Yeah very much so.  Paladins generally just spam FOL anyways holy shock is a PVP talent moreso than PVE. 
---

---
Warrior tanks definitely won't mind sanctuary either.  I always think of holy/prot as a PVP build because of reck bombs
---
---
---
Thats wrong
---
It's not petty rules, it's literally the core of moderation. That's why you don't see a lot of N-bombs being dropped on reddit, we're in agreement that racist shit shouldn't be posted so we accept the moderators remove it.
---
truefaith has +73 healing too
---
I mean troll females actually look somewhat conventionally attractive so i'd be shocked if they were that rare when the game launches.  But yeah nobody wants to be a cowlady.
---
They do scale well, but rolling ignites by a lower geared mage are still going to do more.
---
As I said, in a pure min/max, you prolly wont see more than one lock, but really there wont be that many guilds going that ridiculously hardcore. You are pretty safe rolling a lock as well.
---
Sp/boomy...hope your guild really likes you.
---
They won’t be. Blizzard has stated items will be released in the phase that matches the patch they were released with.
---
Nope, there's no talent inspection in vanilla wow. The closest you'd get to guessing someone's spec would be inspecting their gear... and even then, you could be 100% feral/ret/elemental and just be wearing healing gear.
---
Wolf in sheep's clothing.
---
Where would you need this in MC beside imp packs?
---
Oh I was mistaken about the trinket stun because the undead's stun animation didn't go through so I assumed he just stood there a second like a dumbass. Which he was trying to heal the druid, and the druid didn't die until well after the AoE fear, so the trinket stun didn't really mean anything, tbh.
---
But I wasn't saying 'pretending' for the shaman, but the priest because he tried to gouge follow up the stun and it missed.. but he had shadow reflect and could just save his energy and reflect the fear like he was obviously already ready to do. And the blind was completely wasted on the shaman too. Like he blinded him and then a half second later the fear came out, the shaman both. Wasted his time trying to gouge and wasted a long-term cooldown.
---
The shadow reflect was great of course, it's just that's kind of all that mattered in regards to the shaman/priest so everything else was distracting.
---
Also that warrior swinging Might of Menethil around was responsible for most of the damage on the druid, as well as the kb, looks like (no damage numbers came out on rogue side at the end there).
---
Hunter.
---
Can we do both?
---
Out of all of the paladin builds to call a meme spec, I don't know that leather-wearing healadin would be the top of my list.
---
&gt; I mean troll females actually look somewhat conventionally attractive
---
What the actual fuck?
---
We had a nelf warrior and pleanty of non-dwarf priests on a certain recent private server where everyone was a looooot more neckbeard about min-maxing. In the end no one really cares about how YOU want to play and we still downed raids with not much trouble.
---
That sounds suspiciously like private server shenanigans since Mind Control was supposed to scale with your level plus two or three.
---
I wouldn't still take it from warriors or rogues. It's good, but your raid role doesn't require you to have it. Rather give it to melee dps and main tank warrior. Maybe a good yoinking from BWL pug might do.
---
Played a lot of feral myself, and I can understand the need of standing on org bank/if bridge and showing your DFT to others, though :)
---
They are basically cow terminators.
---
I mean if you're minmaxing for pve you're rolling alliance.  So it makes sense.   Conventional wisdom is alliance racials and paladins are better for pve than horde racials and shaman.
---
What are you talking about?
---
You get it at 30 and it works on mobs up to level 32. You get it again at 44 and it works on mobs up to level 47. Then you don't get it again until level 58. Its usefulness while leveling is extremely limited.
---
Aww. Who hurt you? Was it a feral druid in STV? Did a shadow priest beat you up going to SM summon stone?
---
But if you put it in your batter, it will make your banter bitter. So buy some better banter so your butter is not bitter but a bit better.
---
Music festivals and raves helped me there. Just had to throw myself in the middle of it.
---
The cool thing is that you can choose whatever you want. If you have a tank and healer with you already, all of the DPS classes are open to you and honestly any of them could be hugely beneficial to your group.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just pick what would be most fun to you. :)

pservers coded in autoattack leeway post beta. ability leeway has always been a thing, just without combat reach.

WoW memes just seem way more relevant to memes than WoW, and imo belongs in a subreddit specifically for sharing memes. I wouldn't pop into the relationship advice to share my meme of a couple recieving therapy, nor the europe subreddit to post my meme of Vladimir Putin. Granted it's not all trash memes, it's still not really WoW appropriate content just because WoW is the subject matter imo.
---
Pig is in classic. My understanding is that it was implemented before target icons were, as a way to differentiate pulls.
---
It's not, people just tend to go afk during the trash which can cause wipes.
---
Eh, a lot of specs have come and gone from being meme, even within the same xpac. I remember in wrath Subtlety rogues were seen as memey(?). They had decent exposure in pvp, but even then assassination was better. Boomkins were memes in the recent past...again. in the beginning of legion feral tanks were in a *very* poor spot compared to other tank specs.
---
I was thinking the exact same thing the other day. It’s almost like the devs saw the beta hype and implemented it into mechagon. I wonder how many ppl in decision making roles have been with blizz since Vanilla. My guess would be not many.
---
I'd clarify that those are only meme specs for raiding. Some of those are top-tier PvP specs.
---
Innervate is OK and brez is on a huge CD and only in rare cases will be the difference between wiping and downing a boss.  People are going to be in a for a surprise when they try to run the meme dps classes.
---
I disagree. I think nobody agrees. That's why I disagree.

Just splash some Healing Waves on them bitches and your marriage is safe.

Yeah, except the fact that 90% of those time the hard to fill spots are healers, not dps.

Well now I want one for the horde!

WoW is primarily about two things FOR YOU*: optimization and competition.

---
Man minecraft is pretty much all grinding for random shit, I'm sure kids will be fine with it.
---
If you want to PvP: spriest. It's easy to play but difficult to master and the amazing spriests definitely stick out in a crowd.
---
For PvE: mage has a more "fun" rotation in raids whereas locks pretty much just spam shadow bolt. Locks are more fun tho imo anywhere outside of raids.

Truefaith is straight better.

Both MP5 and +healing are better.

In todays meta nobody cares for mana, because you can reacquire it from a buttload of consumes and abilities (dark runes, demonic runes, innvervate, mana potions etc.)

No such thing for +healing.

SK is generally.acknowledged to be the most fair loot distribution.
---
But it doesn't leverage you loot to create incentives.     
---
DKP /loot council  systems are usually selected *because* they are less fair not despite this feature.
---
And  not always for corrupt reasons.   If a guild wants to progress through hard content, you need ways to motivate and incentivise your members to show up and wipe repeatedly.   Which you can do by awarding dkp or accounting for performance and partipation in a loot council.

Friend told me to come over and try this game on the weekend when I was like 11. Watched him play a human paladin until he was about level 7.
---
Said he was going to bed and if I wanted I could grind him some silver in this mine to learn the game. Told me to vendor at the nearby town when I get too much in the bags. Well I did that, and literally stayed up like 10 hours grinding kobolds for like 60 silver or something ridiculous. I even remember dying before he woke up and being confused by the ghost world. I legit ran around for like 40 minutes and remember thinking how huge this world is. I remember the zone my ghost form was in, it was just westfall lol...
---
Another stupid thing I remember is when I finally learned what scamming was. I was still new to console games somewhat and this fellow had a level 70 warrior and wanted to trade for my 2 day, fresh 70 hunter. This dude was full PVP epics, and some high tier arena mace was on him. I said yes in a heartbeat. I still remember going into AV and falling in love with that warrior destroying dudes, if only for a day. Of course next day the account was in his possession and I couldn't get my account back (was a friends account, but he moved away with the email address access).   
---
At least it inspired me to make a warrior and I had fun with that in TBC/Wotlk/Cata.
---
My understanding (not tested personally) is that for simple /cast macros, the only thing removed is focus. Otherwise, something like "/cast \[@mouseover,help\]\[@player\] Healing Touch;" should work the same way it would on retail. For more more complex macros, scripting stuff, or addon development, I think there are more changes? But I haven't looked at much info for that.
---
Except in wow you can actually kill mobs solo as a healing class.
---
Pretty minuscule thing to get flustered about.  Is everything OK?
---
Naaaa I disagree. If you’re toxic in classic you can only go so far. Classic/vanilla is too dependent on others if you are competitive
---
Ya got me
---
I never said only fury warriors have less crit. It affects all melee, but it's insignificant for rogues while for fury warriors it is devastating. Warriors have different on-crit effects such as Flurry.
---
What this means is that with less crit chance, warriors generate less Rage, which means they are able to use less abilities. Rogues lose nothing else than those extra crits, they can still use just as much of their abilities.
---
&gt;I constantly see warriors beat rogues on DPS, throughtout the tiers, not just in Naxx.
---
On private servers.
---
&gt;IDK where you made this up.
---
From facts.
---
Priests are the most common of the healing classes but the majority of priests end up being shadow for PvP goodness.
---
I will be returning as a holy priest myself and never had a problem before with finding any group and got into raiding fairly easily.
---
[removed]
---
Overwatch did it :p
---
/r/classicwowAITA/
---
Sounds like you weren't a designated DPS in the raid but a designated Tank in the raid, in which case, yes, it would be wrong to ask for the gold. What wouldn't be wrong is saying you don't want to tank and/or finding another guild that had the DPS role available for you.
---
You do realize it literally affects warriors far more? Because it means they get less Flurry procs, which means less auto attacks, which means they generate less Rage, which means they use less abilities per minute.
---
Rogues lose nothing than some crits here and there.
---
&gt;No. It was the talent and balance changes that made Fury good, not Private Servers. 
---
100% utterly false. Fury is far more powerful on private servers.
---
Rogues never do as much damage as warriors. There's no reason to bring rogues unless your tank sucks, which means you better recruit warriors to replace the tank and the rogues next week.
---
Yeah I'm hoping to pay a mage to just follow me around while I quest.
---
On private servers, not on real servers.
---
Will we have many mod options?
---
(I'm really only interested in ones like... Bagnon, Auctioneer, and Postal)
---
Facts are on my side.
---
My guy, world first thaddius kill. Fury warrior topped the meters. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkHSb4cwYPc  warriors were better then and they will be better in classic.
---
The very best Phase 5/6 Rogue spec entirely depends on crits to be viable.
---
BWL is when you need it. Threat is always an issue on horde.
---
These aren't "meme" specs though. Well, besides Oomkin, maybe.
---
Awesome fact and story haha.
---
Can't view
---
I’m seriously considering playing a human priest, just like I did when the game first came out. I liked the extra boost for reputations.
---
depends on the mace. imo it isn't a bad idea to purchase a low level mace in the starting zones.
---
I make it a point to purchase a 2h staff when I reach 1s at level 3 as a shaman for instance. That + rockbiter = 2 shotting things.
---
If its like a level 30 mace or something, yeah you prob fudged up c:
---
The most incorrect and stupid thing I have ever heard anyone say. The very best Rogue spec in raids for all of vanilla, including Phases 5 and 6 is Combat Swords.
---
Seal Fate is 100% incapable of reaching the same DPS, and it only comes close with all melee world buffs.
---
You know nothing about the game, clearly.
---
Your videos would greatly benefit from memorizing what you want to say and making it feel like an organic conversation rather than just reading a script from your screen.
---
Yeah, sadly I was 16-17 years old and did not stand up for myself.
---
You are correct I was signed up as a DPS that was forced to tank.
---
It was 200-300 gold a week back then depending on raid schedule. So I was barely able to reach that gold and still afford repairs(School and stuff).  
---
But thank you for your input, I will now definitely be more open about it. 
---
I want the guild to progress, but also do not want to be taken advantage of because of personal bias to others.
---
iono what you mean by overtuned but I think it's just because people don't really think about long term fighting. Like mages can do all those cool techy things against any given class and the usefulness of those things are clear and easy to understand, but the overall strategy one uses is going to add up to a lot more over time, like in a BG for instance. I mentioned "macro decision making" in another comment in the thread, which is pretty much what I mean by that. I think warlock's have a lot more capacity in that regard. Mages are kind of just a strategic implementation more so that a major contributing factor to possible overall strategy because they're just the CC/burst/kill securing caster.
---
And people just don't really understand the overall strategy warlocks are more conducive to, much less how to properly implement it because they'll just try the mage thing and if they can't kill that guy with the same kind of percussive precision that a mage can, what they could have done differently just doesn't register to them because that's what they're looking for.

---
This is such a r/classicwow thread, it's like perfectly made for this sub.
---
In vanilla I leveled mining/engi as a druid, then later dropped mining for enchanting. Very expensive combination, although engi is fun and still reasonably useful on druids. Otherwise, a gathering profession like herbalism sounds like a good plan, especially if you end up with an alchemy alt.
---
Engineering is tempting, although I'm probably going herb/alch on my main this time around. I'm a potion hoarder, and I find I make better use of them if I can make them myself.
---
I sincerely doubt that you’ve ever been right in your life.
---
Just wondering how asking to be reimbursed for the cost of accommodating could ever be perceived as helping yourself. Also, I have no doubt that someone would think that way.
---
Lolno. Rogues are op on private servers because of crit inflation. Pre-bis warr &gt; rogue, but don't worry rogues are good for farming gold for your reroll warrior main.
---
There's a reason why people aren't rolling rogues as much as they were in vanilla, everyone knows you need to stack groups with mages and warriors now rofl.
---
You're thinking of Nature Swiftness
---
* You need to remember how few items drop in raids in Classic.
---
* Your guild will only ask you to tank, IF you have received a lot of tank gear.
---
* Your guild gave you that tank gear under the assumption that you would tank when needed.
---
* In a nutshell, if you don't want to tank, then don't accept tank gear.
---
could you link to this talent tree spec?
---
I sadly don't think you understand enough about the game to be able to tell what he is doing in half his clips.
---
Same thing with Monkeynews. Could write an essay on most of his fights on what he is doing and why it is beyond 99% of what other warriors are doing, but most people just see "he charged and killed them."
---
My husband will definitely be playing a Druid and I will definitely be playing a Warlock - we are very sure.  How will we play together until level 20 when he has to train in/near Dalaran and I have to in/near Stormwind?  We haven't played in awhile.   Is there something we're overlooking?
---
You'll find a ton of paladin converts who thought they could play ret or prot and still get into raids. Most will be OK at healing because flash of light is easy, but few will be truly good at it. If you want to play holy and you're at all good at it you'll have no trouble finding a raid spot.
---
If they dont feel like tanking and make you do it instead when that is the designated role, then they should indeed pay for it.
---
Most decent guilds will cover respec costs of people to help fill a needed role to clear the raid. If you didnt swap, they wouldn't be running it...pay up fools.
---
Noice!
---
How are they handling older expac levels? i haven't followed it, but at first I wondered what it would do to transmog farming.

Big +.
---
A fury can gear up faster in playing tank and just not taking hunters/rogues/furies, than if they show up in DPS gear.
---
Can we see the wall!
---
If you're dead set on a second crafting profession instead of just gathering to sell, remember you only need to be 35 to max out a crafting profession, so you could go skinning on your main and send mats to your crafting alt to make yourself armor.
---
Blacksmithing is pretty standard for ranking druid flag carriers for the fear immunity trinket. Eng can be useful for a few things but the main thing from them is rocket boots and the goblin version doesn't require eng to use, just to craft. so if you have a goblin eng friend, you should be fine. Or just prepare to be buying a lot of those as druid.
---
Is it recommended to keep the tokens until you are at a certain level and then cash them in?
---
Druids get a free Teleport:MoonGlade spell at level 14.  All druid training can be performed there.  Once done, you can just hearthstone back to wherever you're doing your questing.
---
I'm unaware of any druid trainer near Dalaran?  Did you mean Darnassus?
---
Don't worry, everyone agrees leveling gear is fair game. You can be 99.99% sure knaxx is talking about 60 dungeons.
---
Imagine asking 5 basic and debated to death questions, but thinking you're original.
---
I intend to do skinning and LW til 60 and then swap skinning to enchanting to get the trinket while leveling my alts and farming dungeons and whatnot for mats and gold. I think I'll change out enchanting shortly after phase 2 and take alchemy since I'll have a farming alt mage and some other regular income sources on my other characters. Druids don't really need any professions aside from the huge benefit of that enchanting trinket so it depends on your playstyle and how many characters you'll be using or your guild/ group needs.
---
Very popular.
---
And now because of this concern a fairly complicated and hidden mechanic is now common knowledge. 
---
It's okay to be wrong sometimes. The community gained something from it. I'd rather people are loud about potential issues, prompting extensive research from blizz and the community, than people be silent and incorrect things slide through.
---
I dunno. Just my two cents.
---
Modern wow does suck though.
---
I know there were quite a few addons that got made during the beta, but no idea how extensive it will be once classic actually launches.
---
Pretty sure Twitch/Curse will have a Classic Wow section.  If someone wants an addon bad enough, a creator may pick it up and reconfigure it for Classic.
---
Poor Chooga.
---
Now that's great. Awesome stuff..
---
1. nothing particular for priests that stands out. in dreams maybe, but everyone should do that quest so its nothing priest specific.
---
2. there are always guilds on both factions, that shouldn't be a problem.
---
3. the ranks you use depend on your gear and also on your style. there is just not 1 answer to this, it will change with your gear and the content. i always went with a 600 1100 1500 hp and max rank slow heal and only max rank flash heal. flash heal should only be used for emergencies anyway and anything but max rank is kinda dumb. some guilds will have some trihard healers that will snipe a lot with flash heals to top healing meters. in such a setting you kinda have to downrank flashheals too.
---
4. the difference is marginal and the biggest benefit from truefaith is probably the looks, they are almost on par. u trade 5 healing and 6 mp5 for 11spirit and 5 int. 
---
5. renew isn't the worst spell, its very efficient when downranked once you have 800+ healing. it can fuck with aggro though and is mostly useless for pvp. the talent is the worst though, don't ever waste points on it.
---
6. this is almost the ideal pve holy spec. spirit of redemption is a waste for raids though. firstly, if a healer is dying the pull is probably fucked anyway and secondly you should have a soulstone (if not blame the warlocks). the extra healing from spirit will help you more overall.
---
i would still not recommend using that spec. mostly in the disc tree you should take martyrdom and improved manaburn. the threat shouldn't be needed with somewhat capable tanks and fade. mental agility is not a bad talent but a little overrated and especially for pve healing not that useful. with those changes you now have a spec thats also very good equipped for pvp healing while still being more than fine for pve content.
---
Some form of loot council addon will surely be made. At least thats what I keep telling myself
---
Yis boi!

&gt; The feral could have also not been geared correctly

Loot council or DKP Tracker, for sure.  The modern API is too good not to have something as convenient as this.
---

---
Ms is a high priority debuff which means if it’s up it pushes things off the table not the other way around. 
---
Even in a 20 man, there are enough useful debuffs that putting me up will knock others off. 
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if no guilds who can consistently form a raid and kill bosses would let you raid. Maybe mc and omg once zg and aq are out. 
---
But you being there would be not only an annoyance but a direct detriment to the success of the group and anyone who cares about their performance. Not that shazzrah can’t be killed if a ms debuff goes up. Just more like I’d be mega pissed if my ignite fell off because of that, or if I had to recast coe or of shadow vuln was ticked off. Even in a pug, you’d be liable to be kicked if people noticed—despite it not being “needed” per se—it’s just disrespectful to the people you’re playing with and the larger process in general. 
---
But what do I know
---
https://arctium.io/
---
Ikr, the closer it gets the farther away it seems :(
---
Generally it's being dicks to each other in terms of mob kiting, quest mob tagging, stealing nodes, moonfiring a mage's target while the frostbolt is mid-air, that kind of stuff lol
---
It hasn't been announced whether you need to be subbed or not **But** judging from past tests... you will need a sub.
---
Druid teleoprt to moonglade is 10, as it's part of the Druid quest for bear form, most likely you'll be able to level together after that, but it depends on a lot of factors.
---
Why are mages so popular? I played way back in the day (up until Cataclysm) and my first main was a warrior, but I didn't want to tank so I got sidelined a lot. Then I rolled a mage and loved it and was one forever.
---
I want to go back to being a mage, but I see here that a lot of people are apparently going to be one. But in all the other threads I hardly see people mentioning mages in general. Should I try to role a healer? I've never healed so I'm just nervous I'd suck at it.
---
Yup I agree. It does make blizz more money so it makes sense. But as a customer, I hate this idea.
---
I’m pretty dead set on enchanting that i didn’t really think of waiting to pick it up second. Could be a solid plan to go mining/engineering (or even mining/skinning to level), then drop skinning for engineering, max out engineering, then drop the mining for enchanting. Nice thought, thanks! 
---
I agree on the alchemy. I’ll definitely want an alchemist alt just for convenience of being able to self craft.
---
Sounds like the best we're going to get.  Thanks!
---
It is the best feature, at least we can agree on that ;)
---
Thanks!
---
Gnome rogue gang
---
Thanks - yeah my alt plan would be get to 35 for this reason and then probably casually up to 60 over time when i feel like i need a druid break.
---
Jesus I can't believe it's been that long since it was announced
---
Lol used to stand behind the fence near the alliance AV entrance and MC that elite battlemaster or whatever he was. Could usually kill a good 3-4 idiots before they found me.
---
It sounds like something that a guild should State their policy on upfront. Probably right alongside the rest of their raiding rules,
---
6 months per pgaseighr kill the game it would be so slow, 4 month for AQ phase seems fine but 2-3 mo other than p5/6
---
This guy gets it.  I will be GMing on east coast Alliance with the same strategy.  Frankly vanilla raids aren't that engaging on their own merits.  The bosses are simple and so are the rotations.  What engages and motivates people is the social ecosystem of 40 people fucking around and making memories.  I'm dedicated to clearing Naxx, but the biggest hurdle to doing that is getting people to be active and put the time in, and the best way to make that happen is to get people into a fun social ecosystem to the point where the actual raiding is almost just an excuse to hang out with their friends.  People will keep showing up for that, not because they really enjoy casting Frostbolt.

Having friendly and hostile dispel. With proper planning and consumable usage there's basically nothing you can do against me because fuck you I've got skull of impending doom and a free action potion and none of my homies are getting polymorphed tonight.

That's dope!

It's something they're worried about infesting the sub closer to release.  Jesus Christ
---
This whole subreddit is in for such a rude awakening
---
The tweet is from 2017
---
Hahaha Newfoundland myself
---
Ya I was Loremaster in release so been there done that and excited to do it again.  Currently I'm trying to decide between Holy Paladin(I guess ret to level), Mage, Priest, and maybe Warlock in that order.
---
The great thing is holy pallies stack so well in raids as well...
---
Able to pass out every pally buff + have access to insanely unending healing because you have 6 holy pallies? Spectacular, lol.
---
That's a vaid point to make about it. It just seems so unnecessary and stunts income in comparison to almost any other choice in my eyes. Leatherworking gives you gear as you go and will get you your devilsaur BiS and skinning helps that happen while netting some extra gold along the way. Enchanting is pretty much required imo and helps out a ton on a fresh server for my playstyle and speed and after I get the devilsaur pieces and enchanting benefits out of the way I'm free to swap to more lucrative opportunities. I farm a lot and end up becoming a goblin after my first 3 toons are leveled and raid ready though.
---
Warlock for PvP synergy And Warlock and then maybe Hunter for PvE? Warlock synergizes the best, thats for sure.
---
r/woosh
---
We have a few guilds it’s not all Canadian for them but looks like we are looking at EST,CST,MST,
---
I guess this is somewhat true. Out of my friend groups none of them are into WoW, or any MMOs at all.
---
For me, my dad and I have been on and off of wow since Vanilla. It's pretty funny to think that my first toon is as almost as old as me.
---
Smart people pick green.
---
Another elitest, another day. Am I pushing anything on you? All the post was about, with no edits mind you, was how if you are going to play your hybrid, what you should do to maximize your value to the raid. 
---
The only one pushing is you.
---
&gt; Aww. Who hurt you?
---
Posting threads with questionable advice and adding some prime soy reddit speak to the mix, good stuff m'lord.
---
Dungeons yes. Raids. Not at all.

Paladin is far more doable in raids than Shaman

Feral is complete and utter garbage, stop trolling.

Balancing classes for PVE and World PVP due to arena problems is, and has always been, bullshit.  They kept nerfing the shit out of all of the fun Engineering trinkets for the same reason.  If you want perfect balance in Arena, then normalize everyone *in the goddamn Arena* and let everything go back to normal when you get out.
---
SWTOR (yes, I know that BC and early Wrath predated TOR) normalized stats in battlegeounds for exactly this reason.  There's no reason why they can't do it that way this time, except laziness.
---
... it is as if nobody remembers combat daggers / swords, and the disgusting amounts of sustained damage those builds kicked out. 
---
And yeah, attack power is everything.
---
This whole subreddit is in for such a rude awakening lol. It's pretty easy to have everyone love you in raids as a hybrid, just spec healer. Everybody loves healers.
---
What is it that's so great about DPSing that it makes someone want to put themselves in competition with the most cutthroat role in the entire game when they already have a competitive niche that they're amazing at? DPS is the most disposable role in the game and DPS frequently have their applications declined or get kicked out of guild for underperforming by a few percentage points. Another thing is DPS is easily the most closely scrutinized role in the game, why put yourself through that when the outcome is already known.
---
Is there a back to it? You went so far but it looks so flat in the wall, I woulda had it hanging out to give that shop keeper vibe
---
Portal roulette at the end of raids was my go to
---
I love the Borbweaver and Corsair Scimitar.  I could not imagine playing without them (I actually bought backups because I could not imagine playing without them).
---
For the orbweaver, the first thing is the flexibilitythe joystick gives you to use other fingers.  I think the thumb is the most neglected finger on the gaming keyboard, and it becomes the most critical with the orbweaver.  You need to adjust your key binds for things like jump, but once you get use to it, it is natural.  With the other four digits of that hand, I maintain my instant spells (Heal over times, nature swiftness macros, innervate, bark skin, nature's grasp, animal forms).  My Corsair manages my cast spells, particularly direct heals, lus i throw my lesser used spells there (decurse, abolish poison).  It becomes second nature.  I standardized placement on my bars, for instance, 7-9 on my corsair are bound to Shift+3 1,2,3 (third bar for the third row).  
---
I know you can play with shift and alt functions, but I happen to really like the macros I make for the keybinds more.  They can be made into super macros with global cooldowns worked into it.  An example would be to shift from animal form, cast NS and a heal, and shift back.  That is just one click.  So much easier.

How viable is Shaman 5 mans dungeons, and in BGs and solo PVP? I've always played pallys and rogues. Is there a huge learning curve? I imagine so with all the totems and stuff. I saw on some poll where Shamans would be the least chosen character and thought it might be cool to do something new.
---
I always got my throwing weapon skill up those things lol.
---
No gnomes?
---
Odds are that'll be how it plays out, tanks being the hot commodity they are.
---
Which would then compel me to build a tank set, so I'll declare for Tank and DPS items and probably pound sand thereafter.
---
Question. 
---
When looking at an enhancement shaman’s dps are you including all the damage applied to other classes? Like the extra damage rogues and warriors are doing from wind fury/agility buffs, is that extra damage included in how much damage the enhancement shaman is bringing to the raid? Or are people just looking at meters of just the enhancement shaman damage on his own?
---
Definitely agree, I’ve never played a healer so it’ll be a fun experience to raid as resto but Hope to collect ele gear on the side.
---
Priest one seems active. Thanks for the heads-up!
---
As long as it takes
---
Can I play Handlock
---
&gt; Also, that last bit wasn't about DPS doing their job though, this was specifically about how to bring a hybrid class and stand out. There will ALWAYS be mages and hunters in the raid. There is not stigma on them. But people think bringing hybrids will literally lose them the raid and hit all enrage timers humanly possible and auto wipe after zoning in.
---
First of all I'd say I agree with you people are generally too fussed about this shit, I've managed raids with a prot pala MT and a druid OT in a shite casual guild. Shit died even if it wasn't particularly optimal, so I don't have any doubts about whether it's possible.
---
Though I do think that, despite the fact there will always be mages and hunters, your points still apply to them. Even if there are 6 slots for mages and you're practically safe, standing out is still going to help you. You'll be a much more appreciated asset to the raid if you're going above and beyond to contribute instead of just shooting frostbolts until you're ordered to do otherwise.
---
Trueee
---
My bad, when I clicked it on my phone this morning it brought up some random monologue.
---
I’m in. I’ll play enhancement shaman for you
---
 Cheers, I shall get in touch closer to launch and such.
---
A resto can drop totems too. No enhance will spec into improved windfury totem, perhaps improved str totem at a minimum.
---
Be cool to Horde in your area, let them get kills and let them SEE you let them get the kill. Give them distance and show them you mean no harm and are willing to let them do their thing in peace. 60% of the time, it works every time.
---
Literally impossible for a mage to have Thunderfury.
---
doesn't work like that. the client reads information from the server database. this is why, when a pserver fixes a bug/changes something, you don't need to download a new patch (i'm guessing you haven't played a pserver before)
---
What if the Enhance is speccing I to most totem points to work as more of an support role giving the resto shamans leeway to put points in more beneficial slots?
---
They are probably under the dresses of those Priests in the back spawning water...
---
Linking to a random build on wowhead without any useful commentary isn't really, well, useful.  Or needed.
---
You're assuming a single-tank group dynamic, which is meta/end game.  In Classic many specs (and pets) served as OTs, and were useful for taking down various obstacles outside of 60 dungeons and raids.  When you actually raid you have mostly warrior tanks anyway, I don't know what private servers have to do with.. oh wait, private servers are where the 'meme spec' joke originated.  Which is why as I said, there is/was no such thing in actual classic.
---
That's the guild pictured.
---
&lt; No Gnomes &gt;
---
And gimp the dps of the enhance even further? If you're only bringing one for nightfall or something, sure, but i think literally every raid leader would rather have a resto with bad totems over an enhance with the best totems (again, unless they have nightfall).
---
Shamans are great in 5 mans and pvp. As well as raising. All around good healer with more support strength than any other healer
---
Agreed.  I don't have much lock experience.  But having played against great ones in Vanilla pushing my bg group to several High Warlords the control they can establish over multiple players is pretty disgusting.  I don't think other classes have that small group control and outplay potential like locks do.  I'm sure there's more nuances in 1v1s too that I'm just not familiar with.
---
Druids to me fit this bill too.  The amazing druids I ran with blew my mind when I compared them to the other druids.  It was like a whole different class when the person was actually skilled at what they were doing and in what order and in what situation.  They weren't just glorified flag runners like people think.  The outplays and clutch fights were awesome.
---
Yes, tons of addons
---
Are you including the added dps to other classes to the  dps that appears on the meter for the enhancement shaman or just the shaman alone in this scenario?
---
Ahhh I'd have it extend out long ways just to appreciate the beauty of it.  Desk spaces schmeksspace- it's up in the air you got tons of room, it would look way cooler  like "this is the item shop area" if it where hanging up above like in game. It would feel more immersive and nerdy that way rather than just what's essentially a  plaque on a wall appreciating it q:
---
For mages its wands you can get in the 30s. So not as big a deal but still cool
---
Interesting. There's a thread [here](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/711098-Thunderfury) arguing about who can use it. Some people seem to think the class restriction wasn't actually in place and was just on the tooltip? Very odd. Warlock didn't even occur to me for some reason.
---
Why in the world would you put 26 points into BM and not get frenzy?
---
The cash shop will keep retail going whether its really a "good" game or not. Losing subs isn't good, but as long as a few whales spend hundreds, even thousands of dollars in the cash shop, it more than covers the loss of active subs. I'm not a fan of microtransactions, I still hold out for games where you have to earn things or, barring that, just get plain lucky. But, cash shops have been an absolute boondoggle for game developers, actibliz included. Classic is a relic game, plain and simple. That said, I do think a chunk of gamers have been playing retail and other mmos with a deep seeded hope that the game they love, old wow, would return. And here we are.
---
When I enter a dungeon with 4 other players counting on me to keep them alive, I make sure that I'm specced properly to do the job.  I've never made it harder on myself by carrying a bunch of points in DPS talents, thereby weakening my ability to keep the group healthy.  That's just my thing.  Leveling might take longer but I'm not in any rush.
---
Get creative with emotes against enemy/griefers, find people in the same zone to quest with, etc. With that said, you'll die a lot. We'll all die a lot. It's part of the game on a pvp server. Try to fight back and hone your pvp skills...it's not like people will ever stop ganking (even after you're 60) on a pvp server.
---
I've honestly been seriously considering making the whole bracing system to make it look like it's hanging from a rafter. You might have pushed me into making it happen!
---
I assume by vanilla you mean blizzard's original vanilla because on modern private servers it's pretty common. People may not like giving up loot but people also don't like tanking as is clear by the constant role bottleneck. It's hard, expensive work. Simple supply and demand.
---
Besides, I wasn't suggesting he reserve *all* of the things I listed at once. Greys or chests are not so valuable that people will sit around for another 1+ hours looking for a "less greedy" tank.
---
I’d like to hear more about this.  This could be a good option, and warlocks are an interesting class.  My concern is how much of a Warlock is being a DPS and how much of it is providing utility like debuffs and such?
---
i mean things like improved windfury totem barely even put a dent in the groups dps, probably wouldn't even be noticable. other than the str totem, that's all you have and a resto could easily spec into that.
---
No one but Warriors, Hunters, Rogues, and Paladins can obtain the quest in Vanilla. The class restriction was later removed for achievement folks.
---
You are correct.
---
The 3 days free doesn’t extend past July.
---
Really? I could have sworn there was VERY limited amount that was compatible.
---
Superior Striking doesn't affect bear form and shouldn't be listed as the enchant for Bear, but instead Agility or Strength
---
Not really sure what kind of point you are trying to make. Noone is saying meme specs replace healing.
---
For the horde!
---
I think he means Frank as in Frank Herbert.
---
Things like that happen a lot less in vanilla.

\- ETS will be a newly formed Semi hardcore/progression Alliance guild come Classic Launch (PvP server to be announced) I personally have been playing since Vanilla. Clearing all content from MC-Nax 40. 4 horseman was where I hit my first wall with both raiding guilds in classic. I was in a top US 50 guild from BC-Cata. 12xGlad across 3x multi classes. OG rank 14. I will be building a strong raiding foundation going into classic. At this time my main focus is get people who are serious on hitting max level relatively quick. Ones that are interested in taking part in officer roles even assisting or main raid leading. I am not recruiting a full roster at this time as lets face it. Most people will not level at the speed I would be happy with or just plan on being casual which is not my focus at this time. Raiding schedule will be 4x a week. Raiding time will be 8:30-11:30 Eastern time Tues-Friday

---
Yes you can...
---
Only if you want to see a grown man cry...
---
Also, dagger fury warriors for non-human races are a thing. Also, not looking at axes which are warrior and hunter competition. The 1h AQ axe for warriors is also one with int on it.
---
Holy damage isn't that bad if you play it right.  Wands are pretty strong, and if you get spirit tap + Spiritual Guidance you can drop some fat holy fires on monster heads to start fights.
---
Yeah I didn't get hard into raiding until tbc but our raid leader was a holy priest and we were very successful
---
Spoiler alert, vanilla was the same way. Any guild who was raiding had BiS lists they were following too.
---
At first, I only bought armor on the AH. And I can still remember vividly as I tested the boundaries of the zeppelin. Yeah, those don’t have invisible walls like I thought. That was a costly mistake and run back.
---
Imagine a Feral Druid running the dungeon 24/7, always gets the item gifted from his group and then proceeds to sell it himself on an alt
---
Does anyone know why leeway felt so much worse on beta then? I played vanilla, pservers and beta and for some reason on the beta leeway was so noticeable in both PvE and PvP compared to anything I’ve encountered before.
---
I’m not for or against it, just wondering why that would be the case
---
There is no such thing as a hybrid in vanilla WOW, start getting that thinking out of your head.  There is healer classes.  It has nothing to do with being an elitist, you are literally giving shit advice.  People straight up don't want these classes in their raids whether they are hardcore or not.  There is plenty of good specs to choose from, stop pushing bad ones.
---
THey take a slot that would be a fury warrior for all the damage side, crushing the feral, and in an oh shit moment, like you know when the tank dies and presumably this bear tank would get into gear, the fury could just hit shield wall while you get the tank up.
---
Oh and the fury would be higher on threat assuming you cant taunt. So for all the times the tank doesnt die, the fury is doing double the damage of your vaunted feral tank. Meanwhile in the what 5% of cases he has the tank its the same thing. Maybe if you are in a guild that needs another brez or something.
---
This though.
---
Over a guild mate lol. OK.
---
I'm gonna use your shop for repairs and nothing else
---
Popular as in everyone wants you to help them do an instance?  Yes. 
---
Popular as in "there's all these holy priests standing around Org/IF" Not really.  
---
They will not be as common as Warriors, mages, or Shamans/Paladins.  They will probably be close to rogues / hunters in representation, ahead of warlocks and druids (though there may be more warlocks horde side).
---
Irrelevant to the post but WoW is very CPU heavy compared to GPU heavy which is why you were only at 100 fps with a 1080. When I had a 8th gen i7 with a 1060 I got 120+ frames on very high settings. Which was better then my buddy with a 5th gen i5 with a 1080 ti.
---
yeah it's not like we have countless videos of pserver footage already, let's take the one instance where you can clearly see one player skipping distance due to desync
---
i really should avoid arguing on reddit
---
NO
---
Right no one actually WANTS the meme specs, some people are just forced to haul them along due to lack of better options, and everyone in the raid really knows it deep down.
---
So long as the raid is progressing through easy content no one will say much.  
---
But these are the raids that are going to collapse in drama, and the geared competent players will move on to greener pastures while the bads call them stuck up elitists.  And pretend that they aren't bads, they re just casuals.
---
&gt;Will you be playing, either primarily or occasionally, as an off-spec for your class?
---
I plan on playing enhance hopefully for raiding but mostly for pvp.
---
&gt;Do off-specs have a place in raiding?
---
Some do, some don't. I don't see boomkins, prot pallies, or ele shams being taken but possibly the others.
---
&gt;Do off-specs have a place in PVP, solo-leveling, or 5-man dungeons?
---
Absolutely
---
&gt;Is Classic flexible in terms of whether or not off-specs can be successful?
---
Not particularly. Gear sets are specialized and there's not much non-set gear to fill the gaps.
---
&gt;Do you have a favorite off-spec?
---
I've always enjoyed both ele and enhance throughout my wow career (vanilla-present on and off)
---
&gt;Are people worrying too much about off-specs, and just need to mind their own/their guild's own business?
---
probably. i understand people being cautious of leveling 'for an offspec' and that raiding was easy and blah blah blah but i'd hate for someones entire game to be ruined because they leveled a class thinking it's something that it's not.
---
what are you raid times. 
---
Looking for a chill guild aswell
---
Too many shenanigans possible with no sub requirement.
---
I only RP walk so I don't got anything to worry about.
---
Has uTorrent as name, doesn't condone gold buying. Who'da thunk it?
---
Yep I was being extra subtle.  :)
---
Fat agree. 
---
Neckbear nation had to do this with M1-M2-MMB and scrolls. Rest were blood sweat and keyboard binds
---
So what's better, 2/3 imp blizz (so you can get 8 second cone of cold slow) or 3/3 imp blizz?
---
Its amazing in 5 mans, because you can only bring 5 people. In raids its so much better to have specialists that are amazing at a single role.
---
desync/i stood still. where else does it happen? this is perfect deadzoning, which wont be consistently possible with leeway like it is here.
---
During cata, guildies and I would MC people in Sethria’s Roost in Hyjal and jump them off into Felwood (or maybe it was Ashenvale).  Priest would MC, a mage would put slowfall on them so they fall far enough to die in Felwood.  
---
If done right, your corpse was unreachable from where the spirit healer would put you in Felwood, and you didn’t get one of those ghost flying mounts.  Spirit res was basically the only option.  Great times.
---
Lol. Just give it up. In Chinese we say 对牛弹琴. It means you are playing piano for a cow. It’s just a waste of time to communicate with retards like this.
---
You can also swiftness pot every 2 minutes and they are super cheap to make
---
Already found a guild to play with, but best of luck to you guys.
---
That towel is for all the tears OP will weep in every contested zone. Also, the flag is a fire hazard - should just go ahead and burn it.
---
Any bender quote is a good quote
---
Keep your health and mana at higher levels than you're used to, especially if you're in a popular quest area for both factions.
---
**Regularly** pan your camera 360 degrees around you to check for enemy players that may or may not want to harass you. Set your view distance as high as your computer can handle. Set your max camera zoom as far as it will go.
---
Something to note, more and more group members can move to the "meme" specs the more you progress. If you have more than enough healers, no point in keeping them all as healers when you could down the boss faster.
---
in 2019? not really relevant me thinks.
---
Cool survey.
---
Remember to send me pics if you do :D
---
It was working on the AV server during Beta. I was unfortunately a victim but I saw it happen to a few others, too. I'm pretty sure it didn't stop movement because when it happened to me it seemed like a smooth turn and I didn't notice my character stop
---
It’s almost as if dps isn’t the only thing classes can bring to a raid.

#  &lt;Coup&gt; | NA |Alliance | PvE Server | Middlecore Raiding | Fri/Sat Evenings PST
---
# About Us:
---
&lt;Coup&gt; is a guild with almost 15 years of history, originally formed in vanilla on the Shadowsong-US server. Coup was a top raiding guild on the server during vanilla, scoring several server firsts across BWL and AQ40, including server first Nefarian. Since then we’ve stuck together through almost every expansion with a fairly consistent core of 15-20 members, and are looking to ramp our numbers up to have a healthy community in classic, as well as to support the 40 man raid scene.
---
I’m referring to Coup as “Middlecore” because we plan to raid, but won’t likely push hard on bleeding edge progression. We will always welcome a wide variety of players and playstyles. This ranges from people who always want to play at the top of their game, all the way through to those who want to take the scenic route through the game.
---
Due to the nature of 40 man raiding we will need some consistency in the raid roster, but we also place no pressure on our people when real life happens. If you need to take a sabbatical from raiding or the game in general, we may backfill your role, but the guild will still be here and you will still be a member when you get back. We’ve always treated this game as part of our hobby and not a job, and we’ve been able to maintain many of the same friends and guild members for over a decade as a result. We hope that in Classic we can maintain that M.O.
---
**What we are looking for:**
---
* We want to build a community first, and then our raiding team later. More than anything we want to find like-minded adults who want to enjoy the game with us.
---
* At some point (ideally around or before content Phase 2) we would like to get the point where we are able to consistently clear current content while it is current.
---
**What are aren’t looking for:**
---
* Toxicity, racism, bigotry, homophobia, or other generally awful behavior. During the Blizzcon opening ceremony Chris Metzen always used to end with a saying; “Be good to each other”… We intend to do just that, and invite people that will conduct themselves in a positive manner.
---
If you are interested in learning more, please reach out to me via DM here on Reddit, or via discord @ Evilmonstar#7541.
---
Thanks for reading, and we can’t wait to see you in Classic!
---
I've forgotten more about vanilla than you have learned in your entire life. Only played it in retail vanilla from week 2, I only just finished clearing the entire content with a bear 3rd tank.
---
It was miserable the entire time, oh great he does a bit more threat that ally dont even need due to salv. I only saw a pure aq bis bear tank get annihilated on patchwerk and overall just a drain on healers for no benefit.
---
TBH You are going to use ZG ring set in P4 and Brood rep+C'thun/viscidus ring in P5. Doesn't change the fact that Accuria isn't going to be used past P4 anyways.
---
if that guildmate insists on being dps despite the raid being low on healers? any day.
---
Hunter dps + heals and ither utility. Stop the hate train.
---
I'd be interested!  
---
I played vanilla from nearly day 1, with my main as an Arms Warrior with tanking experience, Vanilla 40-man experience in an elite guild as well as top 25 realm pvp ranking at my peak.  I also had a bunch of alts...pretty much every class.  Overall I'm a fairly slow leveler and enjoy the variety, you may find me on my alts more than you'd like.  But I like your expectations and the region is optimal and I feel like I can provide a lot, as well as make a couple of the hardcore raid nights, at least.  
---
That being said, I'm not sure how much I'll be playing compared to the days of Vanilla, which was HS and college for me.  Excessive playing got me academically suspended, so I'm going to try not to get too sucked in.  Now I have a full-time job, occasional travels, D&amp;D nights, etc etc.  But like I said, looking to start again, would like a semi-casual, semi-serious guild on an RP server.  
---
I was considering rolling a Dwarf Priest as my main but, as hinted at above, will certainly have one of almost every class, just leveling at different paces :)
---
It's not pointless, hunter's Trap is a much more reliable AOE slow than blizzard (even 3 of them)  3 mages dancing around mobs in a hunters trap slow using CoC and AE instead of blizzard &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blizzard. Blizzard on Clear casting procs is great also. You would still want the imp blizzard for things that got out of the area, but once you ball things up, keeping them in a trap is not hard.
---
Lol
---
math is out there, -20% xp per level less then you.
---
This looks awesome, nice work!
---
overall it's okay to kill mobs 1 level less then you and 1 above you. Ideally equal level grind. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7n23dn/grinding_xp_grid_amount_of_mobs_you_need_to_kill/
---
2/3 imp blizz, 2 or 3/3 perma frost and CoC slow should last its cooldown. If you rely on the blizz 3/3 slow you will often find mobs getting out of your slow CC group (even with permafrost).
---
I think its 100% exp if the mob is the same level with a continual 20% reduction per level difference.
---
Your exp rate is a function of time taken to kill the mob, time spent recovering life and/or mana, and travel time to the next mob.
---
If you kill a mob one level under you for 80% exp but you do it 20% faster and need 10% less time to recover then this is net 10% faster.
---
It's obviously complicated and requires specific testing, and is further complicated if other players are nearby and what type of mobs you're fighting at any given time.
---
Also if you're on a pvp server grinding in Hillsbrad you dont want to drop to 30% hp by fighting mobs 2 levels higher.  You'll be the easiest pickings on the server that way.
---
Lots to think about.  For me theres too much to consider and it wouldn't be fun for me to undertake.
---
If you're bored there are a ton of resources on youtube.  Any of Kargoz's class specific deep drives has these exp tables linked to mob levels as well as some general considerations.
---
You really have to get in-game to figure a lot of this stuff out and the testing period is over.  It may be better to just roll with it and see what is fun and interesting for you.
---
&gt; removal of any and all barriers, mechanical and social.
---
sure, for the easiest content available.
---
&gt; Problem is that retail WoW still makes shit tons of money from microtransactions despite the lowest subscription numbers ever.
---
Lowest subscription numbers that are still 10-20x more than what Classic is supposed to be bringing in.
---
I know you prefer classic, I'm going to be playing it too... it doesn't mean you have to lie about the state of retail.
---
Really wanted to believe that was a toaster oven on the right. Who needs to call "bio" when you've got that and a bed pan?
---
Waaah I can't be an edgy loser and push my semi ironic but fully cringy white supremacist lite worldview waaaah
---
Argent defender + shield spike is pretty disgusting for aoe tanking as  it provides excellent defense against many small hits as well as threat.
---
That is 100% incorrect.
---
You're saying that anything more than 5 levels below you gives 0% exp lol. There is a chart for this, and it's much more applicable to this thread than simply linking the amount of exp required per level (which has nothing to do with what OP asked).
---
AB here aswell. Random small town boy
---
Thanks for taking the time to do this.
---
Don't worry it's velcroed on. Ez fix!
---
Here's a link that somebody shared on here a while back:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
https://archive.org/details/@wowmoviearchive?sort=titleSorter
---
It's a bunch of PvP videos dating mostly from Vanilla to WotLK and the search function is pretty decent all things considered.
---
😭😭😭linking an item on video game trade chat is literal white supremacy 😭😭😭 it’s literally pushing a worldview😭😭😭i hate it I hate make it stop I hate it 😭😭😭
---
don't forget about death knights!
---
UBRS:
---
* If they have enough braincells to dismiss pet before jumping in the arena
---
* If they actually use trap when needed
---
* If they flare the groups that have stealthed mobs
---
* If they can actually kite Drakisath
---
For more fun stuff you can ask them to solo one of the ony attunement drakes (the horde side ones), bronze is the easiest but green is also doable (and red as well, afaik), or just ask them to solo a devilsaur. You'd have to be pretty bad to fail at that.
---
I'd add also having decent control over their pet+blocking line of sight with CCed targets so that Multi-shot doesn't hit CCed targets, but that's unlikely to work in Classic, since [Multi-Shot can chain through walls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSWFwr0xf-Y&amp;t=10s).
---
Threat has never been the issue.
---
[https://youtu.be/By8Ny6BJwKY?t=99](https://youtu.be/By8Ny6BJwKY?t=99)  
---
Female Tauren hitbox is 0.3 yards smaller according to this dude's breakdown. Really no other hard data on the subject as far as I'm aware.   
---
Some say it's easier to get thru certain doorways as female too, but I dunno about that one.
---
Agreed.
---
Oh really, people shared BiS lists two months before the game released which included content that was not even thought off? Interesting.
---
The biggest problem with classic is layering.
---
Assuming you have the engineering should or the thorns trinket off ragnaros I don’t see why not.
---
No those people make me want to throw up. Thank god they’ve purged The Nicker, but we need to be vigilant. Now these DISGUSTING Nazi white supremacists just take other innocuous things and try to literally LYNCH items like [Slavedriver’s Cane](https://www.wowhead.com/item=13372/slavedrivers-cane#comments), the [Black Menace](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=6831), and [Big Black Mace](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=7945). Luckily changing the name of The Nicker has finally ended white supremacy. But we need to make sure to stop innocuous items from being misconstrued. If Blizzard doesn’t change the name of all of these items I will unsubscribe and report them to the ACLU.
---
I recall Shedo saying that powershifting is a 40% dps increase. Make of that what you will.
---
This trip through time has sucked.
---
I hope this is copy pasted every time people start shrieking about “leeway bad game is broken &gt;:(“. This is a great explanation.
---
Lol you post on an incel sub. You can't even spell. A lot is two words dumb dumb.
---
Get it together man.
---
I love kiting and control. Shattering for big burst is super fun too.
---
7-10pm Tuesday and Wednesday. (optional Monday clean up day)
---
If you scrunch up your eyes while looking at enhancement, it might look like an unfinished tank tree, but that’s just because enhancement is kind of everything. It has defensive talents, melee offense talents, caster talents, buffer talents, movespeed/utility talents... it’s a mess. There may have been a dev that wanted to make them tanks, but that tree was going in so many directions, it’s more accurate to say that enhancement wasn’t clearly intended to fit any of the traditional dps/support/tank roles specifically.
---
XVI
---
No one wants mortal strike and deep wounds tho
---
It's not in stock because my guild bought 'em out.
---
That is so fucking dope!
---
Soul stone has a 30min cd in vanilla...
---
Ya bra
---
Open energy drink in perfect LOS of your right elbow just waiting to be spilled onto your sparkly toaster. 
---
Check.
---
Unfortunately not.  Best of luck with your guild search.
---
In turn you enable DPS player's dreams by providing superior threat.
---
Thanks for the great idea!
---
I've literally been denied recruitment by "midcore" guilds for race choice (gnome fury warrior).
---
It's an actual thing, whether it's absurd or not.
---
Can't do any validation on pservers. The boss dps numbers aren't even remotely close
---
I accept this.  
---
Lok'Tar Ogar brother.
---
It's 100% not a recommended way to level, and you will find yourself ineffective at most things.
---
The reason I say not recommended is because you can probably hit 60 not using any talent points at all, it's just a matter of how awful you want the experience to be.
---
A deep prot lvl 60 grind is a miserable experience unless you have a 24/7 questing buddy. You will regret it.
---
This is an awful video. Not because of the presentation, but because of the lack of diligence in finding out if this information is accurate. There are a number of mistakes that could have been found with a couple minutes of research. Not to mention that we have known about progressive availability of items for months now. There is no excuse for posting a guide without doing a minimum amount of research first... and only continues to perpetuate misinformation. 
---
Or could have compared it to the other numerous pre-raid bis lists that have been released and asked why there were such big discrepancies. 
---
Or you could have someone review your list. 
---
Helm: 
---
* Sanctified Leather Helm is almost assuredly not available until Phase 5 as it was added in patch 1.11. Not only that, but if you happen to look up the quest that gives it you would notice it was from the Argent Dawn Pre-Naxx events. 
---
Video also claims you need exalted with Argent Dawn. This is not true. Being exalted merely reduces the amount of mats you need for the quest. 
---
Neck:
---
* Animated chain necklace will not likely be available until Phase 2 as it was added in patch 1.4. 
---
* Amulet of the Redeemed. Will for sure not be available until the tier .5 questline is available as is drops from the summoned bosses from that chain. In contrast the video claims it drops from "multiple mobs in Strathholme."
---
Shoulders:
---
* Mantle of lost hope: Not available in phase 1. 
---
Back: 
---
* Hide of the Wild: The creator admits he isn't sure that this will be available in phase 1. If that's the case why didn't he look it up? Even a quick google search would show the pattern drops from Dire Maul
---
Legs: 
---
* Ghoul Skin: Not available until Phase 2. 
---
Feet: 
---
* Soot Encrusted: Not available until Phase 5. 
---
* Firemoss: Ditto. 
---
* Faith Healers: Ditto. 
---
Ring: 
---
* Band of Piety: Same issue as Sanctified Leather Helm. 
---
* Mending: Requires .5 summoned bosses. 
---
Trinket: 
---
* Draconic: Phase 5. 
---
Weapon: 
---
While the Mace is availabe. It is probably not BIS because there probably won't be a healer enchant to put on a 1H Mace. You are likely better off with the BRD or UBRS Staff so you can put the Intellect enchant on it. 
---
Offhand he recommends is also part of .5 bosses. 
---
There are other issues... such as many of these items being hard to obtain affixes or drop from rare spawns. Even if the items exist there are arguable better options. Why are these items in particular the best? I'm not sure the creator can even answer that. What if someone chooses moonglow or HOTW spec? 
---
I would ask Blocrak to update his guide.
---
Wouldn't paying one way mean that they needed to pay you to spec back after you specced away for personal reasons...? Not really different...
---
they stack
---
Think I would have spent the money on another monitor and desk
---
I will be impressed if they do. But I do not think they will. I think there will be a lot of wiping and a lot of warrior players confused about how they are not on top of the damage meters. But we will see.
---
All you need is to do a few dungeons and you’ll scoop up a nice slow 2hander. Using rank 2 SoC isn’t bad at all btw , it’s the same proc dmg as max rank. As for judgement it doesn’t much dmg without crit or spellpower so your not missing out on much there.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OvpzForHyU
---
True with the breaks, and yeah the consecrate / ae is very appealing :)
---
Clean your keyboard it's filthy
---
Why do they care if you spec back if they need you as something else?
---
I mean it all comes down to preference. 
---
That is always how my guilds have done it. When I did and did not have a say.
---
Two poster frames and some printing from Costco is not going to buy a desk let alone a monitor.
---
Non-human furys don't need maladath since it can only get them to +4 swords meaning you need edgemasters regardless. Edgemasters and Maladath gets you to +11 which is overkill since glancing cap is +8.
---
Go to classicmapz.xyz/sandbox/ and it’ll show you.
---
Druids are the obvious one. They suck at basically everything except the tools they have to support.
---
Any tips? I've never done it but I know he drops  nice dagger and I'll be spending a lot of time in BRD solo. I know it's a warlock type caster, so I'm guessing Shadow protection potions?
---
I always understood "stance dancing" as knowing when to change stance, and to what other stance, to utilize all of your abilities to their fullest potential in a variable(PvP) setting.
---
Maybe I've been giving people too much credit.
---
At that point, it's more like 10 talent points, but sure.
---
If you're willing to help the paladins out and spend 50 gold every time they need to respec in order to be able to actually survive in the open world or to be able to heal to your 100%, no margin for error expectations, then sure, go right ahead and help make them the best healers you could ever want. Otherwise, just stop gatekeeping healers. It's not like you're going to bother speccing as one, and if, after kicking out the holy paladins in your guild that are clearly just wanting to leech your precious Mageblade away, you're wanting to search for a long time  to find not only a healer at all, but also a healer that meets your exact specifications, then I wish you the best of luck.

Wow.....
---
That is awesome man.
---
Imagine if professions didn't have level requirements, you could literally be just a level 1 "Human Tailor".
---
My point is that there are always going to be BiS lists that people are going to go off of.  Sure, raiding MC you weren't sitting there with Naxx loot tables.  But the vast majority of players weren't at the top tier of raids, so they knew what was likely +1 tier above what they were clearing.
---
I like OT bear because they don’t compete with many folks for loot, bring brez, crit buff, and innervate.
---
&gt; And in WoW Classic, 99% of the game is not about powergamming and min/maxing.
---
...uh, yes it is. The nature of the game(instanced dungeons/raids, open world PvP) **enforces** it.
---
Isn't this exactly the reason why most questions are from powergaming/minmaxing perspective? How self-deluded do you have to be to use a direct counter to your point as the basis of your point?
---
Close, but not quite what I’m looking for!
---
My point is that as far as actual changes go there are bigger fish to fry. It really isn't that big of a deal. Yea in a perfect world it would stay but people can't keep it in their pants and people spamming it shits chat up. If moderating chat is SJW then well your lot has jumped the shark long ago if that's what it's come too. Sorry you won't get to make lame jokes that break ToS with the weapon anymore. Vote with your wallet and don't sub to classic if you feel that strongly about it.
---
I believe that is my plan moving forward. Just have to convince my wife that the WoW wall might be a little...extra than she thought. lol
---
Thanks for that anecdote.  Maybe Holy will be fine for raids.  I guess I’ll never know until I try.
---
Add to this, in any sort half serious guild most of the aoe tanking is just rotating aoe taunts on all the warriors and kiting while other classes nuke them down with oe before taunt falls off.
---
I mean, power is capped in WoW, it always is and will be by the gear available. If you have your BiS and another person of the same class also has BiS, you aren't any less powerful. They are just equally as strong. 
---
If you are on a forum discussing an MMO, you are more invested in the game than a vast majority of players. So even if there are millions of players, only a small percentage of them are saying they want to be the most powerful.
---
It’s going to be incredibly awkward running a melee and a ranged.
---
This will turn into a huge point of contention for players as time goes on. I've dealt with this in another progression server game I play and it gets worse than EU vs. NA. One club is the hardcore and decent playtime crowd who want 3 month unlocks, the other wants to play 30 minutes a day and have 6+ month unlocks. The low playtime crowd was dubbed "Karate Dads" because they were so busy taking all of their vegan children to all of their karate classes, taking the bus, and making it back in time for their essential oils classes that they couldn't possible keep up with 6 month unlocks.
---
3 months is a long time, and without content updates people will get bored quick. The hardcore folks will be raidlogging by week 6.
---
Naw, don't worry. This is just the 5th post about this in. The past week.
---
Cannot upvote for obvious reasons... LOK TAR OGAR
---
Did you quit your job?
---
If you are the imp warlock in a raid it means you are 30/0/21 therefore no improved hs/imp. But 5-man sure have fun!
---
Play what you want to play. Unless you care about hardcore PvP any race is fine. Escape artist is nice for rogues, but nice enough to hate your character?
---
I’m thinking the same with mage warrior or mage druid. I’m trying to figure out if I can easily do 2 roles in dungeons and what my keybinds will be.

Fuck the racials and statistics. Play what's fun for you if you love it! It's not like you wont get invited to groups or raids.

I'll be buying lots of gold, fyi
---
play what you want
---
If they're the raid/guild leader, of course they get to decide who is what class. It'a their raid/guild. If you want to pick and choose who's what, you are more than capable of starting your own guild.

Not ideal but it works lmao

I will say it underplayed on Alliance at least.

You'll be forced into playing Daggers.

Human rogue gets Sword skill, but they have no advantage for Dagger spec.
---
Everyone can get Core Leather Gloves
---
I've had that thought before, I thought it would have been better to give some paladin equivalent class to horde, and some shaman equivalent class to alliance .
---
My thought was it was weird that spell breakers are missing despite being the most iconic of blood elf units from WC3.  I thought they could have used spell breakers in place of paladins.  It would be easy to see them with magic buffs like blessings, a cleanse, a magic immunity shield, heavy armor, and a shield.  The way paladins are kinda battle-priest, a spell breaker is kinda a battle-mage.  Then all you are missing is to add heals to them, but that would be easy to do lore wise with Blood Elf society being remade to combat the scourge, would be reasonable for your front line units to pick up anti-undead spells and heals to try and curb the plague.  Hell maybe even have a human paladin that was still honoring the human-elf alliance as a character teaching paladin spells to spell breakers, and elves adapting them to their own native magic. 
---
My thought for alliance replacement for shaman would have been something thematically related to Velen, and ideally with some tie in to existing lore from the Broken Draenei from WC3.  Something maybe called Seer, Prophet, or even Harbringer.  Maybe even tie them to original horde shamans via shamans having far sight, and Velen being a prophet and maybe having some sort of future sight.  At the same emphasizing the cultural difference.  Maybe make draenei shamans a more of a technological elements user.  Whereas horde shaman are very earth, and dust. and prayer, maybe draenei would use some crystalline pylon based technology to bring balance to the elements in able to call on their power, instead of merely just giving them totems and calling it the same shit.  
---
This would also allow the expansion of those classes to other races without having really dumb lore.  I still have no clue why there are dwarf shaman, but you could easily see gnomes taking an interest in draenei tech and creating them own gnomish version.  Or for spell breakers on horde, since there would be no holy magic involved it would be easy to see Blood Elf spell breakers teaching forsaken or maybe even troll mages how to be spellbreakers to better combat the scourage.

How do I check results ?
---
It's on the wrong faction, you should go Orc
---
&gt; being resistant to learning
---
You being ignorant of what a metonymy is does not equate to other users being resistant to learning. Neither does you being overly pedantic over a widely-accepted term.
---
You don't hope for "random-number-generator" loot, you hope you get lucky with the RNG that dictates what item will drop.
---
You don't invite "damage-per-second" to your group, you invite the people that dish out the "damage-per-second".
---
You don't drink the actual glass, you drink its contents; the water inside of it.
---
Gotta love when people argue from ignorance.
---
Looks real nice, are you gonna change the UI size?
---
CRG9 ? Or the older one ?
---
I didnt choose the answer because I want it to be that way. The question is asking what it will be. I'm just answering what I think will be the case.
---
HAHAHAHA i just noticed that!
---
On the last page, add an option for nothing will happen.  As a cynic this is what I think.
---
Is there a source out there for how WoW netcode works?  Overwatch has a really cool YouTube video on how theirs works, and it's fundamentally opposite of what you're describing (the client is authoritative generally), though obviously they're completely different styles of games.
---
Play what you find fun.  You may end up having a harder time finding groups in hardcore raids, but that's about it.  Not everyone is so picky for regulars/casuals.  In pvp, no one is going to care much if you can pull your weight even a little bit.
---
Jesus that POV gives me nausea. I couldn’t play with a monitor *that* wide.
---
Yeah the 1440p variant
---
Yep. Gotta pump those brakes sometimes.
---
Yeah gonna change it, not sub to the game yet
---
If people have managed for 15 years with this mechanic, I'm sure you will too.

I made this one it was a grasp of what i listened to when i was 12/13 start of tbc i guess
---
Nah man, from 1 to 59 you get to live the fantasy of being a holy warrior, smiting down those that are evil and horrific.
---
When you ding level 60 and have to put on a dress, paladins become the greatest meme of all. They're still great healers...but that darn dress though...
---
Looks amazing ! Classic can’t come soon enough haha
---
Someone who doesn’t need a multi-monitor setup? I don’t use more than one.
---
If someone is fighting next to the node, don't be an ass and ninja the node/chest next to the guy! Go for the next node/chest. It's not that hard!
---
Sorry
---
Go ahead, weapon skill matters a lot less for rogues than it does for warriors. You get 305 skill and 5% hit from talents in the combat tree already, and you can cap out the glancing blow damage reduction on your melee hits if you use Maladath/The Hungering Cold. It won't be an issue in PVE, and you can always just use daggers also.
---
For PVP, escape artist and stoneform are pretty nice, but it doesn't matter unless you plan on being extremely hardcore for PVP. Just play the race you want. Skill matters a lot more than your race (unless you're an orc and just win a rogue/rogue matchup because you resist a stun, but that's another story).
---
Well it might make the decision between Undead and Orc easier. Horde this time since I was Alliance way back in 2005.
---
One thing he forgot to mention that goes for all managerial roles, is dish out all and any other responsibilities to others.
---
A guild leader needs to focus on "the big picture", organizing events, or figuring out the raid schedule and goals. You don't have time to be leading your guild recruiting, class leaders, PvP leader (both world of BG organized), controlling your guild bank, managing the loot council... Etc.
---
Gives those " high-ranking" roles to other people. Just because you are the guild leader does not mean you also have to be the raid leader too. If someone knows all the pve raids and boss fights better and can lead your pve raid better, let them. Act like the CEO, and manage your executive staff and their respective departments. You are not super man able to spend 18 hours a day managing people and guild assets and resources.
---
To anyone reading this: It's complete bullshit. Leeway is coded IN the client, and can be seen in the 1.12 client that pservers use as demonstrated [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8eg81/to_all_of_those_who_claim_melee_leeway_wasnt_in/)
---
Cool, the first class I was use to be rogue alliance
---
This is why I put all my drinks in a secure cup holder in front of the keyboard.
---
&gt; Okay, so from my understanding Night Elf is probably the **MOST AWESOME** race to choose for Rogue on Alliance in Vanilla. The increased stealth and lesser vanish is nice and all but I still feel like the other races are garbage. HOWEVER, I love Night Elves a lot. They are my favorite race in the game. I love their capital city, starting zone, lore, and other night elvish zones throughout the game. Anyways, what I was wanting feedback on was whether I should just play what's going to be the most fun for me in classic or try some sub-par racials and just play what is going to gimp me the most? I plan on doing a fair amount of both PvP and PvE. Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks guys!
---
Whats the full name of that screen? Ive been thinking about getting something like that aswell
---
Its him, Peter parker!
---
Perhaps but look in the vanilla book that came with the game. Shamans are the "jack-of-all-trades". :)
---
The „looking for dps“ thing is stupid and also a saying I don’t like - that‘s why I’d be looking for „damage dealers“ or „dd“. Drinking a glass of water is actually common though - in contrast to rng. No ignorance from my side.
---
They will more than likely do something 'classic' influenced in the next expansion. But it will be superficial and won't deviate from where the core of retail has ended up. (Because hate is as much as you do, there's a reason it's the way it is, and that's because it caters to the majority).
---
Wow, I was unaware of that multishot interaction... That is pretty scuffed. And another one to add to hunter issues list
---
DEL-A-GATE. get COMPETENT class leads to whip your raiders in to shape. Also, Have a code of honor and stick to it, no one likes a wishy washy.
---
And from my experience the standard is to have 40 people and maybe be a few short and pug 1-2. If you want 40 raiders your going to have to keep some kind of bench though as half the time 43 people show up
---
I suppose, but I'm just using the second account for downtime stuff, farming - so I was thinking warlock can easily farm Tyrs hand, ungoro elites while the paladin would be used for 2 manning dungeons with my mage main (not that the mage would need a 2nd to aoe farm the lower dungeons)
---
That's why I'm torn =P
---
Which are you looking at? I’m on mage, warrior, shaman, or priest.
---
Really isn’t that bad
---
I'm ever an optimist and think they are delaying it so that they can make vast improvements to Layering.
---
No, you misunderstand, not only is it unfun for me, it’s unfun for anybody. This phenomenon is well documented.
---
Selfish people aren't the ones who want need everything. The people who want it are the ones who wouldn't be rolling need to ninja with a different system
---
I think naxx can be done on day one. It has been done on pservers and I don't think classic will be so vastly different from pservers that its not possible.
---
&gt; /rnd is the shortest slash command to generate a random number.
---
And where 99% of the people use /roll. Nobody uses RNG for /roll.
---
&gt; even urban dictionary does not have an entry for the way people here use rng
---
The second entry is literally what is being used in this thread. Luck.
---
&gt; how the term is used in a wrong way
---
You don't get to dictate whether common usage is wrong or not. That's not how it works.
---
They have like double the hp and tons more armour. They do get crit more but they aren't as spikey as you guys are suggesting. They're mostly hard on healer mana, but if you have enough healers that's rarely a problem.
---
They are a MT, they have a huge hp pool which is fairly safe.
---
The relation of threat cap, TTK, and healers' Mana has nothing to do with private servers versus vanilla. It's a basic MMO concept.
---
For the Horde!!
---
Old Orgrimmar the best Orgrimmar.
---
yea, itll be interesting to see, i can see frost gear being the main hurdle though. even if people cobble together enough green FrR gear thats a lot of gimped and tired 60s limping into the 2 hardest fights in the game
---
When you pick a class &amp; join a guild, you should know what you are getting yourself into. If the guild dictates that in order to Raid you need to be X spec, then you are responsible for doing so. If you don't like that, find another guild. Simple as that. 
---
Do you think Guilds are going to pay for respecs for the people that are ranking up in-between Raids?
---
It really is though. If you have enough healers most fights are limited by dps not healer mana.
---
You can swap weapons mid fight can you not? Or does the buff drop if you swap.
---
All Horde Rogues are equally good and all Alliance Rogues are equally bad so don't worry about it
---
It drops as soon as you swap.
---
I miss NZ.
---
Why waste resources in planning for the unknown? They have dealt with all this before so it's not like they have to develop some crazy tech to deal with it if it happens.
---
Someone has never played Alliance.
---
Add removal of 2 or 3 raid difficulties and removal of time constraint to complete the base requirement for m+ keys... and I might barely be starting to be tempted :)
---
Then yeah they can't use it.
---
You don't really need any talents for leveling.

One monitor omegalul

Oh and bring back my lock's life tap please and their Legion damage portal skill. Aka, make classes fun again.
---
A used smaller monitor? Sure it will.
---
Shadow is not “really bad in end game.” We had a shadow priest that consistently was top 5 dps on single target fights, on multi target fights he was middle of the pack with the hunters. Not to mention the off heals and resurrections. Lastly, as long as you don’t die and stand in stuff, you’re great. 
---
Just because you’re not always topping charts means nothing; dead DPS is 0 DPS.
---
You’re also a monster in PvP.
---
Boomkin on the other hand, would not recommend.....
---
Enjoy classic, I know I will
---
Nothing beats the ingame soundtrack, wow's is one of the all time greats.
---
The /sit thing did work during vanilla though because of spell batching. If you did it quickly enough the hit would crit you because you were sitting down but it would register after you stand up again and so the server would think you were standing up when you got crit. So imo it should work on Classic.
---
Not a healer, so don't know what was possible with the UI. 
---
You could make macros that automatically used the best heal depending on how much health a target had left. Don't think that is possible any more.
---
Having enemy controlled leeway rather than self-controlled leeway is worse though.
---
If I move while using frost nova, it will always be (at base) 12 yards of range - doesn't matter if anyone else is moving there is a consistent range that i can rely on.
---
But for melee this is not true- combine the fact that both targets need to be moving to trigger it with the slow server tickrate, and it means you can sometimes spam strafe and not trigger leeway because the server could check the movement state in between the strafes.
---
That's not hyperbole- that's legitimately how it works- IMO everyone should have the same, self controlled leeway.
---
The Gnome Racial scales with total INT, not to mention escape artist is better than perception in general, and +15 engie is better than the rep talent because most reps you get exalted with you keep doing the content anyway. Once you are exalted the rep talent is dead. (Engie talent is dead if you arent engie, and once its 300 to)
---
But man, you group with a good hunter and it shows. Especially if you have a bad tank - I've seen a good hunter take care of three dungeon mobs while that warrior did whatever he was doing. Trap one, pet tanks one, kited the other
---
Only for PvP where a lot of the T1 and T2 is good for warlocks.
---
Damn homie
---
So? It's still an upgrade and the player does that dungeon to upgrade his/her gear. If It was me, I'd pass because I'm a naive nice guy. But I don't expect others to do so and sometimes I regret doing it.
---
It really is
---
Seriously, he's a toxic piece of shit and he's dumb as a brick wall. Let's all just forget about him and move on.
---
People won't go for Full T0 in Vanilla. You will see lots of tryhards - like Warriors in Leather and Pallies in Cloth.

It seems that AOE grinding will be something more opportunistic and not a fast and reliable way to go.
---
Dungeon grinding on the other hand sounds very good.
---
And that's why you don't listen to that fraudster.
---
It the Logitech G403 :)
---
Just play dagger spec. You’ll do more dps and there’s no competition for daggers. 
---
Shadowmeld is not a lesser vanish though because you can’t use it while in combat. Shadowmeld is actually worthless for rogues.
---
He's been right about everything so far, and will continue to be right
---
Take my money I want one
---
Google Spreadsheets.
---
Jed/Arena runs that's about it.
---
not ideal? The desk would be better than that
---
Grizzly hills is the best
---
This makes me wanna find great/popular Classic Warcraft replicas on Etsy.
---
I really wish Etsy had better searching, though. It’d be easier to find shit as great as this, if there were sorting by “best sellers” and “best rated.”
---
Nobody specs holy. You either go shadow for PvP or disc for PvE/PvP healing. 
---
And no they are not very common. On alliance you will probably see more paladins than priests, not sure about horde side.
---
But that's 1% you get back for simply taking a different person.  Lots of people see that equation as a no brainer.
---
Have an alternate activity/levelling area. It's more rare than the memes make out but every once in a while a zone will be too hot if you just want to level/farm. So have a backup plan.
---
If you want to actually try PVP - my best advice is just do it. See someone within +/-3? Go attack them. Seriously. You might win, you might lose, but either way you'll start picking up some skills. When in doubt, CC the other guy (and be ready because they ALWAYS have healing pot)
---
With how universally disliked things like flying mounts are, I find it hard to imagine it'll have zero community requested changes.
---
It's not about selfish it's about equitable.  If person A can equip the item, then person B can sell the item and buy a different item that they can then equip, I see that as 'need' for both.  Unless you agree that everyone will always roll greed, but then you have that one guy that rolls need to ninja it.  So it just makes sense for everyone to need.  If someone really needs it and they lose the roll, they can buy it off the other guy.  Seems fair to me.

Pally buffs &gt; WF.  Melee dps wont even be geared enough early on to make WF shine.

---
hu?
---
mmmm slam spec
---
&gt; and just AQ40 gear isn't going to cut it
---
What will cut it?  Partial naxx gear?
---
Lol the comments here from people who can't take differing opinions should be fun to read.
---
You understand boomkin but not ret? Whats the difference? They both are specs and not classes and both are memes because their dps is dogshit.
---
It's unlikely aoe grinding will be at all effective at launch.  Even one person at a spawn location is enough to mess up rotations, and there's certainly going to be way more than that.
---
And if you have too many healers you don't have enough DPS.
---
Having fun sounds like a pretty potent benefit
---
I'm talking about the 1/3 of the community that need everything even if they can't use it. Something that is worth only a small amount of gold to you them but is actual upgrade for someone there. That's just selfish.
---
Limited Immunity
---
About this much &lt;---&gt;.
---
If it's not your role, then yea, otherwise no because people already have to respec for raids.

On a pvp server solo players can't ignore you, because you can attack them, on a pve server they can just choose tocontinue questing without being pvp flagged.

Stopped reading after this get the hell out of here with this shit
---
Hey i wondered about all of this aswell. 
---
Thanks for the post, i want to play moonkin.
---
And just get points in improved buffs. Get 3/8 tier 1 for that Thorns maxing on the MT all that stuff.
---
But I was wondering about the aura, is it not better to maybe put a moonkin in with the heal group instead of the mages who are so adamant they don’t need it?
---
Or am I missing the point here and is that only good with Paladins ?
---
And pro-Druid tank people constantly banging on about threat isn't what the discussion is about.
---
in a 40 man? not really
---
I haven’t played in 6 years and from what I remember Ret pallies were extremely effective in PVE, even though they were easy to play. Boomkin on the other hand was 10% good kids and the rest looked idiotic and didn’t know how to play.
---
OK so who is the MT?
---
You're stuck in a similar problem to Vanilla. Even if 95% of the playerbase is on board with a change, as soon as you get one, people will be asking for another or arguing about implementation.   
---
    
---
I tend to think TBC:#noflying would be fairly straightforward to do, but it would have a pretty big impact on the game. Dailies, dungeon entrances, economy, raid drops, wpvp would all be significantly affected by any change to how flying mounts work.    
---
If you straight up say *some things in TBC are weird and wacky and people didn't overly like, but we are remaking it 1:1*, then that gives you a clear direction to make the game and release it.
---
Because they are asking you to play a spec you are not focused or geared for, so they should front the cost of returning you 'as you were' after the raid.
---
Overwatch uses interpolation to put people ahead of where they actually are, like most fps games.
---
&gt; First off I kind of frequently read that people claim they had the best time in a game during the initial starting phase, when a lot of things were undiscovered and unknown. There's no "meta", everyone is just doing what he wants and trying things out. 
---
Eh, yes and no.  It was such a shit show, but I was one of those people in vanilla developing spreadsheets.  Once DPS meters came out, people could double check their progress directly to other raid members.  
---
&gt; WoW Classic will be a solved game, so to say. Already we know exactly which talent spec will deal the most damage in combination with a certain race, certain items and a certain rotation. Every boss is known, every strat already developed. For a lot of people who didn't play on pservers Classic will not have the same feeling as vanilla did back then.
---
I'd say yes and no.  Yes, because what we already knew was "meta" in classic.  Then, those things were refined on private servers.  However, a lot of stuff on private servers had some things wrong but new metas came up.  Stuff like end game viable dual wield tanking specs.  Lots of math on proper Druid tanking and viability.  Lots of other stuff like druid DPS with crowd pummeler and power shifting, etc.
---
There are Pserver metas that still need to be tested and double checked, because Pservers were estimating a lot of data.  So there's still a bit that needs to be tested and theorcrafted. 
---
Will it drastically change the established metas?  No.  But there still will be lots of theorycrafting.
---
&gt; And second I think a general difficulty in developing games nowadays is the spread of information. Let's say there's a glitch in WoW (to deal lots of damage or get gold/items whatever). Back then maybe the guy who discovered it, a few selected member of the high-end scene would know about it, and eventually it would get fixed in the next patch. Nowadays you will have a post on reddit within days, if not hours, and tomorrow half the population will abuse it (as seen at the start of BfA when you could loot a world boss multiple times I think? Blizz fixed the bug within 2 days, but still had to ban a noticable amount of people due to abusing it).
---
I'd still say no on something like this.  Case in point the shield spike rep exploit for argent dawn with the Naxx patch.  Found out about that real quick and our guild was sitting in dungeons farming rep all day. Plenty of other stuff like [Hakkar blood plague inciden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoN4nCaULGo)t, [why reckoning was nerfed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xhgvouRprw).  Damn, the WoW forums were a hot spot for people to spill the beans on exploits.
---
What reddit is today is what the WoW forums were back then.  Sure, things are easier now with stuff like Discord/Reddit having larger populations.  But even this sub-reddit only has around 2k people lurking here.  It's far less of a population that was browsing the official wow forums back in the day.
---
&gt; So yeah, bis lists existed during AQ/Naxx. But a) they weren't necessarily correct, and b) not all people knew about it. I mean even today with all those informations readily available I've seen countless people in M+ or mythic raids run the wrong talents.
---
Nothing is even correct about the BiS lists today.   They're also all under the assumption that you'll actually get the BiS gear each phase, which you won't.   I had a whole spreadsheet of every single item that was available in the tier.  I had it put into my DPS simulator spreadsheet that I custom built, each item showed me a % gain in DPS.  I knew which items were downgrades, which were upgrades and which were sidegrades.  I knew there was a margin of error, so basically I never took side grades unless I wanted to try out a different spec.
---
And there were just as much people running wrong/bad talents and gear in vanilla.  I saw a rogue in ironforge that took the tanking trinket from the onyxia head...
---
&gt; And due to all those informations out there I fear that players will be a lot more elitist and close-minded, making classic feel worse. I mean reddit is the best symptom, every opinion that isn't adhering to the general direction of the thread gets downvoted no matter what.
---
So don't join a guild that's going to require you to do this.  Just because there are going to be people leveling up to 60 and killing ragnaros week 1 doesn't have anything to do with your enjoyment of the game.  If you want to go into this blind, you can try to find other players that will do the same.
---
Hell, we were a progression guild, but we were also still looking at videos put out by top raid guilds in order to try and learn the fights and get familiar with them.  We weren't just winging it every single boss in the game and hoping for the best.
---
How often are you limited by the MT's threat?
---
hmm.. i never really thought about it, but yeah marketing is kinda bad.
---
Thanks again. I’ve now updated the starter sets to be all quest items and/or leatherworking purchases, rather than trying to rely on expensive world drops that won’t be initially available.
---
I had a triple monitor setup like this a while back.  The edges of the screen move really fast and it gets super nauseating
---
Play what you want, NE is perfectly viable for end game. Only go human if you care about min/maxing
---
Lock, hunter,  rogue,  druid for me
---
If I join a guild with the understanding that I will be a healing priest, and I am in holy for pve, then it makes sense that I pay for my own respec if I want to play shadow in offtime.  It is my responsibility to make myself effective in the role that I am assigned to in the guild.
---
But if I join a guild with that same understanding, yet they ask me to play shadow, they should definitely cover the cost.  If I am making efforts and commitments to gear and be prepared to raid as a holy priest, the guild should be prepared to cover the cost they are trying to burden me with.
---
Looks amazing, DO MORE!
---
That's the second option you're describing. He's describing the third.
---
Always ish? Depending on the MT's threat you may have to give him at least a few seconds.
---
Some fights are less than 2 minutes long and some of the bottlenecky ones are like super blitzy, having to spend 11 seconds vs 3 seconds on a boss can be a loss of like 10-20% of the time you have to burn him before getting overwhelmed (A portion of the fight is spent dealing with things that aren't the boss), and it's also the time when your raid is at 100% fulls trength.
---
Most fights are not ended because the healers go oom or because the tank died (although with very low gear this may be the case) most fights end because whatever mechanic it is overwhelms your raid and this can be solved by dpsing the boss.
---
Tanks also just generally can't keep up with top dps in a lot of situations. A perfectly played mage/fury warrior can generally out threat the tank, warlocks can easily get threat because they don't have threat reduction abilities.
---
&gt; if anyone doesn't know who this guy is, he is a well known pserver streamer who was rather controversial to some 
---
Most know him as the guy who lost to a level 17 hunter as a 25 druid then cried about the guy potting
---
No he isn't. Nice try.
---
World of Warcraft Starter Edition is the name of the free test up to L20. Been using 4 of those to test out my 5-man setup team.
---
Applied to a guild as a healing druid, met some guy from my country there that was hell bent on playing a warrior. 
---
Decided to roll a holy paladin instead. Make that warrior an unstoppable wrecking ball in the BG's by eliminating the one weakness warriors have : CC (cleanse/blessing of freedoms).
---
Was debating maybe rolling a priest too. Probably the best pvp support class for everything except a warrior (Power infusion/shield/...).
---
Sunday Morning show up in a suit and hand them a brochure with class/race breakdowns, a map, and some sweet raid pics.
---
Warrior, rogue, mage, or priest.
---
I'm still hoping my friend will duo-level his warri with my priest, so I can reduce my options.
---
Agreed. People don't like to be shown they're wrong.
---
He is hated, because he spits out the truth into peoples faces and they mostly cant handle it
---
It's not bad at holding threat, but you have to finesse it a little. For example, send the voidwalker and stop start casting until he's hit the target, and that'll give him more time to generate a relevant amount of threat. Your mileage may vary obviously
---
This sub really underestimated the amount of people who will be playing Classic who do NOT conduct any research on what is BiS/rotations/spec/raid buffs. I’m pretty sure that my friends from Vanilla, who I’ll be playing with, haven’t looked into optimizing their characters and I’m ok with that.
---
You are free to make a meme guild if you want, thats your right. I dont have to inv you to my guild. Thats my right.
---
Play night elf for sure.
---
&gt; Yea that's not happening. Classic launches at 6pm PST on a Thursday.
---
In what universe ? I think you are going to be quite disappointed if you login on thursday. Just saying. So get your facts straight.
---
Yeah, gl with that.
---
Play a healer, simple.
---
I find it interesting that people are predicting Alliance to be the dominant raid progression faction. Alliance was even ahead in the speed running question? Do y'all not know about windfury totem? Blessings are great and all but for speed running especially windfury is king.
---
Not everyone is going to raid, ever. There are ppl that barely can hit L60 and love the game. Others might want to play the game differently how you and me play it.
---
It increases stealth by a tiny bit.
---
I'm sure you're going to be better off farming high lvl herbs/ores as much as possible if you reach 60 very fast and just save them untill theres a higher demand than supply. (Like arcanite bars 2-4 months in when a lot of warriors will try to craft BiS Gear)
---
I’m not saying the particular thing you are talking about isn’t fun. I’m talking about a phenomenon in general.
---
Frostadamus has a couple of videos on this. [Bats in the Plaguelands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh3fUKhN91Q&amp;t=1s) drop a ton of vendor trash, but this has yet to be confirmed on Classic since Frost is using private servers. Otherwise, [Basilisks in STV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTTwQCnHndw&amp;list=PL9AmYHubEvRouUnbQnX1rR0eO_8zelUbu&amp;index=8&amp;t=0s) are also an option. Jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows had previously looked like a great vendor trash farm too, but private servers got the drop tables wrong, as was confirmed by some Alakazam archive searching. 
---
If you want cloth, the Ogres in Deadwind Pass look like being a good option that should remain the same for Classic, as people used to farm them back in vanilla.
---
I prefer [The Warlock Den](http://www.wowmb.net/) over discord. No changes! :-)
---
This is an extremely specific survey.
---
It's not worth grinding on mobs above your level. My experience from beta was that mobs as little as 1 above your level were an incredible step-up in time to kill, between the increased hp, resistances and other defenses it jus took way longer.
---
* Will you be playing, either primarily or occasionally, as an off-spec for your class?  
---
Yeah, definetly swapping between fury prot and arms
---
* Do off-specs have a place in raiding?  
---
if they are required for a fight, or if a key class is missing, and you can fill it adequately.
---
* Do off-specs have a place in PVP, solo-leveling, or 5-man dungeons?  
---
this is where most offspecs do best, rarely will the best raid spec, be the best dungeon or pvp spec.
---
* Is Classic flexible in terms of whether or not off-specs can be successful?  
---
not very, the 50gold talent change price is rather steep, so it has to be an investment to switch specs.
---
* Do you have a favorite off-spec?  
---
Arms definetly, pvp king :D
---
* Are people worrying too much about off-specs, and just need to mind their own/their guild's own business?  
---
maybe? offspecs are fine aslong as you dont force it down anyones throat. Same with being undergeared or unskilled. Be upfront about your intentions and people will accept or decline, knowing what they signed up for.
---
* Please share your own thoughts, but feel free to use the above ideas as starting points of discussion  
---
My main concern with offspecs will be losing awesome pvp gear to meme specs, if i have to put in the work and make a super expensive boe fury spec to perform in raids. I shouldn't have to give up my chance at a cool 2h for a ret paladin who should be swinging a magic debuff axe instead. Abusing their meme position to get prio on pvp items.
---
Hunter’s deadzone was removed in Cataclysm, not in BC ....The fact this comment is getting upvoted just convinced me that there are many Hunter fanboys roaming around and expecting everybody to tell them that their class is super hard to feel good about it.
---
I’m also sorry, but getting deadzoned by a Priest or a Lock is almost impossible unless the hunter does really not know what he’s doing. Without roots/slows, a class shouldn’t be able to spend time in your deadzone. It’s true about Frost Shock spamming shaman though, I just don’t think of them often because I play Horde.
---
Thinking that you can simply get away with Travel form and restealth as a Druid is very simplistic. It just sound nice in paper, in reality in travel form you’re so vulnerable it’ can be very hard against most classes without top notch gear. Mages and rogues won’t reset fights easily with a pet on them. Outside of all the tools I mentioned before you also have Viper Sting, which makes it hard for mages to make the fight last anyway even with Evocation’s CD up
---
Saying that you can easily get killed by Lock’s DoTs doesn’t bring anything to the discussion, because it’s not Hunter specific. All classes get hammered by Warlocks in PvP past certain gear levels, safe maybe for Paladins. Warlock DoTs are completely OP in Vanilla and BC.
---
That's not the point I was making... you misunderstood the context. 
---
I'm saying if he refuses to tank anymore and wants to stay as dps, then it **could** be taken as he doesn't want to help the guild. This is the message I sent up top.
---
1.13 is the current beta version. There was no patch 1.13 in vanilla.
---
It’s all utility I don’t care is my lock is doing ANY damage I care if curse of elements is on the mob and his banishes up and healers are soul stoned
---
You're not my guildie, buddy!
---
The spec back is optional, right?
---
If you deem it necessary to spec back.. that's kinda on you. 
---
like I said prior.. kinda a conversation to be had on expectations and what not.
---
Opinions dude. We all have them.
---
1.13 wasn't vanilla. 1.13 is classic wow.
---
I don't know if I should feel bad or
---
Janky broken wierd cheesy shit. You can do so much of it with paladins its ridiculous.
---
Fell in love with them when I first started ignoring mecanics with bubbles.
---
I went big.  Just in love with the size of the monitor, as I can sit back and see so much.
---
WidePeepoHappy
---
Maybe i worded this incorrectly. My point was most of this assumes druid MCP most all feral druids will rarely farm them.  Thus i was attempting to insinuate this.
---
Seems pretty hungry for attention for someone who doesn't care about it
---
This is assuming cloth is cheap and is not all bought up in the blink of an eye and gets really expensive haha
---
Warlock would do very well, but you'll be competing for gear.
---
You need a square monitor for classic.
---
Hey ! I want to buy this type of screen exactly :)
---
Can you link it please ?
---
very cool! would love that :o
---
I guess you love being hated, I feel sorry for you
---
&gt; Abusing their meme position to get prio on pvp items.
---
Getting items good for their pve dmg over you getting those items for pvp. That's total abuse of their position. It's not like option 1 helps the raid and option 2 doesn't.
---
Don't do it if you don't like to help people with personal problems. That's my tip. People will talk to you, trust you and you will act as their online friend and therapist. 
---
Some player might concider you their only true friend.
---
Yes, seriously. And it's quite a weight to hold up. Keep that in mind.
---
I think the reason he is questioning you is because it has been proven that for the progression through classic the bear tank was not only viable, but often better than the warrior tank (specifically with the Dire Bear buff at 1.02. I think it was 1.02). This really changed around AQ due to gearing. Tanking MC with MC BIS gear should show nearly identical damage taken with druids doing more threat. This trend is true until AQ40 when warriors take off. By the time Naxx ends with Naxx BIS items on both it is a night and day difference. Warriors are clearly the superior tank taking far less damage.
---
So, the questions are valid. Unless you healed Naxx BIS geared warrior &amp; druid through MC, what you are saying doesn't make sense. Even with 1.12 talents being applied, due to gearing, the druid tank should be equal in damage taken up until about AQ40 gear is available.
---
Of course there are always fights where the bear is best and fights where the warrior is best.
---
You are correct that at Naxx level gear the warrior is by FAR the superior tank. But they are not that different with MC gear.
---
If I were you I would definitely go for a gathering profession, more specifically herbalism. I must admit I am biased as herbalism made me a ton of gold back in the day and I was able to help the guild with providing mats for flask of the titans. It really is a profession that becomes more and more profitable as the server progresses into harder content.
---
Why wouldn’t this work? Did people get less xp if higher level players kill the mobs you tag on the beta?
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
No, engi is so good for hunters and you need mining to support it. But you don't need to only use track minerals; switch between them for situational awareness
---
I did for a while. I was a Dreams/Glory King (just under about 2/3rds of my active time) before the new servers and client updates.
---
They are miles apart. You will be pleased. You can't buy anything but subtime.
---
You can only earn and but things with ingame currency/effort.
---
How can you kill anything when you're stun locked?
---
iono
---
I’m really just bemused that you can label me as socially awkward from just 1 joke, be it good or bad. 
---
How about this, you persistently trying to correct me over a lameass joke is just showing how pretentious and ‘know-it-all” you are, and let me educate you that not everyone appreciates this kind of behavior.
---
Seriously... work themselves to go forward? Who do you think you are?
---
I haven't been in the beta but according to ppl in this video it doesn't seem to work. 
---
https://youtu.be/7p988Bsy7PE
---
If I haven't misunderstood you get xp according to % hp you dmg the mob.
---
Wich makes 60 mob grinding (in dungeons) useless.
---
I mean the theory is I hit 60 fast enough that little to no one has methods available to them to keep up with what I could pay for the cloth.
---
Oh good you responded, wouldn't want you banned for 'trolling'
---
Same question but robe of the void and warlocks?
---
I am going to play a HotW Druid. So i am actually capeabele of raidhealing and tanking aswell as worldpvp/pvp in phase 1-2 all in one spec. After that i might go resto or full feral depending on the guild situation. Good thing people cant inspect talents.
---
In a rogue vs rogue situation you never know who is gonna get the opener. Not to mention it's very possible to flip openers on your opponent.
---
They've addressed all of these, except I guess gold sellers because they'll just approach it like they approach it in retail.
---
There's a whole layering technology added for server health that has been discussed to death. Literally thousands of posts, maybe milions if you include all forums.
---
Power leveling might save you a little bit of time but I doubt your friend will want to stick with you for 150 hours. That's a couple months either way.
---
Blasphemous. I for one will be rocking good old 4:3 LCD monitor for my classic experience.
---
.
---
No, I'm not being a snob, it's just I actually never upgraded my monitor since 2007, because I don't want to spend extra while this LCD dinosaur is working perfectly :DDD
---
Well he already predicted some shady things back in the days which come out to be true in the end. :D
---
I was thinking of multibox /power level my own characters.
---

what about rogues? heh heh hehhh
---
I would like to think it’s worth it as we will need it for bloodvine anyway?
---
Also it’s just fun to level with!
---
Lock Lock Lock.
---
Both can aoe while mage keeps them slow.
---
Then u create a meme spec character and realize u werent ready afterall!
---
Original WoW didn't become a phenomenon through marketing, it grew through word of mouth. That's just the way Blizzard operates. Most of their major successes built their success on being great games that drew people in, not by pushing it down peoples throat.
---
And it makes even less sense for Classic to do so. This isn't a product that's meant to draw in the mainstream market, it's a product specifically made for the fans. And most fans either already know about it coming out, or will learn about it from their friends.
---
If Classic is the amazing game everyone around here believes it is what makes people think it needs heavy marketing and won't be able to draw people in through word of mouth yet again ?
---
Oh, so it is/was a exploit? (against rules) they need to clarify this. 
---
Aight, great! I guess I'll have to do that instead then. 
---
Is there any limit on level differences? 
---
For example, I might as well run with my lvl 1 to a lvl 58+ area and let my 60 kill mobs there. 
---
Wouldn't that yield massive xp?
---
Damn bro
---
On a fresh server who is gonna power level you? 🧐
---
Disgusting shill is what you are. 
---
Private server players are well aware that they played with leeway.
---
Theyre pointing out that leeway on private server feels closer to how it Was on retail, than the way blizzard implemented it on the bfa-classic wow client. There has been numerous vids showing pvp examples from RETAIL 2005-7 where you can clearly see the difference. But you kids will Rather bash others than understand what is being said to you.
---
Not hard at all, mostly beacuse the game was made for casuals
---
We have a form in our guild with about 90 signups for classic, and priest is currently our most picked class.
---
New client made to look and feel as close to original client as much as possible and new server with the same approach. All anti-exploit tech in new client will be there under the hood for example.
---
Mobs needs to be in your level range, else you get less xp.
---
lol crazy
---
If caster and with a talent that has +spell type hit (less chance to resist) then equal level are your best bets (even +1 only lose a bit of crit verse).
---
It will slow you down. When I see people dual boxing I gank them. 
---
It's a long process, you need to enjoy the 150-250 hours it takes. It's also the best part of the game and end-game content is very slim. There's no point in rushing it.
---
about what?
---
Sure, but the screenshot shows a UI seemingly without add-ons, and in Classic some UI elements were not moveable.
---
I love my warrior because its not a meme and im actualy meaningfull, instead of being carried.
---
I’m here to progress a second time through the content st a comfortable pace raiding 1-2 nights a week. Despite my experience, I’d prefer to find a group of relative vanilla newbies, then just shut up.
---
I wanna see my guild learn their classes, progress in raids and master fights. If we roll in with a mix of 58s,70s in prehistoric and all in between to mc and it takes us the better part of two nights, all the better (so long as we get better with time).
---
I just want people who don’t stand in fire who are willing to read a class guide. 
---
If I wanted to min max hard, I’d be on bfa. Classic—for me is the relationships and process, the immersion.
---
Yes, but it doesn't stop you permanently. Again the tank randomly getting gibed is more of a wraith thing, as is the healers going oom. More likely other non tank people are dying.
---
Well fuck that, I'm still rolling hunter.
---
Id say they ask the same questions because they are bored. Of waiting. Nothing else to do than prepare and complain about feature X.
---
Why didnt you google it?
---
I highly doubt that they would go intentionally making changes to the vendor prices of items without mentioning it.
---
On alliance plenty of room, no real shortages as most people who want to heal are going to roll this or paladin.
---
On horde over populated a bit. You need a ton of Resto Shamans and they push out Priests a bit. Still great healers, most loved 5 man healer on horde.
---
Nothing is stopping them from goung same route everyone else does. Join/make a guild and start raiding tier by tier. There is no brick wall.
---
If you can get ahead of the pack, especially with layering, you could probably aoe grind without too much problem.
---
Hey!
---
Yeah, I know how you guys did it and you still got my respect after all these years :P
---
It's always funny to talk to people who are 60 and complaining about a rep grind or item drop etc. and then I explain to them about getting the medicine pouch, AGM, fishing gear and Bishops epic trinket on level 19 characters haha.
---
The twink community was so good on bg9. The full 10 vs 10 wsg twink matches were so good and hanging out in Bishops Ventrillo server for bg9 was awesome!
---
100% Holy isn't bad at all for leveling. the issue people have is they play holy like a mage (smite spam) don't do that play it like a shadow priest except you use a smite or two instead of a mind flay.
---
I'll level one main first to 60,then use that to level my other characters.
---
No, it's in the comments. Further down, by several people.
---
What is your fav. movie?
---
welp in classic you will be able to move them, in VANILLA you couldn't you needed an addon
---
&gt; Its not 100% stun resist. It’s doable
---
[lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0)
---
They can do the same to you and have better stun resist, you're at a disadvantage plain and simple.
---
They do not offer much damage, utility, or healing to the raid.
---
When (eventually) all the gear is released being able to stack +stealth (night elf racial, enchants, darkmantle boots) does make quite a big difference in whether a horde Rogue (cats-eye-goggles) or a Feral Druid will pick you up before you spot them. Of course if you were human you could just perception and always find them first but those are the sort of trade-offs where it does make a tangible difference.
---
***
---
There is always going to be a scenario where 'x' option is better (or worse) than 'y'. As long as you recognise these and accept the trade-off you'll be fine.
---
Oh, well then I misunderstood you. But yeah, that is kind of reserving. Honestly I'm not even fully against that, as long as everyone agrees. I mean, if someone makes a group them are allowed to make the rules, and other people can get benefits too. If you don't need the reserved item you might get less competition for the rest of the loot.
---
Layering/Sharding/Whatever is only intended to deal with the population problems in the first few weeks of release. It's unclear what the long-term plans are.
---
Not much I think. Maybe get some more real RPG elements back instead of focusing on ilvl.
---
But they will see that seperating Classic and Retail is a good idea, because they'll make there's a WoW for everyone and more people will subscribe.
---
What if 95% leave?
---
Yeah that's what I thought too. And I am not really afraid of mages hence the shadow resist focus. But SR pot seems a good alternative to gearing for warlocks and SP encounters !
---
:D
---
Yeah I healed savage on a controller and it was fine.
---
It’s based on the new client but requires it’s own install and classic only addons. The next stress test was cancelled indefinitely. So yeah, you can host your own server to set addons up but I’d recommend just waiting.
---
Like I said before, the stun resist IS NICE but I've beaten Orcs many times before regardless of missing a stun. I've also fought them without missing a single stun on many occasions as well. I dont know why you're so rattled about me playing the faction I prefer but spewing your 1550 skill capped logic isnt going to change my mind.
---
Why would warlocks cry about bag space? They have soul bags, the same way hunters have quivers.
---
I already mentioned that things should be discussed pre-run - that has been my whole point in this thread. Talk about it and agree = fair. Don't talk about it = grey area due to everyone having their own rules.
---
&gt;People always complain about people wasting their time in this game. 
---
Of course we do, most of us don't have that much time for gaming, so we don't want to spend the time we have running a dungeon with constant fights between players and ninja looting. We want a fair loot system and new friends. This is, again, why I advocate always to talk about loot first. Problem is people often don't do it because they think the rules are "obvious". Then 5 people all bring their own rules and clash and it *is* wasting everyones time.
---
&gt; I dont know why you're so rattled about me playing the faction I prefer
---
Yeah, I disagree that means I'm rattled af.
---
&gt;  but spewing your 1550 skill capped logic
---
And he called me rattled lol. You're projecting so hard
---
You realize that warlock t2 belt is identical to mana igniting cord right? Mana igniting isn't even on the drop table until p2 at earliest, incredibly foolish to give to warlocks since tier rains from the sky.
---
Same but it makes me extra weary about layering. What if the game is more popular than anticipated and they can't get rid of layering by phase 2 because of it?
---
Take them to Gnomeregan. See what they do with their pet.

that's too wide imo

1440p is my preference. 1080 too grainy imo

My absolute favorite thing to do was to go to gadget, blow all my pet cooldowns and watch it rip horde players apart while I just feigned death on the rooftop and watched the chaos unfold
---
No because they want to retain customers on retail as it makes more money via the cash shop.
---
True, but i think it’s even worse now.
---
Great attention to detail! Those chain links...
---
Oh... that's true haha.
---
Yeah that mp5 is what is op. 
---
Still doubt ill do it. that recipe is gonna be worth thousands to sell.
---
Damn... I’m going to have to deal with a lot of your type when rolling feral huh? *whelp* guess this is just practice
---
Thanks! I was hoping a 20 GB download delaying me on launch day.
---
If the tank is dying, you need to switch to HL. Max rank FoL won't save a dying tank.
---
Big true. The post's own upvotes have spoken. Let us never become /r/wow. It fucking sucks.

What info tells you BFA is the most profitable? As an investor in the final stretch of earnings season I'd love to hear. The only hard info available concerning BFA specifically is that it moved about 3.3 million copies. I would agree with your low sub count assumption but I dont recall blizzard even releasing revenue numbers much less profit numbers on wow.  I have a hard time thinking 12millionx $15(180million/month) is being topped by current numbers, those WotLK numbers would produe 1-2billion dollars a year depending how severe falloff is and lets keep in mind it was huge news when Overwatch broke 1 billion from microtransactions(which revenue has slowed from). If BFA was pulling in that kind of money my ATVI stock would be exceedingly undervalued.
---
Thunder fury is impossible to make until bwl which is phase 3 due to requiring elementium.
---
&gt;you can likely clear mc and bwl with nothing but offspec players
---
The funny part to me is I was in agreement with almost everything you said until that point: I'm nearly certain that a raid of bwl with offspec chars only is straight up impossible.
---
What makes you say MIC won't be until phase 2?
---
An hour or two a week at best? No ones life is that busy, thats simply you deciding to play that little

Feels wrong to give qsr to a hunter as prio, ngl.
---
Wasnt there a post that warriors will be weaker because of some crit calculation?
---
I bet you'll have plenty of healers. by every census i have seen so far we need dps.
---
There was a very interesting clip during Legion from a Method streamer who was answering a question like 'Is it better to farm mythic+ or farm nethershards to increase my ilvl?'
---
The person asking the question had a decent ilvl already and the streamer said bluntly that simply practicing your rotation/positioning is both a better time investment and % increase over increasing your ilevel by a couple of points.

I agree with this despite shilling for enh shamans (if you lack resto shamans).

This is the truth at the end of the day no one wants meme spec, but they may take them as a warm body (good luck getting any loot.)

Darkmoon Fair necklace, Frostwolf ring + dagger, Timbermaw trinket, Warsong wrists &amp; Defiler shoulders if I get that far.

yes
---
Have you sen the scale of the pulls in the video? It's not possible to keep the pulls in the tiny area of a Frost Trap. You need to keep kiting backward through layered blizzards.
---
nah we knew one day our time would come again
---
Hey man, I’m thinking of 24 now too. What model did you get?
---
I have a feeling that most people don't understand the actual issue with pala tanks.
---
Threat is not a problem.
---
Survivability is not a problem.
---
The problem is that you go oom in the blink of an eye, that itemization/gear progression is poor for prot palas, and that you have no taunt.
---
Even in dungeons, you're going to be drinking every pack while your entire party waits for you, and you have no way to control a mob that runs loose.
---
Unlike Feral tanks, which actually have uses, pala tanks are a novelty that are only played for the heck of it, and takes extreme commitment to even work on a basic level as OT in raids.
---
As someone that’s going to be 40 boxing raids I’m going to have a paladin specced deep enough into prot so I can swap to tanking gear to face roll aoe tank because they’re not totally useless sometimes
---
Difference between doing something sweet for your bf/gf and uploading a cringey note to reddit. Don’t get it twisted
---
If you are buff capped you are looking for dps / threat buffs. Too many buffs could push off expensive consumables or important world buffs.
---
You don’t need HoTs to keep everyone alive in that kind of guild. They can help but are not a requirement.
---
It's actually a very low priority for me, we know so much more about the game now than we did in Vanilla and we still cleared raids back  then, with the right guild I believe its just going to be a lot of fun
---
I was thinking of demo shout/roar
---
It has not. 5 Targets is not AE. For AE tanking you use blackguard to get some avoidance as the wepon is irrelvant for AE tanking
---
Fire Nova Totem -&gt; Warstomp -&gt; Lightning Bolt -&gt; Grenade -&gt; Fire Nova explosion - &gt; Chain Lightning -&gt; Earth shock .... Stunlock shaman is the way to go. And I will be able to heal in this same talent build.
---
Transmog tho
---
Cenarion rep + badge farming. Earthstrike, one of the best in slot items can be obtained from that.
---
It is a thing still in classic :p
---
Sorry, but I don't have that option. Are you in beta?
---
Still have poison materials and vanishing powder :( Can't believe they dumbed everything down so much.
---
I remember joining in TBC and probably took like 6 months to hit 70 before wotlk dropped. Absolutely loved the leveling experience and player interactions around that time!
---
If you are not going to engeineering you should really consider to get yourself the argent defender. It is just awesome in mitigating dmg when AE tanking
---
Let me give you a proper answer: there is still a chance we're going to get it. It was never fully stated we are *not* gonna get it, period.
---
does not stack with thorns though
---
So having a weapon that increase your threat by quite a large margin, so you don't have to waste that much mana, doesn't help you with mana issues?
---
Aw I’m sorry you’re right, I was thinking of shooting range when talking about deadzone before too. The area without both melee and ranged attacks was indeed removed in BC.
---
I think we simply won’t agree on these Hunter issues. I played Vanilla Hunter in PvP quite some time, and if we continue bouncing this and there with specific scenarios we’ll never stop. Warlocks who use succubus are the easier ones to kill for hunters anyway, unless they Zerg you in a couple seconds. 
---
In perfect 1v1 scenarios Hunters have more practical tools to deal with their opponents than roughly any classes, save for rogues if their CDs are up. Slows, snares, roots procs, good armor/Health pool, CCs ... no other class has all of these assets. On the other hand they have a deadzone, yeah, but deadzone was a problem to me only with Frost Mages tbh, and generally it’s easier to deal with than say shaking of an angry melee. That’s all my initial post was about. Hunter is more complex than almost all the other classes, but doing mistakes is more forgiving than other classes. For the rest, you can con your way out of almost any situation with skill.

SotC is used when you want to get more proc effects but it only applies to things that don't have some kind of PPM or ICD restriction(eg. nightfall).

Why even reply to a thread with a comment that has nothing to do with the subject?
---
The word means "capable of working successfully". Killing a boss, clearing trash without dying, tanking 5-10 men or even just ZG would be concidered a success.
---
nope
---
I'm planing on killing the Crossroad flight master.
---
Wait a minute. What is the melee hit cap%? And crit does have cap??!
---
This monitor only support 3440x**1080** which is a bit low pixel density in my opinion.
---
and have money
---
Strange
---
&gt; The increased stealth and lesser vanish is nice
---
lesser vanish? i hope you are not confusing shadowmeld with the retail version, in vanilla you cannot use it in combat which is why its rather lackluster for rogues.
---
I don't disagree. I'm not saying it hasn't gotten easier to convince people to agree to a feral tank since vanilla, just that raid viability is mostly limited by community perception of a spec. If the segment of the community that is your guild is cool with you tanking, tank away by all means.
---
so yes.
---
    &lt;Rapid Evolution&gt; OCE - PvP - Committed Casual 
---
**Rapid Evolution** was an original hardcore vanilla PvP and raiding guild on Frostmourne(A) that is making a comeback for Classic WoW, though this time **For The Horde**!. The core of the guild are all vanilla veterans and would love to find some old vanilla friends, though we welcome all that wish to join us.  As 13 years has passed since RE first grinded through the PvP ranks and raid content, we expect Classic to be a little bit more casual and relaxed. We harbour no dreams of server domination but we will be pushing through all that classic has to offer and reliving the vanilla experience.  
---
**Raid Schedule** 
---
We will be raiding 2 nights per week,   Monday and Thursday evening 8pm - 11pm AEST.   As we will only be raiding 2 nights a week we plan to pack as much action with a little downtime as possible so we will expect those that wish to raid to be well prepared and reliable.   
---
**Loot Distribution** 
---
We will be using a combination of EPGP and Loot Council  
---
**Recruitment** 
---
We are welcoming all to join us for Classic WoW - though please note that we have no raid spot availability for Enhancement Shaman, Shadow Priest or Main Tank as these roles have been filled! We would love more primary dps to join us as we continue to fill out our raid roster. As we only have a few select raid positions locked in so far, if you you are active and reliable you will give yourself the best chance of securing a raid spot with us.   While we don't expect to participate in the High Warlord grind this time around, I'm sure many will be PvPing regularly, particularly large scale world PvP!  
---
Come, Join our discord and introduce yourself!  [https://discord.gg/s2ymuX6](https://discord.gg/s2ymuX6)
---
pretty sure there is a cap on +stealth so if you have any combination of +stealth items and the sub talents then it wont benefit you at all, not to mention you have to stand still.
---
trust me if you think rogue v orc is annoying, wait till you try rogue v dwarf :/
---
Nope, you don't go OOM that's a very outdated notion from players going max rank on spells and mismanaging potions. In a half decent guild you should never go OOM. If you do, just adjust the raid accordingly to fit in a druid for Innervate.
---
It hasn't been mentioned here yet but I recall seeing a guide for Druids doing stealth runs of sunken temple. He was killing a boss and then vendoring the weapons for a couple gold. Might be an option
---
My guild used a blind-bid DKP system and I fucking hated it.
---
Won't matter, they'll be stunned. Plus as a Rogue I don't use bleeds or dots anyway
---
.....im buying a beer hat to hook up red bull cans too now.

---
Hide of the Wild is a crafted item, not MC/Ony. Source is a Dire Maul recipe, so it won't be available till Phase 2. It is correctly replaced in Phase 3 BWL.
---
With retail wow you can farm gold easily enough to buy tokens for each account so that's not much of an issue.
---
require more effort than other tank classes? 
---
look up guides on how to tank as a paladin to help you with these issues?
---
It's impossible to finish the survey for someone who doesn't raid. Had to cancel it in the middle.
---
&gt; That’s why I pulled from a neutral site.
---
I think the problem here is that how do you KNOW its a neutral site or that the info is even remotely correct ? Do you have the expertise and knowledge to look at the data and say, yeah, thats correct. Because if you see that list as good, neutral info, i dont think you really do.
---
Example, priests and druids have 15 off-tier prio items in aq40-naxx. Compared to shamans 5. This is your neutral data ? It includes AV rewards, BOE epix that you cannot get from raids. How are these in any way "contested BIS" ? Then again It doesnt mention other stuff thats in the same category, like beast deck that absolutely is amazing for a priest. 
---
Im sure that was a lot of work, but if its based on data thats meh at best...
---
Yah... nice monitor but I wont be envying your neck muscles after a long rep grind. :D
---
How do you see results already? :o
---
&gt; raids will be easier than pservers 
---
This is probably a fact but it is not what the question asked. The question was:
---
&gt;Will raids be **considered** generally harder or easier than they were on private servers?
---
People will wipe and they will not accept that they are fighting the easier version of a boss. There will be many people that never played on a pserver and have no reference but will still assume they know everything. What the general public thinks about things has less to do with facts and more with emotions. People hate to admit that they dont have pro gamer moves.
---
If you want to AoE grind, you have to no-life it to get ahead of everyone else, to have uncontested farming spots.
---
I've seen videos where raid boss have been tanked with hunter pets or warlock voidwalkers.
---
So I’m confused why with DKP there isn’t like a second round at say 33% cost so that upgrades never get D/E’d
---
Seal of crusader is consider your go-to dps buff for static fights that last long . You don't see it much since it's counter intuitive to use it during PvP engagements or 5/10m  (with the exception of releasing it as a judgement) and retr. spec is not a popular raiding spec either.
---
Edit: Is annoying to reserve one debuff slot for SotC on bosses in raids, there are superior raid-wide debuffs to be used in those limited 16 slots.
---
He wasn't even trying!
---
Im in the same boot but with horde.
---
I want to min-max my character, so planning on going ORC rogue.  However they are ugly as fuck and thats why i also think on undead, because does a little bit more dps worth hating the way you look?  You will looking at that character for thousand of hours.
---
The drop rates are not accurate as far as I know, the pattern cannot drop with out a 300 tailor present (Robes of the Archmage worked this way in the day) RoA is estimated to be \~25% with tailor present.

**About us**: We are a rather young guild, formed only a few months ago with currently close to 150 members, consisting mostly of experienced vanilla veterans and/or """unofficial""" classic server players.
---
We intend to level at a medium pace. That means we won't stop to smell the roses or "explore" every corner of azeroth but we do not want to rush the game either. 
---
Instead we hope to do all sorts of fun guild activities together along the way, such as guild-only dungeon runs (off-meta builds aka. memespecs are fine, too), lots of pvp, etc.
---
Non-raiders, casuals and socials are very welcome to join us as well, as we're trying to build a big community rather than just a raid roster.

**What we can offer:**
---
- active and well designed discord server
---
- organized guild bank
---
- spreadsheets for professions, rosters, etc.

**PvE**: We expect to have a raid ready roster of ***atleast*** 40 people within about 2 months after launch and clear Molten Core before Phase 2 starts. 
---
**PvP**: While we're not too pvp focused, we still want to do some organized wpvp together during phase 1 and 2 and premade battlegrounds later on. If theres a high demand we will do even more PvP stuff, like city raids and duel tournaments.

Most importantly, we wish our members to help each other, even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange!

**Recruitment**: We have a pretty balanced roster and don't lack any specific classes right now so we're recruiting every class and role (except Main Tanks for Phase 1).

We still need a warlock and a mage class leader though so we're currently looking for a socially capable player who knows the class inside and out in all context and is willing to help others. Class leaders will also be part of the loot councils and recruit more members of their class if needed.

If you're interested please contact me on Discord **[Howaito#3139]** or join **OUR SERVER (discord.gg/VquUGmu)** so we can get to know each other until Classic release!

I have the same monitor i bought it with the idea of having 2 1080p without border but played some fullscreen for the lulz and now i love it and can't go back, oof!
---
I'm sorry, what's "gross" about that?
---
Read the books. You’ll learn about zones and then get to visit them, so each zone you’ll notice things you remember from the book.
---
I once knew a rogue with thunderfury because no one else in the guild wanted / needed it. He basically used to meme with it in PvP. Granted this was basically at the end of vanilla.
---
play pally keep an eye on your hearth and bubble cd's.
---
rogues are only "vulnerable" while actually grinding mobs/questing.
---
druids can get out of a lot of sticky situations.
---
dungeons are safe and showed much higher exp/hr than expected on the beta so deffinetly a solid option but may leave you lagging behind on rep.
---
my favorite fishing spot as alliance is the barrens...  but I'm sure there are quieter spots.
---
Stay retail bro
---
I don't appear to have this option. Sadface. Am I missing something (other than the obvious)?
---
Fill it out.
---
Oh, I did. Must have missed it. &gt;.&lt;
---
Fair enuff. Im a Druid so none of this means anything to me except Arathi shoulders. I dont like pvp though so I will skip this one as well, despite being BiS for entire vanilla
---
I doubt rhat its the case with the new macro system
---
Go forth to victory.
---
Probably free servers transfers to even out that server pop with some lower pop servers I'd bet. No one here knows.
---
warr is awesome in pvp...if you have a healbot/dispeller enabling your high dmg output and healing reduction debuff...and if you have good gear. That's the problem with warr in vanilla. It's hard to get good pvp gear. Also the fact that you can't raid with a pvp spec, and you're generally bad at solo farming gold to allow for respecs...and you need raiding gear (at least the weap) to be good in pvp...unless you go for the r14 weaps but cmon..that's for crazy ppl.
---
 *3 months post launch, how would you describe the average 60 dungeon group? (strat/scholo/ubrs)*
---
**68% - CC/marking of 1 target casual pulling/speed.**  
---
Nah.
---
They remove it anyway and you just have to deal with an overpopulated server.  Might also offer transfers.
---
Nightfall is a phase 3 weapon, so they can't use it in mc. And whether a player uses Nightfall or a weapon for more personal dmg is up to them. Even, if they use nightfall primarily, they still have the option to use them effectively in pve and pvp over your pvp only use case.
---
yup
---
It may have existed at release, but they removed it during vanilla I remember the % hp to xp working the way it did. I remember the token knowledge that a character from the opposite faction could help you farm because they couldnt nerf your xp by assisting.
---
I think it's bad for the game and that is why it was removed, but if it stays my main is the literal best class to abuse this with and I'll make 1000's power lvling people.
---
unstoppable force is kinda meh for warriors. mace specialization isnt that good imo. Axes and words are much better. That's why I prefer an ashkandi over a sulfuras on a warr for esample. Even though the best weap is Bonereaver's Edge imo. Both for 2h pve and pvp.
---

Well the posts are from 1.10/1.11 that I noticed.  My personal experience with our guild fury warrior was around BWL release which was obviously earlier.  Hard to corroborate my personal findings though so forum posts were harder evidence.  He did top tier damage.  Just had an issue with aggro and splatting due to pulling it really really frequently.
---
Your logic here is so dumb. If we continue down that road, why not give the caster staves to hunters and the best guns/bows to warriors just cause it's so unconventionally interesting to watch?
---
Yeah very strange because I have the classic client (the one the actual classic wow is going to run on) just that there are no available realms until probably name day.
---
Free transfers to servers that aren't full. If all servers are full they'll create new ones.

---
hoping they do the stress test on the day of the name reserves, would be cool to get to play the stress test and get to reserve names/characters
---
I played it for a while and while I did not find it the most exciting, the advantage of auto-attack style is that you can really think ahead. It's not twitchy and you have plenty of time to overview the battlefield or check the health of your teammates while dps-ing.
---
Where on my druid I continually had to manage the combopoints and which ability to use at which moment (depending on energy, so I had to closely watch that too) and with my hunter I had to watch the autoshot-timer all the time, hence losing out on what happens on the battlefield.

I was in a pserver guild with ret paladin GM. He took the first Ashkandi that dropped (pretty late) and the three weeks later he took the Kalimdor sword from Twin Emps in AQ40. "It's MS for me guys" - to the 10 warriors standing around waiting.
---
Whenever we were wiping on Cthun he kept "joking" that he needed Dark Edge of Insanity for next upgrade. He never got it.
---
Memers taking pvp loot is very real. Ret paladins most of all. Fuck, last 3 Ashbringer's I've seen went to holy paladins for PvP. You are never safe as warrior with Arms dreams.
---
Freaking awesome man. Jealous.
---
"Local New Yorker and WoW Classic enthusiast accidentally leaks online that he is indeed the secret identity of Spider-Man. More at 6."
---
It would still mean faster clear speeds. More threat means dps can do more dps which means faster clear speeds.
---
As a general rule it's probably best to grind mobs that are same level/one level below. However depending on what class you play it can change a little. Also something to consider are loot from mobs. The higher level mobs the better the loot.
---
I plan to roll a warlock. I'm seriously considering grinding high level mobs with 5/5 suppression( reduce resist chance for affliction spells by 10%). I tried it on a private server briefly, went to duskwood at lowest possible level for being able to pick up quests. Worked ok. Is nice for a change to have the items mobs drop being worth equipping. Also you get more income from mobs though perhaps it evens out because of faster killspeed doing lower level stuff.
---
&gt; running into a wall is a terrible example because the players are not actually moving and will not display the range properly. The attempt to stand at the same range on private/beta is not the same either and small changes to direction changes the range aswell making these tests utterly useless.
---
Why though? Standing at the wall and running into it triggers the leeway. Thus, it only makes it easier to actually see the range of leeway. And how do you know that changes in direction make a difference? What does that even mean? Is there a range between 1 and 2 of leeway depending on the direction? And how do you know?
---
&gt; People who played private servers a lot and who do pvp a lot INSTANTLY noticed a HUGE difference in leeway when they played on the beta.
---
Just because they never noticed it before does not mean that it wasn't there before? In the beta people were actively looking for things that are different and were very critical. Maybe they weren't as much on private servers.
---
Also: Blizzard compared leeway to their original 1.12 client and confirmed that it is the way it was back then as well.
---
Please provide some evidence/sources to what you are saying.
---
It's just a matter of time. In 3 Months, people get kicked out of raids for being useless. Little Timmy over there brings same utility and even heals, making room for a real dps that btw does 3 times as much. Hmm.
---
The man is a national treasure.
---
Yeah with the way how bad AOE grinding currently is... I don't think a mage is going to get far ahead of the pack. Definitely a hunter is going to be World first 60. 
---
Sad because I loved how quick the Mage on the last PServer Launch was...

Can’t you just throw on some Linkin Park and call it a day?

Warlock: Making healthstones, summoning. Demons and chucking shadowbolt crits are neat too but I'm a surprisingly helpful soul and the warlock class fits that despite seeming "evil" lore and aesthetic-wise.

I’ll quote from another post like this:
---
“Let me just quickly turn around and check my buffs.”

j/k. awesome. wish i had this.
---
He fell for the curved monitor meme
---
As opposed to other players, who play wow to not have fun.
---
Best comment.
---
Because the overhead of a guy being kicked out your raid ten mins early or something is crazy. What it would effectively mean is raid times being cut short by fifteen to thirty minutes based on any issues people had. 
---
Also how would you deal with a DC or some technical issue.
---
It's just an extremely low level coordination issue.
---
But then you don't sound like you want to discuss the issue in any detail you just want to badmouth someone who engaged about your idea. Maybe classic isn't the game for you if you don't like community discussion?
---
I've never waited as soon as i had a vanilla itch i play a month or 2 on vanilla pvt severs.
---
I enjoy DPS **because** it is the most scrutinized. I like the competition. If you actually are #1, then the utility doesn't matter. Someone else can bring that. And you know what? He's probably a healer too. Things like damage mitigation, threat generation and healing are much more nuanced than DPS. Utility is worthless without dps. It is just nice to have. The goal of every boss fight is still to put its health to 0
---
Also a weirdly fun thing to do is buff people with unending breath. Helps tonnes with underwater quests (I'm looking at you Arathi Highlands)
---
I kill mages. That's the reason I rolled hunter in the first place.
---
Not everyone is going to be there at the same time, plus private servers have been doing it for years and it's never been an issue
---
Ah it does, but it references the Draenei, Naaru, etc so I thought it might be a bit too much, especially since Classic doesn't visit Outland, that's the Burning Crusade Expansion.   
---
Then again, in Through the Dark Portal you also go to Outland.. so yes, maybe Rise of the Horde would be a good starting point :) especially if you saw the movie!
---
Seeing as mages get 6% hit from talents, ZG enchants not long after, and other hit gear pieces, most if not all mages skip Angelistina's grasp for almost anything else. Warlocks also need 6% more hit.
---
let me guess you globaled some random undergeared sub 2k hp player and think thats commonplace? lol pro tip dude you don't 100-0 people in CS-KS in 2019.
---
theres a difference between wierd stuff happening and a purposely implemented mechanic that does not replicate vanilla gameplay because of todays hardware
---
I was on the fence about getting an ultra wide until I saw this :o
---
There will be a lot of people who play current retail WoW that will definitely try it on the first day. They are already subbed, it's released, why not try it out to see what all the fuss is about?
---
Wtf is a rouge?
---
Major story factor in Rise of the Horde is the TBC version of draenei, which is kinda extended lore that doesn't fit well in Vanilla timeline. It is a good book, but not someone who tries to prepare for Classic.
---
&gt; There will be a lot of people who play current retail WoW that will definitely try it on the first day
---
Then they know what they're in for logging on the first day. Those people aren't swayed by some mob competition. The casuals that will quit because of it aren't itching at the chain to get on asap.
---
Hmm, yeah, I particularly want to drop Tailoring for Alchemy before Bloodvine is relevant (idk if I'd ever get that far, lol).
---
Saying that 30% of players won't make it to 40 is super optimistic. I'd say that 50% of players won't make it to level 20 even.
---
I can taste the tears from here.
---
 Just start out playing like you normally do. You will become accustomed to the threat of being attacked and adjust your approach a bit over time. I wouldn't try and rush leveling or hide inside instances to avoid PvP. If you are inside instances all the way you are in my opinion missing so much about what makes classic fun. I want to experience the world and feel like I am playing a MMO. 
---
 Can add as well that I am a carebear too. I never attack anyone, I only try and be aware of my surroundings and defend myself if someone is attacking. If I want to fish etc I try and find less crowded spots. Even though I don't attack people it's fun being on a PvP server. Always being in danger and having to be aware makes the game a lot more interesting and fun. Can be frustrating at time of course as well but it's worth it.
---
Warrior: VIP in PvE (Tanking), MVP in PvP if you get a healbot
---
Ultrawide isn't for everyone. When I bought my new monitors, I didn't go for ultrawide either, but that's because I wanted 1 screen dedicated to the application and another screen for stuff on the side (A browser, movie, guide, whatever)
---
This post is very necessary. You showed them.
---
He's talking about speedruns. And at that point the fastest runs will indeed be horde.

---
My plan was to level Ret and get 5/5 Vengeance asap then swap over to Holy talents to heal as much as I can above 45
---
I guess the /s is necessary in my previous post.
---
This gives me anxiety.
---

I want to play an elemental shaman but I don't want to be weighing down a raid by playing a bad spec so I'll be speccing resto and healing until I've got enough bits to PvP with when I can. I think I'd leave a guild if they drag along actual ele shamans who contribute nothing and give the ele focused bits to him. Or you'll just see all the hybrids who are healing and wanting to dps (probably quite a lot) all just swap over to the meme specs because why not
---
Krol blade is usually 200g in ah
---
Like I said, I guess returning guilds and older players will, but I think most guilds will just run with loot council.
---
rekt kid.
---
Whaddayaknow, more players = more ganks!?
---
Do you play alliance? 🤔
---
Horrible for playing shooters, but other games I guess it's OK. I have 27 inch monitor, and still the 24 inch is the best for shooters (I play shooters mostly).
---

---
Did i happen to kill you in Redridge or Stonetalon? I have a ganking char in both!
---
You should feel a sharp sting in your neck according to comments
---
2000-3000 is what the game is design for it's not a technical limitation at least not anymore, private servers had the use heavily modified spawning rules to generate enough resources to make the game playable with that many players.
---
&gt; except using strong words, like autism or retardism.
---
So you got killed by autists and retards? That makes you seem like a bad player
---
I play horde :)
---
I cat believe you didn't mention MC ppl and throw them into the lava at molten core entrance. Watch them paddle in the lava hahaha
---
There aren't meme classes, only meme specs.
---
Agreed
---
It just doesn't seem right getting to play like this. Great set up btw.
---
&gt; private servers had to use heavily modified spawning rules to generate enough resources to make the game playable with that many players.
---
Kevin Jordan himself said they had dynamic spawning/tweaked spawn rates when the game launched. They could just do the same thing again
---
Sadly no, spriests are not that good in PvE, if you had a spriest in top 5 on single target fights it means that you ONLY had one fury war, one rogue, one mage and one warlock, which is so far from the reality of an usual 40 man raid that i'm inclined to call BS on your statement. 
---
Spriest dps is so bad that most top end guilds chose to bring a support priest with enough points into shadow for keeping shadow weaving up.
---
God I miss the days when everyone was using tier 0 instead of clown armour from random dungeons.

* **Server region: EU** 
---
* **Server type: PvP ⚔️**
---
* **Faction: Horde** 
---
* **Semi-hardcore  | PvE  &amp; PvP** 
---
**Introduction:**   
---
Havoc (Horde PvP EU) is starting off as a group of friends from IRL, mixed with old guildies returning for Classic and fellow Classic fanboys.
---
**What are we about?**  
---
 As cliché as it sound we’re planning on being a very social and flexible guild for the beginning of Classic’s life.
---
One of (if not the) best ways to experience WoW is to enjoy the journey to 60 with friends, checking out all the zones and dungeons whilst having a good time in Discord chat.
---
**After launch &amp; 60+ plans:**  
---
Once we have enough players hitting 60 I’m pretty confident guildies will make it clear what kind of content they want to focus on.
---
There really is no reason why we can’t have players forming a team for premade PvP stomps AND those with PvE in mind banding together to tackle the latest raid the current phase has to offer.
---
The best thing about having a mix of players with PvP or PvE as a focus, is that every single one of them will need to head to the same place to start gearing up. Dungeons!
---
Guild dungeon runs will be popping off regularly, which in turn helps bring new players into the guild, get people geared and hit the next stage of content together.
---
**What we are looking for:**  
---
Like minded players above all else. If you're new, a returning veteran or Naxx speed run clear record holder there is a place for you among us. Together we can teach new players, clear our favourite Classic content and push our limits.  
---
 One thing to bear in mind is a majority of our members are 25+. Have families, full time jobs or other heavy responsibilities and therefore not a lot of time for needless drama. Of course some of us will be blessed with more time on our hands to commit to raids, hardcore PvP and owning the Auction House, and we will accommodate that approach without a doubt. Just be mindful of others and have a good time!   
---
**Raid Schedule:**  
---
The current thinking is that we would raid 2 - 3 days a week.  
---
2 days in the evening of a weekday around 7PM - 9PM BST. 1 weekend 5PM - 7PM.  
---
Times and days are almost 100% likely to change once classic launches and we balance everything around our raid teams preferences.
---

despite barely doing pvp because Im a filthy carebear and basically just do pve, Im gonna be a UD mage rather than troll because UD males have the best /dance in the game. 
---
haters gonna hate.
---
Holy Paladin can do the exact same things as Ret Paladin.
---
Depends a lot on what you wanna do. For threat you basically wear dps gear. For survival you wear armor and stam.  
---
DFT definitely fits into the threat gear.  
---
Should a feral get it? Most likely not.
---
I was part of one of the top guild on the Pserver LH and we had the only paladin with a thunderfury, he tanked BWL just fine. That was not on progression tho, we had AQ40 on farm.
---
I'm sorry, I meant that at the time of WoW's launch, most people's first experience with online gaming was with Halo 2, CoD or WoW. And I know that because I lived it. Xbox Live was the first mainstream online gaming service and Halo 2 was the first super mainstream game that utilized it. 
---
Before WoW, the only things people played online were Everquest, WC2/SC, Ultima Online, Quake/Doom and Runescape. Those games probably only had MAYBE 100k players each at their peak, so it's pretty safe to assume that since WoW ended up having millions of players that it was a lot of people's first experience with online gaming.
---
I'm hoping to see people mind controlled off the great lift in thousand needles
---
Mad cuz bad
---
Go buy a spare power cable for the PC
---
i wanted to link the same video.
---
people should forget about aoe grinding 1-60
---
maybe some sort of dungeon farming groups will be viable
---
Yeah I'm more or less looking at it as a money making thing at this point myself. The actual AOE grind will be much easier once things have normalized
---
and i remember pulling whole dungeons in TBC with a pala and boosting friends with dynamite mobtag leave to 60 in less than a day
---
who remembers right?
---
I wouldn't mind transmog after like a year of phase 5.
---
Stun, fear, sleep, ect.  
---
Anything that basically counts as total loss of control of your character is not a “movement impairing” effect .... it basically follows DnD rules.
---
Ah, that's dumb, as it does impair your movement. Thank you.
---
I heard about Classic at the end of 2018, 6 months is already a loooooong wait !
---
 The retardism of **a minority of** private server players\*
---
Why imp on passive?
---
Layering helps on server launch to the starting area pressure. To push more people in the same server to offset the eventual drop off. You know, the reasons everyone know they are there.
---
But crit is what made warriors strong.
---
More crit &gt; more flurry &gt; more rage &gt; more yellowhits &gt; more crits
---
Method has said they want to add the classic world firsts to their achievement book so I wouldn’t discount the horde yet.
---
Evil shenanigans 🍀🍀
---
I agree. Herbalism makes just so much sense on a druid.
---
You can quickly run from node to node without mounting up every time and you can use tools like stealth and hibernate to avoid having to kill mobs while doing so.
---
Who would go on the internet and lie, that is just down right unfathomable.
---
And some serious neck ache, I couldn’t cope with my
---
ultra wide any more and have revered back to standard. Just a novelty.
---
I don't understand the Thunderfury question. So I put "mage" :p
---
&gt;I was usually competing for top dps slot vs our guild hunter at the time. And loved the competition.
---
Man that guild sucked.
---
&gt; To not have the servers be completely dead after the drop-off
---
Did you even read the posts title? We're talking about if the servers numbers don't drop off and the guy I replied to said we would have queues if that happens so we would then have layering AND queues. How do so many people keep coming in here and spout off nonsense without read the actual fucking post?
---
Guess it seems like TF does work out pretty well, but not for progress, looking at other responses. Great for clearing old content where you could aoe tank a lot more.
---
Was just a thought and I guess you're right :)
---
Maybe, does the proc scale with spellpower? In that case, a spelladin might actually be quite viable.
---
At the time of launch a lot of people had been playing online for years. I was one of them, so this "most people" claim doesn't make sense unless you have actual data to support it. Which I know you don't.
---
Internet was the first mainstream online gaming service. To say they only had 100k at their peak is insanely wrong and its exactly why you shouldn't pull numbers out of your arse like I've been saying from the start. In 2001 EverQuest alone had 500k subs. Ultima online 250k. EverQuest 2 and Star Wars Galaxies and Final Fantasy XI also had well over 200k subs before XBL. This is before I even begin to mention a myriad of other games like Age of Empires, Runescape, Cod, MoHAA. 
---
So not only was it not safe for you to assume, but even if you were right about the players at their peak (you weren't even close) you then went on to make an additional assumption that most people played either Halo 2 or CoD or WoW first. Which you literally have no idea about, its completely unquantifiable you've just pulled it from the ether and stated it as fact.
---
The bottom line here is, saying numbers ***will*** drop is unsubstantiated nonsense. Saying you think they're ***likely*** to drop based on private servers, is fine.
---
Like you said, they ask you to play Shadow, they aren't telling you to. 
---
It's all about freewill.
---
&gt;I like warriors, but eveyone and their mums play them.
---
Yes but everyone and their mums *suck at tanking*.
---
Honestly with the amount of complaints you have it sounds like you're be better off sticking to WOTLK private servers or retail.
---
Bringing Welcome Bear on a tour.
---
That's because the man who did this sheet is a retard and if people are gonna follow sheets made by retards then we wont have much fun on classic. QSR is BiS for warriors forever
---
You can play however you like.  That doesn’t mean everyone else has to accept you in the group because you’re the pacifist HPS Warrior who wants to spam bandages while never attacking an enemy.
---
A lot of you class complaints seem overblown to me, but that's on you to figure out.
---
Sounds like you want to play TBC.
---
Yep, agreed. Of course it's not "insane". But you can turn it around. Let's say I could not manage to get my pre raid bis in one slot for a reason and the other guy did, I will look OK with the racial.  
---
I agree that it's not that big of a deal for many races / classes combo. But for a melee class playing with swords, human IS a pretty big deal.  
---
like for a warlock, i'm with you. for warr rogue, if you are remotely min maxer, it's important. It's the reason i'm rolling human instead of dwarf for my pve main. even though dwarf is my favorite race by a long long shot. :/
---
I think you should read it if you are going to play horde, it will give you an idea of what the orcs went through to get to Azeroth
---
Phrantasia if you think this list is correct, then you are as clueless as the guy who made it. Seems like any list with wrong stuff is getting upvoted these days just because people think its correct even tho its crap.
---
and don't pick up the soap. It's bad for you.
---
&gt; The back end is based on 8.X
---
It's actually the 7.3.5 client, but yea it's based on a modern version of the client not the old 1.12 client.
---
No wonder the list is crap. Crap site, crap list. Not much else to say other than dont follow this or you will be viewed as noobs and retards on classic.
---
Just swap item appearance in itemcache.wdb and you will look same again with whatever gear you have equipted now. Only you can see that as it is your cache, but it doesnt brake anything that you could be banned for as other mention with Model Editing textures and so on to the patch.mpq files. PM if you would like help or short tutorial, its 2min job :-)
---
sure, as you get better gear it goes up from there. But that (TUF/OEB-ish weapons) was just the threshold where I noticed that you started to have enough rage and damage to be able to do OK in pvp.
---
Pretty sure anyone planning on poopsocking their way to 60 isn’t doing it because of some social pressures, they’re doing it because they want to and enjoy it.
---
People can do whatever they want.
---
 If you like support roles then I assume you don't want to compete with other DPS-ers. I would suggest warrior-tank (more specific off-tank) as there is high demand of tanks in every guild. Even with the plethora of warriors you claim to be (don't be so sure about that, it may vary from server to server) most will roll as fury or arms spec.   
---
 Your job as an offtank is to tank when needed, debuff bosses with annihilator, nighfall, improved demo shout, intercept mobs heading into the raid, etc and you will still be able to main tank if there is a need. As for engineering you aren't forced to pick it, it has quality of life items, but other options are optimal/viable. Professions like alchemist+herbalist (which will allow you to grind gold in protection spec - and you only need the lab for the big flasks), skinning+herb combo will help you on getting some extra gold as farming in prot spec is tedious af and enchanting  or axesmith/armorsmith services will be much appreciated by your guild.   
---
  I'm not sure what you mean by "independent" professions. Acquiring high-end recipes for all professions is a collective effort, from raiding 20/40m to 5/10m dungeons, same goes for their crafting materials. You might have a hard time on grinding recipes in 5/10m if you don't run with a trusted group of guild members and you might pay huge amounts of gold to acquire the raiding ones.
---
My experience from back in the day: human male warriors were always played by people with poor English skills, or dimwitted people. It can be hard to tell the difference:)
---
[Here’s a link ](https://youtu.be/XhMM3fhqPY0)  to a virtual 360 degree video of the tavern with the music... Simply amazing!
---
That sounds more like a people problem.
---
Resto vs Enh is the same issue as fury vs arms.
---
One is just better in all ways.
---
One helps the raid by increasing raid damage/success, the other lets you leech pvp gear.
---
Why should the enh/ret be rewarded extraordinarly with gear they aren't going to use in raid?
---
Meme spec? The post I replied to was bitching about losing pvp stuff to meme specs IN RAIDS, which I provided an extended example of.
---
Yes you will differ from other warlocks, there are 2 main dps builds for warlocks but improved imp usually isn't taken because you will be giving up dps talents. One warlock usually sacrifices their dps to get improved imp and becomes the hero of the tank group.
---
You clearly don’t pvp
---
I mean deep bear and deep cat have different specs, albeit minimal differences. Having a feral off tank just means less overall nightfall procs anyways, it doesn't matter if Blizzard improved Feral, the reality is a bear will never be optimal outside of a very few specific encounters. You don't have to min max anything, which means Bear can make a very suitable raid off tank, but you're still just gimping the raid overall.
---
&gt;I'm not a min/maxer, but I'd like to be competitive in end game
---
Not sure if I see a substantial difference. You sound like someone who cares about minmaxing waaay too much.
---
And that community will keep up their own "leaderboard". And will praise/trash-talk/discuss in their own communities.
---
You don't haft to look, and even if they leak into the general public, its a small exposure, and you can just be "k" and move on.
---
Growing up in WoW, I didnt even learn about "hardcore raiders" and all that they chased until wrath.
---
Check out The Vanilla Drean on YouTube, he plays a dps shaman and ret pally in raids, he recently did a video on 1h enh shaman, not top of the pack dps but still good. Hes got good gear though, 2.5 set and hand of rag he used in a 2h ele build.

Why are you generalizing everyone wants to race to 60?

You can make macros in Classic to change your gear. Mogging allows you to display an appearance other than the gear you’re wearing. This makes it so it’s difficult to assess the type of player you’re about to fight and it also impacts the sense that you’re living in a world with physical limitations.
---
Inventory management gives value to larger bags and also contributes to the feeling of a world with physical limitations. It also contributes to a whole bunch of strategizing loops such as planning when to go back to sell, thinking what to discard, analyzing when investing in a new bag is worth it, etc.
---
&gt; If you're really concerned about 10 minutes of downtime, 
---
Heh, I use to spend hours configuring my addons and UI. Personally, I don't want to spend that much time to set things up on launch. I'm going to be using only basic addons and will probably use the default UI while I"m leveling.
---
They are extremely common based on what I am seeing as a recruitment officer.
---
The balance of dwarves and priests etc are going to be very different compared to vanilla it seems.
---
I'm still rolling one myself though!
---
A lot of info online is badmouthing Paladins and druids so it looks like priests are the default choice for a lot of people.
---
Obviously it's just what I am seeing, but at least it's somewhat evidence based.
---
Hi. Nova Scotia here. I have been waiting for a guild like this for awhile &lt;3 :D what's the best way to be considered?
---
I got you fam http://imgur.com/DcQLyQo
---
You sure seem to know a lot about a game that you say you barely played as one class. Sounds like ur thinking too much into it. U hate engineering? That doesn’t even make sense lol. you’re probably just not good at figuring out how to use them so no u don’t have the right mindset.
---
And only one dwarf. It's like Cartman of the guild. You can't be a dwarf butters, I'm the dwarf.
---
&gt;The primary reason to use the transcendent piece over Truefaith is as a piece for the 3set bonus. Without the bonus, Truefaith is always better.
---
Which is what the OP you responded to you said in the first place, just not quite so verbosely?
---
I disagree with transmogging being fine. It damages the sense of world and makes it so you can’t tell the type of gear someone your fighting has. Also it takes away from the value of getting nice looking gear (looking like a clown for a bit makes you appreciate when you start looking put together).
---
As a mage you should be able to AOE farm Hearthglen for good money.
---
My first character was an undead warlock. I was really young and didn't understand the nuances of the class. Pet management, damage over time versus immediate damage and (my biggest sin) thinking life tap was dumb because WHY WOULD I EVER WILLINGLY LOSE HEALTH!?
---
I abandoned the character and made a tauren warrior, eventually getting to 60 a month before TBC. Honestly thought he was super easy to play and between alchemy and first aid I felt pretty durable while leveling, so it worked out.
---
Other noob mistakes mostly involve wasting my gold on dumb stuff.
---
\- Putting too much stock in enchants while leveling. On my warrior I would spend a tremendous amount of gold enchanting every single weapon/gear upgrade I got. We're talking paying for firey weapon enchant like five times over between the levels of 45-60.
---
\- Making too many alts and funneling gold to them. Most never made it to a level where they made the gold back. I was constantly sending a few gold to characters that made it to the low 20s and then dropping them.
---
\- Constantly looking for BoE upgrades on the AH. It was common practice for me to look at the AH every time I went back to train skills, sort by usable and item level and just starting hunting for upgrades. If a BoE green belt was even slightly better than the one I had, I bought it, only to replace it within another level or two.
---
Because they are going to use it? 
---
Nightfall doesn't exist before Phase 3, so bonereavers edge and sulfuras are enh/ret weapons per se, because they are bis.
---
And even when nightfall exists, most raiding ret/enh don't want to use this weapon all the time, so they will use any 2h weapon upgrade they get in the raid as well, which you as dw fury will not. 
---
If you want to have the same priority on 2h weapons, then raid as arms or 2h fury. What does it matter that it's less optimal than dw fury? But saying, specs which use 2h weapons in raids don't deserve 2h weapon upgrades over a spec which doesn't use them in raids is utterly silly.
---
Also, half of those mums will be switching to a Rogue or Mage after they realize how painful it is to level a warrior. :D
---
I mean, it's 15$ for the first month. Worst case scenario you "waste" 15$. For that same 15$, you can also play Retail. Or just WAIT and watch others and see if you care anymore. Pretty simple.
---
If you wait the sap out DR won't matter cause the fight will have reset.
---
What are the new changes? I thought there was just layering and the 16 debuff slots.
---
Well that's just wonderful to read! I hope it's a good livin for ya :)
---
I remember going to a farming spot which was super high level because there was a safe spot in a corner and then setting an auto-clicker to use a spell every five seconds to level up the lightning skill.
---
It's probably not meta anymore, but when I farmed by epic mount back in the day, I'd run Deadwind Pass and kill birds or orgres.  The birds drop a lot of high value vendor trash and the ogres dropped rune cloth.  DWP was good because it was not a quest area, there was almost never anyone there, and so the risk of getting ganked or competing was almost zero.
---
So Kevin Jordan is delusional?

Daggers. The Pet will probably hold threat pretty well, moreso if they go BM/MM.
---
Life is a race, Sprint fast Die Young
---
Well, beta/stress test/classic is 1.13. I could have been more clear that I meant the Vanilla 1.12. It seems also that even if 1.12 had the health bar not moveable, 1.13 will have it.
---
I think daggers. If the pet can hold aggro long enough things will die quickly and the rogue will be that much stronger for wPvP
---
That's right, worry about your own bowl of fun
---
Well, trying to get 39 people to re clear content they don’t need might just be a people problem

Tiny little feral cats would be adorable though.

Nah sounds like he wants to play LoL to me.
---
Easy way to a competitive end game.
---
Where he doesn’t need to think too much about making a choice because you can choose a new character every game and doesnt want to invest in something and finding out the character he picked isn’t easy mode, because there is no easy mode.
---
I'd go with 5 palas. This provides optimal distirbution of blessings.
---
4 is possible, but you'll lack BoL or BoSanc on most of the raid and have to buff the tanks extra every 5min.

---
Holy shit that is sweet, please post a video exploring, really curious.
---
Look at it this way. Try it, play it, put in time and grow attached to characters, because you know that with each expansion it will become more polished and structured just the way you like.
---
I guess you don't wanna play wow.
---
49in 3840x1080 master race. I got one recently and it is amazing for WoW.
---
I'd be interested to know which server you're rolling on!
---
Will the group be making multiple guilds or is the idea to pool everyone into one large Horde and Alliance guild?
---
Or level themselves,
---
Actually it will adapt to this player, as far as PVP structure goes.
---
What else
---
A mage after my own heart. We did the same. We coordinated between the 3 mages (25 man raids at the time) who was putting which portal first. Stack on top of one another. First 3 were always Stonard, Silvermoon, and Thunderbluff.
---
I think he sounds like someone who wants minmax results. Without minmaxing himself.
---
On some bosses, others the armor is way too low, Plus resists, scripting, threat mamagent etc.
---
No one has seen the real game in 12 years. Playing pirated knockoffs doesn't help with theorycrafting at all.
---
I have some money on the side. Moved to another town with my GF and left my job. I plan to play 1-2 months totally no lifing that thing before finding a new one.
---
Thunderclap is a waste, you should just demo shout on pull instead and spam battle shout in between sunders, for more than 4 mobs. For less than 4 you probably don't need the battle shout spam.
---
You don't need to play 18hrs a Day to get into Raids. Raids are so casual that you easily can clear them every Week as a Casual. I guess MC, Ony will be cleared by 20man raids within ~2hrs.
---
That is only true because healing priests were rare and a difficult spot to fill.
---
They talked about creating "pure" servers for retail which would have some features disabled, e.g., no transfering on to them, slower leveling, no group finding tools, no wow tokens, that kind of thing.  Maybe certain slot machine elements disabled (e.g., no titanforged/socket rolls).
---
That would go a long way at revitalizing retail WoW.
---
I dunno how to explain it. I tried a few different classes when I first started. Rogue, warrior, druid. None clicked with me until I tried a mage. Something about hurling a fireball at skeletons in Tirisfal Glades in those early days just made me fall in love with the class.
---
Astonishing how all these jelly dudes are hating on you for buying something nice you wanted.
---
Pretty dope man
---
Sounds like a pserver experience.
---
&gt; most all feral druids will rarely farm them.
---
You're under the impression that a druid who wants to be the one druid tank isn't going to farm literally the best item for them that is easy to obtain? Do you live on another planet?
---
What he is describing is nothing like what you see on pservers. 10k pop has stuff respawning almost instantly. It's hard to quest in a cave without stuff respawning on top of you. Also there are way too many herb and mining nodes.

**TGIF is Recruiting for 1-night/week raiding!**
---
NA-PvP | Friday | 10pm-1am EST | Semi-Hardcore
---
Discord: https://discord.gg/zeUCYFm
---
DKP Based Loot System (loot council for legendaries)
---
Recruiting: Holy priests and holy paladins.  Other classes are closed.
---
Intro: TGIF was created to provide busy adults with the opportunity to see Classic WoW's raid content with the most minimal time requirements - 1 night, 3 hours a week (even during progression). We understand that the limited raid hours may result in slower progression in the later phases of vanilla, but we're excited to build a community and progress as efficiently as we can during our raid-time. Also, we think that there are probably a lot of other talented players out there who want to tackle Classic, but don't want to have to push work, sleep, or family obligations to the back-burner.
---
Expectations: Given the limited schedule, we need to have strong participation and preparation. We require a 75% participation for raids, though we are flexible with RL schedules if something comes up. We will start raiding as soon as we have a critical mass at 60, hopefully 2-3months after launch
---
**Schedule: We will raid Friday from 10-1am EST (7-10pm PST).**
---
Optional Scheduling:
---
Organized PvP Premades
---
PUG Raiding: 40man raids will be hosted on Saturday/Sunday for any unfinished content, and no TGIF preference given to those who can or can't attend.
---
20 man raids TBD
---
If you are interested in joining, please join our discord or send me a PM with questions. See you in Azeroth!
---
And my point from my first post was that paladin tank generate less threat on single target, mitigate less and have trouble with mana and therefore it's not a viable solution for raid doing something else than farming old content.
---
Now if your argument is: content is so easy that people can do whatever they want if they outgear an instance then ok but then 'viable' has no meaning in this discussion.
---
Why though?
---
It's like with all these meme specs: can they be done?  Yes.  But it's similar to playing with both hands tied behind your back and stabbing your keyboard with a pencil held in your mouth.  Yes you can play, but why the fuck would you want to handicap yourself that much instead of just play a class where your effort is actually worthwhile?
---
Lol min/max. Just have fun with it. Chances are if you’re not a serious speed leveler then once you hit level 20 you will go at your own pace
---
Tukui takes ten seconds to configure :D
---
Should last until KTM and others come into play.
---
Lol! I think one kid is enough for now!
---
But why isn't SotC the preferable seal? Most of the paladins I saw back then (that did somewhat competitive damage) used non-spell powered gear, melee based buffs and usually a 2-H weapon with a proc effect. If you have a list of gear progression I would appreciate it.
---
Literally always.
---
It's classic, the players who want to be there will stay there
---
Loot council is the worst system I can think of, if your guild isn't one cohesive unit AND that the officers are incorruptible. What usually happens is that you have a guild with *very* well-geared officers and a constantly changing roster of people in their prebis.
---
I'd support *rolling* for an item before loot council.
---
Literally said it was from vanilla live like 2 posts down
---
I believe yellow hit cap is 8% whereas skill cap is +10.
---
Can everyone please confirm skill cap for 0 reduction on glancing blows?! O.o
---
Layering and sharding are two seperate things.
---
Actually paladin has some of the best damage mitigation in classic, the issue is mana and no taunt.  Thats why paladin tanks become so much more viable in TBC when they are given a taunt and have two mana regen mechanics.
---
&gt; Go on retail and watch PuGs form for groups.
---
lol, you mean go to a place where someone will get roasted and lose their entire raid or be kicked for not being meta talents/spec.
---
Of course casuals try to meta on retail, that is the only way they could attempt to survive.
---
That's the same reason people meta on pservers, the consequences of not doing it.
---
It wasn't. It was their way of making sure you only bid for items you truly needed and also a way to prevent people from stacking too much DKP. I didn't make the rules and I never said it was a good system.  
---
So basically - item would drop, if I wanted it I would /w leader my bid, let's say 500DKP. If someone /w leader with 600DKP, we both lose our respective DKP and dude that bid 600 gets the item.
---
I am perfectly aware that tooltips dont mean much in Vanilla.. *in a lot of cases.*
---
Anger Mangement for Warriors f.ex gives you 1 rage every tick instead of just slowing down rage outside of combat. But a tooltip being very vague and not telling the whole story (while otherwise being accurate) is quite different from a tooltip stating black on white that it has a 15% chance to proc..
---
Wouldnt you agree?
---
So the best looking and most amazing Tier set which is BiS for spelladin isn't from raiding?
---
None of them will go for any speed clears, maaybe in between tiers but even then they can't compete with years of experience from private server guilds
---
Technically speaking wouldn't phase 2 be the 1st content "patch"?
---
To be fair, on pservers the class is OP AF for PvP in the hands of a player who knows what thery are doing.
---
I'm not saying there aren't other classes who are broken OP (cough, Rogues, cough)
---
Seal of Righteousness also procs effects like that, so if you used a fast weapon (hand of edward) with SoR, you effectively get a proc every third hit, or a proc every 4.8 seconds which certainly would make it feel like a machine gun ;)
---
The point is you can't call something a cap or ceiling, if it's not a cap or ceiling. It's just stupid and unproductive.
---
You talk about mastery, but you don't even specify interval of time. Mastering a class in 2006 and in 2019 are completly different concepts of mastery. Some ppl even rely on private servers experience. So people rely on completly different data, most of them don't know/remember game at all. This is a fucking joke, not a discussion.
---
If our healer in a group is a priest, I feel at ease.
---
That's one of the few changes I like with retail. If you roll need, the item is automatically soulbound to your character.
---
Oh crap you're right I forgot they buffed the crap out of that belt in like 1.10
---
If it's a problem, don't stay in the guild. Corrupt loot councils are very rare on retail, because the guild quickly goes to shit when people realize. At least guilds going for speed clears and such will be using loot council to distribute loot in the best way possible.
---
Haven't these things been in at least one patch per expansion since MoP? I remember a lot of that stuff was in the Timeless Isle.
---
Could have been, I don't really remember. But people didn't really play to min/max as much then as they will now.
---
I'm still deciding between playing on my headphones or my surround speaker setup. Probably the former or else the wife is gonna get even madder.
---
first lesson of classic. people are toxic af deal it with
---
This was true for the Blizzcon demo, but they updated the codebase to 8.0 for this release. You can tell it isn't 8.1 because the multi-thread optimizations are not implemented (which is unfortunate)
---
Why do you think it's going to magically be any different in Classic? People play games differently in 2019 versus how they did in 2004. We have so many more resources at our disposal and our entire focus has switched to being as efficient as possible.
---
Classic isn't going to magically recreate 2004. Sure, there are people who will take things slow and steady, but as a whole there will still be a strong focus on the established meta because now we know better. And as I've said before, casual players are worse at following the meta because they do it blindly and need to have as many good players/specs as possible to balance out their skill level.
---
Mobs start hitting harder when everyone moves up an armor class and the incoming dps difference increases as well.  A shaman MT has the advantage of being able to have tides moved through his party so mana isn't really an issue (as compared to a pally MT), but you get creamed by bosses.
---
Hrm it looks like Priests use their transcendence set until AQ which is why they are listed at AQ (when they break the set)?
---
well yes, this is such a toxic community, damn
---
play wc3 and tft.
---
Just making sure cuz you seem to be taking this pretty seriously sperging over muh not an argument. But no racist shit will exist no matter what the name of an Axe is, but since you played private servers already know that.
---
Could you show me footage of this non-oom gameplay in dungeons and raids?
---
I'm genuinely interested.
---
\#1. DR wasn't a big issue in vanilla, people wanting no changes but want a fix to something that existed the entire time of vanilla?  mage don't exactly have a great time with leeway either.
---
\#2. Says kiss every match up good bye, goes on to say you lose to 7 specs out of 24? 
---
\#3. In what dream world are you paying 30g-100g (p1/p2) for arrows and what other class by themselves can farm even close to that, no one in phase 1 that's for sure, and hunter is still the king solo for DM. Also, oh no, RPG elements in an MMORPG, how awful! 
---
\#4. Having a high skill cap isn't a downside, not everyone wants to press frostbolt and decurse all night. 
---
\#5. The wolves that buff melee? how terrible it must be to think about other members of the raid! 
---
\#6. Play a fury warrior if the only thing you want to bring to raid is DPS.
---
Well any guild that played enough to get thunder fury had to know it was fool hardy to give it to a hunter, only way he could have got it is if he was lead and the guild was onboard with doing something silly
---
Thank you.
---
Ruthlessness is a bigger damage increase than Murder.
---
using the h500 as well, looks great man
---
Sure, if they enjoy it I’m all for it. Social pressure is probably a thing, but my post is more geared toward people thinking power leveling is mandatory in order to not miss out on the advantages of being among the X first players to ding 60. What I’m saying is don’t worry about it cause in the long run it doesn’t matter.
---
Lol Im curious to what you found, because I can tell you there is absolutely not 1 optimal spec for rogue pvp. All depends on what you're doing (world pvp, premades (which BG?), 1v1, solo BGs etc).
---
Dang dog.
---
It doesn't matter, whether Nightfall is better for overall raid dps, other 2h weapons are still pve upgrades for them and most raiding ret/enh will use them in the raid as well. They are not pvp items, so they should get priority. What is so hard to understand here?
---
You don't give a feral druid priority on healing items, because he wants to heal in pvp.
---
What you think about that doesn't matter. If you end up with a ret/enh in the raid, you should accept, that they are getting priority on their primary weapon type. And if you can't live with that, either find a raid without those specs or play a spec, which uses 2h weapons in raids instead of clamoring for equal rights on items, which are pve upgrades for other people and only pvp items for you.
---
I have never heard of anyone using this type of bidding system. I'm surprised your guild made it through the second week of raiding. I wonder how your guild stayed alive, assuming it did (?)
---
That’s a pretty shitty analogy, sorry.
---
Yeah, you are probably right. Thanks for pointing it out!
---
Well of course you can always optimize leveling to some extent its been done and gets improved all the time on pservers, wich i can agree its fun to watch. The fast ones will still be in 4-5 day playtime range. Most of the players trying wont be #1 60.
---
And as soon as you get weekly reset capped its all about killing the bosses once a week.
---
Dude it's not BiS, cmon. It's either naked or BiS OKAY?!
---
Some people just don't mind, personally I think I'll enjoy leveling until 40 and then just power through to 60.
---
Imagine if crafting were actual classes you'd have to roll an alt for.
---
That’s one update I’d vote for if classic comes with a poll like system similar to OSRS, id love to be an enhance shammy off tank that goes 2H and totem twist when not needed to OT
---
Lmaoooooo
---
You should have used a log scale for "number of players reaching X level", because I would have selected less than 10% for level 40 and level 60.
---
I tried it didn’t end well
---
All leveling guides I've seen literally skip learning the skill completely. As some said in the comments, it has its uses, like on EXTREMELY drawn-out long fights, you could judge SOTC, and keep it up by hitting melee and slightly buffing your damage.
---
In practice, you'd much rather have seal of light or wisdom, or if that's too high level then there's no fight in the game that'll make the initial dps loss of SOTC worth it for some points extra in each seal of righteousness...
---
It's cool if you group up with priests and they spam smite, if you're that big of a troll.
---
Never said it's correct. Ultkmately, much of this will be opinion-based. It's a great template and a good starting point though. It seems all people want to do on this sub is shit on other people while contributing nothing.
---
This info is great, but I dread a day where players use this to exempt non 'meta' classes from recieving loot, pushing people down a meta path despite it not being that important unless you're pushing end game early.
---
Classic will be around for years and years. You can get there, it may take 5 years but you can do it.
---
The real answer is "every realm will have different rules, and even in those realms many players won't know about or follow them, so clear it up with the leader first." Which is exactly how it actually worked in Vanilla.
---
&gt; its not entirely needed most of the time. 
---
What?
---
Threat generation is one of the main bottlenecks for your raid's dps all the way throughout vanilla. TF is an indirect increase to your raid's damage.
---
I'm curious as to when you've last done any kind of vanilla raiding.
---
True, I saw how cheap they were by Naxx on ND and it was pretty surprising tbh.
---
I think this is a lot less likely on population controlled servers though.
---
It doesn't matter how many people quit. Eventually enough players will reach level 60, so they won't be congesting the leveling areas. Layering isn't implemented to manage the number of players idling in Ironforge. It exists so that players do not waste 1 hour trying to tap a mob for a quest.
---
If there are enough players ready for Phase 2, it means that Layering is not needed any more.
---
They might re-introduce it though for limited events, like the Naxxramas Invasions or the opening of AQ gates.
---
This is very good advice.
---
I didn't realise the client would be available even if creation isn't. I'll set up my add-ons, bindings etc then. Thanks for the help.
---
&gt; 10k pop has stuff respawning almost instantly. It's hard to quest in a cave without stuff respawning on top of you
---
So since it's not the same thing it will be fine, like when wow launched and it didn't make everyone not play the game. You're complaining the mobs spawn on pservers but ignore that it's slower in vanilla. You're flip flopping hard now
---
Yeah I can't imagine Alliance beating WF totems.
---
Yeah we still don't know how they will treat server caps and layering. Will be interesting to see how it plays out.
---
I thought more about Cyborg Cats but tiny Cats would Work too I think

**Phase 1 (Classic Launch)**

* Onyxia

**Phase 2**

* Dire Maul

* Azuregos

&gt; You can't expect a raid of people trying their damnest to push every little point of damage, to accept someone playing a meme spec, getting a ***free*** ride. 
---
So... what is the cost of raiding? Are you saying that choosing an optimal class and spec is a cost? Seems to me that the only people who get a free ride are the people who don't put in the time to prepare for raids. 
---
What about an officer who spends 5-10 hours per week managing the guild so that others have the opportunity to raid without worrying about scheduling or spreadsheets? His contribution doesn't matter if he plays ret paladin? Or the guy who is just really charismatic that makes raids fun for people, but he plays elemental shaman. 
---
You can't boil down a player's worth to just their character's raw numbers. These are *people.* There are intangible benefits that are present in any organized group of people. Your reasoning would make a lot more sense if the whole raid was manned by cold, unfeeling AI, but it isn't.
---
&gt; Nobody should have to put in more work towards a raid, than the worst/slackerestest player in your team. 
---
I don't understand how picking a particular class and spec makes you the "worst" or a "slacker". In my experience, the people who play suboptimal specs work much harder than say, frost mages. Ret paladins have to farm melee *and* sp consumables to maximize their DPS, while being the slowest class.
---
No we’re not. Transmog sucks big fucking dick
---
I'm very confident we'll see some level of advertising, though probably not TV ads.
---
Was supposed to start this Thursday but delayed indefinitely. As far as I know no updated date yet
---
Imagine if we could get this FOV on a regular 16:9 27" monitor 😭
---
I *believe* you'll do the creation via the client rather than just reserving names in a browser. Could be wrong.
---
order corn
---
If they swap away from nightfall at any time, the raid is worse off damagewise, so that would be as silly as hunters going melee.
---
Your argument that because they -can- swap, they should get prio, in that vein fury warriors should also get prio, since they -can- swap to a 2h.
---
Same as enh/ret it's a major dps downgrade, but that was your argument.
---
I'm against giving people prio on gear they wont use in a raid, at that point it becomes off-raid/pvp/fun items that's up for grabs for anyone who can use them.
---
I find prot palas even more unbearable in dungeons as a healer, because they drink more than I do, so we end up just jumping around while waiting for the pala to move on.
---
In raids they're at least usually decked out in consumables to last through boss fights, but that's not the case in random strat runs.
---
Ugh, I will be such a bad hunter. I played one up to 85 in Cata, but never had to practice my kiting or CC skills during my leveling and raiding. 
---
Gotta practice a lot I guess. Do you think people will expect every player to be top notch nowadays or lenient (as long as you don't cause wipes)?

---
Get a good look people. No joke, this is the direct result of having 8 thousand WoW Classic “content creators” making countless Top 5 Lists and “Best Duo Leveling Group Composition” and “Top Professions for Goldmaking” videos every hour.
---
You have a guy who’s barely ever played the game before (OP) full of fucking anxiety and self doubt lmao. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with minmaxing guides, but rather all of the WoW Classic posts and guides and videos are absolutely overwhelming particularly for a new player.
---
OP is discrediting a fucking class because “soulshards”. Mind you, he has never created a soul shard in his life. I just want to point out the results of the internet in 2019. OP - there’s no perfect class or profession. That’s what makes the game fun. You play a class enough and it enjoy it, and soon enough it’ll start to feel perfect to you.
---
Naxx will 100% CERTAINLY be cleared day 1. Maybe not on every server, but certainly by the top 5 world first guilds. 
---
Full AQ40+ gear with World Buffs, Flasks, perfect rotations, max TPS tanks, etc will certainly provide more than enough DPS for gearchecks like Patchwerk, and none of the fights are even remotely hard compared to say Mythic Tomb of Sargeras - which was cleared by a lot more than .01% of the Legion community.
---
Well you're entitled to your WRONG opinion.
---
Honestly wtf is wrong with Transmog? If anything it would be better in classic because there are a lot of simple sets like Steel Plate and Scarlet Chain Mail that could help people avoid looking like they raided a salvation army donation bin.
---
As I've said plenty of times before, many rets/enhance will not use Nightfall primarily. When will you understand that? It's not as silly as hunters going melee. Nightfall is a completely different playstyle, which focuses more on supporting the raid not only with the debuff, but also cleansing and healing over going for personal. Guess what, many who want to raid as ret or enh don't want to do that. They want to get the most out of their spec. Not to mention, that enhancement also isn't a very good nightfall user in the first place. 
---
People play the game to have fun, the idea of being a nightfall bot, who deliberately gimps their dps to help out the casters is not fun to many. Sure, there will be times when Nightfall is used, when progression is tight and you need those extra couple raid dps nightfall provides, but many will use other weapons even on progression. Not to mention, that Nightfall, as I've said plenty of times before, does not exist until phase 3. So, you have absolutely zero argument for any mc weapons, as the "meme specs" can hardly go to nightfall, when it doesn't exist.
---
And I also said, if you want prio on 2h weapons, then raid with a 2h weapon. Nobody will rip your head off for going 2h fury. People may rip your head off for arms, due to the useless debuffs you bring, but 2h fury is absolutely fair game. Even then, you can likely find a decent raid as arms who doesn't mind.
---
I don't know how big that room is but having the pc exhaust to the corner is going to make it pretty warm in there after a few hours.
---
As far as I understand, there is not hard limit to the number of layers a server could have.  I am sure if it got to some ridiculous number, blizz would step in, open a new server, and have people transfer off.  But I don't foresee us having layering AND any meaningfully long queues at the same time.
---
After Phase 2 when layering goes away...well we'll have to wait and see how tot population settles...
---
flip flopping? you said pservers showed 10k pop is easily done (because they use non blizzlike respawn rates)
---
Lol huh... no totally wrong, it's a salv versus wf, and wf is going to win everyime.
---
It really isnt much of a problem anymore, you can trade the item for up to 2h, from what I have read here.
---
Or you could just have another mage, who can slow by 75% and do damage at the same time.
---
Sorry, but a Hunter in an AoE farm group is a waste of a spot.
---
yep, this.  Either they do BC or they'll be doing fresh servers.
---
1. If you roll need on something you cannot equip.
---
2. If you roll need on something that is empirically worse than what you have.
---
3. If you roll need on something with no intent of equipping or using it (IE, you rolled need to sell). There is a button with a picture of gold conveniently included for rolling on something that you want to sell. 
---
If a blue or epic BoE drops, I ask if anyone actually needs it. If no one does I then tell everyone to roll need so that no one can ninja. If someone actually does need it, sometimes I'll roll need on it to give ninjas less odds- if I won it then I would give it to the person who actually needed it.
---
At least 1-3 hours a night during the week after work and 5-8 hours on weekends for about half a year. So yeah  i played a lot.. :D
---
Why so hostile about a word? It’s a placeholder for the sake of convenience. It expresses an idea that is easy to understand. That is the whole point of language. Gaming has it’s own lexicon, and skill cap and skill floor are part of it and are widely used.
---
About mastery of the past and the present, I asked this before but no one responded. Can you explain how you feel players today have mastered the game or a class in a way people hadn’t by the end of vanilla? Examples would be great!
---
If anyone wants to address this I would be glad for your comments.
---
Aren’t these posts becoming just as common? Ironic if you ask me
---
Nobody is going to stop me from RPing no matter what type of server I'm on.  I'll give a rousing speech in bear form and growl my expectations to my raid.
---
Yes. They will enforce queues if that's what it comes to, but Ion has already confirmed that layering is guaranteed to be gone by phase 2.
---
Having more than 1 world boss up at once destroys the integrity of the game.
---
I'm in a similar spot. We have a 1 year old and my wife is a stay at home mom, so when I get home from work I hang out with the little guy and try to give her a break. She goes to bed with him around 9 typically, so I'll be playing from 9-12 most nights probably. 5-6 hours of sleep, then back to work.
---
Nightfall is P3 (Patch 1.6). End of Story ;)
---
And you said those spawn rates are too fast, yet complain vanilla was too slow. Which is it?
---
Most of the youtubers just pump out shitty clickbaity “top 10 x” lists that they found after  5 sec on google. By a coincidence all of their videos happen to be just over 10 minutes long &lt;.&lt;
---
The curve
---
Dps is ultimately limited by your tanks threat. WF increases your tanks threat but it's also buffing every melee dps by a greater amount. Melees will need to be consciously aware of WF procs pushing them over the tank and will need to constantly be holding back. Alliance gets flat threat reduction thanks to blessing of salvation. This alone is enough to push alliance way ahead of horde. It's not even close. Not to mention human warriors.
---
I mean, it's not really an even third split. I'd say it's 2/3 need, 1/3 greed. The "division" is whether to need everything or just valuable stuff.
---
I went the other way and am trying to recreate the true Classic experience and then some. Tiny 13.3" @ 1080p here! Now I won't be tempted to play more than a few hours at once, Haha.
---
To me, a large monitor would only bring out the many flaws of Vanilla graphics as well. But I know most would disagree that smaller is better!
---
That's mostly UBRS/5-man gear that you're seeing, so I'd say about 20+ runs on average if everyone is grouping together in a "1 of each class" fashion and not rolling against one another.
---
Who the hell thinks that when there are 5 of these exact posts a day...
---
It's like Rogues have a move that makes them vanish or something
---
Wow, that's even worse than the system my guild used. I hated it because unless you colluded, you never knew who was bidding on what, so you just had to guess what to put on a bid.
---
I remember I ended up saving my DKP for several weeks and when Nelth's Tear finally dropped, I bid the maximum possible DKP (2k) on it. I think someone else bid 1.8k, which was all they had too.
---
It's a stupid system that negatively impacts the guild as a whole, since a lot of useful upgrades get passed on because you want to save to ensure you get that one amazing item.
---
&gt;  good way of looking at "hybrids" is to frame it that you are "raid/party support" 
---
This is so cringe that if my eyes rolled any harder I'd have a seizure.
---
No clue what you are talking about, I never complained vanilla spawn rates are too slow? they are perfect for the desired pop.
---
Shut the fuck retard
---
I'm moving to Canada next year and I still don't know for sure if I'll play on EU or NA. Let's say both :) so I'm looking forward a diacord invitation please
---
Wha?
---
&gt; After Phase 2 when layering goes away
---
Points to the thread title.

Not a lot of English speakers I see.
---
&gt;so wide that it gives your ~~emersion~~ **erection** instead.
---
FTFY
---
Well idk what you consider loot council because our guild on p servers MC-Aq40 used it in combination with rolls and everyone loved it. For example each class breaks up into their own tiers officer included but they are all treated the same depending on the item. 
---
Something pretty common? They all roll. something we don’t usually see?(Mage class trinket BWL) then the top 4-5 mages that are core get to roll and maybe even more depending on the situation( officer judges) . 
---
Which imo is why a dynamic loot council and roll system is best cause the situation is always changing. Plus it adds to moral. When done correctly it encourages people to really try and shine so they can always get a chance to roll, or even earn there turn for a really sought after item they truly deserved.( someone who’s always donating to guild bank ect.)
---
I'm big on MadSeasonShow. He's a bit monotone, and even jabs himself for it sometimes. But his content is straight forward, and entertaining to me.
---
How big is the monitor exactly? My 13.3" laptop is 1920x1080, so what's the difference in pixel density?
---
while I support the idea of rppvp, just to clarify that replies is probably the worst way to measure how much support the idea has.
---
SoR was never intended to do this according to Kevin Jordan. Hope it still does it in Classic.
---
Sappy/KT are jokes compared to four horsemen. You don't even need frost resist if your decked out in AQ bis.
---
Riveting retort!
---
Monkeynews. A person does not just want to join a hype train like the rest, but is a really skilled player
---
Ha! Yea good attempt at rationalizing, but 12 years of logs beg to differ.
---
24/7 fishing stream
---
If it's too slow for 10k then you're complaining it's too slow. Even though Kevin Jordan himself talked about how mobs spawn faster the faster they die, which in a full starter zone will be dying near instantly.
---
Check any top parse from pservers
---
Prot paladin leveling may only be good as a duo leveling setup.  A warlock or druid can both add additional reflected damage (imp's fire shield and druid thorns) which coupled with retribution aura and Blessing of Sanctuary adds up to quite a lot of extra damage, and is predicted to be a very viable means of duo leveling.
---
Solo prot though....not so much.
---
A semi afk rogue that jumps in when he can play if better then no rogue. Many guilds will love having socials that join when needed and they can. I am confident there will be guilds that raids 10pm-1am wednesday/saturday, or atleast so that you can join in a hour late. While that wont give you any kind of priority you can with no doubt at all clear all content in due time.
---
Seriously. Feral tank needs to be removed from these conversations already.
---
How much dat is?
---
For classic to be as successful as OSRS it requiers new content tho. And it doesnt seem like they will do this.
---
Just search classic wow on youtube plenty will come up Frostadamus, staysafe, madseasonshow, there is a couple good ones.
---
10/10 would watch
---
Will Classic wow support that resolution? If so I might give it a thought
---

10k pop is not blizzlike? servers will be capped at ~3k. Yes when mobs are dying fast they will respawn faster, but not nearly as fast as what we seen on private servers. 10k pop is not sustainable with blizzlike rates.
---
A bunch of the people replying in this thread obviously
---
Once again sir 12 years of logs say diffrently, and as a matter of fact vanguard just shattered the speed run records this year. I mean this isn't really debatable, unless they are changing mechanics in classic.
---
not really, 15% is a common number for 45second icd trinkets and procs.
---
would not surprise me in the slightest if this was the same story here.
---
I'd like an Florry/Arumba esq wow stream, where the point of the stream is to theorycraft and explore the minutiae of the game. I am mostly into turn-based and real-time strategy games and I look at wow in the same way, so I really think I would enjoy a "strategy" WoW Classic stream.
---
yeah, nice I didn't notice them
---
I love that my class arguably has the most badass armor sets in the game, class fantasy of being defenders of justice and hard ass demon killing machines. But on raid night, I’m in a dress and a fucking tiara to make 39 other people happy.
---
Because it’s very clear your a troll or are simply retarded. No one wants transmog in classic how dumb are you
---
I don't have a problem with streamers, personally. Of the beta streamers I watched, Joana was the chillest time, Madseason was a hoot and also a very chill time, and on the second to last day of the beta I found Defcamp/Melederon's stream which was a riot and also very informative. Lastly, Payo is nuts but he is a dedicated fisherman/cook/mat grinder ingame and if you saw his face the moment the beta shut down you saw a guy who really loves classic wow.
---
&gt;The feral could have also not been geared correctly
---
They were both BIS. Using flasks and consumes. Specced properly. Still being smacked way harder than warriors.
---
They have stated they would if there is will, and while its far from everyone a large chunk of people want new content in vanilla classic
---
Nobbel87 if you're into lore. Not exactly classic specific but still WoW.
---
Wowhead was 5 months old when Vanilla ended and it doesn't keep track of item changes, just the final versions, so of course it's not going to have the data you're looking for.
---
It's skipped in levelling guides, because well, it's not that useful.
---
Sotc itself is utter crap, when it works normally, as you do around 80% dmg 40% faster. It'S easily beaten by SoC and SoR.
---
Judgment is a ncie damage boost, but for most fights oyu are better off judging SoR or SoC directly, because it takes a while for jotc to outdamage this initla application. And if fights lasts long enough for jotc to be worth it, you generally want wisdom or light on the mob for sustain.
---
It's a dps judgement for bosses. It's good in 5 mans and questinoable in raids, as it really only helps ret palas and smite priests and the raid can benefit very much from wisdom or light instead.
---
Beta was US but I’m OCE and has the same latency on the beta as I do on the pservers
---
Haven't received anything
---
not only is that potentially worse than merging, giving players more control over which server they move to, that's not guaranteed to work to spread out populations anyway
---
I was responding to your assertion that sub-optimal specs get a "free ride". That's just wrong. The cost that everyone pays is time. You can't directly compare an optimal spec's raid contribution to a sub-optimal spec's, e.g., frost mage vs. ret paladin. 
---
Its not a free ride, because the actual cost of raiding is time. It takes much less time for a mage to raid optimally, for his class, than it does for a ret pally to raid optimally. 
---
So, if you have a ret paladin hitting 99% of her potential, given the gear and consumables available to her, she's earning her spot. If you have a mage hitting 75% of his potential, he's probably out-damaging the paladin still, but I'd argue that he's done less work to earn his raid spot.
---
Saying that hybrid DPS players get a free ride is just not right, when they often have to work much harder to secure a raid spot.
---
I wanna watch Terry Cruz play a Gnome Warrior. Make that happen.
---
They've lied in the past. No reason to believe them when they done things like ignore all beta feedback for BFA.
---
&gt; 10k pop is not blizzlike, servers will be capped at ~3k
---
Layering isn't blizzlike either, well technically it is but it's not 'vanillalike'.
---
&gt; nearly as fast as what we see on private servers
---
But you said that's too fast so what is the actual problem?
---
Also who is to say they have to have the exact same spawn rate formula as a private server? Don't act like it couldn't be more than standard but less than private servers
---
and your going to sap him while hes in combat then? you realise he can vanish if your sap does not go off in the gouge?
---
You aren't forced to play shit, be 60 with 0/0 in all professions of you want, you'll still be able to play the game.
---
Totems only apply to your group, not the whole raid.
---
MadSeasonShow
---
P3, meaning phase 3 right? Meaning we can't get it right away?
---
Lol 6+ on streamer servers easily.
---
If you're feeling particularly evil, you could sell them Underwater breathing for 1-2g.
---
A max TPS warrior with WF will be fine in terms of holding threat and pushing raid DPS
---
No
---
One with interesting and new information that doesn't yell or sound like a game show host.
---
Imagine listing hunters as meme specs, whilst theyre needed for dispells, one of the best CC's that works on practically everything, can kite anything it wants to.
---
Their damage might not be through the roof, but nothing comes close to warriors buffed by windfury totems anyway, later on ignite mages.
---
Just cuz something doesnt do damage doesnt compare to #1 damage doesnt mean theyre a meme.
---
Shit like enhance, yes. obviously thats a meme cuz they cant use stormstrike as it takes a debuff slot.
---
And the totem effect nodes are taken by resto shamans anyway so they take away a raid slot that couldve been used by that instead.
---
Shadow, same thing as hunter, shadow weaving is pretty damn good later on when warlocks get their hit cap.
---
Terry Crews getting coached by Henry Caville in how to play WoW live on stream? Yes please!
---
Everyone should have that option. Do you have an active subscription? It’s the only thing I could think of but I doubt that it matters
---
I’d reinstall the launcher
---
&gt; rag dead in 8
---
8 hours maybe
---
Yes and?  You seem to forget that layering WILL go away at phase 2, regardless of server population.
---

---
Love it.
---
The talent says gain 40 energy when you shift to cat form. There’s a limiter that is assumed and that is mana. Mana cost of shifting in classic is exorbitant and if the designers intended you to shift every third or fourth global they would have lowered the mana cost or added a note to the tooltip that says “make sure to macro in mana pot every third shift”.
---
There is no other mechanic in the game that less intuitive than powershifting. It is a unique mechanic and is totally different in feel than anything else blizz has designed and is, quite frankly a terrible mechanic that any decent designer would have redrawn. So, it’s an anomaly which makes it seem like a goof, but not an exploit. This is why, I would guess they are leaving it in. 
---
You’ve never played a Druid, have you?
---
I am not really into watching streams i did watch staysafe during the beta though because unfortunately i could not play in the beta and he was playing gnome Warlock same as i am planning.  I did enjoy his stream but once the games in front of me i see no reason to watch streamers anymore.
---
It's fixed.
---
undead?
---
Madseasonshow when I wanna chill.  Asmond/Quin69 when I want to laugh. Cdew/Venruki when I want to see some pvp.
---
The funny thing is, even if sotc was just a straight up 40% haste buff without any ap increase or dmg decrease, it would still be fairly meh.
---
Honestly I think, sotc should be reworked to just be a single rank seal, which is straight 40% haste on use and a percentage based holy dmg debuff akin to shadow weaving when judged.
---
Most private servers seem to have increased spawn rates in starting areas and dynamic spawning, which Classic will not have
---
Basically yeah, which on it's own wouldn't be a problem, but from WoW history trade chat has been spammed with it in nasty contexts. Just easier this way.
---
Not hassling anyone, just genuinely curious; 
---
I really enjoyed BC, and still am not exactly satisfied with my exploration/completion of it, but dropped out of the  game a little after Lich king was released (returning later for cata).
---
...
---
What is the... PURPOSE of Wow classic?
---
Its not graphically updated (which is a missed opportunity)...
---
its more limited....
---
....
---
whats the ....point? I dun geddit.
---
Already fixed, chill out bro.
---
Madseasonshow
---
Yes. https://itemization.info/item/19169
---
P3 will most likely hit somewhere between January and April 2020.
---
No invisibility cloak on combat, though.
---
You are still better of with sor for nightfall. As Sor means double proc chance, while sotc is only +40%.
---
Madseason is great. His videos are wonderful!
---
Same.... I truly honestly never thought they would do it. Glad I was proved wrong.
---
If Blizzard hadn't forced Tranq Shot mechanics into progression raiding, Hunters would not be brought to raids. That makes them a meme.
---
And you don't need a Shadow Priest pretending to do DPS for Shadow Weaving, just have a healer do it.
---
Amen.
---
For downranking I wouldn't use a guide. It's more of an experience-thing.
---
You'll see what damage people usually take and just pick a rank that heals a little less than that.
---
I think that going for the rank that is mathematically the most mana-efficient is not even ideal in most scenarios for the following reason:
---
Let's say you have 3 priests healing the tank. On average he takes 1 k dmg/second. Now all 3 of them could constantly spam a 340 hp/s downranked heal.
---
But that also means they are not doing anything else. They never get out of the 5-second rule, they heal noone else, they don't provide wand-damage.
---
You might aswell have one priest healing with max-rank till he is almost oom and then have someone else take over. The others only jump in to buffer damage-spikes while they stay out of the 5-second-rule, reg mana and otherwise add some dps by wanding.
---
Especially for priests with their high-spirit-conversion and their itemization that provides tons of spirit the mana saved from downranking often can't compete with the mana regenerated from taking breaks and having someone else take over.
---
So in my opinion: Downranking to avoid overhealing is totally fine. But downranking so you can spam a low-hps/high-hpm-heal all the time instead of making use of your spirit is a bit questionable.
---
Show me a time where they made a hard promise and went back on it. Did you even watch the interview where Ion stated this?
---
Skarm is pretty good for warrior (and sometimes Druid) tanking stuff.
---
I second this.
---
Well, one less whiner I guess.
---
Unpopular opinion: excitement and nostalgia has ruined the game for many people already, even though the game hasn't "released" yet. The more excited and nostalgic you are, the harder your dreams and expectations will be crushed.
---
Hey bys! Would love to play with some other newfies. Send a message and we can talk sometime
---
The 2nd gouge will not have DR since the first sap will have reset it
---
&gt; I ALWAYS thanked my druid for the innervate after the pull. I guess pservers have people who are entitled or aren't thankful? 
---
It's not that people are unthankful on pservers. It's more the case that these kinds of things are to be expected. You don't praise a priest for healing, or a tank for taunting. There's nothing "above and beyond" about innervating an oom healer.
---
&gt;truly deserved
---
You deserve the item for showing up and helping your guild meaningfully in the raid context. The whole "pay the guild bank for exclusive rights to role on Drake Fang Talisman" is nothing short of bribery.
---
But I agree, in a perfect world where nobody ever left guilds, or missed a raid, or got in an officer's big black book for saying some dumb shit in gchat or whatever, then yeah, loot council is perfect.
---
But the world isn't perfect. People are gonna gquit. People are gonna miss raids. People are not gonna have 12 hours of free time per day to farm fucking Mongoose Elixirs for the guildbank (\*wink wink\* officers) *on top* of their own consumables.
---
And in an imperfect world, DKP means that you will *always, eventually* be paid back for your work. At some point you're guaranteed to get that Drake Fang Talisman. Or Asjre'Thul. Or Bone Reaver's Edge og whatever you want.
---
It didn't ruin vanilla, it has always been in the game.... why would it ruin classic?
---
Not sure where you get this from but 2H reck is easy lvling, and deep prot is even easier. Once you grab holy shield you pull 3-4 mobs at a time and burn them all down.
---
Yeah ok buddy
---
Just want to add that you CAN force Reck procs from /sit strafing in Classic. Drakova put up some videos from beta about it.
---
In phase 1?  Who knows.  But once Dire Maul comes out, that'll be the spot.
---

In the beta you could. Back in vanilla you could not.
---
Ah, odd that he quoted the others if that is the one that concerned him... but yeah that one is obviously off.
---
Nice band name
---
God enh shaman are such trash though. Elemental are better with the right gear, on short fights anyway. And they're still not better than a mage or wl, with requiring 200% the effort/consumable farming.
---
&gt;I've never tried to stream close to 24 hours in one sitting, I've never really managed to stay awake that long in general and really wonder how difficult it will be to remain mentally sharp throughout my event.
---
You're going to hate this. Don't do this to yourself.
---
Stream a lot if you want, but don't set such a rigorous schedule. Take time to just play on your own, take time to go outside, take time to stand up and stretch for 5-10 minutes every 60-90 minutes.
---
Please see my earlier comment.
---
Reality TV style streamer. Like  Big Brother, or Real world. Tune in for the drama, what's gonna happen tomorrow when so and so reacts to X
---
I'm always amazed how polarized the comments in these posts are.  There definitely are a lot of min-max this, most efficient that, etc. posts, but the second you point out that there are other options, people take it as a personal attack.  For those offended - you don't see this guy attacking people on their BiS list threads, do you?  Chill out.
---
That said, if you're going to be no-lifing it (I will too), be sure to drink a decent amount of water with your mountain dew, and go outside for a few minutes each day.  See you at 60.
---
You are a dumbass
---
&gt; As I've said plenty of times before, many rets/enhance will not use Nightfall primarily. When will you understand that?  
---
If they do, they're gimping the raid, voiding the reason they're even in the raid in the first place.  
---
&gt; Nightfall is a completely different playstyle, which focuses more on supporting the raid not only with the debuff, but also cleansing and healing over going for personal. Guess what, many who want to raid as ret or enh don't want to do that.  
---
what the player want doesn't matter when it comes to creating an efficient raid group. Or creating reward/incentives for your raiders to do "better".
---
&gt; enhancement also isn't a very good nightfall user in the first place 
---
all the more reason to go resto for raiding.
---
&gt; People play the game to have fun 
---
There is many ways to have fun. I love arms pvp. But i accept that to get good arms gear, i need to do well in raids, and to do well in raids i need to be fury. I need to find a guild that can kill the bosses in a reasonable time to maximize the amount of loot per week, which all increases my chances of gearing up for pvp.  
---
I find it unreasonable to expect that i could just go arms or 2h fury, and expect guilds to throw gear consumeables and pvp gear prio after me, just because i choose to play a gimped spec. Over all the other people in the guild actually sacrificing their pvp specs to play raid specs.  
---
I wouldn't want to be in a guild that doesn't reward people going above and beyond for the raids success. And allowing memespecs is part of that. I realise i probably cant get it exactly as i want, which is why my original concern is memespecs forcing me to either play suboptimally, or straight up lose the chance to get pvp gear.
---
This is what happened to me back in original vanilla.
---
Always envious about what their class could, always rerolling.
---
My plan is that this time I actually stick with one class and make some progress!
---
But... hng... I already feel the appeal of the other classes... must resist!
---
The good thing is that for every 10-20 new players that comes and takes a hit of the classic crackpipe, one will get addicted like the rest of us. I'm sure millions will try it out for a month or two, so we will get thousands and thousands staying.
---
I can't wait.
---
fuck multiboxers
---
I know hunters are great for soloing it, but would there be an ideal comp for running it quickly as 5? 2 druids and 3 rogues?
---
You can do it in the beta.
---
&lt;Meme Dream Team&gt; sounds better.
---
Shield with fast one handed and fiery enchant or similar...? I don’t know if haste positively effects proc per minute equations, but if so, perhaps this could be decent with a two handler with crusader. 
---
I don’t recall using it for anything other than training weapon skill but I never made it to 60 on pal.
---
lol
---
Nice, i played on emerald dream in vanilla as a ne priest. I was in the guild fallout if that means anything to you :)
---
Sure. I was just being more general where armour and sta would help when tanking. If 1v1 certainly str and agi. Where a warrior without self heal probably would want more sustain for less downtime between mobs.
---
I did a 36 hr charity event, and my #1 tip is to take 30 second mini-breaks to stand and move when you can, starting earlier than you feel like you need do (granted, we weren't streaming, but I think your viewers can forgive 30 seconds while you're on a flightpath). After a while, your legs just feel heavy and weird.
---
For ergonomics, make sure your monitor is at the right height. I had two chairs, and that worked well for me: one traditional office chair, and one kneeling chair. Switching between the two helped relieve some areas that were getting sore.
---
Reducing the ambient light in the room can help reduce eye strain. We also reduced the brightness of our monitors slightly and changed the color balance to have less blue, and had eye drops handy. I'm not sure how much this helped, but that was the common wisdom, at least. I didn't have problems with eye strain.
---
After 24 hrs I was a babbling idiot, and I wasn't putting in effort to be entertaining on a stream for the prior 24 hrs, so there's that. We ended up taking short naps so that we weren't drooling zombies.
---
Best of luck and an early happy birthday!
---
No im not a noob I already know what the classes do, thanks.
---
I played on dragonmaw EU alliance.
---
I remember seeing huge amounts of reck/ret paladins and feral druids its not like they werent played, they were however almost always rocking pvp gear.
---
Shockadins could be seen later while the above were still in the same gear.
---
All paladins I personally knew either went holy to get into raids, were left in IF because they refused to heal or simply rerolld because they couldnt get into raids as dps.
---
I remember seeing more paladin pvp videos than any other class.
---
Ive been on a p server recently and see many people trying retri/reck and are suprised, I try to tell them that they will most likely never get the gear theyre using unless they heal.
---
Im not trying to bring anyone down Im just afraid theyll all be left in IF because theyre stubborn.
---
Another thing which is unrelated, I saw a huge amount of locks and hunters towards the end of vanilla.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Cdew when I want to see 4 dogs driving him crazy while he tries to theorycraft his dualing match ups. The ultimate family man stream with 4 dogs, 2 cats, a little dew, and his old lady all chilling together.

You typically judge Sotc since SOJ essentially is 2 swings for most proc effects
---
Start of BWL phase, if all the members who got geared out leave and form a new guild
---
But swords are BiS for rogues, not daggers. Esoecially human rogue.
---
Its actually not
---
he's mad that someone camped him with 5 toons.
---
Blizzard almost always purposely goes out of their way to not make a hard promise one way or another especially when talking about future plans. 
---
When they make a hard promise like this they don't go back on it.
---
You don't have to believe them, it's whatever, but you are objectively perpetuating a conspiracy theory (IE the tinfoil hat). Blizzard has outright stated this wont be a thing. If you don't believe it, you belive in the conspiracy they are lieing.
---
Why he is little? Maybe because he is a kid, or maybe because some people don't grow that tall. What does his length have to do with it ?
---
You can copy keybindings from BfA retail over to Classic - worked for me with the beta client, so it should work on launch aswell.
---
Addons are a different topic however. You can create a sandbox to make your "own server", but I'd advise against this since some ppl were already banned for using the sandbox tool.
---
I don't want anyone who voted 2 or 3 in my group or want to be in theirs.
---
"You can only have your upgrades if I can't sell them" lmao
---
He was not prepared
---
I have no problem with streamers, there are just several streamers that somehow annoy me. It isn't about content as much as personality. Like how you might be friends with someone and it doesn't matter what exactly you do when you hang out, you just have fun. Other people would be annoying even during your favourite activities.
---
I don't particularly enjoy personalities like Asmongold or TipsOut. I do enjoy BellularGaming, Taliesin and MadSkillzz. Weirdly enough, I do enjoy Sodapoppin, probably because he is sufficiently "I don't give a shit, fuck PCness" for me. I do realize all I mentioned are not streamers, but it's just to point out personalities.
---
Further proof that vegans are dorks.
---
Good luck maintaining a fury warrior corps if you hand all the swords to Rogues because of 2-5% dps increase :)
---
I don't think that at all.  I've been playing on private servers practicing leveling routes and have played them extensively in the past.  I know exactly what I'm getting into and am still extremely hyped.
---
I second this one. Been watching a ton of kargoz duo speed levelling over the last couple weeks.
---
Cool man, thanks.
---
The only reason i burned out back in vanilla was because we struggled on the same boss and weeks of wiping and wiping without much progress kills your fun very fast.
---
I enjoyed levelling as fast as i could back then and even though i plan on taking it a bit easier this time around i just cant help to get to max level because to me thats where you first can start working on your character properly.
---
Started with a dwarf warrior. By the time i reached lvl 6 i had died so Many times that all my gear was broken. Didn't Know i could repair so deleted the character and started over thinking it was some hardcore, only have one try, kinda game.
---
I cant tell what you have "maximized" exactly...
---
Come hang out with the community ! Your welcome to play the game how you choose
---
Fuck no. Only in 5 mans where they belong.
---
Haha come on
---
I wonder how many people you've gotten to try that. I just did.
---
The Burning Drusade
---
I love all the misinformation that people have about feral Druids and ret paladins. People make it seem like they do 25% of the damage as the tanks. Truth be told, any half decent player will be ahead of half the DPS lol.
---
yikes i'd return that in a heartbeat.
---
Well then ill put it here. I would like to introduce Bourbon Raiders. We are a casual family-oriented guild recruiting for classic. Our guild website is: bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.com. if interested you can contact me on here or on discord: Algammon#1375.

That is what he meant, but I disagree with him.
---
Clever, what about the password?
---
fellow fem-orc rogue reporting in!
---
First two twinks will also be warrior and mage, although Orc warrior and troll mage
---
You think you have, but you haven’t
---
It kinda changes daily, even though I'd love to bust out my old name and character for this adventure, playing a mage would be a new experience that I wanted to have back then but never really had the time.
---
Most likely it's going to be a mage, but we'll see once Classic starts up if I have a more definitive answer.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Slowest loading screen ever
---
Atm we have access to multiple guilds for members to check out when classic launches but we do plan on running a Canadian community guild on both sides
---
I'm well aware of what you think you're doing. Again I bow out. You have soundly owned the libs, Blizzard, and SJWs with LOGIC and FACTS. You're a real hero my friend.
---
His videos are pretty funny
---
They'll be exactly the same as Vanilla, but different from private servers. Even in Vanilla end game warriors were king of DPS on most fights.
---
Break up with her
---
She must really love you
---
Who knows.  I've been using dual monitors since before WotLK launch.
---
Hey! Add me on discord
---
Ah yes, the suppression room, good point. You'd probably have to bring a rogue or two for disarming to make this not hell on earth. You could probably do it without as bubble + freedom would allow people to run through quite well, but this'll take a lot of time and is quite dangerous as you can only use isntant heals.
---
But this just a requirement due to one specific mechanic. You'll also likely need a hunter on bosses where tranq shot is required.
---
Don't know what you mean by egg room. Razorgore? There is nothing, which would stop a raid of off specs there.
---

---
&gt;What will be the highest rank attained during phase 2
---
It depends on how long phase 2 is. It's impossible to reach rank 14 in less than 3 months.
---
You realise the spell power pally is dead right. Your shit dont proc off SoR
---
Why would anyone care about knowing Hindi? Discusting laungauge of the ugliest people on the planet. Now I get why you're so mad. It's your tiny little hindi dick. Smallest dicks in the whole world. Lol
---
Don't trust private servers to get the mechanics right. That's coming from someone who's played on PS for a long time.

Here come the people who use these as their entire vocabulary. Trigger warning.
---
Go away.
---
I’m stating my opinion. If you feel strongly about power leveling there is little I can say that will change your mind, and that’s fine.
---
The first time I around, I rarely did professions until close to the end. I think skinning (and first aid but thats a given) was the only one I committed to while leveling. I had 3 70s when I quit but I was determined to level a hunter someday and gave up every time, just couldn't get into the feel of it.
---
See? You're more sensitive
---
That's interesting, how do you know?
---
I just picked up an LG34GK950G myself, super happy with it and I can't wait to play Classic on it!!
---
What monitor is this?  Looks like the 41/42 inch one I was looking at.
---
You need an LED strip on the top of your desk.. maybe underneath as well... mood lighting yo.
---
This is really interesting. I was going to roll Priest. What are you seeing for most needed classes?
---
Whatever you decide on don't level as daggers. That said if you want to PvP, Combat is not great for that.
---
Druid one is the most active despite the class being the least played, I always found that interesting.
---
I plan on having one alt to have a back up for when i get bored or im getting ganked.
---
But, he confirmed with a Blizzard CSR that it was fine to use.  After confirming it and doing it at launch, he got banned.
---
Its like if the company you work for needed you to travel to another city to attend training. They agree to pay for your train fair to get to the other city, to attend the training. But they refuse to pay for your train fair to come home. Coming home is optional, right? Just stay in the other city. 
---
Thats what they're getting at.
---
Just do it in transit on flights and stuff, thanks when I used to tweak mine. The default is fine at low level
---
You realize they have plenty of data that was obsolete and no longer in game by there time wowhead went live, right? They are a data repository first and foremost. And you know, of course, that people in the comments regularly refer to the past status of an object because iterative changes always draw comment and scrutiny, right?
---
Joana?
---
I've gone through 5-6 Nagas over the years. the quality is bad... don't buy razer. currently using corsair scimitar.
---
&gt;No one talked about it before it was brought up in the Classic Beta
---
I am not for or against it, at least for now. But about people **complaining** that in classic beta is way **more noticeable** than in vanilla/pservers... obviusly they could no say that before classic beta. You can't talk about something that doesn't exist yet.
---
If melee characters get a mechanic to help with positioning due to connection lag then I think point blank spell casts need some compensation as well. So frustrating winding up a frostbolt only to have the enemy step 0.5 feet behind you and the entire cast time is moot.
---
There was a lotus mafia on private servers... I ran it for a while
---
You're going to die. Open World PVP is a thing in Vanilla. All the Horde and Alliance all lvl/quest in the same zones from lvl 20 onwards all the way to 60. The higher you get, the worse it gets. You will get ganked. You will get camped. You will take res sickness and rage log. It happens.
---
Literally the ONLY thing you can do, is rush to get to 60 ASAP. The sooner you get to 60 the faster you won't have to deal with lvl 50's camping you in STV while you're trying to kill fucking tigers.
---
&gt;I will eat dogshit if Method take wf Rag

How are you watching wow content in prison and does the governor know the cook’s boyfriend is an inmate?
---
It would be useful to know if you want to do a quick clear so you can leave all the bosses unlooted until the end. So much time is wasted by a lot of guilds on distributing loot.
---
Length has everything to do with it unless you know how to move it...  But as for the vertically challenged.. hmm, don't know.  =)
---
Wow.... and looks like you have the smallest brain of all people, if you fell for this one...
---
Is that an old school Palm Pilot in the middle of it?
---
Personally, I welcomed transmogging when they added it to the game but over time I realized that an MMORPG is probably better off without it.
---
It's a good thing for people to be able to tell how strong you are by the look of your character.
---
I think it also gives designers an incentive to keep pushing themselves. I know some people will disagree here but, to me, the visual quality of sets noticeably declined in WoW over time.
---
Also, this is just me but I always hated it when people purposefully made themselves look as stupid or ugly as possible just because the system allows for it. Your character's appearance should reflect their power and status and I think transmogging conflicts with that.
---
If you want to focus on PVP instead of raiding I'd recommend hemo ([21/3/27](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheoRxzZhZVMe0cGRo)) because it's not gear dependent and you'll be fine with non-raid gear. You'll need a sword/mace for your main hand though.
---
Rolling Rogue, profs matter. Grabbing herbalism for my rogue mats and leveling alchemy for heal pots and maxing that early to get my daily cds will grant me more money and utility.
---
Heres the thing, constructive criticism has been provided and OP says " Its based off this website take it up with them".  He has no intention of changing the list or thinking critically about items at all. The guy above is right. This list is riddled with errors and ppl should not use it.
---
Layering is temporary
---
You only need 1 player with quintessence
---
The significant difference is all the information about efficient leveling is out there. I can see a lot of people burning out trying to go as fast as possible. I’m glad you decided to go easy.
---
Really? It shows as 3.1GB for me
---
Surprisingly, we are short quality mages and rogues.
---
Not many druids either but the ones we have are pretty committed so shouldn't be issues there.
---
It also seems common that if people are committing to paladin levelling they are going rather hardcore at the end which makes sense given the levelling process to gain their strength.
---
I didn’t have a sub and I was able to download it.
---
Someone made this argument with me once and said IMP totems bring an additional 23 dps to your totems for each player. They said if the rogue is doing 1000dps and you're doing 550 then the actual dps you're bringing is around 642 which is still about 40% less than other DPS. This is why shamans get such a bad rep for raiding.
---
The thing is, most raids(all of them) don't need everyone doing 1000 dps and this is where people who only look at dps meters fail.  It creates the "well if I want to down it faster why would I bring a shaman over a rogue or war?" which is their prerogative. However, MOST guilds are not looking to MINMAX everything and will be fine with a shaman DPS'n. This creates the, play what you want argument.
---
Yeah I was in a pretty hardcore guild people who think raiding in WoW = nolifing have no idea.  Evercrack made just getting max level a 2nd job.
---
How do I know what?
---
That mobs have leeway that wasn't in actual vanilla?
---
1. Watching Classic footage
---
2. Remembering the dozens and dozens of hours I spent AoEing in vanilla, as well as watching old Mage kiting videos that clearly show them not being hit from 8+ yards when kiting.
---
Melee is just harder to multi cause of positioning.
---
No one cares you pompous windbag.
---
Yeah man, I totally agree! I think it's even fine to be of the opinion that leeway should be updated to reflect current infrastructure. But there are so many people, even in this very thread, that say "leeway did not exist in vanilla" ... it's just stupid.
---
They can turn off layering with 2 full layers worth of players on a server. Those players will mostly be leveling and spread out in different zones. This is not a problem while people are leveling and there is not the same hardware limitation that existed in vanilla that would have prevented this back then.
---
not in the beta
---
Joana aka furiouspaul, the maker of the infamous guide. He streamed his hunter leveling a few hours a night during the beta, practising his speed theories and getting back into the groove of things.
---
hunter2
---
No, do not wait a few days.  Log in and enjoy the mass of people that you will see, as long as layering is working correctly.  It is not something you see in retail anymore.  That's what I am going to do.  I don't care if I can't get that simple beginner quest done, nope, it is going to be nice seeing everyone.  Being in that community.
---
I like StaySafe. Dude's chill &amp; based
---
&gt;Hnoestly, I really don't get what you are raving on about.  
---
&gt;You sound like a person, who doesn't want to raid with offspecs
---
it does sound like you get what i'm raving about :) i've been trying to justify my position of being concerned that memespecs will take prio on pvp gear, which you've only enforced.  
---
The rest of the discussion is you arguing that memespecs should be allowed and have prio on gear because of fun, and me trying to argue that "memefun" doesn't make for a strategy that kill bosses efficiently, nor does it incentivize players to perform well in raids. So to me, the argument of "fun" does not sound like a very good one.  
---
&gt; You don't gimp the raid by playing ret or 2h fury. 
---
in the same way you dont gimp the raid by showing up without consumeables and enchants, or a raid spec.  
---
&gt; The raid loses perhaps 1% total dps, 
---
i would look up the numbers, but looking at the logs of Esfands raid a few weeks ago, being just above the tanks and way at the top, is significantly more than 1% of total raid dps. This matters for healer mana, this matters for killing adds before they become a problem, this matters when killing bosses.
---
Well played you son of a bitch.
---
Don’t get discouraged with these guys.  From a proven psych standpoint, they have a need to bring others down to their level.  Just be wary of the salt in this community.
---
There's very few things that an hybrid dps can do that they can't do with a viable spec.  
---
For example, a enh Shaman have a slightly better WF totem, and that's it.
---
divegrass?
---
World Cup, Summer Olympics and Christmas every year surely have more PTO requests than classic wow.
---
That makes sense about paladins. Thanks for the reply. I think I'll still roll with priest. I plan on more casual raiding. Hopefully it will be possible to find a guild! I wasn't able to raid the first time around, pretty excited to finally experience it.
---
How do you explain Nathanos then?
---
couldn't be possible if blizzard didn't allow it
---
&gt; it does sound like you get what i'm raving about :) 
---
No, you are projecting a problem, which isn't there. There are many guilds, which won't use offspecs at all. Find one of those and be happy there instead of thinking about non existing offspecs taking "your" pvp-gear.
---
&gt; i would look up the numbers, but looking at the logs of Esfands raid a few weeks ago
---
Let's say, you bring 25 dps each doing on average 1000 dps. That's 25000 raid dps. Now you replace one of those with an offspec which deals 500-700dps, let's say 600. Raiddps is now 24600. A net loss of 1.6%. When does this matter? Pretty much never. Especially, when the raid dps requirement to beat even naxx fights is around 10-12k.
---
Also great idea to use one persons single raid log as a guideline. A single death and all your world buffs are gone and you are far behind. Just as silly as expecting fury warriors in naxx to do on average beyond 1000 dps. Most numbers from pservers are simply not representative for classic. Esepcially ret paladin logs, as there barely are any. And finally the gap widens with better gear. On mc level, there is barely any difference. Naxx gear is a big factor in creating this large gap, so it also won't be that large on progression raids.
---
Thanks for the explanation, I'll stick to caching the T3 set :)
---
Tier 0 is garbage though lol. The caster sets only get a small amount of spell power from the set bonuses.
---
Hell, there's a set that drops in Scholomance called Necropile that is cloth, roughly the same level and gives spell power on most of its pieces.
---
Can you help me understand how the two events of "you watching classic wow content" and "your girlfriend bringing you what's on this picture" are related?
---
Was this the first time she made food for you and her explanation of what made her do it was that she wanted to reward you for watching classic wow content?
---
Ouch, no chance of recovering it? I had to send a photo of my passport to Blizzard but they gave me access to my account after about 24hrs.
---
Avoid tipsout ...at all costs

🤦🏼‍♀️
---
It is 1440p by 5120 I believe
---
Apart from already mentioned MadSeason:
---
Frostadamus - Great goldfarming vids
---
Kargoz - not many vids lately, just boring streams. But his old vids are good
---
Punkrat - lots of pserver shenanigans and tryhard crap, but some good content too
---
Skarmtank - again lots of pserver crap, but some good points, mostly tanking, both warrior and bear
---
That's a shame but fair enough
---
I think some people are trying to figure out if it makes sense to alternate Seal casts in between swings. So in theory you've got a slow weapon (3.5 speed), you swing with Righteousness or Command for the on-hit proc, then you cast seal of Crusader to speed up the swing timer and right before you swing, you recast Righteousness or Command for the on-hit proc again. I think they call it "seal twisting" but I haven't heard much about it since the beta.
---
why would Warlocks be especially attractive for alliance? since they would be worse for pvp imo (because of the UD racial)

Fellow fellow-fem-orc rogue reporting in!

Just coping Esfand over here nbd

That's what I'm doing! I'll probably end up healing a bunch still, though.

Not sure why soulshards are such a dealbreaker iv never found it to be a very oppressive mechanic on warlocks.
---
It is basically only really used for its judgment
---
This art installation wasn't more than $40. What monitor are you going to buy for that?

Almost like people don't know what google is anymore.

I feel like tech departments in corporates are gonna be very confused.
---
“Why is half of IT on annual leave???”
---
That's funny because if you're saying that you're most likely a normie too.
---
I agree with you if you are implying that lotus will be more scarce. Flask prices will be insane. The tears will flow.
---
This seems like the only workable solution to me. Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Yea, it would be cool if we gamed in a world of "everyone nicely greeds while the one guy who can use it needs", but the reality is that the potential reward for ninja'ing a BoE blue or purple is so high, it makes even decent people do mean things.
---
Getting more philosophical, the reason BoP blues are "greed unless you need" is that the ~70s or ~2g anyone would get from vendoring an unwanted BoP item is so obviously less valuable than the potential upgrade it gives to the one player who needs it. The math is so simple it isn't worth discussing. 
---
With BoE blues, the math is much different. In most cases I've seen, BoE blues tend to drop from content slightly higher level than the min required to equip. So lvl 29 BoEs are dropping from SM or RFD, while the group members are in their upper 30s. This makes the math much more complicated...is the BoE a sidegrade, which is likely to be replaced in a few levels...probably. Is the value of that sidegrade greater than or even equivalent to the gold some crazy 29 twink would pay for it in the AH? Almost certainly not. So what is the popular solution? Let everyone roll and sell it to the highest twink bidder to fund our fledgling professions and/or mounts? No, it's to force the one guy for which it's a sidegrade to equip it in the instance, ensuring that no one gains any meaningful benefit from the item and it gets vendored a few levels later for 70s. Sure, it would be great if the community were Noble enough to say "man, that would have been a great upgrade for me 6 levels ago, but I don't actually need it now, so I'll greed". That certainly happens sometimes, I've certainly seen it, but I think the "everyone need" solution is much less likely to lead to frustrating outcomes.
---
&gt;Always Need all BoE, ask if you if you want to take or buy from winner
---
Fucking spare me. I really hope people only need if they actually need the item. If nobody needs it, then everyone would be selecting Greed... that is the whole point!
---
I see debuff slots brought up all the time, what kind of debuffs went in there? I always hear there weren’t enough spots for DoTs but are there really that many more than like curse of elements, shadow weaving, sunder &amp; FF? How does anyone determine who is supposed to get debuff priority
---
I hope but they I bet they rather new players join BFA because its much more profitable for them.
---
"Maybe Woodstock" lol.....
---
Night Elf Warrior reporting in!
---
is it FailZ? (s)he is also nice
---
You seem to forget Horde has Tranquil Air Totem.
---
Two melee groups:  
---
Rogues in the tank group since they have Vanish and Feint. This group has a shaman weaving WF and Grace. 
---
Second group focuses warriors, and weaves WF/Tranquil Air, until it's safe to go Grace.
---
Granted, TA only reduces threat by 20% compared to BoS' 30%, but this again is offset by Rogues.
---
Also, for every druid in your raid you can reset aggro on a Warrior by suicide and CR.
---
Feel free to wear gear with shit stats bro no one is gonna stop you
---
Haha I guess its how you look at it really, I usually remember guys who help me more so than the ones that fuck me up, I remember back from my second account a guy helped me out then a few weeks later or so I ended up helping out a lower level which turnt out to be his alt, he remembered after he had thanked me and I explained about being helped a few weeks ago, pay it forward type of deal, haha yeah I noticed someone downvoted one of mine, seems pointless sometimes haha
---
There's lots of decent solo grind spots out in the world but they don't scale that well because of mob density. Most of the valuable trade goods are sourced from dungeons, so that's where you'll make most of your money.
---
DM east jump run is one of the most consistent gold farm for a group of two or three players but it's not available until phase 2. Stratholme live side has the highest potential profit margin but righteous orb drops are random and prices fluctuate from server to server.
---
For a group of 5 my money is on DM north. With some practice you can run 5 per hour and the only part that gets tricky is Captain Kromcrush, but you can build your group around dealing with him easily enough by just having enough permanent CC like polymorph.
---
When your microphone is almost as big as your monitor.
---
Most people who watch streams do both.
---
Leveling an auto attacking pally is not the most engaging thing in the world.
---
Plenty of time to watch stuff on the second monitor.
---
Still you take the time to reply. You gotta enjoy being annoyed.
---
There isn’t any. That was a mistake.
---
Brother!
---
Your first 7 talents should be put into Affliction tree with Improved Corruption (makes this an instant cast dot) and Improved Drain Soul (by now your lvl 16). From lvl 16 onwards, put everything into Demonology tree, focusing on Improved Void Walker (you'll never use any other demon while leveling).
---
Improved Drain Souls is HUGE for leveling Warlocks. Everytime it kills something you get +100% increased mana regen and +50% mana regen while casting for 10 seconds. This means you'll rarely need to life tap, and will never, ever oom. You can chain pull from mob, to mob, to mob, to mob. Very fast, efficient leveling.
---
The problem is, every time you kill something with Improved Drain Soul you get a soul shard. While you'll want to keep about 3-4 Soul Shards in your bags at all times while questing/leveling, you don't want 100+ taking up each bag slot (in Vanilla, Soul Shards don't stack, and each one takes up 1 bag slot).
---
So you need to make a macro that every time you use IDS, it instantly deletes/removes the soul-shard it makes. Then you keep 2 IDS's on your bars; one for when you need Soul Shards, and one w/ your macro for basic rotation.
---
With IDS and your macro set up, by lvl 16 your full rotation from 16 onwards is as follows;
---
Shadowbolt to pull, Courruption, Wand AA until mob is about 10% hp, IDS until it dies. Your goal is to get the IDS mana buff from every single mob, every single time. Always use Voidwalker.
---
Shadowbolt, Corruption, Wand, Drain Soul. Rinse, repeat. Over and Over and Over until 60.
---
You can pull multiple mobs by putting Corruption and Curse of Agony on 2-3 mobs at once, Fearing, having your void walker tank 2 while you tank one, and wand/drain life them down. Only use CoA for niche situations such as the above, or for elites/high HP mobs. CoA is a mana sinking and not worth it for your normal rotation.
---
Not after a couple months of release. Tourists are going to be gone

Hi, /u/Badger9001

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cgt5io/what_will_be_the_most_contested_names_the_day/). 
---
Even if its just for those crazy moments like kiting the dragon to Stormwind and killing everyone, there are some great things that have come from his Beta Twitch stream. I second the recommendation, but I don't think he'll be making any new Classic content until launch so its somewhat limited.
---
Dkp is the only way. 
---
Without dkp guilds are going to break up around aq from loot drama or lose their best players to guilds that have dkp.
---
Doesn’t matter if I get tired of looking at the same set it’s besides the point. Transmog is fucking stupid and has no place in classic or wow in general
---
&gt; has connection issues
---
Yea but shit happens. Being prepared is the boy scout way.
---
Not being the best at something while still requiring *all* the gear
---
Only because it looks like shit. If it were steak and grilled potatoes with a world of warcraft cup in the background it'd be on the front page.
---
Why does this questionnaire assume group loot will be used? Not a single raid pug ran with anything but master loot on private servers. The items are linked in chat and people who want them roll for them. It is very common for BoEs to be reserved by the raidleader as payment for organizing and running the raid.
---
I was under the impression that this was MC gear.. either way for what it’s worth I think the dungeon sets look cool. 
---
Sounds like getting these sets of gear will be really easy so that’s good too.
---
1. They aren't going to tell you as that will make it easier for people to get away with it.
---
2. Probably same thing they did back in the day.
---
3. Phasing
---
4. If needed
---
They won't be able to in some cases I'd say. I mean, what if the top populated server still needs 3-4 layers by phase 2? They have no option but to keep it enabled. It'll be too late to try and make some new technology or whatever. Or gigantic queues.
---
The add-ons that exist for actual 1.12 might be completely different from the ones that the classic client uses.

About Us:
---
&lt;PUG United&gt; is led by Classic veterans (Excellent references available upon request) who know that the true mark of original WoW was the community. In keeping with this, we are a social guild that plans to tackle every drop of content classic has to offer. We aim to replicate and surpass previous triumphs and enjoy our time doing so. We will always be focused on building the kind of community and camaraderie that is the very best of what WoW and MMORPGs have to offer.
---
Our Classic Goals:
---
The guild is led by Classic WoW experienced players. This includes a Raid Leader who downed both C’Thun and KT before Burning Crusade launched. We plan to do the same in Classic. We will down all content from Molten Core &amp; Onynia to Naxxramas. We will also have a heavy PvP focus from battlegrounds to WPvP with members looking to hit rank 14 again.
---
Expectations:
---
Firstly, show up with a positive attitude and a helpful hand for your fellow guild members. Secondly, there is a time and a place for everything. When it is time to raid be ready to raid. Show up with an understanding of your Class/Role/Optimal Spec. We do expect our raiders to have some understanding of each raid but are always happy and ready to teach. Thirdly, exhibit a desire to push content and a willingness to learn. Teams build each other up not tear them down.
---
Schedule:
---
As of this moment this guild is voting to solidify raid days. Frontrunners are Tuesday/Thursday/Friday/Saturday.  We will be raiding mostly evenings from 6/7:00 PM – 10:00 PM EST. We plan to be more flexible on days as we understand that you have other demands on your time. Your time is valuable, and we treat it that way.
---
Loot System:
---
Here at &lt;PUG United&gt; we will be implementing a Zero-Sum DKP system. Simply put, we find loot council to be nonsense for anything short of a Legendary. If there is an item you want, save your DKP. Priority will be given to Main vs. Off spec.
---
Class Needs:
---
Currently, we are still in an open recruitment phase with a priority to healers. We plan to be a home for all. Do you wish to bind your Hearthstone?
---
/follow and hope for the best
---
oozepriest, kargoz, madseasonshow are all good. Frostradaumus too
---
Send it back and demand the potato looking things are at least arranged to complete the heart shape.
---
....boe greens aren't that big of a deal so if someone needs it they have the option to roll need to use it. the argument doesn't fall apart at all.
---
Yeah you're probably right, the 12 year olds following asmongold and sodapoppin are for sure not gonna want to play on the same server as them...
---
&gt;but my post is more geared toward people thinking power leveling is mandatory in order to not miss out on the advantages of being among the X first players to ding 60.
---
This is social pressure. The community is telling people you need to race to 60 otherwise all the good gold making opportunities for example. All the feeling of missing out is coming from the community. That is social pressure.
---
Can you imagine the shit show if come phase 2 we have layering AND queues?
---

should call it softball because they are all a bunch of diving pussies
---
No, it annoys me on other subs, too. Not to the point of being upset, angry, etc., but simply there's nothing particularly exciting about clicking on a post, reading it, and seeing that it's the same question that has already been answered quite often.
---
I'd like to add, I say "annoyed" pretty lightly - it's more than I'm hoping for more interesting questions to pop up so I can also learn something new, rather than seeing a question I already know the answer to.
---
Yes but winter night doesn't require farming for a pattern from live Strath.
---
I always do mining/engi on my hunter and it's always funny to me playing one because it's the only time I hotkey the button for a profession tracking skill.  
---
I love having a pet. Other than warlocks, you're the only class who doesn't need to panic when an add spawns and aggros you. You can freeze trap, or you can just outright tank the extra mob(s). You also don't need to drink mana after pulls (mage) because you can literally just autoshot/let your pet attack on most mobs and kill them still pretty efficiently.  
---
I don't have a TON of time to play, so hopping on as a hunter and knocking out a couple levels in a few hours because of my solo-ability makes it far easier.  
---
Spending lots of time choosing the pet you want is super fun to me. Here's the list where you can find all the cosmetic differences:  [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/)  (though, unfortunately for variety, basically cats are the best pet followed closely by boars/owls. Wolves are mandatory for raids. and you only have 3 pet slots, and you have to keep one open until 60 to be able to tame animals for skills)
---
Same! I even have an excel file with WoWhead dressing room screenshots of their faces and settings. I'm seriously running out of things to do to prepare.
---
You have the druids sleep spell, which can take out all of the dragonkin adds.
---
On horde side you can use earthbinding totem for kiting. On alliance you can use the ret paladins stun and repentance to keep mobs somewhat cced (though you basically need 5 ret palas to cc one mob permanently). Priests have fear and mind control.
---
Iirc correctly, the adds also like to go after razorgore when he destroys eggs, so depending on how much your tanks can handle, you can also let some adds just wail away on him. I'd probably go with a strategy of letting the melee adds go at razorgore, kill the mages and cc the dragonkin. Then figure out from there what needs to be done to get through phase 1.
---
So as example:
---
A Lvl 22 twink pulls tones of Lvl 25-30mobs and a mage aoe killing all, without beeing in Group?
---
Just a "best guess" really since I stopped using my VR.  There's an app on steam called "big screen beta" that lets you see your desktop screens while wearing the VR headset.  I'd imagine you could just play wow this way.
---
Good point, it's a pretty unrealistic addition anyways

The fuck does this have to do with WoW: Classic?
---
Yea, that's not really a reasonable idea.
---
I know that in at least one raid I saw a boss despawn with loot on it. 
---
It's not something that happens in 5 minutes or anything but thinking you can "come back for it later" is not gonna happen.
---
2h fury is shit and enhancement is worse.
---
Do it - wow classic won't be better than it's first month.
---
Better I'm every way.
---
He got banned for something else, I think.
---
You don't need to be the master looter, anyone can trade it
---
As I said: for as long as I've played this game. People who needed an epic, if you had the good fortune of it dropping, got it. They equipped it. If nobody NEEDED it, it'd get rolled and pad someone's gold nicely afterwards. Good on either of those people, if I didn't win.
---
Now, IF you, as a feral, needed on that Warden Staff and nobody ever sees you using it from thereon after, you basically ninja'd that item out of greed, not need and were treated no different than any other ninja looter: as a persona non grata.
---
People say they are looking forward to reputation meaning something, but the whole point of that was that you'd have to extent a certain amount of trust to people. Example: when you gave someone mats to craft something, they can easily fuck you over royally, but that's where consequences USED TO BE in place.
---
People scoffed at the "blacklist" thing when Soda brought it up on his stream, but that's how it was back then (at least on my server). If you are a notorious dickweed, nobody will want to be associated with you.
---
I liked that, personally. Sure, you might have lost an epic here and there (can't recall actually if it ever happened) but it also meant integrity was worth something.
---
&gt; which is 100% when they are removing layering. 
---
Read the threads title and come back to me
---
While I'll never be able to play a female Character, the Orc vs. UD Rogue is still such a hard decision... Looks vs. Stun Resist
---
Honestly, this is how I see it happening.  I feel in 2 weeks, layers are going to be gone and we'll just be on server queues.  This is just to combat initial game launch rush, because classic (while it was successful) only launched with a few hundred thousand people?  We're likely to see a million+ on the release of classic, so the servers are going to get hammered.  They also know there will be a population drop off, so they want to try and keep server choices limited to avoid dead servers.
---
That happened in vanilla.  So I guess it's a true #blizzlike experience
---
It's like complaining someone has more time than you do so that's not fair. 
---
And there's definetly skill involved in coordinating multiple characters at the same time. What percieved advantage do they get? I mean if it's anything that can be purchased with gold, playing the AH is more profitable and less effort and financially cheaper. Anything else and the benefits are on 1 character so it's moot. Nothing stops you grouping with 4 friends to do any group content, or multiboxing yourself.
---
I'm okay with this. Fun is fun
---
It is different factors all together.
---
The mana cost is increased. Spell batching makes it so that the Mobs are sometimes all the way through your Blizzard but don't get slowed right until they are almost in your face.
---
Blizzard damage is less.
---
There was something else I'm not 100% certain of. I think it was to do with leeway that Mobs actually had slightly increased ranged compared to private Servers.
---
All that together makes for a pretty large nerf sadly :3
---
Loot trading is in for raids. You can just have your ML loot everything and disperse it at the end.
---
Wow, I only see \*\*\*\*\*\*.
---
ahhhh - tiny little clockwork cats would be dope.
---
I mean, horde side, not even an issue really.
---
Thanks for the link, but this is very confusing!

---
What are the advantages?

Nah, I like to stick to one character

Except it doesn't, in Classic Beta.

---
Did it work?
---
You’re grossly overestimating how many people are actually going to play Classic WoW.  Even if we go ultra aggressive and say they have 15M play at launch, the amount of people requesting time off for the event isn’t going to come close to requests related to major sporting events, specific holidays, or even just old fashioned family summer vacations at your typical company.
---
This\^ I want a no streamers allowed server. People can circlejerk to that exaggerated chipmunk faced douche asmongold all they want just do it somewher away from me.
---
Met dutchies bedoelen zij uiteraard wij superieure noorderlingen.
---
&gt; No, you are projecting a problem, which isn't there. There are many guilds, which won't use offspecs at all. Find one of those and be happy there instead of thinking about non existing offspecs taking "your" pvp-gear. 
---
I've played the game long enough to know that "semi-hardcore" guilds, is a minority, and looking at 2-3k playerbases on realms, the chances of there being such a guild on my server, speaking english, that also has the "no offspecs" attitude, is maybe 50/50, which is pretty bad odds with the only alternative being suck it up, or rerolling on another server. (Not allowing offspecs is pretty radical, given the current wow population.)  
---
&gt; Let's say, you bring 25 dps each doing on average 1000 dps. That's 25000 raid dps. Now you replace one of those with an offspec which deals 500-700dps, let's say 600. Raiddps is now 24600. A net loss of 1.6%. When does this matter? Pretty much never. Especially, when the raid dps requirement to beat even naxx fights is around 10-12k. 
---
Why does one guy get to slack, while the rest has to make up for it? If you allow memespecs and 600 dps as your baseline. Don't be surprised when everybody else drops to 700 dps because "that guy doesn't try, so why should i?"  
---
&gt; Esepcially ret paladin logs, as there barely are any.  
---
i'm looking forward to being proven wrong, but all data so far points to that not happening.
---
I'm glad there will be so many babes in Azeroth &lt;3
---
Personally I don't feel like WoW is a particularly good fit for streaming. Much of the game is monotonous grind when you're not playing it. I mean, watching good pvp or raid streams is one thing. But watching someone level in Classic? I don't see how that will make for compelling streaming. I could be dead wrong on that, of course, as opinions vary greatly.
---
Still took me 2 hrs for this Without addons https://i.imgur.com/HNCgF9E.jpg but I’m picky about keybinds and stuff
---
Why before the 10th?
---
It has a place in retail wow. How can you be the champion of the horde/alliance, the hero of everything, and be dressed like a clown? it has 0 sense rpg wise (unless you are roleplaying as that)
---
This is a great, thank you. The responses I have received are more varied than my originally posed question and I have found them to be very constructive. My goal was to a) compare engineering aoe threat generators vs. their non-eng counterparts and b) determine if there are enough situations in Phase 1 dungeons/raids that require aoe tanking so that eng would be considered a necessity for tanking.
---
Herb + Alchy for the rogue flavor man! Herb mats, potions, elixirs, and plenty left over to sell or trade with guildies. Every one of my alts is probably gonna have herbalism as well, just to fuel the rogue's crafting.
---
Why would something that happens in two months affect launch?
---
They can't.  Let's say each layer is a full server population.  Turning off layers with 2 layers active means you now have 2x the players that the world is made for.  
---
Granted, there's probably some wiggle room in layer sizes.  So let's say 3500 is max server/layer limit.  Each layer will probably have 3000 players on it.  So as the population is at 6000 players, you get 2 layers.  When it drops down to 5000 you get 2500 on each layer, 4000 goes to 2000 each layer, 3500 you merge the layers and go down to 1 layer and put in a queue.  
---
The queue will keep going up to maybe 50% of a server capacity.  So 3500 players logged in, 1500 players waiting still makes a queue.  Once the queue hits 1750, a new layer is created and then 2625 people are put on each layer.
---
Phase 1 on horde it's good.
---
Thank you for that powerful insight.
---
lul i remeber at lvl 12 i was so salty i couldnt get the pet from my trainer then i asked someone how i could get it and after i did the chain i tried to taim mobs that u cant for 4 hours 😂

Between those millions of comparisons, is it possible you could link just 1, so we can see the exact difference from pservers leeway and classic leeway?
---

Stun resist, the answer is stun resist
---
Yeah I tried it with my trip reminder setup and it was not as good as I thought. There are only a few games that are playable with triple monitors

OH you poor babies!!!
---
How many people going to rage quit after getting soloed by a mob 1 level higher than them.  I really wish the numbers were public so people could see but everyone is predicting roughly 80% dropoff within a few months.
---
Don't even remember my account name to be honest or the email I registered it.
---
I have original cd boxes lol
---
Maybe they can trace it via cs key?
---
Should be 1080 by 5120. 1440 would be too many pixels to push.
---
Iirc, loot stayed on bosses till soft reset/despawn which is way slower when unlooted. About 20-30 mins if memory serves me well.
---
Or human, depends where my friends go.

&lt;Competent Casuals&gt; | NA Server TBA | Alliance-PVE | Casual / Semi-Serious Raiding
---
ABOUT US Looking for a casual raiding guild that'll still progress, aren't up their own asses and just want to make new memories in classic with you?
---
We're a casual oriented friend/family guild that will be rolling on an alliance PVE realm. We're a raiding guild first and foremost but still plan to dabble in PvP for sure. The guild was made with adults in mind. So those that have jobs, families and a life outside of wow yet know how to bring it during the weekend and raid nights is exactly the type of person I made this guild for. Casual yet competent.
---
GOALS We're NOT in a rush to hit max level. Of course raiding is in our sights and I expect us to get going around Dec or so. Take your time, enjoy this revival of classic we've been waiting so long for but don't forget we're here to raid at some point. So be ready for that as well.
---
RAID SCHEDULE (Central Standard Time) We're thinking a mid week raid once ZG, AQ20 rolls out but for the main raid group Fridays and Saturdays are likely. We'll adjust depending on whos recruited into the guild. 2-3 hour raid nights on the weekends.
---
LOOT Right now we’re thinking a variation on DKP and Loot Council. The more you help the more gear you get but there’s going to be moments here and there where a tank should get first dibs to help the whole raid progress. Thats just an example but you get the picture. For the most part things are going to be as fair as possible. This is a promise to anyone that joins.
---
EXPECTATIONS Please check out the guild website for expectations / rules etc.
---
For more info please checkout our website https://www.competentcasuals.com/index.html Link to Discord can be found on the site. Please look over the rules first.

---
Vaelastrasz
---
The OPs question doesn't exist beyond phase 2.  They're removing layering in phase 2, full stop.  Layering is only going to exists, at the longest, in phase 1.  
---
Too many players where every other server has layering turned off?  
---
* They'll offer free server transfers to lower population servers
---
* They will remove layers and put that server to "full" status and get a queue, no new player creation is allowed on the server
---
* They will continue to layer the server until phase 2.  Once phase 2 hits, the above 2 will happen.
---
Won't happen even with layering unless you are a top tier player. Someone asking how to do it now is not one of those.
---
I, too, daydream.
---
Word on the street was that the IDS buff only procs if the damage from DS is credited with the killing blow making IDS near useless. Does anyone have solid confirmation whether this is true or if the DS debuff merely being present upon killing blow is enough to proc IDS?
---
Skill in multiboxing? lmao
---
Nothing is stopping me from cheating but playing fair.
---
Theres definitely programming skills in cheating too. So youre saying cheating is ok?
---
&gt; It's like complaining someone has more time than you do so that's not fair. 
---
???
---
Its nothing like that, not at all.
---
What do you mean? How should I use heroic strike every 30 seconds till 10 without my UI?
---
&gt; I get it, you hate layering and are going to bash any post that has any shred of support for it
---
All I'm asking is you discuss the actual topic. FFS dude
---
Well first of all it would be a bit crazy to put 10 points in disc and not putting the 11th in inner focus.
---
Then it also means giving up on mana burn talent which can be very useful for certain match-up/situation
---
So.... not sure it's the best idea
---
I raided a bit as arms back in vanilla. They just told me I should pool my rage and then dump it with slam.
---
I didn't even know why and assumed that this was more damage. :o
---
You gave me hope ty
---
SORPG
---
Blizz doesnt allow cheating and botting, but people still do it.
---
This seems like a good niche pick if you know you are going to deal with a lot of casters. You are losing out on a lot of mana efficiency which you get from doing a bit further in the disc tree. If you’re oom in a by or world PvP the %10 wont help too much. If you really want to try this though, wait til you’ve got some good gear that way you aren’t gonna oom constantly
---
You get used to dying - you really do. Its not a big deal at all. There is not consequence for getting ganked. You run back, res, drink, eat.. go again. Its not a big deal.
---
By the time you are 40, it will just feel normal.
---
I feel personally attacked.... 
---
Despite my intentions to stick to Warlock and hit 60 to fund other classes, I fully expect to spend a lot of time bouncing between alts using rested xp and will in all likelihood wind up with 2-3 classes in the 30s-40s before I ever finish something to 60. ; ;
---
See you in 2 years!
---
Yes let's talk about Trudeau
---
Damn you are right I forgot.. well auto attacking it is unti... Damn forgot that I won't have my swing timer add-on setup..
---
Well guess I'm gonna stand an hour in the starting zone setting everything up..
---
Any holiday week?  Memorial day week, 4th of July week, Labor Day week, Thanksgiving week, Christmas week?
---
This is also the week before Labor Day.  As far as my work is concerned, I'm taking a week off leading up to labor day for vacation.  It will look the same to any other employer.
---
My checklist made it ways to pick a class.
---
Can I heal? Can I tank? Great, druid's the only one for that
---
How is being able to have the strength of 5 characters instead of 1 not an advantage? Sure it's a bit more effort to move them all but there are ways to make it easier, and it's still a massive advantage that you are only getting because you are paying real life money to do it.
---
Exactly.
---
I raided in Vanilla as a Priest and was a raidleader for some time, as well as finishing Naxx before TBC came out.
---
I want to offer some insight.
---
My experience is from:
---
- a progression raid which was getting most of the server firsts and downed KT
---
- a casusal MC/BWL raid group, which I led for some time
---
- pickup AQ/ZG raids
---
- alt raids with my warrior
---
In the casual raid we were expecting people to have the optimal raid spec, because we were still learning the raids and overall we were so bad that we needed that advantage. In hindsight this led to us having all prot warriors, for some time, which was likely a mistake ;) But later they all switched, except of the main tanks.
---
Later we would also allow 1 offspec for each class, but it was not helping that much and created a lot of drama.
---
For AQ/ZG pickup raids nobody cared because we always had a few key people who outgeared the raid.
---
The alt raid was very strict about no off specs as all the people had ran the raids with their main characters and wanted to gear their alts quick and without trouble.
---
The progression raid did not allow offspecs at all.
---
Personally I liked to play Shadow Priest during PVP weekends and would farm gold for the respecc during queues. It was a lot of fun.
---
It was pretty easy to get offspec-gear, when raids were on farm. 
---
Anyway, I believe many people who believe off-specs will be allowed in raids, might be in for a rude awakening. 
---
Your arguments may convince yourself, but the problem will be convincing the other players.
---
This display is almost exactly like two of the ones you describe sitting next to one another with no bezel. It's 5120x1440, and 120Hz.
---
And, WoW: Classic is the week before Labor Day.  There are already going to be plenty of people taking time off before and after the holiday in the US.
---
Ive got every square on the default ui bound, however many that is. plus some to autorun/swap action bar
---
Nope, I made that mistake last time and this time I'm rolling one class and a bank alt. There is a very small outside chance that I might make a low level warlock just high enough to summon and have professions on. Will not be going the altaholic route again. Whatever I roll on launch day is it even if it's mostly making lemonade.
---
I would tell you but I absolutely despise multiboxers since it's basically just pay2win cheating.
---
vanilla realms got full enough that they'd open free transfers.  layered realms will need more than 1 realm to transfer to to fit all the overpopulation, assuming people actually choose to transfer
---
I too have the 49” ultra wide curved Samsung monitor. I lasted around ~2 hours before I resized that shit back to normal. Didn’t enjoy it at all. Still an amazing monitor though, I love it.

---
Tauren warrior first to level with friends, but I’ll have a troll priest as my side ho when no one is on. Then either a mage, Druid or hunter, haven’t decided which yet.
---
No one knew woodstock was going to turn out like that.
---
Fuck Monday’s though.
---
Yeah i could care less if my friends optimize. But i already told them if you dont go that route and dont get pre bis or put effort in im going to leave you in the dust on my main. Most of my friends will be extremely casual levelers. Slow enough that i could probably get 2 level 60s before they have one
---
I played a dwarf priest in classic retail I can't remember exactly what it was but it was considered a tri-spec used every tree and it was near unkillable 1v1. It wasn't very great for random BG or group play but 1v1 people knew who I was lol.
---
They said they're going to publish a server list prior to the August character creation.  They'll all be localized by time zones, so you'll have PST, MST, CST, EST servers to pick from.
---
For when youre not in front of a screen, listen to Countdown to Classic.

Common mistake is putting 5/5 shadow weave. You only need 4.
---
I up oted this because it's cool as fuck, you Alliance scum.
---
I'd suggest going 3-5 in suppression too if you are on a PvP server, it applies to fear and can be really helpful if you are being ganked by a higher lvl player. I was fearning 60s around 30 1/4th of the time. Saved my ass a couple of times, and nothing feels better than fucking over a much higher lvl player.
---
Only on private servers, as far as we know the holy damage hit won't proc things in classic
---
This whole sub-reddit is overestimating how many people are going to be poop socking min/max players.  Any casual player who starts seeing a server queue of 3 hours and is offered a free server transfer to bypass a queue will take it.

Your dedicated players will remain on that original server, so no issues there.

I've been using one on my gaming machine for the last year+, and it's pretty great. Being able to put all the things that you do want to have visible at a glance but not be in the way (quest logs and such) is nice.

I had Malowns and in starting PvP gear, Malown is just really, really bad, because you lack so much crit from pieces other than the weapon.

You want to get as much crit as possible from any source possible.

Therefore the +5% from axes is a blessing. It's the difference between 17% and 22%.

There are quite a few people grinding to r14 who just never got a Spinal Reaper or BRE, because drop rates are so bad, 6-8% (dont know which is the droprate on Classic server) can really screw you over.

Limited testing on my end so far but it looks like crusader is best for fast two handers and command for slow (&gt;3.5s).
---
Righteousness is for tanks imo.
---
See I would agree with that but you can't really Gage someone's power just from their gear in Classic unless you have extensive knowledge of each class and their BiS items + what those items look like.
---
Just because a Paladin is running at you in full T2 doesn't mean he's going to be more powerful than the Paladin running at you in a mixmatch of gear. Same goes for most classes.
---
I just genuinely don't see an issue with allowing people to make gear sets in classic. A Warrior in T2 isn't going to look anymore threatening than a Warrior in random gear pieces because chances are the mixmatch of gear pieces are probably better overall than the T2 set.
---
Not anymore. Given that 2 hour window to trade loot in raids the ML can just pick it all up and come with the raid and trade it over to whoever wins it as the raid moves.
---
its 1 action for each toon, same as playing 1 char, every multiboxer i ever met press a buton once and 5x of the same skill is casted/used.
---
Shadow priests are cancer to casters.  Back in original vanilla my shadow Priest specialized on hunting and killing casters, and used mana burn constantly as part of that process.
---
US Server - PvP/PvE - Horde or Alliance 
---
I'm located in Europe but will be playing on US servers. Looking for a guild that will raid anywhere between 1100 to 1700 EST.
---
**LOOT HOARDERS** -- EU-PVP (english) --  Alliance --  Efficient 3-day raiding 
---
**Currently we have 25-30 people who are active and interested in raiding in Classic. We're looking to fill the last spots with excellent players of (mostly) all classes.**
---
**&gt; What can you expect from us?**
---
-	Leaders and raiders with top 200 experience for numerous years
---
-	Clearing all raids within decent time of release
---
-	Non-formal guild environment with lots of memes and fun
---
-	Mature and objective leadership
---
**&gt; What do we expect from you?**
---
-	You’re passionate about Classic WoW
---
-	You know the class you’re gonna play well, or are willing to learn how to play it well (this includes consumables, enchants, knowledge of BiS etc.)
---
-	Your character is up-to-date with enchants, consumables etc.
---
-	You can accept constructive criticism and you’re not a “drama queen”
---
-	85% attendance on a monthly basis
---
**&gt; Raiding**
---
We plan to raid 3 times a week. Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday. Keep in mind that early Classic likely won’t have enough content for 3 raid days, so we’ll likely be starting out with 2 days. Time will be 19.30-23.00 CET (with invites 15-30 minutes prior to the start).
---
We aim to raid in the 3rd week after release, assuming we have ~30 people at 60 by then. We don’t have requirements for leveling speed, but we aren’t interested in people who are planning to level slowly for the journey.
---
**&gt; Loot**
---
We’ll be using loot council. There will be a lot of people voting, and we’ll strive to avoid favoring. We’re all the type of players that see loot as a tool for progression, and not a reward (despite the guild name :D)
---
**If you’re interested in joining us, either check out our application form at http://loothoarders.eu/ , join our Discord https://discord.gg/t8EW7pK, or contact Redtuzk#1111 on Discord.**
---
Comparing the Rio world cup vs. the Rio Olympics, yeah, the World Cup had more visitors, 470k vs 410k. It's a farcry from the '10x as many' though :p
---
Why is that? I've never watched his videos but I see them come up.
---
Make auto attacks lose leeway when slowed 30%+ too. ike the code implys. Fixs literally every issue on both sides
---
I honestly thought this was a throwback pic to your setup during vanilla.
---
If it wasn't clear I was mocking him. Clearly the poor guy is a victim. Whoops.
---
Because due to layering the issues you described become only issues in the second content phase.
---
I feel you. Wotlk was dope. If you got friends to play with there then keep doing your thing. Classic is gonna be crazy though, everyone’s coming back. If you want to enjoy WoW with millions of others, Classic is gonna be the way to go
---
Female Human mage, come at me bro. I was torn between female dwarf paladin and mage, but I can’t bear to auto attack my way to 60, so mage it is.
---
Every Americas server is either hosted in Los Angeles (137.221.105.2) or Chicago (24.105.62.129). There are no true East coast servers anymore.
---
But there are way better games to stream than watching someone at level 5 auto-attack a mob. 
---
I think the streaming was exceptionally popular during beta because everyone is really longing to play.
---
Yeah sorry but i wouldnt want to play with someone who doesnt even want to make there character stronger or optimize them in the slightest.
---
But as it is, there will be a home for me in a tryhard guild and a home for you in a casual guild. Nothing wrong with that just two sides of the same coin. Enjoy azeroth bro :)
---
&gt; Esfand
---
while i kinda like him,e after watching him a few tims i got fed up, half his words are DUDE and UNBELIEVABLE.
---
Agreed if you are on reddit asking what class you should make or what it's like you are probably going to be an altoholic.
---
That looks so ugly when people block the middle of the screen
---
The funniest part about this dipshit crying about multiboxing and how it's no-talent cheating (spoilers: it's not) is that this dude is more than likely terrible himself
---
This is why I got the essentially "no questions asked" best buy warranty on my keyboard.
---
MAGE:
---
Kiting, control for days, big damage, high skill gap, nice spell animations, can pvp in raid spec or vise versa, monsters in pvp, shatter.
---
To be fair, 14 years ago people's damage really sucked and threat is a massive issue now in top guilds. Salv is king when threat is the name of the game.
---
Also the items that do give +shadow resistance have ridiculous amounts of it like [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18340](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18340) (Eidolon Talisman), [https://classicdb.ch/?search=stygian](https://classicdb.ch/?search=stygian) Stygian items. 
---
Combine that with [https://classicdb.ch/?item=9036](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9036) (Magic Resistance Potion) and your +shadow resist goes through the roof.
---
No, no, if you were lagging behind in progression (be it gold, rep, etc.) because you have no time (resource) and some has time to play it's the same dealio. Sub money for time and that's the same thing. It's never going to be fair. Have a read of the article I linked.
---
How many other people are as aware as you are?
---
Well I play horde and ferals are still better tanks, great aoe threat and an actual taunt
---
To each their own. Im going for a feral tank /feral dps. The meta specs bore me i always try and play underpowered or less played specs more fun that way. But at the same time there is still a checklist of stuff you need to check off if you want to compete at the higher levels of play.
---
Which by the way is COMPLETLEY fine if you dont do so. There is nothing wrong with not getting worldbuffs or flasks or consumes etc. But at the same time temper your expectations as to what will be possible.
---
Ah, a fellow intellectual
---
Once again, talking about people on 1 server, not the total
---
That's cool. I always have a second screen for watching tv/movies though, so I wouldn't do this as it takes up too much space.
---
 LI have a Dell ultra wide for wow and a 4k with hdr support for my secondary. Which also has a 4k bluray, tivo, roku, and ps3 hooked up to it currently. The full media monitor.
---
Can someone do all my research for me because im too lazy to look things up myself even though there's ample amounts of information out there for this 15 year old game.
---
If they're ruining your day they're champs to me
---
Yes
---
On actual vanilla, I ended up with:  
---
A main, that I raided on.  
---
A level 60 alt that I did some casual content on, but really was level 60 and had some gear for the purpose of dual mining/herbalism.  
---
A couple other profession-alts that leveled high enough eventually (I think 45?) for the various transmutes, basic crafting stuff useful at 60, etc.  These characters were a very low priority.  
---
Almost everything was ultimately in the service of my main though, except that I did enjoy my primary alt (the gatherer) enough to put decent hours into her.
---
Maybe if the monitor was as tall as it is wide it would be nice.. but it looks stupid and like your only getting a fraction of the pic ... like what a dumb monitor lol
---
As a streamer they need to be chill, not an asshole, and not have an ingame posse.
---
Ideally I'd watch a rogue who does stealthy stuff just because they can (sneaking in dungeons to solo/duo/pickpocket, messing around in other cities, etc) as well as the normal fare.
---
Feeling kinda sorry for people with your problem, I know what I want to play and hit 60 with it. My problem is trying to level alts.
---
It's entirely plausible that each region (Pacific, Central, and Eastern) will only launch with one of each server type (PVP, PVE, and RP).
---
yeah... im doomed lol
---
Why did you not like AQ40 as much? Its been a while since I've been in there since I haven't raided on a pserver, but from what I recall the fights are fine, but definitely a large jump from BWL. I think Visc is the worst designed fight but its also optional. Coming from a Vanilla experience Ouro was buggy and terrible and we didn't even bother with him until after C'thun, and then I don't remember clearing him much again.
---
What is your character name going to be?  What realm will you be on?  What timeframe will you be on?  
---
These are good questions for us Horde people that you can answer for us when the time comes.  We promise to not look for you and gank you but we cannot do that unless you answer those questions.  =)
---
If you want someone to care, text your mom the link.
---
Im sure she'd love to hear your voice.
---
dps meters create the mentality that if you're doing less, you're not worth as much. simply not true. i agree with you.
---
I do have fuzzy memories of the focus cost vs damage... but that's where it ends.
---
Ya she’s currently my only follower
---
Oh wow, this is a really cool idea I hadn't thought of. Keeps the extra DPS off your pet while it runs to the new target. Thanks!
---
For Horde it's better at the time because of Windfury, on Alliance it's historically been a weird flavor-thing on how/how long to use your BRE in PvE but it's still a great weapon, especially since we'll be launching with the -2100 armor and max debuff slots. So for your chart's purposes it's definitely up there somewhere on Horde-side.
---
I wouldnt go for resist pots. They become increasingly more expensive with Nefarian in BWL, twin emps (?) and certainly C'thun tentacles later, lots and lots of Naxxramas bosses.
---
You really dont want to squander 5g on a resist pot in wPvP. I personally would consider it a lost fight if I have to pay this much to stay alive.
---
That sounds like a good stream idea
---
What do you main?
---
This guide soooo bad
---
&gt; just because you vanish does not mean your target drops combat
---
Then you CS. Like I said earlier
---
&gt; you wont have the energy for these abilities for another ~5 seconds.
---
Remember I said thistle tea. It's like you didn't even read my last post. BY the time I'm doing my 2nd CS I'm already about to 5 point evis you and it won't matter cause at that point you'll be dead.
---
How does your enormous brain fit inside your average sized head. Lol for real thanks, that should be obvious
---
I do not believe this is the case in Classic, but we'll see
---
Get a better council.  If only your council core is decked out and your raiding core is in peasant gear, your council sucks.
---
I was part of a LC for 2 years on Vanilla and then was a loot dictator (as in, I made the sole call on who got what) for another 3-after that and I never had a single person rage or gquit on me over gear.  Was I the best geared in the raid?  No.  I wasn't even the best geared for my class most of the time.  It was all about what was best for the raid as a whole, taking player skill, class performance, and attendance into consideration.  I don't care if you're a glaive rogue who transferred to my server to raid with us who tops DPS on Brutallus every time, but you only have 50% attendance, you aren't getting loot over a rogue who has 100% attendance who consistently does "only" 85% of your DPS.
---
Same theme for a healer, 75% of your casts are overheal and you call for 3 innervates and you still go OOM every right?  And you think you're getting that sweet mana regen trinket?  Yeah it's going to the guy who does triple your effective healing in half the casts, and somehow makes do with no innervate.  Oh and by the way, tell your friends we're recruiting for a new healing priest after this raid.
---
Long story short, shitty LC's are the worst, properly ran LC's are infinitely better than any other garbage system people try to cook up.
---
Beware the deadwinds ogres can't support more than 2 people farming, and even that's a stretch.
---
That's one half, up to two, standard deviations. Your definition is wrong on nearly every metric that cares about  significant differences,  which is basically every scientific and economic field we have.
---
Dude it aint rocket science or private server bullshit. You farm the gear, you farm the consumes, you farm the pummlers, you learn how to powershift if your dps, and you chug mana pots dark runes.
---
no keyboard is filthy after you've seen Payo's keyboard
---
Gnome &gt; Dwarf.
---
[Spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205300105041-3203-05025302030011).
---
Gnomish &gt; Goblin (just have an alt or friend craft sapper charges for you).
---
Orc male rogue and after hit 60 maybe a lock orc female or warrior
---
It doesn't matter what you really "need", but what other players that you HAVE to rely on think you need. Tyranny of the majority and all that.
---
&gt;Thinking "The nature of the game" is dungeons, raids and PvP competition, that's the current WoW / E-sport mentality I'm talking about.
---
That's... literally what is the nature of the game. Maybe stop and think what is there actually to do in the game if you don't do dungeons and especially raids. Dancing on the mailbox? Not to mention how absolutely outgeared you'd be in every way by people who do dungeons and raids.
---
There's too much information, it's a bloated topic and hard to find anything concise and accurate.
---
This is exactly why im playing a feral. I love having to invest more and showing up to raid days to putup numbers better than pure specs. Gear will get funneled to me ezclap
---
i will focus on only one character pvp mainly. when i see the faction i am in has way slwoer bg queue times and way less targets in wpvp i will switch faction and start from 1 again
---
alexensual
---
he's the alex jones of classic wow
---
I mean it sounds like literally anything anyone says you play devils advocate for. You are hoping people on reddit will have some magical answer from blizzard that no one has ever seen before?  
---
Its a 15 year old game man that people have been playing for years....stop worrying about servers being dead before the game is even out. You need to take a chill pill everything will be fine.
---
That doesn't make it true.  You seem to have some impression that individual layers are going to be barren at launch.  Beta was beta because there was not a lot of people and they were testing.
---
You have to play actual Classic for the addons to work. Not some shitty private server and a 15 year old client.
---
Wow that is an amazing screen!
---
If you care more about your personal progression than the guilds progression you deserve a system as shitty as DKP.
---
Then again, if your guild doesn't care about you as much as you care about it, it deserves to flounder in the lower raid tiers forever, and it will because of a constantly changing raider base when people leave after they realize the guild leadership is garbage.
---
Nah, you'd be ready if you had a sherman tank of a gateway 2000 monitor or something. You look ready for 8.3... Sad!
---
Just play a Druid.  You can heal, stealth, breathe underwater, tank, and you’re the fastest class in the game.
---
whats the size on the screen? happy playing.. would love on of these for myself
---
Gl getting groups
---
So as a druid tank you're almost a full standard deviation worse than a prot warrior?
---
fair enough
---
Because he's talking to his green screen? People before Esfand did that, too.
---
Btw if you never heard a Streamer say it: Many of the successful ones are even on this point, can't quote but I'll give you the details I remember: "We take eachothers content / techniques and evolve together as Twitch by this point."
---
It's not about being the first one to do it. It's about being entertaining and growing the community, to give more and more people the opportunity to get jobs and laughter out of this stuff I'd say.
---
jesus
---
Big sad
---
Yeah, but that means you’d have to play alliance though.  😕
---
YOU ARE BREATHTAKING!

# 💠 &lt;Hubris&gt; 💠
---
Type: Hardcore PvE &amp; PvP
---
Faction: Horde
---
Realm: PvP (EU)
---
Loot: Council / List
---
Raid Time: 19:00 - 23:00 (server time)
---
Raid Days: Mondays &amp; Thursdays (During ramp-up for world #1 race, we will add Wednesday as an extra raid day to practice on PTR)
---
# 💠 **Expectations:** 💠
---
We expect members of our Raiding Squad and PvP Squad to be competitive. In raids we expect you to always bring consumables, world buffs and a good mood. It’s not mandatory participating and ranking in PvP, but we highly encourage it.
---
# 💠 **About Hubris:** 💠
---
Everyone has their own definition of fun. Our definition is being a part of a tight-knitted community with social and good-humored individuals; who always strive to be the best but never forgets to have some fun while at it. We are looking for like-minded players who share these values.
---
The core of the guild is mostly made up of Norwegians and Swedes who came to play together on several private servers. The guild itself has been in development since early 2017. We are a light-hearted bunch who have our fun min-maxing the game and testing the limits of WoW’s mechanics and gameplay. We are ready for one final round of vanilla (yeah right...) where we will go all-out!
---
Most Hubris members played retail vanilla way back; now many of us are now pushing past 30. With age comes responsibilities in the shape of families and careers. We want to spend our days in our underwear, farming dungeons, raids and crushing the alliance. 
---
We are looking for people that shares our same state of mind. If you answer yes to any of these questions you might be Hubris material!
---
* Are you able to read through this rather long recruitment post?
---
* Are you using vacation days to play classic at launch?
---
* Do you want to rank past 12?
---
* Want to top individual logs for your class?
---
* Are you able to wake up in the middle of the night for a 10 min world boss kill, then resume your sleep?
---
* Mind clearing all 40 man raids up until phase 5 in a single raid night?
---
* Would you enjoy a drunken Zul'Gurub raid on friday nights?
---
# 💠 **Hardcore Gameplay:** 💠
---
Previous experience within Hubris include:
---
* Members being part of world 5th retail Kel’thuzad kill (in guild [Forte](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Boulderfist_Europe/Forte))
---
* Members being part of Aphorism, top 10 EU high-end guild in TBC &amp; WOTLK
---
* [Killing Hakkar in mere seconds with 52k+ ignite stack](https://youtu.be/11M--EYik_s?t=2849)
---
* Many DPS world records in RealmPlayers (private server logs) including:
---
   * Hakkar 5100 DPS
---
   * Gahz’ranka 3500 DPS
---
   * Golemagg 3400 DPS
---
* Speed-running: MC (&lt;30mins), BWL (&lt;60mins), AQ40 (&lt;60mins), Naxx (&lt;90mins)
---
* Many ex-Rank 14 PvPers, both from Retail and Private Servers
---
* 6 months of World Boss Monopoly at one of the largest private server and its successor.
---
* Ragnaros defeat within 13 days of a new PS release (which is a goal we aim to improve. This time within the first reset of retail vanilla)
---
We put a high emphasis on improving boss tactics, theorycrafting and finding the optimal raid setup. Hubris has a subsidization policy, which involve the guild bank providing members with a part of the cost. For instance members can trade a flask for the mats except the \[Black Lotus\].
---
To keep raiding from getting stale (outside of the world #1 kill races) we usually try to spice it up with speedruns, speed kills, and going for top ranks on individual DPS logs. This is a great way to keep content exciting and fun while waiting for the next patch update.
---
# 💠 **World bosses:** 💠
---
One of the most exhilarating and rewarding events of vanilla is by far contesting World Bosses. Ginormous PvP battles, mixed with great boss fights and top-notch loot and gear.
---
The GM of Hubris was one of the raid leaders and a founding member of the world boss alliance at a private server that starts with N and another that starts with A. Where we at one point in time had a monopoly on all the world bosses and their loot for close to 6 consecutive months.
---
There is a great competition killing the world bosses, and it’s hard to act alone as a guild. This is why we have made strategic alliances with other guilds for a higher chance of defeating our good friends Kazzak, Azuregos, Taerar, Ysondre, Lethon &amp; Emeriss.
---
# 💠 **PvP:** 💠
---
Most of our members aim to achieve R10 or higher, without being a part of the Ranking PvP Squad. At the moment our Ranking PvP Squad counts 18 people who will be going for R12 or higher, where 8 of them will be going all the way to R14.  
---
In **Phase 2** we will be organizing honor farming groups every day to ensure our PvP Squad’s honor farm and control of the brackets.  
---
In **Phase 3** we plan on becoming the strongest horde premade on the server, and by doing that: gaining control of the servers brackets. We do believe this is highly achievable based on our previous PvP experience and skill, in combination with having the best gear from PvE content.
---
# 💠 **Additional Information:** 💠
---
Vanilla is finally back, and we’re hardly able to keep it in our pants. We hopefully piqued your interest in some way and are looking forward to seeing you join the ranks of Hubris.
---
You really don’t need to be a hardcore player to be a vital part of the guild. You are just as welcome to join us as a social member; rake in the benefits of being in a great guild, without any of the pressure.
---
Hubris will run weekly PUG raids where socials and alts will have priority spots, they will aim to consistently clear all content in progressing phases.
---
The raids will be organized by Hubris officer Yonomori, through his [discord](https://discord.gg/SZUk4gH). You can find more information about the PUG:s and its requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNQ0lJpXeAnIeCllsBY8rt4ItKF8IvFDCQ_O1VnZlhs/edit?usp=sharing).
---
We are currently looking for one additional member of the following classes for our Hard Core Raiding Squad:
---
* 2 Mages (Troll race)
---
* 2 Rogues
---
* 1 Priest (PI or Holy spec)
---
* 2 Shamans (Resto for PvE, Ele for PvP Ranking)
---
Even if we are full on a certain class/spec ***all exceptional applications will be considered.*** 
---
We're also recruiting exceptional players for our PvP Ranking Squad!
---
Thank you for reading. It’s important for us to find the right people that fit within our group. Some would say we are setting the bar too high, but you got to have a little hubris to achieve your goals.

# 💠 **We’re looking forward to hearing from you.** 💠
---
Not like I'm gonna do much raiding.. unless it's with my friend group who knows that I know what I'm doing and doesn't care that much for "progression".
---
Thank you for the great reply! I'd like to raid at least a bit and don't enjoy healing so Mage might be the way to go.
---
I'm thinking of a warrior as an alt as my 1st love is tanking, but what I've read/watched about classic like your previous comment on this thread makes me worried as doing the slog of warrior leveling and not being able to put in the hours. I'm hyped for classic but kinda sad warrior is the only viable tank.
---
To add: Add-ons, proper healing target assignment, gold farming spots, general tips and advice, loot council distribution ( if your guild is loot council)
---
I thought crusader alone was fastest of the 3.  
---
With judgments, though, I thought righteousness was the fastest with crusader judged.
---
Command was the most bursty but less predictable.
---
Would be fine for ..........imp packs in Mc. Lol
---
Hemo ([21/3/27](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheoRxzZhZVMe0cGRo)) with a sword/mace works great with poor gear, dagger builds are weak without godly weapons. I prefer Gnomish engineering as it gives the death ray and a decent teleport location for alliance. Mining will help with engineering but if you can grind gold faster than you can grind ore you'd be better off taking herbalism - herbs tend to make more money on the AH.
---
On private servers I was often 2nd priest in DM, Scholo and Strat runs - not to even mention the druid and shaman healers in there needing the same items. In world chat you would constantly see priests spamming LFG for these instances.
---
Again, far from being a "private server problem", I believe this is going to be WORSE in Classic. It's mostly caused by changed attitudes.
---
I just wish people would stop spreading false information about there being some kind of lack of priests or healers - because it's absolutely not the case, and if you're considering at all between a healer and a tank, we can approximate 25% (25% of population when 20% are needed) too many healers whereas we have a 25% too few tanks (15% when 20% are needed). Those are big discrepancies - possibly even game/meta changing..
---
because of threat management and other things i will go full shadow. 0/3/48 its a question of playstily how to skill.
---
I am the same. Had a win paladin and my highest alt was level 6 lol. Just used them for banking and that was it
---
In vanilla when people weren't great and specs were bad? Ragnaros, Vael, Nef, and C'thun were roadblocks at the time. Rag people needed to beat the second sons coming out. Vael was a race against all of your tanks eating burning adrenaline. Nef you needed to keep the draconids under control in p1 (of the list this is the weakest I think). C'thun you had to keep tentacles under control and get solid damage in the stomach, and during the weakened phases, I think most guilds did it in 2, maybe 3?
---
Ok? Care to explain?
---
Nah, you need to look at it from a more abstract point of view. 35 days, but of those 35, realistically 23 days are actual working days. We wont count weekends because weekends go by in a breeze; as soon as you come home Friday evening and bang!, you're already walkin' out Monday morning to work.
---
And of those 23 days, we can subtract this whole week because, well, you've already made it this far into the week. Then we can continue subtracting the last week before launch, because by then, the hype would be numbing almost all your senses, and your mind will be so busy trying to get ready, making sure you've got all your shit straight, all the groceries gotten, all the wives divorced and all the bosses lied to.
---
So, in actual matter-of-fact, we're looking at a mere **NINE** days before you're stuck to your chair for all eternity, devoting the rest of your life to your fantasy alternative life in Azeroth.

You might read this and think oh wow jolly gosh I bet this guy's on some serious drugs, but really, this way of thinking has gotten me through life so far and it's been a literal breeze. I am no a slave of time; rather, I control time in my own way that suits my life best. I can snap my fingers and it'll already be Christmas.
---
Try it out, don't fear time. *Embrace it.*
---
Lol let’s hear it then 😂😂😂
---
Sounds like you check all the boxes I'm looking for. I've been in family friendly guilds and I've been in edgy teenager guilds...both types suck for entirely different reasons. If I can say "fuck" and "tits" with impunity but not have to worry about obnoxious, aggressive dickheads...I'm happy.
---
Only thing I'm worried about is time zones. I'm in Alberta. Are you all east-coasters?

It's with BRE however which is notoriously overpowered with about 95DPS as long as you maintain the 3stacks of armour reduction.
---
This seems terrible
---
This is really freaking awesome!
---
Seriously, if you think about selling some of these send me a PM and take my money.
---
All you need is a monitor that isnt 8 feet wide
---
I'm planning on getting skinning for only 10 levels or so, for a little bit of extra cash. Then dropping it for my crafting profession to craft some things that might be useful while leveling (most likely going blacksmithing)
---
I think you’re confused
---
I wasn't referring to difficulty.
---
So many dicks
---
I like human rogue with combat sword spec, especially for leveling and non-twink pvp.  Skinning/leatherworking is pretty good since it will help replace old gear faster than just dungeon/quest rewards (unless you're following a strict gearing guide and skipping a lot of quests).  
---
Engineering is good, and if you're serious about PVP then you will want to get it at some point.  However, I don't think engineering is *as big* of a game changer for rogues in regular wpvp while leveling.  You can avoid conflict pretty easily when you want to, and you don't need engineering to successfully win fights.  
---
I don't really believe in using consumables in BGs unless it's a premade / for the purpose of farming HKs for pvp ranks.  Waste of gold IMO, especially while leveling, so picking up engineering early game will definitely slow you down.  You will also have to get mining to support engineering since it will be very hard to just buy your way through when the economy is new and there isn't surplus low level materials (an assumption I make because most people will be using those mats on their professions).
---
Only playing classic to be a hand of rag wielding tauren enhance shaman.
---
Not having instant corruption **severely** gimps you in pvp and kiting situations in pve as well. Could you make it work? Ofcourse. But in my opinion this is just theorycrafting bullshit in an optimal situation.
---
You still need to equip it for the achievement, so you can't get it on your shaman regardless
---
Overhealing isn't bad necessarily, running out of Mana is bad. I don't care how much a player overheals as long as they don't go oom. Better to overheal and use extra Mana than have a tank die to back to back crushing blows and have a full bar.
---
Well ran loot council's are amazing. They require a few things: mature leadership, transparency, buy-in. 
---
That's it. People who are "bribed" for pixels or don't share the wealth outside of the officer circle aren't cut out to lead anyway and the guild is doomed. Similarly, if it's not transparent and people aren't bought in then the guild was doomed. 
---
Truth is, as long as the guild is solid and there's mutual respect and trust then loot council is the best system. If those things don't exist, then the guild has bigger fish to fry.
---
That's one weird ass build.
---
For PVP? If you want to roll a priest in any sort of pve you need meditation 3/3.
---
Ah, got it! Forgot that they changed the music...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Don't let all your officers only run groups with other officers or top raiders. Encourage raiders/officers to run lower geared people in other content such as 5 mans and make sure you do so yourself.
---
This is real solid advice. I would push it further : don't let your guild being fragmented into small group of people. Organize guild wide events sometimes (like world PVP on a contested area, BGs, etc)
---
I was probably 13 at the time, played a human warrior. Leveled with a 1h and shield until the mid 30s. Took forever....
---
Class lead != Guild lead
---
Class leaders just make sure people bring reagents, consumables, and don't fuck up.  It's easier for 8 people to bitch to 4 people under them than the raid leader to bitch at 39 people.  Class lead is about delegation more than anything else.  It's not that special.
---
you would think that having an alt would be good for farming but i wouldn't be so sure about that...my main was a prot warrior and i wanted an alt so i could properly farm so i leveled a mage to 60. i told myself "this character will just be the farming bitch to improve my main character"...then i suddenly found myself crafting expensive high-end gear &amp; getting full enchants on my mage and now i had do maintenance on 2 characters instead of 1 and was even more broke than i was before :D
---
Makes sense, you're already playing classes that have a lot of possible roles. I think the altoholic syndrome begins faster if you play Warrior, Rogue or Priest first.
---
You can't see it because you're in the EU. It'll appear for you just before the next stress test. Americans already have it because the last stress test was US only.
---
&gt; Can Shamans actually reasonably tank max level dungeons though?  
---
I'm not sure.  There's always been some passionate people working to make it happen.  
---
&gt; Do they have a good aoe threat move  
---
The fact that they have single target threat moves is funny enough.    I think you just use your downranked aoes for pulling, and lightning shield for some extra threat.  
---
&gt; any form of mitigation at all, besides "mail armor?"   
---
They also have a shield, of course.  
---
Obviously tanking dungeons on a paladin will require less effort than on a shaman.  But there will be, for whatever reason, shaman dungeon tanks.

&lt;***Not Today***\&gt; - NA - Horde - PvP - PST - Casual
---
**Introduction**: Not Today is a *casual* PvP guild that plans to do a little end game raiding. The guild is comprised of members who played together from Vanilla through WotLK. Unfortunately, we are no longer in our 20's nor can we skip work like we did our college courses. Most of us are happily married and have families to provide for.
---
**Expectations**: Our typical atmosphere is light-hearted and laid back, all the while being competitive (as far as our time restraints permit). We expect everyone to be respectful, but if you suck at being teased every so often, then this probably isn't the guild for you. Raiding is not a requirement, though it is highly encouraged. We will be utilizing Loot Council. In addition to some end game raiding, we plan to spend a majority of our time engaging in PvP.
---
**Schedule**: Raid nights will likely be Tuesday and Thursday evenings, 7-10 PM PST. This is tentative and can change. The core of us have raided Vanilla through WotLK. Core members are predominately West Coast players.
---
We are looking for like-minded people. Causal, fun and laid back. Albeit short, if this sounds like a good fit, please apply below and we will get back with you shortly.

---
Lol. FIFA world cup 2018 would like a word.
---
Getting ready to never see it again bb
---
Let me ask you something. You say that first of all you bring a CLASS not a spec to the raid. Then you expect warriors to wear shields when it will make fights easier. Yet you think playing enh shaman is 100% fine and enh shamans are by no means obliged to make the fights easier by just going resto. Thats plain stupid, either you shout out loud „hell no I play what I want”, or you play your class to the fullest. Dont expect fury warriors to tank for you if you are lazy enough to not heal for them.
---
Both roommates have a 32" ultra wide. They usually just play windowed mode and have all that stuff on either side of the game in the center. Then for games they want to focus on (AoE2, Rocket League, etc.) they'll full screen it
---
&gt;So the solution is to watch someone else auto-attack mobs?
---
A lot of people actually prefer having something low key like this because it doesn't require any real attention to gain value from it.
---
In 1.12? No we couldnt, but on the beta client you can.
---
I went through this process when I was researching druids. I loved the *idea* of them, but when I saw that you often need to cycle through forms during combat I was put off quite a bit. In my mind if I am feral, i don't want to have to change forms to maximize survivability or just to use a different spell that is only in bear form.
---
I'd rather not rely too much on the checklists because they are more like the fad or flavour of the week. Not to say they have no value. I'm just sure they will change quite a bit by this time next year. Meta is always evolving like that because everyone going for the same gear will play a factor in supply. Perhaps I'm lucky because I find the group I play with are always breaking the meta or setting a new standard In each game we hit. Some people look at the same problem and come up with very different ways to solve it.
---
For a guide (well a demonstration really) there's [Perplexity 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM1bSJm6GTE). You'll need to watch a lot of it at half speed to see what's happening but he has added comments to some of it and you can always ask if something doesn't make sense.
---
Beta was the only real counterpart for what to expect, unless you have some inside information about the live version. Also if you are even aware, the usual aoe spots are not even quest hot spots. The layering can fix that easily.
---
Am I really the only person that thinks class leaders are a joke role?  Do modern guilds even use them?  The whole concept makes no sense and just seems to be an ego thing
---
You’re arm is gonna ache so bad from moving your mouse all the way across that monitor, lol
---
The cricket world cup ended like a week ago..
---
I think it will be until people actually get into raids. A commonly tossed around idea is that Vanilla was harder. People need to remember that Vanilla was "harder" because it was a new game and nobody had shit figured out yet. We've had ~14 years of hindsight and practice on a HARDER game.
---
You want to be unique and also useful? 
---
Good luck.
---
He won't be if you foresee heavy damage phases. Part of being a good healer is knowing when the tank will hurt at what boss.
---
Sure, but keybinds and macros take as long to setup as most UI addons and you can have those ready to go which is fun to do anyway.
---
One thing to consider is the word leader. Make sure you're able to answer questions, help build aspiring priests up, build morale, have patience, and address problems with respect and understanding.
---
SoR is better for procs, as the damage it deals counts as a weapon hit.
---
The SoCru 40% increased attack speed is compensated by a 40% attack speed debuff, the dps increase is supposed to come from the higher AP.
---
The advantages from using SoCru over SoR are that: 
---
1. Your faster hits will provide a more steady damage output (less chance of overkill)
---
2. Your entire damage output scales with +crit 
---
3. You can judge wisdom/light with no dps loss
---
4. You can use Retribution Aura instead of Sanctity
---
5. If you build around SoCru you have more talents left for +healing.
---
SoR will however generally do more dps by itself (thanks in part to judgement), and provide you with more procs.
---
Compared to SoC, it also scales with crit, but is PPM based, so requires a very slow 2-hander to work. It is also very bursty, and prone to overkill as a result, but will do more overall damage with an appropriate weapon.
---
Overall SoCru is a viable levelling alternative to SoC and SoR for those who prefer a bit more healing/sustain power and consistent damage output over higher dps/burst ability.
---

&gt;figure out what you want to do and what class fits your playstyle.  
---
&gt;This is why I enjoy Cat, Rogue, bear, or warrior. I need to mash buttons. Even if my rotation is simple, every mob is like a coin slot machine where I win by playing so long as I don't die in the process. I can never go back to spellcaster.
---
cool
---
Most of the T2 and T3 sets are still the best looking sets ingame in my opinion.
---
For those of us know what exactly it is we want to do, and how to do it, it does matter quite a bit -- but is also irrelevant because we've already made that choice  or experimented around during vanilla to know.
---
For those diving right in to play for just the fun of it and nothing more then its true. It is basically irrelevant. Until players have that moment when they experience something or see another player do something amazing. Then they will know what profession, class, race, spec, goal to fulfill and pick within Classic.
---
That's when the altaholic breakd the cycle, but the only way is to try over and over until they find that *thing* they are looking for.
---
Hell, on onenprivqte server that thing was making shirts for people (shout out to shirts by shirt). Other people its having a 39 twink with 300 fishing for hours on end in azshera or booty bay. Or even still maybe you just enjoy being the pirate you always wanted to be plundering red ridge lowbies' pancreas. 
---
These self made goals and quirky things people enjoy will all eventually build up server communities.  
---
Have fun random Classic Player who rerolled troll female for the third time.
---
I was going to be orc rogue until I played my mage on a unofficial server. I'm going to run Mage and speed run to 60 as fast as possible, then using the gold I've earned level up my Rogue before the BG's release. I'll hopefully have enough gold to buy my mounts/skills and some good weapons to power through.
---
For sure ! I am still on the rock myself
---
Your response makes me sad but it's probably true. Can you just lie to me for a few minutes?
---
From what I remember from vanilla, having class leaders was a simpler way of having healing/tanking/dps officers.  Guilds were big and having 100 people rely on 4 or 5 leaders was a lot.  There was also a lot of specific knowledge around gearing/talents that was easier when your officer was actually playing the same class as you.  It also made it so everyone had some form of representation in the guild, no matter what role you were filling.
---
How many Hertz?😃
---
So then do you have to run in windowed mode?
---
Again, no, your numbers are wrong.
---
Cannibalize is also awesome levelling up, basically a faster regen than food on a CD. 
---
But Stun Resist wins every time for me
---
Why? It has a cooldown. It does not at all matter if it is on autocast.
---
But then it would look like its photoshopped in
---
Lol sure man. Stop acting like when someone says the World Cup, you stop them and ask “the basketball World Cup?”
---
But shit what am I kidding? You having a conversation with someone else? 😂😂😂 based on your reply you probably are that guy that thinks “chess World Cup” when people talk about soccer World Cup lol.
---
I'm not saying there shouldn't be delegation it just shouldn't be grouped by class.  There's more classes than you need leaders, the distribution between classes can vary significantly not only from guild to guild but even raid to raid, and classes can fill different roles.  So you've got 3 class leaders micromanaging healers? Yikes.  Healer leader, melee dps leader, ranged dps leader, raid/tank/specialty leader.  
---
4 leaders is more than enough and it covers all roles in a way that makes sense.
---
You might get some hate for the self promotion here. 
---
Some advice I can offer if you are trying to grow your stream, or wanting to plug yourself - create content or discussion first. 
---
Make a real obvious reason or Avenue for people to be interested in you specifically. Instead of just hey I’m here, which is a start, just not the one people typically want. 
---
Anyway cheers and good luck friend.
---
Plebs not knowing that Esfand invented green screens LULW
---
The only time Orc stun resist is not the answer is if you will literally never PvP... And even then sometimes Orc is *still* the best option.
---
I don’t think people understand how leveling in classic works.
---
Would be cheaper to buy gold than to pay 4 extra monthly subscriptions.
---
You can easily Paladin tank in 5-10 mans, just not raids.
---
This was my authentic classic experience 2004-2006
---
This subs plans for [time off](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=time+off&amp;restrict_sr=on)

If you never played it, its worth going through at least once, just to see the sights and appreciate the artwork and story.
---
But Blizz really fucked up on that sequel. It went from dark, horror, hack n slash action to rainbows and lazers. They actually implemented a Real Money Auction House at release which was the dumbest shit ever. It blew up in their faces and eventually led to an even dumber decision: Dont let players trade with each other at all.
---
Right. I'm definitely not arguing how it used to be on actual vanilla servers. Just voicing that I know rogue feels good on private servers to me, but there's no REAL way to tell besides leveling one to like 40 which is a huge investment.
---
These combat mechanics like the higher parry chance however impact all melee classes, therefore fury warriors reaching threat cap will all have to hold their DPS.
---
Therefore it does not matter, if you top the charts with 2x1hander or 1x2hander. Both will wreck face, however less than on pservers.
---
All fem-orc rogue guild needs to happen
---
The early raids are pretty easy, but naxx has a few bosses that require a lot of coordination and execution for priests specifically. If you don't spend time training and practicing these skills in the early easy raids, then you'll hit a wall in naxx. I'm referring to things like mind control rotations for fraelina and razuvious and also all of loatheb. On these fights, the only really hard element is what the priests do, and if they fail the whole raid will be let down. Don't get complacent in the easy content.
---
Fantastic detailed survey. One of the few I’ve definitely felt valuable to answer.
---
Need all boe purples. It’s the only way to be sure. 
---
Even in a group of friends. That lil dps boost for 6 levels doesn’t mean shit when everyone in the group can get their mount at 40.
---
Druid does make an excellent tank for dungeons, they just don't hold up to raid damage like Warriors do. Druids have a way easier time with AoE threat, and so are quite strong for dungeons. If you're hoping to raid as a tank though, then yeah, Warrior is definitely the best option. A casual guild may accept a bear tank though?
---
Yep, one is all you really need. I'm not going to touch mine until I've gathered some pre-raid gear on my main though
---
As a Priest, my plan is to go dual gathering, both of which will supplement my gold/hr gain by 15gish per hour, then dropping both when I get my epic mount, picking up Tailoring/Engineer.
---
Don't place too much importance on hps/healing done - the healers are a team. If the boss dies the healers (all of them) got the job done (obvs within reason - if someone is doing 1% of the healing they need help). Overemphasis on healing charts leads to your healers making bad decisions to compete on charts.
---
Consider: a priest you've assigned to tank heal is bored bc he's stop-casted his last 3 greater heals - he hasn't done ANY healing in like 10 secs - wtf! That priest is doing his job and doing it well. Unless raid heals are insufficient/falling apart you don't want that priest to start targeting dps and spamming flash heals to compete on the charts. Eventually your tank will take those back to back crits and he'll die or your tank healer will overdo it on raid healing with inefficient flash heal and wind up going OOM towards the end and your MT goes down.
---
You do not want to encourage any trade downs in efficiency or job-assignments by making your healers feel like they need to compete for top heals.
---

"The lack of movement caused blood to begin to clot in the gamer's legs. When he found that his box of poptarts was empty and got up to retrieve another box a short distance away, this released the clot where it then traveled into his lungs causing a pulmonary embolism."
---
No it is not. Most decent tank weapons in vanilla are 1.9 or 2.0 speed. Quel'serrar, Bloodlords defender, Thunderfury, etc.
---
Why are you still responding, this entire thing is bait ya mook
---
That would fit the criteria but God they would be near worthless lol.
---
NO I DONT WANT LINEN CLOTH
---
No talking either, lo-fo hip hop or something. Maybe some nekkid nelves dancing around.
---
What were they doing? Advertising?
---
Thing is though that the bonus dmg from SoR is minimal at low levels. Also the judgement SotC adds little. Plus it means pressing more buttons and I am playing paladin not to press too many buttons...
---
I'm not sure it applies in Classic since I was more heavily into hunter theorycraft from TBC onward (and this might be much more recent, like Legion even), but I seem to remember there being discussion about lag between the pet's GCD and when the pet AI would use a spammable auto-cast ability. The theory was that macroing your pet ability to all of your abilities could increase overall dps not insignificantly. Based on hunter APM and mana management economy in Classic, we won't have a good candidate for such a macro, but if the lag still exists, it would probably be worth it to bind your primary pet ability to something you can easily spam, like mouse wheel.
---
Just fyi BRE armor pen is way less effective on classic than PS because PS messed up the armor values and made them way higher. On classic BRE's armor penetration is almost completely canceled out because boss armor is set to 3700 not 4600 so they already start at 0 armor fully debuffed.
---
That hasn't been my experience.  Class leaders role was mostly to be a point of contact for anybody playing that class for any reason. They would be knowledgeable enough to help directly, or be close enough to "upper management" to properly pass the person on to whoever they needed to talk to. We still had progression/core raid leaders, secondary raid leaders, pvp officers, etc.  
---
I guess the main difference is that class leaders were there to make sure you had everything you needed to step into the raid, and the raid leaders were there to make sure you were doing the right thing *in* the raid.
---
Sure, at work for now so I'll check in about that later on
---
Thank you appreciate the tips. Anytime you self promote you gotta be prepared to take hate! In this case specifically it’s difficult since classic isn’t even out yet so I don’t have any classic streaming content to share but I understand what your saying. Appreciate the rational tip!
---
That's what they do yeah.
---
I did other places but I'll do it again
---
SOR acts as 2 hits. The white melee swing and the yellow spell hit.  It has a chance to proc most chance on hit effects. SOTC is best to be judged or If you can seal twist. Even then wisdom is better
---
I like your build. I think it will do well for PvP. I played a UD priest back in vanilla. I am sure my build back then was different than this but I would have played with your talent set it looks fine.
---
That's just pure projecting. You practically expect there won't be virtually any layering and everyone starts at the same time and on highly populated servers.
---
There is just something about the way Taliesin tries to sugarcoat every mistake made by Blizzard that makes him very hard to watch, I understand why he doesn't want to get blacklisted by Blizzard but it just makes him seem so disingenuous.
---
Ive leveled queite a few paladins, and my conclution to using judgement of crusader is: its higher dps to use your judgement cooldowns
---
 on a SoR, - only use JoC when fighting an elite (longer fight).
---
Its pritty simple math, hope there will be no more confusion. (this was vanila and several private servers) 
---
Also: SoR can proc "chance on hit/attack".
---
With means 50% more effecientsy, compared to 40% from SoC.
---
And to answer your question about JoC+seal of light/wisdom = it improves dmg, not healing/mana gain. Likewice Judgement of light + seal of light, will always be better than judgement of light + SoC. 
---
Hope you had some questions anwered ;)
---
[Exorcism](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10314/exorcism) and [Holy Wrath](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10318/holy-wrath). They're good, but on long cooldowns.

From the Horde on the west coast, this guy gets it. Beating Naxx is the destination, but the goal is making fun and lasting memories along the way.

US, PST, Horde, PVP - Semi-Hardcore
---
Hello!
---
Been playing on and off since release.  Was a healer / raid / guild leader from vanilla to MoP.  Plan is to roll an UD Warlock with a Priest as my first alt.  Looking forward to 20 &amp; 40 man raiding, World / BG PvP, gearing up, and leveling together.
---
Don't plan on speedleveling to 60, but I do plan on doing it as quickly as I can.  Would love to find a guild that has members who plan on grouping for the zerg at the start and maybe later for instances.  Can't really dedicate 10 hours a day to a speedleveling group, but would love to be able to run instances with the same bunch of people.
---
Imp sprint, prep is good, pure combat is subpar
---
31/13/7 holy Paladin heals well in raids and can solo ok.  You kill stuff kinda slow, but it works, especially if you farm demons or undead so you can use exorcism.
---
And the viewport *still* looks constrained, because they changed the way FOV works... I guess a lot of people don't mind, but that's the one change that I just can't learn to live with. The X axis isn't terrible, especially if you have a setup like this. But they neutered the Y axis, which means you can't get true FOV adjustments anymore.
---
Maybe farming SM and alike for BoE? Plus BoP to vendor.
---
This took some serious effort.  They're the 2 classes I am most torn between, but I'm leaning lock since I "already did" mage back in vanilla, raiding into Naxx as a wee lad, and warlock would be new and fresh to me having never had one maxed.
---
That said, there's no expansion of WoW where I like the Mage's kit more than vanilla, while I really like TBC/Wotlk warlock....
---
My first character I made on release night in 2004 was an Orc Warlock.  Got to about 30 and stopped.  My biggest regret when I played WoW was not sticking with that character and playing it as my main all through expansions.
---
It's common practice to skip loot distribution in speed runs, though with loot trading now this will no longer apply.
---
Come join us on discord ! The admin team

Has a bit to talk about yet but your more than welcome

Don't fall for these people telling you that you can tank 5 mans. You can but it's not good. At all. You have very little threat, and mana issues.

Even though I was invited to a stress test I couldn't even download the client. Nothing appeared either on the app or the website, and still to this day. I did got in touch with customer support but nothing came out of it.
---
Could maybe somebody upload the client so I could paste it and check it with battle.net app ?
---
And if for the night, you have to lay down in a bed
---
I play the game because it’s a relaxing alternative universe. Not because I want to win or because I need a hard challenge.

---
That's why whenever accepting or challenging someone to a duel, you keep moving as the countdown timer is going, and stay out of range of frost nova, while staying in range of charge. And you spam charge to get it off immediately. Once in a blue moon they'll get the CS off if you weren't spamming hard enough, but this usually works.
---
We would love to have you !! :)
---
Since we're on this topic, how well does a holy paladin / ret (31/0/20) does while farming high level mobs for whatever reasons?
---
I know it will be slow but is it pull your hair kinda slow? Or is it a comfortable slow? 
---
Thanks for the input.

there are many bis list arround there and most of them are shit.

---
this one is good though, its vanilla patching so some items are probably better in early phases, but its still the best out there.
---
Don't get used to private server values. Blizz has internal earlier versions they are working through to make sure everything is correct, yet many private servers are essentially using guesstimates to approximate what things were like during vanilla. Or recreating it from their memory the best. They've never been 100% perfect and we shouldn't rely on them as an example of what classic was. Just something to look at if Blizzard is missing something on their end and we need whatever the next best source of info for it.
---
Mage will be and is the best class in vanilla not only for pvp/pve but also for aoe farming brd and black lotus farming in AV with mithril spurs and carrot on a stick. Plus the blink when the AV start so no other class can beat u in that matter.
---
That's the most disgustingly beautiful thing I've ever seen
---
Same. Played the same class (and for the most part spec) since I started this game.
---
my uni classes start up the day before launch, so im skipping the first few days of class to grind as much as possible lmao
---
It was my favorite too but honestly that is a slippery slope to classic wrath classic cata i just think they could do something else we don't need to go through the dark portal again
---
Check out my response below about HPS/healing done charts. Definitely NOT the way to judge healers (within reason). If the boss dies your healing plan was good and the healers did their jobs - if we wipe either the plan needs to be adjusted or someone screwed up their job. DPS is just different. Most guilds will have no problem pushing out the HPS needed to survive the encounter - it's about having your 10-15 healers applying the healing when and where it's needed.
---
Most rewarding when finished tho.
---
Yes, exactly. Arms / Fury or Fury / Arms with tanking gear is great unless you're main tanking for progression, in which case you tend to go Prot / Arms.
---
That’s evil 😂 +1 for the salt factor.
---
Found the guy who didn't play during Vanilla, your entire mindset is toxic and I can guarantee you are not a good player no matter the spec or class.
---
yes you will. a full combat daggers rotation takes 30s, 3/3 imp SND lasts 30.45s
---
You can do [what my boy Xzin](https://www.engadget.com/2006/12/15/interview-with-xzin-the-man-with-ten-arms/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEBsqiTPAFkByy1VO1tWM0F3OUPg7kYtyWxawZ9ZEi8ZbLjq61D1kR5cCDH0EuqeEg-OhcNZtVQUugQ35eEFM_Tp0jcYVC3Vk1BbQezGKwvqtyrRQ_0xic5xlM7N2OybImQQhIMH9QNN72YhwqbYJQClGN3sUC98pIFw7lfzt7e2), US Magtheridon PvP did back in Vanilla with his Priest/mage setup.
---
He would run SM Cath in about 5 minutes, pull the boss, aoe them all down and spend the next 10 minutes looting.  He was able to make enough gold to eventually buy an epic mount for all 5 characters.
---
Was a blast playing with him in AB back in the day.  4 PoM mages to insta-kill players was hilarious.  Kinda hurt in WSG b/c we only had 6 players, but we could nuke down flag carriers with ease.
---
Either way, it's gonna be pretty awesome, so...
---
lmfao
---
Should include things like the Bindings and the Eye of Sulfuras.
---
Or else we might see an Arms warrior using Sulfuras lol
---
Sideways or panoramic
---
When you are a druid you are the pet.
---
Nelf make drood reporting! Carrying yo flags and tossing rejuvs like candy.
---
Also esfand looks like a pedophile and at least this guy doesn't
---
You're really good at this game and not a disappointment to your parents at all.
---
 If a warrior is considered the best tank out of the 9 classes and paladins are the 3rd best and you give thunderfury to a paladin it still won't make a paladin better than a warrior.  It'll just be a slap to the face of the guild that farmed all the mats for it.
---
Paladins can have hand of rag but TF should always be a warrior tank weapon as it actually benefits the raid, not just one person.
---
The whole point of druids is shape-shifting lol. Otherwise you're just playing a knock off warrior, rogue, or caster.
---
Why would you only gear yourself for resto, especially for pvp? During leveling druids shine as the tank in 5 mans, and are arguably the worst healer you can have in a dungeon.
---
In pvp they are good flag carriers- not in resto gear
---
That wouldn't fix anything, only reinforce the negative side effects of being slowed. Just because something has a slowed down movement speed should not mean they should have a reduced range of attack, that would be absolutely stupid.
---
I have yet to see evidence of the code supporting temporary slowing effects affecting the leeway activation. I know it has a minimum movement speed to activate, but does that imply base movement speed or base + slowing effects?
---
This is me. I had a 60 hunter with well over 100 days played in vanilla and a 60 warrior with less than 20. I didn't get 60 with any other characters until private server.
---
Yes really.
---
The enchant was tested on the Beta. We know exactly how it works. You are just another idiot spreading his uninformed opinion because you are too lazy to look up how it works.
---
Here's from Esfand's stream. The combat log clearly show there's no internal cooldown on the trinket.
---

---
I switched jobs so I’d have time to enjoy classic. Only have a week and a day of PTO, gunna burn it all on two weeks after release to hopefully miss out on the initial Zerg and get my warrior/rogue to upper 40s.
---
It would be ok, similar to the spec I posted below but you would probably use command and a two handed.
---
&gt; Usually I just buy rank1 and use it for skilling up weapon skill faster when I get a new weapon.
---
insert rick and morty 'you help level weapon skills' meme here
---
Well, you will not want to be deep prot until lvl 53. Up to lvl 53, go Fury. You will tank everything just fine. At lvl 53, you can go Shield Slam spec, have 5/5 cruelty, 5/5 Deflection and 3/5 Tactical Mastery.
---
You don't have to do it, you can do fine with 16 in prot (for Defiance) and rest in Fury. But you should, so you can actually see the difference between a Prot Shield Slam spec and Fury spec tanking styles, so you can be better prepared for when you hit 60, as a Shield Slam spec tank.
---
There will ALWAYS be a spot for you in all 5 men dungeons, UBRS and 20 men raids. There are never enough tanks for everything under 40 men raids.
---
40 men raids, that is another story. Guilds will run 40 men raids with maximum 3 Prot Warriors, usually 2 Prot Warriors only. So, not make spots in a raiding guild for a prot Warriors.
---
But everything under, which is pretty much 90% of the game, a prot Warrior will always have a spot.
---
&gt; pretty easily
---
I'm going to go with no on this one.
---
only if you have a guild full of bad faith actors.
---
I healed my first MC as enhancement wielding an ice blade hacker and draconian deflector whilst specced in to armour and Defensive talents in the tree. This would be very early 2005.
---
Your comment was extremely vague "thats basic paladin gamrplay" i wouldnt call using SOTC for the speed buff basic gameplay. Its not strong or common
---
Y2K
---
Around level 10 you're going to meet up in barrens/silverpine anyway, so not that much, especially as horde since you get zeppelins to quickly travel between continent capitals.
---
Do you know, is classic going to support resolutions this wide?
---
It's possible to do both :)
---
What gear in that list do you think should prio to a hunter?
---
a good question to ask: will the average player/raid/guild know what their pre-bis gear or raid spec is? i feel like the min/max crowd is so vocal on this sub, it makes me wonder who the actual average player will be (vs the average of people who min/max).

**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore  Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild named &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community. Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.    
---
**Who are we?**   
---
Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2004-2006. Our raid leaders have raided in vanilla through Naxx, and have raided through Naxx on private servers. Others have achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. In short, we raid to gear for PvP. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.    
---
**Who are we looking for?**  
---
We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40+ man roster. Our current raid roster is "full", but please still apply as there is inevitable turnover that will occur. Everyone that joins will have every opportunity to earn a raid spot. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community.    
---
**What will we be doing?**  
---
We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use a 25% weekly decay DKP system for loot. There will likely be a 3rd optional day added in the future during BWL progression and onwards. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process. Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.

 np, my son deletred a lower level alt back in BC and I never forgot that lesson, lol
---
You can't reach level 60 two times in 2 weeks...
---
Ain't gonna happen.
---
For horde it's very unimpactful since you cannaturally just go to barrens after starting zone so at level 11-12ish. There's a zeppelin just outside undercity that takes you to outside of orgimmar so it's very easy to go there.
---
For alliance it is a little bit harder since NE are seperated by entire wetlands which is a lvl 20-30 zone. It can be crossed fairly quickly by dying in clever positions but it's a lot harder than just going to barrens. 
---
The story and progression is not really impacted at all. The game's roleplaying/quest system is very primitive so your early decisions in that department isn't going to haunt you for the rest of the game or something like that.
---
This is getting out of Hand of Gul'dan.
---
I'm not sure if I'm impressed or appalled!
---
You don't stay 2/5 corruption, you just do that first, get improved imp, and then finish up imp corruption.
---
You just start out in different areas, really. One of you could go meet the other right away and you can quest together without issue.
---
The only problem that might come up is if one of you is playing a class that doesn't have a trainer in the other's leveling zone. 
---
For instance, if you had an Orc Shaman go over to Tirisfal Glades, they only have trainers in Brill/Undercity for the classes that Forsaken can play as, so you'd have to take the zeppelin back over to Orgrimmar any time you wanted to train new abilities.
---
Not quite. There's just a cap at +4 levels (20% more xp than same level mob)
---
So a level 1 won't get any more xp from a level 59 than he would from a level 5 kill.
---
But the level 60 helping will absolutely murder those level 5s that the level 1 is tagging.
---
Ya, I've been reading his posts and if you didn't know any better you'd think it was 2004 again. He's living in the past.
---
Class leaders don't make sense these days because why should a Prot Warrior be in charge of a DPS warrior? Or, like you said, if you only have 2-3 of a class what's even the point?
---
A GM, Raid Leader, and 2-3 other officers is all you need. If your guild needs 10+ officers to keep people in line, holy shit, find a new guild. I also can't even begin to imagine the clash of egos when 1/4 of your raid is a Leader/Officer. Yikes.
---
Its not hard, it just takes time. If you do nothing but play vanilla 16 hours a day you'll hit 60 in like a week
---
Same applies for dkp, worked fine in my guild in vanilla and we cleared naxx.
---
I saw a lot of casual guilds implode from LC drama, I’m sure in an elite guild it’s fine.
---
First Level 60 - 48hours 6,3% - oh boy. Some of you will encounter a nice surprise.
---
I laughed at your comment, but then I thought about the plank just falling through the void and on the ground mid combat. Made me laugh even harder.
---
/thread
---
Yeah I just use a 49'' TV and have it at just the right distance so it kinda covers my field of view. Its super immersive, wasn't expensive, and isn't a weird aspect ratio.
---
isn't that dizzy feeling actually ***immersion ?***
---
If there are warriors/rogues in the group who were clearly there for HoJ, then I'd say it's ninjaing. Hunters don't need anything that says "chance on melee hit".
---
If there was an in progress lvl 19 rogue twink in the WC group who specifically needed the Leggings and stated that they needed it, but some warrior took them, then it would be ninjaing.
---
I really love to see people think they are going to get to 60 so quick. Even two characters! Best of luck to you!
---
dont use curse of agony because life tapping and leveling faster is bad! I don't know the real answer but seems like an old guide, better than going in blind though.
---
No one has said the monitor name, so ***NO*** I actually cannot. Thanks for trying tho.
---
I’m also like this. Started in BC as Paladin Tank. Didn’t have my first alt until end of Cataclysm, and that was a DK. Even then, I was so attached to my paladin. When my guild at the time asked me to main my DK for MoP, I had serious internal battles about it.
---
Tis a wound from which he might never recover.
---
Isn't stamina the best pvp stat? also resilience in TBC? That kind of goes against your premise that PVP isn't to outlast the enemy.
---
So you're saying DKP *isn't* "the only way"?
---
I'm not disputing that people can/will use DKP, but the notion that it's "the only way" to go is blatantly incorrect.
---
Judge it onto target and switch for command or righteousness for bit of extra holy dmg. Other than that, a weapon skill farming seal.
---
Well you are getting it!
---
Streamers promote the groupthink mentality that, in my opinion, has led the gaming industry down the regrettable path it is currently on. That, and it's so cringey.
---
But maybe im just being nostalgic. Maybe I just yearn for 2004...when youtube/twitch didnt exist. Maybe that's why I don't want them around me in classic?
---
Ew first person view
---
I took off 2 days and have no plans except to just play and then go back to work lol
---
The biggest advantages/disadvantages the different races offer in regards to leveling is their starting zones.  Do you prefer questing in the Barrens, or Silverpine Forest?  That's about it.
---
Your brain, in an attempt to avoid buyers remorse, justifies the purchase by “adjusting.”
---
&gt;The World Cup sees 10x as many fans traveling to the host country than the Olympics.
---
The numbers you present make up the total, not the tourists, which is not the subject.  
---
As for attendance vs. attendance, 3.5 million people attended the World Cup matches. 1 million of 7.5 million tickets remained unsold for the Olympics, meaning 6.5 million attendants.  
---
 [https://www.travelwires.com/fifa-world-cup-boosts-brazils-tourism-numbers-33824](https://www.travelwires.com/fifa-world-cup-boosts-brazils-tourism-numbers-33824)   
---
" In June, when the competition was held, the number of international tourists tripled, climbing from 350,025 in 2013 to 1,018,876 in 2014."  
---
The numbers I presented make up the tourists, as was the subject.  
---
So yes, we're a farcry from the "10x as many".
---
With 20k, if we assume an even split between EU and US, and assuming only RP server players responded (ie. assuming all sorts of other players did not vote to show support,) that would be 10k players on an RPPvP server in each of those regions. I think that would provide enough for a server in each region even if only the respondents are interested. And they would likely make up only a small portion of the actual RPPvP base.
---
It's different with 40 people. Class leaders are responsible for organizing amongst class groups. An example is the paladin class leader would make sure the appropriate paladins are giving out the right buffs to the right people.
---
Amen OP. I hope people just have fun with classic, you don't need to be like the big streamers, they are playing this game a lot differently than everyone else and with different intentions. Level those alts, have multiple level 30s and 40s because that was what vanilla was all about, just having fun.
---
What do you mean looks like? Esfand is a known Michael Jackson fan. *Kappa*
---
I won’t take my chances is all I’m saying.
---
People can turn into weirdos when a rare purple drops and can cause drama.
---
I can already see youtube videos with people doing bgs with random talents as challange
---
I wouldn't expect to show up to raid does to put up numbers better than pure specs - in most cases all the extra effort you go to on offnights is so that you can show up to raid days and only be slightly behind pure specs instead of massively behind.
---
Troll Warrior Tank, Blacksmithing-Mining. I want to BiS Tank so bad, I love tanking so much, but when I started Classic I was a Tauren Hunter, I thought Warstomp would be great for disengaging my target.   
---
Since TBC I was tanking till BFA Pally-DK-Warrior-Druid-Demon Hunter. I can't wait to Tank in Classic. Every game I play is just a time waster till then.
---
I can ALT on retail got all classes to 120.
---
The icon is a gold piece even!
---
Yup I agree. And any competent "Priest/X Leader" can manage all of your healers as Healing Officer easily, even if they never touch an alt/different class. WITHOUT some "Druid Leader" getting in your way.
---
I started my wow career as a night elf rogue because I loved dual wielding and being able to sprint. I really liked the idea of death by a thousand cuts and cunning from the shadows etc. Then I saw a druid turn into a godamn bear and my mind was changed. 
---
Then I saw a guy had a pet fucking owl and I was like wtf you get a pet??!?!? This changes everything. 
---
Then i saw a fucking imp and was like wtf that dude has demonic pets??? 
---
At this point I thought I would experiment with horde and started with a warrior after the revelation that they didn't use mana. I thought that was OP. 
---
I got tired of warrior and went for a mage, fireballs were ridiculous 2 hitting stuff I thought it was crazy. I got the mage to about level 35 before my world fell apart and saw a shaman turn into a fucking GHOST WOLF. 
---
I settled on shaman until BC where I of course played a blood elf paladin.
---
Also Pally tank was not really a thing until TBC.... In Vanilla they pretty much did one thing well....  Heal...
---
Edit: i can't type...
---
what monitor is this?
---
It's different because the rogue/warrior weapons are highly sought after and usually super rare. Getting both Dal'Rend weapons would probably take a warrior like 20+ runs.
---
A ranged weapon is different. Nobody is really competing to get those. A hunter could just run a dungeon for a bow drop and get it in like 1-3 tries.
---
Oh my god. I totally forgot about swing timer. Dang it. Well I guess my group can help me when they're 20 and I'm done with all buttons.
---
Don't forget your Molten Core WeakAuras!
---
pretty ok guide
---
Me too pal.
---
LOL good one dude, you really hurt me there.  
---
Oh hey, nice necroposting btw.
---
Youtube is a plague.
---
I think that's the beauty of classic, each class has its own mechanics the makes you want to play it every other class makes you wonder if you should have rolled another class and people that look at you probably think the same thing, it really speaks a lot about the quality of the class designs
---
What are we even looking at?
---
snow is annoying sure, but that isn't petty to say, goes against the spirit of the game even if it is legal. I've run into multiboxers in pvp and it isn't fair when they hit you with 5 auto crit chain lightnings.
---
The problem is not the drop rates. The problem is the RNG algos. NOBODY knows how Blizzard RNG works. Absolutely nobody. An this RNG is applied to everything, from drop rates, to critical hits, glancing blows, parry, etc.etc.
---
Classic will be a shock for private server players than never played Vanilla back in the day.
---
And the drop rates will be the smallest shock.
---
The big one will be Fury and Druid tanks dropping like flies on raid bosses.
---
The RNG on Blizzard is HIGHLY different than pservers, and it works AGAINST the player, not FOR the players, as it does on private servers.
---
WoW ruining people's college careers, very authentic to the vanilla experience.
---
You just started a job and you're gonna take a week off? You'd be fired in my book
---
But Horde doesn't have paladins, so it's like why do they even exist?
---
The 1-10/11/12 experience is fairly set in stone for every race, you fumble around your starting zone, maybe do your lvl 10 class quest(most important for Hunters).
---
After the initial zone, it's pretty much free reign on where you want to go, though, don't expect a single zone to have enough quests to progress you to the next level range(apart from the initial 1-10 zone). So if you want to level fully from quests, you have to do travelling around the 2-3 zones that you have available at each given level range.
---
Especially Horde has it very easy with travelling since there is a zeppelin from Orgrimmar to Undercity which makes traveling between the 2 10-20 zones very easy for the Horde. 
---
Alliance has it a bit more difficult, you are going to have to do the Wetlands run as a Night Elf. Though I do not have 100% confirmation, I have heard that the death skips do work on both sides of Dun Morogh(climbing up the mountain towards Menethil and also swimming south of Menethil and dying in the water teleports you to Dun Morogh).
---
&gt; I took off 2 weeks and I want to have 2 60s by then
---
The average time to 60 is around 10 days, which means an average of 17 hours played per day for two weeks for only ONE character. I'm going to guess you won't get even one character to 60 in two weeks, hope you prove me wrong, good luck !  
---
RemindMe! September 10th, 2019 "See if I was wrong about /u/torbtorb1"
---
I took the whole week off and the better part of the next. 
---
Give it to me Blizzard! MY BODY IS READY!
---
I agree, twitch and youtube can potentially fuck classic up with more popular players crying that tbeir class isnt strong enough
---
Troll Warrior here ready to tank the shit out of some content.
---
You call it "micromanagement" but I'm really trying to describe to you a role that isn't for managing so much as being an established point of contact, resource, and advocate.  
---
There has almost always been a way to find BIS lists, specs, rotation guides, etc., but that isn't a substitution for somebody you can actually talk to.  It's also important to have somebody that represents you and your class, especially for minority classes/specs.  
---
If you were to break down the hierarchy I plan on using / adapting (minus all the low ranks) it would look like this:
---
GM &gt; core/progression raid leaders (MT/OT/main raid leader, ranged dps officer, melee dps officer, healing officer) &gt; secondary raid leaders (typically a mix of core leader alts and backups) &gt; class leaders  &gt; guild members. 
---
Class leaders are really there to bridge the gap between 20-30 people and a single raid leader.  They prep them for the raid, but the actual raid leader is responsible for the "management" part.  Raid leaders likely work with class leaders to see where people are in terms of skill/gear so they can build the raid, but aren't responsible for every single person who could potentially fill that role.
---
You end up with 8 class leads, 3-5 raid officers, 1-2 raid leaders, and 1-2 guild leaders for a PVE focused guild.  There's typically 2-3 PVP officers too to organize premades and keep track of PVP contribution to the guild.  That's only ~15-20 core "upper management" people for a guild that will be around 100ish unique players.
---
I think it's been a whole 13 hours since one was posted on here, and maybe another 5 hours before that another one was posted.
---
I've done so much raiding in fact, I know that if most people put in the necessary effort they should never surpass the tank on threat. On the Horde it might be harder but there is absolutely no excuse for the Alliance.
---
a nelf with a nose stud?
---
Blizzard is the one with historical numbers.  I'm sure they're not going to release a handful of servers.  It's going to be interesting how their estimates vs actuals come out to be once classic goes live.
---
Weird flexing right now but I just gave in my 1 month's notice at work. Going balls out all in. There simply ain't no other way.
---
I'm actually *slightly* afraid of suffering a heart attack or a random blood clot fucking my shit up during the initial weeks and month, but you only live once this life anyway...
---
Oh so it takes advantage of the damage delay! Wow, that's really interesting. Does it have anything to do with spell batching or is it just baseline?
---
Also if you're a druid you can go anywhere, since teleport: moonglade is a thing very early on
---
Take one final look at the past. aaaand we're out.
---
&gt; The dungoen Tank who always finds a group
---
Well I'm already planning that on being me.
---
Feral tank will most definitely be farming mcp
---
3 months of. Guild leader, main tank &amp; a lvl 60 alt are all boxes I aim at. 
---
Don't care if my sanity is lost in the process. Let it burn. Never did me any good anyways.
---
Yeah but a friend is going to teleport and leave his friend behind. This is more relevant for solo play.
---
What? You think Alliance doesnt have threat issues? Your guild had awful dps then.
---
The way this company works is they grant PTO all up front for the year, then employees lose all but 2 days at the end to carry forward to the next year. I’ll have been here 3 months by that point, and the boss already gave me the green light! 
---
- when I initially got hired, 2 weeks before my start date, I’d called my supervisor to ask if I could have 4 hours off for my wedding the 2nd week after starting (they were aware of that one at my interview, but I didn’t have a date set then) She laughed and said sure- fast forward to my start date my supervisor asks if my wedding is on a Saturday since I wanted that 4 hours Friday, nope told her it’s Friday. She said, well don’t you want more off then that? I can give you as much as you want. She joked she should call my fiancé to make sure I wasn’t low balling it and wanted to give me as much time as my now wife and I wanted. 
---
So I took Thursday/Friday/Monday for the wedding. In fact, I’m now known around the company as the guy who only wanted 4 hours the day of his wedding, even the CFO/controller thought that was hilarious. 
---
Definitely the MVP place to work in my book.
---
Crap, I thought I was quick enough on the draw for this. Pardon if I'm adding to a pile of similar posts.
---
It does matter.. a lot actually.
---
You are assuming a lot of us are slow levelers, alt aholics or alone...
---
I don't think they would either.  Layers are there to prevent people from seeing a queue.
---
The only way I would see them mix layer and queues is if it's WELL beyond the 2 week time frame they expected to eliminate layers.  They won't just flip off some server that has 10 layers running (although honestly I only see like 3 and maybe 4 max) where people all of a sudden are hit with a queue time of 30,000 on a single server.
---
sorry didnt notice your reply...
---
we had 3warriors 1shaman 1priest
---
we did have an damage meter but didnt save the values. but i can say our melee/support shaman did surprisingly good dps. he takes care of spell interupts at distance, some kiting and throws in heals if shit hits the fan.
---
and of course wf totem.... not much to say to that. amazing
---
i consider shamans as a vital part of the group the added support for warriors far outweight there weaker dps. which isnt even that bad.
---
kick your rogue and get a shaman, nobody needs rogues anyway
---
Theres no best perspective. A main tank raid lead will know what mechanic happens exactly when, so he can yell at people to remind them. He'll also know exactly when theres a healing problem, since hes on the receiving end. But his perspective is inverted, he doesn't really know where everyone is.
---
A healer raid lead will have perfect oversight and know when people aren't executing the mechanic correctly.
---
And i pretty much just repeated what you said. There just isnt an optimal raid lead by class. The optimal raid lead depends on the person.
---
Sure, if you're going at better-than-world-record pace.
---
I don't like sleeping and with mild insomnia it just works out that way which I love. Sleeping is the worst and most boring part of any day
---
I agree with the first sentence, but most are assuming that the old record will be beaten, not the other way around.
---
Nope, hunter straight through to 60 with a ret paladin alt for when I want a break from the hunter. The only question is races. If I were going Horde then it would be Orc but I have to go Alliance for a paladin, I prefer the aesthetics of Night Elves over Dwarves but the Dwarf racials are way better for hunter so I'll probably do that. Human for the ret paladin for sure though.
---
If you're in Tanaris leveling, you just set your hearth to the inn in Gadgetzan. TP to moonglade, train, hearth back to gadget, keep questing. Almost 0 downtime
---
Honestly, if you're asking on reddit tips to be a class lead... I don't think you should be a class lead.  You should already be confident in your ability to be a class leader.  Leadership tips are a whole other level though.
---
Quite literally any video out on youtube of a half-respectable guild and their dps/healers not reaching 0 mana is my proof.
---
Comparisons don’t work too well between then and now as the game has changed so much. 
---
The basics are the same and you can see the basics in something like a video from vurtne, for example. But even there to make a comparison you have to look at something like p.server mage pool, but then you have issues the coding, gearing, latency, etc. once you get through that the videos look and sound similar.
---
Pve is a different beast. You can compare world first race times but how do you compare them? Compare past times to modern raid times? Dynamics have changed, phasing is a thing, raids just work differently now. You don’t see 3-6 month clears anymore but attributing that to players skill is like playing pin the tail on the donkey.
---
So if you go p.server you run in to the same issues with pvp, and add to it 14-15 years of cleared history, guides, hands on time. 
---
So basically you can’t draw a direct comparison. This is why I asked for some specific things that make modern players better than the og’s at the time.
---
If you think those guys that spent months working out how to take a boss down, day after day for months don’t know how to play as well as modern people, I just can’t agree.
---
you sound like a noob.. see you at 60 in 4 days after launch
---
&gt;  the obnoxious shit they deal with
---
Hunters: Buying ammo
---
Mages: Being a vendingmachine/transportation
---
Priests: Being a healbitch
---
Druids: Being a jack of all trades, master of none
---
Paladin: Being a role capable of wearing plate and being forced to wear a dress
---
Rogue: Having to train up your poison and lockpicking
---
Warrior: Having no utility to ever get away from fights, and never getting to do damage in dungeons.
---
OMG guys, it says the word Alliance.  Obviously they're not talking about Marvel Ultimate Alliance and obvious World of Warcraft Alliance!
---
I get 7 weeks PTO so no harm in taking a week
---
You are seeing patterns where the dont exist, OP. It's cuz you're really excited.
---
So half your raid is in "management"? Who cares if there's 100 guildies. There's half that in a raid at any given time. As Healing Officer, literally any resto druid/shaman can ask me how they can improve, or what they're doing wrong, or anything else. I'd make it my responsibility to know the answers, nevermind the fact I'm a Priest. 
---
Why does every every warlock need somebody other than an Officer to "represent their class"? THEY, the warlocks themselves are representing their class. If they have a question ask an officer. 
---
&gt;Class leaders are really there to bridge the gap between 20-30 people and a single raid leader. 
---
This... is what Officers are for....
---
&gt;being an established point of contact, resource, and advocate. 
---
&gt; but that isn't a substitution for somebody you can actually talk to.
---
This... is what Officers are for...
---
&gt;It's also important to have somebody that represents you
---
&gt;and your class, especially for minority classes/specs.
---
Why?
---
&gt;GM &gt; core/progression raid leaders (MT/OT/main raid leader, ranged dps officer, melee dps officer, healing officer)
---
This is literally all you need.
---
&gt;Raid leaders likely work with class leaders to see where people are in terms of skill/gear so they can build the raid
---
Officers along with the RL can do this.
---
&gt;8 class leads, 3-5 raid officers, 1-2 raid leaders, and 1-2 guild leaders
---
&gt;That's only ~15-20 core "upper management"
---
This is so fucking OD that it's actually cringy. The fact you unironically did NOT put quotations around "only" is hilarious.
---
How the fuck can this be viewed as anything other than extreme micromanagement to the point where ACTUALLY managing the guild will be anything but a huge headache for everyone involved?
---
This guy classics.
---
This version works I think.
---
This was my original plan as well, but I know I want to tank and am going to be tanking. As such I really need enchanting for that sweet sweet BiS enchanting trinket. So I think I'm going to go enchanting/tailoring (for the bags and the disenchanting) and then dropping both once I have the trinket and going to herb/alch. I think this should be a good way to do it since I plan on doing a lot of dungeon running this time around, probably running the same dungeons multiple times.
---
Although, I might just go enchanting/herb from the start, but I don't know... I know bag space is going to be super limited, so being able to make my own bags at the start might be nice.
---
Also should be noted that I am not really interested in speed racing to 60. I am perfectly fine with taking my time.
---
Ok that is actually hilarious
---
Wow!!! That's awesome.
---
Warrior - all Specs - PvE and  PvP. Many skills, mostly fluid except Arms.
---
Stance dance will be great to master. Macros &amp; buttons for every situation. Tanking and DPS feel just great.
---
Yeah, there are more than just Patchwerk, that fight is just the most blatant example of it. It’s 95% gear check and 5% mechanics.
---
I think most pure DPS check fights in early raids will be easy in 1.12 classes/specs equipped with gear with 1.12 itemization.
---
I mention this in another reply but raid wide DPS for Magmadar is ~6900 to kill it in 2 minutes, or about 230 per DPS. Even the shittiest meme spec destroys that all while (potentially) provides utility and flexibility to the raid.  DPS should never be the reason you lose that fight, it’ll be because people stand in the fire or the tank screws to their stance dance.
---
I know modern wow supports ultra wide screen, but will the classic client?
---
So what makes it miserable then?
---
I actually stuck with my Warrior through all of Classic. Never considered making alts until BC.
---
This is the best self promotion I’ve ever seen.
---
Probably just going to leave the layers longer on that particular server in that case as the only definite they have said (that im aware of) is a guarantee to get rid of layers before world bosses / at the end of phase 1. 
---
And if that time comes they will let the server crash and burn and offer free transfers to lower pop servers.
---
I have played my priest since launch and I plan to continue this tradition when Classic releases. ;)
---
You gotta be kidding
---
Excuse me but if you want the real classic experience you need to play at 1024 x 768.
---
There's a slight bit based on starting stats.  But you might only see that in 1-10 leveling as adding an extra DPS on top of 1 DPS is pretty significant early on.  As you upgrade gear/weapons, you'll notice that gap diminish and it won't really matter. 
---
Humans/Orcs get an advantage that you can attack higher level mobs and have less miss penalty, but it's still minor.  Reputation gains as a human are OK as well if you're trying to get exalted for another faction's mount rep.
---
But as far as playing two races, you'll start out in different areas, but you'll eventually merge into a central location in the barrens.  Another thing you could do, have one player take the run to the other starting area, as long as trainers are supported for that class.  i.e. don't have your shaman, druid or hunter friend go to the UD starting area, since there are no druid trainers there.
---
I really want to play a paladin, but I don't want to have to wear cloth until I get my tier sets. I didnt start playing a paladin until TBC so you may not have to wear as much cloth as I think.
---
This ain’t it. CRT or GTFO.
---
venruki, cdew, payo, joana, defcamp meld. It's good to have variety depending on your mood.
---
Yep, that's how I see it happening.  Hopefully I can get lucky and avoid the clulsterfuck servers at the start.  Probably a good idea to avoid any sort of server with a popular streamer as well.
---
What if it's all pictures of the same one from different accounts?
---
I can get the sword itself but not equip it or get the Feat of Strength? What’s the point in letting people do the quest - seeing the content? Sigh
---
This is a 32:9 right? I've loved my ultrawide 21:9 for WoW, SUW seems a tad extreme though haha
---
Classic and retail use different settings files, but you can set them up on retail and copy and paste them to the Classic folder.
---
As far as I know Ragnaros is available from Day 1 of Classic. How comes you guys think he will die in 3 days, when nobody will even be 60 in that time?
---
Some classes need more stam, some don't. 
---
Elemental shaman for example has a low need for stamina.  Wearing a shield + mail already, self heals, and a few kiting tools is a good way to reduce incoming damage on yourself rather than just having extra stam to eat the damage. 
---
Mage is another example, especially frost mages.  That class is built to control a fight and then use your offensive abilities to finish off the opponent.  A bunch of extra stam would mean you're lacking intellect or +spell power to actually kill someone, and extra stam would make no sense. 
---
Melee classes generally have higher need of stam because they're required to be jumping into fights head on.  Rogues might be an exception because of their many escapes, but Ret paladin, warriors, Enh shaman all need a good HP reservoir to survive the onslaught.
---
Man I hope every one the millions of people who played vanilla posts pics of their boxes and guides. I can’t get enough of this content
---
Sure? I'd say they are viable in a way, where people can't afford to make mistakes but all in all they can get the job done.
---
I bought a 21:9 3440x1440 when I had a GTX 760 mate. You'll have the monitor alot longer than you will GPUs. WoW is very easy to run as well btw
---
Was torn between one of these and 4k/144hz. Wound up going with the Predator X27 instead. Pretty cool monitor though, for sure. Enjoy it, man. I bet STV will look beautiful on it.
---
I will be off 11 of the first 14 days of classic. And I'll still be able to play in the evenings of the other 3 days.
---
First 2.5 days specifically my brother also has off and will be crashing at my place as we attempt to stay up for 30+ hours upon release.
---
This is why my friend and I took off that Wed-Fri since we figured the servers would be down the first day and a half. Hopefully it's a smooth launch.
---
There's a difference between *needing* advice and not knowing where to look vs. casting out a line because there's always a chance that somebody smarter than you is in the room.
---
You're talking like a huge chunk of sets in this game dont make no sense and have useless stats/bonuses.
---
Wut? That is not how fear ward works
---
Well if you are going to do something bad then atleast do it right
---
old WR is 4days 20 hours, with current beta testing its looking to be much faster than that, especially if you have help which Joana did not take years ago. 16 hours a day for 2 weeks is over 9 days played. If you are following a guide you'll hit 60 in like 6 days played even without experience
---
Well, here is my story. 
---
I dived in vanilla barely knowing what it is all about, which specs are meta and which ones are not and I wanted to play ret. So I rolled a pally and once I hit lvl60 the guild leader told me - if you want to raid with us, then you will be holy. However, if we're going to perform smoothly in a longer run, then you can go ret, but for now we need a healer and will try to give you some DPS pieces along the way.
---
A few months later we were doing pretty good and finally the GM told me that yes - you can reroll ret. 
---
I think it was ZG when I first tried it and... got severly disappointed. I have to say that i did not have r13 gear or flask, and it was a basic mix of caster and melee consumes. But doubt that it would have changed the situation much.
---
The melee damage by itself was far worse than I expected, since it glanced. And it glanced A LOT. I can absolutely guarantee that when you're dreaming about raiding as ret or enh you are not thinking that 40% of your attacks on boss would hit like a wet noodle. But they do. They fucking do.
---
You might think that the seal of command damage could have solved the issue? Not at all, it procced way less often than you would expect it, approximately every 3rd hit. And there was absolutely not guarantee that even if it did proc then it would land. You can cheapskate the manacost it with r1, but then judgement damage becomes a joke.
---
When you have ret gear - you feel that your judgements are expensive. I literally used it more often as holy throwing seal of light on almost every trash mob than ret. 
---
Consecration costs whopping 500 mana and damn, that's much. You can probably use it a few times on boss but that's it. 
---
"Why don't you just get more mana gear"? That's a correct question, but then your base melee damage drops down to the points when you do not even want to see it happening. There are very few gear pieces (T2.5 and r13 come to mind) which somewhat have both, but it's out of reach for most players anyways.
---
I tried it a few more times in MC and BWL and went back to holy. Not just the damage by itself is poor, but you are constantly handicapped by your mana pool and on longer fights boils down to autoattacking with low rank SoComm if you want to save at least some mana for the Hammer of Wrath phase. Even frostbolt spam on my mage alt was more entertaining.
---
I did not give up completely on attacking stuff in raids though. People were happy to see me slap on some hit gear and help with Nightfall uptime on trash and "target dummy" complexity-level bosses. But you do not need to be ret to do this job.
---
unless ur like, a battle mage with blacksmithing / fishing... then it matters
---
Me too.  I intend to farm demons in Felwood and WS with my holypally.  Should be able to do some AoE undead farming and possibly lashers in DM.
---
What I wanna know is: If I'm primarily a feral focused druid, but I am willing to, capable of, and geared for healing in a raid, is there any chance I'll get to roll for feral gear?
---
I'm less concerned about being able to play feral during a raid, more concerned about being able to gear up my feral.
---
To clarify what you just said, Dungeon Sets 1 (Tier 0) will be available at launch, but Dungeon Sets 2 (Tier 0.5) will come out with the AQ40 patch.
---
Inner focus is so great to have as an opener with your first mind blast.. Relatively short CD too.  Shadow priests are already strong vs casters, the -10% would help sure but having inner focus + 15% of mana regen will help you more IMO, as any caster that can heal (sham, paladin, priest) can potentially just outlast your damage and then finish you off when you're OOM.  The big crit and passive mana regen helps you stayout of that situation
---
Blizzard has to know that some classic returnees are gonna dislike it and give BFA a try instead. They really should do some kind of advertising
---
Probably outdated as it's from a 1.0 patch information.  Was like the Diablo 2 strategy guide I have which had all 1.0 spell values, that are not obsolete when they revamped them all and later added synergies.

Yeah, no fun to play a dead one either though, besides that it perhaps encourrages bonding. Which is the most important aspect of the game.
---
This is exactly what I was thinking.
---
It’s just vanilla itemization and Blizzard not having figured out how to properly min/max their own game quite yet.
---
This is honestly why Vanilla is so great though.  Min maxing and theory crafting is left to the community instead of Blizzard just doing it all for you and essentially holding your hand while you walk on the gear treadmill. Oh, tier 241 just released. Time to replace all my tier 240 gear!
---
While it’s a great feature of vanilla, I think it’s also one of its bigger flaws as it’s the same reason so few of the hybrid specs are viable.  TBC was the sweet spot in this regard IMO.  The further outside of TBC you get the more gear was homogenized until it eventually lost its soul completely in Cata.
---
'whoops I didn't mean to ninja loot but we took more than 2 hours'
---
I manually cast Growl since you really only need to use it once during an encounter unless you're blowing up a mob with crits. It's useful to have Dash/Dive on a hotkey as well for emergencies.
---
Any thoughts on what your friends are playing?
---
I'll start with what I don't like about the build... it lacks synergies between talents. I'm trying to think of where this build could shine and it looks like it has a world pvp focus? You mention you aren't looking to play frost but go very deep into the tree.
---
If you are looking to play a controller type mage with your friends, consider something more like:
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-05513231000001-023532301110513](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-05513231000001-023532301110513). I'll be honest, I'm not really a fan of this approach. There are enough mobs immune to slows/snares that I find this build putting a lot of eggs in one basket. I am assuming you deliberately did not do 5/5 improved Fire/Frost bolt. With this built you'd be Fire Blast on CD against ST fishing for stun procs while lining up Frost Nova + Cone of Cold for shatter burst. Blast Wave offers an ok, instant, AoE daze which lends to the build and Blizzard waves can proc Frostbite for additional roots. As a warning, Impact and Frostbite tend to make things harder, not easier in my experience. While mobs will be stunned/rooted an ok amount, it will have enemies spread apart unpredictably. Not sure if chaos = fun, but there you have it.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2-5052003003-20350033131001351](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2-5052003003-20350033131001351) is what I recommend, but this might be a little more traditional and not what you are looking for. ST will be Firebolt spam with or without 5x scorch start depending on how strong the mob is. AoE is Blizzard + Flamestrike, use Cone of Cold at max Winter's Chill. This should fill your Fire/Frost theme and likely lead to better over all damage/utility, but the battle field won't be littered with stunned burning enemies next to frostbitten enemies rooted in ice.
---
Best of luck. See you in Azeroth.
---
To the 30% of people who think the "average" DPS player will use flasks every week... You really need to learn what the word "average" means. The majority of raiders in Vanilla either never used a flask at all or only used them if they were a tank or healer, and even then only used them on tough progression fights. Certainly not "weekly". That's not going to change in Classic.
---
The coefficient makes the spell damage bonus even worse than you think haha. The set bonuses aren't bad, especially when coupled with some T3 pieces. Otherwise... Yeah T2 seems to be where it ends for hunter tier gear. I never had full T3, but it seems to be geared more towards high mana efficiency? T2.5 is just pretty bad overall.
---
Weird decisions from back in the day. It's not going to change though so be ready to reach peak at Tier 2 I guess :D
---
They will lose players like crazy if they have queues to play, since they have modern tech and servers.
---
wow so unique havent seen this post a thousand times

https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cg3fs7/petition_to_keep_cringey_posts_banned_so_we_dont/
---
They're actually quite good, but their aoe threat isn't good. Unless it's 3 or less targets.
---
Anyways, you'll be happy with Druid. :)
---
Nah that’s lame as hell
---
Back when the game was built for fun and not just balance.
---
I don't see why not. Unless there is a designated feral tank you will most definitely be able to roll for feral upgrades, assuming the rogues don't need it.
---
One underrated benefit is guaranteed 100% faerie fire uptime on bosses. It's surprisingly hard to find a resto druid who can do that for every boss.
---
They’re going to frantically make new servers and offer transfers like they did at bc release I imagine.
---
Blizzard servers will cost a sub and private servers presumably still won't, so not literally nothing. I'm sure some people will still be playing private servers.
---
I can’t imagine them having layering come phase 2. Either ridiculous queues or they deal with the shitstorm of “WTF kelthuzad classic server gets 3 world boss spawns and my smaller server only gets one!?!?”
---
Eye of Kilrogg waddup
---
I worked on getting T0 shadowcraft in Vanilla and it took me a very long time to just get like 6/8 pieces. Lots of work for not a lot of payoff. I did most of my grouping with pugs and not a guild, so that probably increased the time it took.
---
It's not worth losing improved mana burn, which is the most powerful PvP talent a priest can get in Vanilla.
---
You only need to growl as much as needed for the pet to keep aggro. If your pet growls more than that you're wasting focus and missing damage.
---
This subreddit spergs so hard over streamers. The construction thing is just a back fit justification to rationalize their hate

---
2H Fury is alot more viable then DW as horde when doing tier 1 content.
---
So you’re suggesting an orc rogue never lost to a non orc rogue? I mean that’s what you make it sound like.
---
100% once the prices are down, I'm in. I can buy a whole lot more gold with 1 hour of real work than i could ever manage to farm in an hour in the game.
---
The game is 15yrs old to further trivialise it seems silly. Technically, yes you could have the whole raid be warriors but how is that fun in any way? I could apply your notion to dps classes and tell everyone to go warrior. The game is so defined/resolved we've resorted to speed clearing raids as a form of way to challenge ourselves.
---
Test it out mate, numbers dont lie.
---
I was looking in comments for someone to mention ebbnflow haha he does really good Druid content. I have mained a Druid since LK and I know I wont be as good in classic but still looking forward to playing a Druid. He does solid content!
---
Why not just help this person out and say, “Hey, the word you wanted is immersion, not emersion.” ?
---
But is it viable? I mean a Warrior will always be a better tank right? Can you get anywhere close to a warrior? I read, that the Druid can't reach the def cap and can be one hitted by bosses...
---
Because the rotation is longer than 1 minute. You'll reach a point where you have 5 combo points and too much duration on SnD to make waiting an option right after the 1 minute mark. Use some common sense kid.
---
Oh, I have no problem with your post. I, too, like weird ass shit. I'm just making fun of the absurd "low quality meme" guidelines.

As a main tank I don't recommend it.  As an off tank that does feral dps or dispel spams when the tanking isn't needed it's good and brings a lot of value to the raid overall.
---
Such is life

Druids have some really nice pre-raid/t1 gear, you get overshadowed by t2 warrior, but you are still a decent tank. Your next big power spike is AQ. The high boss parry might suck for bears more than warriors though. 
---
All together you will do fine! Get some crowd pummlers and friends:)
---
That build is sick, been messing around with it on "ahem*, and loving the added utility.
---
Unfortunately there is no answer for your question.
---
I'm not taking time off for launch, only ever did that for one expac. Only because I went out of town to visit a buddy and we spent entire week playing WoD from launch. This was fun but I won't take off work for it again.   Day 1 I expect to be a pain In the arse anyway.
---
Viability can be balanced by how much content your friends can push you through
---
I already know I want to have an aoe grind mage as an alt. I'm just going to limit myself to 1 alt at a time.
---
Miss chance is 4%, of which 1% can't be negated with spell hit. Subtlety rogues get an extra +4% and priests &amp; paladins have +10-15% versus your fear and silence, so going 5/5 shadow focus is still useful
---
This is why you just roll a druid!
---
That depends if IWT is left in client, without it controlling melee is pain in the ass.
---
For raiding, you’d be hard pressed to be accepted as a tank, not because of any skill level, but due simply to game mechanics from the time. IIRC, Druid tanks don’t have any crushing blow mitigation, among some other things (it’s been a long time, my memory could be failing). In 5 mans, they’re fine. But I’m not so sure about endgame content.
---
Not sure why your calling me a butthurt retard, I only commented on your username as a joke since your coming off as agitated.
---
+Healing and +Spelldam does help your Mend Pet though, for max speed solo farming the lower-level dungeons. Nothing you'd want to roll need on for though.
---
the biggest problem a pala has in vanilla is the huge lack of a actual taunt. iirc palas were pretty okay as dungeon tanks in tbc but i could be wrong lol
---
so youre saying at some point youll have an excess of combo point that is worth spending on evis? can you timeline that out for me where you dont run up against an inefficient use of energy with non 5point SnDs
---
Nah, hemo is, imo, boring and no matter what build you play as a rogue, your MH is gonna make or break you, anyways, so I feel like you may as well play the build/style you want. And it sounds like he wants to play daggers, too.
---
NO CHANGES!
---
I agree!
---
Not really, kinda having the opposite problem. Bought a bunch of games on steam to fill the time, haha.
---
Curse of Elements should have included Nature damage :(
---
We don't even know that you'll have more than one single PVP server to choose from for your region/timezone/language.
---
Simply because a warrior can tank. I doubt anyone has a problem with a warrior dps if you have a tank already, but tanks being scarce means your average pug group probably doesn't have one when you join.
---
People get upset at the warrior dps for making them wait 30 minutes for a tank to show up when a dps could just slap on a shield and tank instead.

when i play hunter/warlock I keep pet on perma passive and bind attack to E and petfollow+petpassive to Q. In the open world i keep taunt on auto cast for the most part but I bind pet taunt to R so in  dungeons i can pull a mob off someone if needed. Voidwaller sac is bound to G.
---
I'm just leveling combat with a dagger OH all the way up, to minimize time training daggers at max, but trying to hold onto that combat build because it's just a way better time while you're leveling.
---
Please make at least one of these a day until launch.
---
How is this different to RDP session or something?
---
I actually like the debuff limit and the idea you have to pick and choose what you want applied to the boss for the circumstances. Like a boss that you particularly want bleeds applied to.
---
The issue is that it doesn't really work out that way in vanilla implementation, there tends to a set buff meta and it excludes abilities rather than promote decision making. In theory this could be worked around and have a better outcome I think though.
---

Give this thing a read: [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/) That article includes a link to a best-in-slot list for all kinds of druids.
---
Basically, druids can tank really well, you just have to get your gear outside of regular raid progression (mostly with a LOT of PvP for exalted rewards). They dip in power in BWL and catch up in AQ. For non-raiding, there's not even a question: get any leather gear with stamina and druids are great dungeon tanks.
---
Here's a video, posted a while ago, of a druid tanking Ragnaros in vanilla: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cd8ja2/would\_you\_adam\_and\_eve\_it\_nostalgic\_footage\_of\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cd8ja2/would_you_adam_and_eve_it_nostalgic_footage_of_my/)

*\*Mails a single linen cloth with COD\**
---
Even with full 18 slot bags a healing offset + a fire resistance set for tanking + a couple alternative gear pieces for particular fights + consumbles makes things very tight.
---
I get you are upset that you were downvoted and ganged up on but I had nothing to do with that so how about you act a little more mature
---
Link me anything of this guy that is even remotely similar and I will humor you
---
Any half decent Alliance guild should not have threat issues, unless there are major mistakes being done or you are progressing. This is not an opinion.

Thanks for the clarification.Sorry to interrupt your scrolling, I just kinda recalled that I had this tucked away, didn't realize how common  they were, especially given how long its been since the guide itself was relevant.
---
&gt;it is very unlikely that the will replace it. 
---
This isn't an absurd idea, and there's too much uncertainty to rule it out.
---
&gt;maybe they would make tbc servers but replacing the classic servers? nerver heard someone say that this will hapen
---
Blizzard hasn't confirmed that anything will happen after release of Naxx, so this is all just speculation anyway.
---
Just need a time machine.
---
LOL . I just started adding these into like my stream I have a few already but we are just getting started

This. I’m Rogue class lead in my guild and I’m consistently beat by one of my rogues in raids. My job is to teach them to be better. I’m their go to if something they don’t like is happening in guild. I tell them what is required of them as far as gear and consumables and show them how to get it if needed. You’re basically the person who every person in your class looks to to have their back. I try to be welcoming and message every new rogue as soon as i can to welcome them to the guild. I also use this time to find out their goals with the guild. I have a rogue channel in game they can join to ask any questions they they may have. That way if I’m not online the other rogues can help out. 
---
The most important part is being knowledgeable of your class. Nothing worse than your class lead doing nothing to help the other rogues because he’s only in that position because he’s the gm’s friend.
---
That was OP's words.
---
Without googling, i luterally couldnt tell you what sport that is.
---
I think I spent more time doing this than raiding. Reinforcements? Get them to chase you off and levitate. 
---
Possibly even more obnoxious is a shadowmelded priest on the zeppelin who mind controls you off in the ocean just before the load screen. Watch that fatigue timer.
---
I've got a Human Rogue that I played from '05 to '09. I came back to the game a couple months ago when I started learning more about Classic. I love that Rogue, the play-style, and the memories I had leveling, in Dungeons, and the couple of Raids my guild was able to try.
---
My friend that convinced me to really give Classic a go is on a Discord server full of folks I know through secondary connections. They want to play Horde.
---
Undead Priest it is!
---
I don't have any friends that will be playing Classic.
---
Why 1440 on a 24'' and not a 27''?
---
It’s pretty common for paladins to lvl ret and then switch to holy once they are at end game. I never had issue getting in as dps for the 5 man dungeons until 60. They are definitely not as good as other dps but have other benefits and most 5 mans are not that hard.
---
Your right it is not an opinion, it is just flat out incorrect.
---
Why do you think people on private servers push so hard for threat, dual wielding tanks and the like?
---
You telling me you think every warrior can just spam execute on Vael with no threat issue whatsoever?
---
just don't break it when some UD rogue fool will be corpse camping you in stv :)
---
Something that's helped me is an insta *not to be named* server so I could just try out a little of everything, and realize why I'm going rogue on launch. My curiosity will never be lower... that said, it's not zero because I understand how much more I know about rogue than every other class.

Seems to run a lot better over long distances with slower connections. Must be in the way it prioritizes input lag.
---
I just don't see it. As an avid PvPer throughout all of WoW I have never once used visual gear as an indication of what I'm about to go up against when I'm charging at an enemy player (Thunderfury aside)
---
I'm usually looking at their health pool to get a good idea.
---
You could play 16 hours a day with 6-7 hours for sleep and be at around 9 days played. The record is 4 days 20 hours with 0 help, with help, and in the current beta Joana is about 15 hours ahead of his previous record, as are many others.

"Before patch 1.2, druid armor scaled horribly. Patch 1.2 changed armor scale from 65% to 180% for Bear Form and 125% to 360% for Dire Bear Form.  " Since we have 1.12 for classic the druid scales "HORRIBLY"?
---
I'll be doing that and levelling skinning/herb - you'll miss out on using useful engineering stuff while levelling but it will be much faster to do it as 60. At lvl60 I'll drop skinning and take disenchanting for all the greens I banked after I bought my mount, then drop that for engineering.
---
Engineering is pretty essential for PVP as every PVPer will be taking it since every other PVPer will have it. You can of course play without it, but being able to reflect frost/shadow spells, stun at range and use the helm/boots will win you more fights than anything any other profession can give you. My mage alt will have herb/alchemy to help with my potion addiction :)
---
Never said they were but they're far from "piss poor" and can keep up with mages pretty well in naxx.

Some people in this thread seem to be completely ignoring the fact that guilds are social structures, and there's a lot of community building outside of just raiding.  Having a point of contact that is a known good player of their class is extremely valuable for everybody in the guild from total noobs to officers, and it has almost nothing to do with being a raid leader or "micromanaging" people.
---
^ Here is the real reason.
---
Seems so but perhaps someone has some suggestions. Streamer servers are a logical choice but of course none of us want them to be the driving soul of communities in this game
---
and thats why i'm rolling warlock
---
I've been using the previous version (same size and aspect ratio, but one step lower resolution) to play several mmos over the last year. It's pretty great, honestly.
---
This comment right here makes me want to stick with tailoring while I level. That + herbalism. Thanks!
---
Just might be the safest bet
---
Yeah I meant original Vanilla, but maybe the etiquette has changed on private servers. I'll maintain that leveling a Warrior isn't as bad as people would make it seem. It's slow, but you'll have plenty of money if you're doing quests so there's no reason to reserve loot in a dungeon simply because you rolled a slower leveling class. To me, the only time I'd request an item reservation, or accept someone else doing so, is if they're only running the dungeon for one specific piece of gear and everyone else that could possibly use it is completely fine with them taking priority.
---
Called autocorrect kiddo.
---
Warriors can DPS but finding a tank is a lot harder than finding a DPS so it is expected of feral druids and dps warriors to go bear form/put on their shield.
---
Honestly I see all these posts about min/max for raids and I'm like shadowmelded + mind control = the real min max
---
This is the real way grass is greener works. Like, you'll frequently see a classes best or worst depending on how they stack against you in the rock/paper/scissors paradigm, especially if you see someone who knows what they're doing. 
---
Your example is great. From my perspective:
---
So a mage sitting there AoEing so you can't open as a rogue, or god-for-freaking-bid they catch you out of stealth, and suddenly it's like, shit mages have *all* the tools. But you catch him drinking or something? Rogues are OP scum, and now and forever KOS.

We're also not factoring in Adrenaline Rush into this. That cooldown will mean more Backstabs, which means more Combo Points that don't need to be spent on SnD, which means more Eviscerates, which means more ticks of 25 bonus Energy and more bonus Combo Points.

LF a guild that is open to casual players and also planning for a dedicated raid team. I am not looking for a guild that is focused on min-maxing or ensuring that members are online a specific amount of time. I would like some breathing room for IRL responsibilities and to be able to come back to a home-away-from-home when I have the time.
---
Available **7PM PST Thu/Fri/Sat** due to class schedule.  I am married, so there will be weekends where I won't be available during the stated times. I will always make those dates known ahead of time when raid content begins. I will be unavailable during the first week of the game dropping (tragic) due to Burning Man.
---
Class(es): **Warlock** / **Mage** / **Rogue**
---
These are the classes I am planning to play in order of preference. I will definitely be leveling a lock first.
---
PM me if my schedule works for you or if you have any other questions!
---
The game is entirely different from retail.  To pretend it's the same is complete and utter ignorance.
---
True, but damn to work for 2-3 hours in a dungeon just for an 8% drop chance on a piece of gear sucks. Couple that with being busy IRL and you're looking at weeks or months to get that set.
---
I’m with you here
---
Oh I’m prepared. I’m sick of new media story-telling where horrendous events are revoked by some deus ex machina bullshit. Bring me the older despair-ridden stories!
---
Yep, it also turns out mana tide totem isn't very good in a melee group. We are just learning things every day! 
---
But man are we going to miss some spell crit and a point in healing effectiveness. */shrug*
---
But hey, you strike me as someone who knows everything so I am not saying anything you don't already know.
---
But WoW players don't go out in public...
---
when i leveled on nost, crusader on average wasn't worth the mana cost of judging it and putting up seal of righteousness because you only got a few swings of righteousness on a mob anyways. 
---
at higher levels it was kind of the same, on elites i would judge crusader, put up seal of command and the elite would die well into that debuff time (if i was solo, not in a dungeon group) but for regular mobs you just keep command up, judge on cooldown and prioritize hoj before judges whenever you can. 
---
as for judging wisdom/light then swinging with crusader, it was always better to judge wisdom/light then swing with seal of wisom/light for more healing/mana.
---
hope this answers your questions.
---
Only reason I didn't include them was because it's been so long since I played one I don't remember their annoyances. I'm sure they have them though haha. Having to have a whole bag for soul shards might be one.
---
interesting idea.  As another time-limited player this could be appealing.  But if you're already home, you'd still have to set up the gaming PC turn it on, launch this app etc.  So if you're out somewhere your PC would already have to be on, right, and the app enabled for this to even be a thing?
---
That makes sense. I've been collecting mine in a spreadsheet so I will still need to create them in game when classic releases.
---
Keep defending yourself from stealing content I stop caring long ago.
---
Feral tank gear, yes.  Rogue dps gear,maybe, and only if you can compete with the rogues.
---
Eyes of the Beast!

Imagine trying to heal with that thing. Jesus.

Yeah, ACE forensic Certification and ICND1... real life problems 😭😭

this is why you roll druid who can do everything
---
Ok wtf? So you're under the impression that Officers are only relevant during raid nights? 
---
&gt;"this is a good player of this class, they are *responsible* for helping people of this class when asked" 
---
Explain to me why an Officer can't help the person in question?
---
&gt;They help connect officers to other good players of that class
---
Explain to me what the point of this is?
---
&gt;The goal is to offer those *in need of help* a point of contact that isn't an officer 
---
But why ask someone that isn't an Officer? I mean fuck, the Holy Pally over there can just as easily ask any of the other H Pallys in the guild (that isn't the Healing O), any question about random buff "X" if he's too nervous to ask the O, but again, *WHY*? What purpose does it serve? The point of the Healing O is to be on top of the Pally Buffs (or any other redundant scenario), even if he happens to be a Priest.
---
&gt;Officers have more important things to be doing than answering simple redundant questions
---
That's not even remotely true, unless the people you're playing with are a bunch of assholes with sticks up their asses.
---
&gt;That's only \~15-20 core "upper management" 
---
That's literally a direct fucking quote. And if the 8 Class Leads aren't helping run the guild wtf are they even doing? If they ARE helping run the guild, then that's just too many cooks in the kitchen. Either way it's pointless.
---
You were the only one having your tourist-only discussion. I was never a part of it and maintain that you have no fucking idea what you're talking about.

Just put a post it note over portrait
---
Speaking off, is the uh, feature where casting that totem while falling stops you in mid-air so you can avoid fall damage, in the Classic build, or was that changed by 1.12?
---
This ridiculous, everyone knows that you can't get the classic experience without playing in a 4:3 15" monitor. GAWD.
---
It takes the whole damn horde to do it, too. 
---
"If this motherfucker bubbles one more time, I'm picking up my toys and going home."
---
I honestly don’t see the appeal in having monitors this big. But, more power to you! See you in classic!
---
Dear fuck you guys are brutal. I sit on my bed, lean on piled up pillows and use a textbook as my mousepad while I play for hours at a time.
---
R/roastme
---
there are some big pvp guilds from the big pservers that are rolling classic, I'd suggest rolling on one of those regardless of faction
---
The only thing is the whole non "blizz like" experience you get running a server that has a larger cap than vanilla did.  It's all in a balance for resources as well.  If you have 2x the players on a server than spawns are designed, you need to effectively produce 2x the resources/enemies/etc to support that.  
---
It's a really hard thing to balance out.  There's really no situation that wins on all counts.

Nah, the biggest problem is shitty mitigation, shitty TPS, shitty sustain and no defensive cooldowns. Taunt is fairly low on the list.

Dwarf Priest - dual gathering professions until lvl 60 mount &gt; Tailoring/Engi after that
---
... they aren't launching 100 servers. That + layering should ensure no servers are dead this time next year.
---
You'll be fine.
---
My time machine so I can jump forward to Aug 26th.
---
awesome rant and lots of good points. I've never heard of people bothering to skip with some locks to summon everyone, that's some confidence in your team not wiping and using wipe prevention properly. I was only thinking of bosses originally, but the C'thun trash is definitely next level bullshit. I especially remember it being a problem because people would AFK during trash (as they always have and will, especially DPS...) so you'd be doing this with less than 40 for sure, more like 30 people. It wasn't a matter of if people would die, but how many people. I remember having times waiting to click release watching the mayhem unfold as those packs ripped people apart. 
---
Yea, I remember hearing about removing the floor by Skeram. It was a pretty big story at the time since clearing C'thun weekly was still very valuable for guilds but it was a huge slog to get through the rest of the content.
---
I have Parsec set to start on my gaming PC when I turn it on, it doenst stream until you connect to it. So when I leave for work I turn it on. Unfortunately, my motherboard does not support MagicPackets. If it did, I'd have a remote on my phone that could send a packet to my gaming PC to turn the PC on.
---
Gift wrapped. Worth 1g just to open and see
---
Nah. I can stick with one class for decades. Always have
---
Only worry about bringing a paladin to NE starting area - if the starting area doesn't have that starting class, you don't have trainers.
---
If you're a serious speedrunner, you should not be rolling Alliance.
---
Until I hit on rogue, I was a horrible altoholic, but after I got around to making/getting invested in a rogue I don't think I ever leveled another character past 20.
---
Damn this is already something I never thought of. Thanks!
---
Yes :P
---
&gt;unless there are major mistakes being done or you are progressing
---
Okay, so you progress through MC the first time. There are some threat issues. Your tank is in defense focused gear and unable to provide adequate threat for warriors to go all out with recklessness, death wish, execute. Especially on Rag where he is wearing FR gear and almost no threat. Okay, progression through MC done. Now, you clear MC a second time. Magically all threat issues disappear? How does that work?  
---
Later on, ZG releases. Warlocks get hit capped and start making insane threat with their shadow bolt spam. But somehow this is not noticed at all?hy?  
---
There are plenty of fights in BWL that benefit from increased threat. Broodlord, chromaggus, Vael, even drakes. Nefarian if you have bad luck on class calls.   
---
Your insistence that threat is not an issue means absolutely nothing. Having more threat is clearly a benefit when Chromaggus goes vulnerable to shadow for the third time in a row and all your warlocks are unable to cast spells.  
---
Or when you get three pally class calls in a row and can't put any threat on the boss.  
---
Or to kill Vael faster and smoother, saving buffs on your tanks since they don't die to BA.  
---
Or to not have threat issues on Broodlord who constantly knocks threat off the tank.
---
And how do you propose I do that?
---
Likewise. Shadow priest is a class I've considered, mainly with a focus on pvp. I've messed around with them leveling and the occasional world pvp but never really focused on the class. My problem with SP is that it seems like a class with very few active abilities, and that game play might get repetitive when compared to what you can do as a lock or mage. Do more experienced shadow priest players find that to be the case or what am I missing here?
---
Agree it's a waste of time, but night elves, druids and rogues would be able to easily hide until they can get the buffs and HS out when they have it.
---
Would still require you to know when the quest is turned in a having the priest to do the MC.
---
Fem Human Warrior main and a Spriest alt are all I'll need. Covers all my bases quite well. Both have a great class fantasy, and I can fill any role whenever I choose to. Melee DPS, Tank, Heal, or rDPS. But most of all, both are an absolute blast in PvP!

[https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/)  ya man so far behind
---
Absolutely. The difference is very noticeable and 1440 @144hz is the sweet spot. With your gpu you will stay capped at that buttery smooth 144hz.
---
You can actually make a one button macro for attack/follow. I'm big on having a button for everything but trust me, there's no reason to have two bindings for this. The macro says "attack this guy, no wait come back, okay attack this guy, now this guy, now attack that, no wait come back" all with one button. I like Mouse Back or Tilde.
---
The best cinematic in gaming history is the original WoW cinematic.
---
You can alert of hordes attacking Goldshire even before the game alerts it
---
Again no content in your reply. You said you do not care at all about the downvotes but look at you
---
I am done with you. You are a waste of time. Ill be the better person and just block you. Again have a better life
---
&gt;A system with limited debuff slots and separate, unique, and equal debuffs to apply, could be interesting.
---
That's really all my point is. Maybe it wasn't intentional but I think the implications of that kind of system would be a positive if used correctly. Stick it in the barrel of classic+ ideas that will never see the light of day.
---
The only reason we are here is because of Blizzard
---
I'm trying to finish life.
---
It won't be like the old days where you open the server list and there's 60 options. There will only be a few of each type, per region. It'll be a more consistent experience across servers. The smallest server will still be pretty damn active once layering ends, unlike Vanilla where there were dozens of totally dead servers they had to provide free transfers for.
---
1) inner focus is 100% better then 2% spell damage reduction for sure.
---
2) i think imp fort and imp mana burn is better then holy crit %
---
You can make a macro for Attack/Follow, there's no reason to have it on two different bindings.
---
Ignore him. I just did. He was proven wrong and got very angry
---
I am sorry you have to deal with that
---
If you could make it work with spell batching, using rank 1 SotC -&gt; rank 1 SoC would give you maximum SoC damage at SotC speeds for 76 mana per swing. Assuming you use full buffs, consumables and potions, that's just about a serviceable cost even for longer boss fights.
---
However, I think that if something like this was possible, hardcore theorycrafters would have discovered it by now.
---
BfA left such a bad taste in my mouth, that was building since Legion
---
I was surprised to find myself excited for Classic. I plan on  leveling with no concerns for raiding. As far as I’m concerned endgame is nonexistent
---
Tribute runs in DM:N with stealth grp(druids/rouges) or a priest using Mind Soothe to skip packs or like 5 hunters xD but who does that.
---
Consider troll if you dont care about pve, its pretty meta for pvp spriests now the racial spell is nuts
---
That is definitely how I'm gonna do things. I have my own healer for the first week. I expect to easily be able to find people :)

It’s very possible, you just make a prediction.  I don’t have to know football teams to make a prediction on how will win a game...  it may not be accurate but it’s still a prediction
---
You apply SW;P and VT and stand still laughing at your enemy trying to break your PW:S.
---
I get that, I've primarily been PvP'ing in my WoW time too. But I'm talking about what an MMO**RPG** should be like in my eyes. This is a distinction that is important to make because Classic WoW was when WoW was the most RPG and, personally, over the years I've noticed that I like WoW because it's an RPG and not just because I like the PvP or the PvE.
---
So when it comes down to what does and doesn't fly for me in MMORPG design, I consider it from the perspective of someone designing and RPG and not just a PvP or PvE game. In that sense, transmogging is not a system I want to be in the game.
---
Paladins make great "5th man" members. Bring utility and act like a good WTF button since they can soak damage pretty well and heal if needed.
---
Do you think people are going to be running through them like retail? Lol
---
How do you not understand newfield in Alberta? They all live/work out here!

Countdown to classic is pretty solid. Punkrat and meta goblin are both informative as well. All three can be found on YouTube.
---
[Countdown to Classic](https://open.spotify.com/show/38mHWjscNorJr7OFeNu8X5) is a great podcast

You have stormstrike for that OMEGALUL

Oh, perhaps then. Blacksmithing never had anything take that long.

Play what you like... I feel like my priest should be undead, but that’s recommended for pvp and I dont
---
This is different. This is literally streaming your PC. WoW is running on your gaming PC. You are just remoted into the gaming PC. GeoForce now and other cloud streaming are you are running the game on THEIR PC/Server setup, not your own.
---
I would like to Raid NAX. I 1st played wow during Wrath and got about 2 weeks of NAX before the next raid dropped. I enjoyed it. I want to experience the 3-4 hour raid nights wiping on the 1st boss 🤣😂🤘🍻🤬🤬
---
Ideally, Id like a system where players are not limited in the dots they can cast, but every class only have 1 "debuff" they can throw up on the boss.
---
So two tiers of debuffs, one for damage over time and another for indirect maluses like armor, resistance, slower attack speed, etc. Make 9 debuffs, allow 5 on a boss, with some bosses only allowing 3 others 6 or whatever.
---
No one wants to not be able to do their rotation, that isnt fun.
---
I didn't mean to compare moba and fps with mmorpg, don't worry.
---
I'm fine with classes having downsides, it promotes a good gameplay. This doesn't imply that every class has to have a very dull/boring aspect.
---
Seriously, do CoS buffing holy as well. Buff the group damage of two class/specs who sorely need it, basically 0 impact in pvp since I'd rather get hit with CoS or CoE than Exhaustion or Toungs any day. Fuck #nochanges.
---
You just need to time the fights and bring the right consumables is all, it's very doable if you know what you're doing and offer good utility to the group other than your subpar dps
---
 I barely notice the difference between 1080 and 1440, but using 60hz even on the desktop makes me cringe. No chance I'll be playing WoW or any game in 60hz.
---
There are videos about how people made money the first few days of the new OSRS servers. They talked about gathering and selling to NPCs as a way to progress. Seems like an interesting concept to research.
---
Who said it was a sport?
---
lol wtf does that mace do?
---
That's what gouge is for.
---
I was wondering that for classic too. I bought a 34” Alienware monitor. My desk is smaller , so I found it way to big for my setup unfortunately. I went back to my 25”.. but it did look amazing. I have a laptop setup, razer with a rtx2070mq so not nearly as powerful as yours. It did drop my FPS significantly (still above 60fps) but I was playing BFA. I don’t think classic or your setup will have a huge difference. If you like 1440p monitors I would say go for it
---

Night Elf reporting in.  Start your MC cast from the shadows.

Pathetic and unsolicited.  The people I'm looking at forming a guild with all agree class leaders are a good role to have. It was never up for debate, and defending the legitimacy of a role that has existed since the launch of the game seems... silly.
---
Necromancer was added as DLC but he was included with the Switch edition that I bought.

---
Once you have THC and assuming you have no other weapon skill from gear or talents, the Human Sword Specialization racial is worth 0.2% hit, 0.2% crit, and 6% more damage on Glancing Blows. 
---
No one can really speculate about Fury damage in Classic, it remains to be seen if they really will be the top melee DPS class.
---
For a Rogue, if you're getting all those world buffs and have BIS everything, you definitely aren't speccing combat and you might not even be using swords.
---
Come on mate, it's an honest question and I'm curious to know.
---
I don't think I'll have or want to put in the time and effort to have an alt with profession capabilities. I'm pretty set on ending up Eng/herb. Is the idea that most greens will DE into materials worth more than their AH/Vendor price? Also, in classic you can DE at a skill  level of 1 no matter the item level, correct? If so that's a good idea to make some extra gold when making the switch to engineering.
---
I keep seeing the same excuse, 'its pay to win' 
---
What if he made enough gold on retail to fund all his accounts then whats the excuse for he cant do it ? xD
---
Even a good chunk of tier gear is awful for PvE. Many classes will wear an assortment of offset pieces and crafted gear until AQ40 or even Naxx.
---
lol that's a bingo
---
So even taking away the idea that if I'm tanking the group, I don't want you along to take my mail/plate, warrior dps is just not that great in groups pre raid gear. In small groups, utility is at a premium, and an additional warrior brings 0 utility that the tank doesn't bring. Combine that with the fact your dps is pretty meh, you need to be in a multi target environment that lets you cleave and WW to even start catching up to the rogues and other real dps classes.
---
But none of that really matters, since tanks can basically build their own groups and keep you out of them while not keeping the group waiting, because it takes 2 seconds to find a dpser.
---
Frost is by far the easiest leveling spec(even before 20). Slows give a lot of utility and extends kite time before you have to deal with melee mobs. Add in the survival talents deeper down the tree and its a bit of a slam dunk on the easy scale.
---
Arcane is a great for sustain, but isn't flashy. Dipping Frost you won't benefit much from Presence of Mind, but it does have some uses.  Overall, Arcane Frost is probably a good build choice for your group. Most notably, you are low on heals(with your doubting friend). Frost slows would go a long way to allowing the warrior stay in combat and run out of range when he gets aggro. Avoid frostbite as a rooted enemy will attack what is nearby, while a slow enemy would still chase you or the hunter if either of you manage to keep threat(letting the warrior go ham). Arcane will help make keep mana throughout the fight and when you get to the bottom offers some DPS boost.
---
My recommendation would be to get your early Frost talents then go full Arcane if that's what you are thinking. Start  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/--0500003](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/--0500003) or  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/--0520003301](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/--0520003301) before going down to Arcane Power  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2300552010031531--0520003301](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2300552010031531--0520003301). A reasonable 60 build could be  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2300552010031531--0535003301](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2300552010031531--0535003301).
---
Fair warning, rotation wise this will be boring AF. You will cast Frostbolt, a lot. Move on your action bar where the spell is, otherwise you'll wear a hole right through that 1 key. None of the Arcane spells are worth casting. They cost high mana and the damage just isn't there. Arcane Explosion might see some use, but typically as a panic spam button while you are on your last leg.
---
For me, Mage is fun because of the situations he can get into, not so much his rotation. Going Fire/Frost will probably give you more buttons to press, but going Arcane/Frost will probably give your group more options with slows + high mana sustain.
---
Your GPU has very little to do with your Classic framerate in comparison to your CPU.

150 bucks for 1440p? that's a no thanks for me.
---
I have a 1070 so our cards are pretty similar in power. 
---
I just made the switch from a 24" 1080p 144hz to a 27" 1440p 144hz and the monitor is stunning. My only issue with it is that the text on normal windows scaling is sooooooo tiny, but WoW looks great on it and runs in a lot of spots at 144hz. 
---
You might also want to consider a 32" 1440p monitor. You can find them sometimes for $300 if you hunt for deals. They have about the same pixel density of a 24" 1080p monitor.

Imagine actually dying to 15 year old raid content lol
---
If you can't perform in a raid, then why should anyone listen to you?  Knowing your class is the first and most important step.
---
Warlock problems: requiring a full support team to AoE rather than just soloing down pac, having the wrong pet out at the wrong time (oops had succu out when that mage jumped me), resummoning pets, 0 mobility, having to spec for burst..I love warlock, but the grass certainly isn't greener.
---
The percentage of people that run at 144hz is incredibly low.  Steam won't show you resolutions, but for comparison, only 4% of people run at 1440p.  Having a video card that puts you at 144hz @ 1440p is the minority.
---
With layering i am personally more worried about lopsided servers horde vs aliance then under populated. it seems like layering will help with the initial rush of tourists but still will not effect faction balance.
---
Yea if you were using the original client. I’m pretty sure the new modern client is optimized to utilize more of the gpu.
---
I think herb while leveling is better than using cloth/money to invest in a prof you only want for bags. Others will sell/you can give mats and get the bags for much cheaper than dumping all the cloth and skill level investment into tailoring
---
Getting full T0 is far more of a hardcore goal than getting an assortment of non-set gear that is far better than T0.
---
This is so underrated - needs more upvotes
---
Consumables and buffs that are tagged as *"magic"* can be dispelled by Garr in MC.
---
And the only reason Blizzard did Classic is because the community wanted it.
---
I agree with Countdown to classic and Punkrat. Metagoblins is pretty bad imo. Nothing unique about his content tbh.  
---
I am not fan of ClassicCast either, Tips' videos are ok but the other 2 are really bad.
---
PlatinumWow is someone I would really recommend to watch as his videos are great fun.
---
Yeah, I'm just excited for all the little side things that fill out/enrich the game, especially with the class I've loved for years. Poisons weren't *terrible* to level, IIRC. Lockpicking is a bitch and a half, though, and it's why it'll be a nice wee achievement, relative to other rogues, when I get it done. Idk, retail stripped away so much from rogue that I'm here for all of it, the tedious and the abundance of CDs, too.
---
It's just a meme in the community that putting so much effort into something is autistic, that's all.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
Take your god damned upvote.
---
Honestly man, been seriously considering the same. Was considering a career change anyways, but the timing just lines up pretty well, tbh. Props to you and enjoy it. If I do the same, I figure I'll just take Sept off and start anew in Nov. Man, that sounds wonderful actually...
---
I was from Smolderthorn horde Requiem. Best of luck finding your friends. There is a website for this that I am sure someone will link you.
---
I'm not so sure a 2060 would be capped at 144hz @ 1440p at max quality.  A 1080 is slightly higher performance than a 2060, and I'm not even capped at 60hz @ 1440p in the middle of a raid with most settings maxed out.
---
You can probably hit 144hz @ 1440p with a 2060 at medium-ish settings in a raid setting though.

The streamers won't be announcing the servers they're on so honestly you're just gonna have to leave it up to chance.
---

Compared to what?

Pservers removed WCB cooldown like a little over a year ago, people were doing this shit all the back on nost.

No, it really isn't. And we're not even getting BFA's multicore optimization.

---
Soap is fattening
---
&gt; it doesn't change the fact that you are hanging on to obsolete gear until lvl70.
---
It's not obsolete. Naxxramas gear (not weapons though) is perfectly viable to start raiding in TBC. Believe it or not people used it to down Karazhan bosses. 
---
&gt; Casual players was a bad term to use, I meant people who play 15 hours per week. As opposed to those who play that every day. If those players work and work and then before they have a chance TBC classic launches and it is all about the dark portal again
---
If you play 15 hours/week you can still clear Naxxramas at release day.
---
&gt; And the creation of seperate servers doesn't change the fact that most of the player base will switch to TBC.
---
So wait, let me understand, you think most people would rather play TBC and you don't want them to be able to enjoy what they want. Seems pretty selfish to me.
---
Protip for life: Clean more often than every eleven years you slob
---
Honestly, out of any class, Rogue definitely benefits most from WOTF. Priest and Locks are brutal for rogue only you can A) stunlock them to death fully or B) WOTF.  
---
If I rogue, it'll be undead as well. Even if Orc is super sweet for rogue vs. rogue matchups.
---
Oretty misleading though. Sense it really only matters the class balance per faction. If you filter results by faction, Paladin is 3rd highest for Alliance and only by 0.01% to 2nd place, and Shaman is 2nd most populated class for Horde.
---
Private server data is a little different where the popular servers show Paladin and Shaman being either 3rd place or barely losing to be 4th most popular class on their respective factions. They just look unpopular because 100% of their population is specific to their faction while all other classes have the combined population of Alliance and Horde playing said class.
---
I made this a while back which uses the raw data from the survey. https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/
---
You're just repeating the same things over and over without explaining what a Rogue Class Leader can do that the MDPS Officer can't (other than "not being an Officer"), or why they're important (other than "to help the rogues" ???).
---
&gt;nevermind the fact that this was never a discussion about whether class leaders are a good thing to have in a guild or not.
---
You're right. I went on a complete tangent. To answer your question, you should familiarize yourself with every aspect of Priest, be it Shadow PvP, Shadow PvE, Tank Healing, Raid Healing, PI Spec, down-ranking, buff management, dispel management, relevant addons (healbot, decursive, etc), WoW's new default raid frames and how to properly manage them, heal priority (MT &gt; OT &gt; Healers &gt; DPS), which spells to never use (Renew), which niche spells to use and when (Renew), Class Quests (Benediction), important must-have gear while leveling 1-59 (Gravestone Scepter),  which spells/skills your Priests can skip while leveling up to save gold (Resurrection rank 2+, Mana Burn, MC, etc), proper leveling builds (Wand Spec into Shadow), and more. 
---
I just feel like all of the above can be performed by a dedicated Healing Officer, or literally any priest in the guild if another priest has a specific question. (other than the Shadow stuff, which should be handled by RDPS O imo).
---
Good luck with your guild and your goals.
---
Good advice, but not everyone lives paycheck to paycheck and with a little planning and discipline it's totally reasonable to take a month off. Especially if he doesn't have kids, etc.
---
Boom boom ciao
---
It wasent in vanilla wow, so no it wouldnt be true to classic
---
well really we dont know yet,
---
best thing to do is to play around in retail to test a bit, probably in the  old zones
---
Parsec is an amazing piece of software, it even allows you to play a splitscreen game with someone not at your house.
---
You shouldn't compare a feral tank to a main tank prot warrior.  Your ideal position is more main off tank.  Because fights need a different number of tanks you can't just have a shit ton of prot warriors  that would severely gimp you on the fights that need less tanks. This is the role you fill, you'll off tank the fights where more tanks are needed and do okay dps or dispel on the fights where you don't need to tank.  A prot warrior will beat you at tanking(mostly), a fury warrior will beat you at dps, neither will beat you at both.
---
You can maintank many fights that you out gear and produce more threat than a prot so the dps can kill it faster making raiding take less time.  
---
You also don't compete with wars for prot gear making getting all the tanks geared easier.
---
Tbh vanilla was the only time I wasnt a total altoholic, maybe tbc too.
---
Leveling and gearing took so long that you couldnt just decide to 'main' something else and within a week have that new class at max level with decent gear like in retail.
---
I’m Vanilla and TBC I played a Night Elf Rogue.  I always envied Humans for their sword spec, but I still topped meters in raids and got 2200 in arena in TBC.
---
Play what you want, but be sure that you want it.
---
No one expects Starshards from stealth!
---
Anyone who doesnt see how everything that comes out of tipsout's stupid face is complete garbage cannot be trusted.
---
As someone suffering with austism I don't really find it distasteful or shitty at all. It's just a harmless joke and honestly an easy way to describe something.

Your best test is probably to run around Outland. Since the old world got redone in cata, they’re basically only out since 2010, whereas Outland goes back to 07. Not sure if there have been any updates for Outland or northrend since then but just a thought
---
Bro.. ikea. They have great deals on furniture that will take hours to build. Not only do you get a great price.. but each of the 10 boxes is packed with activities!
---
In what world, do you think it will take that long to level?
---
I know the record is 4 days and such but that was 10 years ago. So many new strategies and paths have been found. Private server reset and someone leveled in 2.5 days. It’s not the same but 3 days /played is completely doable
---
Gonna go Priest at launch, tailor/enchant. According to this [WoW classic guide website](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/priest/leveling-1-60/), "You'll make a ton of friends as a priest ;-)."
---
Do you see a difference between knowing how to play and mastering something? I see.
---
Modern players have more data, good addons, they have fucking youtube, twitch etc. The learning curve is completely dependent on the availability of information. It's only one specific example. 
---
Also if we are talking about some bullshit like skill ceiling, we must admit that there are other mmos, where 90% of the mechanics are exactly the same. So people have played privates and other mmos for a fucking decade at least.
---
More like auto-incorrect granpa.
---
Yep, after 3 months people will be geared and be running through dungeons with ease, no cc needed, for most packs that is. It wont be like retail where you can pull a whole island and be fine, no. But it will be done mostly with no problem at all, yes.
---
Sure you can.
---
16 * 5 - 1 = 79 bag slots.
---
That's 1580 Runecloth.
---
It would take you 79 minutes to turn them all into Runecloth Bandages.
---
I run a 1440p@144hz on a RTX2060. You won't regret it.
---
I can tell you the combination works wonderfully together.  The 2060 is definitely strong enough to push the monitor in all but a few games in ultra.  The biggest limiter will be your CPU though in vanilla, unless they open up multi-threading on classic release, you won't be able to cap the GPU out for it.
---
Be warned, you will never want a 1080p or 60hz monitor ever again after the change... It really is mind blowing how much better gaming is after the upgrade.
---
It's a 1st tier talent in shadow with five levels, each level gives +2% chance of your shadow spells stunning your target for 3 seconds. If you're an undead priest it will proc from your Touch of Weakness self buff, if you're a troll priest it can proc from your shadowguard which means you get three 10% chances of stunning any attacker.
---
Who said I would be sitting for that long?  I have an experiment regiment planned for sitting, standing, stretching. I have a standing desk and a sitting one. 
---
I plan to stay healthy while playing
---
I think Ranger is another vanilla montage. For private server pvp: Goth, Greatwizard, Rup, Aftershock
---
If your Undead, don't use Devouring Plague on anything Dwarven if there's another target around. They can just Stoneform it off.
---
&gt; (Youtube videos of raiding in vanilla as a Feral Druid are welcome!) 
---
You won't find any.
---
All are from private servers, which are as reliable as...Druid tanking.
---
So, totally unreliable.
---
What makes you think that?
---
Because you couldn’t leave that fast, no one can?
---
PvP shadow they most certainly do!  Shadow meld&gt; mc off ab.  Fear ward and instant half health heal makes you even harder to kill.  Also stomeform to laugh at all the rogues and UD shadow priests.
---
If you are running 5 mans you should have your pets taunt key bound. Always useful for helping your healer on hectic pulls.
---
Actually if Stormstrike stayed on the target and affected all incoming Nature damage, that would be pretty neat.  Give a little boost to Shaman, Balance, and Rogues.
---
The Witcher 3. I still haven't beaten it. If I don't by launch day, I never will.
---
If you haven't played a restore shaman then you don't know shit about how to heal as a shaman.  You might think you can just read a guide and know, but there's lots of bad information out there.  You cannot even test shit to see if it makes sense.
---
No, I do believe you're right. I meant that it's reasonable to wait a month to start his new job, if his current financial situation supports it.
---
My dreams of being an epic Smite priest can come true!
---
What? So what you're saying is that ML = FFA, but items can be traded? I think you misunderstand.
---
Since there are no Alliance shamans in Classic, I will play druid. Oh, by the way, fuck Horde scum :P
---
Bite has higher damage/focus but would never cast after the initial hit due to claws lower focus cost. If you really want to maximize this negligible damage turn of claws' autocast and use it only to manually dump focus when bite is on cooldown.
---
Really? Must be my subconsciousness protecting me from the reality that a Shadow Priest can kill me with SW:P alone.
---
I typically use pattern based passwords on my numpad. It's just irregular and won't get brute forced as easily
---
Countdown to Classic. Also, I didn’t do twitch much before, but Kevin Jordan (original Vanilla Class Designer) streams regularly. Highly recommend.
---
I understand, but unless the proc rate is near 50% then you’re better off just casting the spell.  Don’t get me wrong it’s a cool item but honestly would just be used for fun or trolling like you said
---
You are dreaming.
---
Mind sharing your macro?
---
LoL no it wouldn't, all that would do is make it easier for people to pick the dominant faction on a server.
---
Stormstrike being slightly tweaked like that would push Elemental and Balance into viability, probably.
---
Man how cool would it have been to pull Surge of Light from TBC into the vanilla holy tree.
---
I am 100% sure what is my alt...tauren Hunter like always. But dont know what choose for main, warrior, rogue or feral druid. What is more fun of those? and what is more challenge to master?.
---
Dude. Im a hunter. I wanna roll need on everything. The dice button is sexiest thing in the world
---
&gt; I benchmarked the Classic Beta to help you asses
---
I said "ok" because you seemed to start talking about a different topic. Imp windfury totem came up, I said a thing about it, and you replied with "you don't have to be deep resto to heal"? Just seems like a non sequitur or maybe you replied to the wrong comment
---
You haven't debunked shit
---
Ragnaros will knock back and deal big damage to any mana user. Because of this rets typically can not dps on Ragnaros and heal instead.
---
How does a raid of ret pallys kill rag?
---
This user screeches in every thread that crops about Druids. He lacks a basic understanding of the class, and uses faulty math to reeee about how private servers are inaccurate. Every single one of his points has been disproven repeatedly, but he is on some weird crusade to screech as much as possible. Ignore him.
---
The rule is: If the class can be an Orc, roll an Orc
---
I'll be rolling Warrior with Tailoring/Enchant.  I'll be rolling through lots of dungeons so the blues and greens will be plenty...
---
Casters: Having to drink all the time.
---
Melee: Dying all the time.
---
Hunters: Doing nothing all the time.
---
I love you. Thank you!
---
It should do, the spell is listed in the shadow tree but I haven't noticed it proc blackout. The problem with DP is that dwarves just stoneform out of it and paladins take great pleasure in cleansing it as soon as you cast it.
---
Eh it's not something I personally need to know.
---
I am okay with imbalance in either direction. If I'm on a horse dominated server I can reap the rewards by leveling quickly.
---
If it's alliance dominated than I get to be the underdog and feel real satisfaction when successfully 2v1ing out in wPvP.
---
Really? You think a well rounded Healing Officer, responsible for being knowledgeable with all Vanilla healing classes, can't help little Timmy with his questions about his Rsham?
---
&gt; There's no such thing as "too many" to remove layering.. 
---
Yes there is, Blizzard is using it for a reason. Their servers can't handle more than 3000k at a time.
---
Also read the title of the thread
---
I had the same reaction.. why am I tearing up.. must be the music..
---
So then what was the point of layering if they do that?
---
Looks great.
---
I never said that, but if 2 equally skilled rogues fought and 1 of them was an Orc, they will probably win
---
Plus soul shards.
---
Off for 2 weeks, LAN party launch, game for first few days, then a mixture of seeing people and playing, off cycling in France the second week for a few days for some fresh air and countryside then back to play some more. Balance innit.
---
That's nice, but your site is still full of malware and adware with zero intent on changing that.
---
Back in Sunwell, I respecced 4 times a raid. (Pala) guild paid hapilly for both the flasks and spec costs.
---
The mage/rogue thing is really funny, because I've found while levelling up my mage (Currently 40), once I got Ice Block and Cold Snap rogues were much easier to deal with even if they did catch me drinking (As long as it wasn't a cold blooded one shot), it led to a pretty fair fight.
---
If there are queues though wouldn't that mean layering was a bad idea and didn't work anyway?
---
Its basically fine before you start getting to the harder hitting stuff at 60.
---
In earlier dungeons they can actually be better sometimes.
---
You would go afk and D/C while crafting in vanilla.  not sure how classic will be.
---
lol, want even the worst
---
Speaking of complete garbage there is at least 3 content creators far worse than him like : StaySafe, Esfand, Alex(have to check if he still makes his toxic rants).
---
But my bad for not mentioning far better channels like MadSeasonShow or Frostadamus.
---
The healing officer coordinates healing in the raid, and is almost certainly one of the healing class leads.  I was the shaman class lead and healing officer.  Priests didn't come to me asking how to play, because I was not an expert on priest healing.  I sent them them to the first-class lead, who was also an officer of the guild.  Most of the class leads were officers, or became officers.
---
I'm hoping my leg heals so I can properly tie my workouts to playing classic like I planned (scale workouts with levels, deaths, and rare item drops) like I planned. That's about it.
---
You said it will be like retail and not like retail in the same breath my dude.  Also, something to consider is that this says the average group.  If you think someone who is hitting 60, getting bis dungeon gear, and clearing dungeons in the first three months is the ‘average’ group... you don’t know averages very well.
---
Ye that is why in my post I already said 'sometimes you just need to work out loot rules' no need to repeat it mate =D, most SM groups will be 4 warriors and a healer lol because no cloth user needs to run ARM for instance.
---
Interesting idea.  To make a diablo comparison...  The regular servers are "non-seasonal," and we periodically have a "seasonal" layer that eventually combines with the regular servers?
---
My house, got all the materials in the past weekend for the outside and get to start it this weekend!
---
Plus, healers had a hard time solo questing, so they had to respec often, which is costly.
---
I'm definitely excited for it! I've healed my entire career but looking forward to doing so on a new class, and especially looking forward to the shadow journey.
---
Why would people roll on a PvP server dominated by their preferred faction? Don't they want people to kill?
---
Oh yeah for sure, I tank if I'm making the group, if a group is ready 2 go and been spamming LF1M DPS for 30 minutes then of course a DPS warrior can come along.
---
it can still be a useful tool for launch when there are more people than a few months into the games lifespan
---
I think its closer to 2 hours, but I cannot say for sure.
---
Is this true? I did quite a bit of research before building my new rig and I'm currently playing on an Acer X27 (4k/144Hz) and from what I saw, most people who are running RTX cards now prefer 1440/144Hz. 1080 is dying, my dude.
---
No didnt bother with that one as I personally disagree with worldbuffs being abused the way they are on pservers
---
Damn I was guessing it'd just be a quick 1 second stun. 3 seconds is no joke! Thanks :D
---
Depends on how fast and lucky you are with Herbalism. Or if you can flip on the AH.
---
I think it'd be nice, but the idea isn't without its downsides.
---
Something to consider though is that a 'slippery slope' situation can easily be created by something like this.
---
*Example 1*
---
Server 1 is 48A:52H, new Alliance players may just opt out of that server choice and instead choose Server 2 (60A:40H). This compounds on itself as that first server slowly shifts more and more to the Horde's advantage.
---
*Example 2*
---
Server 1 has a few popular Horde raiding guilds committed to it on Day 1. Day 1 population is 25A:75H. Alliance players are so overwhelmed right out the gate that they quickly move away from the server to play elsewhere against more even odds. Day 50 population on Server 1 is 10A:90H with a FULL population indicator. New Alliance players are few and far between as they'd rather not sit in queue for a server that a) they haven't sunk any time into already, b) they're outnumbered 9 to 1 in WPVP, and c) their chances of putting together effective PVE raids is dimished due to the Horde taking up the majority of players for the online-player cap.
---
Allowing some players to *blindly* choose (not seeing any pop stats other than Full, High, etc) and allowing others to 'opt-in' to the more detailed population stats (using internet resources) may be wiser in the long-run.
---
Might be, 14 year old memories are bit hazy.
---
yeah, the better answer is to roll Nelf and shadowmeld into mindcontrol for EZ honor
---
Did I get lost and end up on your Facebook page?
---
They’re talking about the priest racials, not Berserking - Hex of Weakness is a spammable, ranged mini-Mortal Strike, and Shadowguard has a chance to proc Blackout on any attack (melee, ranged, or spell) with each orb. Devouring Plague does not outweigh those two spells.
---
Are you ok man? Feel free to send me a PM if you need someone to talk to. :)
---
Bold of you for your first post to have your face in it
---
Inner Focus matters a lot as undead SP to the point where it's almost mandatory just because it saves you 1k mana on a DP cast. It's also really good for trolls and you can do some cool combos with trinkets but it's not quite mandatory for trolls like it is for UD.
---
all of these responses make me wonder, is bite ever really worth it if you're not min/maxing your hotkeys to make sure bite is used when off cd before claw uses up all the focus?
---
Class envy!! Will be harder than ever, as it takes a massive amount of time to re-roll anything and start all over again without catch-up mechanics. Better choose first time right.
---
I will 100% have a million alts, but the plan is to get one character (priest) to 60 so that I have that high level character to support my lowbie alts.
---
Yeah if your Healing O is a fucking joke.
---
Who put poor madseason there?
---
Putting additional threat on 5 mobs is better aoe threat that a bit of avoidance lol.
---
So you are going to play wow for 144 hours in a two week period? Jesus man, it's just a game.
---
Thanks
---
oh, that's pretty cool actually
---
It's the internet my dude, are you really that surprised? No need to let all the BS on the internet offend you.
---
I was trying to come up with something facetious and tongue in cheek to say. But now I just want to know what meal you've been eating for the last several years.
---
How do you train your poisons?
---
It does on private servers at least.
---
I believe he was getting to the point where the extremist (racists) act like your race matters in terms of how good of a person you are/they think one race is inherently better than another, which is obviously not true.  Think you may need to chill out a bit
---
Be warned, that has a pittance of RAM in the face of modern web browser consumption - they may run into issues when simply looking things up on wowhead while playing.
---
This is soo bad for gaming
---
I hope you don't plan on doing PVP or raids
---
1 Feral druid tank is optimal.  Just like 1 priest is optimal.  You arent being carried.
---
I know. There are really no good Chests in Plate with +Healing. But before I wear a Cloth Robe I'd rather go naked. I'd maybe settle for Mail or just take a Plate Chest with Int and MP5.
---
Amen
---
All of it is T0 gear obtained for 5man dungeons and UBRS.
---
It really depends what you are looking for, in terms of goals you want to achive for classic.
---
Personally I always wanted to be competitive with other players in both pve and pvp eventho I've got a lot less time to invest. Both Mage and Warlock are perfect for this. R14 gear is on the same level as bwl loot (which you should get access to quite easily). They are also not dependend on any low chance instance drops in order to stay competitive.
---
Healing / hybrid classes (Druid, Priest, Shaman, Pally) are also always a very good pick for people with limited time, especially Shamans and Pallys. They are both in high demand for raids/dungeons and gearing them for pre raid bis is even easier then Mage/Warlock. However, in terms of raiding you will most likely be "forced" to heal.
---
Hunters are the easiest class to level and to solo things in the open world. With simple things like the hunter bow quest you can get a great powerspike and loot quite easily. However, Hunter raid spots are normally quite limited since Hunter is the weakest of all DPS classes in the long run. So be ready to have some strong competition there. Also a Hunter with R14 gear is technically better in some aspects then a Hunter with just access to BWL loot. It's relly minor, but when competing for 2-3 raid spots in a 40 man raid, this could make the difference. Ofc we are talking about guilds here, that take things serious.
---
Building a pc lol...
---
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING
---
Level 1 SWP is your friend. Use it to proc blackout on fleeing enemies or to give you time to cast MB and Max level SWP.
---
Yes.  There's way too much bad information out there for someone to just read some shit and thinks he knows what he is doing.
---
I will have a Night Elf warrior for tanking raids and leveling to 60.
---
I will have a human mage alt and *only* dedicate time to playing this single alt when I'm not playing my main. 
---
Mage because its completely different from warrior, super easy to level and farm with, and a great money maker. It will also give me a good dps character for raids. Human to see the human leveling zones.
---
Anyone else will probably never make it past level 10, like my bank alt.
---
Thanks, this is helpful.
---
Thanks for the kind words! Hope you get a lot of use out of the filters!
---
Are you saying that meters are a good indicator of performance in a raid for healers?
---
The last few weeks before TBC release, we went MC and got paladin loot from bosses even though we were a horde guild. Apparently paladin loot was put on the same loot-table right before TBC due to the introduction of horde paladins. We left the paladin T1 on Garr while trying to page a GM because we thought this was a bug. I think the item remained on the corpse for a few hours, but again this was in 2006 so memory is indeed hazy.
---
Are you under the impression that people just pick non-warrior DPS classes for fun, or because they can't find any more warriors?
---
Yes, warriors produce the most raw DPS under the right circumstances - all good guilds know this.
---
But what they also know, that you apparently don't, is that loot is scarce and needs to be split, and that you need ranged dps for plenty of boss fights (which in the case of locks or mages can easily compete with or even outdo warriors on many fights), but also various classes for niche purposes such as buffs or things like tranq/cr/innervate.
---
The prot paladin has absolutely no use. Their niche of aoe tanking is matched by a prot warrior with consumables/engineering, and both warriors and druids are much, much better at absolutely everything else.
---
I game on a laptop. Don’t tell me what to do. I don’t like being stuck at a desk.
---
Obviously, ML != FFA. However, items that drop from bosses can  be traded within a 2 hour window, just like on retail. So even though an item is master looted and assigned/handed-out, it can still be traded by people in the raid.
---
Honestly the original cinematic + hopping right in is ideal.
---
Some classic raid videos might be good for conveying that atmosphere as well, but honestly it's the vibe and lvling that suck people in.
---
The little private server name reference ofc
---
This, as cringy as it is after all these years, was one of the first videos I remember watching that got me into WoW. I didn’t know much about WoW when I watched it, but it got me hooked 
---
https://youtu.be/sug4QLrwk-Y
---
Perfect, thanks guys, Countdown is exactly what I was looking for :)
---
They preform well in the leveling dungeons. They actually have better threat then warriors early on.   Sometimes you see them in niche rolls.
---
However eventually they lose out because their threat cant keep up with the DPS and they have no crush mitigation.
---
How much of a pain in the ass is dropping in and out of shadow form to cast fear ward and and desperate prayer? Is it a non-issue or does it basically obsolete the racials?
---
I had a 27" and it was too large for me, if you play fast or competitive games smaller screens are better so you don't have to move your eyes so much
---
But it also depends how far away from the screen you are
---
It’s not gonna be very good at launch. It’ll do the job once things settle down IMO
---
Any recommendations or tips for someone trying to MT as a NE Warrior in vanilla?
---
I tanked as a Paladin from B.C through Cata
---
That wasn't bug, that was feature! I raided on ally and i remember one chromagus kill when we got 2x shammy shoulders. There was a lot of rage over ventrillo.
---
Or level 3+ at the same time.
---
SWP is insta cast right? You could theoretically spam it until you proc blackout?
---
Is there an internal CD for the proc?
---
Don't look at Facebook if you don't want to see the same site over and over again.
---
It's a positive feedback loop. AKA circlejerk
---
Abolish disease breaks shadowform, so if you're human or nightelf stack up on [Jungle Remedy](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2633). Undead shadowpriests are almost unbeatable if you can't get rid of devouring plague.
---
AV trick: there's an explosive expert NPC that patrols near the first tower and does insane damage. Aggro him and MC. You can now 2 shot anyone that comes up the tower and solo cap it
---
Yes, but I believe OP is talking about instances when the ML disconnects before he has a chance to loot the boss.
---
Okay  if so many people going to pick skinning and just sell the mats there will be a high supply. Would it be a good idea to pick up leatherworking and buy all the mats for a ridiculous low price from the AH?  Who knows ;)
---
Teach me, oh wise master. Do I just google and install this?
---
Save the $150 and buy the 1080p monitor. Then upgrade to a 4K monitor when they come down in price in a few years. 1440p just isn't a big enough upgrade to warrant the extra $150.
---
bahahahha did that trick work in the beta?
---
You weren't around for Legion pvp templates huh?
---
It was never allowed and people 100% did get banned for it. I remember a huge ban wave where people were commenting on a website I wont name here. Any modification of such files is against the T&amp;C's.
---
The modern wow client takes advantage of the gpu,  the original cliant from 14 rears ago was more cpu.  I tested both and the modern one hardly gives my cpu a workout while the old one hogs it up greatly.
---
Have you played vanilla? If you tank zf, st or brd in my group with your 2h I'm out.
---
Merging lower population servers and launching new servers should be a non-issue in 2019.
---
Back in 2004-2006, one of their old servers = one world.  Spinning up new servers, taking them out of service, and transferring player data from one place to another was definitely a process that took time and effort.
---
Nowadays, cloud servers and virtual server tech is everywhere.  They might be running 5 or 10 virtual Classic servers on a single set of hardware for all we know.  The horsepower of modern hardware has increased by many orders of magnitude in the last 15 years.
---
I have absolutely no clue what Blizzard's server implementation looks like, but working under the assumption that they're leveraging the latest technology, combining low pop servers and launching new servers should be almost trivial for them now.  If it's not then I'd be very surprised.
---
Pretty much.  It's just an add-on for your browser that blocks ads.
---
You should also make a mouse over attack macro so you can send your pet on an add or the next mob without having to switch your current target. This allows you to ensure you don't lose any dps unnecessarily. I use T for pet attack, Y for pet follow, and shift T for mouse over pet attack. It's an absolute game changer, I promise you.
---
American vs British English. It's correctly spelled offence in British English and offense in American English.

Outside the US life in terms of PTO benefits is drastically better, don’t get me started on healthcare. 😔 
---
Contrast that with my prior employer, where asking for a day of sick leave was like a sin of satan. - they actively expected people to cancel vacations/time off because the firm acquired a new client and they needed the staff.
---
PoE and PoEII were far better from them (they are my favorite gaming company).  Tyranny wasn't bad though, just no where near the level of the others.  Honestly, I was literally just thinking about a playthrough of PoE again as I read your comment.  
---
Might fire up the old game machine and play tonight, you pushed me to it random internet person!
---
Then roll on a PvE server
---
The game is coming out the same week that classes start back up for me (summer release my ass), so I'll be lucky to ding 60 by December.
---
Nerd....
---
Wait a second... Why am I here as well...
---
Agreed. Everthing about that Wrath cinematic is incredible.  By hearing King Terenas' voice it reminds us of who Arthas was when we first met him. The music drives home the tragedy of his fall from grace. Shattering the glacier and beholding the legions of undead before him allows us to glimpse his power. The irony of everything being said there, especially "stirring the hearts and minds of your people". 
---
Original WoW cinematic is good, but WoTLK's tops it.
---
Ah I must have had that macrod as well then.  Either way it’s no big deal.  Tbh the classes that I used fear ward against (locks/other priests) I generally would stay out of shadow form anyway.  Normally because these fights lasted a long time anyway and you don’t benefit from the armor off of it and you have to be using loads of healing spells if you want to win, unless they are in trash gear and get 2 shot.
---
Yes that is true, but tailoring can also make a bunch of stuff that I can DE to help level up enchanting. But you're right, it doesn't make too much sense to level up a prof that you don't really need only to drop later.
---
I think you're right though. I'll likely go herb/enchant or skinning/enchant just for some extra income and drop it once I get my mount. I dunno... truth is I will probably decide once I'm level 5.
---
While its not vanilla.... I personally used the WotLK cinematic where they assault the Wrath Gates to get my older brother interested in classic. He doesn't know the difference and the machinima is excellent...the video leaves you wanting more
---
Shadows on low, and you should be good.
---
Oh shit its a disease? Never played priest but want to try it. Might do troll then but I figure if I'm fighting a paladin I can just mind control them to their death anyways (assuming they don't have a friend)
---
I switched to 1440p 144hz a couple years ago and it's the best thing I've ever done for gaming. To give you a better idea on your frame rate we would need to know your cpu but you should easily be pushing 100+ fps assuming you understand your build since you have a 2060. It 100% will make the game look much much better. If you don't mind spending the extra money, do it. You will not regret it.

Salv is arguably better. 30% higher threat cap vs the tank. WF increases tank threat, but also increases melee threat, and horde casters rarely get tranquil air.

Coupled with the RTX 2060 do you think this is good enough for 144hz on 1440p ultra settings?
---
Same here. It was the part about the CEO making it his last act to bring classic. Just emotional and respectful.
---
And? Humble bragging is bragging about what you *have* behind a veil of being humble. "It's not much but it's all I can afford" and it's a picture of a $4000 set up.
---
OP asked what monitor would be better because he's thinking about buying one and if the extra 150 bucks would be worth it.
---
Is it a humble brag to say my garbage bags aren't generic brand? Gimme a break.
---
Mouse over pet attack is incredibly clutch. You can pick up adds that pull, peel for your healers in group, and send your pet to the next target (or additional targets) without having to sacrifice any DPS doing so manually. I recommend mouse over pet attack all the time to people because it adds SO much to the class's toolkit and is a major quality of life enhancer.

Good idea, thanks! If you haven't seen it, I'd suggest watching this remastered version https://youtu.be/LwngFEIg8Kw

Really cool edit while still staying true to the original
---
Femme Fatale
---
Yeah, in really early dungeons you can tank as arms and heal as a non-healing spec, but then it gets difficult.
---
I tanked as both a Druid and a Warrior in 5-mans and I was able to pretty much gear up my blues to acceptable levels just by not inviting other leather or other plate wearers. I actually really loved grouping as a Fury Warrior/Arms Warrior, but it was so hard to quickly find a group in 5-mans that I just geared up as a tank and tried to avoid grouping with people that would compete with me on gear. I off-tanked raids too, but I always reveled in being able to DPS, it's just that I was sadly not wanted in that role. Fury Warriors, Feral Druids should expect this type unwantedness, it's harder for them to gear up.
---
I do miss Vanilla tanking, and I do kind of fear DPS may get boring, but I plan on leveling a DPS class, and maybe level an alt simultaneously when my main runs out of rested XP. My alt will probably be a healer or tank class, or maybe just a Druid so I can do whatever(except Moonkin, Moonkin sucks)
---
To be fair, while it is a handy tool for most things, Google should not be the gatekeeper for all knowledge.
---
It should, but I wouldn't expect to play it very well. Maybe 20-30 frames on low settings. Without a dedicated GPU you'll probably get a ton of frame spikes doing dungeons and raiding and such. I'd try to find something with a mobile GPU if you can
---
If you run it at the original Classic resolution with anti-aliasing turned off, you should get an acceptable 30-35fps.  40-mans might get choppy though.  Best of luck!
---
So excited to be wanted as a warrior tank
---
Any movie with Chuck Norris.
---
I say play what you enjoy, and that's it! I played Hunter 1-60 with no alt and plan on doing so again this time around, life on the road with my trusty pet is all I need!
---
Tldr, gtx 1060, i5-8300h, 8gb ram,  ssd. Can I play on ultra in 1080p with 60fps?
---
No cooldown, but from what I remember there are diminishing returns.  The first blackout is 3 seconds, the next 1.5, the last .75, then they are immune.  Does anyone know if classic is like that?
---
They’re solid dungeon tanks and are monsters in PvP
---
Yup, transmog is something I really hate. It's cool to see what gear people have just by looking at them.
---
Depending on your server and what alts you have, you can potentially log in, craft some stuff, work the auction house, and log back out.
---
12GB DDR3 RAM
---
AMD HD 6870
---
i3 322p
---
You act as if there aren't a significant number of guilds with well over 100+ players (and raiders) on their roster, both now and for the last 10 years
---
I mean, if they have enough of an emotional connection to it and its their house i dont see what the issue is?
---
And said online resources won't be viable on launch due to Classic not having a web API (can't load character data)
---
Omg Thats awesome. I wish they brought it back with the fake dented looking finish on the old models I loved that Look lol
---
Then why would you be sharding loot people need?  If they're needing bops they don't need then find a new group
---
So is this like Risk?
---
bfa uses multithreads and directx 12.  Classic runs on one thread and directx 11.
---
That looks absolutely awesome. Always wondered what wow looked like on an ultrawide. Now I might need to get one too.
---
Macro casting shadowform and PW:s to auto dismount before.
---
Macro heals to cancel shadowform.
---
I've given plenty of reasons for why Leads are an archaic concept outside of "they're fucking stupid"
---
I'm so scared... Not really tho #eleshamanmetasmokesmage
---
Not sure a 10 minute cd spell makes things less "repetitive", as the asker was asking.
---
Fir da herd
---
That's now how malware ads work and wowhead is one of the worst offender for shitty malware adds I've found any any 'legit' website. 
---
They honestly should be ashamed of themselves.
---
I hopped on all my BFA toons and liquidated their inventories for gold so I could buy a few wow tokens to use for the start of classic.
---
Platinum doesn't get enough love. His vanilla flavors and owlman series had me cracking up. He and Madseasonshow are the best.
---
I need the gold I could get from selling your bis boots
---
Finally a chance to speak with someone who operates one of these WoW database sites.
---
Just visited wowhead. That is way too much junk on the homepage.
---
A great site I try to use is  [https://classicdb.ch/](https://classicdb.ch/)  for it's sheer simplicity. Still, it is loaded with outdated comments from various expansions that look to have been copied from other data base.
---
Someone ought to make a one-stop database where you don't need to cross-reference other outdated and sloppy websites and have to guess which expansion they are referring to.
---
RIP Thottbot.
---
It’s a faction vs faction adventure game. Less strategic than Risk - it’s more like the actual MMO itself! Quest, level up, purchase spells, PvP, do dungeons, and kill the main boss (Kazzak, Nefarian, etc) 
---
All-in-all, pretty fun for what it’s worth. Always a good time sink back in the day when Tuesday rolled around and server maintenance was going on!
---
Loke, 
---
Ret paladin world pvp. He even had the unique purple pvp tabard.
---
You don't need to use practice locks, I think I bought maybe one as a novelty in vanilla but otherwise had max skill without it. The majority of my skillups were from the boat in the barrens.
---
If I’m an enchanter in a guild group or group of friends, sure.
---
Leveled my shaman all the way up to high 50s before realizing that we had totems. Didnt even do the totem quests.
---
Unfortunately youtube is blocked by my work.  But what about the "World of Roguecraft" videos?  I vaguely remember there were 3 of them.
---
I've seen mages spam WTS conjured food on paervers somewhat recently. Seemed scummy to me too.
---
I couldn't really get into retail so I don't know what the demands are for raids. I did however quest and run dungeons. I don't remember off the top of my head what my framerate was but I was always over at least 120 fps. The cpu you have is more than enough. Keep in mind when you go to 1440p, the deciding factor in almost all scenarios on frame rate is the gpu.
---
Your 2060 rates just below my Vega 64 but the difference should hardly be noticeable and the demands on the gpu will be much less in Classic vs BFA. I can't see any scenario where you would go under 100 fps and you could very easily average 144+. If worse case scenario you do hover around 100 fps I'm a firm believer that 1440p 100 fps is a much more enjoyable experience than 1080p 144+ fps. Once you start hitting 100-144 fps, it's really hard to tell the difference in the mmo genre.
---
I'm just a random internet stranger, so take it for what it's worth, get the 1440p monitor. It's great even outside of gaming. You will love it.
---
Personally, I would never use one button for attack/follow. I assume this works by either always doing the next in the sequence (i.e., attack first press, follow second press, attack third press, follow forth press...) or conditional logic (i.e., if target is not friendly, attack; if target is friendly or no target, follow). Correct me if I'm wrong. The reasons (scenarios) I wouldn't use this macro is:
---
If you are currently in combat and want to quickly target and attack a second mob, you have to first, change targets, and second, press the macro twice if sequence and once if conditional. If a sequence, your pet will stutter step because of the two commands back to back, which is a *very slight* loss in speed or damage. Also, I feel like there would be some fat-finger incidents where you don't know if you hit it once or twice or three times or what and will have to visually track your pet (who may be out of camera at that moment) to know which mode he's in (or, I guess, look at his current status on the bar, which can be a pain in the middle of craziness). If conditional, the attack command itself is not that bad, but pulling your pet back can be difficult if you're being attacked while trying to clear your target (you clear your target, mob hits you right before you press macro again, and pet attacks the mob attacking you instead of following). Another issue if using a sequence is if your pet gets stunned or knocked down, the key presses might not register correctly, and you'll again be left having to arbitrarily find out which "mode" he's in. 
---
All of this, for me, boils down to an unacceptable level of pet control. I wan't to know that if I press whichever of my pet macros that he will do the corresponding command without worry or having to double check any other factor. That said, you do you, and all the power to you if it works for you!
---
Also, if your macro isn't like either of the two scenarios above, sorry for misinterpreting, and also, what does it do?
---
Spriests can own in bgs.  They're very team oriented.  Better with premades where priest diversity shines.  Please remember you shouldn't always be in shadowform.   And like every competitive pvp player consumables are key.
---
Never said viable.... Also, wtf r u rambling about?
---
/pet

Going off of wikis like this one: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Head_of_Onyxia_(original)
---
If you have information pointing to another patch, we'd be happy to review.
---
8750H is a laptop processor, so I'm assuming you're running on one. I would advise you to go with the 1080p one.
---
Most laptop CPU/GPU don't run at full-blast due to heat and power issues. A desktop 2060 is a touch weak for 1440 (would need to selectively limit some graphic options), so any laptop variant will likely have even more performance issues. Based on (very) limited searching, a mobile 2060 performs at ~75% of a desktop one. I'd highly doubt you'd comfortably hold a good, stable framerate on 1440 because of this.
---
I healed a ton in vanilla and can attest, I loved having feral tanks. 
---
In 5 mans preferred it even over warriors because of their massive armor and health pool. As their healer, I could just use big heals and end up regenerating loads of mana in the long-term since you have lengthy time between casts and rarely ever go oom. In raids, they don’t have the damage mitigation to compete with warriors on some physical damage bosses, but they’re still generally good enough. Throughout your end-game content, you’ll be running lots of 5 mans for gear/gold anyways up through farming for naxxramas. If you go try-hard with optimizing tanking and resist gear, you can easily tank plenty of raid bosses.
---
As others have said, shield and defensive stance until 60, then switch to prot.
---
[FROST SHOCK!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5mD1n4v2JA)
---
I'll be saying the same thing hah. There are 5 2H weps in MC for warriors and I'm gonna get at least one of them damn it. I don't care which one I get initially as long as I get it quick! Earthshaker, Obsidian Edged Blade, Spinal Reaper, or Sulfuron Hammer ---&gt; Eye of rag for the rich dreamers.
---
I'm curious if they have a similar database, but checks out on  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Victory\_for\_the\_Alliance](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Victory_for_the_Alliance). As a note not all of the items on the website have Patch Notes, but clicking around for the factions/quests tends to have the patch/date added.
---
Here’s the things that will flag you in a pve server.
---
Healing someone that’s flagged
---
Attacking someone/npc that is ‘flagged’
---
Entering enemy capital
---
Leaving a bg 
---
Type /pvp
---
And unless you typed /pvp or if you are chilling in an enemy capital, you will be unflagged after 5 minutes
---
The Adventures if Setz and Plexx, for some real old school montage. Back in beta when Undead were actually Undead, and Mortal Strike had no cooldown.
---
Just level a druid. You can pretend to AoE farm, pretend to tank, pretend to be a caster, pretend to be a DPS, pretend to heal.
---
They got it all!
---
Eh, I agree more with /u/pirate-irl 's comment on the matter. Specifically the "overemphasis on healing charts leads to your healers making bad decisions to compete on charts" part.  If we're not wiping, there is little reason to suspect that there is a serious problem with the healers.
---
I know they changed the rules about the API back in WoD due to people using Exo Raid Tools (I think) to place permenant markers on the floor for people to stand on for one of the bosses.
---
The engine is 8.x. It's not just the textures and polygons alone that determine frame rate. It wasn't necessarily obvious.
---
But yeah, it can run on some pretty damn low end hardware. A post like this is probably overkill but it's obviously something some people were wondering about.
---
What is this, and where can i get it?
---
As I was downloading vanilla back in 2005 I had read somewhere how expensive your mounts were and how a lot of people didn't have the gold at 40 for their mount. Well I figured, like any responsible person would do, that I was going to save each gold I made so that I could afford it. Well once I got to my bank I spent way too long trying to figure out how I could deposit my gold so that I wouldn't spend it. I mean its a bank right? Why can't I deposit my gold?!
---
&gt;The real hardcore players have their own plans that they won't be sharing for all you cookie cutter players to steal lmao.  
---
Oh one of **those** kinds of players. Lol.
---
What if I told you that vanilla and BC-onward don't have the same requirements relevant to class leaders XD
---
I never thought about how the cities would actually sound if everyone was talking
---
Does anyone else think the JonTron video after Nostalrius went down had a lot of impact. I always remember that video as a moment where I felt the classic community far and wide were beginning to really organize and call for Blizzard to give us a game if they were going to continue to shut down servers.
---
Whenever we had an enchanter, we'd just have him greed everything. People rolled need if they needed, passed if they did not. Enchanter then disenchanted everything and passed them out at the end.

What?! Why not?! Free linen cloth!!

Solid content right here

Do you remember if you had a chance against hunters or how you fought them?  I guess the gap closers in engineering might help.
---
Fairly sure they started giving temp bans for model edits like this because some article got written about all the nude mods in wow

Fortnite.  It's the best pvp game on the market right now.
---
Also that.

\[NA Alliance PVP\] LF1M Warlock for 5 man dungeon leveling rush to 60.  Must be able to play 36 (possibly 24) hours first day then 16 on /8 off schedule after that until 60. We have the group and route 100% figured out already and need 1 more Lock to make it happen. You must have practiced the lvl 1-18 route and be ready to rush to 17-18 with the rest of the group to begin deadmines.  We all have the whole first week off and are a fun and experienced bunch to play with. Please PM me if you want more info on discord. @Alvanos#5706
---
Getting 60 with a max level crafting profession will be amazing early on. Especially if you get the timber maw rewards fast.
---
Nah man, there are always people to run an arm+cath with you, why bother making loot rules if you can have it all.
---
Alright, Shadowmeld is awesome but mostly irrelevant when the fighting begins, Fear Ward is handy sometimes but has a longish cd, Stoneform vs WotF kinda evens out. On the other hand, Shadowguard timing is crucial for maximizing dps in chaotic situations, and Touch of Weakness changes the way you fight melee classes vastly.
---
This is hilarious! Mainly because I can picture my own parents getting mad at me to come down for dinner and leave the game.
---
I typically suffer from button clutter--so I try to keep the binds I can access quickly for the most important abilities. Because of this, I like to turn dash off and pair it with my attack and follow macros. Optimal? Nah, but works well enough for my tastes.
---
Do you know how long it takes to conjure lvl 60 max food and water? To conjure stuff for someone you might not even know? And the 25 other people who want free stuff, too? Don't know about Pservers, but in classic it was totally realistic to spend half an hour conjuring stuff so that an endless army of unknown can have fun.
---
Charging gold is just self defense.
---
Mana burn costs a ton of mana as well, I find myself often in stalemates vs Spriest as a paladin both as holy/prot, deep ret, or holy/ret (21/0/30 DPS build) if they mana burn me too much since then they still don't have enough mana remaining to actually kill me.  I have t2.5 gear + some naxx offpieces though so it's not like I'm a 2.8k hp nubmuffin runnin around. 
---
I view it more as a defensive or group utility spell rather than strictly 1v1, but that's only from the opposite perspective I've never played spriest myself.  Curious to hear any feedback.
---
Roger that, I've got a few mages saved that had a ton of priest macros.
---
Just do what Blizzard did to all of us. 
---
Release Diablo 2, planting the seed for a persistent online rpg world. 
---
Release Warcraft 3, a pioneer 3D rts that set the stage for todays biggest genre: MoBA. Get everyone obsessed over the universe.
---
Announce WOW, Warcraft 3 meets D2. 
---
Watch OG cinematic.
---
But can it run Crisis?
---
In dungeons I filled the healer role but I still melee'd in between heals, so I didn't feel like a total healbot.
---
Yeah no time for a job in wow classic.
---
No thanks, keep that shit outta WoW. As others have said, Layering is purely to fix a problem, a very temporary problem.
---
**&lt;Crab Bucket&gt; EU - PVP - Alliance - DKP - WED &amp; SUN 1930-2230 CET**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **(RP)-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
*Note: If RP-PVP servers are not available on launch, we will play on the PVP server.*
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
Please join our discord "Crab Bucket" qN9ywMy or write Perpo#9044 for further information.
---
PServer. Just hit 60 on another char and don’t know what to do now since they’ll all be deleted soon. Just waiting for Classic....
---
Witcher 3 atm. But I've already completed Hollow knight and cave story.
---
Yeah, but they still have to see you and then react.   By then you probably finished the cast.
---
Grim dawn and terraria
---
I need a job I just graduated college. Might get a project management position if I nail this interview. I'm pretty sure this will force me to play the game slowly.
---
Level as Fury. It's a better leveling tree than Arms. You can tank just find as either Arms or Fury.
---
That man deserves no hate whatsoever. In fact he’s probably the only popular content creator that I would prefer to have on my server. His voice is like monotone molasses to my ears.
---
Haha you must be great at parties.
---
I have keybinds for pet attack (T), pet follow (Y), and mouse-over pet attack (shift+T). I can leave my pet on passive (or defensive if not doing content where it would matter) and have complete control over what he does and who he does it to. It was awkward at first to get used to using those keys in tandem with all the other stuff, but it upped my hunter game by a considerable amount. Now I can use my pet as an extension of my character, not just a useful sidekick that may or may not understand what you want it to do ;P.
---
It's nice to have one feral per raid, especially ally side, unfortunately horde druids don't benefit from wf totem
---
The official World of Warcraft: The Board Game! It’ll have to be BoardGameGeek or eBay at this point - it was made by Fantasy Flight Games in 2005 and their licensing with Warcraft products ended in 2011, so no new copies will be available.
---
&gt; Will this be a (mandatory) thing for alliance speedrunners come classic or are we safe from such autism?
---
If you're in a competitive speedrun guild then yes, you're going to want every single benefit possible. If you don't want to go to those levels for competitive speed running... then join a guild that doesn't speed run?
---
Hi and thanks for this functionality. I expect there are still quite a few unknowns such as the rewards of the warlock quest Trolls of a Feather, as well as quest rewards from quest hubs added late in vanilla such as the Deep Woodlands Cloak from the Horde Hinterlands quest hub. Does your team have any additional information on quest hubs and their rewards as far as phasing goes?
---
Also, while I have your attention: is it possible to purge the post-vanilla information from the Classic site? For example: I shouldn't see the 8.2 trailer on the main page, Old Hillsbrad shouldn't popup as a search result for Hillsbrad, and item results should not link to transmog guides.
---
I'm really sorry that life has treated you this poorly so far. If you were to start a conversation I'd gladly jump in and go back and forth with arguments. As you sadly missed the point and had to throw your low IQ around here I just figured a dialogue with you isn't productive.
---
why not go back to Nov 23, 2004?
---
PUBG's latest patch is quite good. And still playing CSGO/Battalion 1944. Getting back into Dirt Rally as well, my favorite racing sim.
---
Be a druid so you can be a furry and no one can judge you for it, cause that is a cultural thing
---
That's Ironic because everybody is going to die to 15 year old content at some point, even you big boy...
---
Stealing this
---
Its in the office with the pc so somewhat hidden. CDs where lying around gathering dust so figured would do something with them.  Mostly there to remember something that was part of my life.
---
I get your point, but Classicdb in particular is literally just a scrape of Wowhead from like 2010 and contains a lot of inaccuracies due to having post TBC changes to items. Additionally it seems kind of shady to use a site that's predicated on stealing content from another site. It'd be one thing if they'd just stolen the data, but they literally stole the design and code. It's pretty fucked up.
---
Thanks I appreciate that
---
It would be a mad house
---
If he's a serious speed running he wouldn't be worried about putting in the extra effort for additional buffs, I don't know why he just doesn't join a non-speed running guild if he doesn't want to do the shit like he described
---
I want to play priest but I played a warlock in vanilla and a hunter for 2 years on a pserver. The thought of not farming Maradoun chills me. I love pets. Such high utility. I can't imagine what it likes to tank everything myself, in cloth.
---
Mordhau. I highly recommend.
---
OK, uhh well what we’ll do, I’ll run in first, uh…gather up all the eggs. We can kinda just, ya know, blast them all down with AOE. Um, I will use Intimidating Shout to kinda scatter ’em, so we don’t have to fight a whole bunch of them at once
---
Well, yeah you can't waltz into a bg in full greens. However the hybrid spec isn't about dealing damage - it's basically a group PvP oriented healspec. 
---
You go 21 Shadow for lvl 1 swp spam, r1 mindflay for peel, 5 sec silence. Nova because it's just nuts in PvP, 1/3 blessed rec for rogues n shit. Imp mb because well, it's manaburn ツ.
---
OSRS, but god this game is boring
---
Only thing I could agree with you is the debuff cap. Fuck transmog
---
Missing kick on a warlock's fear when you're not playing undead is really annoying.
---
 [http://i.imgur.com/PxKWgdQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/PxKWgdQ.png) 
---
there is a difference in leeway when slowed and not slowed on beta. U cant use abilities like sinister strike, but autoattack and auto attack modifiers like heroic strike can be used.
---
You dont have leeway at all when using rp walk keybind or backpeddle because of this code. in vanilla until mid Wotlk u walked when slowed 30%+. After the change, running animation even when slowed 30+%, leeway changed with it because u were always running. so mid wotlk-current leeway works with abilities when slowed as well. (u can check through the warrior videos of klinda to see slowed animation change over time)
---
Im nearly 100% sure devs tested leeway in regards to both people moving and it being applied but i dont think they tested the slowed part. And any pve aoe grind guide or leveling vid from vanilla will disprove leeway on mobs. thats blantly wrong.
---
Most warriors level fury or arms and keep a decent one-hand and shield in their inventory to tank dungeons.
---
You don't need prot spec until 60 or near 60. Anyways dungeon xp has been confirmed to be REALLY good for leveling. People have compared it to that one world record vid and its comparable or faster.
---
This is something that baffles me. This stuff was all new about a decade and a half ago. If you go hardcore then you're necessarily doing the minimum, to get the maximum, as fast as possible because you want to beat out the other hardcore people for bragging rights on a 15 year old game... I guess??? I can't imagine all the fun stuff about leveling that you'd miss out on if you rush to 60 so you can be a spreadsheet min/max raider. It sounds like you're just going to get bored way before everyone else who really just want to recapture some of those "good old days" fun times.
---
I'll be clear: I don't have anything against those people because I expect they are going to be a minority and the "OMFG THIS IS UNFAIR I WANT XYZ CHANGES BECAUSE BLAH BLAH BLAH" stuff that we'd see from them in the forums is moot when you're looking at a "Classic" game because we by and large know what the future looks like if it's going to happen because it already happened once. You guys and gals do you.
---
When I did this the first time around I was happy to play a meme spec (Ret Paladin) who was in a serious raiding guild, but not a hardcore one. As my guild went that direction is when I lost interest and quit. With Classic I doubt I'll have enough time to dedicate to being a raider if I even make L60.
---
Did you write this?
---
Shadowmeld is not irrelevant because it gets you the jump which is the whole point I was making.  While defending LM for example and a mage comes to cap, which do you think will land the MC, a nelf or a human.  This is changing the fight completely 
---
Fear ward cd is less than a minute, that’s not even remotely long.  If you think that it’s cd makes it less impactful then why did you bring up DP?  
---
Im not saying horde racials aren’t good but saying alliance have no exciting racials for shadow is just silly!  A lot of pvp shadows are literally rolling alliance just for dwarf and nightelf racials.  One is damage based and the other is utility.
---
Yep,  did you like it?
---
Just level/tank as arms. If your end goal is to be the most efficient tank you can be (ie, level exclusively through dungeons) id go with a build like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVhxzhbZVZxi0o
---
You’ll absolutely suck solo, but it’d make you one tanky mother fucker for instances. (Start with arms, go into fury, then prot) Can’t stress enough that running this build is for dungeon spam with pugs only. If you’re leveling normally, go with a straight up arms -&gt; fury build. I have an AoE tanking variant I’m personally going to be running for dungeon spamming.
---
Jiggly is saying  Raid Leader gets passed on DC thus you can assign a different master looter even if it was RL
---
Keep in mind that FPS while in a random zone is something completely different from FPS you get in a 40 man raid encounter or in a major city. 
---
Btw, SSD should be obligatory.
---
Create a pet attack macro that switches your pet to defensive mode and a pet follow macro that switches your pet to passive mode. It'll save you a lot of busywork and embarrassment.
---
For sure. Mostly just speaking from my perspective as a long-time rogue player. It feels like 1/4 or the class, at best, that it was in vanilla when I got so attached to it.
---
Damn..... a lot of walmarts keep their employees under 40 hours so they dont get certain benefits, so if youre not even putting in 40 hours a week then in a month you get like 3 hours of PTO. After 6 months not even 3 days.
---
Druid main here. The biggest downfall for me is actually 2. Lack of burst damage and lack of a normal Rez. 
---
Druid PvP is TONS of fun, but sometimes you look at that hunter over there that’s sitting on top of a hill, pressing aimed shot multi shot and their target is dead, and realizing I would take 30-60 secs to kill that player. Sometimes I think “Maybe I’ll roll X for awesome PvP burst” then I remember how much more fun Druid is than the Mage I played which had the 1 shots
---
The other issue of Battle Rez, oh my goodness. It’s not even like groups don’t want me. I actually don’t want to be in the group without a Shaman or Priest since anyone who dies has to run back. It really sucks always needing a rezzer with you, especially if you’re healing there aren’t many Shaman / Priest DPS
---
Also good for keeping healers (and mages) in combat so they can't drink.
---
I've been doing private servers for a while, but stopped because it was starting to sully the experience, I felt. Now just plugging away at Skyrim and Fallout 3.
---
25 here, watched my cousins and brother play WoW when I couldn't. They told me for years how good it was until I played Wotlk on private servers when they had stopped already.
---
Now we're all going to play together. Also teared up.
---
My first main was a Paladin and I thought Consecrate healed and did damage, so every instance I would heal in I would constantly consecrate under everyone thinking I was healing them. Just going oom and wiping groups and blaming it on them. Until I got to 60 and went Ret like a real man.
---
Private server. Trying out a few new-to-me classes.

Hey, so the 8.2 trailer on the main page is actually part of an advertising unit - interspersing the ads with a WoW video clip is quite profitable, way more than static image ads. I don't know if we can ask the company that handles the video unit to have a different set of videos showing on the Classic site, but it's worth a shot. Just wanted to clarify that the purpose of that section of the site was an advertising unit, not Wowhead trying to give people a rundown on cinematics. I can see how it can be kind of weird to see BFA videos on Classic though.
---
Do you have an example of the item results linking to transmog? We've kept the sets as "Item appearances" because it helps power the Classic Dressing Room and allow players to select a matching set at once. But they shouldn't be called transmog on the Classic site.
---
As for things like Old Hillsbrad, Blizzard included all these zones in their Classic data, which is how they get picked up on Wowhead. I'll probably do a zone pass this week, to hide Blizzard's unused data from the site.
---
And yeah, Trolls of a Feather we categorized as P4 for now, but post-launch quest hub rewards are something it would be nice for Blizzard to clarify.
---
Let’s just ban this guy from the sub, don’t wanna have to re read something like that again.
---
I was joking because his talents look randomized.
---
We're covering 2 different topics, I've been talking about rotation activity from the perspective of, for example, a Human SPriest just spamming Mind Flay as the baseline. You've been talking about the overall fight. So I was just trying to say that Horde wins out in terms of "having more buttons to push" in combat.
---
Classic will only be running on a single CPU core.
---
Nah pretty good dps, just terrible mana   consumption
---
It's the core of the perceived issue with min maxers... I have no problem with min maxers.. The problem being with all the people influenced by said min maxers.. So people who choose min max logic when it gives them an excuse to shit on someone else, but they themselves are actually shit.
---
TLDR- MIN max if u want, but keep that gay shit to yourself
---
Shoutout to Taladril for being an outstanding admin and running the server for close to 3 years now

The worst game ever!

Only played once and never again.

The midgame PvP event was a crappy (my class was op) and the winning boss kill came down to whoever was closest to where the boss spawned.

Granted this was a long time ago, but it made my blood boil immediately seeing it.

Thank you very much Jerppaknight!  Yes, only 1-150 atm, I'll add that to the title in the future, sorry about that.  I'm planning on leveling a bunch of alts for professions so getting to level 10 (for skill level 150) is easier that 20 or 35 for skill levels 225 and 300.  I'll be making those once I finish these low level guides though.  Thank you again for the feedback :)
---
Gnome escape artist, also I know about the fear ward. Maybe just didn’t explain it well. Zerk rage is unfortunate but all classes have weaknesses against other classes.
---
Just letting you know that you’re taking about of your ass.
---
I dig you. Damn love it.
---
This needs more upvotes
---
Luckily (or unluckily) I\`m stuck working and reading for my final exam until the 23th.
---
But I guess I\`ll be playing some CSGO or DS until release.
---
I'm not one to hate on personal preference, but I could never use pads with a wristrest.
---
Something you've been using since the 90s im sure!
---
Used to be a pro league player who played with a trackball, and he was great.
---
It doesn't actually hurt the raid so much to gear off-specs now and then. Letting "optimal specs" having small upgrades after small upgrades is also a waste of gear.
---
In some guilds I know in retail vanilla, while some pieces are strictly off-limits (especially all gear that has +2% hit), some gear are not especially with a point-like system. Usually after the 3rd or 4th drop, all bids are open.
---
Haha it wasn’t a perfectly designed game, but my friends and I figured out some workarounds and it made for a fun afternoon.
---
Mass Dispel is the one that will dispel stringer shot like bubble etc. not sure if that was in vanilla tho
---
I think the cds are a nice touch tbf. Looks great btw.

The unfortunate thing is that the ad model of internet sites is dead/dying. Wowhead does offer a subscription model that removes ads if you really want to support them.
---
Rogues (PvP):
---
+ All the meaningful/utility parts of your kit have long cooldowns or a consumable cost, so you need to worry about both cooldowns and running out of reagents.
---
+ Are extremely easy to render impotent in 'classic' if you're not relying on consumables (no cloak of shadows, no shiv, no deadly throw). You pretty much need to be a junkie to be at the top of your game, with all the powder and performance enhancing liquids you'll be ingesting.
---
+ Druids will absolutely ruin your day with Faerie Fire (can't stealth, can't vanish), Thorns (you kill yourself on reflect damage) and Entangling Roots. The worst thing is all of this things last/hang around even if you kill the Druid.
---
Literally the first thing I posted.
---
where’d ya read that? It’s using the new client.
---
&gt;To add to this:  I have a bunch of different PCs around my place as well, and the oldest of them (a non-K Core i5 3rd Gen @ 3.2GHz) with a GTX 560 Ti video card ran the classic beta with all settings maxed out and 4xMSAA at 1080p without going below 60fps anywhere.
---
I have this exact GPU, GTX 560 Ti. Other specs are: 16 gig RAM, Intel i7-2600K @ 3.40GHz, Windows 10. 
---
I don't care about graphics at all. So no shadows, low model details etc is totally fine. I just want to be able to run the game in 1920x1080 with good fps. From your post it sounds like I should be able to do it? Even in a raid setting?
---
Warlock: raiding is shadowbolt spam; always the summoner, never the summoned
---
Rogue: good luck getting gear/groups you don't lead
---
hunter: arrow-weaving makes rewatching GoT during raids difficult; what are money and bag space?
---
druid: wtb burst, indoor cc, and the non-literal deaths of most /r/classicwow theorycrafters. Also *laughs at hunters idea of bag space*
---
I totally forgot you had to wait like 30 seconds to start dpsing, waiting for the tank to get as much aggro as possible
---
Yes, RX 460 already allows that while 1060 is big tier higher than that (and I tested that's on bigger resolution).
---
GS?
---
It really should. Especially when you think of how expressions such as "the elements" usually refer specifically to nature.
---
Would help both shamans and druids.
---
Not going to lie. That gave me a semi
---
She is not leaving....
---
I remember watching a stream from Kargoz. He was playing with one of the top Warlocks from the old vanilla days. That guy showed off how to get 3 succubus seductions off in a duel and win.
---
Except then you have the problem of people slacking, and/or just playing badly.   I am not saying they're the all be all, but the healing officer should be keeping track of people constantly underperforming.
---
I'm seeing a lot of people complaining about Melee Leeway and not so many people complaining about Spell Batching... IMO these two mechanics seem to balance each other out; am I the only one?
---
&gt;Doesn’t really make sense though - if claw and bite are both active - only one bite will go through  at the very start and then never again because claw will eat all the focus since it has no CD.
---
Well, with Bestial Discipline 2/2 you go to 30 focus per tick from 25 (not sure on the exact amount and can't find a source, so I would love to be corrected on this!) ; this would result in 35 focus every second tick from which a bite can be cast. 
---
And while without BM the extra bite adds up to the initial burst, I agree that skill points spent elsewhere would offer more benefit.
---
I have it (also including the BC and Shadow of War expansions like in your BBG image) and it's one of my biggest wastes of money. 
---
The leveling process and overall mechanics are nice, but you faction interaction is boring as fuck. There is way too much downtime between faction / player turns. 
---
I know there is a custom ruleset that is coop only, but since that caps your number of players at 3 we've never gotten around to play it.
---
I wanna be you so bad right now.
---
Not all laptops are equal, so YMMV. I'd recommend running some benchmarks and looking at the results. It's possible your system has better thermals than mine, so it may be less limited in that regard.
---
I would also advise looking up your particular model to ensure the HDMI/DP/etc output can actually use the dedicated GPU. I ran into this on another (non-gaming oriented) system that could only use the GPU on the laptop screen; anything external was controlled by the CPU's integrated graphics.
---
It's using a newer client pre DX12 implementation.
---
Yes. Loot tables were indeed changed in the pre-patch of December 2006.
---
Heroes of the Storm, Hearts of Iron IV and Witcher 3
---
reread the post, I said on /r/wow these things occur. I don't need to convince anyone of anything, I just made an observation on the quality of posts that are found on /r/wow and my hopes that we do not devolve into that and keep the sub moreso geared towards the game itself and its content.
---
Gear score
---
Which is what I said. We just *thought* it was a bug back then, but now I know it was an intended change by blizzard.
---
What does that mean? An achievement?
---
Some form of quickly sharing your gear and talents so you can be compared against others is absolutely going to be built for Classic WoW.

You forgot buffs, and resurrecting, I added them in to completely answer OP.

Is it optimized yet or should I continue to ignore it like it deserves
---
Man I was so excited that I had two days to start WoW before my semester started. I double checked the academic schedule and apparently I was going off of last years start date.  This year classes start the day classic WoW launches.. Oof.
---
It was in game since start. Oh, all shammy braces we disenchanted in mc around patch 1.6-1.9.
---
I mained a warrior. They are amazing, but leveling, they just don't have the utility of other classes I feel.
---
* Minimum or even fanless setup - AMD APU like Ryzen 3 2200G or 3200G. There are some prebuild PCs with those CPUs too. 8GB RAM (Ryzen likes good RAM) and a decent SATA SSD. 
---
* Mode 7 (high settings) on bigger resolutions and so forth  - RX470/570 or GTX 1060 3GB used or new with a heavy discount. Then you can check prices on used/clearance Vega 56/GTX 1070 - that becomes overkill but for other games will be quite good. Moving up it's just AAA-games at 1440p and more, not really needed for Classic
---
* If you are thinking about a new display I can recommend ultrawide ones - for WoW they are super cool.
---
Shockingly not everyone playing is going to be a minmaxing try hard.
---
I have a 24” 1080p 144hz 1ms monitor and It’s amazing. I have no complaints and I don’t have any desire to go bigger or increase to 1440p.  
---
The 144 hz and 1ms latency are more important for a good gaming experience. How often are you gonna be sitting with your face an inch away from the screen counting pixels. Classic wow doesn’t have updated textures or anything so just imagine playing an old game in HD. It doesn’t really gain any benefit.
---
Real life
---
Don’t get me wrong, it doesn’t have a ton of replay ability. And you’re right with the standard ruleset it’s not a whole lot to be proud of. But... those Warcraft minis, the huge map of Lorderon, the dungeon delves, picking up that sweet epic bow, the race to the main boss... it was everything my middle school mind needed at the time to get through server downtime!
---
People will be tryharding, there's no casual fun in 2019 gaming.
---
All of those bans were reversed.
---
Toying with the idea of rolling a druid and primarily playing resto or feral tank (if a spot is available) predominantly, but asking the raid leader if I can have some fun for a raid or two here and there after I've had time to also gather feral DPS pre raid BIS, and we have the current raiding tier on farm.  I don't think I'd be up for farming MCP's each and every week, but would sure like to do it occasionally just for a change of pace if nothing else. 
---
Or I may just roll Warrior or Mage and be a real boss... Decisions decisions...
---
15 years of private servers and everyone still hates GS in vanilla
---
FYI we started removing generic pictures of manuals, discs, boxart, etc a little bit back (Rule #7).
---
If this is the same Shaman Classic discord I'm in, it's practically unusable to discuss anything and looks to be unmoderated. God help you if you even mention anything that isn't Resto.
---
It's a measurement of gear level. An addon tallies up the item levels, enchats and in later versions gems and such, giving your loadout a score.  
---
Like a sign at an amusement park that says 'you must be this tall to get on the ride', except the number is generally hyperinflated as the later generation has become increasingly picky. The thought process is generally that if you increase the required gear level to an abnormal number, you will see less competition on the dropped items, a higher success rate and clearing speed because better gear means better performance.  
---
To each their own, but I personally stay away from groups with abnormal joining requirements, regardless of whether I meet them or not, as it's been my personal experience that these kinds of people tend to suck the fun out of the activity in one way or another.  
---
You do you, I'll do me :p
---
Onions
---
Ah, I suppose I'm not familiar enough with how discord is being utilized. 
---
Also, you said LFG and not specifically group finder, which was what I was thinking in my head.
---
D2 and FF8. Just bought the newest expansions for Grim Dawn and Kerbal Space Program though. Likely to swap over to these for the rest of the wait time.
---
I dont really competitively raid in retail anymore, but I still have so many bad hunter memories from when I did. Bringing out a taunt pet on Onyxia so it grabs aggro early on and turns her the wrong way is probably the highlight tho.
---
For me it's the Wrath cinematic, but the Vanilla one is a close 2nd :)
---
Well, that's not a very interesting outcome and is probably only likely if Classic completely bombs and is under 100k subs at 6 months in. I think if you have anywhere more than 100k subs you'd do *something* to keep them around, even if it's just one intern setting up a new fresh server every 8 months.
---
8.2 I like arenas.
---
The ole goalpost shift.
---
Video for those wondering [link](https://youtu.be/EzT8UzO1zGQ) 
---
I think it helped legitimize the claimed but I think the movement was really going ahead, a lot of people I cancelled their sub (me included) during this time and nothing gets a company moving faster than losing millions a month.
---
That's interesting, didn't know that
---
Afaik 5% int doesnt stack on gear. also you'll definitely be at a disadvantage when facing an undead warlock, he'll fear you. you wont be able to do the same to him or blow him up quickly enough. Locks are pretty good in world pvp but health pools will be too small at the beginning (b4 t2 gear becomes available) and that will force you to pvp with a voidwalker or die to any rogue 100% of the time as a non-undead lock. they'll just stunlock you and destroy you whilst being immune to fear/seduce otherwise.
---
You can do whatever you want ofc. I think I'm a pretty decent player and world pvping was still ok even as a human warlock just cuz of the insane amount of dps you can dish out. Still felt frustrating to lose to bad ud rogues/ud warlocks and being forced to pvp with a voidwalker. My 2c.
---
Oof, now that's a DKP -.
---
Naxx on pserver. At KT with 4 resets left.
---
Nothing wrong with having only a level 5 alt, maybe later on utilizing the resting experience to get it to 35 for a maxed profession. Since you can disenchant everything with no profession level requirements, there is little to no reason for me to focus too much on any other character. I'll be rolling a Priest and was looking into farming alts, and long story short, doesn't look like it's something worth doing, I rather spend that 150+ hours on farming with my Priest. I prefer the group farming methods instead of solo farming anyway, and I don't intend to play that much to effectively utilize the excess amount of gold.

Actually yeah, I've got to configure and order all the parts for a new pc, get it all shipped here, assemble it, get it up and running and get wow installed and patched. 
---
I should probably get to it.
---
I did actually. Bookmarked it for me to follow on release!
---
Never really had a problem with it. I was a vanilla &amp; tbc mage. I think my next char never got above 40 (warrior). 
---
In WotLK I rerolled DK and that was the first time that I pushed my mage to lvl 80 (since she already had herb at a decent level). Added mining to support my BS/JC DK. 
---
Never got my warrior above 50 I think.
---
You fine folks are doing God's work, keep it up!
---
dun goofed.
---
Glad to hear it Hermes :)
---
I personally like what they were going for with war mode. PvP realms weren't offering anything special except the promise of getting ganked by a max level while you were leveling. World PvP was long dead. 
---
If it worked like Blizzard wanted it to, it would have been able to bring back world pvp for the first time in a looooong time. BUT, sharding and a major lack of Alliance participation really muddled the execution. Even with Blizz heavily incentivizing Alliance, not many are opting in. Hard to have world pvp when one faction decides they don't want to participate.
---
In regards to class homogenization, yeah that's still a big issue. Ion has at least acknowledged they went way overboard and says they're working on bringing the unique-ness back to each class. I'd keep an eye on it to see how 9.0 is going to handle this. I want them to give you a reason to want to bring a class even if it's not the top DPS/heals/tank without creating a situation where it's necessary to a group to have one or else you're just kinda stuck.
---
I really, really disagree with your comment on class specs feeling the same. I feel like right now, you play a spec rather than a class. Ass rogue is completely different from outlaw which is completely different from sub. Same for basically every class. Specs are more fleshed out than ever, really. Each spec has very little overlap with each other, and they usually have very different styles for doing their role. 
---
What's lacking is a more cohesive feeling of belonging to the class, rather than the spec. You used to have access to pretty much the entire toolkit of the class no matter your spec, with your spec basically just carving out a niche for how you used those tools. 
---
I think there's a good middleground there where a class can always have certain abilities that are the core idea of "this is what this class does" but also have switching specs be more defining than just "well, guess I don't use that ability anymore"
---
You cast /seduce

*HOT GIRL HAS FLED THE BATTLEFIELD*
---
oh man that's gold. So you're here pre-emptively complaining about softcore porn. That's fantastic, holy crap.
---
Would be a decent Classic+ era idea, I guess.  Not a huge fan of it myself.  Your nomenclature is abysmal though... your use of the word ‘layer’ has no relation to what layering actually is or how it works.  This point alone is probably going to get you downvoted into oblivion.
---
Layer as it’s actually going to exist in Classic will be removed by the end of Phase 1.  So this talk of the Seasonal layer being merged with the main layer after Kel’Thuzad dies doesn’t make much sense and is going to trigger a lot of the anti-layering crowd.
---
It rewards raw technical skill, strategy, tactics, spacial awareness, game sense/enemy tracking, and it allows for basically limitless mindgames.
---
Tbh the only people who don't recognize fortnites god tier gameplay are people who have never played it or people who played it and sucked.
---
I forgot /s
---
Item level is the average of the official item levels on gear, gear score combined all the individual scores of your pieces in to one giant number, not the average :p
---
It takes your total intellect amount and then adds the buff. So if you are running epic it does get a good boost to crit chance and mana pool. No I hear you. I’m just saying with the right planing and pots you can dominate just about anyone. I have 9 macros already, class guide, tons of research. And 13 days off work lol. I’m not going in half cocked. But I appreciate any more insight you have.
---
I would only recommend leveling as prot if you plan on almost exclusively leveling via dungeons, I have 6 friends I'm playing with so we will be dungeon leveling since we should almost always have a 5 man team, so I'll be leveling prot, but from my private server experience prot warrior solo leveling is very slow
---
If you have 3 blackout proc in a fight, you gonna win that fight
---
All /script macros will not work, well not all.. but the ones typically used on private servers that have multiple functions and the "else if" statements. This is to prevent gameplay automation, which is something Blizzard is against and such "features" haven't been seen since TBC launched. You can find a direct Blizzard quote about it from Blizzcon 2018 Classic panel here: https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2496
---
If you want a single keybind function, you will have to resort to shift/ctrl/alt modifiers such as;
---
    /petattack [nomod]
---
    /petpassive [mod:shift]
---
I prefer the Norm MacDonald approach.
---
"Interviews". He did that once you retard. I know Esfand hasn't been streaming for a couple days so you're probably itching to suck his dick again, but please, try not to make it so obvious.
---
Even outside Discord, several Group Finder / LFG addons have already been made for Classic. Once one of them reaches critical mass, it'll become the de facto way of finding a group and be a must-have addon.
---
What? Bite can just be cast on auto cast, just like claw (always have claw on auto cast), but only when you have enough focus. Its a bit more of a hassle, true, but its increased DPS , a field our class is lacking in quite a bit, especially in those later raids.
---
I need your address for reasons totally unrelated to robbery.
---
Warcraft: Orcs and Humans
---
There were no raids in beta but it handled large outdoor events just fine, with many players.
---
Your system will easily handle classic even if you crank up those settings.
---
I can understand where you're coming from, but as an avid MMORPG player the one thing that bugs be throughout all games is when I spend countless hours/weeks gathering a set of gear that matches only to wear the complete set for a week before I progress into new content and get gear that replaces it and then I'm standing around for weeks in an epic armor set with the shoulder or helm or gloves missing and replaced with something slightly better but not matching at all.
---
It really ruins immersion and the cool factor of well designed armor sets.
---
No they 100% do ban for this and recently sent a massive wave out not even a year ago that hit a shit ton of rpers who were modifying their files to make their armor more detailed.
---
I can't wait to getting to know players on my server. Adding them to my friends and play with them.
---
Mage - drinking every other pull
---
Warrior - Im not a paladin and can't heal myself
---
Priest - Im not a paladin and cant bubble myself when a rogue is attacking me
---
Druid - only one rez and then your running back 
---
Hunter - dead zone, ammo, -1 bag
---
Warlock - not sure but as a priest it annoys the hell out of me when they use me as a mana battery when we have a mage in group.
---
Rogue - Didnt play much in vanilla but the good ones really piss you off unless they are on your team.
---
Pally - cant think of anything right now other than pigeonholed into holy spec in raids.
---
I got a 9700k and 2 2080ti in nvlink just for classic. Can't wait!
---
APEX APEX APEX
---
Glad to hear someone else loved it! My friends and I would play for hours.
---
OLDSCHOOL RUNESCAPE
---
 I am currently playing through it. If you have the free time to beat it, I would highly recommend!
---
&gt; Oh shit its a disease? Never played priest but want to try it.
---
It's indeed a disease. Meaning in theory anyone can cleanse it with a Jungle Remedy (and baseline any Dwarf, Paladin, Shaman and Priest can). It's a very mana inefficient spell, as well, so against competent/prepared players it's often not going to be a great choice. 
---
Of course against the plethora of people that won't have Jungle Remedies with them, and aren't playing a class that can remove it, it'll shred them. But I still think there's a lot more value and consistency behind Shadowguard (WOTLK is really the main argument for Forsaken, I think Troll's absolutely an underrated pick and my preference for SPriest). Hex of Weakness is also somewhat better and counts as a curse so tends to get a little more value (especially vs classes with healing).
---
I was extremely lucky and i feel like it was a total honor to have raided world top 10 in vanilla and bc as a ret paladin. Did i ret every single fight no i did heal or tank or dps just on the fly would respec but i had a blast and will never forget. I'd say i at least spent 5k in vanilla on respecs
---
Thank you for this. I'll take a look later tonight.

The only thing running through my head is the quest in Oblivion where the group of all female swindlers steal that guy's ring and you have to get it back. Cannot for the life of me remember the name.
---
Great, thanks for taking the time to answer.
---
thanks for the kind words!
---
Which is likely I'm afraid.
---
This is cool as shit
---
No, that entire ban wave was reversed and they haven't made any bans since. The current method of doing this is using Lucid Morph and not a single person has reported a ban or warning with it even though the devs know it was detected by Warden before release.
---
Silithus will only be filled with elite bugs at launch. All that other stuff gets added in phase 5.

Jesus Christ the guy was saying that race doesn’t make you a better person and you are going off on white people on a tangent.  You are actually a racist piece of shit my dude.  Also, just so you know, what you’re saying isn’t just racist it’s wrong.  Acting like white people are all ignorant of racism is honestly the dumbest thing I’ve heard today lol.
---
Altoholics were exceptionally rare in vanilla what are you talking about lol
---
If they have distance where they can OOC and eat, you want a full rank so that they cannot outheal the SWP with food.  I was watching duels a month ago or so and the mage couldn't outheal SWP while eating, which prevented the mage from resetting with poly.
---
You really made a video of Tips’ video where he discusses it in order to milk it for your own content? Pretty low effort
---
If I remember correctly, Joana set the Solo world record with about 128 hours (correct me if I'm wrong). But given that he did it without the mob of players and maybe other issues it will be less than likely anyone hits 60 in under 100 hours, even with insane strats. My guess is nobody will crack the solo record and some groups might get it or close to it.
---
I'll start this out by saying I played at release and was one of the very, very few deep talent fire mages in my guild. We had cleared MC/Ony/BWL/AQ20 before BC came out, so I had really nice gear. I think when BC arrived, I didn't swap out some of my stuff until I was closer to level 70 (I had a lot of Netherwind if I remember correctly).
---
I didn't have too many resists in MC/BWL as a fire mage and I still managed good DPS since my build would crit quite often. I shined in AQ though. I mostly chose this build for dungeons and pvp since we raided 4 times per week, and I was helping to farm between raids. Helping lower level guild members get geared up was also a priority.
---
My build from what I can remembers: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#o0xVZEgG0fchx0h
---
I would usually open with Fireball, and then move immediately to Scorch. In between casts, I would weave in my Fire Blasts as it came off cooldown.
---
Scorch was such a quick spell that I'd often get a few procs of Impact and Ignite. If I got a Clearcast, I'd move back to Fireball, then back to my Scorch and Fire Blast rotation.
---
The Scorch vulnerability also helped a ton to soften my targets, and since I was critting a lot, the refunded mana helped to keep my damage high.
---
HTH

Ok man thanks. I just took your advice and tried checking my model to see if it can use the dedicated GPU for video output but I couldn’t seem to find any results?

That sounds like a clever use of game mechanics.. Then throw them into the lava on the way to Molten Core for good measure.

we do not have a SimulationCraft but we do have the updated bloodmoon spread sheet  
---
with phase2 BIS, rank 9 evis, typical raid buffs and consumes (no word buffs), fight duration set to 3mins, 1x/31/5
---
0 murder 0 ruthless dps is 623.73
---
murder would provide a flat 2% @ +12.48dps
---
5p eviscerate rank IX in p2 BIS hits for 1052.87, crit chance is 35%. average factoring crits is 1421.37. a single evis over the 3 minute fight would add 7.89dps
---
RE Adrenaline rush: True, none of this is factoring in AR, but AR cant be perfectly slotted into a rotation roadmap as you wait for crusader procs (assuming fight is not long enough to use a 2nd AR)
---
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*but hold on a second, where are you getting your 3rd point in ruthless from? going 3/5 lethality? dps then drops to 619.33
---
you could be doing 2/3 imp SnD or 0/1 relentless, but then youd have to redo your whole timeline. 
---
maybe youre going 16/31/4? dps drops to 616.91
---
And they usually do, I almost never have the requured GS in wotlk, just ask and people often take you.
---
I've always wished I was like this, but I get bored and roll alts way too easy.
---
Yes it does. Hex is mini mortal for a reason 20% of a heal is usually 100-200 points and  with Shadowguard they are mostly a heavy mana sink if you spam them. And DP has more chance to prove blackout than Shadowguard and also does more damage
---
&gt;which was \~200ms, not \~400ms
---
Sauce pls?
---
Beware using AoE if there is a stealthed rogue or druid around. If they take damage that will flag you (and is not an entirely rare trick). Also be careful of hunters naming their pet the same name as random animals in the area (e.g. "boar") and using eyes of the beast to control it. They trick you into attacking their pet so you get flagged. 
---
These won't happen too frequently but I've seen filthy alliance try both.
---
That’s fair I suppose. Credited both videos and tagged his channel tho; definitely will take that criticism into account when creating future content! Thank you 🙏🏼
---
Just helping a stranger troubleshoot/understand why their game browser doesn’t appear as expected. No need to be rude.
---
Not really worth. You want spell hit and silence over blackout
---
If they pay more and the scam is obvious to everyone on the page I'm happy for wowhead. I have never given them any money and I didn't plan on doing so. If I have to deactivate AdBlock for them to make enough I'll happyly do that. I won't click on any ad anyways.
---
total war warhammer 2 a lot.
---
Mace “on hit” stuns procs from weapons don’t DR with Rogue stuns, but I’m not sure about this weapon and warriors.
---
Can you really feel such a difference not having 2% crit?  “Crit a lot less” is a little bit of an exaggeration, don’t you think?
---
If you want to grind out an AR, all the power to you, you’ll just have a lot of competition.
---
you're right it's total int. Still, you need 59 or 60 int to get a 1% crit point. Which means that even when you're full decked in t2 gear, you'll get like 0.4% more crit max. and the 5% more mana doesnt mean much since you'll just be life tapping all the time. Escape artist is pretty good for every class. But that int racial thingy isnt that meaningful. If you're set on rolling ally I guess I wont be able to convince you otherwise. best  of luck. It's pretty easy to get your pre raid bis as a lock and leveling is pretty easy too. 2nd best leveler in the game imo after hunters. Rotation is just dumb, curse of shadow and spam sb, or curse of doom..it depends on the assignments you get in raid. Best spec until late bwl is md/ruin, 0/30/21. Pretty boring, still the best for dps.
---
Dont buy all the tomes for the pets while leveling, and dont even bother to do all the quests to get them if you want to be efficient. You'll only be using voidwalker until 60 anyway. Unless they nerf it the best way to farm gold as a lock at lvl 60 is to do solo princess runs in maraudon. you dont need op gear to do that, can be done in pre raid bis...(even tho it's much easier and safer as a hunter). Only drops you care about in MC (if they dont introduce the updated loot table immediately) are azuresong mageblade and talisman of ephemeral power, so aim to get one of those asap (they are kinda rare and should be your prio). Everything else is pretty much garbage, especially the tier1 set, which is only decent for pvp because of big stam but it will drop like crazy and all the warlocks will be full set in like 2 months max.
---
Read that whole post you just linked.  And tell me they won’t ban for it.  Also there was a program called tmorph back in wod that people also got banned for frequently.  Including some streamers.
---
"Great for Warriors and Feral Druids! These instantly give 20-40 rage to the player"

Pretty sure you can't drink potions in forms.

I've had this thought since May and have even played some retail to catchup and unlock flying since then and I still can't bring myself to farm for gold...

Hopefully that means I won't have to upgrade my toaster then. It just has a Radeon HD in it. I think 5700.

It’s also typically not going to be well received that on a brand new account your first post is a self promotion of a video for your channel. Makes it look like you’re just trying to get follows, not actually interact with the community.

And "you might get banned for this".

There have been NO bans for Lucid Morph to date.

I was gonna say 24" are usually cheaper than 27", but that's a good point as well.

It comes with a hidden skill upon taming. If you reset his skills that skill is lost forever.

Thanks for the advice! I’ve been a lurker in the community for quite some time and have recently made a reddit account to interact more. What do you suggest are some good ways of getting involved more organically?

Entirely a private server thing. Some of them turned it off while others kept the way it works on live.

Do whatever spec you want. Just don't waste money on respecs.
---
Kiting is important, if nothing else that you can't really complete the Petrified Leaf quest without it... unless you ask another hunter to do it for you.
---
Might be a good motivation to say you can't roll/bid/etc on it until you can kite. I completed the quest in 4 or 5 days on and off whilst it took hunters who had won the leaf before me considerably longer because they never learnt how to kite.

I haven't started WoW on this screen yet, I'm waiting for classic! :D

It's more like spamming BRD/Strat/Scholo for gear, getting attuned then going for raids. Didn't look into the dungeon sets since this seems to be easiest to get raid ready unless you are really lucky with BoE drops.
---
May I ask, do you intend to roll Hunter again? If so, same Faction + Race? Either way, let me know. I am deciding between warrior/rogue/hunter and hearing your take as someone who raided back then will be much appreciated. 
---
Cheers!
---
So if a rogue leeway you from africa and in the same time, can vanish everything you throw at him (coils for example) this will balance each other out? I could agree if the message is that warriors have a kinda downside with spellbatching bc you can sheep charges for example but in my opinion it helps rogues even more so they benefit from both, leeway and spell batching

Evert PS with the nost core has it, and nost had it. Please stop.

Vanilla was first MMO experience for most of players, and we are talking about latest state of Vanilla.  
---
And this state did not last long enough. In fact, very few players knew the game quite well. Why did you even mention the experience before Vanilla? Okay, so now they have even more experience.
---
Well, if you want to fool yourself or waste some time, you can compare quality of guides and tutorials with someone, who is interested in it. I'm not.
---
Many of them are the same people. Are you asking how someone can outclass himself after years of training or what? You play and become better.
---
&gt;do you Think private server players are trying to ruin the experience ?
---
No. I do think they're trying to recreate their Pserver experience though, which may or may not be reflective of vanilla WoW.  
---
However I am inclined to think not.
---
That you ed?
---
Agree with everything you said, but Wrath's trailer has one huge downside vs Vanilla's: it doesn't include the player in the narrative.
---
Vanilla's trailer sets the stage for the world, then showcases the kinds of heroes (like you!) who reside in it. It communicates "look at the possibilities" and "adventure awaits you" in a very visceral way.
---
Wrath's trailer moves the player out of an active role and into a passive one. Watch the narrative unfold before you. You aren't really part of it. It's a symptom of the way the game's design had begun to diverge away from its roots.
---
So, although Wrath's cinematic on a technical level is beautiful and brilliant and all the things you said it is, Vanilla's cinematic does a much better job of pulling the player into the world and making them a part of it. And for that reason, it is the better overall cinematic in my opinion.
---
People still do that lol!

Write me a guide when you beat it please.

**US, PvP, Alliance, Semi-Hardcore, PST, Morning raid times**
---
**Main:** Human / Warrior / Fury (Open to gearing up in order to function as an OT)
---
Planning on no-lifeing for the first 1.5-2 weeks with family members who are also playing. The plan is to be 60, attuned, and farming BIS in that first 2 weeks.
---
Will probably play 20-30hours/week easy.
---
I want to focus on clearing content. No aspirations for world first or anything like that, just want consistent focus on progression and having fun with like minded people.
---
My current work schedule(2nd shift with possible extra time added to the end of shift) requires me to raid mornings in order to guarantee raid attendance. Anything from 4am-11am should work fine for me.
---
Would prefer EPGP + loot council for transparency. This worked for my guild back in TBC--but I am open to other options if they are better.
---
**Background**
---
Played Vanilla in 2005 as a rogue. Raided in TBC on the same rogue and a druid (heals then tank). Nothing special, but I am familiar with the game and with a few of the classes. I will be progressing much more quickly this time around. I played up until Wrath and was done when the game began going in a direction I did not care for. Looking forward to going back to Classic times. I am also looking forward to trying something new class-wise (Warrior).

I'll dig it out and do a post later tonight. I'll try and find out what, if anything, is different and highlight that.

Get involved in the sub discussions, build a presence on the discord, make connections in the community. Most subs I see don’t allow for more than 10% of your posts to be self promotion, so right now you’re at 100%.

Or use what the developers say is correct, not infer something from code posted in a pic by some guy? Do we know how he got that source code yet?

Awesome, thank you for your answer :)

Keep using it if you want just know your history.  There’s a reason tmorph isn’t around anymore.
---
Until we have actual logs from Classic raids, any claim of accuracy at this level of theorycrafting is useless.
---
I’m willing to admit that my assertions are based off my perspective specifically as a Warrior. I think there is a case to be made that Rogues have a potentially game breaking advantage tho. I will need to see how it feels over time I think to judge it more accurately.
---
The no talking thing gets me because I'm a chatterbox.

It's not really saddening, Vanilla WoW was always this way, if a valuable item drops you need because almost everyone else is. If you have a heart you can give it to the person who can use it right now.

Nope, they're cow men.

Good luck my dude/dudette!

Yea everyone totally wants to live around orcs instead of humans or elves.

I agree, no need to be rude.

Come on blizzard I know you want me to resub sooner rather than later.  I gotta test some addons.
---
You use Dungeon Finder, get a group. "Summon me pl0x" do the dungeon. Leave group. Rinse and repeat. Never really caring to remember who was in your group.
---
That is what many want to not have. Since it detaches any real social interaction or any group building it makes the game turn into a daily chore. Matchmaking removes too much of the social aspect many loved.
---
Final Fantasy XIV. Great game, great story. I've been enjoying it as a single player RPG. Sub runs out right around Classic launch so that worked out pretty well.
---
Thanks for giving me some really clear information here. I really truly do appreciate it. I was unaware of the discord server as well; is it reddit specific?? Would you possibly be able to post a link to it for me?
---
You dont feel that later on, because then you have a buttload of gear feeding your hunger for crit *and* hit.
---
But early on you often have to decide: "Do I want 1% crit or 1%hit?" You would die for Painweaver Band, however you know you need that 5% hit to not miss crucial game changing mortal strikes on the enemy FC. Therefore you pick Blackstone Ring over Painweaver Band and you now have 1% less crit. And this shit adds up. Omokks Girth Restrainer or Brigam Girdle? Blackhand Breadth or trinket + HoJ?
---
It's not 2%, but 5% from the axe specialization 5/5 giving 5% crit.
---
So all in all you later may have 30% crit chance and 5% isn't relatively as impactful as when you have to decide between 15% and 20% crit chance.
---
This is the same reason why lowbie warriors go for +agi first and foremost nowadays. Your damage is just so much better when you crit due to all these talents feeding your crits all while your sustained non-crit damage is not too impressive.
---
That's because elves are just inbred trolls.
---
*facepalm* you're totally right Nokrai

What are some good gear for a prot paladin pre raid bis? Im thinking about getting deathbone, blue pvp gear and just any plate gear with spell dmg.

Eating "bad" food and being fat is apparently bad for you while being slim, muscular and eating "well" is good for you. I'm still [suspicious](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/ANbD1CCdA3iI8/giphy.gif), but I'm getting in shape, eating "better" and getting into a gym routine/habit so I don't become a blob and die of a heart attack during classic.
---
&gt; I’m telling you they have and will ban for model changing.
---
No they haven't and you don't know that.
---
The reason TMorph isn't around anymore is because the developer took a contract at Blizzard.

You have no fucking idea what you're talking about.

We have people on both coasts so likely raid will land somewhere between 5:30PST/7:30CST/8:30EST on Sunday, Tuesday, or Thursday (TBD there is a vote going on). Most folks have had quite a bit of vanilla experience so I am not too concerned about our ability to at least clear content (not cutting edge of course, but hey we will see it). What are your days/times preference looking like?
---
But when you have bestial discipline you get 30 focus per tick, right? So after the first tick, claw goes off leaving you with 5 focus. Then when your next focus tick happens you should have 35, or am I missing something?

Metal gear solid 5

Random question. If you have a 2 hander with a very slow swing, and you get a timer, is there anything to stop you from using rank 1 crusader right up until the hit, then switching to rank 1 command? So like, if you do it right can you get the 40% haste, AND still hit with a different seal active.
---
Do it! I’ll be on the lookout.

There is a greed button for a reason.

I also wanted to point out that you linked to wowhead.com, vs classic.wowhead.com. If you browse items on wowhead.com, you won't see their Classic stats or guides, you'll see a bunch of modern guides and comments. 
---
You'll need to go to classic.wowhead.com (which doesn't have things like Today in WoW or live news), and if you visit the Classic version of an item page, you won't see comments from BFA or guides, but it will have the correct stats. We've also gone with an older look for the Classic version of the site.
---
Not sure if you were browsing that or not, but as you linked the BFA version of the site instead of Classic, I wanted to clarify.
---
Keep using it then and ignore all the ban wave posts I linked you I honestly don’t give a shit.  Honestly I hope you are one who uses it.
---
I play on a BC private server and gearscore is alive and well, and it will be in classic too.

It's just a shorthand way of seeing where someone is on their journey.

like if they're 1.7k or so they are a fresh 70. If they're 2.2k they've been doing heroics for a bit. If they're 2.5k they've got some badge gear and have prolly been to kara.

---
Huntzor,
---
Iv'e been contemplating that exact question for a while now. It's hard not to roll same class and race as I did back in 00's. But being older I want to try out a harder more demanding class, no offense to any other Hunter player. Warrior has a tough road to level but worth it once you hit 60. Rouge's did piss me off back in the day  but fun as hell to play especially in PvP and world PvP.
---
I've been experimenting with a Priest and so far I love it, that might be the class I roll when Classic comes out, but who know's. I had a love affair with my Dwarf Hunter. 
---
If you want a class that is the least stressful out of the three I would go Hunter.
---
Hope that helps,
---
Cheers,

You can multibox on two different subscribed WoW accounts under the same Battle.NET account and it will be no different than multiboxing on two separate Battle.NET accounts, but I wouldn't advise it. Even if you think you'll never do anything to warrant a suspension or a ban, you're protecting yourself by putting them on separate Battle.NET accounts.

It’s not a white people tangent so much as “people who say race doesn’t matter are patronizing fools” tangent.  I just see it coming more out of white people, usually right before or after they say something racist.

No. You get Spirit Tap first, then Wand Spec. After that you spend point into Shadow. When you reach level 40 you respec and get Shadow form, the next 5 point you earn will be used to get the Wand Spec back.
---
Yeah but what was nice is that if you had 1 low level piece or something you'd usually still be allowed in. With Gearscore 1 low level piece you cant seem to replace could drop your score quite a bit and exclude you from raids. It was just annoying and usually led to toxicity

My guess is they will make it around the name reservation period. I firmly believe this will get them more testers as many people will be resubbing to the game for the name reservation (which will also get them the first few weeks of classic launch too).

Not just warriors my man. Warriors love agility, so they share a lot of loot (even leather stuff) with rogues.

Weapons, trinkets, rings, necks, back, etc etc are all shared among the 5-6 dps warriors and the 6+ rogues.

I like how just enjoying a game is enough to get you neckbeards riled up.  B-b-but kids like that game! Kids like wow too you virgins except fortnite is actually high skillcap.

Great game and awesome OST.
---
Oh, it looks like I have a slightly different game. I have the World of Warcraft Adventure Game. But yeah. I'll post tonight or tomorrow.
---
no problem, could you please answer the spec question though? where are you getting your 3rd point for ruthlessness to have the 60% proc
---
I’m with this person. Please tell us what this lunch consists of.
---
It is. Its the 30min wait and 15min trip to the instance that makes it an investment. So people are less likely to trololol and quit after one mistake. Its worth it
---
I don’t think focus regenerates in 2 second increments like rogue energy does. I think it refreshes every second iirc.
---
honestly, be careful what you wish for. remember the site that used to track your raid readiness based off your armory? a vanilla gearscore is doable.
---
Yes they will, dont worry.
---
Besides how are they keeping aggro without Revenge?
---
Its insane how time consuming WoW can really be. There is so much to do.
---
Ah yes, that is a different game! Haven’t played that one.
---
I see you’re a man of taste
---
Using 2 separate accounts protects against bans and whatnot. Some guy could really piss you off when your already having a bad day and you could just snap and go off on him.  Having a 24-72 hour ban won't help much.
---
You could have 5 subs under one account and have 5 logged in at the same time. It was put in more for families so they can have control over the accounts from one place.
---
Comment threads about singular bans and speculations of a banwave are irrelevant.
---
I had been using TMorph since Vanilla and only ever stopped playing during Cata. Now I use Lucid Morph. Both discord servers are very good at reporting bans. There hasn't been a single banwave for either program that stuck.
---

---
Yep.

r/outside decent mmo but the grind is slow

Apex and Divinity 2
---
Thanks for the reply. I created a Nelf Hunter back in TBC and loved it. Like you I have the same struggle.
---
Similar contemplations here; Warrior/Rogue/Hunter with Priest as the wildcard. My friends want to go Alliance, and I think that is what muddies up my decision; race+class combos are easier decisions (for me) as Horde, since I don’t like gnomes. 
---
My friends are rolling Nelf Hunter, Human/Dwarf Pally, and human/gnome mage.
---
So for warrior, I can’t stomach the gnome but we will be pvping... For rogue, I could go dwarf and champion the stoneform but I worry I’ll have a love/hate relationship with the dwarf (did it ever bug you?). For Hunter, Nelf is a great choice and so is Dwarf.
---
Such hard decisions, and the speculation/etc is fun. But I know that come classic, I will have a blast with whatever choice I make, because this game rocks.
---
Unless the content is on farm and 40 randos from the guild could get it done first try.
---
This question gets asked at least once a day. Use the search function.
---
Jungle Love.
---
Seal Fate becomes viable a lot sooner than that. The general consensus on the threshold is 30% crit and in Phase 2 gear, you have  more than that.
---
I can redo the timeline in a bit, I want to make improvements to it in any case.
---
You won’t have to do that in Classic.
---
Nah bruv we donr ever die to avoidable mechanics.  360 doritos druid reporting in
---
Never heard of it. Sounds like the type of game with a bunch of shitty sequels and spinoffs
---
&gt;I’ll honestly have to go back and look. I may be incorrect and not taking that specific talent into consideration.  
---
Me too, this argument is based on the wonky assumption that focus regenerates at 25/tick and that 120% of 25 is 30.
---
&gt;Again, I think it’s kind of a moot point because you said you’ll never take that talent in any real practical setting but after this conversation I have to know lol
---
Haha, yes, it intrigues me a lot too, but will probably never put it into practice for a raid.
---
GTA: San Andreas, Team Fortress 2 and DOOM (2016)
---
 Nothing you mentioned has anything to do with a class leader role.
---
You can go AFK while crafting in Retail, not sure about fully disconnecting but i'd assume so if the AFK can kick in, that doesn't confirm it for Classic but its safe to assume it'll work the same
---
Those are decent but it needs at least 8GB of RAM and a SSD instead of that shitty mechanical HDD. Also, check if the newer model has upgraded RAM or processor.
---
AoE grind turns into a chore real fast
---
is that kinda like slither.io?

Currently F1 2019
---
Before that I kind of rotated between FFXIV, ESO, Warframe and Retail WoW. Sadly none of these kept me motivated for long. :/
---
That's awful, it always blows my mind how bad worker protection is for our cousins over there. Y'all need unions.
---
i use shift+t for attack, 6 for follow, 7 for stay, and control +1-4 for abilities. and yes if you want to ultra minmax it autocast is slightly less efficient atleast on the beta than manually casting it because there seems to be a slight delay on autocast that wasn't present during actual vanilla.
---
Games doomed. Play FFXIV. Let the assholes exclude themselves.
---
Please don't uninstall
---
1 more month and we'll find out.
---
Absolutely agree with that.
---
Should be fine for 60fps on low settings. WoW is very cpu heavy so the lack of a dedicated gpu shouldn’t hold you back too much.
---
Trying to get Ahead of the Curve: Queen Azshara in Retail before the day I quit Retail for Classic. I haven't missed an AoTC since I got Archimonde so I at least wanna keep my streak for now. But I know i'll miss whatever the next raid will be, it'll be a worthy reason
---
Runescape and pubg
---
Yes and for 99% of all loot in the game people will use it, the truth is people see a 500g item drop and they don't see the item, they see 500g and "need" 500g because almost everyone in the game can put that to use.

Any tips to increase face to keyboard surface area if I find myself in mirror match?

Hi, I'm running a 1660ti which benchmarks just slightly under the 2060 and when playing in the stress test I never dropped under 100 fps on ultra (my IPS monitor is rated 95hz).. On retail for Legion content and below I had to turn on vertical sync and cap it at 60 fps on ultra and it only drops frames in a few high clutter spots. Classic will have none of that content though.
---
Looks really interesting! How does this spec work in pvp? How much % you lose in heal compared to a holy? Did you leveled in this spec?

Ah, another fellow with a hookup to a professional speed dealer. Call it what you want but it's still methamphetamine when it's said and done. If I had to pick, I'd go with coffee and cigarettes.

So he should buy his friend a $1000 laptop? Are you going to pitch in the other $700? Its a free laptop so his friend can play wow. It will play fine.
---
&gt;Someone would have to assign every piece of gear an individual score for that, GS was based on Ilvl iirc, so it only became relevant when gear from the newest raid tier was always better than in the previous tier, which is obviously not how things are in Vanilla.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Even then it'd be of limited use, the pugging scene in Vanilla is mostly restricted to ZG, AQ20, MC and Onyxia, tiered raid progression makes the addon less influential as you'll eventually need a guild.
---
I think its doable, especially since all items with their stats are available to everyone and BiS lists are everywhere; I wouldn't be surprised if it will exist one day. I just hope the classic server communities have enough resilience to not use those addons.
---
And in regards to your second point: I could see guilds use this kind of shit in their guild application forms too.
---
Also v true
---
With the 3400g out this past week, you should probably look to that instead of a 2200g as the best new entry level cpu/gpu combo.
---
&gt;If you have an enchanter in your group you can agree to let him need on items that nobody else needs and disenchant them. The group will then /roll to see who wins the enchanting mats.

Like I said I loved fury warrior, my DPS was absolutely great once I was decked out, close to the top of raids. The issue was that I had to respec a lot, because I was needed as a tank too. We had a huge guild that had one group in MC while the other group was in AQ. I don't think I ever did Naxx except for the first boss.

Final fantasy VII, playing classic until Remake comes out
---
1. Fel Hunter macro
---
/Cast devour magic target=Party1
---
I forgot the way to do it, but this will cast a dispel on your party member. you can have five of these one for each party member and bind them to keys F1 through F5 for example.
---
This is huge when ice mages freeze you or someone puts magic CC up.
---
2. if you can get howl of terror off, always use it over fear. Because that frees up fear.
---
3. do not have felhunter spell lock on autocast. Saved when people are actually casting maybe bind it to a key.
---
4. Curse of tongues on casters makes their life horrible
---
5. You want free up pretty much constantly. Fear--&gt;dots--&gt;fear --&gt;shadow bolts
---
6. Using first aid during fear is great.
---
7. Rogues: they'll probably get the opener on you, but you can blindly mash tab and corruption repeatedly so the second you detect them it dots them.
---
I thought that the phrase "biased estimator" was reserved for statistics that fail to converge to the parameter's true value with increasing sample size, despite being composed of representative members of the population. Was my assumption wrong?

Replayed all SC2 campaigns on a hard difficulty for achievements. I only played it on normal because I only cared about the story really but I was bored. I might clear brutal when classic WoW is re-released.

---
&gt; I really, really disagree with your comment on class specs feeling the same.
---
You probably have much more experience with retail than I do so maybe I'm talking out of my ass, but this is what I mean. In classic, I felt like each spec had a very specific role throughout all parts of the game. I've recently been leveling a hunter and I honestly can't tell which is the "leveling spec" and which is the "dps spec". Everything dies so fast. This might just come down to the game being too easy now. I can solo groups that would have wiped 5 mans in vanilla.

&lt;TBD&gt; {Alliance PvP} {West Coast Semi-Hardcore} {LC} 
---
What are our goals?
---
	Ours will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner. We intend to be a top guild, competing for world bosses and fastest raid clear times. We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server. The infrastructure is in place for that to happen, but we are still looking for good players to fill the final positions. At the start there will be competition for raid spots which will transition into performance  expectations. 
---
	Raid times will be Saturday and Sunday from Noon PST - 4 pm PST. Generally we will form alt-raids, pvp, and smaller raids outside of our main raid times.
---
	We will be active in pvp but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and gank squads will be encouraged. Battleground premades will be formed if there is  sufficient interest. You can choose to join the guild in a pvp-only capacity. 
---
What is our experience?
---
We have a strong core of knowledgeable and skilled officers to allow the guild and raids to run smoothly. Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel’Thuzad before TBC was released. We already have a group of highly skilled players who have recently cleared Naxx. 
---
Still have questions?
---
Please feel free to contact an officer and they can answer any questions you may have; or direct you to someone who will.

&gt;He didn’t say anything about race making you a better person, since you seem so hung up on that. He said race doesn’t matter.
---
The question was which race is better.... he answered it by saying regardless of what extremists say, it doesn't matter.  As in, no race is 'better' than the next.  Learn your fucking context before you get stupid again.
---
&gt;I’m sorry I took a snipe at white people. Mea culpa. I’ll keep in mind not to say anything bad about white people, because lord knows they have enough shit to deal with in their lives, like getting a college degree or shifting the distribution in their 401k or paying their lawyer to keep their kids out of jail.
---
Your racism clearly can not be any more clear than it is right now.  After this comment I'm done speaking to you, I'd rather not associate with an actual racist piece of fucking shit.
---
&gt;Sorry your feelings got hurt, because that’s what’s important here. I didn’t mean to make you reply to post after post of attempts to get you to realize “oh, maybe race isn’t as simple as a Saturday morning cartoon lesson”. Sure glad you put me in my place because you sir are definitely right and I have no place lecturing you on race being a bit more complex than whether or not you’re a good person.
---
Yeah there's nothing more to say here, you're just a piece of trash.  Have fun with your racist life and keep blaming everything on white people, maybe someday it will get you what you're looking for

You can't drink potions while transformed? Makes sense in an rp way, but do you have a source on that?
---
They seemed to be asking about 1v1 so I just spoke to that with my suggestions 
---
You can keep 1 ofc, I’m just saying keeping it around in the bag is helpful, just like a health stone. You can often see your opponent before you engage, it’s a great time to switch it on.
---
His response was to OP title "How much does race matter for leveling" 
---
He responded with race not mattering because, like in real life, there is no distinct racial trait that makes you superior or better than any other race. 
---
Context 
---
Context
---
Be aware of your surroundings when using your own interpretation.
---
They actually gave the highest threat capabilities of all tanks in vanilla via MCP.
---
&gt; I've recently been leveling a hunter and I honestly can't tell which is the "leveling spec" and which is the "dps spec". 
---
Is that really a *bad* thing, though? Don't get me wrong, I agree that it seems like there's been a huge drop in class/spec identity (mostly due to so many options being taken away over time), but the idea of a spec being "the one you play until max level and then never touch it again" isn't really great design.
---
For an intermediate player the difference between Arms and Fury are fairly minor. Arms is generally better if you level with a healer, although Fury is better if you plan to spend a lot of time in dungeons. The power talents for each tree are Tactical Mastery+Anger Management, Sweeping Strikes, Enrage, Flurry and ofc Mortal Strike and Bloodthirst.
---
As for what weapons to use, the best weapon you can get your hands on. It's that simple. You can use 2-hander as either spec and dual-wield as fury. If you're having a hard time comparing 1-handers and 2-handers a 1-hander is equally strong to a 2-hander with 30% more dps (it's ok if your off-hand is a little weaker). So a set of 30 dps 1-handers are just as good as a 39 dps 2-hander.
---
Supaplex, Kommander Keen 1 through 4, the incredible machine... you know, the usual.
---
Some people are just mean as fuck dude. It looks fine. Enjoy it!
---
Unfortunately, it has no respawn, and death is the only win condition.
---
You don't need Prot to tank. If anything being Prot makes it slightly more difficult.
---
and then someone casts frost nova and you remember why none of that is true
---

I can see the “WTF HEALER” and disconnect now
---
The mage who did it said there's no way that time is possible on live servers because the server he did it on (silver hand from lightshope) has massively boosted spawn rates which he abused to aoe grind with. While the private server mechanics might be close, the spawn rates combined with aoe grinding is a perfect storm.
---
Blackout in PVE is like boomkin stun: You never want it because usually you are trying to pull something and it gets stunned, the patrol shows up and sees he's in combat and runs at you, aggroing the whole rest of the world.
---
1440P is a huge visual upgrade over 1080P.
---
To preserve some performance you can remove anti-aliasing.
---
I think the old record will definitely fall on wow classic, but I don't see how on launch.
---
Stealth near some common quest mobs and wait for someone to overpull.  Murder them then.
---
Lmaoooooo might check out then
---
Thanks for the link, that's very interesting. I'm surprised 1440 was that low, and that 4k was even over 1%.
---
Yeah but you can easily trick a friend into flagging pvp on, just ask them to buff you with yours ticked on
---
filthy casual
---
how do you value 3% extra speed on stealth more than 15% crit chance on ambush though
---
&gt; They seemed to be asking about 1v1 so I just spoke to that with my suggestions
---
Oh. Well ok then.
---
I thought everyone hated him for lying about knowing things from certain sources, for his strict #nochanges and for thinking that he is the best warrior ever while being shit.
---
Personally, I don’t watch him anymore because I disagree with a lot of his opinions regarding #nochanges, especially his view on progressive itemisation
---
because it's talking about 5mans
---
 Thats the Updated core u dingus. Ely(server that took over for NOS (og lights) got the Nos Core that they used preshutdown. Guess what it didnt have bud? leeway. It got reported on Ely launch and eventually added because it was discovered mid 2016 and added to K2 soon after. :)))))))))))) yikesbrain

---
Nice guide! I'm so torn between alchemy or engineering!
---
Actually I’m starting old stuff again while waiting, decided I’d play fable 2 again
---
Engineering is strongly recommended for tanking. A good mix with engi is ofc mining, but something like herbalism just to make gold and then you can buy the mats you need might be better for you. Mining has some synergy with dungeons like DME and BRD where as herbalism is more of a riding around in the world kind of thing.
---
I'm so excited to spent time with Vanilla as it's meant to be- before Blizzard fucks it all up.  You all know it's going to happen.  It's only a matter of when.  Enjoy Classic while you can, lads.
---
Blackout personally saved me numerous times. I will take it but not going to tell you it is mandatory.
---
Playing on private servers and sandboxing classic, trying to figure out which class I really want to play this time.
---
I like it! I'm going troll though so I had this idea of proccing it off shadow guard while leveling
---
Maybe "Leveling spec" isn't the right idea. Here is what I remember from vanilla (so I might be wrong about this). I felt like beast master was the best for leveling. It had the most sustain and your pet kept aggro. You would just pull and auto down the enemies. Very good for solo stuff and therefore usually used for leveling, but also for questing in general. Survival had a lot of traps and immobilizers. I never specced into that but I assumed it was for PVP. Then there was marksmanship which was the highest dps but at the cost of pulling aggro from your pet. Not the best for working alone, but in a dungeon it was great as long as the tank could hold aggro. 
---
I don't see that kind of distinction anymore between specs, although I don't play THAT much so that just might be my perception. It just seems ironic that now, you can finally switch between specs so quickly and easily, and yet I don't see a good reason to.
---
What are the roles of hunter specs in WoW right now?
---
Used to “pug” BWL. Partially gearing alts and the partially actual people who don’t know wtf they’re doing. People used to do it for aq40 too.
---
Just saying "reverse engineer" doesn't tell me much about authenticity or accuracy. What was the means, methods in this example? Was this function part of the guesswork, or was it actually found verbatim? Reverse engineering is great, but it's not always a process of simply reproducing code "word-for-word". But instead an analysis of the end program, and writing new code that follows the observed behavior. Like following a Software Development Life Cycle in reverse. 
---
The issue becomes how well can we observe the end behavior? In the case of leeway it has variables tied to multiple factors, such as the latency of the client recording, the latency of their target, and the performance of the server at that particular time. I mean if we're thinking about it, why does the client code factor in so heavily here? The idea is that you can hit a target from additional distance, but the entire reason you need that behavior is because your client doesn't know exactly where the target is due to lag (and I'm not saying significant lag, any lag between what they do, and the time it takes to reach the server, and then your client). Ultimately the one who is going to resolve whether or not something hits based on leeway, is the server.
---
Stop whining
---
&gt;more than hunter ammo.
---
Would've listed if OP didn't, also I missed it when it was gone.
---
But.. but.. can not compute.
---
Mostly Civ 6, AoE 2, Anno 1800, Rocket League and Subnautica
---
Yeah, and blizzard doesn't want those to happen and actively act against said people, what a great example...
---
Multiboxers have been confirmed fine by blizzard multiple times
---
Go nelf my man. If you're a good rogue, you're a good rogue. Racial is only going to matter when it comes to 1v1 against the best of the best. Ganking some plebs in Silithus or WSG wont be any different as long as you can play your class. Enjoy your stronger stealth and amazing looks :)
---
Pserver until recently, now EQ progression server.

I’ve marked this conversation. I’ll check it out later tonight on my hunter on ndale which should be similar. I’ll let ya know

9 days of freedom! I hope to be level 40 with mount bought in that time.
---
Are they gonna call it an i11 or an iII or ill? All those are different
---
Tekken
---
Lol thank you
---
Yeah, the 3400G will outperform the 2200G if mostly because of the better single-core performance (which isn't huge, but is measurable). If I were building a small form factor PC today, I'd definitely toss a 3400G in there.
---
Farming MCPs not too bad if stuff is on farm. Would just be 30 minutes for like 2 days when you get on, or just do it on a Saturday session. That being said, it is extra effort so I get the aversion.
---
Classic is less demanding than Retail, so yes.
---
We are ready
---
* Defense does absolutely nothing for crushing blows. Warriors can push crushing blows off the table with shield block. 
---
* Crit/Crushing blow avoidance isn't as sought after as it used to be. A lot of warriors will try to switch to Dual Wield Fury tanking ASAP in order to increase threat generation.... which is usually the limiting factor on pserver raids.
---
Druids are superior than warriors, even DW Fury, in terms of threat generation.
---
Druids do have crushing blow mitigation with being easily able to reach armor cap and high health pool for a large effect health buffer.
---
Most guilds generally want a feral offtank.
---
Begone!!!
---
Rather just greed roll on it.
---
1080p in 2019?
---
Skarms channel on YouTube is really worth checking out. He has a video going into detail about this. Also another redditor posted a nice video he made earlier this month of different specs to pick up along the lvling process which you can find here:
---
https://youtu.be/XW2g3Xcucqg
---
The general consensus is you can easily put all your points into fury to tank for lvls 1-40 using dual 1 handers to generate threat quicker. 40-60 is described in the video recommending an arms/prot spec. After proper gearing at 60 you can go the classic fun fury/prot spec everyone is raving about which is shown in both skarms and the linked video. Also nothing wrong with throwing on a shield as the fury/prot spec during certain encounters/situations or until you obtain better gear.

I just realized they need to make this in VR Chat. Run around IF/SW/ORG etc and use wow skins
---
retail and classic tradechats might end up looking the same: an endless flood of sellrun spammers
---
Break out the purple stuff, or this shit’s gunna stain...

Smaller server size, no account-wide info/achieves and no cross-realm should mitigate this a bit, but yeah, people will still try.

One of the biggest reasons why I quit in wotlk - gearscore suddenly made people retarded and it destroyed how the game was played and perceived.
---
Have you even read the sub rules? Check out rule 7
---
Just curious how/why are they going to do character creation that early? So I can open the game log in crest my character but have to sit on it for 2 weeks before launch?
---
Ive played a lot on pservers and I almost wished they had a hardmode classic. I was thinking of servers blizz would release on "hard mode" where all dungeon/raid bosses and mobs would have like 50% more hp and 20% more damage. 
---
How does this relate to offspecs? Good question, you can make your own hardmode by raiding with a bunch of offspecs!
---
Think of a guild of mainly pvpers. I mean, one of the main themes of wow is to get good gear from raids so you can be more effective in pvp. But this guild of pvpers doesn't want to pay 100g a week to respec from pve to pvp spec. So they just raid as their pvp specs cause they are hardcore! 
---
here is an example:

Thoughts?
---
SWTOR. It's definitely a single player game first and MMO second. The playerbase is pretty dwindled as well. But damn if it isn't fun slaying some things with a lightsaber while basically playing KOTOR 3 for free.
---
No clue how end game is, haven't played it since like 1.0, but I hear it's not good and pvp videos look more bland than retail somehow.
---
Going to go out on a crazy limb here, the statement they are trying to make is 'i have an emotional connection to this thing'. I know, mind boggling.
---
They stop it because it chews into their gold selling deals with the chinese
---
So you’re playing classic wow on classic internet? ;)
---
Sure gearscore is cool but it is about nostalgia;
---
*Selects character
---
*right click

*Inspect
---
Meets requirements /invite &lt;character name&gt;
---
Doesn’t meet requirements “spams trade chat again”
---
Honestly beggars can’t be choosers when it comes to a healer. You can still do instances lower geared just need to make smart pulls.
---
Apparently yes that will be the only thing that links
---
Swiftness pot recipe is a world drop. Will cost more to buy it if it’s even available then you would make selling everything from this guide.

Dark time in my life and I’m ready for it to be over. I deserve any crap I get. Always Uber or lyft guys. A dui will turn your life upside down even if nobody is hurt , which was the case for me thank god. I go to bed every night sad about what happened and my life has been a blur since January , barely able to think about things other than my job and the dui I got. Seek help , to anyone who casually might drink and drive . I waited too long to address my drinking problem and it resulted in one of the worst things I’ve done In my life — thinking I was okay to drive. I have 3 days community service which will be done by classic release. Then I have DMV school to take for the next few months on Saturdays instead of no lifing WoW. I deserve it all. Just happy it’s not worse.
---
You can level straight up the arms tree all the way to MS. The arms tree has some excellent talents for AoE threat. You'll also do decent DPS when solo.
---
You can level as 2h fury all the way to bloodthirst and be fine tanking low-level 5m dungeons. The fury tree makes excellent single target threat. You'll also do decent dps while solo.
---
Either of these will have plenty of mitigation as long as you put a shield on and use shield block. It *really* doesn't matter. Just pick whichever one you like more. I personally go Arms all the way.
---
&gt;Should I use a sword and shield leveling?
---
Use a big slow 2h while solo grinding and put a shield on when you tank.
---
&gt;Dual wielding is kind of ass if I remember correctly.
---
That is correct. The lack of +hit gear at low levels makes this very bad.
---
Even if you’re only getting one per boss you’re understating the effort at an hours worth of farming a week.   15 would probably be a safe amount to account for wipes and such.  At a 33% drop rate that’s bout 45 runs a week on average.  Less with good luck and more with bad luck. No chance you’re completing 45 runs on average in a couple of 30 minute sessions.
---
Cool. I’m sure you’ve reported it, so let the mods decide if they want to remove it and quit being the internet hall monitor.
---
how tf you pug vael, or have everyone have an onyxia cloak
---
With backstab build the rogue can do way more damage with a pet tanking.
---
Tabletop Simulator and Mordhau
---
If it were up to me, it would be like $30 to filter out spergs.
---
but potions of rage would be useless anyway
---
If you want to make gold while leveling, get 2 gather professions and swap out later for engineering or blacksmithing.. you could even farm the mats you need before you swap
---
How do you macro or set this up?
---
its not for JUST classicwow. Just because thats all YOU would play doesn't mean thats what you are getting for your money.
---
That would be like viewing a house with 14 bedrooms in it then complaining about how big a rip off that is because you only need 1 bedroom. Like what?
---
I think we can expect a DX12 update to be the next thing on Blizzard's to-do list after the launch bugs get ironed out. 
---
Blizzard has said the whole reason Classic is built on the modern engine is because they want to keep the two codebases close. It makes sense we'll get engine updates, then.
---
There's a blood Elf that's a quest giver in Stone Talon Mountains, I think that's the original BE model.
---
Yes you can have wow1 and wow2 logged in at the same time if you have paid the monthly sub for both.
---
Im being facetious and yes inflation is a small factor, but 15/month is not asking too much. People pay for so many monthly things, this is just another option and not overpriced unless you wont use it.
---
It lets you instant cap flag in AB.
---
You laugh but it's still the best pvp game on the market.
---
High elf isn’t it?
---
To be datamined
---
A streamer’s server probably lmao
---
Yea but vanilla gear is vanilla gear. There isn’t 80 million variations of it that you get from a weekly chest or boss or world quest. The gear on a scale to bfa is so small there isn’t a need for a gear score.
---
I have a wow classic shortcut on my desktop, when i click on it it launches the battlenet launcher with this picture.
---
the literal code for all forms of leeway as of patch 5.4.8 [https://imgur.com/a/RuCPmkK](https://imgur.com/a/RuCPmkK). The fact leeway changes when slowed 30%+ in-regards to abilities on beta gives this more credibility imo.  
---
Combine this with the fact after the slowed animation change mid wotlk (always use running animation) This change enabled you to use abilities when slowed as well.
---
Add all this up Slow effects leeway on beta but not auto attack leeway. Leeway post slow animation change in midwotlk up to current wow has full leeway even when slowed. Leeway on beta and retail isnt active when using rp walk keybind or backpedaling proving that running is a specification. To me that gives the argument leeway(when slowed) is buged a lot of weight. 
---
I mean think about it. Logically it doesnt make sense. Why would autos leeway work when slowed but abilities not? If u argue because autos get leeway when walking. Then why dont u have auto leeway when rp walking? Rp walk is slower than a 30% slow. Ok then why do u have auto leeway even when slowed 70% on beta?
---
also when i say slowed 30% heres an example "Use Curse of Exhaustion on target, target is now at 0.7 of normal movement speed, target starts walking. use Curse of Exhaustion on target which has a 8% increased movement speed boot enchant, target is now at 0.76 of normal movement speed, target will still be "running"
---
Just wanted to say that s.priest is a pretty simple class to get a handle on so don’t feel too much apprehension diving in head first.

Here’s a resource I’ve found pretty helpful

---
Of the healing classes, druids have the most viable DPS spec with feral cat.  It does require a lot of extra work in terms of farming MCP’s, and the rotation is a lot harder to pull off optimally than any other DPS class in Vanilla. Very rewarding and fun to ply though.
---
You’ll have no issues whatsoever finding a raid spot if you go resto. 
---
They can also tank fairly well (all non raid, and off tank in raids) for whatever that’s worth to you.
---
Either mods fell asleep, or they don’t agree with your assessment. I wonder.
---
They were not common in Vanilla, but things have changed with the private server meta. But as you can see from this thread the stigma remains and the issue is still debated.

What specifically would you like to know more about?
---
When Feral's BiS helm requires level 40, and weapon requires level 29... Gear score will hinder more than help. (And feral tank's BiS trinket is blue, too...)
---
Says the guy touting that Fortnite is the paramount of pvp skill.
---
DP and sustain don't belong in the same sentence
---
I would pay 45 a month the fact is wow has brought me more hours of enjoyable gameplay by far then any other game $15 seems more then fair to me to have stable servers and do not have to worry about losing all my progress.
---
So what you're saying is, with such a small library of items to catalogue, it would be a relatively small data entry job to go through BIS spreadsheets and assign arbitrary values in descending order/by raid?
---
That's all true, but wouldn't the use be extremely limited? Like a caster stacking stamina or intellect instead of spell damage/healing, or the requirements of certain resistance gear or race specific defense cap? I'm quite certain that it would be more than likely that we would see addons to calculate either gearscore (for pre-raid gear perhaps) or similar, I just doubt we will see a widespread use, as it's very situational and rather useless for most raid content.
---
The problem with all of this #nochanges is that we don't know if people will even want to play pure classic servers. This all started from private servers. They showed that classic "ish" servers could be popular. There's stuff that we put up with, in original classic, that would be totally unacceptable now. Rolling server restarts, server downtimes that could span days, and insane bugs where people could 1 shot raid bosses. 
---
I think it's a mistake to try and make a "pure classic experience". What they should do is remake the experience that was proven to be popular on PS. Before people start typing to disagree with me consider what Blizzard is already doing. They aren't taking the time to redo 1.1 talents, skills, and items. What we're getting in August is actually closer to most private servers than it will be to the original 1.1 release. Some mechanical issues will be closer to the original, but classes like druid will feel far more like the PS 1.12 version than original 1.1.

Good for you. But believe it or not, not everyone has the same feelings or same capabilities. People have anxiety and depression, and oh shit, feelings. He’s self conscious about his Autism, and assholes using the term on the internet to refer to something as bad, is going to make people like him feel like shit.
---
There is a difference but not massive usually so all comes down to prices of both.
---
I woke to this comment in my feed and my day is going very well now
---
they could
---
Maybe if they ever make WoW 2
---
Lord of the Rings Online! Surprisingly lively population with large updates still rolling out.
---
It isnt just doable, its been done. In the beta a guy asked about people using this group finder addon he put in tradechat by name. But everyone berated him and laughed at him.
---
Its not necessarily about whether its possible. Its about whether people would accept it. And they wont.
---
But Im sure someone is going to try it and be surprised that people that campaigned for classic for 10 years, and are now paying 15$ a month to escape crap like that actually **dont want it**...
---
The entertainment value is off the charts if you ask me. 15$ a month for the amount of fun I get is extremely worth it. The hard pill to swallow is retail wow asking me for like 60$ and THEN 15$ a month on top. That shit hurts my soul but I digress
---
As a druid I always get jealous of all the bursting classes that can blow an opponent into oblivion. Even though a druid can pretty much beat every other class, we have to outlast the opponents damage and slowly tickle them down. Sometimes I wish I could just soulfire crit a poor warrior or cold blood eviscerate a priest.
---
But then I roll other classes and I miss my self sustain and mobility too much, haha
---
Yeah keep telling yourself that lol
---
There isn’t a need. It’s already known what works, what gear works. The BiS has already been done figured out- a program would just make it easy for those who haven’t vanilled. Even then looking at normal progression is as easy as google.
---
It’s so much better to have magical items that just don’t work. It requires a little more thought and rounds out the world so much more.
---
Fairly certain that not how that works, unless you have a video or something to show different.
---
I'm not in favor of gearscore, but here's so many ways it could be done that the "ilvl =/= better in vanilla so it won't work" reasoning people throw out is laughable. For example, you could define stat weights for each class and compare current stats vs bis available to give you a score out of 100.
---
What server is getting deleted?
---
I got to say that everyone who only plays classic will be very profitable customers for blizz. Since most of their expense is in retail.
---
This is the blood elf from the intro cinematic for BC.
---
Gear score came out at a time when items from newer raids weren't always better. It was a pretty common complaint at the time that a higher gear score doesn't necessarily mean better gear.
---
Uh...yeah...lol
---
This guy often mt’s feral fro a top guild on p.servers. Has some good insight on the subject. Also plays war and has a piece vids comparing them without bias imo

You literally don't know what gearscore is used for, do you?

Us kids got them for mowing the grass!

Do you think my CPU will be able to cut it?
---
I don’t bfa but I assume it’s some simcraft bs.
---
Not a bad idea really... I have thought about it
---
The trick is not recruiting clueless morons 😉
---
Sadly yes, I guess if nothing else I'll be getting the full classic experience!
---
&gt; Private server population is not an unbiased estimator of general population.
---
People in the beta test berated people who tried to use grouping addons too. But Im sure you have some magic reason that doesnt count either.
---
Doesnt take a rocket scientist to see that the community will reject that shit. They are playing a 15 year old game specifically to escape stuff like that. Surprising that people think otherwise.
---
There was a GS addon made for TBC pservers. Do not underestimate the power of the internet.
---
Warriors are best tanks, best DPS, top tier group PVP, good solo PVP, is there any other class that competes on as many levels?
---
For leveling? Not at all unless you want a specific rep reward.
---
Can’t name them on this subreddit. The really high pop one is deleting everything. Which is great, it stands behind the idea that they aren’t doing it because it’s free, they’re doing it because Blizzard doesn’t offer it. So deleting it when Classic releases was their plan
---
Yeah if there is one melee class I could maybe pull off it could be ret.  The trouble is all my friends are deadset on horde (I should have mentioned that lol)
---
I just checked, they're also Warrior only potions \^\^
---
Counter strike
---
It's $15 for two games. 
---
Whether or not you play both is irrelevant to Blizzard. When TBC comes out (I presume) it will likely be $15 for 3 games, Wotlk ... 4 games.
---
Yes, like I said, just a bit slower than a full blown desktop though.  You will definitely enjoy FPS around 100-144 in most areas, cities will drop lower of course for everyone. How low only time will tell but it should never be unplayable at all.  It's a strong mobile CPU.
---
BWL is easily pug-able especially after phase 5 is out a while (long time away, I know, but just saying)
---
Or forever, if you're a druid.

Its baseline, but easily doiable thanks to spell batching

Are you a cheese salesman, cause that's a good pitch.

Beast master Hunter if you lag for a minute at least you and your pet will still continue to auto attack the target. So not much dmg goes missing during a lag spike.

Imagine being broke enough to post this
---
Just goes to show Actiblizz isn't taking this seriously :^)
---
I've been playing Factorio and Divinity:Original Sin 2. Both great games that are easy to lose entire nights into.
---
A fact that you've thoroughly failed at even trying to disprove which makes sense because you've clearly never experienced an ounce of competitive fortnite if you don't understand the absurdly high mechanical skill cap of it and you're likely shit at mobas as well.
---
Go Google some competitive fortnite and appreciate the deep complexity of the game.
---
You’re not actually playing Classic WoW.  You’re playing current WoW which is honestly a completely different game.  Just want to make sure you’re aware of that.
---
But for professions, you’re limited to two.  There are gathering professions (skinning, mining, herbalism) and then crafting professions (Alchemy, Enchanting, Engineering, Leather Working, Tailoring).  You can pick whatever combo you want, but I’d suggest picking a gather profession and then pairing it with the applicable crafting profession if you’re just starting out.  Just google each of the professions I’ve listed above to get more info on them.
---
There are also secondary professions that don’t count towards your two primary professions.  These are cooking, fishing, and first aid.  You can learn and level all of the secondary professions.
---
Skinning: obvs has to be a skinnable beast (cat, bear, etc). You completely loot it, and when you hover back over it, the cursor icon will change to a skinning option. Just click
---
Herbalism: just look for small plants all around and click them
---
If you have a crafting profession, like leatherworking, it will be in your skills under the General tab, give her a click and you can figure it out from there. 
---
For the collecting professions, you'll need to see a Trade Supplies salesperson and get the correct tool.
---
Characters on the same wow1 account don't even share lockouts i believe.   Do you want characters logged in to go to same raid or you just trying to avoid a lockout?  If you are just trying to avoid lockout then characters don't share lockouts at all.  Only the characters in that raid share the lockout.
---
That's fair, they are team-oriented but their dominance is still linked to 1v1 when people discuss them being "OP". Mana issues aren't necessarily a deal-breaker and aren't even much of a problem if you don't mind buying mana pots. But sform itself is like 600 mana, so while you shouldn't always be in it it's also impractical to liberally flip back and forth. In BGs I would be drinking after ~2 "lengthy" (30+ second) encounters, which I think is par for the course with SPriests. Just something to keep in mind.
---
I mean it depends on what you are looking for? For me 15 dollars a month for hours of entertainment is saving money, because I will just be sitting infront of the PC instead of being other places that is trying to rip me of my money.
---
Do you need spell hit for pvp?
---
Oh forgive me edgiest of edge lords. For I do not keep up with WoW as it is. Perhaps you could enlighten with your bbqwtfpwn 1337ness instead of being a twat.
---
&gt;Hey, so the 8.2 trailer on the main page is actually part of an advertising unit - interspersing the ads with a WoW video clip is quite profitable, way more than static image ads, which in turn has funded a lot of this past year's site development. I don't know if we can ask the company that handles the video unit to have a different set of videos showing on the Classic site, but it's worth a shot. Just wanted to clarify that the purpose of that section of the site was an advertising unit, not Wowhead trying to give people a rundown on cinematics. I can see how it can be kind of weird to see BFA videos on Classic though.
---
ah ok I understand that
---
&gt;Do you have an example of the item results linking to transmog?
---
sure! so it seems to have been removed from the item pages themselves: [White Wedding Dress](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6837/wedding-dress). However, the search *results* still pull up [all sorts of guides from BfA](https://classic.wowhead.com/search?q=wedding+dress#guides).
---
appreciate the feedback, and I will most certainly get a lot of use out of the new phase filter!
---
But people did gear check in vanilla and will in classic.. or are you just talking about "gear score"
---
Uhm.. ree? i mad
---
Jesus Christ I’m an idiot lol.
---
Moonglade!!
---
Woupd be but wont happen. There is nothing new to discover in classic most of us had been there 14 years ago.
---
Very unlikly there will be content after nax.
---
Classic will have playera but i feel less will log in over rime when they have done all it has to offer them and advances no story.
---
For me priest's lack of mobility is super annoying. In retail they at least have feather or PW:S providing a mobility boost, in classic those are sorely missed.
---
It's one we're actively looking at - we assigned it to a developer for our current sprint. Hopefully it won't be too complicated of a fix.
---
You could just rate by primary stats
---
This is retarded
---
It would be very cumbersome, and many lack the level of introspection it takes to really be honest with yourself and find true happiness.  Results may vary.
---
Rocket league and Lidl Rocket league (lucioball)

Minecraft. If you haven't played in a while, there is lots more to do with updates, new achievements to get etc. and new items if you're into creative/cheat enabled modes.
---
I've been playing BFA a couple days a week just doing transmog runs to complete some outstanding stuff, I tried achievement hunting for a bit, but got over that after a couple weeks.
---
It amazes me that people were even able to kill bosses while playing like that. The only curses that are up is agony. I see like 6 serpent stings instead of good debuffs, judge of wisdom/light is rarely up, no faerie fire, hardly even sunder armour is up. Yet he's defeated anyways.
---
Brings back memories. I had a similar connection and remember tanking Karazhan and disconnecting on the Curator then frantically mashing the connect button to get back in. Yay for voidwalkers they were all still alive when I re-logged :D
---
All your warriors should be sundering as their first ability.  Instant 5 stacks.  Let's the tank shield slam and revenge for 30% more damage right off the bat.
---
Waiting for the first tank to get 3 sunders then go into his rotation is less threat than what I mentioned above.
---
Do you multibox because you don’t have any friends?
---
If you’re losing a PVP encounter, reapply your dots before you die. Losing and watching the person who killed you die seconds later is the best kind of losing.
---
$15 a month for Wow classic and the retail game up to the current warchest cap

Why would I give a fuck about increasing their revenue? And obviously not everyone disagrees if it's a topic that's been beaten to death. I was asking a simple question and you fanboys went full attack mode. Fucking pathetic. And if it's an old topic yall sure as shit ain't tired of responding to it. A rational thinker would've continued scrolling but triggered trolls do exactly what's happening here.

I think for gold selling the best thing to do is community enforcement, spam F when they advertise in chat and discourage it. Remind friends when they buy gold they are promoting bad server health and people hacking accounts. This is what I have seen done in PoE and it works fairly well. One thing I liked about vanilla was community solutions to problems, like the the pandemic solutions to hakkar's corrupting blood debuff when it hit cities. Even complete server balance of 50/50 sounds boring. I hope I am the underdog so i can work with my faction to plan some goofy world PvP.

I remember when Trial of the Crusader came out in Wrath. Literally the week after it came out, pugs required achievements for finishing it to even be invited.
---
Like, if I was in a guild capable of doing the raid to get the achievement, why the fuck would I be looking to pug it?!
---
Given the number of early items that are too good to replace until later raids, ilvl would be pretty hit and miss in vanilla.
---
Overeat for the month leading up to classic. Double chin can cover more keyboard surface area.
---
That's exactly what will happen.
---
Same with addons / sites to find groups, aka lfr.
---
Ah, I dunno.  After what they pulled with they beta I'm pretty sure all it boils down to these days is money for activision/blizzard.  They originally had the stress tests spaced out so you would have to sub another month to get in each one.  I don't think consumer/fan would come first in their eyes these days.
---
Yea not gunna bite. “Oh you dunno what x is blahhhhh” and with that you are ignored.

Gearscore doesn't eliminate feral from a pug invite, being feral already does that.

Wave management, jungle pathing, warding, resource management, build orders, power spikes, champion picking, ban phases, objective control, the game has far more depth to it, and a level of nuance that shooters simply don't possess. Am I saying that there is no skill involved in Fortnite, absolutely not. Simply, there are far more variables to account for in a Moba, and an overall skill level that is reflected by that. You saying that the overall skill behind a Moba is "last hitting" and "animation canceling" is such a small part of the game, that you clearly haven't played in the new age of moba games. I'm not saying it's an easy game, there are simply less variables to account for.
---
My loss, I'm sure.

Did you see how many died in the last belf mission of frozen throne though.   A good 30 or so bit it in the premission cinematic.

Imagine if you showed up on /r/cars in a thread about which car had the most horsepower, and you started arguing that your bike was faster because you can totally outrun a horse. That's what you're doing right now, lol.
---
But to be nice: gearscore is a literal score of your gear based on item level -- it isn't an optimization thing, it's used as a marker by PUG raid leaders to pick people for raids.
---
For mining you need a mining pick which can be bought off of a vendor. Beyond that, certain nodes require certain mining skill to be able to mine them. In either case you should see a message with the reason you can't mind pop up.
---
You knew it was a decent player because you could name all the pieces they were wearing.
---
truth hurts, its okay
---
That level 40 helm also stayed BiS for feral until halfway through WotLK when they changed energy to a steady gain instead of tick based lol.
---
Hilariously assholish to declare him ignorant when youre lacking any depth in your comments so its easy to misunderstand your point.
---
I will argue there can be a variation(this may be your argument), but UBRS/ DM stuff is BiS for some classes for basically a year and a half so thatd have to be valued higher than new gear from Molten Core. So it wouldnt be based purely on stats/armor/when it came out.
---
If this is your argument, you fail to ever explain that in this thread, so its entirely your fault for making him ignorant, and talking past him
---
Priest - Lack of mobility and slows/CC
---
Oh hey look hey got his butt buddies to join in.
---
Wow classic ruined every other game for me, nothing brings me joy... I am constantly checking the timer until the release like it will make it come faster or I just browse forums and reddit. I also started coding an old project of mine out of boredom...
---
&gt; But everyone berated him and laughed at him.
---
This happenes among the beta crowd, but I would imagine the people who end up playing classic will eventually warm up tot he idea of such an addon. Especially if retail players start to migrate to classic.
---
I hope this doesn't happen but I am sure it will eventually.
---
Someone made a list of gear from the raids for the priority spec / class and it’s lit. Somewhere on a google doc that I lost :/
---
Feeling this question directed at me, are warlocks hard to que for dungeons ? Since it is considered a DPS class ?
---
Its just dot and fear basicly
---
It's hard to find room for it, since spirit tap is essential while leveling. It's on option on a pvp server if you plan on trying to fight the other faction frequently, but otherwise I'd focus on regular leveling talents to help you out there.
---
It's $16 for me now. 
---
*Cries in taxes*
---
Thanks for the kind words hahaha
---
now you're changing your argument but this isn't a competition I love mobas.  
---
last hitting and animation canceling is the MECHANICAL skill of it not all the skill.  friend you can't even follow the conversation and you keep backpedaling and not understanding.
---
I won't go into the nuances of fortnite because lets be real, you won't get it.
---
since I don't want to argue against mobas and you want to remain ignorant I will go now.  bye
---
Wut....
---
Thanks for this! I can take my crappy 300€ Laptop with me and farm some items when I'm going somewhere (Or in Uni...Uh oh) 
---
Really useful, well laid out - props!
---
I know lol I couldn't believe when people actually started doing shit like that. It severely divided the population, and those who didn't do end game raids at the beginning usually didn't get into them because of the outrageous requirements.
---
Making someone ignorant. 
---
What, uh, would you say you're a doctor of there?
---
Trust me; i think if subs start to hemorrhage from Classic Blizzard will ditch the #nochanges mentality very very quickly. I think its a fun idea though.
---
Very interesting! I want to check this out. Thanks for sharing.
---
Find guards- they will help show you where trainers are.
---
Find cities, they will have the guards.
---
Follow quest lines and search for towns (quest hubs)
---
You'll get the hang of it - or you'll decide mmorpgs aren't for you :)
---

---
Agreed 100%. No changes at Launch / Class balance patch 1.
---
I always appreciate the whispers. Because I can ignore them and move on, or decide to join when I didn't even have to look.
---
that is great news, Seal Fate is my favorite spec to play. could you share where youve seen this "general consensus threshold" about it being viable in phase2, or anywhere outside of naxx. im my experience and everything ive read has me believing otherwise
---
I played a druid in wotlk, in bird form you can still summon people without leaving your form.  Me and 2 friends would always get a warlock stone set on the edge of the entrance to Naxx, I'd be flying away from the edge and summon someone, as soon as they're summoned they land on my character which is about 300ft from the ground below, then they fall to their deaths.  We usually picked on people who didnt have slow fall spells, sometimes wed randomly invite people  to group and summon them just for shits, good times.

How's the data usage?
---
I too am extraordinarily humble.
---
Discord is basically just guild chat + teamspeak. People who need to get help outside of the guild will still be spamming LFG in chat.
---
Where's the PoE players at?!
---
$15 a month is actually astronomical by game pricing standards.  very few games have ever been able to demand a price like that, now or ever.
---
You'll realise that BC brought many **improvements** to other classes that allowed them to be more competitive in those roles.. can't argue about them being best dps, someone has to be. Druids and Paladins have their own problems that make them sub-par for tanking.
---
Going to comment here for posterity: I think you're very wrong.
---
Consider the sorts of arguments that happen in this sub all the time. A whole bunch of people think that 40 man raids should consist of only optimal specs (as defined by them), and anyone not optimizing their character should be excluded.
---
Those of us that played vanilla know better -- we know that isn't necessary at all! But that's the same as retail. No one needs to outgear every piece of content to clear it, but gear score is prevalent anyway. Why? Because people want the least amount of friction possible in their raids, and the only way you can accomplish that quickly (without adding in more friction on your part) is with gear score.
---
A few months in, people who aren't in a guild will adopt some sort of gear score metric and it will be widely used. Yes, it didn't happen on private servers, but that doesn't mean it won't happen in Classic. Classic will be played by way more than the folks that played on Nost, or whatever other private server exists.
---
I hate it, I think it's dumb, and I think the level of optimization that will occur in Classic just so that people don't have to interact with others more than they want to (which defeats the whole point of an MMORPG, but whatever) is ridiculous, but it is what it is.
---
He aint wrong. 10usd wtf are you joking. Half an hour of work at McDonalds.
---
From looking at the replies, you got way more replies with decent, well constructed points why people feel the $15 is fair, you just don't want to see that and act like a baby instead
---
It's nothing like that....
---
I'm sure they don't care, but Blizzard does.
---
You can't possibly go memer than a melee cloth caster
---
Now that you mention it, I'm not sure. They both shared the same original models from memory
---
Go stand outside the door and find people like how our ancestors did
---
Sorry should probably clarify the instance lockout limit* as in the number of instances that your character is able to create per hour - I believe this is 5 per hour per character in normal classic.
---
I am reading that Blizz changes this at some point to be 10 instances per hour, account wide (I guess since it's easier to have alts and people farm old riads for gold).
---
To be safe I will probably go with a 2nd bnet account - don't want to risk hitting that instances per hour account wide if there is any good farm that relies on it
---
Counting for inflation from 2004, it Should cost $20.33/month
---
I don't think that's how it works
---
There's just going to be a site that uses add-on data to determine DPS and HPS ranks, ranking you against other people on your server. That score will be simplified down to a lower number, easily checked by another add-on, and you'll get invited based on that. 
---
Like Men's Warehouse, I guarantee it.
---
it wasn't
---
Only reason I ask is because I was under the impression that the term ‘Blood Elf’ was created for BC. Prior to that I think they were all high elves.
---
Honestly "Windfury runs" turned me off playing resto shaman. 
---
Bust your ass the entire time, trying to keep up with the melee and not run out of mana so you can boost their epeen DPS numbers, all so you can get a *"WF TOTEM!!"* whisper the second you're late on it cause you had to, you know, heal.
---
Yes if your Bnet account has the pet on it you will have it in classic.
---
If you aren't going to play then fuck off instead of making a pointless thread.
---
Found the pserver champ.
---
Unless you are talking about comparing people in gear that almost no one ever got, and will still likely not be exactly common. 
---
In the beginning, hunters will piss on everyone else.
---
Then come the mages.
---
warlocks make a fair showing all the way through.
---
Rogues... fulfill their niche all the way through.
---
suddenly, only briefly near the end a very very few warriors become absolutely disgusting...
---
And the result is this guy, who clearly never played retail, or else overwrote all his memories with 80iq tipsout type videos.
---
This would cause more problems than benefits. As others have mentioned it would cause "faction stacking" promoting even more out of balance servers.
---
Imagine being ignorant, oh wait you dont have to.
---
I've mentioned it in other posts but the stigma of being a hunter is often overlooked, so you get to be the butt of a lot guild/group jokes regardless of your performance.
---
Don't get me wrong it's not exactly upsetting it just gets tedious very quickly.
---
15 a month for 1.5 years is 18 * 15 = $270.  270 BUCKS for a remake of a game that should cost like $45.
---
PvE servers work more or less the same as war mode in BFA. It's an opt in pvp system.
---
You need to buy a mining pick. Either from a general goods vendor or the NPC that taught you mining
---
I'm on a b.net account that has never subbed, and I have the Classic client. Did you [opt-in to the classic beta](https://us.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html)? Might be that.
---
this is excellent. thanks!!!
---
I'm doing this too! But I guess I'm just wanting to shave off the extra 10 minutes? Next I'll be searching catheters on Amazon...
---
Ok then don't.  If $15 breaks your bank then I absolutely think you should have priorities that don't include a sub to a mmo.  But more than that this pays for servers customer service.  Not to mention this was somehow a 2yr development project I dont claim to understand why, but it obviously took a lot of time and effort to launch classic servers. For me $15 is an absolute bargain for a game you enjoy.
---
I doubt Naxx will be puggable unless there's a guild looking for ringers
---
I would say its more akin to knowingly buying a box of mixed soda but only indending to drink one then complaining you had to pay so much and they should split it
---
Yha you get two things but you did not ask for one. In your example you can get another house. Its more like you when you buy a house you also have to get a car.
---
Still if it cost the same as retail it will be fine because the game is way better. I would buy it and a lot of other people will as wel. So if the sups where separate it probably still be €15.
---
ah i see
---
It's literally been done it was just called item level not gearscore or vice versa
---
&gt; last hitting and animation canceling is the MECHANICAL skill of it not all the skill.
---
You should start playing league then, if it's that simple. You can get paid millions, you know?
---
This is true. Micro Centers are selling 2400G for $100 I believe. That's a pretty damn good price versus a $150 3400G.
---
It will be even worse in classic, cuz these idiots will want the shaman to try to twist totems and/or waste 22 pts in enhancement for improved weapons totems.
---
Bloodelf Paid DLC confirmed!
---
Bring 3 healers with you.
---
But we have tons of changes already. All the changes from 1.1-1.12 wrapped up into one massive clump thrown at us during MC patch. 
---
This nochanges nonsense needs to stop. Rename it #MODERATECHANGES if you want but stop calling it nochanges. There's plenty of changes. The list is pages and pages at this point.
---
Since you're playing retail I would also recommend not to bother with professions before level 110, reason being each tier (corresponding to each expansion) is a  standalone skill now and whatever you craft before 110 will be of little use.
---
Just focus on the leveling.
---
Staysafe
---
Green eyes. Blood elf.
---
Seal of the crusader is one of the best levelling paladin skills in the game since it's flat holy damage that auto refreshes per swing. You open it up on any mob.
---
I forget if it was in vanilla or TBC on heavy raid nights I would need more than a full quiver of arrows and I had the epic quiver, it still really was not an issue. I never had a need to absolutely consume all my bag space and buying ammo before going anywhere should just become ingrained like repairing does for any semi competent player.
---
The cost of the ammo is neglible too when you consider that you can avoid repair costs by not dying on a lot of definite wipes with feign death.
---
I remember GS checks in wotlk on my rdruid.  I had a crap epic trinket from uld equipped and when we started pulling I would equip my old vanilla trinket because it was much better, even though it tanked my GS.
---
It’s $15 lmao
---
Thanks all, I'll try again.
---
it means taco bell dump
---
HOLD DPS
---
-1 minute later-
---
DPS GOOOOO
---
8 Serpent Stings instantly applied to Golemagg
---
Blackout, I'm fairly certain, does not proc on damage over time, it procs on cast. Devouring Plague can only proc blackout once every 3 minutes.
---
Shadowguard works like shaman's Lightning Shield, in that the "cast" is considered the damage it deals, not when you cast the buff. So every orb on Shadowguard, 3 orbs total, has a chance to proc blackout when it deals damage. Meaning 1 Shadowguard buff = 3 possible blackout procs.
---
Me too! Building a fence!
---
&gt; Curse of tongues on casters makes their life horrible
---
To add to this, Curse of Exaustion is insanely potent vs Warriors, Rogues and Shamans. As SM/Ruin is often the go to for early pvp/pve content, making CoEX a great 1 point spell to have. If they have [Faps](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5634/free-action-potion) or a paladin behind them, be sure to use an offensive fel puppy dispel on them quickly and re-apply the curse. This can sometimes fail if the opponent has plenty of magic buffs (i.e. [noggenfoggers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8529/noggenfogger-elixir) or normal buffs)
---
On the topic of consumes, the best two consumes I've found for pvp are [Magic Dusts](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2091/magic-dust) and [Lips](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3387/limited-invulnerability-potion). Magic dusts for CC madness and Lips for enraging warriors or rogues.
---
My 2cents.
---
Oh yeah I remember now, lol. People would actually roll on gear for their "max GS set" just to have a higher GS when applying to groups.
---
Wtf my pp hard
---
Wanna have some WotLK GS PTSD?: "LFM VoA, min 5.5k GS and achivement req".  
---
Starting off raiding wasn't fun.
---
You can build a brand new PC that should handle 1080p high settings at 60+ fps and will likely have no problem raiding at 1080p medium settings at 60+ fps.

I'm a sucker for Madden and FIFA, so that's a pretty good plan.
---
It sounds like you might be playing the retail version of WoW on a starter (free) account? If so you might be able to get more in-depth help at https://www.reddit.com/r/wownoob/
---
Mining and skinning are gathering professions - to craft items you will want a crafting profession that works well with what you can gather (blacksmithing, engineering, or leatherworking for example).
---
I’m not advocating for GS in classic at all, but surely it could be some algorithm based on the actual stats rather than manual assignment? I know that’s easier said than done but still seems like a better solution (if this were a problem anyone would ever want to fix)
---
I'm ahead of the game here, already got my alts all planned out too :p
---
There is a blood elf right there, REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Maybe you shouldn’t be playing video games if you’re that strapped for cash. Go to work.
---
Private servers probably wont last another 2 years or so for the ones that try to stay open.  Activision or whoever my buy them out will end up protecting their IP when classic does well.  They will have an easy case in court if they are actively making money off it.  Much harsher penalties as well.
---
I hope so
---
Especially since you generate extra rage on blocks.
---
Seconded for the lazy lock batteries. I just slap a renew on them and call it good. Drinks can turn into a major gold sink when partying with life tap spamming locks.
---
definitely farmed princess on my priest.
---
There was no resilience gear until tbc
---
And that's why I never hit 60 in vanilla haha
---
Retail? Isn't Tukui just a 1.12 version of ElvUI?
---
Also people were replacing the model of Anchor Weed (the rarest herb) to an incredibly large model so they could see it from miles away
---
Look up Moonsti YouTube videos, he does a breakdown of best classes to play with high MS per role
---
&gt; Its just dot and fear basicly
---
Yep
---
&gt; What do you do in WSG vs. AB vs. AV (or what should you be doing)?
---
Defend flag room in WSG, defend bases in AB and join the zerg in AV
---
I think it's just a case of JonTron's video being the "best" of all of the huge amount of videos and articles that popped up at pretty much the same time. He also talked about the situation in a quite more relatable and humerous way than Sodapoppin, Asmongold and Alexensual.. where especially the 2nd and 3rd mentioned were rather controversial within the private-server community.
---
Of course I think the JonTron video had an impact, I just don't think it was as huge as you try to make it sound like. The Nostalrius team and all of the other major personalities were already doing everything they could, along with the rest of the community, to appeal to Blizzard. JonTron's video was a very good morale boost and a perfect video to link to a person who didn't know about the entire situation.
---
Being able to one-shot stealthies that are in stealth with chain lightning was cool though! (I'm assuming this was removed for the version we are getting, but I sure as hell remember it being a thing back in the day)
---
Checkmate
---
Console overwatch
---
This just got me more pumped for Classic then I thought it would. Too funny.
---
Blizzard's redemption arc
---
Because we'll be in 1.12, where aggro had already been nerfed to shit in prep for BC, trivializing tanking.
---
If you are alliance warlock you will typically be conflag spec in group pvp since you lack the on demand burst shamans bring.
---
Thanks bro. But I have the money. What I dont have is the time and other consoles and games to play than to just pointlessly waste cash on a classic re-release every month. Plus I have a brain that can make deductions with my budget unlike these brainless drones that just spend, spend, spend.
---
He said low level pvp
---
i remember seeing the same blood elf on guest passes and iirc game time cards. Who Is She
---
You sound like you think this is Dance Dance Revolution and the only way to win is to hit your perfect 99 point combo.
---
1. Not an asshole
---
2. Communicate with and engage the viewers in conversation 
---
3. As another guy said, no in game posse following them around carrying them through everything
---
4. No corpse camping other players
---
Little hostile there
---
And yet WoW still has hundreds of thousands of people.  Now though you are getting two games for that same price.
---
To ask a question an and get opinions. But I can see that this subreddit is nothing but toxicity and elitism.  Fucking pathetic.
---
That's probably a good call to modify it a bit. It wasn't all bad, but could use some balance tweaks for sure.
---
Still way better than the halo board game!
---
&gt; throwing away money
---
If you think playing this game is "throwing away money"
---
it's not a game for you. Might i suggest https://store.steampowered.com/  to find a game you'd enjoy?
---
Isn't it a one hand weapon?
---
D a p Ee bb
---
I dunno how it was for other servers, trade chat on my realm in retail was dead within 2 months of BFA
---
The same goes for every single class except holy paladin, they all have to respec for pvp.
---
Please don’t. I came back to retail after several years of not playing that GS is what turned me off the most. So much wasted time, so many kicks because the leader found a player with 1 or 2 more points than I had...
---
More like interesting and sometimes unbalanced. Blizz has had this unhealthy obsession with trying to make its game esport friendly. Why do you think we got stuff like item levels and an obsession with perfect balance? Such a small percentage of the playerbase participates in the world first stuff or cares about min/maxing to your fullest potential.
---
It's time for Blizzard to go at least half way and make gear interesting again. I think they have been starting to experiment with it a bit again with 8.2, so we shall see what the future holds.
---
Classic Cast with Esfand is also  great
---
I don't really care about all that I'm just commenting on saying it's not asking much.  it's asking a lot as shown by all those games that tried to ask it and failed.
---
orbwalking? learning individual mechanics of 100+ different champions? lane positioning? The overall apm required to move efficiently in a moba? it's not as simple as you make it out to be. Sorry i'm too stupid to understand anything you're saying.
---
Nothing is free....
---
Instead, meet someone on a bridge or top of bank and have them aggressively inspect and judge you
---
Why can't someone put judgement of wisdom on the boss?
---
Let's leave politics out of it
---
Don't worry I'm sure gearscore will be a thing.
---
maybe just having a bad dat. he deleted his comments so maybe he realized
---
Smith &amp; Engineer for endgame - could also take  mining instead of smithing
---
Item level existed in Classic and BC, it was just hidden from view.
---
You being a woman doesn't mean you hang out with other women. It's pretty clear that you don't if you think we're all free of aggression and competitive natures. Every show and movie with a High School backdrop has catty teenage girls, what you've outlined as being not for girls is the straight up stereotype of teenage girls.  Shooters and Sports games are also not the only PvP games in the world, given that we're talking about MMO PvP I would think you wouldn't link pointless stats but here we are.
---
If I was so broke I couldnt afford $10 a month, I'd be touchy too
---
I don't recommend bringing politics here, Rule 5
---
What you do, and what those pug groups did, is that if you don't have the achievement, you're the one making the group. Invite some friends to show that it's not just an empty raid, then recruit people to carry you.
---
You can't click share your profession in classic right? I don't think so, cause I remember those enchanters that wrote a novel in the trade chat.
---
I suppose you're right, I think he's just trolling though
---
Totally get what you're saying, I'm exactly the same with grass is greener syndrome.
---
That being said: gathering profs to get extra vendor cash or stockpile for taking profs later on is objectively a good idea (provided you're not going for speed leveling).
---
Yea it is actually. Let’s people actually FIGURE OUT what works and what doesn’t rather than just giving you your gear basically.
---
When the elitist mom declares it one.
---
Shaman main here. Nothing indeed.
---
So you go into Toyota dealerships and proclaim "$24,095 for a CAMRY!?!?! in 2004 they were $17,043!!!"
---
Well you're wrong.  You are trying to say they failed because they were $15/mo and that's not the case.  Even if it were, WoW has been chugging along just fine for fifteen years at that same price and still has hundreds of thousands of players.
---
Back when MMOs were a big deal, "hundreds of thousands of players" was good.  You can't call it a failure when it's still [the champ](https://mmo-population.com).  If we assume this is even remotely accurate, WoW is doing just fine at its price point.
---
But now you're getting two games for the price of one.
---
Yes, there are blood/high elves in vanilla. https://wow.gamepedia.com/Former_high_elf_models
---
The blood elf in the cinematic is very obviously based on the BC blood elf models, and also based on the "addicted to magic" lore than was substantially beefed up for BC.
---
I prefer 2 separate battle nets i have my main account from 2005 with wow1 and wow2 plus another Bnet account with one subscription that is my hide from friends account. I only had trouble one time because i was moving large amounts of gold between accounts and it somehow caught blizzards attention and once i talked with a GM everything worked out
---
He's just trolling
---
&gt; Classic is only ~5 GB currently, so you aren’t going to be hurting on space.
---
That really surprised me, considering retail client is like 70+ GB. I mean, I knew it would be significantly lower, but I hadn't expected it to be that low.
---
Who cares?  It's worth it to me at $15/mo.  If it's not to you, don't play.
---
"Giving away" money to businesses providing a service isn't giving money away. It's commerce...
---
&gt;Call me cheap all you want but I ain't broke. And damn sure ain't stupid enough to spend money on shit I wont be using.
---
What kind of ignorabt shit is this? WE will be using it for many many hours. If you don't want to wecdon't give a shit, but painting it as greedy is intellectually disingenuous. 
---
&gt;I'm reading indicate most of yall are either living off your moms credit card or you're a man baby. So which one is it?
---
Are you shitting me dude? We're all in our 30s by now, and most of us have degrees and careers and shit now. You're a huge jackass dude just stop.

Sure, you "can" do anything, but you *will* be a healer.

I was a little worried I wasn't going to finish my AmbiBox/Adalight setup, but I knocked it out on a Sunday evening with some cardboard and masking tape. Other than that, no.
---
Fury has the edge. You can dual wield as fury if necessary. 2Hand tanking is also a thing but only makes sense when you're overgeared.
---
Nice. Hopefully Blizzard can clarify the fuzzy details of loot added in later phases.
---
Ion's tweet is a good basis but not 100% set in stone.
---
