I recently did the King of the Hill style quest in Ashenvale (Horde side) where you defend a hill from a nonstop wave of furbolgs. Ofcourse I invited this one player to join the group who was nearby, but what I didn’t expect was some random warrior nearby walking up seeing the carnage and saying “woah what’s going on?” And explaining it was a chain quest to him and him just saying “Cool, I don’t have it but this looks fun” and we all teamed up to defend the hill until the final shaman came out while the warrior screamed out “Lok’tar Ogar!” among other inspiring phrases as we battled on.

You can play retail if you have a problem with classic raid comps. Not every spec is good for raiding, but almost every spec has some niche viability for raids who aren't trying to be ahead of the curve.

Blizzard release their phases for PVP. Battlegrounds is phase 2.
---
Well, I played both warrior, rogue and priest in vanilla, and classic now again. Being rogue is actuelly very easy to solo with blind, sap, sprint, stealth and vanish, there is now quest I can't solo, quickly. Say you have to kill a certain mob deep inside cave, stealth all the way, sap and blind adds, quickly kill the mob and loot, vanish. Stealth out. 1min in and out. Others spent 5-10min on same quest. Even in groups. I love it. Questing is very easy as rogue.
---
Yeah, it's just distracting and I would prefer not to think about it. But it might be worth it to have the add-on.
---
I don't think it's more probable at all. You have a group to make the quest easier and there was no reason to not invite the guy if there was a spot. On the other hand I can totally see someone getting kicked because it's just a rando
---
Man I swear I wait for everyone to drink up but the moment one of the dps finishes first they HAVE to pull. And then I can’t generate any rage, can hardly get aggro, and everyone’s getting hit BUT me. Then everyone needs to drink between every pull because people go oom kiting and burning down things unnecessarily..
---
This is annoying as fuck even as a non-mage... I play Rogue and these mages aoe grinding are the worst imo.
---
Don't get me wrong, I did this back in vanilla on my mage. But it wasn't as over-crowded as it is now, I wasn't basically stealing everyones mobs.
---
happy cake day
---
I can get it to work about 50% of the time, but i have to spam my macro for about 2 seconds  before it let's me feign trap. Obviously much shittier than it should be but still barely works

It hasn't been solidly confirmed, but in-game speculation from Brann is that they're the descendants of a Wild God. The Wild Gods were/are creations of the Titan construct Keeper Freya.

RealMobHealth should be able to do this. it just a data provider. it has options to make a healthbar below the tooltip but you can turn that off

Is it possible to transfer my pve character to a pvp server? Someone told me that's a feature that's coming but I'm just trying to confirm and get a date so I know if I should just reroll or not :/

" There are no facets of the game where daggers are ever better."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That's where I have to disagree.  Seal fate or prep with daggers is way better for pvp than combat.   Solo leveling, yes, combat is where it is at, but dungeons and raids later dagger builds can do just fine. Hell even if you are questing as a group dagger builds will be perfectly fine, and imo more fun.
---
Most quests are gather not kill. I constantly get invites from druids/priests/warriors while I’m doing gather quests and I almost always decline. If I can tag and kill faster than another player there is no incentive for me to group.
---
Battlegrounds??? [U dumb?](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049)
---
Blizz does care about "in game contracts" (At least they did in vanila). This means that if you make an agreement about loot and someone breaks it they would intervene to enforce the rules.
---
Nope, certainly not. Sorry if my phrasing was unclear, I meant it would otherwise be an option but I assume your main is on a PvE server.
---
I wasnt trying to take away from OP's work, but kind of adding some extra info for people if they so choose to use it. I understand not everyone uses addons!
---
Where do you gather that information? The original CA Had improved crit and improved hit % with the slowest AS on a 2h IIRC. it was perfect for warriors.
---
Would any experienced Hunter mind giving me a screenshot or something of your bars? I'm fairly new to Hunter, as I just hit 30. So many of my abilities are situational and need to be keybound so 'm struggling to find a comfortable setup. I use domino's for my casting bar atm if that matters. Really any suggestions or guides you really like would be awesome.

He declined the group as a class that doesn’t have a quick/insta tag and indicated he would rather compete for them. He lost. You aren’t a jackass, he made the wrong choice and is salty about it. /ignore

My issue with TSM is how annoying it is to set up. I don't want to spend 20 hours learning how to create efficient operations. 99% of the time I just wanna toss a bunch of questing greens onto the AH without making an operation for every type of item.
---
Amen, we brought some trashy fucking specs into vanilla raids.  I'd be shocked if more than 75% of my vanilla guild's roster was raiding in 'optimal' specs until Naxx started putting real pressure on us.  (And please don't read this as 'we were so awesome we didn't have to spec properly', this is far more 'we were knuckleheaded pvp'ers who didn't know what the fuck we were doing'.  I raided all the way through AQ in a fucking smite spec, and they made me the priest class lead.)

All the legion sets were incredible. Except hunters.

3d is a difficult job. Unless youre really good and exp you do alot of contract work. I could have kept working on it and as long as my dad is alive i am afforded the opportunity to study...but when he passes i will need to settle his estate and find a job pretty fast. I was not at that time at a level to be employed nor would I have any assurace that I would. As well when i went out of work it was not feasible to pay for tuition etc. I am not willing to return to work untime my dad is gone. There have been a couple times when he has fallen and i was here for him. Granted most of the time he is in his chair watching cable, i hold my breath every day that he is there when i wake up and that nothing serious happens. I know we all go one day and he will be gone. I need a better chance to find a job, retail mgt I never want to do again. Anyway, sorry if I spilled my guts on you. I still love 3d tho hardly get time for it anymore.
---
Thanks! I'm somewhat familiar with macros since they were so important in vanilla, but I was confused by this one counteracting itself. I didn't take the order of operations into account.

Hahahahaha this made me laugh

2v2 is arena, not battlegrounds.  And battle grounds are phase 3, not phase 2.

You cant shadowmeld in combat. Human is the best rogue.

They are the second best tanks in classic. Warrior being the first obviously. And feral can do pretty good dps.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion on this sub, but I think classic could use some improvements. I enjoy the game a lot, and so far I have more fun in it than I do in retail, but sometimes I ask myself what they were thinking in 2004 when making the game. I'm all for no changes, because its how the game is supposed to be, but the game isn't perfect.

More of an embarrasing upgrade from a grey chain mail to Robe of the Moccasin from WC. Stats &gt; looks while levelling!

I read your post and thought .. you can play sims 3 in Warcraft?

Same boat - I’d started in late Cataclysm but didn’t hit level cap until mists. From all the negative stuff I’d heard about classic I went in with pretty low expectations, how I was spoiled, vanilla was SO HARD etc. 
---
So far I’m absolutely loving it. The zones are reinvigorated. I’m a Spriest again. It feels like an RPG. My guild is super active. I ran all the way to Shadowfang Keep from the Wetlands. The zone chat channels are always filed with people sharing info or asking questions.
---
Feels like Azeroth as it was meant to be.
---
Warrior's Protection branch is basically the weakest branch in the entire game for PvE. They had to buff it earlier in Vanilla because even end-game tanks werent using it, and as the years have gone on, private server players have revealed it's *still* not fully needed at end game.
---
Also, unfortunately, Warriors will never handle any mobs over 2 while leveling. Even just 2 mobs is a death sentence to most classes in Vanilla. Unless you have a healer, but even then over 2 is still usually too risky.
---
He made all the right moves, imo. He tried to get the guy to join, the guy declined. To me, he held up his end of "doing the right thing". Random guy had the chance and didn't take.

Higher damage = larger crits with mortal strike

I remember on my mage back in the day, mages used the decursive or decurse addon. It was called something like that, and all it did was put little squares under your map you could right or left click to cleanse the target that showed it needed cleansed. It's pretty simple and not too distracting.
---
Would have been better had it ended with "Love," instead of "From,".
---
You are absolutely right. By the time someone gets to 58-60 I hope they would have figured it out that some of the class builds are going to be rolling for stats/effects over the material of armor piece.
---
Me and a friend of mine pull 3-4 rather often.  We are a warrior priest combo though so it's not to hard to keep him topped off.  :)

Wowhead has a classic page that you can sort all the quests by whichever reputation it gives and itll show you which zone the quests are in. I can't be too much help as I dont play horde and dont knownthe quests all that well

Imagine honestly believing this.
---
We've been 4-manning dungeons with 2 underleveled people and only a boar pet for a tank.

I genuinely have to laugh at people spamming for a tank for WC for like 30 minutes. Just walk in and vaporise everything you see.

I also like healing.  It's almost like I have an inner narcissistic motivation driving me to keep people alive so that they know I am the one that kept them alive.   Lmao
---
Usually within the last two ticks for similar level mobs. I put it last so that my mana starts regenerating sooner, otherwise I have to wait 1.5s for GCD then another 1.5s to cast Mind Blast. The difference is probably negligible though tbh.
---
That's even better. One of the original lesbian flags has an axe on it.

If the person has the item already, the game pretends they don't exist.  I had a weapon that was unique drop a second time, I was able to see it on the corpse, but it did not say I passed more give me the option to need/greed

Ohh well shit good to know

Forgot about corpsemaker. Thanks
---
There are character transfers coming for select full realms to select low pop realms, so probably doesn't apply to your situation.
---
In terms of open paid transfers Willy nilly, I think the voice of the players is against that as it makes server communities less meaning full, as well as ninjas can server hop, as well as increased pops on full realms, as well as people taking easy Street to level to 60 then transferring to a pvp server, negating the effort it takes to level with wpvp, as well as it creates a precident for QoL changes that can open the door to a vast array of changes/additions/concessions that would hurt the game for what it is currently. 
---
Take what I say for a grain of salt, as I don't know what blizzard discusses, but if they are staying true to #nochanges then I think we won't see server transfers for a while. But if you and your buddy can both transfer from your current server s to one of the new ones opening up, it could work, I'm assuming you want to play with a friend.
---
I believe it’s like an auto attack or swing. You can jump or move but if the it interrupts the “swing” you still have to wait for the “wand swing to complete” before using a spell. Like a emergency heal in a dungeon can be delayed because of wand attack timer so just be careful when you wand

Wow, a full 5 lotus... How ever will the econ recovery from this massive influx of high end  materials?
---
&gt; Hunters need mana just like mages do
---
No, no they don't.
---
Mages have talents that leverage their intellect (shocker), and they gain spell crit from intellect.  **Hunters do not crit based on intellect.**
---
More importantly, mages don't have pets and strong auto-attacks to augment their damage -- they're 100% reliant on intellect/mana in order to keep dishing out damage.
---
What do hunters get?  At best, a few extra shots.  And those shots aren't even their sole source of damage.
---
This would make my day.
---
You're practically half way to 60.. Get to 60 and then make a mage. Problem solved.
---
Theres an add-on ElvUI took inspiration from that uses those name plates, if that's what you're after.
---
Otherwise there's XPerl for just the unit frames.
---
Interestingly I've never *not* played a rogue. In vanilla way back when and then now.
---
You must've missed the "in one hour" part
---
Reread again lmfao
---
You can use first aid while in combat meaning that as a pally you can bubble and then use a bandage when low on mana, or freeze and blink away as a mage to heal as well.
---
Did you notice if it dropped off a crimson whelp? I went there on my hunter, same level as you, and there were only like 3 crimson whelps, and then mostly (i think) lost whelps. Wowhead says only the crimson whelps drop it. I was waiting for respawns forever. It was super exp inefficient. Does it sound like I was doing something wrong or did it drop from a lost whelp for you?
---
yo how do we get our faction and class by our name?
---
So from this as a 24 lock atm its not really worth swapping till the 30s as the wand will be better? and how does this fare in dungeons as dps? or do you just get swap to the usual dots and bolt?
---
He’s trolling you.

I feel like stuff like that has been happening to me in every new zone i go to i find 4 or 5 people and just shoot the breeze on my mage ( without be a vending machine).

Rogue is not the best pvp class.  At high gear levels they are at a disadvantage against most other classes assuming equal gear/skill.

I suppose this wouldn't be a good time to mention that as soon as I dinged lvl 23, I ran to his spawn location and got him in less than 45 mins? :3c  
---
GRATS , he's a lovely boy.
---
Exactly.
---
By stating/requesting the loot rules in a party, you are making an agreement.
---
Ninja looting isn’t against TOS, but “scamming” is, and breaking laid out loot rules is considered to be scamming.
---
Its a “work-around” brought up by a few blue posts on the official forums, which I found after I was corrected about ninja-looting (I remembered people getting in trouble for ninja looting, but didn’t realize it was for “master loot” swapping, the literal ONLY “ninja-looting” scenario the GMs will deal with)
---
Went looking for information to educate myself on the topic, and posted what I found to help other people out.
---
You can’t get items back from a ninja-looter, but you can get them back from a “scam”. Protect yourself, lay out the loot rules, and then you avoid misunderstandings, and get assurance that if something like a BoE drops and you wanted to roll based on “need if its an upgrade” you know before hand that everyone is on the same page, and if they decide they want a cash out and break your set loot rules, then a GM can intervene and you aren’t just screwed.
---
typo!
---
The opposite happened to our group.  We were waiting for the stupid boar in Redridge, and some solo player comes up and states that it is his spawn.
---
We try to invite him to the group we have going, but he declines.  Says he's not grouping, it's his spawn, etc.  Basically being a dick.
---
So we have players come up ready to do the boar, so we invite them, have a full 5 man going, and we easily out tag the solo guy, who proceeds to rage.  After we kill it, the Night Elf Warrior says says this to the guy.
---
https://i.imgur.com/fY5swdJ.png
---
It was fantastic, just a rebuking lecture on attitude.  Poor guy had to be upset.
---
I mean I’m not doing it maliciously. If someone actually typed and asked for help I’d gladly help them, I’m not going to just accept any old group invite that’s to my detriment. 
---
Also I’m not using AoE in any situation where I can’t kite mobs and deal with the Aggro myself. That’s just bad practice.
---
You group up to finish a mission together. Friends or strangers, you're in it together.
---
Taking someone into the group and then ditching them last second because someone else tagged the mob is a very douchy move.
---
It's like making a promise and then not keeping it just because you can score a quicker victory elsewhere. It's selfish and screws over the person you agreed to cooperate with.
---

Its probably about the same as Bloodsail, "people are taking their time enjoying the game and RP will start increasing once people level up their characters and professions." As said earlier today in trade chat.
---
Humar the Pridelord, 8-12 hour lvl 23 rare spawn that pops up in the shade of a tree near Ratchet perfectly circled by lions.

Weapon skills are not really a pick and choose kind of thing, train swords and axes. It's all about which has better stats.
---
you're probably right. problem is I see it with my own 2 eyes
---
Couldn't I just use a potion?
---
I don't know, I really don't mind warrior all that much. I mean, it can get kind of slow and could inconvenient at times but I really love all the gear, weapons, rotations, etc.
---
  
---
Actually, druid is definitely #1 on my mind!! I really want to try a tauren druid. I just like this server a lot, and don't want to go through the hassle of removing my ally toon or transferring him to make room for the tauren. I'd like to transfer the warrior to a high pop ally realm and make my tauren on herod. Really wish we had server transfers.
---
RIP my man. If I had made such a catastrophic error I would just reroll a new character on your original server.

It is easy to charge completely with heavy armor into a group of enemies.

And if you knew what you were doing and where to go, you too could have get 5 lotus in an hour on vanilla.  This is exploiting the game, sure.  But that's substantially less than what people were claiming three days ago.

Yes.

Should be able to use it just fine with fun or bow. Maybe wrong ammo?

If you do choose a PvP server you won't be missing out on any PvE content, anything related to PvE is accessible on any type of server. The only real difference between the two is that on a PvP server you have the option to fight the enemy faction if you encounter them in the open world. In a PvE server the inter-faction combat is limited to battlegrounds.
---
World PvE involves grouping up with players to go fight a strong open world boss, of which there are several spread throughout Azeroth. So instead of getting your own private instance you are in the open world teaming up with other players to defeat very powerful creatures. It's not a huge part of the game but there will be opportunities to fight strong creatures in the open world.

Except he can do this for the next 2 weeks straight consistantly
---
Same thing happened to me! I got this bugger on my first Orc Hunter ages ago, remember logging in daily to see if he was there for a week before finally getting him. This time around? I only hung around for a little bit before he popped up while I was trying to find a working sound making target macro!
---
I've been on this realm since day one. I can say that people ARE willing to roleplay, and generally excites about it, but most people are focused on leveling, and I haven't seen any hardcore roleplay beyond choosing your words carefully. Its a great server! Many people chose it because it has no queue though and their not interested in RP, but if assume the same for the other RP realms.
---
It's not being petty, it's being instructive.  Hopefully that was a learning experience.
---
I tanked BFD as a walock last night definitely the quickest run I've done having 4 dps. Anything can tank at low levels.
---
My nipples hurt when i twist them
---
You forgot the /s
---
if you don't agree before you run the dungeon that's your own fault
---
I thought that was against the rules
---
I play on a PvP server, but in friendly areas we aren't flagged unless we do it manually or attack someone else.
---
I got stranded between south shore and menethil when I was flying and got disconnected.
---
No point in taking shadow priest into raids? Locks get a huge buff from shadow priests as there is no longer the 8 debuff cap.
---
Warlock is also my cup of tea
---
I’m so happy to not see bfa in that line up
---
Misdirection is TBC tho, no?
---
Yeah. Definitely overreacting here.
---
This has been proven to be only a medium speed leveling strategy.
---
Warlock no question
---
Well, it is a *roleplaying* game, and if there's any class to "roleplay" being a dick it's rogue.
---
I had a Paladin tank with a two handed weapon in sm last night. He was at level for the dungeon. I had no problems healing him
---
He didn’t see the breath bar?
---
WoWhead didn't even exist though, so it was a lot harder.
---
Many people in the comments have already said what I would say but I just needed to add: Your heals are definitely NOT unwanted lol
---
Lvl 28 mage here. I'm starting to understand how awesome this whole aoe grinding thing can be, but my main problem/question is, how do I pull the mobs initially?
---
I'm going in an wanding them or just running by them, but often they get me down to 30-40% health before I can frost nova all of them and then blink away. I don't seem to have time to get more than like 4 guys because of the time I have to get wailed on before they get clumped up.
---
Well? Did you?
---
Nice. Okay thanks!
---
Adrenaline rush+ blade flurry + evasion.
---
OK, but what if I'm crafting multiple items?
---
Yeesh. China is getting desperate.
---
First time playing wow since literally vanilla, and I never went past 40 as a hunter. Doing a rouge class now, what’s the BIS for weapon as a lv 60? Currently playing swords/daggers
---
There are a lot more meh epics than good ones.
---
Another thing I've learned: if you already have the addon and have to update, just overwrite the addon and do a /reload and things work just fine apparently
---
Nah you can get them used. I almost nabbed one for 50 bucks the other day but someone snagged it before I could get to it.
---
How did you get this picture of me?
---
What about a 40+ guild?
---
But don’t you sometimes want to use lower ranks on certain spells?  I swear I’ve heard that before.
---
Either it`s a scam or u just exposed his name lol
---
Do you?
---
*cries in low level warrior
---
Hahaha, love it.
---
I'm contested zones yes. Not in purely alliance it horde zones
---
I wonder what Gonnarhea's wife is sick wiith :(
---
Id like to know how is mage aoe leveling so fast? Its either one dude break away from aoe and messes it all up or im nearly dead after encounter and have to sit for another 30 sec to drink mana.
---
It won’t let me equip sword/sword is there a specific type of sword?
---
You're not going to have a good time grouping for uncommon drop quests, I've heard stories about people grouping up for some in Barrens and it taking them all an hour to do.
---
I can not fucking wait until AB comes out just for this very reason. You bet your ass imma be camping that cap and just running people off that cliff over and over.
---
What chat add-on shows the race and class?
---
On Skeram we have a guild name &lt;SKERAM RANCH&gt;
---
Hahaha just ruffling some feathers, don’t mind me.
---
Hell no. I took a copy though 😂 with a name like that no way it’s real.
---
I wonder if theres an optimal number of people for Loot Item quests. Clearly its better to be in a group for a Kill quest, but when you're sharing low chance loot, maybe fewer is better?
---
Have to be in your party to cast Dampen/Amplify magic on you/pet anyways which usually isn't conductive to driveby buffing.
---
I don't remember having any epics in TBC when I started Kara, and I don't think we had the at the start of Naxx either.
---
I like how much youtube and the like have changed the legacy of this weapon. In classic, you knew someone with a Ravager sucked. Not people look at it like, "omg, this was such a sleeper."
---
It was not. The reason it only gained a legacy after it stopped being available is the effect looks cool, but it hinders you more than it helps.
---
With elvui you can have more than 9 bars
---
Brought an irl friend with me to play wow and he hadn't realised what need/greed is for either.
---
It sounds like you would want to find a camp where there are already 4 or 5 mobs sitting together.
---
I would be excluded, unfortunately
---
PepeHands
---
Quest helper. Tomtom.
---
I mean isn't the DPS on daggers technically mostly the same as swords? I'm looking at atlasloot right now and the equivalent level sword/dagger's typically have the same amount of dps on them.
---
Yeah it's a bit baffling that people seem to think rend is worthless. Rend is worthless at end game, because it's usefulness falls off super hard since it doesn't scale. While in early levelling, it's one of your highest DPS to Rage point abilities.
---
Sometimes the truth is that simple.
---
10.
---
/bt, click each bar, click each and enable, then check the visibility tab for each one.
---
Its consistent.  Everything else is gear dependent.  It's fine to use other things when you have them.  In the real world you dont always get corpsmaker on your first RFK run for the WF luls.  I suppose rockbiter could be consistent to on low armor stuff.
---
That's not an excuse to make a post with shit pic in 2019. Do your job properly or do not do it at all.
---
I love when I can get a great random demon name.  This time around I got Tarpit, the imp and Jhaamon, the fel puppy.
---
I feel like people telling stories like this were why pservers got some quest dorp rates so horribly wrong. Like the trolls of STV-- I think I grinded from 40-41 solely while doing one of the tusks quest on a pserver, but on classic the drop rate was like literally 20x higher.
---
Dude, calm down.  
---
You know they will progress „classic“ in a way if the demand remains high.  
---
While I would like to see a different path, going BC can work with pvp if they actually work around avoiding pvp with skills to pull fly mounts down or anything other.  
---
While I agree flying mounts ruined a substantial part it is no reason to flip like you did
---
They’re gonna love it when layering is gone.
---
Any guilds on Myzrael I could join? Lvl 24 Hunter looking for ppl to dungeons with, the world is constantly dead 😕
---
"Blizzard Construction Co"
---
For context, I’ve leveled around 10 warriors to 60 over the years, and am playing a Tauren Druid as my main right now and absolutely LOVING it.  It’s staggering how much more fun it is.  I’d strongly suggest giving it a shot.  I’m on Skeram Horde and it’s great. Super high pop and horde every where.  Think I’ve died to one alliance rogue once the entire way so far and I’m level 35.  Killed around 30 or 40 alliance.
---
"Sorry we're full" is the equivalent to saying "Sorry, I don't have any change" to a beggar.
---
/s What Blizz/WoW staff member did you enrage, lol.
---
They are on my server. Had recently a group with 3 other rogues
---
holy fuck on launch day my fingers were dying from spamming my macro why didn't I put it on mouse scroll you're so smart
---
Is the picture, in any way, shape or form, unclear? Go to specsavers is it is
---
In contested areas.
---
For efficiency ita best to level one.
---
For fun though level as many as you want. Until you get sick of doing the starter areas lol.
---
Im leveling 2 right now. 31 warrior and 17 priest. And thinking about leveling a third. Druid shamny or mage. Or maybe all of them lol!
---
Rogue of 15 years here, with a lot of time in vanilla. Here's some general tips for you from my own playstyle, which is **not** aimed at levelling as fast as possible, but having fun with the class, enjoying stealth, being useful to my group etc. I recommend my approach as it's way more fun, but there's a *ton* of guides out there if you want to just minmax it to 60 so just follow one of those if you're interested in that.
---
I'm also not going to really address end game.. that's something to look at when you get there. Until then I recommend you just explore the class and have fun, learn your abilities and what works/doesn't. The meta for rogues has changed a bunch over the expansions but if you fully understand the class you'll never have an issue always being the best you can be.
---
**General tips**
---
* Early on it's just spamming Sinister Strike and Evis. Simple stuff. 
---
* Learn cooking and first aid as soon as you can, and keep them levelled.
---
* Your first 10 points should be in Sub, max out Camouflage. This makes stealth actually bearable while levelling, even if you will probably spec out of this late game (I recommend dropping it as soon as you learn your last level of stealth at 60 so you don't get too used to it). I personally don't bother with Master of Deception and take Opportunity instead, but you might want to put 2 points in there or so if you're finding yourself getting spotted a lot. 
---
* If you're planning to group a lot with PuGs, consider taking going down Sub and taking Improved Sap over going a high damage combat build out the gate. I've seen many more groups wipe to poor aggro control and lack of CC than not having enough DPS, which if you know what you're doing you'll still be putting out a ton of. This is vanilla.. CC and aggro control matter.
---
* **LEARN TO USE YOUR TOOLS, ESPECIALLY STEALTH**. That means understanding how mobs will react to you, at what distances, etc. You can do a lot to help your group by scouting, distracting, sapping, and otherwise being a sneaky rogue. A good rogue can help you take down things that would otherwise be out of your level range.
---
* Do your poisons quest as soon as possible and make sure you level them up. Poisons in Vanilla work like your own version of alchemy. If you don't make a bunch of level the skill up then you won't learn the new ranks of poisons.
---
* Speaking of poisons, use them all! If mobs tend to run, crippling is your friend. Healing caster boss? Wound and Mind-Numbing help so much more than a little extra DPS. 
---
* Pickpocket! You will get extra cash, blinding powder (expensive to make or buy), poison reagents, trash items, healing potions, you name it. Seriously, pickpocket is your friend and only takes a second. Let your tank get aggro while you steal shit and everybody wins.
---
* Level your lockpicking every level or two. It's no big deal but it gets real tedious real fast if you need to get 50 levels at a time.. you increase by 5 every time you ding, just go take a minute to sort that out.
---
* Kick! Kick is amazing. Use it liberally on anything that wants to heal itself or ruin your day.
---
**Actually killing shit tips**
---
* You have a throwing knife. Use it early levels to stop your mobs getting tagged by ranged classes.
---
* You do not have a mana pool, you have an energy pool.. that means so long as your energy isn't at 100, you aren't wasting damage. If you plan to gouge or otherwise stun an enemy, wait till you have 80 energy or so.. that way you can actually follow up with an attack instead of standing there looking at them funny.
---
* Opening with Cheap Shot and using Kidney Shot instead of evis might seem like a slower option than just pure damage, but you'll *take* less damage and can just go from mob to mob to mob with a quick bandage here and there. This varies by mob type, some can be just burst down before they can do anything to you. Try different ways to killing things.. if nothing else you'll learn all your abilities and how they work for you, which is just as important as going "ding" in my view.
---
* On the other hand, if you've taken a few points in Improved Ambush and Opportunity you can often put a mob down to almost no health in seconds. 
---
**In groups/dungeons**
---
* **YOUR DPS DOES NOT MATTER IF THE GROUP WIPES.** Focus on the marked target, don't pull aggro. This is obviously true for all classes but vanilla rogues often struggled with this in groups. 
---
* An interrupt will often do more for the group than anything else. Don't let your healer get mana burned, don't let mobs heal one another. You can do all of this and still put out great damage, but if *nobody* does it then your damage isn't going to matter unless you only do stuff you out level and out gear.. and where's the fun in that?
---
* Learn to CC. Work with your tank to sap things, when you learn Blind you can use that to stop an add from ruining your day, things like that. Be more than just a stabbing robot, look around you and keep track of what's happening and see where you can help. A Vanish/Cheap Shot on the add that just appeared out of nowhere and is fucking up your healer can give the tank those few seconds they need to get things under control. 15 seconds of Evasion tanking has gotten my raids kills that would otherwise have been 1% wipes. 
---
* Learn to manage your aggro. This matters in classic! Feint should be used when needed and vanish is an amazing aggro dump, it's not just for running away in a wipe.
---
**Actual dungeon mobs**
---
* If trash is dying so fast you can't build combo points... don't stress. It doesn't matter, shits dead.
---
* Slice and Dice will do more for your damage than anything else. Your first priority is to get behind the mob and get that up. If there's a bunch of adds you can use the first to build combo points, pop slice and dice before it dies and then use that on the rest.
---
Anyway, hope there's some useful tips in there. Playing a rogue is pretty simple, but if you take the time to really learn what they can be used for they're a really versatile and useful class. I can't tell you the number of times I've had groups be amazed they have a rogue who was interested in anything other than maxing DPS metres and pissing off the tank.
---
Enjoy!
---
Train sunder, and revenge.  Use them.  Use a shield.  Use shield block.  Use revenge whenever it's up.  Tank in fucking defensive stance.  The last one is important because yoy have something like 50% more threat.  (130% modifier instead of 80%).
---
If I get one more god damn tank that thinks it's cool to tank in battle or berserker stance...
---
I tried farming it for 30 mins one day and never saw it.
---
Why are you 'helping out' on a PvP server? You know they are obligated to attack you right?
---
That’s absurd
---
I disagree. I will not join groups like that. Since launch i have not seen one case of this happening on my server.
---
Utility?? What is this battle for Azeroth?
---
Can't wait to get Eyes of the Beast so I can run around Old Ironforge with my pet again
---
Are you logging out or getting DCed/timing out? They won't save if you are DCing or timing out.
---
Wetlands!
---
Ninja to avoid ninjas... got it...
---
Laughs in mage
---
Poor hunters.
---
It's beautiful, I wish I had one for my girlfriend so she'll always get home :)
---
Thank you guys so much, I guess i was just too used to solo questing, I’ll just focus on just healing for now. I really appreciate it :D
---
Because you pull aggro off of the tank, causing the healer to have to bubble you or heal you which pulls aggro to the healer. On top of all that, locks life tap, so it can be hard to tell if they got aggro sometimes.
---
Basically, dot the main target and spam shadowbolt. If you see the warrior get sunder-stacks, then dot the sundered mob
---
It depends on the content and your +heal gear.  The more +heal gear the more you can downrank to get the numbers you want vs the mana cost.  There is no definitive use rank 8 and rank 2 type rule.  It depends on the content, group and your gear.  I would generally use your biggest heal and a down rank of 50-60% of it, renew and flash heal, maybe lesser heal max rank for between pulls or casters.
---
HA
---
I farmed about 50g here in my early 30s to save towards my mount. It's not the fastest Level 40 mount gold farming method out there, and rewards no exp while doing it, but it is reliable. No dependency on the server economy.
---
Also found a few Big Iron Fishing poles which are worth selling in the neutral AH. It's the best fishing rod Alliance can get (Horde can get a quest reward from The Hinterlands), until the Arcanite one from winning the STV fishing contest.
---
I believe sometime in TBC, or perhaps in the TBC pre-patch, they nerfed this to give 55 copper instead.
---
While it was a solid and reliable gold making method at that level, it's not much use after 40. You will easily gain more gold from questing or generic mob/resource farming at that point.
---
Dwarves can use a metal chicken though so really why bother?
---
Oh I remember that!! Posting here to keepupdated on if anyone has a link.
---
As a warlock..... muahahhahhahahaha!!!
---
Not really.  It doesn't really effect me much and it's not that big a. Issue
---
I feel like I just became a whole new class with Blade Flurry. Goddamn this is fun.
---
&lt;3
---
Prowl is a lvl 30 ability. Humar is coveted due to being the only lion with that skin in the game. Bonus points for having a 1.3 attack speed.
---
8% bf wtf. I was at 12% but popped to 18%. Alternative day fasting would be too much.
---
I look fairly muscular but am sick of this minigut.
---
Hydraxion Waterlords - EU?
---
I've played with Pureheart before lol
---
Is there an addon (or a way to do it natively) that compares highlighted items with what’s currently equipped? Similar to Diablo?
---
Guess you could, in my experience I get more cloth drops to make into bandaids than I get health pots
---
It was in Vanilla.  You have to get it from [traps](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6367/big-iron-fishing-pole#comments).  There are comments from 1.2, so it should be there.
---
thank you guys
---
Currently at 41, and I hate STV.
---
Someone send help please
---
I was waiting for a mob to spawn and a warrior walked up. I invited him and he declined. I tagged the mob first and then again tried inviting him, he declined. After I killed the mob he whispered me "fuck you". 
---
I was so god damn confused.
---
Bats in uldaman are pretty good and Scorpids and a few other critters.
---
I love BIGGLESWORTH I'm alliance. Lots of people helping each other and so forth. I'm not even in a guild or nothing just am meeting lots of great people as I level.
---
No
---
When you’re in the process of completing multiple quests in an area of the map, is it better to hearth back to the zones inn before logging for the day / night and have to walk back to the area when you log back in, or just log in a safe place and immediately start where you left off without having to walk back?  Just thinking what’s the most effective time wise.
---
Where is this "shit pic" you are raging about? I'm not sure if you're trolling or if you're actually that petty.
---
This is the easiest money blizzard has ever made. They didn't do this out of the kindness of their hearts it's a 100% cynical cash grab.
---
It honestly makes you feel more like a warlock when you like the names of your demons
---
Everything is super cheap right now because there's so little money in the economy. Money comes into existence in this game via vendors and mob drops and quest rewards, and right now there's just less money to go around because so few people have done high level quests and there hasn't been a whole lot of vendoring or killing high-level mobs.
---
Also, just talking about supply and demand, there's a glut of low-level crafting ingredients because so many people are leveling and very little demand for most items because people are trying to save money for skills and mounts and such, so that's driving prices down. That'll change when more people hit 60 and start doing endgame dungeons and raiding and, eventually, BGs.
---
These days, the latter is quite often true for people in some places though.
---
No-one under the age of 30 I know IRL carries cash.
---
Axes have...wait for it...blades it's the long sharp edge you see. So.e even have two
---
No... they just threw it in because they had to quickly put together the ability to transfer, and they are just using the retail shop interface. No need to panic over it.
---
I would have done the same...
---
Gotta love the cruel barb.
---
2 more levels until the upgrade!
---
Good man, definitely useful. What’s more those pots will have more value in P2 with pvp
---
You don’t sit down until your character is registered as being afk, he probably left his gnome standing.
---
Taking a swing at this... My first weakaura I've ever made so may be buggy.

There are so many good 2h axes leveling up that you should keep up on that skill more than others till 60
---
Up voted for BIGGLESWORTH 
---
but /taunt for the faction. Heh.
---
Free actions are more useful in PvP so I expect they will return to value in phase 2 and even further in phase 3 with the introduction of warsong gulch.
---
Nah.  That quest is in Redridge, not Westfall.  
---
The lowest level quest in Duskwood is 18.
---
you're a fairly decent leveling class that falls off hard endgame
---
Those look overly expensive for some walmart looking chairs.  What makes them special?
---
I think you need to run a scan of the auction house with it to get the DEing price. The addon just tells you based off the most previous prices it found for the mats it will likely give.
---
I did that too :D
---
What would be the best counter against warlock?
---
So it seems Ricardo is playing WoW now...
---
Sure!
---
Lok tar ogar my zug
---
That quest is in redridge and it isn't a level 10 quest anyway...
---
There is not a hard counter.
---
Can you explain why this is better at times than W ?
---
I've found when you kill a named creature for a quest drop, the drop can be looted by everyone in your party
---
What if I told you it's about the same level of childish bullshit as 14 years ago
---
I have a macro for this very thing. I have never not been first to tag the mob.
---
I don't think I bothered until SM - at which point Heal (Rank 1) became my bread and butter. Around 36-38 this became Heal (Rank 2) so it would have some more umph.
---
Oh shit heal would be max rank, until 40 - at which point you get greater heal. Lesser heal can spot heal okay on lower health groupies like Mages and Rogues if they catch minor trouble. 
---
Renew isn't efficient, so don't use it. Shield is mana heavy - so it's mostly used in absolute emergencies, or if you are running spell cleave and want to protect a mage who is blizzarding from pushback. 
---
I haven't messed with down ranking shield yet, it might be worthwhile but meh.
---
If you got super lucky you could've gone to Kara with few epics from the end bosses of HC Dungeons, but the same can easily be said of Vanilla, most of the endgame dungeons drop an epic or two.
---
Back in Vanilla I levelled there and then went up North and finished up in the Plaguelands. God exorcism feels good to cast.
---
Sounds like you wasted your time bruddaaaaa. They'll be worth more once more people start hitting 60 and raking in gold.
---
Why? Because it’s your choice to buy something or because of some other reason? Or are you just being dramatic to try to get karma?
---
&gt;Clicking need should auto-bind that item to your character IMO.
---
it does that in retail. it's a good idea. but ultimately not needed as long as everyone knows that you hit Need on BoEs
---
I went from retail leveling to classic leveling (as a noob) and I finally now understand why people got addicted to this game. I am thoroughly loving the difficulty and the increased focus you need to fight more than 1 mob.
---
They said in a interview with Tipsout that they only say to do character transfers would be through the new way and not bring back the old way of doing it.
---
yes, yes you were the healer :)
---
Leggings of the fang?
---
so I should just buy them now and sell them in phase 2?
---
Omg! People using in game mechanics to get a leg up on people. Burn his ass! Throw him under the bus! Off with his head! ECT...
---
Barrens is a horde zone afaik, alliance automatically get tagged and Horde are only tagged if they choose to be or if they attack an alliance character. For PvP head north to ashenvale or south to 1k needles (shimmering flats is great).
---
My lock spells were like 54s at lvl 30 are the prices different for each class wtf?
---
I feel like it would be better to hearth so that you can get some rested xp from logging out in an Inn.
---
Yes, we need WoW 2
---
Depends on when you plan on logging back in. Hearthing back to an inn or major city will give you rested Xp.  So if you plan on being logged off for a day or two I’d definitely head back to a rested xp area.  If your just gonna log off for a few hours I’d go with the travel efficiency.
---
then u need a big amount of warlocks to make use of that buff when u could just bring mages instead that do more dps and do less threat. in the end its a matter of how much u care and are willing to bring meme specs into your raid when u could size it down to a smaller size and get more loot per person and 1 wl for COE and taking the wl set items. SP is a meme spec in pve
---
It was really satisfying ninja tagging Mokk in STV when a group of two refused to invite me :)
---
If one person can do it, everyone can. This is why exploits are called exploits.
---
I'm not trying to sound elitist, or argue about this. Everything you say is wrong. CA has the highest weapon damage, and the highest DPS, along with one of the most preferred stats stacking for arms. The only other 2h that competes with CA in terms of viability in PvP and damage in PvE for arms warrior is the axe that drops from Cthun. -25 stam had absolutely no impact. That's 250 health scaling. Litteraly nothing for arms and could easily be mitigated by enchants for stam which you should already have. Corrupted Ashbringer is 100% a warrior weapon, and the best of them in the class of 2handers. Ret pali could indeed benefit from it too, but no where near as much as arms did
---
This. Had an oh shit moment today when I handled 3/4 and the 5th is the one that got me. Then I realized that was better than I'd ever done and it felt easy
---
I used to play in Vanilla with a guy like this in my guild.  I had a weird feeling about him when we were low levels but couldn't put my finger on it so I'd group and quest with him and whatnot anyway when he was in the same zone as I was in.
---
Eventually after enough examples it became clear.  The guy was a just a bonafide born asshole.  Some people are just made differently and there's nothing you can do to get through to them it's not in their blood.  Met more than my fair share of jokers like this in my 15 years in the game and I'm just glad we're separated by a monitor and large distances because I'd want some of these guys nowhere near myself or anyone I know.  Absolute complete lack of scruples haha!
---
press the button to get rid of layering, dynamic spawns, and remove everyone's memory of the mechanics so we all get a fresh start.
---
It's not yours until its in your bags.
---
Pfff. Beacuse i am playing classic because i want the classic experience. I want to play the game as it used to be when i played it 13 years ago.
---
&lt;Bear looking at the discussion with a tear in it’s  eye&gt;
---
It’s obviously not. It happens for people in party, or obviously in your layer with you. It’s just a by product of retails cross realm designations.
---
You must be horde
---
Found the Hunter.
---
Enjoy it my man. And go drink some water now, so your hangover is a bit better and you can fuckin kill WoW all day tomorrow too.
---
Pretty much, yeah. I was looking for reddit to be my wow mom and tell me that I either did a naughty or was a good boy because I have severe self confidence issues and require the validation from reddit because people in real life wont give it to me.
---
#JustGnomeThings
---
You can't compare it. Druids are versatile and can play any role, just not as well. By end game they're a support class. You won't really see a bear as main tank in a 40 man, but perhaps as off tank. They're excellent support healers and they're absolutely needed for battle rez. They're my 2nd favorite class besides Mage. I played both Druid and Mage way, way back in the day. Overall Druid is my favorite for solo questing and leveling. They're fine but don't except to be main healer, tank, or dps in a 40 man raid, purely a support role end game. However, that doesn't mean you can't tank or heal a 5 man, you can no problem.
---
On Pagle as well and having a total different experience - need a guild inv?
---
You don't have to be a dick about it...
---
If they added the cash for gold system I'd quit too... Pay 2 win is not for retail.
---
if i decide not to do any dungeons while leveling and wait till 45 - 50 to start dungeon i will to be "less geared" a lot and not doing good in those dungeons ?
---
Ah okay, thanks for the clarification. Not gonna lie, it was a little triggering logging in and seeing a shop button at first lol.
---
How did you find this out?
---
I’d head to stranglethorn. But if your on a PvP server, and dislike world PvP, you may want to look elsewhere.
---
Skinning.
---
Or when you are looking around for an elite rare and someone doesnt invite you or just leaves group. Only to frantically become your best friend when you find it first
---
Facts or troll?
---
That's what a bunch of people in this thread are doing?
---
Windfury can proc itself and has no cd in classic iirc
---
Yeah vendor the food^^
---
Ya I can't say how many timea I've just invited people, we kill the NPC, then leave the group. Don't even say anything. Every group interaction doesn't have to be this long drawn out thing
---
You have to macro it but can do it safely without getting hit.  Cancel form, drink potion, back to bear.  All in one gcd and because of spell batching no chance you get hit while out of bear.
---
Point A is entirely dependent on class, and how you're leveling. If you're questing as a caster, then yeah, your gear is largely irrelevant. If you're mob grinding as a melee, then you're making more money and can afford to buy upgrades every 5 levels or so to keep your speed up.
---
As an Enh shaman, I've bought a weapon every 4-5 levels and it makes a huge difference in kill speed, and pays for itself quite quickly.
---
&gt; per say
---
per se*
---
Fuck this noise.
---
In game shops ruin games. It doesn't matter if I'm not using it when every fucking other player is driving around on a shitty motorbike mount or a dragon pet they have or wearing cosmetics that they bought.
---
It rips the heart and soul right out of the game and the second I see it, I'm gone.
---
Yet it wont take long for most of you to forget again. "It's just QoL bro, dude it doesn't affect you at all, just don't do it if you don't like it." *insert emotional argument* *censor the few big community names who care enough to speak out* *cite random pseuds about fallacies who got their phd in cultural subversion* *receive level 1 epic mount on new toons with buff that runs 50% faster when you're facing the direction of the nearest microtransaction vendor*  "wtf guys we need a new game, how did this happen"
---
I have a level 10 dwarf hunter, an 8 nelf druid, and a 5 nelf rogue. 
---
The dwarf I will be leveling alongside my husband's priest, and the druid I will be leveling solo when he's at work and the baby is napping. 
---
The rogue I am debating over still, so I got that one through the start zone and parked it in Dolanaar for now.
---
WoW
---
With a frictionless wheel...
---
General rule of thumb OP, ask. I'd say.. Not intentionally the asshole, but you pulled an asshole move. Reason being, the ring is of more benefit to someone else.. say, the healer. You can get technical and say "I use those stats, so nyah," but since you're asking here, you might not genuinely know. 
---
You've got a minute to roll for it, so just ask. "Hey, that has more X on it, mind if I roll on it?" That, and look at who all rolled on it. If no someone needed, ask them. If no one needed, then well- self explanatory. Just be aware in classic, you'll be labled ninja a lot easier for these type of situations. Not saying you are, or will be in these situations, just know that people judge /quick/.
---
Head to stonetalonmountain.... Lots of pvp...
---
Nice! I've been enjoying your art on the shaman discord.
---
There are 2 boats at wetlands. If you are looking out to sea it is on the right. Will take you to darkshore, if thats too low then walk to ashenvale from there.

Wait, you can sell letters on the AH??????

I'm so beyond confused. He's talking about shop items and you bring up the queue? I'm forever confused.
---
Yeah, I know, but I don’t mind keeping tailoring until then. Making bags and filling in my bad gear is nice
---
I just stopped reading when he said he won’t upgrade past rank 2.
---
I use Questie because I was essentially alt-tabbing to Thottbot most of the time anyway in Vanilla. Questie acts as my Thottbot.
---
Oh yeah I’m sure that just destroys everything you live for. And rapes your very soul. Jesus the melodrama in this post lol.

Do they even sell at such a low level? with this economy
---
I honestly feel like everyone except a very small few knows that switching realm almost never ever ever ends positively. Why do you think almost no one bothers? Anyway, sorry about your name. 
---
Back in vanilla, I had a similar issue, where a blizzard GM screwed me over on a restored character by changing the name and claiming the original name was being used by a new character (it wasnt, I managed to make a new level 1 with my original name to test) so I get it. Blizzard can be cruel and unfair, mainly because they are a multi million dollar corporation who does not give a shit about me or you.

I already use shift to run for other games. And I don't use shift for anything in this game so...it works well.
---
Nah man the only one here who needs help is obviously you. I wasn't the one who threw a tantrum at the mere mention of flying being in the game and then going off on someone for having the "wrong opinion" claiming I was a retard and a teenager. Even though its hilarious you feel the need to bad mouth kids like that. Really speaks to how small emotionally you are that you would act like at and then claim to be old enough to be someone's dad. 
---
Don't get butthurt and cry like a little bitch next time someone has a different opinion of you then has the balls to attack you back for being a huge miserable piece of shit. 
---
Maybe if you learn to let all that hate go then you won't have a heart attack in 2 years and die alone like you probably deserve. 
---
Any way, enjoy your miserable life cock sucker.
---
In the options you can enable extra action bars, but honestly it's just way easier to install an addon like dominos. 
---
When you have dominos installed, you have 10 bars visible. you can click the dominos icon and then there is a short instruction for how to deal with bars (making them visible or invisible), and you can instead shift click to unlock keybind mode. Then you hover over a key, hit escape to clear the binding, hit any key to bind it to that button, and then click cancel if you messed it up and bound your movement keys to action bars, or click okay if you did it right. 
---
If you pull threat as a healer, you run to the tank. He might not even see you are getting hit, and he does not want to turn his back to the pull (can'd block or parry from behind). If anyone is AOEing the pull, they will aoe your mob. By running to the tank, you maximixe the chance that someone who is not you will attract the mob's attention.
---
What. This has nothing to do with the post.
---
No he’s talking about something that isn’t even I. The game and that he will quit if it’s added regardless of what functions are within. And I’m confused with you.
---
What are you using shift to modify?
---
 it’s not a quest reward... it drops off Herod in SM armory.
---
Amazing
---
I am pretty sure that is the point when rend is not  good lol. Once you have mortal strike you also have whirlwind and you are able to kill mobs fast making rend even more inefficient.
---
A little late but just wanted to say this isn't true. I'm still surprised people don't understand layering.
---
Layering does in fact increase a servers max population. Each layer has roughly the same (maybe slightly less, Blizzard has never stated this) amount of players as 1 old wow server. So when a server is maxed out in a que (probably 5-8 layers) the server is actually housing anywhere from 2-8x more players (once again Blizzard hasn't given us numbers) then original vanilla wow.
---
That's the whole point of layering. Increase server capacity so when tourists leave you still have a healthy population. Also to reduce queue times.
---
Nice way to go.  Next try it with shamans. Good luck.
---
Neutral but it can get ugly if a fight breaks out.
---
Thanks, this was the one that the discord auto-filter somehow thought was 'explicit' haha.
---
I'm not sure about that. i did notice that I wasnt having issues getting new weapons as long as I was in a dungeon. Just used that time to skill up and it was pretty quick.
---
Frostbolt &gt; fireball &gt; fireball &gt; fire blast to finish  
---
Just spamming frostbolt is not efficient until at least lvl 30. Spend a little silver for faster kills.

Once you get the rhythm of the rotation down, you never run out of energy, and as long as you’re being healed you’re a dps machine. 
---
shaman, lock, mage. Priest, boomkin and even hunter in classic all need mana and going oom is a huge dps loss 
---
Warriors need rage against which is easier to regenerate than mana but you can still flat line. 
---
Feral Druid is similar to rogue and warrior resource but not as many abilities in cat or bear form compared to warrior or rogue. A druids toolkit extends out of catform / bear form, so mana is a small factor.
---
I'm glad you found a way that works using crafting professions, the way I suggested also works; they aren't mutually exclusive, it just depends on OP's preferred style of play. I prefer the gathering professions route so I can be making money while getting experience.

Here's a template. Mix it up as you see fit.

\#showtooltip Spell
---
/cast \[nomod\] Spell1; \[mod:Shift\] Spell2; \[mod:alt, @player\] Spell3; \[mod:ctrl, @mouseover, exists, harm, nodead\] Spell4; \[mod:ctrl\] Spell4
---
This gives you an idea of how to use the modifiers. Also, @player, @target, and @mouseover tell the spell where to be directed. exists, harm, help, and nodead are modifiers that can be added to macros so they don't try to cast on targets that aren't elligible.

What you call melodrama is literally the only thing that is going to keep this casino loot box/microtransactions stuff out of our games. If we all just have your attitude of "oh well"...

It was actually at the start of a run; and it was the priest he ask a tip from.

Blaumeux, bad name, but the horde to alliance ratio is nearly perfectly balanced making for great pvp to come
---
Not really
---
It was done back in original wow 😂
---
its called group loot. whites and greys are done on a round robin style of looting, anything green or higher goes to roll. If you are looting quest items, and it someone else loot but they dont need the quest item, you can loot it afterwards.
---
Unsure, but he clipped me being a bad boy
---
No thanks!
---
Depends. When in a group the group leader can change the way loot is distributed. If you are party leader, right click on your portrait and select loot option. It will tell you in game how each one works.

Literally this earlier today. I’m climbing up to the top, Ranger is killing Wyverns.

Me: “You need the escort quest?”

Whelpppp *walks over and talk to Tauren RIGHT as he spawns*

I don't disagree, and usually I will group up, but sometimes I am multi-task questing slowly and will go afk for a few minutes every few minutes to do something on my second monitor. I don't think people I'm grouped with would appreciate that so when I know I am engaged I'll refuse quest invites unless I'm ready to commit to finishing the quest before going back to my other thing.
---
I would say that is a vast minority of the time, but I love playing this game after work but I have many real life responsibilities.  At any moment the dog needs let in/out, garbage needs taken out, dinners on the table, you know....life stuff.  People get annoyed when I'm always going afk /follow.  but real life &gt; game so i just tend to solo.  sometimes I get to play for 2 hours non-stop, but because I do get called away so often and people don't like it, I simply avoiding grouping.
---
Like a glove
---
You don't understand economics very well. Getting the utility value without spending the money is equivalent to getting the money without getting the utility. Either way, it's a windfall - you got something you otherwise wouldn't have gotten, for free.but it's not a bigger windfall for the person who can use it. Either they got utility they otherwise wouldn't have gotten because they never would have paid market price for the item, OR they got to save money they otherwise would have paid for the utility they would have bought at market prices.
---
Yeah I never went to Winterspring until Legion in retail. I never hit max level in vanilla and once BC hit there was no reason to stick around and level in vanilla zones anymore. I finally went there while I was trying to get Loremaster

There’s no designated pvp areas released yet, and nowhere to find people leveling until you reach contested zones. You should naturally start seeing people in the world regularly around level 20-25. Ashen vale is good area to look to quest around level 20 for pvp.
---
They've also got Duskwood at level 10. Wut?
---
I’m asking for confirmation
---
Nice
---
rrm
---
Or one mob 2 levels higher than you..
---
But me hero go Heroic Strike SMOrk
---
I'm getting my hunter to 60 then making a mage alt. Hunter feels so satisfying to play right now.
---
Considering it's just using retail asset and systems.. no. Also paid character transfers are going to be a thing but only that.
---
What is the icon on the bottom left?
---
Probably outdated version of windows or you don't have snip and sketch installed.
---
Save it on a bank alt and sell it later ;)
---
Really good point that I havent seen brought up. It's kind of like a positive version of PTSD flashbacks Haha. Where the environment triggers something in you and you remember...Wow.. this is where xyz happened, how could I forget.. almost like flashbacks to a previous life
---
one of the first things i checked too
---
Oh okay, thanks. So I can’t do battleground or any of that stuff yet? I tried to talk to the battlemastwr about Warsong gulch but I couldn’t do anything.
---
&gt; If you are looting quest items, and it someone else loot but they dont need the quest item, you can loot it afterwards.
---
Not entirely. If there are quest items on a mob and you have that quest, you can loot it if your group killed it, doesn't matter who was supposed to be "next up" for loot. That's why in a lot of dungeons, the melee will get all their scales and such from mobs way before the mage or hunter.
---
White and gray non-quest items go in order around the group, but don't necessarily distribute evenly. After a mob dies, the game decides who was next up for loot, and they can get it. If they click the target and choose not to take it, then it's free for all.
---
I can confirm they are even though I'm not OP. Nothing else in the game looks like that
---
Is this a challenge
---
Is that how it works in classic? I was telling a new player that you don't need free for all loot when doing quests because each player will always see their own quest item drops
---
Well then I agree.
---
sw one is still there
---
Hard to tell you what you'll enjoy among 4 classes. I would probably recommend lock for you, it's a dps class that also provides a ton of support, which you mentioned you enjoy. 
---
I wouldn't recommend a class with a heal button because they really are relegated to healing in raids, and you want flexibility. This especially applies to shaman, because their dps spec has no unique buff and they do horrible dps in raids.
---
I think tanking is a ton of fun as well.
---
 I never played a Hunter.
---
What spells should I skip as an enhancement shaman?
---
There’s nothing really hidden about them. Your professions are solid as mining will feed your engineering and engineering won’t eat up your first aid cloth. Just make sure to dedicate time and effort to them as you level so they don’t fall behind.
---
I really like this about the classic community the salt levels have significantly decreased and it seems like people give a flying shit about others. Last night I made a level 43 priest night as I rode by as he was running. I asked him if he had his mount and he told me he was 2 gold away. I opened trade and asked do you have any cloth for trade. He trades me 5 linen,  I gave him the two gold for five linen. Why because people need to help eachother. I hope my kindness was paid forward.
---
I see, so for a warlock I wanna prioritize + shadow damage &gt; just stacking intellect
---
I thought about dropping alchemy for skinning but it seem kinda boring to only play for the money as it’s my first time playing. The idea of alchemy is fun to me, but the downside is that I doubt I’ll get my mount at 40.
---
Ooh, sounds fun. I'm gonna make some now.
---
It is harmless and fun. It's very easy to not die to this.
---
"You seem to be offended". Ironic.
---
As long as your not a gnome or a night elf I leave you alone.
---
Lol
---
Right, pick up quests are different, but don't usually revolve around 1 mob, and if they do, everyone in the group can get it too
---
YOUR IDEAS AREN'T UNIQUE OR SPECIAL, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND 10,000 OTHERS WITH BRILLIANT TINY """QOL""" CHANGES IS RANDOM CHAOTIC ARRANGEMENTS OF NEURAL PATHWAYS, EACH OF YOU ARE EQUALLY DESTRUCTIVE, USELESS ALONE, POISON EVERYTHING YOU ATTACH YOURSELVES TO AS A GROUP.
---
You can skip a lot of the niche totems
---
If you're talking about itemization, yes, absolutely. Obtaining useful gear in Classic feels way better and comes far less frequently than in modern WoW. But the low res textures and super limited use of 3D armor models is ass. There are so many fantastic sets from later versions it's unreal. The art team has put out consistently top quality work for the entire lifetime of WoW.
---
turning in the tokens does
---
Oh wow that's cool didnt know you could link into macros!
---
Whaaaaaat, why was it removed?!
---
Yeah that’s what I thought.
---
I mean quests like Mountain Lion blood where we as a group would have to kill like 500 mobs together and I'm just not bout that life
---
On Ally if you take Staff of Westfall as a warrior its awesome. the +11 spirit, i just equip it and wait and im full health in no time. It's like sitting down to eat! Although im only level 26 as of now, so im not sure when this falls off &gt;:
---
Good to know!
---
What zone is this? 1k needles?
---
I was also super confused by this. I don’t feel safe there till like 24.
---
Not the horde rogue poison quest. One head per kill, it was brutal
---
I knew it was a joke, plot twist.
---
Nerds!
---
&gt; you are super mistaken about how layers work
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; layers affect queues absolutely 0%
---
You are super mistaken about how layers work. Layering has allowed them to temporarily increase realm capacity. The reason they didn't have unlimited layers and allow everybody in they are playing a balancing game of predicted player loss and retention so that when layering is removed the remaining playerbase isn't more than can be supported on a single layer (or simply realm at that point because there are no layers).
---
&gt;layers affect queues absolutely 0%
---
That is completely incorrect. The layers significantly increased concurrent capacity, because they knew full well between player loss and people not all trying to play at the same time when the dust settles the concurrent demand is much higher initially.
---
It’s really great for keeping the leveling experience greasy for alts, as you can go through zones you hadn’t on your main.
---
I fished for a moment and they turned on me . I’ll be looking for “SWEAT” from now on.
---
NC you say? Do you reckon the recent hurricane has affected the service?
---
I joined one of those guilds that spams the whole server and casually asked in gchat if anyone had a spare bag. One dude just replies “gotchu” and then I didn’t hear from him again. 2 days later I find four wool bags and a bunch of other goodies in the mail with him. What did he ask in return? He wanted to know my least favorite super hero. Love this game.
---
yes, but it still shows the spawns on *the map* even if you're not tracking the quest
---
Skeram?
---
Ya that's pretty much my view as well. PvP is the main focus.
---
You can start doing dungeons at any time and you should be at least pulling your weight, though you’re marked as a warrior on Reddit so I would start dungeoning around 37-38 and farm Scarlet Monestary Armory for the Ravager on Herod. The weapon will help your dps a ton in Zul Farak and other AOE oriented areas. Warriors are also one of the best dungeon AOE specs once you get whirlwind at 36, so it is very fun.
---
Exactly. Spending 1-2g per level on water adds up and it only gets more expensive. I was in a good spot but the bottom dropped out of my mats. Will I get my mount at 40? Not anymore.  Will I wreck alliance with my engineering and expensive PvP consumables that no one is buying because the server is so fresh? Fuck ya I will.
---
They might have had a member that didn't need the mob and dropped to make room for you
---
&gt; Not entirely. If there are quest items on a mob and you have that quest, you can loot it if your group killed it, doesn't matter who was supposed to be "next up" for loot.
---
False. While gathering wailing essence, we killed an ooze, it wasn't my loot, I could not loot the body. Once the person whose loot it was looted it, I was able to grab the essence. This happened at least 3 times in one run(that I specifically counted while waiting for people to loot) of the wailing caverns just last night.
---
If your desperate for some pvp your best bet at the moment is to level to about 20 and head to the barrens.
---
As you get higher you share the zone you're levelling in with the opposite faction and can seek them out to do pvp. Stranglethorn Vale (or STV as you will commonly see on here is notorious for this.
---
Looks like a smug asshole.
---
A smart addon would scan outliers and remove them. Wonder if any of them do this.
---
I love assassination and sub for pvp.
---
It's inconsistent: some quest items drop for everyone that have the quest, so if you have 5 people, 5 quest items will drop and each player get to loot one of them, like in retail. But, mostly, quest items are shared and tend to be a low drop-rate, meaning that some people on your group will have, say, 7/1 items needed for the quest and another will have 2/10.
---
It's a PITA, honestly.
---
It was absolutely miserable. I got to 10 playing with some friends one night then tried to solo and was dying to warlock mobs because I could kill them but not their pet or vice versa, same level mobs. I even went to the auction house and get all intelect/stam armor and it still sucked.
---
The rogue it tougher to kill things 1 level above but same level and below is a breeze.
---
I'm on vacation right now and literally the only thing I can think about is which one I want to play when I get back :p
---
This is the only thing that gets my dick up these days tbh
---
Nice lol. I just quoted this movie yesterday.
---
If you're sticking with quest chains and getting good items out of them you will be fine :)
---
I enjoyed it thoroughly being tired of silly post
---
I macro my pet to attack on my opener. That way I can send him in there to build up threat as I cast immolate, if he’s too slow I can stop casting.
---
Just wait.  Fly from the boat in Darnassus to Silithus.  The flight is something like 25 or 30 minutes.
---
There aren't battle grounds yet
---
Just make sure it's a fish, not a crocodile, or a bugged fish that can swim in the air.
---
Thanks man and where should my talent points be going? I heard beast mastery mostly
---
When it comes to PvE, race doesnt matter. It only matters for PvP. Just pick the race you think looks coolest.
---
PvP isn't in the game yet.
---
It's pretty nice, but if pvp is your thing you need to switch to alliance. They are the minority faction so battlegrounds will queue instantly and there will actually be people to kill in the world.
---
Escape artist is definitely one of the best pvp skills in the game.
---
Short answer is yes, the nuancy answer is you have to avoid fears more and that can limit your options, while other times you can zerk and just delete someone.
---
Yes. They are viable tanks as fury or arms with a 2 hander all the way up to 60 if you can gauge your pulls correctly and it is infinitely more efficient than having a regular tank.
---
Only if im outa flash powder
---
What addon is tracking your level time?
---
I do the same, he's macro'd to Corruption, CoA, and Immolate so I have options. I even send him in before I start attacking to get the aggro building started, but it's never enough
---
Khazgorm has a long spawn time too
---
Most reasonable person on Reddit right here. Bless you.
---
And with layering, you don't have the ONLY vendor in the world.
---
You could at low levels but it would put a lot of needless stress on the healer. I'd grab a cheap shield from the AH.
---
That'll 100% get you murdered at higher levels.
---
Chrome OS, no.
---
No it doesn’t. They may just not want to play with people. Going solo doesn’t make you dumb or stubborn.
---
I learned this in retail after afk flying what i thought was straight up for about 20 minutes... turns out it wasn't very straight up
---
A lot, but also a culture shock. The game is played in some new and interesting ways. Don't let the fomo flow through you. Play how you like.
---
It's beautiful.
---
Haha I love these little storylines and conflicts that play out in the game.
---
/who people your level or join world chat!
---
At least Royal Apothecary Society doesnt hate due to green or pink skin, having tusk, is a cow, being small or tiny. We just hate everything that draw breath and quite a lot that doesnt. Not our fault that you all fall under that category, now back to some potion brewing.
---
Awesome, another horde corpse. Keep them rolling.
---
Killing a puppy is wrong but 20 silver is 20 silver.
---
I think I'm good for my hours though, its not like theyre all low level.. its so hard everything sounds fun its so difficult to try and stick with one thing even if I like playing it
---
Solo warriors unite!
---
Eats a stack of food rq
---
Grobbulus. Posture check
---
I literally have watched alliance do the same thing.
---
Moments before a gang of horde come in and wipe them all because it’s STV.
---
Get someone on a different layer to invite you. We have a channel on our server where we type !layer and you get an invite from level 1 bots
---
What a goober
---
hm weird because I never use CoC or AE in my combos.. didnt even buy AE too because it's not fire haha. I want to take advantage of the ignite talent so I just use flamestrike and blast wave a lot But I dont spam it all the time since I run out of mana fast so I just fireball/scorch whoever my tank is focusing
---
Its prob easier as frost but imo frost is way too boring spamming 1 spell while fire I use like 4-6 spells it's fun
---
you'd lose on rule 11 considering the amount of drive-by buffing I've seen unless you go out of your way to stay faaar away from people
---
Then get your two kills and leave the group.  You still helped the other person get two kills, and now they no longer have to compete with you...it's a fucking win/win.
---
That was very depressing to process, while imagining the kind of retards that work at Blizzard now.
---
Nah, the battlegrounds aren't released yet.
---
Are you not doing anything important at all where you just can't answer for awhile?
---
So you aren't making fun of someone for leveling resto in Classic, and then making a snotty comment about their leveling spec of preference? Yeah, you're not trying at all
---
To add to this on the threat part.  If you are on the edge of pulling more mobs... running closer can be bad also but usually not a problem.  At range I believe it is 130% of the top threat on a mob before it pulls off the tank and to you.  At melee it is 110%.  So let's say your tank has 4 mobs.  You pull one that he hasn't got extra hits on yet as you passed the 130%... you then try to run that mob to him... you were already at 120% with the other 2 non main targets and now you moved into range where 110 will pull instead of 130... you just made new friends.  
---
All of this happens in a very fluid situation where you need to make the choices quick.  Is the tank dying where you need to just stand there blasting heals?  Then stay where you are taking a few hits and wait while trying to heal.  Call out that you have a mob just in case the tank doesn't notice, sometimes could be a pat from behind.  Is the talk not taking much damage and you can kite that mob back away from the group and cc fear whatever?  Do that.  Especially in an aoe pull when the tank is gonna lose aggro to aoe anyways.  Of you can handle that one mob that only helps.
---
Bottom line just gotta pay attention to everything and hopefully we have a good threat meter soon.  It's not just for tanks, aggro management is a skill every class needs to work on.  Those ranged dps starting too early can turn an easy pull into a nightmare for the tank running around chasing everything.  Most dps I've tanked for so far have no idea how to control their aggro.  These are usually the longer runs.  People that don't attack your marks in the right order, have a skull and an x out there but for some reason you see hunters mark pop up on that third guy that has no business there.

i abandoned the quest

Google whatever it is you want to know but after it add "vanilla twinstarz". So "loch modan boar drops vanilla twinstarz"
---
I think I would just dungeon rush a priest meaning it'd have to be horde for RFC
---
I hate when my prime rib complains
---
so what should I do if something like that happens again? just roll need if I actually need it?
---
Hopefully they dont open any portals to the upside down. It was a bad choice.
---
And they wonder why we want to start a plague and wipe everyone out
---
Lol no. Miss my transmog sets from mythic hellfire citadel
---
Battlegrounds won't be added to the game until phase 3. Nobody knows yet when phase 2 (honour system) and then phase 3 will be released.
---
Dude I was like lvl6 in shadow glen and I got 3 spiders on my ass, they fucking dusted me
---
Overrated comment.
---
merci beaucoup :) i’m hoping the rp and wpvp promise of grob will add a lot more fun at max level.
---
You have the option to life tap, so I'd favor spellpower slightly
---
Thanks.
---
What are the professions you chose? I'm leveling two characters for skinning/leatherworking and tailoring/enchanting and it's pretty nice so far.
---
/laughs in Frost Mage while pulling 4 mobs and AOEing them down with ease.  
---
/cries because main is a warrior, and knows that feel.
---
You know of any super cheap laptops.
---
We all know that feel.
---
I feel bad for the wolves getting hip dysplasia
---
What the fuck
---
I've been tanking as a 100% Arms Warrior (literally no points in Prot/Fury) and I've been doing perfectly fine. Arguably Arms is the better tank in dungeons due to smoother Rage generation anyhow.
---
Just for your healers sake, remember to bring a shield and unlock your Prot abilities.
---
Yeah, leggings of the fang. Agility is an underrated warrior stat due to how well it scales melee crit. Also, there were no leather wearers in my group when it dropped.
---
Hey there's a dwarf in one too...
---
They aggro on you if their original target dies
---
I like it! Only thing I would change is that Stonetalon is contested, since both factions have towns and quests there, even though it's definitely more of a Horde zone.
---
Will of the forsaken and canabalise are great for PvP
---
wow, that guy would quit runescape before he leveled up once
---
I used to sell riddles on the AH in vanilla for 5, 10 and 20 gold. They’d be riddles and if they messaged me with the answer I’d send them 20, 50 or 100 gold depending on which one they bought.
---
Didin't say they were. Want it or not the shop button is there, all I'm saying is I wouldn't want to see any cosmetic or pets/mounts there as they don't belong in vanilla. Also take a chillpill mr. capslock.
---
Specifically stam/spirit food.

Nah.. I'm not near the coast.
---
Why do people care about censoring usernames? It's just a character name and you don't even know which server on.
---
That response was pretty chill lol I gave him a feasible option that would work right now. Not something blizzard would have to implement on their own
---
It most definitely is not.
---
Spells are batched in 200ms windows, so its unlikely that a small ping advantage would even help. Whichever player/party does the most damage in the first 200ms window is who gets the tag.
---
I use a target macro, and just spam that with an instant attack. Works most of the time. I do try an party when possible, but sometimes u gotta do what u gotta do.
---
I firmly disagree.
---
Something something something old joke something something not very funny either. 
---
If it gets added to the game. Fuck me im wrong. But the fact that hysteria is ensuing solely because someone says “in game shop” is ridiculous.
---
I'm certainly enjoying the community aspect and the in-depth story, but I do have a few gripes which I just put down to it being an old game 😊
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22798/might-of-menethil
---
There are coefficients depending on cast speed, but that's basically it.
---
Also once you hit your 30s there are a lot of options as far as 2handers go.
---
Whooooosh
---
Right?!
---
Idk maybe that was it tbh. I tried creating a 4th alt the night before launch and couldn't. Glad it's maybe different
---
*you have been removed from the group*
---
yea like if you want to level up your bite ability you need to tame a pet with the bite 2 ability and learn it
---
Thank you!
---
I do too appreciate it.
---
If I rmember correctly from my rogue some 10+ years ago (I'm playing a mage now, so yeah...) Assassination is generally all about building up combo points faster based on crits with your abilities. I remember a special ability crit gives one additional combo point. So if you crit with Ambush, for example, it does a ton of crit damage and gives you 3 combo points instead of 2. Finishing blows also give a combo point, restarting you at 1 point instead of 0. So the focus is racking up combo points and continually delivering hard hitting blows.
---
Combat, from what it looks like to me, is more sustained damage. For example, it improves your offhand weapon damage, it gives you parry and riposte. It is all about you amping up your normal white damage and doesnt focus so much on the hard hitting ambush and backstabbing. Especially with dual sword builds which cant backstab or ambush. Combat is probably the most popular one in PVP and PVE because it is the most steady and reliable source of damage. It doesn't depend on crits and you aren't shit out of luck if your stuff is all on cooldown.
---
Subtlety is about improving stealth and premeditated attacks. It doesnt have the combo point building talents that Assassination does, and it doesnt have the sustained long term damage abilities that Combat does. So in Subtlety, it is all about stealthing around, planning your targets, only striking when you know you can win, and finishing off targets as fast as possible. Otherwise you run out of steam in longer battles when your skills are on cooldown.
---
I'm sure there are exceptions to the rule that go against my explanations. Especially from people who do in depth research and crunch the numbers. I definitely dont do that stuff myself. This is just how I personally remember the high level differences between the three builds.
---
Imagine whats yet to come
---
I think you just got lucky, I have only got one blue boe so far and I am lvl 46
---
Yes, the August Celestials are all Wild Gods.

OMEGALUL
---
Only choo choo going on is yet another one of your posts not hitting 10 upvotes. Rofl
---
You're not kidding either. Every time I group with a Druid or Shaman I have an urge to create one. The game's not going anywhere so it really doesn't matter as long as you're having fun :)
---
&gt;You do know that a layer isn't a different realm right?
---
It is in effect a temporary additional realm, it's just transparent to the user. It's another entire copy of a continent. 
---
&gt;And that more layers doesn't make the queue go down
---
In a sense it does. An additional layer allows a higher concurrent population. But unlimited layers wasn't an option because after predicated losses and concurrent demand lowering they want a situation where once layering is removed the population is supported on a single layer (or simply realm at that point)
---
&gt;Once the layers are gone the queues will be the same
---
Not necessarily. If player retention is higher than expected, and population remains higher than a single layer can support then queues could return when layering is removed.
---
This. You'll have 30 skill within 10 seconds.
---
As a Druid, I always keep an eye for a leveling warrior. One heal can make a difference.
---
Is that a Gnome?
---
...because people are literally scum.
---
Ah the Rosetta Stone of reddit
---
It’s additive, it would 11%!
---
Dude like who even cares about such a thing? I pity your miserable concerns.
---
Wow negative 30, do people not like Questie?
---
Do battlegroups contain both pvp and pve servers?
---
Nobody's stopping them. We're just identifying them as dumb.
---
Pictures like this make me almost reconsider rolling horde on Herod. Almost...
---
ahahahaha
---
Either that or level with friends. My buddies keep saying they get better at higher levels but I'm not buying it. Plus I dont really want to be a heal bot end game.
---
I really want to tank but I keep seeing that warriors have it tough leveling up too (I mostly play solo since my altoholism has left me 15 levels behind my friends) and that druids struggle to main tank end game.
---
Also: the cliff near RFK
---
Razorfen Kraul
---
What server
---
As a new wow player what does this mean? Is this regarding the free mount warlocks get or am I misunderstanding?
---
That fishing quest @ 225 now \^\^
---
What actually pisses me off about it is that, when it procs versus a single mob, it usually does so four times in a row so you don't get any procs for the next minute or two, which is usually when the tank actually pulls a lot.
---
Prepare "BLADES OF LIGHT" macro for when you get a godly proc though.
---
Any of them that are worth playing on. Some drops can be worth literal thousands of gold and they are not something you can set out to farm. They are .001% drops on shared loot tables between mobs in a 10 lvl range or so. Very very different from a BoP that drops from a specific mob with a 30% chance. Those you can intentionally set out to get.
---
Lol. Having perfectly advantageous game experiences that revolve around you is a single player mentality. An MMO in a true PvP environment is the opposite of that. Simple facts
---
That quest triggered me so hard for some reason.
---
people deadass think that the healers are specced for healing as well lol
---
I’ve never played warrior before but thanks I’ll keep this in mind if I’m queuing with warriors!
---
Trolls are squirtes cuz they're 'blue *mon*.'
---
For a warrior its 2 mobs or 1 mob 2+ levels higher than me
---
Frost mage learning to AOE farm - Have an 8 pack now.

It's a fucking MMO lol

Everyone is doing AOE grinding lol

Not worth anymore

What she doesn't know is I keep all my gold on an alt.

I'm guessing this is Joe's account

Man you need to calm the fuck down. People rightfully hate the in game shop and get scared when they see it. You're literally ridiculous and pushing anti gamer game design
---
Makes me love new economies, buddy bought shadowfang for 2g from trade chat.
---
True but I've made about 20g by level 18 just fishing. 
---
(mind you I've been swimming the coast of STV but those Mithril Bound Crates have such amazing loot)
---
The Axe is decent, though.
---
The effect can be removed with /cancelaura, which people back then didn't seem to know otherwise they wouldn't have rated it so lowly.In instances where the tank pulls 3-4 mobs, it's actually beastly, outside of instances, it's still a decent weapon. I still keep it for instance runs (lvl 40), but also carry Mograins Might for leveling.
---
Yeah there is no bg's right now
---
I recall thaddius being pretty rough. We were in greens / some heroic gear though and got realm first.
---
isnt it "tarren mill"?
---
they have value to anyone who wants to buy it since you have to buy it lmao. any perverts are probably willing to drop 5k gold for thigh high greens like black mageweave and there are a lot of those
---
I was 59 at the time....and taking a shot at the one thing I ever really wanted to do. It takes tons of work and you have to be really good. Even then its a tough trade to get into. I knew that i was ok studying as long as my dad was alive but when he passed I had to get a job fast. Taking care of his estate, fighting my brother is going to be enough. It would take time to land a job and that I didnt have. Im getting IT certifications in hopes of landing a job when the time comes that I can survive on. Really dont want to work retail mgt again. 
---
I love 3d and am slowly learning unreal Engine. But there just doesnt seem alot of time and is very hard to concentrate. there seems to be something every few days. Its like trying to hold the dam together while knowing one day soon t will all crash in. I hope to be able to do 3d til my time in this world ends, just wont be for money.
---
Thank you for your thought
---
And? People don’t wanna play with others 24/7 maybe they just got done with dungeons and wanna play solo for a bit. Maybe people like the solo leveling experience.
---
Some how recently I started using thousand island.
---
Lol....

When you are rich and have a nice pool and house you have a pool party

This is why I couldn't wait to hit 42. I hit 42 and got my death coil. Now I can put the hurt back on.
---
It's not that simple. It should be: Classic is good
---
Retail is bad.
---
There.

He's dumping mana
---
My wife and I are doing Pally Priest combo, fun in DM not very fun questing Lol 
---
&gt;*"Do I use my wand"*
---
&gt; "Yes."
---
Late to the party, but my question is: how do you control the camera like that? I've got the rest of the controls similar to the op but just can't get the camera to work like that so it's kind of unusable because I can't even turn.
---
I'm so close...
---
If you're a veteran player and you need this chart you aren't a veteran player. its some of the most basic info in the game.
---
Yeah once you hit the skybox then your character will tilt and start to fly slowly in one direction. Side note, you can see the edge of the map if you fly north of hrothgar's landing in northrend
---
Nope
---
I use questie and immersion. Initially I turn off quest objectives but after finding it extremely time consuming I leave it on.
---
I still read quests due to Immersion. I find reading small chunks in a conversation like bubble makes it easier to read rather than getting the usual one big chunk and I end up skimming through instead.
---
I'd check used shops for that sort of price. Look for an i5 processor with a dedicated video card.
---
Pretty sure it only has around 4\~ procs per Minute. When it procs, it usually does 3-4 times in a row and then goes on standby for a good minute. I doubt it's "truly random".
---
ah  ty.  also left clickign the BT icon on minimap brings up the positioning and hilights them all
---
Last I checked they wouldn't be available till phase 5, dont quote me on it though.
---
Oh it's PvP. Just not your preferred version of it. Part of the reward of powering your character up is the freedom to mow down people as you see fit. Not fun for you? Power up your character and challenge them.
---
How else am I suppose to wait for these 150 copper ore to let?
---
Thanks a ton! 
---
You’d do this always, not just endgame?
---
Because they have no friends
---
First aid! Lol
---
&gt;I give them a smile and quick Hello as I ran past them, less than a second left on sprint, and pop vanish.
---
Alright there, Flash.
---
That's PvE which has completely difference results than PvP
---
no, that's mspaint with interface hiden
---
I had an opposite interaction near Dalaran. I was struggling to kill the mobs as I was maybe a level too low, but I was making headway. I had previously asked to be in a group that was already there to share the kills on the "prisoners" there, but to no avail or response. While I was struggling to kill some mobs trying to get to one of the quest mobs, the group comes in and waits for me to aggro the last mob (by accident) before running in to grab the quest mob.
---
One of them died in front of me later while I was working on some mobs. He asked for a rez.
---
I did not rez him.
---
My level 80 rogue also farms him for blood fang pants 😁
---
A troll mage can use berserk which is a different benefit basically
---
As someone who is married, I agree. Make sure you find someone who either engages with your hobbies or at least supports it. My wife is super into ice skating, I'm not, but I go watch her at the rink and watch the competitions with her cuz it matters to her. I learned what a Lutz is, what crossovers are, etc. Because I want her to feel that I support everything she is. 
---
She does the same for my hobbies, though she usually ends up actually engaging and liking them, like WoW and magic lol.
---
What does cleave mean? I saw chat spamming with "spell cleave" groups all day yesterday and had no idea what it meant..
---
Maybe a better question is how you arrived at seeing a listing for a plain letter on the auction house in the first place.
---
Level 37 rogue, killed many mobs.. no blues outside of dungeon boe. No epics, no /rolls over 50.. fk u
---
Chadlock*
---
We don't have world chat on whitemane. Someone for control of the channel, booted everyone, and password protected it.
---
Gz man! May I ask who got the item?
---
For me they aren't urges, it's my playstyle. Play a class to 20 be excited about hitting 20 and log off for a break. Come back roll new toon rinse repeat.
---
Renew is not as mana efficient so try to use heal if you have the time liberty
---
The crime here are your frames.
---
Necrosis? has a cut off button.
---
Priests are good farmers as Shadow, but are even better as AoE with Holy Nova in the right situations. When I played on a private server, I used a Disc/Holy priest. Spirit tap wasn’t used as you would use all your mana for each pull and would have to drink anyway.
---
I play on an Acer Aspire I got for like 400$ 5ish years ago, runs classic fine. Might look at that line.
---
Yeah my rogue is wearing random greens whites and greys. As an undead he  really looks the part.
---
Renew isn't efficient? I'm not at my computer at the moment, but that seems odd to me, can I get a second opinion here?
---
Yes dude I'm digging this classic wow return to roots when community was real and leveling up and gold was valuable and items meant something.
---
It is not
---
Our blacksmith warrior :D
---
Wait until you get to Duskwood. I was so used to juggling 3 mobs at once that when I started pulling skeletons it turned really fucking ugly real quick.
---
Thanks!
---
I got an edgemaster’s yesterday and I was offered 800g for it. I’m tempted, but I also feel like if I wait the market might develop further.
---
What do you think? Take the gold now or wait and see if edgemaster’s ends up more valuable when the economy settles?
---
Your alt rogue is the same level as my main.  I don’t get to play much..
---
Is that you “Imapenis”?! Already reported you so free name change should be coming!😡
---
The good thing about the macro is that it won't go off until the target appears and will go off instantly, if you're mashing it. Don't have to react to it spawning, just have to mash until it does
---
Look at the gear, this is clearly real.
---
Man I love playing the AH in games, but since I’m new to WoW... I couldn’t name any of these items, and I don’t know their future value 😕
---
Lul no, but I just reolled with the name "highonacid" soo yea
---
Distracting shot is a pretty bad example for (B). Any good hunter should learn how to use it while leveling as it's very good for trapping and/or controlling mobs in dungeons.
---
dwarves and gnomes are "beautiful races"? xD
---
Personally I just kill 3-4 trash mobs on the way to whoever I'm going to and the vendor sales probably cover a repair.
---
What in Davy Jones' locker did ye just bark at me, ye scurvy bilgerat? I'll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas, and I've led numerous raids on fishing villages, and raped over 300 wenches. I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another source o' swag. I'll have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag. As we parley I be contacting my secret network o' pirates across the sea and yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil. The kind o' monsoon that'll wipe ye off the map. You're sharkbait, fool. I can sail anywhere, in any waters, and can kill ye in o'er seven hundred ways, and that be just with me hook and fist. Not only do I be top o' the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my beck and call and I'll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o' the world, ye dog. If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment. But ye couldn't, ye didn't, and now ye'll pay the ultimate toll, you buffoon. I'll shit fury all over ye and ye'll drown in the depths o' it. You're fish food now

Wow another person posting q picture of their cat. Jesus Christ.
---
World first Thunderfury would be amazing this quick

---
I see that poor soul ended up with the same low tier VW name I did: Barnagma
---
I did a thing last year where i used Monitor to Phone software and used phone VR googles to play wow in first person mode. 
---
I also taped down my mouse right button, so that when the phone moved, the cursor moved, and the character view moved, I just had to "reset" it when i started so it aligned with my head. 
---
Of course I had no VR controller or anything, but I used a Ps4 controller and a mod that lets you controll your char with a Ps4 controller, so i could play the game and watch it in first person. 
---
It was pretty fucking awesome, I thought it wouldn't be so good, but it was really really immersive, especially with headphones and stereo headphones mode, and I can truly attest that WoW vr is/would be a glorious thing. 
---
It truly feels different when it feels like you run around in a 1:1 scare world as a gnome from their viewpoint.
---
Once on a p server before launch, I was waiting for Fangore and there was a group of 2 sitting waiting for him as well. I asked multiple times for an invite to no answer. When he finally spawned, I tagged him and the two people turned to me, hoping to watch me die. At the last second, a mage appeared and helped me kill Fangore. I looted him and smugly said something like, "Should've invited me" then they had to wait another 20 minutes for him to spawn lol
---
Haha I listen to those sometimes. Heit it whatever
---
Maxed all crafting skills in 3 minutes
---
Uh... it does if, like in a kill quest, there's a clear advantage to everyone involved if you do / disadvantage to everyone if you don't.
---
So many things i had no idea could be so much fun on an rppvp server.
---
A lot of clan activities like raids on the alliance, huge clan marches several hundred strong through Orgrimmar, an rp event in thunder bluff.
---
\--posted this elsewhere helps explain...
---
Why i picked rppvp
---
I'm  pretty new to rp i admit, did a little in Vanguard, but here it's so  supported and just f'in works so well within this World. ..of Warcraft  :)
---
Went to the big RP Event in TB  last night and i cannot express how immersive the whole experience was.  First i had to travel there on foot which took about half hour from  Trisifal. That alone is what experiencing an mmorpg world is all about.
---
I  announce i finally made it, and people moved over so i could sit down,  another player gave me food and water as i must be parched after my  journey. i mean i'm all in on classic.
---
Then  for the next two hours plus, they told stories of wisdom, of life, of  hope, talked about how the alliance has wronged the horde, and we should  seek peace and stop spilling blood, and so many people in the  amphitheater cheering supporting peace, then did a raid and cracked  alliance skulls haha lol
---
Seriously  though, it's by far the most enjoyable mmorpg experience i have ever  had, and now i know without a shadow of a doubt, i'm here to stay.
---
\--another story posted elsewhere...
---
 We did our first world raid last night and OMG, watching is one thing, being a part of it is another.
---
There are no words, this is the first time i went pvp in wow, was always pve, if only i knew what i was missing.
---
Sneaking into alliance territory, like a huge amount of people, moving through the forest, over the hills,
---
and... SURPRISE Mother F\*\*ckers!!!  omg it was so good.
---
Just  watching some other players like freeze like they are "O. M. F. G."  lol, run for their life's, then they start mobilize, more alliance  coming in from all directions and it's all out mayhem, f'ing legendary.
---
Took  over 400 screens shots. The rush. I can't wait to be on the other side  of a surprise attack, i mean you don't even care if you die, it's all  out f'ing WAR!!!
---
Oh and great vid, love it, Thanks!!! I gotta set up some recording like last night was like yours EPIC!!!
---
In this scenario I approve corpse camping.  Way to get your revenge!
---
Haha
---
How should I prioritize pet skills as a BM hunter? Leveling 45-60, should I only use one resistance in order to afford survivability?
---
&gt;"Downranking" is the act of using lower rank spells on purpose. It's incredibly useful for healers as the lower ranks cost a little bit less mana per point healed and will become especially mana-efficient once you get a large amount of +healing.
---
For resto druids: at level 60 you will be spamming rank4 healing touch in raids. You can continuously cast it without running oom.
---
As someone on a RP server... every drop is a possible new outfit. No one wants to show up to and event in their adventuring clown suit.
---
I believe.
---
Just immagine... most people aren't even 60 yet, and this dude just oneshots everybody with the best weapon ingame. GG for the most lucky drop possible. Stuff like that legit can only happen once
---
Lol gorilla warfare
---
Laughs in priest bubble
---
Felicia Day is great.
---
I tried killing my video game addiction, but classic brought it back with a vengeance.
---
So I’m aware of auto-run. But is there a command that makes you follow the road from one place to another without any input?
---
Like west fall to storm wind? And you don’t have to press a single button till you get there? And don’t want to pay for flying either.
---
Exactly.  People are free to be totally solo, or lazy, or dicks, but if you clearly do something against the common interest, expect to be called out for it.
---
I wouldn't characterize this post as hysteria. An open conversation about potential in-game MTX is worth having, and voicing concerns here helps Blizzard understand its Classic community.
---
I used 
---
/target &lt;name&gt;
---
/startattack
---
macros as a warrior and beat a handful of 5 man groups. Feels really good.
---
Would they really? It would cause all those characters to lose their names
---
Every. Got. Damn. Tiiime.
---
Careful, he’s a hero.
---
To me it look like a leprechaun to me.
---
All you gotta do is look up in the tree.
---
Who all seen the leprechaun say "yeah!!!"
---
So does mine (380), and it isn't even near the biggest or highest level. people worried about dead servers are worried over nothing.
---
“No... Mr Griffin no here”
---
There are a ton of differences, for sure!  Both have pros and cons.
---
Man, I’ve got to get me an account again. I haven’t really played since cataclysm. This is the Game I remember falling in love with. These are the kind of things that made WoW great.
---
It literally says iPhone in the title my guy.
---
dude, its the zone south of blackrock mountain
---
Mofo Death Knights giving AOE water walking and they turn it on. I forgot what dungeon or raid people would troll and turn it on when you jump into the water
---
Cant get TF until BWL comes out, You need elementium ore that dropa from there and also the elementium bar pattern that you get from mindcontrolling a goblin in BWL.
---
Feels like people only invite mages these days
---
As someone who never did original naxx (at that point in time), I really enjoyed Naxx10/25.
---
Most warriors level with a 2hdr.  Needing on a 1 for a role you aren't doing in the dungeon is greed, not need.  If he rolled against a shaman or a dps who needed the 1 hndr, yeah, I'm going to bitch the dps warrior for taking a tanking piece.
---
How does someone even do that?
---
Wow another guy shitposting on a cat picture... 
---
Jesus Christ
---
No it doesn't. If someone doesn't want to group with someone, they shouldn't. Trying to shame people for wanting to play solo by saying they are dumb or stubborn, even when people point out there's several reasons people may not want to, is ACTUALLY dumb AND stubborn. Feel free to group up with others, but don't try and insult people for wanting to play the game differently than you.
---
It’s a MEETING STONE, not a summoning stone. It’s where your group should be meeting before going into the dungeon together.
---
I like that every level you unlock at least something wether its talent points, new abilities/higher ranked abilities, new dungeons, mounts. I feel like I achieve something every level. Where in retail its like whoopee lvl 16, only 14 more levels til my next talent, and 7 for my new ability.
---
Grats! Hope to join the club this weekend.
---
Because I was wrong and thought it was a different tower lol
---
What is the addon on the top left corner? I assume it's to level?
---
They are "beautiful" races yes
---
Thanks a bunch :) I'll post there
---
I don't mean I pop out of bear during a pull to heal.  I mean right at the end of a fight I top everyone off to save healer mana and get the group ready for the next fight quicker.
---
I can three pull on my Holy Paladin. ^(Provided the mobs are grey)
---
That was an absolute A+ guide and an exact response I was looking for without knowing it. Thank you so much!!! I am more excited than ever to get home and get back onto my rogue!!
---
How long can Shaman tank? Like up to what level dungeon?
---
Making rogues thistle tea, you make 10 tea with 1 swiftthistle?
---
Don't bother with resistances IMO unless you're raiding or farming one area with a particular type of damage for an extended period of time. Just focus on your active abilities and armor/stamina.
---
Then go back to retail
---
For the most parts it doesn't work too well, If you need drops it's almost worse being in a group.
---
Works just fine for me.
---
I have had nearly a 100% success rate at first tag whenever i have invited and asked him to do it with a Moonfire macro. 
---
It's got a lot of damage instantly and a tick of damage very quickly after too especially if it's kept been upgraded through the levels.
---
this is a lot of text from a level 20 commenting on tank balance that doesn't realize demo shout spam out threats any other tank
---
I use layering frequently because I get tired of showing up wanting to do a quest to only be greeted by 50 UD mages AoE farming the entire zone.
---
I group up with people solely because they can raged pull 1 mob with Warrior nearly every kill humanoid mobs is basically just praying other people have cleared it enough there arent the whole 5 man squad tightly packed together.
---
Off topic but iv always wondered why the symbol for evasion is a purple skull.
---
Still forever until they can craft it. But at least it’s not just a dream now.
---
Worst I've seen in all my life

---
THANK YOU!
---
Maybe he's the tauren daddy
---
A lot of players got the 'fuck you, got mine' mentality this time around. Oh you cleared the mobs around the chest/node and are currently dying from them? Fuck you its mine.
---
Trying to kill stuff as melee? fuck you i'm gonna follow you and tag everything before you can even get in range (looking at you druids)
---
Oh rare drop in dungeon that someone needs? Fuck that, it vendors for 40s.
---
I realize all these assholes existed in vanilla and retail but damn it feels like its cranked to 11.
---
Wish I knew
---
If they’re having more fun solo, they’re playing the game the way it’s most enjoyable for them 💁🏼‍♀️
---
I don't mind spamming chats to form a party, but it is painful when you have stragglers that make everyone else wait 5-10 mins. Would love if this was able to summon.
---
Your memory is false, they never functioned like that in vanilla.
---
Nope tauren are kodo and wolves only
---
Depends entirely on realm.
---
Care to explain?
---
Please have him do. What an awesome dad you’ve got
---
i have been thinking a lot about why classic is a better leveling experiance. it is so much less is more. less levels means fewer bigger steps. less gear means bigger upgrades. enemies that can kill you if you pull more than one gives reason for more gear.
---
if doing quests only offer an item for a certain slot every 4-5 levels that would be in retail like once every 10 levels. ofc the gear you get once every 10 levels is going to be an upgrade there is a lot fewer steps. this also gives room for crafting, dungeon and even pvp rewards if you really need that upgrade. i mean certain items in classic are amonst the best you can get for 10 plus levels that would be like skipping the TBC/WotLK area untill you saw a single upgrade clearly it is going to be huge when you get somthing that good and feel good to finally get somthing better as it is now old.
---
amen comrade
---
how does one re spec their talents?
---
I've been doing 20 pushups per death on one day, then 10 pullups per death the next, alternating days.
---
Gotta push and pull.
---
Ok thanks for the info. Any suggestions on good ones that won’t take all day to get in?
---
Crossrealms and the crossrealm "insta pop" LFG tool did it for me, sure it was faster, but no reason to talk to anyone ever again, and everyone started to act like dicks if they actual said something since there were no consequences anymore like there was with realm communities.
---
But yeah, dumbing down stuff, removing talent trees, and having the open world pretty much pointless beyond leveling, all those are culprits too. I remember farming for hours on in vanilla because gold was tight and drops were useful one way or another, in current wow there is no reason to farm anything, nothing has any value other than the latest instance tier...
---
That’s fucking dope
---
Isn't it Perl classic?
---
People don't have money as was already said. Making me think I may have made a mistake going alchemist so early, but it's a little better over here for 20s per potion I think.
---
I did read the TOS and cloud gaming is against TOS. They have said they already and ban people who do it. No one has been banned for using a legit remote desktop.

It’s the Beards
---
Uh huh, that dub she did for dragon age was trash.
---
As somebody else who is leveling a pally tank, its a wildly different beast. Tanking in general is much tougher than in any other expansion. Your party needs to understand that they need to wait a couple seconds before they are allowed to start DPSing (which is not exclusive to paladins, by the way.) 11 points into Holy for Consecration early can be really good for instances when you cannot rely on CC. 
---
Use target markers, people love to target skull - the command /tm8 can be put into a macro, i like to put it on my Judgment so anything i Judge gets a skull. 
---
Speaking of Judgment, only use Judgment of the Crusader against Bosses - you need the threat generation from Righteousness far too much on short fights. 
---
If you lose aggro, throw out a stun. Since you don't have a taunt the best you can do is lock down the target and hope Judgment + Righteous Fury is enough to pull them back to you. 
---
Running with randoms, Blessing of Salvation is amazing. Letting your mage or rogue let loose and not need to worry about losing threat to them as much is great.
---
You NEED mana. Spirit is way more valuable than you probably think it is at first glance, and I personally tend to itemize it over strength even, as a vast majority of your threat comes from holy damage, even in the early game.
---
Pallies work just fine, but vanilla pallies work very differently than in every other expansion.
---
Hope he got the sexy onslaught girdle to go with it!

We’re talking about kill quests, not gathering ones.
---
What is the best disc spec that works great for PvP and PvE? There is a lot of potential with a lot of talents, but I've never played priest let alone Vanilla so I am not sure where to place the points.
---
Yeah I think it should be working. Does it work from the innkeeper? Ignore all the noobs that don't understand how they are meant to work in vanilla.

I've had bags I've out grown and gave them to lower level players, gave a silver rod to an enchanter who needed it. I love giving materials to my guildies as well as buff food I make. It feels so good to be able to help people out again in this game.

This. My most memorable experience was AV with my hunter. My god that was slaughter.

Nothing, you’ll get bored and ask for content which to blizzard means raids.

Really neat watch

must suck during intense pulls then

So glad I rerolled to PvE server.

Oh shit retaliation is on cooldown

Meh. In vanilla I died in Tanaris once and spawned at the Darkshore graveyard. I ran that just so I could say that I did it.

Classic codex is miles better

Kk then don't have fun lol

This is psyops

Evidently.

Can I pre download classic before I subscribe?

Yes, they did.

They will all be level 20 still a month from now  spending half your free time waiting in a Que plus not enough quest mobs because of population should be a fun time .

Nah, just enough to buff ur party

If you’re west coast go Rattlegore.  High pop but, but manages to stay right at the queue limit. Longest I’ve ever waited is like 5 minutes.

Vendor price and auction house price are different.  Auctionator will show you both though (the last price it saw) if you do AH scans with it whenever you're in town.
---
Halved experience gain is the main thing.
---
Why mankrik great til he gotta be great
---
The axe is bis until 60 if you do AoE dungeon farming for EXP and theres no argument against that, no other weapon is going to out DPS it when you're pulling 4+ mobs. Also it doesn't take much effort to get ravager and it's similar DPS to whirlwind axe, which is a pretty lengthy chain that requires a group if you want to get it done early.
---
Our warrior tank was using it for ZF exp farm and he was pulling 70% of a mage dps when we were pulling 10~ mobs at a time. It's insane and every warrior should get it for lvling if they plan on doing dungeons.
---
They have a timer when spells happen to alleviate the latency difference between players.  Every 400 ms a batch happens so that macro all the parts would happen at the same time with no interrupt.  The first two parts don't trigger a global cooldown so they stay in the same batch as going back into bear form and happen all at once.
---
You make a good point, but it's going to take a mob to change it.
---
Have you gotten debuff timers on enemies to work w/ elvui? It’s the only thing stopping me from using it. I’m not a warlock.
---
Thanks for that! I am definitely leaning towards warlock, flexibility is something I really enjoy. I just gotta get over being a popular race/class combo
---
Yeah this is not good level range variance is way too spread
---
Thank you for your response. I am curious as to why you put quotes around free. Is there a catch to this?
---
1) Doesn't want to group
---
2) Feels stressed in groups
---
3) Tired of Grouping
---
4) Sick of dealing with people
---
5) Other personal reasons
---
6) They don't like you
---
7) They are waiting for others
---
8) They feel they can complete the quest faster solo
---
9) They are almost done and can quickly get it done
---
barrens is the place friend

I have no idea how I’ll have 100g by level 40. Currently 29 with 10g

Hahaha, best use of this meme I've seen so far.
---
I've spoken to merchants who say "I've got the best deals on both continents." I can't remember if this was a voice line or text, but yeah. Obviously blizzard knew the world was bigger but this isn't always reflected by every element in game.
---
I bet Mankirks Wife is deep in your southern region.
---
I tried that, every roll had me thinking about the other classes. I did rule out shaman though. I suppose I lean more towards undead warlock coz I love zombie movies and lovecraftian themes, but  I worry about being such a popular race/class combo. I suppose I just gotta get over that though
---
Were you talking about your big dick while you were with them?
---
Attunement required
---
I remember my guild in wotlk couldn't get past the third or fourth boss before we gave up. Even before them, we wiped numerous times. Yes, we were collectively shit at the game, none of us had done much raiding and I literally turned 80 20 minutes before the raid.

There is a difference between only selling non-random cosmetics and selling lootboxes that contain items to provide player power.  EA has been guilty of egregious use of the latter, Blizzard has only used the former in WoW.
---
I’ve heard it isn’t either, but I’ve only read other comments on reddit that said so lol

We've been working on improving the database, there's a lot of caveats because the data is sourced from mangos database, which isn't totally accurate in every area. And there have been some problems in the available quest logic
---
Should be a lot better in current/future updates, accurate available quest icons is super important.
---
As for general map clutter, its tough to deal with in some situations where things drop off every mob in the zone (or when you pick up all quests). The plan is to add different display modes (polygons on mouse-over instead of icons for example) but there's still missing 1.12 features and general bugs we need to work through first. Sorry it gave you so much trouble
---
Wouldn't be surprised if it's a dev self-inserting a DnD character they once played or played with.

Or on the constantly growing hit list

No. For all the abuse people say is happening I've literally seen none personally.

Considering (as we’ve seen for multiple expansions) gear and consumables do not provide player power if it is not utilized, it’s not pay to win. It doesn’t provide an unfair advantage over any other player.

After briefly reading a short couple of paragraphs about what the Engineer does in GW2, it sounds like a jack of all trades kind of class that can build turrets to do various jobs (attack, heal, etc), use gadgets, bombs, etc. I'm not sure what their equivalent class would be in WoW? Maybe a Shaman with totems that do different things, and the Shaman can cast spells, attack melee, or heal. Sounds like the Shaman would have some of the most versatility that you seek. Then pick up the engineering profession in WoW for bombs, gadgets, and quirky little gimmicks on top of your already versatile class. If you want to do endgame raids, then Shaman are pretty much only accepted into raids as healers. Otherwise, just go play and have fun doing your thing.
---
The Hunter might also be somewhat close (as close can be) to a GW2 Engineer. The hunter has a pet that you can send out to go attack or pull mobs. It's an additional damage source like a turret, I guess? Plus you're ranged DPS and you can sort of sneak around to pluck off casters and exploit weak points in an enemy battle line.
---
Thieves in GW2 sound mostly analogous to WoW's Rogues with stealth, dual wield, venoms, etc. I had a lot of fun 10+ years ago as a Rogue. It was one of my favorite classes to play in WoW because I love the sudden element of surprise, picking battles on your terms, sneaking around places you aren't supposed to be, doing a lot of damage in general. While they are solely a damage dealer, they have a lot of methods and skills to choose from depending on what you're fighting, whether it be expose armor for plate armor, or a kick to interrupt a magic caster.
---
The cool thing is that you can create 10 characters per server, and 50 characters total. So you can try each class and experiment until you find something you like enough to stick with. If you put time into a class that you end up not liking, then you will at least know the basics of how that class operates so that you know how to support them if they are on your team, or how to deal with them if they are against you. If you struggle to learn the issues that a class deals with, then when you work with one, you will know what to do in order to help them. So it's never a waste of time.
---
One of our warriors, Enios, said "Brb tornado" during raid, and quickly logged. Except he wasn't joking. 
---
I still laugh about it to this day (he's fine, nothing bad happened).
---
Alright that makes sense I had a jist of what I should prioritize but I always played melee until legion, I played a mage in legion/bfa but int/sp works diff there, first time really maiming a spell caster in this old version of the game, thank you!
---
Nah they say go find Fred he’s west of here. Then you go west, and he’s not there, so you go west some more and he’s not there, you don’t yourself, you reread the quest, you continue waking then you are literally on the other side of the map, yup there he is!
---
I can see how it could be seen as this, however, I was more thinking alone the line of progressing the retail story from whatever point they have created (even now with n’zoth release, let the old gold rain cripple us and we have to fight back from nothing, with nothing).
---
Can someone help me understand weapon speed and how it relates to overall dps?  As a warrior I am seeing other warriors pass on daggers for being "too fast", even though it had 2-3 more dps than their current one handed axe or sword.  How is overall dps of the weapon not the end all be all factor?
---
I shit you not I knew this was coming as I was writing the post. I'm too stubborn for my own good.

i haven't raided in awhile, so i actually have no fuckin clue how i handled that

Hey guys so i just got a Night Saber as a pet in Darkshore, and on Wowhead (Classic), it says that the pet has the "growl" ability, but mine does not have it. Is it a mistake on wowhead's part or am i missing something?
---
Sometimes yeah
---
Its not, the client is the retail client adapted to run the game as it was, and so there is already all the stuff coded in there anyway.
---
We're also planning on adding more options, like polygons that show on mouse-over instead of a lot of dots, and small colored dots similar to pfQuest
---
Lot of planned features but we've been focusing on correcting bad data in the DB and fixing important bugs / pulling in things we couldn't finish in beta (like the quest tracker)

Yes, it's actually your settings since you tell us about the menu thing. The answer is in the the nvidia control panel available, but since you're kind of a dick that's all I'm going to tell you.
---
But yes, I'm sure it's just the game despite people who play it on half the hardware get a better experience than you. It certainly couldn't be your settings outside the agme, most definitely not. Your 970 is just a piece of shit that can't hold it's own against the monster that is WoW experiencing huge performance problems while everyone else can.. Mhmm that's it.

Its reddit. If 1% are outraged theres a debate. The smaller group can be the loudest.
---
I agree with you. I can (and do) accept group invites to do a single-mob kill quest. But I haven't accepted group invites to lengthy grind quests such as the one where you bring 60 quillboar tusks to Mankrik. Why? Because my boyfriend recently was discharged from a long hospital stay, and frequently needs me to tend to him. So, I would be going AFK too often and annoying whomever I am grouped with.

They just need to go the OSRS route and have in game polls to vote on what kind of changes they want. That made OSRS amazing. I honestly gave up OSRS for wow classic, but if by the time I hit max level and run the raids a few times and get the gear I want there is no new content, I'll probably go back to OSRS.

There's a sweet spot and it depends on whether the mobs are your kivek, slightly above, or slightly below. In general a group of 2-3 can finish a lot faster in my experience even with individual drops

Pff. Whoever has instantspells

---
I was leaning towards going with swords and using hemo, no dagger talents. Imp gouge in combat and then assassination
---
Didnt fall for anything, this was all based on my own observations.  Blizz told all of you a bunch of bullshit and you ate it right up, try and question stuff instead of accepting right away.
---
If you are still leveling and want to do some damage in pve and be able to wreck some people in pvp, I would reccomend Sub/Combat daggers.  
---
[At lvl 35 this is my spec](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=rogue&amp;t=uNuOtmtwtvueumunuoupt~ufuguhuiurusuttktRtltStTtdtFtGtHtI)
---
Why it's fun:  Remorseless + Improved Ambush = guaranteed critical ambush for 20 seconds after killing a mob.  Ambush damage is fucking massive.  Even just having a 55% crit chance from improved ambush is hot.  The build works (despite people saying leveling as daggers is bad) because you get to start every fight with any non elite enemy at less than 50% health.  For same level opponents for me, it's usually Ambush -&gt; Gouge -&gt; Backstab -&gt; Eviscerate = dead.  The downside is it isn't that great at soloing elite enemies.  Very fun to drop crit ambushes on other players in pvp.  Backstab is also fun in pvp.  
---
Sub is the most fun talent tree for sure, but the damage is not very good compared to combat.  
---
Assassination is good but doesn't offer a lot past cold blood (until your gear is very good).  Sub is similar, in that premedetation sucks, and deadliness isn't that good until you have very good gear. 
---
Also keep in mind that rogue as a class doesn't really benefit from going straight to the 31 point talent like other classes, except maybe for combat.  That's why things like cold blood/prep are so popular in pvp.  
---
I'll probably go with something like [this](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=rogue&amp;t=uNuOtmtwtvueumunuoupt~ufuguhuiurusuttktRtltStTtdtFtGtHtIuIuJuKuPuSuTuLuMu9uDuEuFuGuHucujuquwuxu2u3u.u4) for 60 unless I decide to spec full pve before then for some reason (raids).  
---
Another fun spec:  [Hemo Maces](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=rogue&amp;t=tYt8t9t_t.t~ufuguhuiucujt-uaubu2u3u4uquwuxyUu.tmtwtvthtrtdtFtGtntVtotWtitqtUtNtOtPuUuVuWtQvdtgtxtytztA) (though it doesn't really come together until close to 60 when you have hemo and full mace spec.).  
---
If you're playing a rogue to play a rogue though, imo you need camo and improved sap.  Those two talents make playing a rogue feel so much better.  They are both very good in pve and pvp really, until you get to a raid setting where they lose value.  Improved Sap is god tier in pvp and solo pve imo, and probably the most underrated talent rogues have.  against groups of mobs it lets you take out 1 enemy and fight the rest on better terms while still getting an opener.  In PvP it is a hard to get rid of CC and is critical for your role as a defense or recapture.  The other (nearly) necessary talent is relentless strikes.  It's just so good in almost every situation that the only reason I would ever skip it would be for hemo maces just because of the troll factor of mace procs and the hilariousness of Prep + Endurance + improved sprint + Improved kick.
---
I would say so, however server and marker economy can play a huuuuge factor.
---
It is real Hard to gauge now how this will work, it could be better than it used to, or worse.
---
Try both for an hour or two, and try to decide for youself. I tend to set a time frame to fish in, like "ok I will fish here for 15min,then take a walk" type thing. It isnt exactly fun to fish, but it really is good money specifically because of that.
---
PVP can't recommend it enough.

No, it never says there's no real abuse. It only says that the reports of people filling entire banks with resources are false. It never even once addresses people layer hopping for mobs.

It’s fine to not like it, that’s an okay opinion. But to assume that cosmetic selling is going to cripple a game and be its downfall is asinine. It’s done good for many games.

The sale of items that increase player power and provide an unfair advantage over players that don’t buy into it, that’s a big fucking issue and can lead to the downfall of a game.

Ambush only gives 1 CP in vanilla.  You can get 3 if you crit with seal fate and also have initiative proc though.
---
Because it pulls threat from the tank in dungeons, meaning he's gonna have a hard time keeping things from running amok and killing all of you. You only need to right click growl to turn it on/off during dungeons.
---
Maybe he was running at a different resolution
---
I understand your point, but to dissent a little.
---
By legion, we’ve already crushed the lich king and a bunch of other really powerful bosses. All our characters are already seriously bad ass and accomplished by then, so I think it’s reasonable to level with a legendary. The characters themselves are pretty damn legendary. 
---
I’ve had a beer and don’t feel like reconciling the fact that an rpg can’t really hand out such powerful goodies with the fact that we kinda earned them.

That's just an insane stance to take, it doesn't take a lot of thinking to realize the huge benefit of being able to AoE grind a group of mobs, switch layers, and immediately be able to grind them again. Even if you're only switching between two layers, that's double the amount of mobs for a given respawn time.
---
But I deleted it myself 45 minutes ago...

I just click to move on the horizon.

I feel the sentiment.

I used to read up on the raids back in vanilla when I was a rookie, and just imagining how tough Naxxramas must have been at the time. You'd wonder how some were able to deal with that monster. I used to think raids were something only the most elite players could hope to conquer. 
---
So, one night I was invited to a fun run in Naxxramas back during Burning Crusade. Just a shits and giggles type of affair. By that time I'd already been dabbling in the endgame so I was much more experienced. Yep. You still had to follow certain mechanics in Naxxramas even at level 70 because you would still get wrecked. I used to wonder how it was done 10 levels earlier the way some of the bosses worked. 
---
Anyway. I was excited to see the raid come back in Wrath but I had my hopes up a little too high... some guild mates and I hopped straight into 10-man after romping through heroics to get gear. Man I'll never forget the disappointment that night. I was expecting something threatening on at least the level Karazhan was when I first entered, but shit we steamrolled through the raid and I'd had two of my Tier 7 normal pieces already. 
---
25-man ramped things up a bit but nothing a regular raiding guild couldn't handle.

When is says you're too far away, do you have your melee weapon out? Try using a ranged skill to swap to your ranged weapon again, or cast the "auto fire" ability

Enchanting allows you to create wands while you level, which can be useful. Alternatively, skinning will allow you to make some money by selling the materials on the auction house

Fishing elementam water pools in azshara is one of the most profitable things you can do early on. Not alot of people has fishing, but ALOT of people want elementam water. Sure, it can be grinded on mobs too, but competition will be fierce and mobs far and few inbetween.

It was either that or she was going for a nice drive with Chris Brown, I’m sure she’s fine tho

[deleted]
---
Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F. as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robyn F. picked up Brown's cellular phone and observed a three-page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.
---
A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.
---
Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.
---
Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'
---
The detective said "Robyn F." then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.
---
Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'
---
After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'
---
Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.
---
Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.
---
Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.
---
Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.
---
Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.
---
Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.
---
She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.
---
Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.
---
I know right!! We should have extra points!

I’m playing classic everyday I can for a few hours at a time and I really can’t tell the difference and maybe it’s because I’m not up there in levels yet but if no one had ever told me this was happening I wouldn’t ever be able to tell. Give it a shot man. Might still suck you in.

For those to lazy to click the link.   ￼ Patch 1.7.0 (13-Sep-2005):
---
You will no longer be kicked from the meeting stone queue when a player declines a group invite or when inviting someone that is already in a group.
---
You will now be informed that you have left the meeting stone queue when the group leader logs out.
---
Tanks and Healers will now be immediately added to the group by the meeting stone when they are the 5th member of the group.
---
You can now be added to a group by the meeting stone when that group contains characters that have disconnected.
---
￼ Patch 1.6.0 (12-Jul-2005): Players now receive an error message if they try to join a meeting stone queue and are in a raid or are not the party leader.
---
￼ Patch 1.5.0 (2005-06-07):
---
Innkeepers around the world now have a gossip option that lets you join a meeting stone directly from the innkeeper rather than going to the location of the meeting stone. Also these Innkeepers will now have background lore about each of the dungeons.
---
Levels Required for meeting stones have been increased. The intent is that a group will not receive party members from a meeting stone that don't really have a chance of completing the dungeon.
---
Meeting Stones have had their rules for what players are grouped with what other players relaxed. This means groups who use meeting stones (or innkeepers) should have their groups formed much more quickly than they were previously.
---
￼ Patch 1.3.0 (07-Mar-2005): Meeting Stones added.
---
Don't let it frustrate you man. We all know what we know and sometimes we don't know. Hah

---
I'd say it depends on why you grouped up. If you grouped because the content is too hard to solo then you should stay. However, if you group up to not fight for the spawns then you can leave when done, the objective of not competing for spawns succeeds when you leave the area.
---
Was killing the 3 quillboar leaders in the southern barrens. Started with a group of 5. I did the quest twice just to help the new group didn’t mind was social and it nice change to questing in bfa where every 20 people sit on the spawn and try to do the least possible to kill it

This has happened so often for me. Walking into a quest area, then suddenly the memories just slap me right there. Suddenly I'm like "okay, so this spawns here, this guy does that.." ect ect. It's so great.
---
So THIS is ultra instinct?
---
Any idea how? I haven't played in years and this battle.net app is kinda confusing. I can download retail wow no problem but I can't find a classic option
---
I’m gonna do my part.
---
God I wish I read the like 4 hours ago
---
Are you saying the earth is flat???
---
I did Auction House speculation on gathering materials back in classic wow years ago. Buy low, sell high. You have to already have some gold in order to start, and you have to have some bags in order to hold onto items for a few days. And be aware there is risk involved (hey, just like the real life stock market... and CYA: I am not a financial adviser. Should go without saying because yeah, who gets real life investment advice on World of Warcraft).
---
Pick a couple items you know will sell and that people always need. Pick an item that fluctuates prices regularly. Finding the right items to sell can be time consuming. And they can change, so don't always stick to the same item for eternity. Pay attention to their AH prices. Let's do a hypothetical situation. None of these are real numbers, just think about the concept.
---
Say you decide that Iron Bars are what you want to sell. Day 1, it is 10 silver a bar. Day 2 it is 2 silver per bar. Day 3 it is 7 silver. Day 4 it is 11. Day 5 ...
---
Eventually, after so many days, you observe that the average rate of an Iron Bar is 8 silver. The max is 14 silver. The min is 3 silver.
---
So whenever you check the AH (regularly), you buy Iron Bars whenever you see them below 8 silver. Then in a few days, because you picked an item that fluctuates in price, in theory it will increase again in price. You resell when the price goes up. You picked an item that people always need, so they will pay whatever they can find. You have now made some revenue. You keep some and re-invest into more items to resell and the cycle continues.
---
You do not have to be a miner, or an alchemist, or whatever. You are buying items as is on the AH and then reselling them.
---
NOTE: There will be times you think an item will sell and make you a lot of money, but you are wrong and its a bust. Now you are stuck with a load of shit nobody wants anymore. This happened to me when Cataclysm came out and people could fly mounts everywhere in Azeroth. If people needed raw materials, they just hopped on their mount and flew wherever they needed to collect it themselves. An abundance of raw materials flooded the market and dropped prices way below what I payed for them. It fucked me over.
---
Your greed is your own worst enemy.
---
In fact, you should chill out before any new patch release that introduces new content. What people want to buy changes when game content changes.
---
You're really banking on people who don't want to spend hours farming materials in far away places themselves.
---
I'd just backpeddle. Occam's Razor.
---
You’re right they can do just fine. Not better than combat swords though, ever. And the best PvP spec throughout all of vanilla is hemo swords, I don’t think it’s debatable but I respect that you disagree.
---
Complete noob here, why is having a slower attack speed beneficial?
---
Played up until Wotlk myself so it's been a long ass time for me as well and I'm loving every bit of it again :)
---
same :D 100% agree.
---
Gathering quests are bad with randoms though. You can end up completing the quests faster just by getting the tags and not sharing the loot.
---
Kill quests it doesn't really matter for me if the person afks for periods at a time, I can always just leave and it doesn't effect anybody. I always group when their are other people for them.
---
or they've outleveled you and  you're stuck bringing up the rear! ugh
---
You can buy robe of the void... it's boe.  Also not getting it... in mc there is a replacement that warlocks take that priests and mages don't generally,  they keep their tailoring counterpart unless they don't have them either.  Should last until zg?  Something like that.  So either buy it or just get the next best thing until the mc chest.  Skarm put out a good video a week or so ago talking about all the loot and which class it should go to and gives a bunch of these little tips along the way.  This is for min/max type guilds, casuals will just want it if it's an upgrade even if they get a better one in the next raid when you have to wait 3 phases before you would upgrade again.
---
Blizzard cant learn the lesson, Activision needs to.
---
Please ignore the ignorance but I'm new to WoW amd i see a lot of people care this and that to retail. What are you referring to when you say retail? I'm assuming just buying a single player game? But I thought this has always been online?
---

Hunter is way quicker for leveling. Paladin will win the survival game, but the leveling process is very slow as you will be mostly auto attacking.
---
Killing rag atm is 98% about having enough people that no-lifed the first week levelling.

Everything is a hunter weapon or item, just how the cookie crumbles. Hell I’ve had hunters take items with nothing but spirit on it which led me as a priest to ask the actual fuck they were trying to do?
---
I love how the people are literally trying to justify the “roll need for gold” argument by saying “well other people are a piece of shit.... so I’m going to be a piece of shit.”  Then guess what, you’re right. You are a piece of shit and if classic plays out like Vanilla then you should get black balled. BoP, BoE, it’s all irrelevant. People are in the dungeon for loot, not gold. You “need” an item that your character NEEDS as an upgrade, you greed on an item that you would vendor/AH. It’s called GREED people. Your lust for money is GREED. I quite literally am perplexed how anyone could argue any other position.
---
And yes, back in the day, if you were a ninja, and you were that 5th person that “rolled need” when everyone else rolled greed.... guess what, you got put on ignore lists, had the situation explained in trade/city chat, and probably had people gripe to your guild. Then you would most likely have your guild chew your ass out and/or give up that BoE purp that you were hoping to get rich on. If you didn’t then you were getting the boot and you better believe the guild officers were passing on that info to your next guild. Reputations followed characters. Enjoy your re-roll when no one will take you to a raid. Hope the 100g was worth it. 
---
Just saying. Make Classic Great Again
---
You probably haven’t even bought the skills for sword. Go to Undercity and talk to weapon master.
---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
Iv been selling light leather to vendor. Medium leather sells for 10s, however im able to sell it for at least 18s on the AH (and thats cheap)
---
So deff worth looking into it! :)
---
Damn it feels good to be single in 2019
---
Nope, you can't do stuff like that.
---
It was the same in Vanilla though. A full BiS from Naxx char destroyed a fresh lv60 back in the day.
---
My hunter used that for far too long in Vanilla because I was a big believer of attack speed over damage.
---
I prefer this to questie BUT sometimes it doesn't update when I've turned in a quest (like it'll still show the gold ? on the map). 
---
The different colored dots for quest stuff is golden, and then letting me know what level I should be when I go to do the quest is a great help to.
---
it adds dps...but it won't stop you from completing your objectives.  Engineering is mainly for pvp, and for fun
---
Yep
---
If you are in the same household, nobody will even notice. That said, yes. Bans have happened for this
---
Do you expect them to run 3 competing MMOs?
---
I got one of those free armor upgrades. I now head to Goldshire and give away line bags to  lowbies
---
I play wow on my laptop at work and at home so I cant see how they will know the difference. It will suck when you or your friend want to play together and one person will have to leave the account and start another
---
bullshit if you have all of this memorized. You couldn't even get your initial corrections statement correct as you were wrong on multiple points.
---
Big yikes.
---
Ideally people ruining others games is not the norm though.
---
I like all the options lol.  I would love to play bc again just to rematch muru and just having better balance and I like arenas. 
---
Classic + would be cool with side grades.  So you cleared naxx and you got all the best gear for the one min/max spec?  New raids that focus on the lesser used specs to buff them with gear.  Want to be a boomkin?  Enhance sham?  Ret?.... forget that last one, there is no hope but get that gear in the new raid and actually become optimal in that spec to raid with.  Only problem being where do you go from there just another raid that you don't actually get upgrades... you just get fun toys or something or cosmetics.  That could add to changing up how battlegrounds play at the very least.  Could be fun but I see that as a slow death with nothing more to do really.
---
Wow2 they could implement the best of both worlds and actually recreate that classic feeling again as no one will know anything about the quests... the dungeons... the raids... some crazy attunements you have to search the world for too figure out just how to get into a raid.  Good community stuff to figure everything out.  I would like one of the first options before wow2 though.  Either one or do both... classic + then bring bc then do wow2.  They all have appeal.
---
It's not the forsaken. They're actually the underdogs in the story. Their race can't procreate, they're attacked by human and scourge alike, got a Worgen problem, and not even their allies trust them because they used to be scourge. So they play smart, and try to make the most of their diminishing resources.
---
Protip:  Open with ambush.
---
That notification isn't distracting at all! Never understand why streamers do that.
---
It's really not that popular. Most played horde goes warrior, shaman, then mage, in that order.
---
That only seems to work for stuff like collect 15 centaur bracers in the barrens, whereas a specific named quest mob's head drops for everyone in the group.
---
If this is that guys' fucking face again, it gets posted every single day.
---
Always need boe epics, unless you know the people you are playing with. 
---
It doesn't matter if someone can use the item. They can always put in an ask to be given it if they lose.
---
Epics are simply worth too much gold to allow someone to ninja easily.
---
Any word on how long the transfer took? looking at doing the same, but really just want to play...
---
If anyone here remembers Reckful, he was banned for account sharing for nearly a decade. Can’t remember if he was unbanned or still banned.
---
Yes, people get banned for it.
---
It's dogshit for any spec.
---
*laughs in Demonic*
---
He could've uninvited someone to invite you. I've done that plenty of times before. Most people who aren't shit at the game will be quick enough to kick someone and invite you instead.
---
I find it really easy to generate threat actually. 
---
Simply play a class that isn't a tank and just unload on the mob and boom, instant threat!
---
Jokes aside a lot of the tanks I've grouped with have asked us dps to wait a couple seconds before doing damage so they can get some threat.
---
***Caught in the undertow intensifies***
---
Your mother-in-law's overpower hits you for 1337 (critical).

You go to the BBQ.

That's cool!  I had a person I randomly grouped with for a quest send me a thank you note and a couple of scrolls of wisdom the following day.  I thought it was cool as could be.
---
Roughly 1/100
---
Thanks for the silver, sucker.
---
Might want to go holy around 50ish just to make healing more enjoyable and easy but otherwise yeah shadow priests can heal fine for all 5 man content.
---
Freedom Dividend OP!
---
That is exactly how I'd win or how I'd lose lol. I fucking hated rogues. I spent so much time dueling outside of Orgrimmar and getting furious during BGs. Howl of terror was great and I had my fear down to whatever the lowest cast time was. My only hope and prayer lol.

Go afk in the water, character sits when you &lt;AFK&gt;, a gnome might all of a sudden find oneself trying to breath water.

The real question is if the Talisman of the Binding Shard in the loot tables.

Had queues before they upped the limit so still healthy high population.  Thought I'd add that.  No queue most of the time though and very short if there is.

Download is pretty useless if you can't login isnt it

It's not the best weapon in the game. Currently its bone reaver's edge for everyone but shaman

20-25 is within 15-25?

It will never be worth more than 50g.

Your realms discord is a good option.
---
the fuck?
---
It isn't like a warrior taunt though where it forces the creature to attack the user. When people say taunt they generally mean like a Warrior taunt.
---
I mean maybe, but I don’t think anyone’s really keeping track of the bindings, rather the first full Thunderfury.
---
I sometimes stand in front of an escort quest. Just as I'm about to start it someone comes running. I invite them to a group. They don't accept but keep running to the mob until they stand in front of it. In that moment I click accept. Then they suddenly accept the group. 
---
Well sucks for them, Escort quests can't be shared.
---
seems to be working as intended
---
id rather spend time with her! she’s my best friend
---
Take your first guy to 60 without it. Immerse yourself in the adventure. Then pat yourself in the back and spoil your alts.
---
The apothecary society is a means to an end. And that end is preventing the forsaken from dying out as they can't procreate.
---
You shouldn't really ever *win* as warrior up until, I don't know what point while leveling. Maybe ever?
---
Warlocks just have like 2-3x the ehp of an equal level warrior while still doing similar or higher dps, and at range.
---
but hey if you can slip one past them anyway that's great.
---
Only if you dropped out in 8th grade and can’t read 9 letter words.

Do you own the mining nodes? How does one steal a resource out in the world from you?

They slaughtered his entire tribe and dug up his peoples ancestrial burial grounds
---
Echo islands are located south of Durotar, if guess those in the north could be the broken isles instead (I assume you meant those anyway).
---
I don't think the whole concept of Pandaria was a thing before they actually started developing MoP. And after all MoP starts off by stating they found an unknown landmass, hence it would be weird to already have it cartographed.
---
I think this is Kezan, home of the Bilgewater Goblins.
---
You have done well serving the horde I guess?

Warrior here. I lose 90% of the time. :(

Personally I would take it.  800g this early in the game is amazing to have.

Sure they might sell for more in the future but gold will be more inflated.

Like really. That simple. Comments get made about everyone for everything under the sun. You arent special. The more you react, the more it happens.
---
I wouldn't mind some content from BC making it's way into classic. Caverns of Time, Karazhan, Hyjal, Arenas, all retuned for level 60 of course.  
---
I don't want them to open the Dark Portal and allow any outland content - especially flying mounts - into classic.  
---
Hell, TBC was tuned so that everything is accessible without flying mounts. If they ever absolutely had to release TBC, they should just do so without flight.
---
You are taking the screenshot out of context. This was taken when the server was still locked to transfers only. Meaning the only people who were there were people that transferred. Once it’s open it will fill up overtime. 
---
In terms of population any “medium-high” server is fine. Blizzard already said that the amount of players on a medium server is already more than vanilla so you can still have a good experience.
---
And my axe!
---
Engineering is big for pve because of goblin sapper charges and arcanite dragonlings (if your guild is hardcore enough to stack them).
---
Why does the “auction” portion say unknown? Is it similar to Auctioneer where you have to manually update/run the AH to scan all the items?
---
I dont, im a healer, a greedy bastard and i want my loot first, so i host non-caster runs and there isn't a more salty player than a rejected mage : "Good luck whit ur 2hr runs" "You are funny, do you know mages do the most AoE damage in the game?" "You are greedy" "I dont want ur shitty loot anyways (links +frost dmge item)"
---
I thought that was Burning Steppes

I used to get caught by GM's atleast once a week in old ironforge, IF airport, Hyjal, Emerald dream,Deadmines outlands &amp; old outlands. only once or twice was it ever anything more than a "Hey I know you're just having fun looking at these cool places but you aren't supposed to be here".  
---
GM's also used to just be dudes who loved the game and not general customer service, so who knows how things have changed.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by the rare one? If your traveling longer distances a mount will get you there faster than Aspect of the Cheetah; plus if something hits you on a mount you aren't instantly dazed.
---
I never truly appreciate Barrens chat until we get highlights like these from alliance
---
I give up
---
Ok thanks I’ll give that a shot (pun intended) 😀
---
I remember reading that warriors have a 15% chance to miss, but I must have misread it. Seems more like a 15% chance to hit.
---
I purchased a bird from Booty Bay and I am very satisfied with it.
---
I cannot recommend putting anything into prot while leveling.  You don't need it before 60.  One thing Vanilla made 'easy' was being able to level with a leveling spec.
---
What you want is to get *enough* threat, and then worry about the tank's most important job - keep people from dying.  Find out if a mob is patting nearby, get the mob in the right position, etc.
---
To get enough threat, there are some options.  You can charge in if it's safe, and use thunder clap, then switch to defensive.  Otherwise pull with a ranged weapon and either tab &amp; sunder, or use demo shout multiple times.  I should say that I haven't tested how much threat demo shout gives on official servers, but it's been a favorite for the past year at least.
---
Get yourself a macro that goes
---
/cast Revenge
---
/cast Shield Block
---
/cast Sunder Armor
---
but don't include Heroic Strike.  That's only for when you have more rage than sense.  When you get Execute or Mortal Strike, you can throw that in there.  (Mortal Strike is excellent even if the mob will never heal).  Don't feel the need to use a macro all the time - it's simply easier to spam one button if you're looking at your teammates rather than yourself.
---
That's the joke...

Typical after party

I disagree. The art direction in Classic WoW is utterly superb and they have gotten farther and farther away from it the longer retail has gone on.

---
Where is the best area to grind silver and iron veins for mining (horde).
---
Ret is D tier in PvP, and Arms Warrior is S tier in PvP. 
---
If you're asking which is better, I'm afraid you have a lot to learn
---
Retail is the current version of the game, with the expansion Battle For Azeroth.
---
They'll remove layering but the queues won't last. Player population isn't going to to stay anywhere near the current levels.
---
Lmao
---
Yiked
---
When they implemented the new character models for example, it also affected the original models because the helmets had to be refit to the new models, making the helmets no longer fit as they did on the old ones.
---
Environments also didn't necessarily update 1:1 with the original, newer assets might have varying collision objects and otherwise might not fit together correctly as they once did.
---
Places like Stormwind that were updated were basically recreated because of how it was built originally.
---
God I hope this is it. I don't have characters on either because I was travelling the week of launch, but I've been just goofing around on toons for the last week waiting for the server issues to get resolved so I could play with my friends who're on Whitemane and Fairbanks without a queue.
---
But now they're all too scared to move and I'm just hoping those servers balance out soon so I can start from scratch with them T__T
---
Nah fuck that. The undead are smelly and gross and belong with the other smelly and gross people.
---
The night hold hunter set looks great imo, but to this day I’m still so confused on why they made the hood so strangely shaped
---
Heh well don't worry, other classes only tend to remember the times we come out of stealth and wreck them... there are plenty where it doesn't work out, as well as the work you often have to put in to get where you need to be and *get* that stealth kill. Makes the times you win much more enjoyable though!
---
Just do pushups while you're in the queue. #rippedaf
---
Was healing a Gnomergon run, had finished it and were going back to get quest items for others in the party. See a train of dark iron dwarves running down the ramp at us. Don't know who aggroed them, don't know where they came from, just knew we were supremely fucked. 
---
Noticed I wasn't in combat yet. Immediately hearthed while watching the rest of the party die in seconds.
---
As long as they are all melee it might as well be one for my mage .
---
The only hard parts were things that could be screwed up by very few people not paying attention. Thaddius could be a problem because a single person could kill everyone. As long as only a handful of people needed to know what they're doing, like tanks on 4h, or MCs on Raz, it could be facerolled.
---
Oh boy thank God there's an addon so I don't need to activate my brain!
---
Ask a druid, if anyone knows it's them:)
---
Best weapon for Paladin, by far.
---
It's significant relative to the effectiveness of each race. Very significant.
---
With that said, you should have minimal problems with raids not wanting to take a dwarf warrior, except for the top few percent of guilds. If you're not a hardcore raider it won't matter.
---
So if you admit that it's fun and are "obviously" going to do it, how can you criticize it being a part of the game?
---
Depends, a normal loot quest, 2 people works really well. A bossdrop? 5 man because everyone can loot.
---
Busy zone chat is my jam
---
Not sure what you want me to link. I uploaded the photo and added the text and ordered from posterburner.com

What wep is the upgrade at 32 for ally?
---
This. So much. Not a day went by during my stay in Westfall that chat wasn't a full blown war about DM vs VC. Yet what dungeon is in Westfall? What else could DM possibly mean in Westfall? Pissed me off so much.
---
Try to find a guild that specifically states 18+ members. I find most of the time they tend to be (obviously) more mature, but they also tend to not be as super annoying towards women. Lots of times its just young kids/guys just being... well, young.
---
Ally version is Duskwood. Got some humdingers rolling in that chat.

Typical horde honestly. Guy is 2 levels below be questing in the same area, fine, I just do my own thing. Then another dude randomly shows up 10 mins later and it’s 2v1. Now suddenly when they have the advantage the gang up on me. Yeahhh
---
It depends. For example, if I'm having the quest and you are not, then my quest items will spawn after you looted your own mobs. And then I can loot your mob for the quest item.
---
If we both have the quest, I will get items from my mob and you from yours.
---
ok you targeted him how do you talk to him...
---
That level 20 enh sham feel.

As a warrior I am desperate to group up for literally anything that breathes

Yeah. It was a Druid that rez’d mankrik anyways because obviously he only had one.
---
You won’t have any issues, humans are just better for their specialization for swords/maces. Unless someone’s just being petty you won’t have issues
---
Ahahaha this is fantastic.
---
You get 10 min res sickness, which is like, you basically can’t play the game at all. 75% minus attributes and armour etc.
---
This is on classic servers tho, you absolute fucking mongoloid pile of garbage
---

---
No *

What precipitated this?

I got a lot of gold in my 30s by farming beast(skinning) and running SM. Didn’t do much questing 30-40

Alright, I was planning on lvling to 20 in Westfall and only do dungeons after that.

I feel your pain lol.

There are other ways to do it, but its important to stop your pet attack so combat drops. You win  PvP encounter by maintaining distance. If the trap fails, use Intimidate if beast or Scatter Shot if marksman. Wing clip is amazing. Once get far enough, concussive shot and kite.  
---
Learn to use Aspect of the Cheetah in combat. To kite melee or between a caster's spells.  
---
Strafe and jump shoot. All the tools in a hunter's kit are only supplements to moving efficiently. If you don't know what strafing or jump shots are, or how to do them, send me a message I'd be happy to teach you.
---
Just pull two each
---
Can you elaborate?
---
The way it was phrased almost seemed like they maybe wanted to download it before subscribing, because yes you need it to play but not download the client in case they wanted to for their own reason.
---
Ah, that's a bummer. Oh well, not like I'm super hardcore or anything.
---
Because there hasn’t been a drop on the server that has been on the AH
---
As a warrior, I’ve noticed you basically cannot. There have been some mobs where it does apply seemingly, but I haven’t noticed a pattern between the mobs or anything. Your best bet is to use terrain like falling off small hills or getting around a group of trees to buy yourself AA reset time.
---
You dont stance dance while tanking. Def stance generates the most threat. Demoralizing shout is a really good aoe threat generator also
---
Low chance, better to MC him and buy it
---
Can confirm, am 420 ilvl without any raiding or mythic + grinding. was all from trivial 100% success rate content. The hardest part was arena skirmishes for some honor to get my free wellfare conquest weapon.
---
Not saying it is right or wrong. But ses it is. You turn it into quite a bit of gold. Wich is an upgrade depending on what you spent it
---
That functionality was added when they added Dire Maul, iirc. I'm guessing they would add this later.
---
I feel so silly now. I didn't even know that was a thing. I'll try to google some details but thank you!
---
My charge bugged and I couldn't charge when we weren't in combat because I was tanking. I asked the group why I couldn't charge and he says something in the lines of "because we were in combat you fucking idiot LOL". We weren't in combat because none of the mobs were moving or doing anything. We went back and forth for a few minutes, then he stopped healing me and let me die 2 times. Our shaman then ressed me and we kept on going with the dungeon until we killed Herold. After the dungeon was done he left our group I /waved him and he pm'ed me that.
---
Ooooh nice! Even better :)
---
Ah yeah.
---
I was running SFK last week and we were on the last boss. Suddenly, I was standing outside the Keep, unable to move. Then my screen blinked again and I was back in the boss' room. 
---
Tank was dead, 2 DPS were dead. It was just me and the last DPS. We managed to kill him, but they were like "Dude, heal"
---
I'm sorry, I got banished for about twenty seconds and this tank is way too underleveled to begin with.
---
wouldnt be vanilla without barrens chat
---
First and foremost, to each there own. Their bar, their setup.... but ya that was my first thought after the hilarious roll button.
---
I get the intent behind this quest and it’s fun to buy and trade these but man the bag space is stupid. There should b like a page album or something.
---
It acts like a fog of war so that you can't see mobs and players until you get a certain distance to them. This is very important for the game difficulty and pushing out the fog would break that.
---
Hi, /u/supernom
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d0qt1m/this_is_what_we_have_learnt_about_classic_so_far/). 
---
Honestly, the only thing I liked about Cata over Vanilla for example was that it was faster paced for combat. Let's agree leveling a Paladin is boring as fuck in Vanilla. Also the fact that all specs were viable to an extant compared to like Vanilla Boomkin.
---
Onslaught Girdle \*kreygasm\*
---
If course it's a fuckimg Gnome...
---
I didn't know navy seals had valedictorians for most badass.
---
That's illegal!!!!
---
You have an imprecise understanding of retail to say the least.
---
Some of your grievances are valid in principle, but the severity that you express them with does not reflect reality.
---
For one, weapons cannot even titanforge in BFA lmao. The highest a weapon can roll is +10 (means even the highest forged weapon from heroic eternal palace is worse than a baseline mythic eternal palace weapon).
---
The other very important pieces of gear (azerite gear) can't even warforge to +5 ilvl.
---
Even if the above wasn't true, the odds of getting a +40 forge (and you would need something like a +60 forge from a world quest to compete with mythic gear) is extremely low. It would happen to 1 in 1000 players on a relevant piece of loot. 
---
If you were interested in being less dogmatic, you could simply peruse the gear of players on warcraftlogs and see that the prevalence of world quest gear that has forged on characters in mythic raiding guilds is very, VERY close to 0%.
---
Classic certainly has its areas of superiority over retail, but your arguments are so tribalistic that they you are basically a caricature.
---
Skinning was great for a while but honestly now its pretty bad. Mats are worth fk all atm. I think holding onto them for a couple weeks is the best bet.
---
I don't know what you're reading but this entire thread has pretty much spawned out of bewilderment that people use anything besides Discord
---
Then yeah you are going to want to wait until you are at least almost level 17, you can be level 16 and close to level 17 and level up in the dungeon, and you might want have to run it two times but normally you can just run this dungeon once and get everything done. 
---
The dungeon is very easy and as a Priest your job is just to simply heal your butt off and make sure no one dies.
---
You won't really be running another "Dungeon" again until Gnomer as a human. You are best off leveling all through Westfall and at least start doing Red-Ridge quests, as a Priest you can't really do all the quests in RR but you can start them. Once you do a few quests in RR you are going to want to visit Iron Forge, through the Tram below StormWind. Once you get to Iron-forge you can follow the quests around all the way to Loch Modan, finish Loch Modan, then travel up North towards the Wetlands. Once you finish the wet lands you will be just about ready for your next dungeon at Gnomer.
---
You got a lot more after that so I won't go on :P.
---
[I'm not sorry about tagging this mob.](https://youtu.be/aANF2OOVX40)
---
Lol damn
---
Ever since classic launched, I've downloaded all my add-ons through the Twitch desktop app. It's always worked great. But in the last week or two, I go to launch the game and it freezes on login screen and completely shuts down/restarts my computer. I've tried just about every update, repair, reset, I can think of. I have a feeling it's a corrupted add on file. Anyways, if anyone has any suggestions or something I'm missing please let me know. Thanks
---
I keep things I want to keep in the bottom so that the junk fills in and there is a barrier between the two unless I overfill
---
Yeah but I had to grind for forever to get my pre-raid epics. I was a DK and did my daily heroic every day which took hours just to PUG a group for in trade and saved up the like 30 or 40 Emblems of Honor to get the tier 7 gloves, then the like 60 or whatever Emblems of Honor to get the t7 chestpiece. I got as much of the gear as I could from the heroic bosses. Then I got invited to a raiding guild and did my first ever raid which was Naxx. I remember how nothing mattered more than getting tier tokens and getting my set bonuses. When I won the t7.5 shoulder token I lost my shit.
---
Every little piece of gear was super gratifying at 80 in 3.0, and then Ulduar was PHENOMENAL. Released at the beginning of that summer and my guild were all best buds at that point from the 3.0 progression. Progressing through Ulduar was a beautiful thing.
---
Then 3.2 happened and everything changed... you didn't need to progress your gear anymore, because daily heroics could be queued for with the Dungeon Finder and after a couple weeks you could have t9 gear. You couldn't get the full set from emblems, but you could jump from iLevel 200 heroic gear to t9? The fuck? And the new heroic dungeon gave gear with item levels better than my Ulduar gear? And the raid felt like shit.
---
Everything went downhill after 3.2 progression wise.
---
It’s worth it, dude. 
---
I came back from a round and had like 1/8th of a bar of rested XP!
---
Depends on the size of the pull. Anything more than 5 mobs I find spamming shouts to be better than sunder.
---
If you want an idea of how important weapon skill is, the best gauntlets in the game until TBC are [These](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards).
---
I wish Chuck would appreciate me as the son he never had
---
Couldn’t they just make it so everything except mobs and players render then without it, it’s a shame cos some Zones are beautiful but I feel I can’t appreciate them.
---
Niiiiice :)
---
I think there's only a command to equip which then puts your other weapon in your bags.
---
I'm having a lot of fun questing in zones 3-4 levels below me so I can do 5-6 mob pulls. 
---
Owl pet -&gt; pre-pull explosive trap -&gt; mount/pull mobs to trap -&gt; sic pet with bestial wrath-&gt; multi-shot -&gt; feign death + explosive trap macro -&gt; volley -&gt; multi-shot
---
The FD+2nd trap part is only needed if your multi-shot pulls aggro and the volley/2nd multi-shot won't kill the mobs. 
---
You will 100% be OOM after this though and your pet very close to dead.
---
Here I go downloading again
---
I tamed mine fighting 2 alliance for him.. they shot at him to get agro and brake my taming.. i used threatening shot and they couldnt get him of me again.. still have adrenaline rush after 35 min :)))
---
If you engage in difficult content (even some not that difficulty) in retail the social aspect of the game can actually be superior to vanilla.
---
The bond that I have made with a few internet friends over the years of mythic raiding has far, FAR exceeded the trite social pleasantries that people crave from classic.
---
The game is definitely more anonymous if you just queue for trivial content 24/7 though, you're not wrong.
---
Standing on the shoulders it should probably take only 2 to be equal to a human.
---
I use Questie, extremely useful for quest progression information, though a few quests I’ve noticed were not displaying properly on the map, but the devs are improving it daily.
---
Paladins are just annoying, bubble + dispels + longevity. 
---
Warriors are complete wrecking balls if they "catch" you and get hamstring on you. When that mortal strike burst + debuff hits you and whirlwind... bleh.
---
Ohh the mount speed is 60%? And the epic one is 100%? I see okay good to know. So it’s even faster than druids cat with swiftness right? That’s like 40%?
---
I used to be terrified of it when I was young. Now, I pick fights with level ?? players like an angry chihuahua. I beat a ?? Mage once thanks to him missing a Counterspell!
---
Yeah this has been my experience for the most part too. Although one guy politely declined once because he said he wanted the solo exp. I told him we could kill double as fast with two people, giving same amount of exp per hour, but he wasn't having it.
---
Ok funny man
---
I feel you. I just use my ignore list :)
---
My worst experience was one I was raiding (this was wotlk naxx) and I was trying to explain to the other priest how to use mind control. Someone in vent said "whatever, I don't care if we wipe. Just keep talking so we can keep fapping".
---
If he kicked someone to invite the guy that got the tag he's even more of a dick than lying about being full tbh.
---
Maces are only good once Naxx rolls out, some groups will farm trash there and rogues go for double Servo Arm.
---
Guys recruiting :)
---
I gave you Karma, nerd.
---
Is that a benediction?  Fuck im still lvl 30
---
Hey y'all!! Look at Mr. Madeoutofcopper, over here!!
---
14 AP is 1 dps increase. You are actually fucking retarded dude. Unless your base white hit dps is over 300, that 40 AP is going to be more than a 1% dps increase while 1% crit is not an increase dps gain/loss. This is just white damage. Doesn’t apply to the boost from windfury or anything like that. This isn’t even new knowledge. Stat priorities for classic are all over the web and more than figured out. 
---
Can you please do a small amount of research before you come on here spewing that bullshit. Some people here are new and may read your shit thinking it’s true and spend their time and effort pissing of rogues while building their character wrong.
---
I asked a simple question and i get weenies like you tryharding in the replies
---
What
---
Sure! Thanks much!! Honestly, since the last fall out with BV5, I’ve just given up on even using discord or anything. Lol
---
If they are leveling enh, yes it would make sense.
---
Buy a wow subscription. You get both classic and retail.
---
Oh god I just remembered the pvp quests, aka 6-8 5 man groups camping a flight point on the enemy island looking to tag players as they landed to get 25 kills for a high ilvl item.
---
What addon are you using to get class-colored names in the Who search please?
---
Too lazy.
---
Oh hey that's me again!!!
---
That's what I did, now how do I get the retail and classic?
---
The talent itself gives near constant frenzy...
---
;)
---
But it’s not in the game. And blizzard likely does not pay attention to Reddit.
---
I did that the other day and killed another hunter. I panicked when someone dropped mobs onto me that way and ran. They ended up on him when they de-aggro’d me so I went back to try help, couldn’t make it on time and we both died. I felt like such an ass. He was definitely justified in calling me whatever name he did.
---
Cheers, I'll give it a shot.
---
Both, retail still has both too.
---
Install battle.net, select wow, then select version.
---
Drown in the water.
---
Gets even more creepy when I say that.
---
Look I'm not saying I'd bang a centaur lady but I'd sure as shit hold their hand
---
Rightfully get scared fine. That’s fine. Rightfully get scared of something that doesn’t exist? Fucking wild.
---
R/iamverybadass
---
I'm finding most items that will have a ton of value later (black lotus, high end herbs, arcane crystals, mooncloth) are super inflated at the moment. 
---
Mooncloth is 50g right now...
---
Thank god for that TLDR
---
Me and the boys made the move to AR and it's a little under populated. Really hoping it fills up.
---
u/xethra is a BEAST
---
34, the RFK quest sword, and I think either 36 or 39 is the SMC quest sword.
---
Haha, right? I wrote that spell off as a waste of silver.
---
Ok Internet, I want to see a Deepfake of Owen Wilson's face on a Human wow character saying WooooWWWw. Make it happen.
---
simple mind with simple questions yeah i get it
---
Because the base frenzy talent procs so often (from crit without broken tooth) that the players testing it only saw marginal if any increase.
---
For min-maxing, humans are better in pve. But if you're happy doing 2% less dps then dwarves are totally fine.  They're the best pvp race anyways.
---
\#WARLOCKGANG
---
What bag add on is that?
---
Why the hell would ptt be that key? I use mouse 4
---
Follow steps here https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic
---
Yea that weapon, probably an axe, club, or sword. Sometimes whenever you right click an enemy it'll make you try to hit with melee instead of your ranged (bow or gun) which would lead to this problem. If you press "p" you'll open up your spellbook, in the general tab there should be an "auto shoot" spell you can drag onto your spell bar and then pressing that will make your character try to do ranged attacks again
---
[battle.net](https://battle.net) is already installed, i selected Wow but it doesn't give me a version to download
---
&gt; never became completely account based
---
I must've missed the option. Last I played it was friend a player and boom, Blizz account linked so they play D3 I know and I play SC2 and they know. Couldn't even slum it on my trash tank without someone occasionally asking for heals.
---
Its an old meme from the early to mid 2000s
---
Think you just discovered an exploit
---
This happened to me for fizzles claw in durotar. Wouldn't accept my invite so I tagged him first, then they mysteriously were able to accept my invite..
---
/r/foundthemobileuser
---
Yup, damn I don't know how I didn't catch that. Thanks!
---
I think Mankirk is guilty.
---
They can't ride raptors either, I'm pretty sure. Also only dwarves and gnomes can ride mechanostiders. No humans or night elves. But I'm not sure if that was changed in later expansions
---
True so the argument is how much DPS value does two additional talent points get you?  i can't imagine it being a huge benefit but some might see a huge difference idk
---
Also note that if you add a character to friends, it won't send them a request. So you can add people even if they don't add you. And you won't know if they add your character. 
---
It's nice because, for example, you can add people you've grouped with that you liked, and add a note so you can group with them again
---
I did not know this about swords and off hand.  I think that is the most confusing thing for me right now. Coming from a class were weapon wasnt necessarily priority. Get a decent staff and call it a day
---
Hope the hydraxian waterlords will as well!
---
It doesn't prevent you from playing the game. You have ways around it. One way is to zoom into first person view and get stupidly close to the NPC to get its click region. Another option is to "/target Npc_name" and use the "interact with target" keybinding.
---
Man I am loving just giving low level casters two stacks of water as I ride past on my mount. Just knowing it means they can play for hours without hating how expensive water is. Being 42 now the level 15 and 25 is a full stack per cast so it's easy as to just slap 20-40 in a trade window.
---
People are Super greatful.
---
I would be yelling at myself, "DO. NOT. MOVE."
---
Just like old times
---
I always thought they start to feel rewarding after 20...
---
Duskwood and Trisfal Glades have these.  I love it especially around Hallow's End.
---
Gnomes and dwarves for me. All those little short legged fucks have Napoleon syndrome so now I slaughter them indiscriminately and corpse camp their bodies.
---
ill try to replicate it then, actually
---
Fox the spelling and check and see if that fixes it. Let us know if it’s worked out.
---
Step 2 listed I don't have, It goes straight to downloading the WoW I don't want. and I JUST bought a subscription for WoW
---
Yes we know us Chinese are full of gaming chairs and hackers.
---
But as a normal wower, we are trying very hard to save the environment.
---
It's a nice and simple addition to feel that the area gives off.
---
You didn't flip out at level 20? That's the single best level in the entire game!!!
---
And then that fifth needs to wait, potentially on his own for a questmob that might be too tough to fight on his own. If I make a group we either all get credit or we all wait together.
---
This is why I stealth and hide in a corner. I can likely take them, but no risks, I just wanna level!
---
I think both have to be installed.
---
Where have you invested your talent points?

It feels like an actual World
---
the reason this MMORPG was the truest of all. BC crushed that. To all those people begging for classic to expand into BC....Fk right off.
---
Layers of course drastically pull you out of the world sort of sadly.
---
Its weird how much everyone is loving Classic atm. but half the population is in it to expand into BC or even Wrath and its going to make my mind explode.
---
arena was the only decent thing in that expac. Transfer it into Classic and have professional teams compete world wide for cash prizes. Fuck arena armor and especially fuck resilience splitting up PvE and PvP gear into two different sets. Man o h man
---
&gt; He could've uninvited someone to invite you. 
---
True.
---
&gt;I've done that plenty of times before. 
---
I don't doubt it.
---
&gt;Most people who aren't shit at the game will be quick enough to kick someone and invite you instead. 
---
Yes, they are shit at the game, and they are shit at life. That's why they decide to kick someone else out of the group to get the quest done for themselves.
---
To return to "done that plenty of times" - you are horrible at MMOs, and you are a horrible little man.
---
yeah no one counts paladins here
---
I'm re downloading again and I don't even see the word "classic' anywhere, something is wrong and the subscription isn't giving me classic

If you account share in the same computer or in the same house they can’t really detect it. If you are consistently having your account log in from two different places that are far apart in a period of time in which it is unlikely you could be traveling back and forth you will probably get banned.

I thought that repaired gear vendors for more than broken gear? And that the cost of the repair is equal to the increase in value so there's no reason not to repair.
---
Let me tell you a story. The other day, my group of 3 and another group of 3 met at Barak. The other group wanted invites, but AFAIK a 6 person group doesnt work for regular quests. All this was hashed out in /s chat. 
---
So the other group leaves, but on their way out, one of my members mentions he already did Barak in /p chat. Essentially hes offering to drop temporarily so that the other 3 can join, and we can all get the head in one go.
---
Of course, the other party never saw that. Just like you might not have seen a similar interaction in this group. 
---
He said party was full, and then (presumably) invited you once a spot freed up. What a nice guy. You sound like an entitled twat here, for not immediately getting what you want.
---
Yea I'm not sure. I do know classic and retail share alot of files so that may be it. Have you tried to restart the app.
---
Idk what server you’re on, but on ours it is almost expected for you to get invites for kill quests. With the danger of dynamic respawns it is almost mandatory.
---
He's got of one the fastest fingers in the barrens
---
I played retail vanilla wow before. We play again because its the best.
---
"Nostalgia" was blizzard argument against bringing back classic. Because its hard to recognize that they destroyed their game. Especially when finnancially they were doing better ...
---
Well you referred to Legion weapons as legendaries when they’re actually artifacts. Heart of Azeroth is no different from them. You’re being pedantic here
---
How do you possibly miss all those zones by 30 unless you're doing nothing but dungeon grinding?
---
Pass Parade.
---
!
---
As far as Isekai goes, it's one of the better ones. The first half of season on anyway.
---
I still had on TBC epics when I started raiding in Wrath. I had my T5 legs until they got replaced by T7.
---
It’s not modern nor is it frustrating. If an AoE Mage wants to clear a dungeon he is more likely to want another Mage + Tank &amp; Healer + Another Mage or Warlock. Mages are more common, and with popularity of AoE I’m guessing there is more of them wanting to go in a Dungeon.  
---
That said, if you make **your own** Group you are free to customize it however you like. There is plenty of single target Mages and you can get Rogues/Druids/Priests/Hunters/ whatever... I’ve seen it all.  
---
Saying it’s annoying that people only want Mages is just as irritating as me playing AoE Mage with a Tank and than getting Rogue/Hunter/Druid who only want to pull 1 mob at a time while I’m sitting there using Frostbolt when my whole Talent Tree is set to AoE...  
---
Point is: find groups that work, don’t try to fit yourself into something that clearly doesn’t and than be upset about it.
---
This is why I play classic
---
Explain what I didn’t get.
---
What level should I start tanking with druid in dungeons? I've read their ability to hold threat across more mobs make them better for aoe clears. I am currently level 32 and just questing with feral/cat and not buying bear spells.
---
You must rise to GM! They will follow you and when they do, you must invite me so I can follow the orders of the one true Matt.
---
Absolutely
---
No it doesn't. If you grind out the Winterspring Frostsaber that's pretty fucking hard earned.
---
Priest with Fort. Everyone can use some more health.
---
If you make a new game with classic features you won’t get retail players and not all classic players either. If you make a new game with retail features you will get a bunch of them but not the ones who don’t want to leave behind all their progress. Obviously you won’t get classic players. If you try to combine the two you will just make everyone unhappy. The best parts of each game as their players see them are pretty at odds with each other.
---
what mouse is it?
---
on the yellow emote line you can see a bit of the next letter, isn't an "i" but maybe tazdyngo
---
Probably Druid for Mark of the Wild. It's by no means the best class buff in the game, but in terms of being useful to all classes/specs, as well as having a long-ish duration, it's probably the most sought after by noobies. You also have access to thorns later on which is icing on the cake. 
---
Can I ask why in the world you'd choose a class specifically for drive-by-buffing though?
---
Oh hey that's my server! Congrats :)
---
We had a hunter who was just using melee and pet the entire run in SM cathedral, he was topping damage so I couldn't say anything
---
Constantly
---
Honestly, it's more about that earthshock and rockbiter aren't enough tools to tank with. If your group has good communication and takes the dungeon seriously you shouldn't have any problems tanking, from a damage perspective, as shaman IMO. Depending on the dungeon, there might be pulls or fights that are too big for you to keep aggro on stuff though.
---
The queues arent bad at all anymore tho
---
On the server I’m on I was getting ganked by some mobs and 2 people passed by me, let me die, then continued to kill the mob after I had died. Pissed me off. If I see someone dying I help them even if it means I lose mana or not getting XP.
---
1. Playing on a pvp server is a whole other experience entirely. Both fun and frustrating at the same time. Wouldn't call it a challenge as you'd be straight up massacred by higher level chars or if you're outnumbered. 
---
2. Many possible ways to make gold - bag numbers/ capacity trivial in that regard. Also wouldn't count on Devilsaur farming - read up on Devilsaur Mafia for more information. Mage is the easiest to rack up gold on: Portal, Food &amp; Drink Service, AoE farming and even dungeon farming. 
---
3. Engineering is alright. For the lols and pvp mostly because of its insanse utility. Also min-max raiding guilds often have raiders take up Engineering for certain content.
---
They'll learn this isn't retail
---
Anyone an idea how often he has been killed yet globally ?
---
That guy’s name is obviously Tazdingo.
---
Coastal fishing of floating wreckage. Tbh I feel like I got a bit lucky with this haul, but it’s the best way to make money pre-40 if you have the patience
---
Thanks! I’ll look around! :)
---
How did you not get destroyed?
---
people run dungeons in hope to earn loot rather than sell it for the same reasons they buy it... i'm not sure why this is so hard to grasp
---
Not surprised at all that nobody budged. All have the same fear about low pop. Thats why they rolled on those servers in the first place.
---
Wait.  That’s possible??
---
Sorry, but as a mage ive no idea what you’re talking about.

Oh forsaken of the lake what is your wisdom

---
Taken right after I got through a 3000+ login queue.
---
If you're on the higher-end of the leveling spectrum for your server you'll be running into a lot more "try hards" looking to mage farm dungeons. You can either make groups yourself, wait for the right one to come along, or level and alt while the rest of us catch up who don't give a shit what class you are. 
---
Definitely agree with your second point though - the amount that people cry for a layer swap in my guild because they're being ganked boggles the mind. We're supposed to be one of the premier wPvP guilds on the server, and we all rolled on the server specifically for PvP. Why the hell are you in such a rush to avoid it?
---
Launch day I did this to a group of 5 in tirisfal, asked for an invite while they camped the spawn and they were full.  As a mage, I used fire blast for the instant tag and the amount of hate that I received for it was incredible.  They whispered me for at least 15 minutes telling me to kill myself and everything lol.  Would do it again.
---
Gnomes are KOS it’s just a rule. I don’t like night elf players.
---
I started in Deadmines! Only had trouble with warrior dps that kept sundering non-kill targets in terms of aggro.
---
i have actually never had this happen and im almost lvl 40 :o
---
Skeram so similar.
---
As a mage you can eat and drink at same time... as any class really..
---
Jade serpentblade? Crafted by BS,  should be 3g or less

I don’t even have trouble finding groups. And I’m a ret pally. Lol

I saw someone named dannydevito say this on benediction
---
It will get more valuable for sure, as everything will as more people get more gold. But that includes you, and having 800g in this economy is worth considering. I would probably take the money, but you could always try and haggle the guy up to 900?
---
That’s what happened 0.01 seconds after getting the picture.
---
Learnt
---
This is mostly my stance.  In the given scenario the tank made clear he's lower level, would appreciate a chance to get aggro, what his mark order were, and thanks in advance for patience.  5ish pulls in, the dps in question was clearly ignoring everything previously stated, and when I asked him, politely to try to go with the stated flow, he told me to "chill the fuck out and just heal him".
---
I responded to this with and reminder that we'd simply appreciate him go with what the tank requested and what the rest of the group was complying with, and he said "it didn't fucking matter and to shut up".
---
When I then asked why he felt it necessary to be rude, he said he was just being sarcastic.
---
While that's quite possible, the context did not seem to suggest this, and in general, sarcasm can, at times, be difficult to discern via text.
---
We went on to clear and it wasn't that big of a deal, but it was this instance, after numerous other very similar circumstances wether in other 5 mans random shit out in the world that just kinda had me wondering what this behavior was about.
---
I'm not looking to change anything, just understand why so as to perhaps gain insight so I can adjust my behavior to better handle similar situations in the future.
---
The Caverns of Time would also be a nice place to start. You can get inside of it, but there are no NPCs and it is missing a lot of objects.
---
Its whatever, just blacklist them yourself. There's too many people like this, part of the making the game more "social" with forcing people to manually lfg means dealing with more elitist asshats like this guy.
---
Rape that thing in bacon!
---
It is automated, yes. 
---
If you simply target another friendly unit you can use the spell just like without any macro. 
---
If you target a hostile and that hostile has targeted a friendly unit you will automatically cast the spell on that friendly unit.
---
Ley staff from SFK is nice as well.
---
Ah it was shift. Thanks much!
---
Aw man... well I'll be helpful to my fellow horde as much as possible nonetheless!
---
People don't level as healers, so it would be their main spec.

Jesus you actually added so much competition to this place. Great going.
---
but people are clearing the endgame not even max level, so im wondering if the proffession is even worth that extra dps or not.
---
Worth it
---
Retail game bad.
---
They are stealing land from the Forsaken, it is like Israeli settlements
---
Well, endgame is where everyone is allowed to experience the content they want to without having a high skill ceiling. You generally don't see LFR-tier players in mythic raids or dungeons. And it's fine to allow different versions of content so that way the players can actually experience it without having to invest a ton of time to get gear for higher tier raids.
---
But regardless, leveling in either game doesn't really teach you how to do raids. If you want to perform your best, you have to do a little more research into your talents or your rotation.
---

Oh wow, I got your attention too.  Well, thanks for all the hard work that your team has put in over the years.  You guys have made a fantastic resource for us to use, practically for free.  I'm just glad to have an opportunity to get to contribute to it.

Gear or rotation possibly. I'd look up the Classic WoW Mage Icy Veins guide and give it a read if you haven't. Could also just skills or talents your lacking. Been a while since I've played mage myself.

You both sound like children

Nice job moving the goal posts

If there's anything I learned from classic, it's that players fishing are not gankable targets.  All enemy players ignore me when I'm fishing.  It's basically an unspoken rule.

---
"I grouped with a bunch of undead for this SM run and all i got was a..."
---
No one knows, honestly.
---
Capability has changed but the methods haven't that much. Going by directx iterations isn't really a good way to measure either.
---
Also DX8 was out in 2000. By 2004 when WoW launched we were deep in to DX8 iterations and DX9 launched soon after.
---
The PlayStation and PlayStation One miniaturization were 1995 and 2000 respectively.
---
So I'm not sure where you're getting this information from because you're off by a decade.
---
Either way, I've written drawing code in direct x and openGL and I can promise you that the biggest advancements have been other tech like lighting, physics, ray tracing, particles, etc.
---
By 2000 most of the groundbreaking tech for textures and geometry were already discovered. Things like level of detail, portaling, etc. Granted we've had plenty of optimizations and tweaks since then, along with huge increase in processing power, but the fundamentals from then are still used today.

You can go to the menu and access key bindings. There's an option to set "Interact with target" to a keybind. Use that keybinding so you don't have to use your mouse.
---
Any specific reason you left or just the queue
---
See, then there is no problem here.
---
Win + print screen = file of the print screen. However WoW has that built in when you hit just print screen.
---
you increased the chance of your guild being the best guild on the server by a lot cuz it's a pleb server.
---
Racials lol - my phone doesn’t recognize it as a word. Sorry!
---
Same thing for frost spells.
---
wtf would you want to waste a hotkey on that though
---
It only really matters if you're purposefully trying to min/max for the most effective race. If you're good at Warrior you'll do better than someone who's worse but playing a *technically better* race. 
---
Other than Gnome, never roll a gnome of any class.

From the article:

&gt;The players in World of Warcraft Classic, at least at present, are  some of the nicest and most helpful in-game acquaintances I've ever had  the pleasure of interacting with, and certainly a lot more welcoming  than the high-level adventurers you'll find in the modern version of  Blizzard's titanic MMO.

Resetting the power creep makes a world of difference. It's so nice to have stats that are easy to understand in your head. Thorns says it's gonna deal 3 damage on hit, you're gonna see 3 damage. No complex armor or resistances involved to figure out why the numbers you see aren't what's on the label. It also makes any increase in power feel that much more significant. I love starting out in grey armor. Because getting a white feels impactful. You just have to compare armor values. Bigger is better obviously. And then you get a green and it feels like the next big jump. New gear gave more armor which was nice but now you know your attacks will hit harder, or you can cast an extra spell than before. These tiny incremental power increases make gear incredibly fun. Especially when you come across an odd piece of gear that isn't simply a stat stick. Although I do wish there was transmog, I don't mind as much because I care about each piece more. Plus vanilla gear actually looks like it's meant to be worn. Weapons suffered the worst imo. The new weapons they come up with often don't even kind of resemble what they're supposed to be. In classic if you get a sword you get a fucking sword; not some brick that doesn't even have a edge on it.
---
4 is about my limit on my lock.
---
I fucking love the community in this game. I don’t mind the quests etc but the relationships I’ve built so far are so brilliant. Blizzard has to keep this community as the focus of all its policies
---
It's actually later used as a rare wolf spawn.
---
Honestly it's like getting a second chance at a first impression for the original crowd. We're doing it right this time, taking people under our wings and dragging people upwards with us.
---
He is mistaken as far as I know. But I'm only like, 80% positive.
---
is it correct. i got flamed yesterday for someone saying why the hell am i opening with smite and not holy fire.
---
HOLY FIRE IS GARBAGE. sure its better to use a longer 'free' cast before aggro, but this also extends every fight by 1 second more.
---
Also i don't recommend opening up every fight wit ha PW:S first. my rotation is Smite &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SW:P &gt; Wand
---
this keeps my mana efficient, fast kill. and i switch between opening with a PW:S or not using it and just throwing a renew out after the fight. if i don't use PW:S during a fight, i end the fight with around 70% health, which a renew will fix up after the fight.
---
Shimmering flats too
---
Oh okay that makes sense I guess.
---
As a rogue, this is accurate...

that's so duskwood, compared to stitches, Dragon and wolverine

While the same rules generally apply to voting on the comments of others, reddiquette states that downvotes should be used for irrelevant comments, not ideas you disagree with. Also, don't be afraid to upvote a comment you disagree with if you think it is furthering the discussion.'
---
How exactly was my comment irrelevant? 
---
Or is it more likely people thought I was being serious, missing the (apparently) terrible joke entirely, resulting in the subsequent downvotes?
---
In my experience, definitely the latter.
---
Is that normal in vanilla?  That mobs not aggrod to you will become so if the player whom they're aggrod to dies?(non instance)
---
grats!!! huge
---
Honestly when a lock or hunter pulls with their pets I laugh most of the time. 
---
Usually as they’re jumping and when they land you see “oh no. Oh god. Fuck my pet no oh god”
---
Then you just see a hundred mobs running at you 😂
---
Not particularly
---
I like the utility and PvP use of Shadowmeld. The priest specific ones aren’t good, but it’s not like fear ward is ever gonna make or break an encounter. It’s nice to have, sure, but I’d rather not have to look at a dwarf as I play for hundreds of hours just for that one rare instance in which fear ward actually mattered. I’d rather play a race I like the aesthetic of.
---
"The dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark"

Another warrior knows the pain of leveling as a warrior. Some things transcend faction.

But it’s not a bear

Anyone who says paladin isn't amazing at pvp clearly never pvp'd in vanilla. I not only got rank 14 (grand marshal Aarondank, stormreaver) but I'm still playing pally today and it just as good as it was before (minus the reckoning stax) I've yet to lose 1v1 and let's just say that includes warriors. Team fights are a bit different, but if we both have a healer, your healer will run oom long before mine does. Pallies are also the best healer in the game for pvp, AND pve, so there's that. Holy pally has a talent that gives them the ability to literally spam flash of light constantly, forever. Never running oom.
---
I played a warlock back in vanilla. This time I'm a warrior. Let's just say it's... different.
---
Ah ok. People were talking it up about how long it takes but I was getting a level per swing up till like 80. Seemed pretty fast to me
---
woo another retail shit post
---
Tanaris is definitely one of those zones I go "I don't want to have to run all the way the fuck down there again, let's knock this shit out." Glad I'm not alone.

---
Fair enough! I didn’t mean to insult!
---
Im going to do the same thing except im also leveling leather working and enchanting for a couple BoPs first. My character is busy
---
there was a group of 2 mages and a warrior camping the spawn for a quest mob waiting for it to spawn. asked for inv and they just said "no, you can get the next one". They were spamming blizzard and whatever spell makes fireballs fall from the sky. I just spammed my "target near and attack with sinister strike" macro standing right where the boss should spawn. I'd declined their invite and used gouge like 9 times waiting the full 5.5 seconds every time when i realllllllly didn't need to. On my way out a group of 3 was going in for the same boss, I joined their group and we tagged the boss away from those other 3 assholes again. 
---
10/10
---
Vhalleon: Bad weather, huh?
---
You owe the guy a bj
---
As cast macros can auto target other mobs, and classic has the updated macros implemented, the following can be used to avoid earth shocking any other mob than the one you intended. 
---
/cast [@MobName] Earth Shock
---
Hamstring? Lmao *laughs in blessing of freedom*
---
Yeah because he probably wasn't going to be grinding those mobs for an hour lol.
---
Also if someone asked me to group and I politely said no and they still pressed the issue I'd probably not have it either.
---
It’ll get better as you get better. Or, in a less douche way to say it, yes, it does. You just gotta find that comfort zone.
---
level 30 for me was when things got better since you get iceblock
---
mages are heavily dependent on talents though
---
So I thought about this a little bit.
---
I can only think about it from my point of view. If **I** was in a group that was full, and **I** left to group with the guy who tagged the mob, and then he said "oh yeah NOW you're not full" I would *immediately* whisper him and explain the situation. Maybe it's just because I'm one of those people who doesn't want to be disliked, it could just be me, but I just feel like if he were innocent of doing anything wrong he would've said *something* to clear it up. 
---
But I got nothin', no response at all.
---
That's my take anyway.
---
You got to start doing some “ this is your captain speaking...” conversation starters
---
for the horde
---
Happened in UBRS once to me last year on a private server.  I just see a party member type "GET OUT" but my curiosity got the best of me.  I kept moving forward and I just lost it when I saw a train of what had to be 50 dragonkin coming through and steamrolling anyone foolish enough to get close.
---
but big ones are nicer
---
Yeah OP is dumb af for thinking Duskwood is 10-30. Lowest level mob there is level 18. Use some common sense
---
If it's obvious than why did you ask ?
---
You are the kind of people we are talking about.
---
Oh I know, I'm powering through it. My main back in the day was a shaman and I didn't get a rogue maxed out until Mist. I had a buddy that played a rogue way back then and once I got around to leveling one I really wished I had one back in the day. Really glad I'm getting a second chance at that haha
---
Thank you for this list going to whip it out on my next tinder date
---
Maybe you should update it?
---
Warrior? Oof...
---
Tanking is always hectic, probably the best role to stay busy with. Things will slow down as encounters become more difficult, assuming your group isn't hellbent on wiping.
---
You gotta pump those Elemental Precision numbers up
---
Well no offense, but I dislike people using hyperbole to criticize things they don't like.
---
Wasn't it always 52? I swear I remember being disappointed in OG Vanilla when I couldnt get the quest at 50.
---
*Laughs in PVE server*
---
Keep SimpleMap.  You just need to enter "/smfade off" and it will disable the fading.
---
Our main tank in MC back in the day was a druid, and at least one of the off tanks.  We weren't cutting edge or anything, but we cleared the raid just fine.
---
Mark of the wild/thorns...that’s some good shit in the wild.
---
Consider me sparked.
---
It's not rude at all. If there's a quest to kill 50 mobs and you leave me after 6 mobs, that's still 6 mobs I got help with, speeding up the quest.
---
A common one is the troll tusks in stv. They spawn so densely. I had about 8 people rolling in and out of my party to get those tusks. No one complained about leavers. You got your tusks? Grats. Good luck on your next quest.
---
It does get better, at level 60 with gear that’s provides +% to hit. But not really before then
---
Peeler still want Vanilla, but there is only so much content. At some point of the game will become stagnant and most players will quit. There's nothing wrong with thinking about the future.
---
This was exactly what I've been wanting but been unable to find. 
---
My level 24 shiftycow appreciates this.
---
Thanks for the tips! Will definitely look into that. I’m in Faerlina.
---
Basically all of the above. What's so interesting to me as someone who played retail classic 15 years ago, bailed around TBC and is now playing again is how much differently people are playing now is how much the community en masse has embraced AOE dungeon strategies and dungeon leveling. 
---
With that said I personally havent been part of a group doing it yet. Rogues and hunters are classes in particular that will just always have a more difficult time puging imo. Any class can single target dps, but they dont bring anything to the table outside of that. 
---
Definitely happy with my decision to roll warrior this time around. Even though theres tons of us it seems like everyone is always looking for a tank
---
Like I said, if you plan to primarily PvP then I wouldn't worry about it. If you're on a PvE server, you might feel the disadvantages in raids. At least you'll have frost resistance for Naxx!
---
I last played yesterday (Thursday in the U.S) all night and it was fine. As of now, I am playing at the same time as I was yesterday. I tried making new accounts on other realms and I had around 150-200 ping, it seems I only get this problem in Stalagg.
---
I agree. The vast majority of the time I decline invites is because I dont want to have to leave randomly for dog/baby/wife/etc.  I do message them and give an explanation though.
---
As others have pointed out thottbot and Alakahzam both had maps that showed where the mobs/quest item spawn. The only thing questie changes is the need to alt tab.
---
Switched over to trolling? You're trolling yourself.
---
2 mobs is already a death sentence.
---
No that was a private server thing that a lot of people included in guide videos, it's not possible in vanilla (or at least not viable)
---
I just did the same thing and we had a great day of playing today. It felt basically the same without the spam and slightly easier to get quests done because of less competition. The realm still felt full, there were plenty of people running around and still did some wPvp too. 
---
When I logged off for the night I checked Thalnos. It still had a queue of 25 minutes at 10:30pm.
---
So personally, I’m very happy with the decision.
---
True, after looking at the census RP and RP-PvP servers seem to be more Alliance heavy, but they're pretty niche.
---

Doesn't dwarves have mace specialization??

not a lot of high level druids around :-/ we were bummed we didnt have one, but luckily we had Tankstatv (lvl 44 druid) buff us outside.

16 Satyr horns takes like 200 kills with 3 people in group. Not even exaggerating

Without question, rogue.
---
Also to answer some of your questions in the Original post:
---
The realm is one week old today. 
---
The population has moved on to medium and I’m guessing we will keep getting more transfers until they stop them, and more people naturally picking the realm too.
---
Was helping my friend get the essences for his whirlwind axe yesterday when some level 32 tauren warrior decides to charge at me for no reason as a mage. I decided to mess with him and just kite him around with improved blizzard’s 75% slow. Then he aggro’d an elemental as he was slowed and I barely managed to kill it. Then I /hug him and he charges again and kills me. My warrior friend and I camped the dude for like 45 minutes as we farmed till he logged off.
---
I think they may be referring to a scenario more like this: they're grinding mobs all the way to a nice, then someone taps the node. They then grind to another node, and said person taps that node, too. That's a douche move, and 99% of people can admit that.

kudos to pulling it off though

There are a *ton* of low level Paladins on my server, but it seems to be that most people give up playing them around level 15-20. Will be interesting to see what class census is like at level 60.
---
Got tired of being corpse camped trying to get into SM the other day. My hearth was on cooldown, so I followed a level 7 lock around one shitting mobs he tagged until my hearth was available.
---
Messaged you here.
---
I like your macro a lot, and I haven’t gotten into creating totally good macros yet but I had some general ideas. What are some other macros you are currently using or thinking of if I might ask
---
I never said I dislike you, but way to miss the point.
---
I can confirm this as both weapons share a Cooldown.

Been seeing a lot of "LFM Sigil of Storm"
---
I did the xfer off of Stalagg to Heartseeker and I had instant regret as every major place was empty. Booty Bay was a ghost town, Took me 3 hours to find one other person for the Stormgarde quest and LFG was literally 2 people looking for a healer for ZF and the other looking for a Mage for the Cath farm and they were looking for maybe an hour before they stopped. 
---
I know it’s literally new, but I didn’t think it was going to be this bad. Before i logged I went to tanaris to quest and there was just one other person and it was a level 60 afk inside the inn.

If things don’t get better or healthier in a week, I’m just going to cancel my sub.

You could say RFK and RFD make the level higher but I agree it should probably be 10-25
---

---
Heh. You’re on a carebear server. You’ll be fine.
---
Tanks are in very low supply in general, and the fact that Pallies and Druids have the reputation of being "bad tanks" (which is really only true if you are trying to push top tier raiding) doesn't help one bit.
---
So.. you knew it was a non issue, but felt the need to post this anyway?
---
Interesting ui
---
Yes it does
---
Is it /startattack macro? If yes: you should use /startattack instead of script
---
Skinning/herbalism on my Druid. 
---
Tailoring/enchanting on my Warlock.
---
Herbalism/alchemy on my Rogue.
---
Skinning/LW on my Hunter.
---
The idea is to level the alts up just enough to max out their crafting with my main sending the mats.  I’ll have to wait until after I get my 40 mount though lol
---
AFK until Tuesday but send me your char name and I’ll hook it up.
---
I would choose skinning for leveling and then drop it once you plan on raiding or PVPing for engineering. As a priest, we need to wait a few second between kill and the 5 seconds to skin fit well into a spirit tap spec.
---
I might have been thinking of WoD legendaries.
---
Naw. The PVP elite plague doctor set is more challenging to get than a lot of shit we have access to in Classic atm and looks better than pretty much everything but the stereotypical class sets. Which it’s debatable if it’s better than them. Cause Judgements great but that Plague set is HNGG.

"Best PvP in the game"... That's clearly your opinion cause its definately not fact.

You sure about that? I called you out for being intellectually dishonest and trying to play it off like nobody cares when this subreddit has practically gone up in flames with hatred over asmongold and streamers in general. Your response is to start trolling? Common man it's ok to admit you were wrong and you don't know how to respond but this is just sad.
---
Blizzard was right: "You dont want vanilla, you think you do, but you dont"
---
Rip

Still ranting. Wow

Quin is gonna top the meters just you watch :p
---
How does a lock do this? CoA?
---
Congratulations! Doesn't appear to be very good though. Oh well. Maybe you can sell it to an enchanter to DE!
---
I feel like you haven't played too many healing classes
---
Some servers were VERY imbalanced
---
To be fair they probably just kicked their fifth before asking
---
LW/Skinning is crazy convenient while leveling. You can always swap later. With LW, everything but your weapon stays caught up easily, and you make extra money from it. Spending a couple gold every 5 levels or so on an updated weapon is a very small cost overall.
---
It's the same as suggesting watching a video on YouTube and not linking the video, linking shit isn't hard either.
---
Lmao I don't remember. I'll send it to you when I log in ~30 mins
---
What would you say, does it take about twice as much? Or how would you compare the two?
---
They don’t look better is the thing though. The slutmogs are really the only ones worth a damn because we haven’t had good slutmogs in ages.
---
I’m a guy but nobody believes that when they hear me talk and based on how I act. Apparently I sound very feminine and am to nice to be a guy. Not quite your problem but I find it funny.

---
calling it bad back then is still simply not true, the axe had good DPS and requires relatively low amount effort to obtain compared to WW axe. The proc is also really easy to cancel if you don't want it.
---
Also really good if you're solo lvling but doing zones 2-3 lvls below your lvl, can easily pull 3~ mobs at a time and just AoE them down. And even if it doesn't proc you won't die to 3 mobs if you're doing zones below your lvl.
---
Wait did you just screenshot and use alt+z but keep your name visible, only to blank it out?
---
200 iq
---
Going to assume this on a pvp server. You do not help the other faction or be friendly. You crush them and make them wish they never crossed your path! :)

Good thing I did that for you then, huh?

BFA Elite Plague Doctor Set beats anything in Classic except maybe Judgement.
---
This addon isn't working for me for some reason. I tried disabling all my other addons and only having Leatrix active but still nothing. Is it only supposed to have 6 files in the folder for it?
---
Because you want to do that putricide wannabes
---
Always a conversation about FDR and/or socialism in Barrens chat on Whitemane
---
And that’s the moment you become „that needy guy“ nobody wants to date
---
do you gain extra xp if youre in a guild?
---
Come do that in the real servers... like stal or hero... not the knock off servers where the weaks migrate too...
---
This aggression, will not stand, man.
---
The addon still exists, I'm using it and it's great :)
---
As a first time mage player starting to work my way down the frost tree, what’s your usual process for juggling 2-3 mobs?
---
Zero light yog is my favorite raid boss in the entire game. Such a challenge and such a cool concept. It just blew everything out of the water up until that point. Ulduar was a beauty of a raid. Too bad the tier sets were ugly as hell.
---
The major difference time wise is that Classic has what I call dead zones, areas in leveling where mobs are a little to difficult with quest rewards that are simply not that good, I’m currently at that on my mage 23-27/28 where I’m spending more time running around and dungeon spamming for classic WoW.
---
With retail however, ignoring the boost it’s actually 110 not 60. You don’t have any dead zones, there’s always enough quests and mobs increase in difficulty relative to your level, granted they’re never that tough.
---
Yeah we should totally get raider.io in here. That will get rid of the elitist asshats. 
---
/s
---
Not enough bagspace!!!!
---
No talent or ability trees, bright aesthetic, and trash lore ruined D3.
---
You can heal fine in 5 mans. But you will probs struggle in cleave grps because u go oom faster than a proper healer, and these grps just want to go fast.
---
im late to the party but THANK YOU.  was driving me NUTS.
---
The adventures of &lt;black smudge&gt;!
---
Yeah like 40% of the specs in the game aren't even used except in the nichest of niche of circumstances. That's where BCs improvements really shined.
---
Guilds will definitely take you. Hell, I created a character on Smolderweb and had a guild invite before I even got to level 2! And I've stayed in that guild through level 25. Fantastic group of people.
---
Just try to enjoy it all while you play. Eventually, after you run a couple dungeons, you'll get the feel for dps and tanking. Some people might be a little impatient with you, but most are really relaxed and willing to help.
---
We'll it won't max it out but it'll get it high enough to actually hit the mobs consistently.
---
I polymorphed a low hp rogue night elf when it was in trouble. Gained it enough health to help.

So instead of one person taking two seconds to explain what the thing they want people to care about is, you want EVERYONE to take two seconds to look up something that might be stupid bullshit (who knows I’m not looking it up)?
---
Background of the story: me and my friends were trying to do some quest in Hillsbrad Foothills but a group of ally players kept killing us, we asked for help in the general chat, and the horde provided some.
---
This is why I play classic it was an awsome PVP event.
---
Sorry about how much free time you have
---
Course, but those super overpopulated servers could still have too much for a single layer, so it's possible you could see a queue returning on those servers when layering is removed.
---
Stop bragging. I'm only 16...
---
Having a job and going to school sucks
---
Good call I just started leveling a troll so that’s where my mind was. Yeah it could be I feel like a lot of Cata stuff they came up with just for that xpac though
---
Kind of I have all 3 talent points in VW and rank 3 torment and I still pull aggro of of it
---
There is no guild exp or bonus exp for being in a guild
---
&gt;  you want EVERYONE to take two seconds to look up something
---
No, I provided the link for you with an explanation. Isn't this what they asked for?
---
From?
---
Jesus that is an ugly ass quest tracker. My god.
---
Roll for a chest in open world? Pretty sure you mean you start clearing the mob and some rando comes flying in and loots it and bounces.
---
i believe so
---
I love my flight buddies!
---
Gz on having skipped a memorable and one of the most enjoyable features of the game: questing.  
---
Kudos to you for having endured the boring dungeon grind but I would rather enjoy it like it was intended and the leveling is one of the major reasons we wanted classic
---
I was doing Betrayal from Within in the Southern Barrens and had killed Lok and Nak already.  
---
After about 10 minutes of not being able to find Kuz, I met a Warrior that was looking for him too so we grouped up.
---
While I was running laps in Ghost Wolf to find Kuz with a target macro, the Warrior was killing Quilboar and died once or twice, but I was happy to rez and heal him up, then helped him with his kill quest.
---
About 3 or 4 times Kuz spawned and we weren't able to get near him before he died, so I took the Warrior to Lok and Nak and helped him kill them and loot their skulls. Finally Kuz spawns while we're in range, but I couldn't get in casting range before a Druid got the tag over my Warrior pal.
---
Queue the Warrior instantly dropping group and asking for an invite, only for them to kill it without him. He invites me back to a group and I decline (feeling petty cause he tried to screw me). 5 minutes later Kuz spawns beside me and I get the tag. Warrior buddy sprints across and watches me kill Kuz as I decline his second invite back.
---
If you can't afford two seconds to type in a search bar..
---
Battleshout is a buff you do demo shout as it gets more threat per mobs then just tab and sunders/rend.
---
If ur low lvl and people attack different mobs its harder
---
Maybe he was full, one left, you got the tag, you declined his invite? Who knows? Anyway, it sounds like something you would see on /r/ProRevenge.
---
It isnt efficient to use ever. Used in raids by a single priest if the tank realy needs it.
---
No no no... Legion had artifact weapons but also had legendary items completely different from artifacts. Also, legendaries and artifacts are different "colors." Artifacts are not the same orange text color as legendaries.
---
I have 3 and still pull aggro of of VW
---
Renew gets +15% healing in a tier 1 talent which makes it one of the more efficient talents, but I'm not sure if the other heals get talents that nullify that.
---
Run it once with the full quest log entirely. Takes a few hours but you get the teleport rod and can spam princess for her sweet juicy 1% hit ring.
---
Or you can just get over it ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Said from a non Warrior Obvi
---
I wish there was a world map of level ranges where you should *actually* go, I went to Feralas at 40 and to my surprise every quest was Orange, I basically couldn't be there as a Warrior. I just went back to south STV. Arathi also kind of really starts at 36, I went there at 33 and could only do like 4 quests total
---
That's just my experience leveling as a solo Warrior though, I'm sure most classes could do the quests I can't
---
I've been doing Scarlet Monestary and RFD and I've not had a healer complain in over 80 dungeons, or had anyone leave the group. I sustain between 260-380 dps on pulls and the packs die before the healer ooms. Not sure what else you can ask for.
---
human mage on retail, undead in classic. and i saw the guys in cages and im like
---
why do the orcs deal with the undead? like orcs arnt really bad people, undead are experimenting on shit trying too wipe out all humans.
---
HMMMMMMM
---
I habe been playing private servers for years, you will get rejected if your gear is not good enough in raids, you are manually assessed by the class leader of the raid, item score is so fast it will leak into dungeons.
---
Skill can absoloutly out wiegh item score, i hope blizzard breaks this add on.
---
I mean it's possible. My friend and I spent 1 day and we got 80 devilsaur leather. It was only like 3-4 hours. Him having 300 is possible.
---
Man just getting into tbc heroics was tricky as a tank. I remember working hard to get the defense cap.
---
Magisters terrace was also not a joke without raid gear. Miss those intense dungeons.
---
Yeah but you leveled with artifacts not legendaries. The legendaries were a separate system from the one being referenced in the post above.
---
wait can warriors not pick up loot? nvm i know they can cause ive played warrior and the complaints about its difficulty are totally exaggerated.
---
Body pull with mana shield, frost nova to freeze in place, blink to distance, improved blizzard 2 full casts and then arcane blast or w/e that spell is arcane aoe spell is called until they're dead.
---
:B
---
Except if you're aoe farming with mages, you pulled too few mobs.
---
The problem is classic wow =/= vanilla wow. Things were much different back in 2004 than 2019
---
Yesh, happened on my first boat-ride too. First I dc'd, then things got wild, once I logged in. I was under stormwind at some point and ended up floating few meters above the sea. Wasn't anywhere near a shore, but didn't get fatique. Couldn't breath above water though..
---
yeah all twenty of them
---
In fact most slutmogs use vanilla and early TBC greens.
---
Wouldn’t that mean retail is better optimised? So technically speaking it should be more enjoyable to level on retail, that said everyone talks shit about retail and everyone seems to love classic. 
---
Is it because classic had a massive influx of players because of it just coming out, and retail been out for 15(?) years and not that many people playing it? 
---
I might be reading more into your words. But it doesn’t really make sense to me.
---
i fell out of the world and got disconnected, i will say that if you have an issue with changing your settings and getting the 'world of warcraft can not enable 3D acceleration' error, this is whats letting me do this
---
See? Literally a perfect example of what I was talking about. Your lack of self awareness is hilarious buddy.
---
Wowee! As a rogue I'll stealth numlock to where I'm going and get a cup of coffee.
---
For reasons that are unclear to me, fury theorycraft really languished throughout all of 2005 and into spring of 2006. All of our dps warriors were arms throughout BWL, for example, in our world top 100 guild. I *think* this is because fury had a reputation as a heavily nerfed spec because it had in fact been nerfed in the beta, after the Indalamar video.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zNFcYZfxjQ
---
Mindblowing footage at the time. Fury was nerfed after this and the received wisdom among warriors for the first year of the game was that it was a neutered spec. It was not until after roughly Patchwerk when people were encouraged to start reading EJ and spreadsheet their toons that the potential of fury became understood.
---
Not hell, just leveling as Warrior.
---
It just seems like such a weird flex. Like, yeah -- you can do it. But don't you notice that literally no one else tanks that way? I don't think you've found the meta, but hey - if groups are inviting you and you're not wiping them, keep raising eyebrows
---
Effectively guaranteeing you only want to dps by the time they come out?
---
Honestly don't see that many warlocks on my server, which is weird.
---
You're not meant to do anything, it just depends on your server's economy and your patience.
---
If you haven't already, find a Gnomeregan group. It's a grand ol time with quite a few quests for alli
---
&gt;Haswell
---
I make it run on my t440 just disabling DXVK
---
just select the game on lutris and click on settings just down the PLAY button  
---
then go to Runner Options and select show advanced options, then disable DXVK
---
Depends on level I guess. The mid to low 20 hunters literally just stood there. But then again there is a sweet spot. Where you cant melee and cant shoot. But yes no class is gonna win every fight if you have no skill. Safe travels.
---
Hahahaha dude go look through our comment exchange. You just completely contradict yourself and are now completely on my side.
---
its stupid regardless if you 'care' or not.
---
anytime you do something that passively or actively hurts you its dumb. like for instance, drinking alcohol or smoking any type of tabacco irl are dumb things to do. they hurt you
---
but weve decided that people can make these stupid choices. (also eating too much fits in to this)
---
the guy under cuts the price because he wants the stuff to sell fast. but long term he loses money.
---
what your trying to say is, not everything has to be min-maxed. and its his choice to decided what he wants to do that with
---
but regardless its still dumb to undercut by that much
---
Plenty of people are tanking dungeons as fury and arms with 2h because it's simply more efficient. I'm not sure who you're playing with but you should try playing with a fury tank, or arms tank if you're over 40.
---
iNtElLeCtUaLlY dIsHoNeSt... Lol. I'm going to bed, have a good night don't stress too much
---
Same. I played a little of cata and wasnt my thing (a little i mean like 10 hours max)
---
But THIS im loving. The difficulty, the feeling that choices matter and the community. Im only going to play 1 month since the raise of dollars just made it too expensive for me in south america. But this has been an incredible experience
---
Rogues
---
I wouldn't be surprised if top guilds end up sharing valuable materials to get their players online faster.
---
Whoever gets it is gonna be threat capped like crazy though for a long time.
---
Nope making an alt to use it on.
---
*Working as intended*
---
Was the opposite for me on Ally. I had to do every zone in the 20-30 range and then every 30-40 zone when I was in the 30s. Quests outlevel you super fast especially 20-30 in Ashenvale and Duskwood, then 30-40 Arathi, Shimmering Flats and Dustwallow/SwampofSorrows
---
Even my bad experiences ended up being funny
---
rite on fuck all the gnomes
---
While being a dick about it and implying that we were the assholes or expecting a link or cursory explanation of wtf the op was talking about
---
Just got on so message me
---
Your entire point was that “leveling with legendaries” was Legion only and you were condescending af about it. I pointed out heart of azeroth and you pointed out it’s an artifact, which I pointed out is the same as the “legendaries” you level with in Legion. The original point is that leveling with an item like that is not exclusive to Legion like you were implying, it’s also there in BFA. 
---
I saw your comment admitting you were wrong before you deleted it too, btw. Stay pedantic though my man
---
This is a good way to both pull aggro and interrupt your mana regen. Dont do this higher lvl in a cleave grp. There are usualy no tanks just dps in those grps.
---
Laughs in frost mage
---
Yeah I don’t have time for that. Cool that you do tho
---
GORILLA WARFARE
---
YOU MEAN LIKE STICKS AND SHIT?
---
FU!
---
That’s true, nobody knew what were the good items. They were barely touching the top of the iceberg when it came to game mechanics. 
---
Now everyone (other then me and those who haven’t played WoW before) knows what item they need at what level to be the strongest/most efficient.
---
I assume that’s why they different?!

BoE have been rolled uponst equally to all members of party regardless. Some BoE are completely worthless and you will grow out of them fast as shiznit UNLESS your twinking. Take the butcher - yea cool weapon but once you finish SM you have a better one from main quest line. Don’t equip it’s a waste - save and hold for phase 2 and sell. Erbody needs a mount/end-game enchants don’t be silly- make it a fair even roll for everybody. If whomever wins it equips it so be it. IT being the thing.
---
From playing vanilla back in ‘04 this was the general consensus- it’s better sold then equipped for the aforementioned reason. 
---
If it’s a higher level BiS blue then well that’s a little different but lower level twink items should be just that. GGWP omgz1337bbq’z #nerdrage#poundit.
---
Shatterspear trolls. You have to be alliance. Theres vids on youtube on how to reach them. Jokerd did this grind on prior servers.
---
What country are you playing in? Have never seen it labeled "Rucksack" before.
---
I have no clue what these other guys are talking about, but they are leading you astray when talking about healing while leveling. Basically all spells you learn from here on out will only get better mana efficiency as you rank them up as long as you have under about 40 plus healing. When leveling you will generally have between 0-20 healing unless you get some lucky drops.
---
There's only really two times you want to downrank until you get plus healing gear. When you want to heal a DPS up, use the rank that will get them closest to 100% without overhealing them. The other time is when you feel you'll be able to get more mana regen out of topping a tank up with no overhealing and casting a renew at the same time then not healing for a while, compared to waiting longer until the tank will have taken enough damage that a max rank gheal won't overheal.
---
When you get a decent amount of plus healing and have the spiritual guidance talent, everything changes.
---
Day 2 I started questing with a NE Hunter who had never played WoW before classic released. Showed him the ropes on a lot of interface and tips/tricks type things. Now we’re guild mates and “racing” to 60. 
---
Its fun, the kind of people you meet when you play a multiplayer game as multiplayer.

---
Pets don't tag things, though?
---
&gt;Hunters have their own fun with beasts.
---
FOr the love of God, please specify more.
---
Back in vanilla I'm pretty sure my guild knew my pet better then me.  I still refuse to use another pet whenever I log onto my hunter on retail.  We've been through too much.
---
Chopsticks and chopstick
---
Happened to me a few hours ago. At least it proced another overpower
---
There are still going to be average guilds with average players who want endgame content in a casual way. They will need all sorts of gear/aid to compensate for the lack in hardcore, skilled players.
---
Hilarious, I'll have to see if it works on alliance.
---
Same. Retail is dead to me.
---
Exactly everyone went into the game blind. Now everyone knows every tiny little detail from the best leveling route to BiS items for each level. I wonder how long it took the first person to get lvl 60 in vanilla wow
---
Oh I think you know.
---
Yeah, it’s absolutely viable. Go 24/3/24. You won’t be topping DPS charts in dungeons anymore but you’ll still do more single target damage than a warrior. For me, the utility this build provides is well worth a moderate decrease in DPS.
---
it doesnt get better until the 50s when we get hit and expertise gear
---
I haven't had someone NOT tank that way, its to difficult to hold aggro as a sword and board. Especially since threat reducing abilities are damn near worthless.
---
I’m in SLU on Westfall horde
---
BFA 1 to 120 takes 3-4 days /played.
---
Classic 1 to 60 takes 8-10 days /played.
---
nope.
---
AHDB does it fast.
---
First of all, I deleted that comment because I had a weird lapse in my head thinking legendary items were in WoD but it was Legion so I was wrong about being wrong. That's why I deleted it.
---
And no. Again. Legendaries and artifacts are not the same. Legion had BOTH legendaries and artifacts. BFA only has one artifact and it's the Heart of Azeroth. Do you not know the difference? They are not AT ALL the same thing. Legendaries are not a thing in BFA.
---
Well i do atleast, i always keep 2 ranks of etiker lesser/normal/flash depending on my level on the bar. And one big heal aswell. But like previous replies stated. Once you get some gear it can be bigger gaps of rank.
---
For example, back in vanilla my most used heal in endgame raids was flash heal rank 1-2 (level 20 and 26 skills) but with enough healing power it was more than enough for most things
---
Because on private servers it was fucked up
---
The Barrens is like 6 inches!
---
I played WoW from '03-'06, with a 2 and 4 year old. I remember them wanting to play, sitting in my lap in the mornings as I drank coffee and farmed herbs for a raid I'd do later that night while they were asleep. 
---
My oldest is now working on getting into the army, streams Seige, mods some game that I've never heard of, and will talk my ear off  about gaming to the point that I lose interest. 
---
The youngest is in his senior of high school, probably playing witcher right now, and just upgraded his PC on his own so he can play better games.  
---
Gaming and parenting can be similar. The day to day grind is not the most remarkable or the most important part. It's the feeling of absolute joy and excitement you get when your group, or family, succeeds. For some reason it's a lot more enjoyable to be a part of something bigger than yourself,  much like raiding!
---
No I really didn't, you're just a dumbass.
---
I never saw that until right now. I always thought it was some dumb dog.
---

---
I mean, you hit the mob with a fat shadow bolt and you are going to pull agro. If I dot up the target and wand I might pull agro when the mob is like 10%hp.
---
Why so little rogues? Aren't they good?
---
Stopped playing after our guild had Naxx on farm in Wotlk and my char basically had Bis in every slot. To be honest, it seems like not much has changed for me. Think they really went a different direction after Wotlk. Loving every second in classic so far. Enjoy.
---
Natural selection
---
Lol who tf dual wields on a war while leveling???
---
classic is a great experience. and the world is fantastic...that being said
---
classic's class design and balance is a little shit. like play rogue in any expansion and then come into classic and your going to want to hurt yourself. various skills, require regents. your missing key skills (like cloak of shadows or sub spec's shadow dance, and many many more) and the list goes on.
---
what ive found is, the world is the best version it could possibly be. while the classes' are subpar in alot of area's. now do they do improve by 40, but that push towards 40 can be hard to deal with.
---
best example, i played aff and destro lock for a long time. like wrath+ in most if not all expansions. when deciding what too pick for classic, i ofc looked into lock. and what i saw instantly turned me away.
---
No unstable affliction or haunt for an aff spec, and no chaos bolt for destro (and soul link is the lvl 40 talent for demo instead of being a basic skill). that right there makes the entire playstyle meh.
---
but this is to be expected, classic is infact just a remake of vanilla (duh). and they improved alot of the classes/spec's over the expansions (too a degree atleast). to make them feel better.
---
they just fucked up the world in the process. which is why were here
---
Warlocks, hunters, and mages are all fun in their own way. Warlocks have a huge toolkit for survivability, hunters have traps and snares galore, and mages crit big. If you're looking at a hybrid class, paladins are just about impossible to kill and bring a lot of utility to groups.
---
Better optimised? Maybe. Easier? Far too easy. Leveling in retail is a chore. Something you have to get done first to enjoy the good parts.
---
Leveling in classic is a journey. An adventure. Sometimes annoying and hard and you'll frustrated. But every time you ding a level you'll feel accomplished.
---
I like how you’re casually dead.
---
For the horde!
---
I’m more wondering how an entire group of them can do this.  Do all 40 of them  or however many people it takes to kill that thing in the guild just not have jobs?
---
To put it simply, retail pretty much hands you everything on a plate. Want a raid or dungeon, press a button and join a queue, want gold easily, click a button and pay some money, gold delivered instantly
---
Want good gear with little effort, click the same button as mentioned above. Don't get me wrong, retail has its perks, but its all just that little bit too accessible for me
---
Classic is almost the polar opposite. Levelling takes a lot longer, I'm about 3 days played and level 33, you can level quicker than I as I have been screwing around a lot. Expect pvp servers to take even longer. Dungeons you need to find groups by asking or messaging in chats, they take longer to do
---
Gold is more difficult to obtain at least initially, even end game and getting your first mount requires careful planning. Nothing is really given to you on a plate and you have to work for it all, it's not for some people I get that. For me it's something that had longevity and a much better social aspect than retail wow and other similar games
---
I mean hes dual wielding at 20...what do you expect from a player like that?
---
I was just giving out tailored armor and bags while i lvled ppl wete so greatful and i even got tips.
---
Ok so you greed like a nice person. Someone else rolls need and you're fucked. I don't care about your wiki explanation, not everyone abides by that, making it useless.

Somehow none of these groups I went fast for complained when they ripped aggro off me almost instantly with AoEs; I've also seen them die a few times and I wonder if that actually makes the run faster in the end than just doing it normally
---
i feel every person who is married or have a GF hates it, as a basement dweller looser im starting to think maybe i got it right after all
---
&gt;Teremus the Devourer 
---
I think he had a high chance to drop blue stuff that would sell for anywhere between 10 to 100 gold, i don't really remember the details other than kiting dragon to sw and profiting some way.

Is it supposed to say gorilla warfare and not guerrilla?
---
On rattlegore from SEA with buds in Cali and elsewhere, OOM BOIZ will welcome you!

I’m surprised many people are saying rogues as well. I feel like I see them everywhere, it could be server discrepancies but i can’t imagine it being that different
---
Aha i see. Whats your fishing level and where is the zone located? I am level 36 hunter,  just managed to go 225 fishing
---
a lot of the icons are really weird up close, and half the time what they really are when i look close is nothing like what my brain tells me they are when they're tiny.

Kargoz has some class guides that are really nice to watch.
---
Bellular just started a patch by patch breakdown of WoW starting with Vanilla that's pretty interesting.
---
Madseasonshow is kind of just a WoW YouTuber in general but he has a lot of great classic videos out there.
---
Punkrat is another one that comes to mind.
---
Frostradamus is also another popular classic YouTuber.

Storm the guild that was retail or a different Storm?
---
You have to think about classing healing downranking like this. Every rank you learn is baseline more healing per mana than the ranks under it. But every heal/gheal you learn after level 20 gets 86% of your plus healing as a free bonus heal, and every renew after level 20 gets you 100% of your plus healing as a free bonus heal. 
---
If you have +200 healing, you'll get that free 172 healing on every heal/gheal you cast. You can get that free healing whether you spend 450 mana on this rank, or 270 mana on this rank. This is why plus healing makes your lower ranks become more mana efficient than your max ranks.
---
When you are just starting to get a reasonable amount of plus healing, it's hard to tell the difference between what will be more efficient, a max rank heal with more out of casting regen, or multiple lower rank heals with less out of casting regen. As your healing gets higher though you will basically only down rank.
---
Completeling quest and watching the effects, i.e. phasing.
---
Or when people are begging for gold, open trade window and put in +50 gold. Then go take a dump or something. They never close the window.
---
Prat will format your chat like the picture and is just a chat add-on rather than a complete UI replacement.
---
Dishonourable kills wreck your rank progress I think?
---
What's the gear requirement difference between a holy priest and a shadow priest? 
---
Is it the same as a feral druid vs resto druid, or enhance shaman vs resto shaman, or is it 99% of the time, the exact same gear?
---
Having interesting mechanics to boss fights and more interesting quests, if they improved those 2 points in classic I think it would be the perfect mmo.
---
Hunters can and should melee things. Mobs dont stick to your pet like glue and it's an important skill to learn for pvp.
---
Holy crap is Duskwood chat terrible.
---
Well I have it paired with herb, so I'm pretty self sufficient,  as well as in a guild that helps each other out when it comes to resources. I've honestly only spent around 30s on the ah for mats.
---
Tracking button wasn’t introduced until a later xpac. You can only use the track/ sense skills. And with that, only able to track one at a time. E.g you can’t track herbs and ores at the same time, only one or the other. Unless you get add ons.
---
&gt;Decide to become the Master of Puppets and had guildies camp the spawn for awhile....
---
Overkill tbh
---
Has anyone tried out Ravager on hunter yet ? The proc is only based on the weapons damage if I’m not mistaken.
---
Also all hunter weapon comments are welcome.
---
I wish they implemented some sort of world buff for capturing a capital city.
---
Or have a giant world capture the flag, where if your side was in possession on the item/relic you'd get a global buff for that side.
---
That was my most "in-depth" macro so far.  The only other one I have is for Disarm:
---
`#showtooltip Disarm`
---
`/startattack`
---
`/cast Defensive Stance`
---
`/cast Disarm`
---
No idea. But honor wont be here until phase two yeah?
---
Welcome to Orgrimmar, have you come to serve the hor-

---
Mad Season is awesome!!
---
It can be, but MC definitely isn't. Plus no content really stays difficult if you've been playing it for years.
---
Dark Souls is considered a difficult game, but once you get good you can breeze through it.
---
If I am questing in an area and a dude starts trying to pull more than he can chew just to fuck me over, I’d let him die too. Not even a Rez for the man.
---
QuestGuru classic and Classic Quest Log for Classic both do this and are currently maintained.
---
"rip"
---
Yeah definitely the boss mechanics could be improved. The retail art team continues to do a fantastic job. Having DKs could be cool. Maybe Demon Hunters if they weren't so over the top. Hunters using focus could be cool. 
---
World quests would also be cool if they weren't a slog. Make less of them and make them hard enough to actually require a group and it'd be pretty cool.
---
See I don't have pretty attack macro I send it manually and I also leave it on passive so I can control where he goes. So I open with pet attack then CoA, corruption, immolate and last shadow bolt or wand depending on Mana. Opening up with immolate will generate a lot of agro before your pet hits the mob might be why you pull agro. Just a thought.
---
Only 39? I‘m 35 and all I do is study for 2 hours max, play wow till late at night/in the morning and sleep. :D
---
No. Don't do this. Don't bring that up or make that suggestion. 
---
It's called "Classic" for a reason, not World of Warcraft: Reborn or Reboot.
---
It's intended to be the old game and that's how it should stay. Many QOL changes you may want will be available via addons.
---
That being said, I don't think anyone is saying that modern WoW has gotten **nothing** right, it's just that for everything it *has* done well, it's done so many more things wrong.
---
Big boss man died in a week. It's like they turned it way down

No, and that's why you should do it anyway.

---
Lots of micromanaging, lack of raid slots, 3 pets max, classic hunters are fast to level but not the best.
---
is that a photo of the screen?
---
I put MotW on anything and everything that runs past me.  I love it!  I really missed buffing people.
---
&gt; Having DKs could be cool.
---
God, no.
---
Well yeah, but civilized people keep it in the bottom right corner of the screen.
---
That's not always true, it greatly depends on just what's going on in whatever pull you are on. In a vacuum, ya renew is not as efficient. But if take out of casting mana regen into account, it may be more efficient to cast your renew.
---
/cast sinister strike
---
Better optimized for leveling definitely, with the cataclysm revamp of the old zones and onwards they had maybe 8 years of quest design experience? Back during Classic they had RTS experience. 
---
Personally I am on the biased side for retail leveling, I have 9 level 120s and 3 level 110’s, so I’ve been around the block a lot. 
---
It’s a toss up between whether classic has more players or retail, I would guess retail still has more but classic did bring in a lot of people, 
---
The major challenge reason between leveling in retail an classic is that class design is insanely different, in Classic you have maybe 2 or 3 ways of dealing with a tough mob or set of mobs, and two of those required groups, in retail you have 2 methods of dealing with tough mobs, and neither involve group play. You won’t find outdoor zones in retail that only have elites in them, unlike Pyrewood Village as an example for classic.
---
Leveling between the two versions of the game is a tough topic, to discuss, as leveling as a gameplay factor has altered wildly.
---
Hunters can get more DPS if you have a weapon timer. Using abilities at the wrong time between auto attacks can delay your auto attacks which can cause a DPS drop. A weapon timer can also help with kiting so you know when to stop and shoot and how long you can run for.
---
Tremor totem is the backup plan, and Grounding Totem might even do the trick too.
---
Is it just me butndo I still get parried dodge and blocked from behind mobs I thought that could t happen if you where behind them
---
Yeah I have definitely decided on going as warlock. I was super keen on my undead but then I saw how heavily skewed the Horde:Alliance ratio is (60:40), which makes think I should roll as a human warlock just to help balance it out. I really wish I was a more decisive person.
---
Skeram PVP.

Maybe so, I’ll have to try just sending VW in manually then start DOTing

Best place is on the github issue tracker:
---
https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/issues
---
Actually, weird that you ask for that because I just recently changed the tooltip logic to show the tooltips on items to show still if you have the objective completed, makes sense to change the mob tooltips to do the same. As long as you still have the quest in your log
---
Usually not being able to pick up a quest is an issue of bad requirement data in the DB, we havent had to correct any minimum-level yet, just "you need to finish X" or "You finished X so you cant do Y" ends up being wrong sometimes. Once its reported its easy to sort out
---
It’s annoying when at level 55 you pick up a weapon of a type you’ve never used before. But it’s not like it takes ages, it’s just annoying.
---
Questie, bagnon and rephelper IMO
---
&lt;Pretty Boys of Lordaeron&gt; and is a Night Elf female... in other words, a trap?
---
There's a lot of people in this thread that don't understand this and are giving out bad advice. Everyone just read somewhere that people downranked in vanilla for mana efficiency, but they don't know why, so they just go around telling people to do that.
---
Uh, I play a prot warrior and I have no problems making money. Or fighting multiple same level mobs. People are just bad.
---
Spirit is really the primary stat for both shadow and holy priest, I do like to add lots of stam with my spirit in a shadow build tho
---
Overkill? Yes. I wholly agree. But the way I look at it. Maybe he will look back and realize his actions needlessly caused the chain of events and he won’t become a superhero or anything but maybe he will just keep his toxic comments to himself.
---
Ten storms?
---
I was thinking of doing a stance dance for overpower
---
Dammmm LmAo I’m jealous hah good luck tho
---
It's a very good way to ensure you're not invited back to dps.
---
Your mages are bad. They should only be using cone of cold and arcane explosion. No other class can compete with that.
---
What class/spec has a use for it?
---
I transferred to „dead“ realm Dragonfang and Booty Bay is already full of pages.
---
Someone gave me shit for looking for a goner group at 32. Some ppl are just assholes
---
Yep! Same here. They ruined my game and my female gnome faces. With Classic I have both back 😊😊
---
Or possibly a fugly goblin. Now you have something new to consider.
---
Also if you're a tank...wait for them to get mana...
---
Was healing a dungeon where I literally never got above 10% mana thanks to our tank constantly pulling despite everyone saying to wait a second. They then complained about the lack of healing...
---
Druids are great for versatility. Feral is very good for questing and later on with heart of the wild and omen of clarity you are a pretty decent dungeon healer if you throw on a few pieces of int gear. For raids you would likely be forced to spec resto but there is also the OT viability of you want to stay feral.
---
Eh, depends on what you consider "the best."
---
I love the hunter playstyle and class fantasy, myself. Plus it's easy to outshine the other hunters and get raid spots if you're half-decent and have a weapon timer.
---
I‘m at around 50g at lvl 35, think I‘ll make it? Skinner btw.
---
Fuck that mage. The end.
---
You've not been keeping your two-handed axes levelled? What are you, Alliance?
---
Agreed! I missed my old Dwarf! He's now back to his perfect form!
---
Can Orcs ride the former-horsies? Is there a list of this somewhere?
---
First 60 was 12 days played if I remember rightly.he hit it in the 3rd week of release. This was before a lot of quests existed and classes were much weaker.
---
I'm trying to level enchanting while leveling too. I generally disenchant armor pieces but vendor/AH weapons. Armor sells for less, though a 2-weapon can easily be ventured for 40s in level 25-30.
---
Classic is once again reaffirming my belief that DPS are inherently mentally disabled.
---
A story as old as time..
---
btw cant you jump on the back balcony on Zeppelins?
---
Shining silver breastplate is better (str primary instead of sta), but the next real chest upgrade is RFD (carapace of tutenkash)
---
Pretty cool overview!
---
Hillsbrad as Horde too
---
This is what I'm using
---
* ClassicCastBars - see what spells target is casting
---
* Vendor Price - always pick best quest reward to sell
---
* What's Training - always know what's coming up at a level up
---
* ccc - CC tracking of multiple mobs
---
* Questie - don't go crazy questing
---
* Spy Classic - keep track of who ganks you for later revenge
---
* Titan Panel Classic - just for xp/hour/session/level
---
* Auctioneer - know what things are worth on AH before you vendor them
---
* Details! Damage Meter
---
* Scrap - One click sell trash, and you can flag anything as trash as well
---
* CensusPlusClassic - run to see exact demographic of players on your faction
---
Cleave
---
Ninja, thats it.
---
I'm tired of all these Alliance assisting Horde, especially when they are on my server. Not on my server you traitors!
---
So you thought it was a face and now you think it’s a face?
---
Doesn't work all the time bit definitely has saved my life more than once so I'm happy to continue with it. Think it gets easier the bigger the slow too.
---
Yea, my point is that no one is going to question whether or not a peice of gear is specifically for shadow or holy.
---
But the healing shaman or druid rolling on agil gear always seems to draw attention.
---
It’s not a big deal since their next attack breaks the stun.
---
Take off your gear first
---
I went to the auction house and spent the 1g I had left on gear just to be able to kill mobs reliably 1v1 on my level 19 warr...
---
Agreed! This game is much more down to earth with an amazing and simple storyline that is enjoyable and easy to follow!
---
And the comradery and friends I make along the way is something that I just don't have with Retail anymore!
---
yea i love when that happens, and i love telling jokes on the tram to passengers
---
ogres aren't that bright (usually) and the harpies are probably blind with rage
---
que. didnt mind the language barrier. it made it interesting lol
---
Ha, take that alliance
---
The cost is directly related to the distance traveled from point A to B iirc.
---
Old but gold
---
An extra mage or rogue will bring more damage than the priest does+how much extra shadow damage the warlocks would do.
---
Druids make good off tanks. People forgot how each patch buffed them somehow. They were bad to start but by 1.12 made the ideal off tank.
---
I liked when both factions did questionable shit and we could argue for days over who were the good guys, now they are making horde kinda evil when it used to only be undead doing their own shit
---
I had this with the elite murloc in westfall. Several other people were standing around so I asked if they where here to kill him. No answer. After a while I asked again. No answer. Then he spawned and they tagged him, got the kill, and left. Took me forever to get him.

---
I wouldn’t mind one that helps with knowing what the true value of an item is
---
Wow, give your boyfriend a kiss for me.
---
They were digging in his ancestral land
---
Just don't heal the mage , when he dies and says wtf. Say heals are 10 silver a piece because you need to manage mana
---
Having a decent wand really help regardless of the spec you are running. I usually switch to it when the mod only has about 25-30% health left. You take a bit of damage, but it saves your mana and you will still recover from eating before drinking anyway.
---
*From,

I'll let that one slide lol

Yeah that first tick feels so slow.
---
NOP NOPE NOPE NOP NOPE
---
lol what? the better guilds are going to be where there is a higher population of progression raiders, thats literally always been the case.  Raiding is easy right now bc its only MC out, wait until AQ40 and Naxx.  Bigger servers will progress faster, guaranteed.

---
The difference comes in the wording. Normal spell dmg is written as “increases the damagre up to 20“ for example. Every spell has an internal spell damage multiplier. I think Frostbolt has something around 0.8, so from that it would get 16 more damage. If the item says “+20 Frost Damage“ it's always +20, no matter what frost spell you use.
---
I'll just fear then sacrifice my void walker and then run like crazy lol
---
This isn't true for most basilisks' stun. Not sure do disorient, but most lvs 30+ stun, which is not broken.
---
Druids are better MT then warriors pre raid due to armour conversion and health pool.
---
Well, the best kind.....
---
Cheers, I like the auctioneer one and vendor price!
---
Exactly.. this is what i miss.. they don't do it as well if at all anymore and have just been portraying the horde as bad
---
Quillboar Slayer.
---
The of 26% is divided among all the "ticks" of damage, so for rof its like 26/(5 or 6,cant remember how many ticks) and same for hellfire
---
How do I get one?
---
That’s what happens to your brain when you play 16 hours a day for 10 days straight
---
Except for troll priest racial.
---
Fuck off with your political bullshit, we're here to have fun, not discuss the nightmare that is politics.

It's like the Hunter who wouldn't party with me to do a kill quest. Well, sucks for you buddy because i somehow outtagged you even if i'm a rogue. He then procedes to bitch about me taking his mobs haha.
---
Easy 20 gold.
---
Sit and drink, if they pull and die oh well. Rez them when you're full.

Yep and then they try and drop mobs of aggro on you.   Had this happen to me today on a different mob

It wasn't me who started it.

Is there any aggro mobs or something? What character lvl do you need to farm these?

Then why does the Alliance have dwarves?

---
It's definitely a personal thing, but that said for me personally, if I invite people to a group for a mob tag I do feel a little obligated to keep them in and do it ad a group because I am the one that extended the invitation to go in this together. But I would never tell someone the group is full if that's not the case because I see no benefit for myself and a loss for someone else. I can definitely see why people feel differently when we are all out just questing trying to advance ourselves, but I do appreciate the community aspect and if I'm working together with people I want us all to succeed.

---

---
You're the one sending it to someone and you're the one posting it here.
---
imo (controversial opinion,) Vanilla's 2 biggest faults are racial balance and boss mechanics.
---
Racial balance isn't *horrible* for the most part... but then you see things like Human Warriors vs the rest, or Dwarf Priests ect. Busted compared to their counterparts.
---
Boss mechanics are one of the few things I like about retail. Boss fights are generally well designed and fun on live. In Classic, they are pretty plain mostly.
---
I don't know man, TBC was the clear standout when it came to awesome looking tier sets and it had the worst clown suits of all while leveling.
---
Fishing is harder than I remember. It took me from 150 to 225 about 2 hours of fishing. 3 fishes per skill point ans rising up to 6 per skill point with average 20 sec to get 1 g
---
Fish.
---
I'm level 20. Covered in greens. Whatever.
---
I like everything in classic more than retail.
---
As a mage, I cry when this happens. Conjured water never keeps up with my mana pool and after 2 pulls it takes me 45 second to get back to full mana. Then empty again after 2 pulls.
---
I don't think you know what optimized means lol. Unless you mean it's better optimized as a microtransaction slot machine dopamine dispenser.
---
I just right click ignore all these people. If they so childish they can't leave politics out of WoW I can't trust them to dismiss their pet or wait for three sunders.
---
That's totally what I would do. Hahaha
---
Side note: all my mages have been awesome. Most of them give me water, even if I don't ask for it. And several have even traded everyone food and water if they use mp
---
As a healer, I love you mages! Shout out to you awesome vending and dps machines &lt;3
---
Don't listen to the other posts, I can confirm that right after a wand you are able to melee and activate your wand again to shoot and repeat the cycle.
---
you obviously dont know how hard Magni hits.
---
Where are your boney parts?
---
Yeah, I bet he's one of the guys spamming all their stuff and pull aggro. Usually it's more Mana efficient to use Resurrection than actually healing them.
---
You play with 12 year olds or what?
---
Guerilla warfare
---
Most mages are like that. Hell, on my server one time, there was a mage out front of UC that literally gave a stack of food and water to everyone that entered. Guy was there for an hour doing this
---
Run like the wind, duh
---
Mages like that should get an award. I think the last group I ran with or the one before, the mage gave me also about 60 waters when we entered the dungeons. I don't know how to thank them enough!
---
what do u catch??
---
Agreed! Anyone who spends money on BFA will quickly realize that they wasted their money.
---
It's an alright game... but nothing compared to Classic!
---
Had a hunter do this to my group. It was in hillsbrad killing the miner. Miner was orange to us and everything else yellow. Took on 4 targets at once thinking little of it. Hunter dies releasing his 3-4 adds of orange and red on us. We almost beat them all but ultimately our 4 man group died. 
---
At the very least we killed our objective before wiping.
---
Indeed. Facts are the newer sets have higher granularity and resolution. Personally, I think Wows art direction kick ass but I don’t think the new sets look cool, simply because everything is so over the top badass looking.
---
Alot of those skills are absolutely crucial in modern versions but they also start the utility creepy. Cloak of shadows means rogues no longer have to fear dots, unstable affliction means warlocks no longer waste mana in an arms race against healers, but that removes that meta and soul link is by far the best pvp talent but you have to give up nuking ability. It's all a trade off that makes the classes more organic which i believe adds to the world. The class balance is undeniably crap but that's what makes the class.
---
Watch out for your keyboard my friend, cuz youll puke right over it
---
She did so much for civil rights, toss her a heal FFS, kids these days.
---
retail wow is coldly effieciant in its leveling process.  its guide the players by hand to each location they need to go and leaves very room for error.  yes it is a more "optimized" form of leveling. but it is also far less enjoyable.  you will die in vanilla a lot.  you will get lost and find yourself without quests to complete.  you will find moments where your only option is to grind mobs.  but, that doesnt make it bad. leveling in modern wow is a chore, in classic its a challenge.  while some may enjoy to burn through everything in front of them like a hot knife through butter, vanilla wow makes every level an accomplishment. it means getting to 60 actually means something in vanilla
---
Good move! WoW Classic is totally worth the sub!
---
Gotm
---
Just completely 100% untrue. Smite is always your best move to cast for about 2-4 levels after learning it every single time. Your "best" spell is generally the one you just upranked most recently, but not all the time. Holy Fire is only really your best spell when you learn it at rank 2, smite out performs it most other levels.
---
This is the most thoroughly well explained answer. 
---
Before reading it I firmly held the opposite view but this has completely changed my mind.
---
Always save your first Linen/Wool/Silk etc... to make bags. The bigger the bags, the more trash you can loot to sell.
---
There are always tailors in town looking to level up so you'd only have to pay for the threads most of the time.
---
Reckful
---
Ah, a fellow Warrior I see.
---
People who unironically debate politics in wow are worse than the people whom dwell in Moonguard’s goldshire
---
I think you can make it. 35-40 has some really grindy quests that will award a decent chunk of currency!
---
I misread PS1.1 as PlayStation 1 (PS1) lol, chill. I thought you were bringing it up.
---
Either way other than increasing polygon counts and tessellation. What sort of major changes have there been to textures? Because those aren't really revolutions as much as they are the same thing as before but just "more" now.
---
Meanwhile in Barrens chat, I just read someone hoping that everyone in the Barrens gets AIDS and dies. Or dies in a hole. Apparently both work.
---
Priest is really easy. Shield, mind blast, pain, wand. I can easily handle 2 mobs at once at lvl 25. 3 is a little more challenging but doable. You can also mind blast, pain, shield, wand but you want weakened soul gone asap after combat starts. Even better if you can time it so it wears off before the shield dies.
---
You never go oom. You never take any dmg. Stuff dies decently fast.
---
Nobody cares if you leave for that, they're inviting you for 1 less competition in tagging, and some free kills if you're near, and if you help with an enemy or two thats just gravy.
---
I love it when people give gear to the people its meant for.  I ran a sfk today and a hunter tried to take clothe caster shoulders from myself the priest and a mage. The mage won it thank god. If tge hunter would have gotten it i would have been  mad.
---
Same. As a paladin I try not to go anywhere alone.
---
Where did you hear this from? They might have very little downtime while leveling, due to wanding and spirit tap, but for everything else, they go oom too fast to do much. That's why people say they're incredible 1v1 duelers, but not as good outside of that.
---
I pondered this as well, maybe took vacation specifically for this.
---
And better yet! Classic is about a 50 times more enjoyable game. Haven’t had this much fun in a long time in WoW. And I’m only level 46 haha
---
Probably german.
---
Gotta go with an aesthetic you enjoy. I actually like the gnome look, a tiny female with a voidwalker is great. The human reputation bonus is very underrated though, and since rogues are a lock nemesis the detection is useful.
---
Just hard to compare against escape artist, arguably the best racial in the game.
---
Will be very interesting to see what happens during the weekend. I don't think people will want to queue all weekend.
---
I’d say come to Faerlina but I know it’d be 10x worse there
---
for any class the money doesnt start flowing in until 30+
---
World first Lava Core? Hmm... Maybe I'm missing something.
---
What's a good mid-level item to sell as a alchemist? I'm not looking for "get rich quick" stuff, but it really doesn't seem like there is anything that sells for less than the materials at around 170.
---
Today I did SM and got to the dungeon first, waited 30 minutes for the rest of the group to arrive, then one of them had to go and his friend left with. The group fell apart and I wasted about an hour of my day standing there doing nothing.
---
Didn't realise I missed having this much fun in classic, really was breathtaking standing at the instance portal for an hour.
---
Give it 2 months and this sub is going to be barren just like the servers.
---
It was already funny, but seeing “gorilla warfare” instead of guerrilla warfare cracks me tf up.
---
Ragnaros? I don't think so.
---
This was a great run! So much fun, thanks for joining!
---
Laughs at knowing how to use /unstuck when stuck and my hearth is down.
---
But you've only began playing today right? Level 6 takes about 1.5 hours.
---
&gt;Trying to kill stuff as melee? fuck you i'm gonna follow you and tag everything before you can even get in range (looking at you druids)  
---
I'll do that if you refuse my group invite for a "kill x" quest.  Its your own damn fault at that point.
---
Holy Fire for the most part is bad, but just so you know, it's your best spell from levels 24-30 to open with. Rank 1 never passes any other spells, rank 2 passes all spells until 30 when you uprank Smite. The guy you are responding to is dumb though.
---
I need to get some of those axes. I'm still swinging the crescent staff around.
---
A dungeon is a special part of the game. You have all kind of mobs to kill and there are bosses. Every player has to fulfill his role so you can kill the bosses. Also the loot is better in dungeons.
---
I’m still low level and in the barrens a lot. I’m a woman and feel like I don’t fit in at all 98% of the time.
---
In my last run, I had to ask the mage for water at least 5 times.  He kept giving me like 5 at a time.
---
To make matters worse, we had plenty of breaks (players going afk, etc) where he could have made all the water he wanted in the downtime.
---
Im out for th evening but message me. I have the perfect addon but I need to be at my pc to remember the name
---
Hey I transferred 1 of my characters too! Place is like a ghost town so far. What side are you on?
---
No dual spec sorry! Priest is still a great option. I just suggested druid as a new playstyle for you and because I enjoy being whatever I need to be in that moment. Classic in general is a much higher skill cap.
---
Their hots healing doesnt work well with multiple druids cuz it overwrites or something
---
For buffs u only need one
---
Anything more and its just for luxuries like combat rez and vate
---
Well, first there isn't a server closer to your location. DD is based in Chicago, where all of the other EST servers are located. Second, your ping shouldn't be that high! I'm farther from Chicago than you are, and my ping is only \~50 on DD. Have you tested your ping on other Classic servers to see if it's a problem with DD specifically?
---
Odd. Getting inv is the norm for me
---
Yeah I wouldn't recommend disc tbh
---
JUST BECAUSE I LIKE IT SO MUCH
---
Struggling to run a game from 2004?
---
Only did a bit of raiding at 6 with my hunter. I remember using a wind serpent I think??? Guild asked me to switch to a pet with a ranged attack. (Stay out of mob AOE spell range.)
---
Less experience gained, and also they'd kill stuff, I'd leech the experience and work they did, and also end up getting loot off of bodies they killed. That'd suck the big one, to group with someone and then you look over and they are standing in a bush and you solo kill something and then it's their loot.
---
I honestly thought about not killing him. But then I was like "But it gives Silver, Exp and Reputation"
---
In classic you actually feel like you accomplished something after doing almost anything. In BFA you grind a specific dungeon forever hoping for a titanforged piece of gear
---
I was bashing rats in deeprun and getting +1 mace literally every kill today, so might be bugged
---
I bet it will help at least a little bit.
---
More like 30-40  min, what the hell are you doing in the noobarea?
---
Warlocks EVERYWHERE
---
Human priests are the best race for priests assuming your raid already has 2 dwarf priests.
---
I actually want a alternate universe style progression. Give classic a whole new expansion, change stuff up and be creative, learn from past mistakes
---
You know there's a screenshot button on your keyboard right?
---
At what point does the game became of a whack-a-~~mole~~weakaura
---
Legit scarred for life after those on warlock. Blueberry can't taunt them either.
---
You should look up dungeons for sure, they’re a great alternative whenever questing gets too tedious that’s a majority of the foreign language in trade chat. They should just /just looking for group instead of looking in trade chat, but eh that’s a story for another time. I suggest looking into addons too. If you download the twitch desktop app you can get addons there through mods. Uh, there’s honestly so much to wow, but those are some of the things I would look into. YouTube is your best friend when it comes to wow information.
---
Unless you are a Paladin.. it will just take an hour to kill them
---
Everyone acts like raids need 8 fear wards. You need TWO to make sure your tank doesn't need to stance dance. Better off having more humans than dwarves.
---
Aoe fear and the multybox is ruined
---
Oh, that's news to me. Seems little counterintuitive. The whole point of silences is to be proactive and give a window of opportunity if you think you can finish them off whereas interrupts are reactive. It's also why they last such a short time compared to interrupts.
---
I liked that quest. The guy had it coming. 
---
What is especially funny though is, after you've completed the quest, you can buy the torturing item with 2 charges each and hit him up some more.
---
Oh man, only one specialization. That makes it a tough choice. I'd definitely go for a hybrid then like the Druid, Paladin, or Shaman. The cool thing was that you could try the heal/dps/tank leveling up during dungeons or quests and get a feel of a different spec for end game. But this means I'd have to learn it leveling up while staying at a relatively good place to solo, likely with a dps geared class before level cap.
---
Paladin was a lot of fun, but at the same time I think it may be fun to try something new and maybe roll main either Druid or Shaman for classic....
---
Just took me almost 7 hours to level from 49 to 50. I'm having weak legs then...
---
Number*
---
Önyxia?
---
You are correct in your assumption. Hold for mount, as long as you can continue skinning you’re fine. I take it like most of us you only took skinning to get mount anyways ?
---
"Here, I got these for you. Hey! Stand still. i'M hElPiNg YoU!"
---
I hear you. I feel bad for my tank buddy sometimes.
---
When does BWL even come out?
---
Not at all. I like them both for different reasons.
---
No ogre has ever felt the need to run. Other than dragons and us who else threatens an ogre right now? Thats why they all fat.
---
Why is Carson’s face so hilarious to me
---
Better just avoid the 50ish dungeons until 60 and respecced
---
what if i roll need on a BoE warrior epic and i win over the warrior tank and he calls me a ninja? What do?
---
That's what he did in original wow.
---
This guy is just wrong, ret is absolutely atrocious in PvP. It’s in the same tier as enhancement. Don’t ignore all the other information and only consider comments that agree with what you want. If you want to play a good PvP spec, play holy, which is one of the very best PvP specs in the game.
---
Ret pallies are the only reason BGs are balanced with all of horde’s enhancement shamans running around, feeding.
---
Those quests are absolutely understandable.  Grouping just neuters your xp and you have to share the drops.
---
I've managed to get a Mooncloth Bag recipe and I've only seen one Mooncloth Bag on the auction house before on my server. Wondering how much I should ask for the bag or for the crafting fee this early?
---
Either is good, just make sure to max one before the other.
---
It really depends if you get a wand early game or not.
---
Ahh that makes sense
---
It can be customized, I'm just too lazy
---
You should join a friendly guild and start chatting! In time you will learn the lingo and make some friends!
---
Cancer to gear them, aoe fears are your worst nightmares. Pvp is fun if you dont let anyoke near you . Once your toons get feared away by locks it becomes not so fun
---
Where do you think you are?
---
From levels 24-30 Holy Fire is your best spell opener, outside of that range Smite out performs it in every situation.
---
I wouldn't have expected anything this good for that price.
---
If you’re within 5 levels of me and are on Incendius, I will 1v1 you on my rogue and it won’t even be a challenge.
---
Hmm I should be trying BFA I guess. I know that in Cata both sides did some despicable stuff but the horde did worse stuff. And in MoP at least during the beginning, both factions were evil in the same way, I guess horde went worse with time seeing how you literally lay siege to OG.
---
Person: "Alright, I got all I need."
---
Me: "Sounds good. I need a few more but you're good to leave if you want."
---
Person: "Nah, I'll stay until you're done." or "Alright, thanks again for the help!"
---
Seems fine to me.
---
I’d say it’s your call in the end but 5g is not that much in terms of cost for the mount at 40 (100g before reputation discounts) and you’ll likely make it back by selling the leathers/gear you get from it by the time you reach 40 anyways
---
If it were me I’d get artisan skinning and walk an extra level if need be, you’ve already been walking it ‘til now anyways and should have a tonne of flight paths open when you ding 40, too
---
The totem quests are always exaggerated in tediousness. They're nice quests.
---
No way, that's a long way to walk. I'm staying in Tauren Bluff.
---
Play these new toons and you’ll eventually like one best.  Why are you rushing to choose something you’ll be looking at the south end of for numerous hours?  What’s wrong with test driving?
---
Can someone explain what happened here
---
Some macros I've had before
---
Poison weapons
---
    /use [mod:shift] Wound Poison; [mod:alt] Crippling Poison; [mod:ctrl] Deadly Poison; [nomod] Instant Poison;
---
    /use [button:1] 16; [button:2] 17   
---
Then pickpocket I use this in retail but I dont know if pickpocket is on the gcd in classic as I dont have a rogue in classic yet
---
    /cast [stealth] Pickpocket;
---
    /cast Cheap Shot;
---
Maybe next time😅
---
I could get behind this
---
Lol damn I was so lol with the comment I didn't even see the player name.😅
---
What a prick. Dude can cast evoc or just conjure more water lmao
---
Screenshot
---
Alot of guys dont want to talk in there as well you're not alone.
---
I'd just stick to chiming in on things you know/feel comfortable chatting about, I know when barrens gets into politics mode it gets bad since it just an insult fling.
---
This depends on pull size. Doing 14 pulls as W/S/L/M/P I am convinced that blizzard goes back to being best. For 6 or fewer it is as you say. But the control of Blizzard makes bigger pulls possible. But YMMV.
---
🤣😂🤣
---
It’s not a big it’s a feature.
---
The whole sausage.
---
My friends are lvl 40-50 and starting to pick up some cool loot. I feel like I’m missions out..
---
Leveling definitely, raids not so much. It's only in the second half of bwl they get anything vaguely resembling mechanics.
---
When I'm bored I go to Goldshire and buff (Fortitude) people. A mage usually will give me a stack of conjured water.
---
Literally just looks good because the colors match. My char in greens looks like a clown 24/7
---
lmao i think i see why your group fell apart
---
I only ran it once, corpsemaker dropped and no warriors in the group. Hunter ended up taking it.
---
swiss offshore bank alt*
---
I saw a shaman getting ganked by a paladin many levels higher than him, I step in as the helpful rogue I am and take on the higher level Ally to help my comrade. This dude runs away and leaves me to fend for myself. I would’ve killed the Paladin if he had stayed, guy healed himself last second and I couldn’t hold out. Stupid coward Shaman.
---
Giving it a crack now and see how I get on! cheers.
---
It was around 150 days actually.
---
It might be a little tough, but with some lucky BoE drops you can auction for a good price, doable!
---
225 skinning lets you skin mobs up to level 45. Beyond that you will need training to skin.
---
To be fair, the Goblins were used by the trolls as slaves and only because they had to mine all that stuff for them did they become intelligent. As this stuff has the effect on Goblins to make them super smart. And then they enslaved the trolls and had them mine it for them.
---
I got a rogue with skin and herb
---
I want alch on my priest but also ench ( unskilled just to disenchant dungeon duo farm loot). Good idea? I just dont wanna put much effort in his proffs.
---
For those wondering, the real reason is because Nesingwary is a game hunter, a sport frowned upon by factions who consider themselves proper. You, an opportunistic bastard, are always down to make a little cash at the cost of animal destruction though, aren't you?
---
tbh i find the reduced complexity to be very aesthetically satisfying. Too much in retail is overly shiny and detailed leading to the point that ironically the detail is lost and everyone is a basic color dump.
---
wish we had done that.. ufff
---
I helped a warrior get 30 hillsbrad human skulls by aoeing the farmers
---
Fadeleaf, wild steelbloom, liferoot, khadgars whisker, etc
---
The Barrens is the place with a rep for this sort of garbage but I'm sure other zones have it too.
---
Absolutely! In Classic, a single piece of gear is unique and gives you an amazing feeling of accomplishment!
---
And not everyone gets epic gear for free. You have to earn it! And we share and make sure our tanks are geared first.
---
he's a Horde sympathiser and if I see walking round in IF we're throwing hands
---
I'm level 13.
---
Levelling with alchemy means you always have potions in hand.  I've won 2 2v1s because of this.  The gold comes later.
---
For a portal at least 20s otherwise we're losing money. For food personally I'm fine with anything as it only takes a few seconds and costs me nothing, but a few silver would definitely be appreciated.
---
Nah u just gotta play it cool. B like 'hey my dudes i am single and rdy 2 mingle. You and ur lady know anyone else like that? Lookin 2 meet a buncha new people and see if there's ne sparks. If yes? Cool. If no then hey, a bunch of new friends so that is cool 2'.
---
Don't make it about wanting a gf. Don't make it about even wanting dates. Make it about meeting new people and seeing what happens. Desperation is about pressure and when you remove the pressure you seem like a dude who's networking intelligently instead of a desperate waifu hunter.
---
Source: in a relationship nearly 8 years and married for 6 years. Back when i was dating I let all my friends know i was on the prowl and because they were good friends they facilitated me meeting new people *and* supported me and my now-husband's early dating (e.g. setting up situations where we'd have time to hang out and bond once i mentioned i was into him and he seemed receptive to my attention). 
---
From the married side of the equation: when ur happily married u wanna see ur friends happily married too. We long term relationship are all gung ho to play matchmaker.
---
Not all that impressive when there are zero alliance Herod players.
---
To be fair, they also killed his entire tribe that inhabited said land.
---
This is why Belfs make me uncomfortable
---
Those monsters!
---
I'm thinking I may move tomorrow. Waiting to see if it fills up anymore over the weekend. Can't deal with the queue while working from 7-6.
---
And then that solo person can invite the next 4 people that show up, so there's a decent chance they will be the only group instead of having to compete for the tag again.
---
When a solo guy tags and kills multiple spawns in a row, that's what leads to 20 people waiting at the same spawn point.
---
Green wep upgrades excite me a lot
---
I played with weapons 10levels lowers until recently
---
&gt; Why are Undead trying to wipe out humans? 
---
the humans tried to wipe them out first tbf, at the beginning of WoW they are only loosely allied with the rest of the horde and the Scarlet Crusade is literally on the doorstep of their capital. They were torturing and murdering dozens, perhaps hundreds of Forsaken in Scarlet Monastery. Dalaran was expanding from the west. The syndicate was all over Alterac, Hillsbrad and Arathi. Its not until several years of uneasy coexistence that the Forsaken started attacking the alliance
---
&gt;What happened to the Lordaeronians that Sylvanas supposedly freed from Arthas' control.
---
the ones that immediately helped her betray and slaughter Garithos and his army, who were their former countrymen? its clear that the undead are pretty traumatized from their experience and are extremely aggressive and merciless, but you could argue that is because they were 'born' into a painful, hellish existence in a hostile world and for the 4 years since the end of wc3 they have faced constant hostility from humans, eventually joining with the orcs that I'm sure many Forsaken had fought while alive during 2nd war.
---
What happens if you try to transfer servers and someone there already has the name of your character?
---
You can do better and I can get some scales for my turtle scale armor.
---
Does the alliance have a Barrens chat?
---
Depends on level in my opinion. I’m only 20 and I have 1gold to my name so tipping a gold for a port would not be a good thing
---
I saw it.  Icons do that to me all the time.
---
From bread to bed.
---
No! Bigglesworth is my home.
---
Sorry poor wording — it was being called an Alliance raid, like a pvp hunting raid. I can see how it’s looks now after reading the way you read it first, my bad!
---
Depends how much trouble you are. If you bring a reagent, come to me and are polite, no charge.
---
Same thing with the Crescent Staff for Horde. Every warrior should get one of those staffs for their 20s.
---
Basically every hunter that uses multishot in a dungeon
---
Normally I don't mind this system, but the dynamic respawn system is making this one huge pain in the ass. I'll be in the middle of fighting one thing and something else pops up that I just killed and starts attacking me so I die  by the time I respawn, EVERYTHING has responded and there's no place for me to saftly revive.
---
Choo choo!!!
---
Yeah on average you'll get about 15 total while doing all the other quests
---
In the world sure charge if you like in a group setting nope share.
---
Working on my epic mount now :(
---
Only thunderfury is blocked by BWL release, not Sulfuron
---
Same
---
Retail made leveling trivial so the time spent seems like a chore. In classic it takes time and concentration and you feel a sense of accomplishment which for me is where the fun is. For my first character I was so sad when I lost my xp bar because it felt like the end. But it’s nice to be back in a game where leveling is a core part of the experience meant to be enjoyed and to require some effort. To each his own, but those are my opinions.
---
You haven't seen Teldrasil on an rp server.
---
I don't bandage that much, but I do eat a lot of fish.
---
Meh. I just join and let them know. It doesn't really harm them and whilst I'm there it helps plus they can leave and it helps me.
---
Ofc this doesn't work for dungeons but random quests it is fine.
---
Lok'tar ogar
---
Portals are 1g , food is generally free of you're not being a dick
---
Wait that's illegal
---
I tried just something like /cast pickpocket /start attack. It open loot table window but as soon as you hit him it dissapears. Cant click that fast to loot. Wondering if there is something for take everything, like shiftclick corpse.
---
Nice name and char man :D
---
I might actually run that, the 15 would go in both t1 1 in improved shield block and 4 in where last?
---
I pulled in around $280, $80 on a monk one hander weapon alone.
---
Old school RuneScape.
---
Says the man(or woman) who just off the mailbox.
---
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work.
---
My friend did almost this but ended up slightly under water and somehow didn’t notice his breath bar and drowned. Took him quite a while to realise how he came to his abrupt end.
---
Don’t forget demonslaying. Pure Pog.
---

---
Going out of town with chad.
---
Alright so toaster strudels are good... but! Have you ever had toaster scramblers!? Way better version with eggs and bacon.
---
Well I considered by going slow. Also when I leave the noob area I'm usually level 5. Then I take on all the quests. Then I go ahead and kill some mobs and reach level 6.
---
Ok, but like... I get the same shit, and I've never reacted. The most I'll do as a reaction is to ignore and move on. It's mostly just annoying, and makes you lose faith in the community when dudes do stuff like that. If you say you're a guy, nobody cares. If you say you're a girl, nobody should care either.
---
The addons you should use are the ones you find make your experience better or offer a solution to something you want improved.  There is literally no addon that is required.  There are just some that are huge quality of life additions should you want a specific aspect of the game inproved.
---
We were 3-man fighting the elite Alterac Ogres quests and we accidently pulled three in a pull, then a 4th patted us mid-fight. Through all that we killed two named ogres, a commander, and a caster, when a Druid ran right through us with three more Ogres. We killed two of those before we all finally bit the dust. I was pretty impressed we killed 6 elites in a single pull.
---
The Lore behind Zalazane is that he’s the big bad guy for the trolls, even Vol’jin couldn’t take him.... and then at level 10 you go n kill him
---
NEVER pay under 50s for portals.
---
You're fine.  The guy chose to compete for mobs, you beat him for the tag.  Players really shouldn't get into a tag competition with Shamans, Druids, or Mages since they have instants with 20+ yards range anyway.
---
Press twice is not a problem imo. I am used to have steath on 4 button unsteathed and cheap shot on 4 button stealthed. Press twice = cheap shot basically from non steath... unless u are in combat. Need to press it twice too but its nice.
---
chuckles in shaman
---
You can turn a lot of that of in Auctioneer
---
My buddy and I did Overthepants and Handy.
---
You do not. Stats are applied regardless of weapon skill.
---
Im at 33, til now I healed exclusively with Max Rank Renew + Max Rank Heal and had 0 problems.
---
Let tank drop a bit and Heal+Renew, wait 5 secs atleast for next heal and your good.
---
I refresh Renew together with a Heal when it times out.
---
Renew is especially good for fast pulls because the Renew will top the Tank even after youve done a group in my experience.
---
Op is a Tauren
---
current new rank at 2 per cast? Im charging.
---
Last rank at 20 a stack? eh
---
I need people like you in my life. I run into complete opposites of people.
---
I see a healer struggle with 3 mobs so I take aggro to help them. They just stand there and watch me die or heal themselves and pull more mobs. Don't even bother sending a heal my way. I usually wait until I'm down to around 20% health and feign death because fuck em.
---
On not a single character has my Hearthstone ever left the top left corner.
---
Name ”Yiffygal” checks out.
---
I heal instances as a Shaman, if someone tells me I can't roll on the DPS weapons or items they are gonna be disappointed or have to find a new healer. Nobody levels as resto.
---
Backwards but good meme
---
Honestly, not a fan. I’m extremely picky about my bacon and eggs
---
Privilege card? First of all, we don't want a privilege card. Second, how is assuming you suck at the game or that you want to be hit on a privilege?
---
you cant get blatant sarcasm when its fucking laid out in front of you... you are either autistic or dumb as fuck
---
hol up that weapon is nutty
---
You can use the lvl 1 frost bolt to slow their ass while using barely any mana and also faster cast speed.
---
Just a tip for yall.
---
Dominos for bars, WeakAuras for the cooldown reminders and a cast bar inevintorian for bags and auctioneer for the AH, along with some others
---
For under 60, cover the reagent cost. A few silver for food/water is good. 
---
For a level 60, tip a gold for either.
---
If I recall, disc/ holy specs were a thing for raid healing, for the spirit buff mostly. Not sure how viable that was though
---
Let me repeat that. Fuck you. I've played back in the day and never had an epic drop. Not expecting one this time around either. Lucky duck.
---
Yup. These people know nothing of trains. Oh the deaths I endured in Crushbone...
---
do you have an out of date error when loading Auctioneer? I have that as well and it never loads.
---
Haha your a retard makes sense
---
You are friend. Love, Orc
---
It's easier as a Hunter since you can just sic your pet on a -10 level mob and start auto-attacking.
---
You'd ask why I need to keep up my melee weapon skills if they're just stat-sticks. Sometimes you're in a tight space and can't avoid melee, but more importantly for Disengage and Wing Clip.
---
Seems likely
---
They have an option for character transfers now while sitting in que at least that’s a start In the right direction. Que this week have been light too on Fairbanks.
---
Of course... they get money lol.
---
And they were present in vanilla, so any time now.
---
15s means the mage is losing money. I agree with the 50s minimum posted below
---
Yup! My backpack is top left Hearthstone, followed by ammo/extra weapons, Keys, Food/Pots/Bandages, and then anything else.
---
Can also be 60 with those maxed.
---
I refuse to be an obnoxious grammar nazi, but it is crazy how many people on this sub don’t know how to use their, there, and they’re. Maybe there just really really young but I feel like most people had that drilled into they’re head by like third grade
---
They said they'll be looking at it but haven't 100% confirmed.
---
Yup. Was gunna comment this as well. They'll have more gear. So he better be making a list of people who out gear him and kill him at 60 too. Lul.
---
i don't get anything like that  but a couple of my friends can use some addons that i can't, namely bagnon so idk whats going on with them
---
Every death I do 10 pushups, 10 sit-ups, 10 squats. For flights I try to plank the whole time (and rarely succeed lol.) I stretch before dungeons.
---
no your just autistic.. but you have probably already been told that!
---
how is this working? can you explain it?
---
Hyuk. MuRdEr!
---
The problem is that people run dungeons to acquire a BoP item. They do not run a dungeon to farm that 0,003% drop rate item. Therefore they have not more of a right to get it than you.
---
damn.. I must have reinstalled it 10 times. I can't figure out what I'm missing.
---
I'd be ok if flying mounts would only bring you to specific locations. Like locations you've already discovered. They should be relatively scarce. This way there wouldn't even be a need for making it all that hard to obtain. You could name these locations, I dunno, Flight Points I guess.
---
Lmao this is gonna be me tonight. Im at a party with the wife i just wanna wow.
---
If you forget to dismiss your pet you can always tell it to stay and go passive and just let it die. You don't share aggro with your pet. Even if you see your pet running towards you with the horde in tow.
---
You just want 1bfor that max and honestly it's kind of a waste of a debuff slot to pump up warlocks, they're pretty threat capped anyway compared to mages and rogues and hunters.
---
Im almost level 30, all my talents are in shadow apart from 5 for the wand one in disc and I am having 0 problems healing
---
Druid tanks are criminally underrated and the idea that they're not viable seems more and more like a superstition every day. At worst they're slightly suboptimal.
---
I see the Yang campaign is going super niche with their ad strategy
---
1g
---
Right... but to say you're invading someone's privacy to know if you're added to their FL is quiiiiiiite the stretch imo. We're not asking to see their entire FL here, just if/when YOU'RE added to THEIRS.
---
How did you manage to find 40 hardcore people together to grind it out for 1-2 weeks straight like this. Where can I find hardcore gaming friends like this?
---
You don't buy it from him. When mind controlled, he just has an ability that teaches the target how to smelt elementium.
---
I put that at level 20, and the first portal you learn is lvl 40 - so I don't think losing money is a problem. Maybe at 20 if a warrior came to ask you for 2 stacks of food you have to make 2 at a time.
---
I would guess so. I'd go as far as to say they might add appearance change tokens as well, but stop short of race and faction changes. I wouldn't expect people to get super worked up about people changing their hair style or gender.
---
Races and factions kind of undermine the game, though, there would be tons of backlash.
---
Better than giving it to some lolret
---
You'll get a system generated temp name that you will be forced to change before you play that character.
---
At least cost of portal, and anything for water. It’s free to us, don’t make your dungeon healers tip for water thats ridiculous. Anyone in the world that asks for water that just depends do you have some or are you needing to make some for them? As a mage I honestly just let them tip whatever, but it varies greatly. Some tip 20s some tip 1g. Remember they get absolutely ripped if they try to buy water/food in the store, so help a homie out.
---
Can’t wait to get back there!
---
I thought the exact same thing.
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
Meaning its no longer a usable way of spawning quest mobs?
---
it's still the same amount of exp per unit of time. You don't actually have to grind for an hour to calculate exp/hr
---
It was full, the guy ditched his party.
---
Are you literally high.
---
Transmog makes getting gear after the crazy grind pointless.
---
Seeing people in Tier sets MEANS something in classic. The time and effort put in.
---
Class balance is what makes each class not feel unique and have an identity.
---
There is an LFG channel. Right click the chat tab and checkmark it.
---
Siiiick
---
It drops off all the whelps (Red, Crimson, and Flamesnort) except for the Lost Whelp. I just farmed for it the other day and it took 7 hours before it dropped off a flametongue whelp.
---
In vanilla they will. Even if it’s going back to its original place if you are in the way it will aggro.
---
Lmfao but it’s like 5 more steps than just snapping a pic and posting on the app. Why do you ACTUALLY care? Does it make you a cool internet guy to rip on people for incredibly stupid shit? You can read the quest text, right? Who hurt you?
---
Lol same happened to me. We got on the boat and they formed a circle around me. As soon as we started moving I was instantly feared and ganked. Stayed on boat and got res’d by the loading screen somehow and ran off lol
---
Warlock soulstone. Can only give one every 30 mins though.
---
Thank you. So. Much.
---
Harder than fighting Rag in greens? Game ez bruh
---
Quick question on the ww axe topic, since im also playing human i was thinking if maybe the sword/mace is better since we get 5 points in both? Can somebody enlighten me on the math?
---
Yeah it's a great choice but I can see why some people wouldn't want to completely change their only main over. But again if you are always waiting when you try to play then maybe it's best for you to actually be able to play :p.
---
Best of luck leveling friend.
---
I think this is a discussion if a loss in goods (smoking on health) is the same as loss in profits.
---
God damn the same 4 players in my guild asking for layer swaps every 5 minutes triggers me so hard.
---
Then when I called them out on it they got super butthurt. Why roll on a pvp server if your just going to be a care bear...
---
Op they all failed to say, but you dobt have enough bag space for that
---
so i can 1v2 but only every 5min :D
---
Perhaps but a GM will usually undo mail if you were the sender. More like they just waste everyones time lol.
---
In Vanilla I played Alliance so I only heard rumors about the mythical shaman tank. Been playing Horde for years now and so this is my first experience seeing Vanilla as Horde. I've had 3 Shaman tanks over the past 2 days. I admit I was skeptical both times at first, but in here to tell you that the Shaman tanks I've had were better than the warrior tanks I've had in classic so far. I'm no longer skeptical. You Shaman tanks are awesome!
---
Also doing this, but with alchemy. Any pots i don't use i give to Players who were nice or with whom i quested a bit.
---
You still have to get the gear in order to transmog. Seeing people in tier sets still means they put in the effort to have to get the tier sets. Sure, they could have farmed it after it wasn't current content, but that's not baked into transmog itself.
---
Plus, seeing a person in a tier set is cool. Seeing every person in a tier set gets old fast. Seeing everyone in mismatched BiS gear is really annoying.
---
Is it part of a rogue's identity to do the most damage? Is it part of a hunter's identity to be worse at damage than every other pure DPS class? Hell, I'd say that ret and protection being awful is actively counter to a paladin's class identity. Arthas wasn't exactly a holy pally, you know.
---
Another rational voice... I'm shocked. So many women fail to understand the harassment isnt because they are women, that just ends up the focal point because it is effective on most.
---
It will never change. Not because they hate women but because they hate people. Jackasses gunna jackass by any means necessary
---
“Objection!” “Sir you must review your evidence and your reasoning is flawed, ***I*** Love classic”

Sam’s choice brand burgers comes in packs of 2. They are actually fucking delicious. Very comparable to in n out once you add ketchup and pickles
---
"all the mechanics" topkek
---
Id pick whats cooler
---
I dont like how orcs look except for hunter and warrior cuz massive tier1 shoulders
---
for rogue it would be undead 100% for me
---
You won’t get any mob tags there though because that area is perma farmed
---
More class sets to obtain with interesting set bonuses that make less viable specs more viable.
---
Because people hate being generalized? Shocker
---
Maybe this is a whoosh moment for me, but you should have used "their" not they're, there.
---
Another way it works, and how they're also failing to execute, is by COD requesting the item, and then holding it for 30 days in their mailbox. Never CoD someone shit.
---
*Laughs in Frost Mage*
---
I normally die to 1 mob... I am a warrior
---
Oh, the more you know :) thanks mate
---
Be a feral Druid. 
---
Tank a group of mobs and do fine 
---
Initial pull agroes more than I had foreseen
---
It’s ok. Pop some cool downs and sit straight up mn my chair
---
Notice in corner of my eye that one low health runs away and pulls a few more in the distance 
---
“Well, guess I’ll just die then”
---
Wow, bind all spells on few keybinds, and go mobile. If u are too lazy to click your roleplay shadow mage skills, this game aint for you.
---
That kind of system incentives even more faction imbalance.
---
Fucking hate this shit. I always invite other people and were doing the same mobs, more than half reject. Like, what are you gaining here? Dont be such a vapid dolt, your pointless hubris leads to both our collective misfortune.
---
Maybe, but I'm constantly surprised by the beautifulness all the time just how it is.
---
Check other comments in the thread, I explained better there off the back of someone else's comment
---
Larger stable for hunters.
---
It's sad you're getting downvoted for not being a toxic gamer.
---
In all seriousness I must be a bad player. Voidwalker taunts, I dot.  Pull another mob and dot then fear but pulling another mob is a no go. I've died so many times as a lock
---
Was running in Stonetalon Peak after finishing The Den. It's a group quest but everyone had hearthed or had gone their own way. I didn't want to HS all the way to Freewind Post so I started the jog to Sunrock Retreat solo.
---
I came across several one-on-ones and, as I play a Hunter, I lack heals and buffs I throw a Serpent Sting (a poison dot) on the mob and carry on.
---
But then I saw this group of three fellow members of the Horde. And it seemed they had gotten surprised by the sneakyness of the slimes in that area AND the fact the keepers there had treant pets.
---
Now, in case you didn't know, The Den is not an easy quest. I had tried to duo it at L28 and had to abort halfway. This time however I had returned as a L33 powerhouse and had steamrolled it (with the help of 3 other players).
---
So, as I saw this struggling band of merry men (there may have been women, I didn't check nor did I ask), I jumped in and deftly dpsed the cretins down with a hail of arrows from my bow and lightning from my trusty Wind Serpent. 
---
/cheers were had by all and I carried on, content that I had yet again made the World (of Warcraft) a slightly better place.
---
enha with rockbiter can tank these

I remember doing  DMW with one but tbh he had lots of niche gear for this

I used to fish in undercity as alliance rogue, usually find someone already fishing and just pop out of stealth fishing next to them. One time I had almost 10 horde join in with me fishing.

Did anyone say...
---
Thanks man i will definently be trying this out!
---
We, The Horde, valiantly defended the Yeti Cave from Alliance presence.   
---
After this fight, we decided to take the fight to Lakeshire.  
---
One Alliance after another, we slaughtered.   
---
Hiding behind trees, rocks, and hills. We slaughtered.  
---
The Alliance defended their home town with immense bravery. You will be remembered.
---
Yeah I'm honestly just going to use my imp to 60 because the VW talents don't do shit and are completely wasted.
---
Most whiskers vendor for a ridiculous amount. They are usually white, like the gorillas from STV. But can also be grey, like cats in northern STV. They both vendor for 70s at 10 stacks with almost 100% drop rates. I made about 5 gold just from doing the quests and spent another 45 min grinding the gorillas for a bunch more. The gorillas in STV also dropped a +15 spirit 2 handed axe with a 3.0 attack speed, I sold it for 6g.

Ele champ here, focused casting would like a word with you

As a mage a three man pull is really just a 2 man pull cause polymorph
---
Hmm maybe for epics it's to keep supply down? So there's no competition for the one they have listed on AH.
---

---
The actual scam here is you cod to them, a little goes by, they cod an identical looking return mail back to you, you accept and accidentally buy said item from your own gold for that higher price, then they send back your original cod.
---
in the 20s u can do wetland welps or raptors
---
Can only hold items send by cod for 2 days, stop making things up.

Obviously the onslaught girdle on disenchanted, who wants that item amirite?

I agree that they don't, but having stuff like Human Warriors doing 10%~ish more DPS than any other Alliance race is kinda busted.

Dps down the one your pet is attacking. Switch pet to next mob. Dps that one. Let pet peel off the one you're tanking. Run to range. Now Mend Pet and maybe bandage yourself and dps the last one down.

Damn I got bone reavers edge in vanilla, no one else wanted it from what I remember.  I didn't raid that much either, I dunno if no one knew it was any good or what. Wonder if my old warrior still has it somewhere in the bank...

I got greens from quests that were easy and all i did as a sham was aa, flame totem and flameshock, this hard work is really killing me

Hold onto it till people have gold. It’s worth quite a lot.

Blade Flurry is also awesome
---
Yeah, speaking as a mage...
---
Party members who need food or drink get it. Other mages can take care of their own supplies, and I don't owe anything to people who I'm not grouping with (so if they beg I might charge, though I'm more likely to just ignore.)

Is it even possible to die in dungeons?

Love Seal of Justice for this reason.

You say oof, but your other options alliance are ret...and PvP weapon or not, it's DPS is better than most every other 2H currently in game.
---
mace is best on human unless you only care about yellow damage
---
Huge grats to whoever received it! On Incendius as well, so it'd be exciting if those were world first.
---
The booted guy doesn’t because now the 4 people who would’ve helped him will be gone. Plus it’s bold to assume they were actually full.

Just turn your back to them. You only get stunned if you're facing then when the cast ends

No flying mounts. Flying is the reason worl PvP isnt thing anymore. No one is running through zones.

I would like to see a steeper increase in overall power as you level, that being said, I love it the way it is.
---
Same feeling getting the lvl 30 mage wand
---
I forgot that First Aid was a secondary profession so I only took it at around lvl 20, sold all my Linen to vendors. Now at 25 thinking I should probably just buy linen off AH to get to 80, since mobs drop wool.

Bizzard reported ages ago that a significant number of people who made accounts since day one didn't get past the starting zone. With the cata revamp they made it much easier and added more guidance.

Is that healbot? It shows buffs? Does it also track renew, pw:s, heal prediction, and dispelables?

Lastly, can you toggle it to not use click features? I like to target first then use abilities, not mouse over insta casts.

I played Disc for most of Vanilla (30 points). Yes, you have less HPS and DPS but you have the largest mana pool. This is why I think it works well for PvE/PvP. I think it's a good all-round spec, and I hardly ever lost in duels, because of said mana pool.
---
You shouldn't care about swing timer. There are more important DPS factors that override the 5% chance for sword spec to reset your swing timer.
---
Oooooh yeah. Political mudslinging hour is the cue to leave general for awhile.
---
Hello all, thank you for reading this.
---
I want to play mage, the guides say to train in daggers and one-handed swords. Why? My staff does more dps the dagger.  
---
I have managed to get a mage to level 15 and I’ve not encountered a one-handed sword or dagger that can give me more dps than any staff I have picked up. 
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Maybe try and be a little choosier if you can. Theres a lot of spells you can likely do without. My rule of thumb is, if i dont use it on every pull, i can do without it for now. I would probably just advise farming basalisks for the grey drops. At least as a druid you have better move speed than most for a while. Its also worth bearing in mind, its not uncommon at all to not have your mount till 42-44. As long as you're enjoying the game your way right now. Plus investing into enchanting early isnt a bad thing at all!

Warlocks will often need to trash soul shards as part of the improved drain soul talent. Gives good Mana Regen but can create unwanted soul shards. Don't be afraid to ask for a healthstone because we'd much rather use it than trash it.

Good warlocks know when to life tap and have a self sustaining source to replenish health(food, life drain)
---
Topping us off is appreciated but not always necessary as we know healing priorities.
---
Don't get mad at us if you see us wanding a bunch in instances. The biggest leveling specs don't leave much for DPS rotations other than dot/wand. Shadowbolt is not Mana efficient in a leveling spec. So it's rarely prioritized in talents to be viable in rotation.

If you didn't spend any gold on the AH and vendored all the greens you DE'd you'd be over halfway to your mount and gold only ramps up the higher you get.

Prat for classic works
---
Weapon DPS is 100% irrelevant for mages, unless it's a wand. You should **never** be attacking in melee - weapons are only relevant for the other stat bonuses they offer.
---
That said, there's no particular benefit to swords or daggers either. Presumably the guide suggests that so you have more flexibility in what you can equip, in case you get something good that's a different weapon type.

Is there macros for stance dancing? Like for example 1. Switch to berserker stance/Use whirlwind Or 2. Switch to battle stance/use thunderclap? Or would this consitute botting (automating 2 actions with only 1 click) and therefore be bannable?
---
It's not always about DPS. It will later become about stats, and being able to equip a sword or dagger with good stats is better than straight DPS on a staff. Most of your damage should be spells and wands, not melee weapons.
---
A couple questions about paladins.

No, it's not on the other dps. If this is your first time doing BFD it's understandable to not know how much ammo you'll need, but I highly recommend upgrading your quiver (even if it's the one vendors sell) and carrying a few extra stacks in your bags to move to the quiver if necessary.
---
You are probably right.
---
Cuz I’m a mathematic genius
---
I might get downvoted to oblivion for this but one of my favourite things about Classic is not seeing any elfs running around when playing horde.
---
If the Earthmother wills it..
---
It's always the hunter's job to make sure they have enough arrows. Period. I always bring a few extra stacks and just move them over to my quiver as I drain it.
---
r/thathappened
---
/waved at a dwarf hunter a few levels lower than me in stonetalon a few days back, dude waves back and keeps questing. All of a sudden a druid a few levels higher than me ganks me. He joins in and /spits on me and camps my corpse with like 3 other allis i assume he called for. Felt so good when I managed to get a full group to fight back and was able to /spit him back after he spammed /no as we murdered him!
---
I would take Orgri too.
---
meh, depending depending on class it doesn't really matter
---
That’s so true lol
---
So as someone who never played Classic WoW (started in BC and raided only in WoTLK) I have a pretty steep learning curve right now. I rolled a warrior to tank with my friends. I only ever tanked in WoTLK as a druid. My main was a mage though so tanking is pretty new to me. Anyways, i’ve found threat generation to be seriously hard. I often find my self not able to hold a group of mobs with threat as dps will pull one of them. Is there some sort of optimal rotation to be generating threat and abilities i shouldn’t be using? I usually start with Bloodrage and then demoralizing shout and then focus on each individual mob tabbing and using sunder armor/revenge when able. I feel like i don’t generate enough rage which in turn means i’m not generating threat. I have like obviously shit gear, but i’ve invested a somewhat good amount into gear. I’m level 20 and just wanna know any basic tips or things to definitely do/not do. Thanks!
---
ahaha ok bud whats 3+4?
---
It might be better if you at least provide a video or gif or something.
---
So this guy dealt with corpse camping for an hour instead of rez sickness for ten minutes?
---
Meanwhile, on Bloodsail Buccaneers Horde side, everyone is chill.
---
Nothing.... if you're normal.
---
If they're gonna grind dungeons, they don't gotta worry about pvp
---
The economy is fucked right now. I managed to pick up a load of blackmouth oil for 2s each the other day. That’s going back on the AH in a month or two with a 2000% mark-up 😂
---
Shadowmeld does give a passive boost to stealth for rogues and cats.
---
Yeah, people always treat water totem like it’s total trash. It’s a slight bit tedious, but it’s no Test of Skulls.
---
You have to just find a good guild. I haven't ever had this issue with guild mates thankfully, but have had the problem with some creepers in a public vent when I ran Ashrans with Hydra. You just mute them and move on at that point tho.
---
That quest was neutral though.
---
Flying in the old world was the beginning of the end for the experience Classic has revived for so many of us. 
---
All I would want implemented from retail to classic is the new guild panels.  It doesn’t effect gameplay preserving the classic spirit, it just changes how you interact with guild chat and a few forms of guild management
---
I forgot how weirdly animated boobs were on Tauren. They kinda almost look like they're undulating. Weird stuff.
---
You do know fear ward and desperate prayer do matter very much throughout the game right ? 
---
Fear ward will make or break an encounter on many occasions
---
12 here 💁‍♂️
---
Ho-... How are they losing money? They can literally create water out of thin air..
---
Can we get a loot mega thread for these posts yet?
---
Warlock vs. Warrior is pretty lopsided at 60 at least. The pet keeps the warrior in combat so he can't charge and death coil negates the first intercept.
---
As a general rule of thumb warrior is never amazing in a 1v1 but the pet class matchups (and of course mage) are especially bad.
---
mostly tanks not understanding melee dps has to position behind the mob, so they dance around and force you to ass pull the next pack
---
Rogue + Priest duo good for leveling? PvP?
---
try tanking, you will never forgot lol
---
Maybe a detour to Ratchet, but those two are the real important ones.
---
Only works on alliance, fear ward OP
---
Haven't seen the advice here yet so I'll give it. There's rock elementals in Badlands at the southern point where the mountains come out next to each other. Agamands landing I think it's called. You can easily grind 7-10 gold there per hour and there's a vendor nearby. If you start at 38 you should have enough gold by 40
---
Ally. We are all pretty high  but have some support lower lvls. Happy to help with stuff like bags and little things here and there. Active peeps just a lot 25+, more 31+ and counting hopefully
---
Full macro support and missing commands such as: /focus. /focustarget. The focus frame obviously. [spec:1,2,3] macro support.
---
Dual spec 
---
TLC pass on tier sets to make more specs viable besides the current set bonuses that force you into 1 spec.
---
Guild banks
---
Jewelcrafting profession so we can make rings, amulets, trinkets etc (up to 300, current skill cap)
---
More profession bags, leather workers need recipe for a leatherworking bag comparable to the current profession bags with identical number of slots, same with mining bag.
---
Engineer toolbox
---
gnomish army knife that includes all profession tools [mining pick, skinning knife, blacksmith hammer, flint and tinder, engineering tools] (still need to carry wood separately for making campfires)
---
Multiple times when I'm questing with someone else I've had to type "RUN" in party chat, then hope my divine shield/blessing of protection can get us out of there. Also, target dummies are a godsend.
---
Then don't get a port.
---
Instead of making a game that more balanced and more people would enjoy, they should just keep making crappy xpacs, trying to revive a dying numbers system, and losing subs? I dont see how it would be a poor financial move for them
---
Never skip forearm day.
---

---
I'll be coming back after a week of vacation. 8 days no play. RIP me in STVietnam
---
you might like the style, and that's your subjective opinion. its just like how i love the look of old, hand drawn, animated movies.
---
from a technical standpoint though, the game is much, much, *much* less impressive than its main competitors. And thats not up for interpretation.
---
I'm a Tauren warrior, is my distant dream of a classic Sulfuras never gonna happen cause that wep doesn't go well with me? :c
---
Bit of Resident Evil 2 vibes with Mr. X :D
---
look at this fat cat over here with his copper to share
---
So with that pet you can take one less point and put it in something else can’t you?
---
What are you talking about? The Diablo franchise has always had the concept of tiered gear. No clue what a xharagtees is, but then I didn't play D3 much after the release because of how garbage it was.
---
As for the talent trees, those garbage things were in D3 FIRST. They were Ion's idea then and they got implemented in WoW when he became lead designer there. The old WoW trees before they were wrecked in Cata were reminiscent of D2 and D1.
---
If anything WoW has ALWAYS significantly mimicked aspects of the Diablo franchise. It was just unfortunate that they continued that trend with D3 given how awful a product it was.
---
They might as well grab the Ratchet fp too. It might extend the trip by 2 or 3 minutes at most.
---
"Forsaken are just misunderstood. They just want peace, but evil Alliance wont let them be"
---
Well you've got like 2 years to decide \^^

Hey All I currently have this macro I am using but I am trying to do a self cast with an alt modifier and then a mouseover macro for Power Word: Shield combined. I kept getting this redundant global cool down error any time I try to cast inner fire within the macro so I set it up like this:
---
Power Word: Shield and Inner Fire (self cast)  with \[mod:alt\]
---
/console Sound\_EnableSFX 0
---
/dismount
---
/cast \[mod:alt\] Inner Fire
---
/cast \[@mouseover,help,nodead\]\[help,nodead\]\[@player\] Power Word: Shield
---
/console Sound\_EnableSFX 1
---
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()
---
Is there anyway to make this macro work without the GCD errors so I can remove the sound and script disables?
---
Thanks
---
Holy shit this is hilarious
---
Anyone allied with the forsaken deserves death by execution. Death to the war chief! Race war now!
---
I was the main tank for my guild during MC! It was such an ego boost as a woman! My best friend who I met through WoW was a priest and one of my main heals.
---
We did a mixed guild ZG run once with another guild and they assumed he was a woman from his toon and name. They were on our vent and he didn't say much til he kept getting whomped on while MC'd. Suddenly this deep voice booms "stop f*&amp;#ing killing me when I'm mind controlled you idiots!" and scared the bejesus out of the other guild lol!
---
My hunter and warlock laugh at this notion while pulling 4-5 mobs at a time.  Or we can go pure .age aoe pull.
---
Basically this doesnt apply to ranged and spell casters after lvl20 imo.
---
Enchantment of course. Tailoring gives you materials to level up your enchantment.
---
The most important thing I've learned playing an alliance rogue is... "Gesh" means "help" in orcish.
---
Yeah i came back to retail and the armour looks atrocious. Like really? Is it really the best they can do? Am i missing something here?
---
Wait... You're telling me that you vendor something for 30s that you could be getting 40s for on the AH? Do you know for sure that it will sell on the AH? If so then STOP vending it and losing 10s a pop. Vendoring 4 heavy leather cause you to lose 10s. Do that 10 times and that's 1g...
---
If you're just trying to save up for your mount, then put that shit on the AH and sit on it until it sells. Can't hurt you that way as long as you don't sell it for under the vendor sell price. Also cover the AH cut btw. 
---
Just saying, penny pinching adds up man... Real "Goblins" take every copper into consideration. Go lurk the TSM discord in the Classic section. You can learn a lot in there.
---
so does that mean I can fire mage ragnaros?
---
BTW you can unbind this in the keybind options, in case you mispress it sometimes like I did..
---
I always just saw it as there were tons of prisoners there, heaps of em. Clear em out once but not all of them bothered to get up to go fight in a losing battle the first round, but did get up to scavenge the battlefield. They would've gotten away with it to if it weren't for those meddling wipers.
---
Its a pvp server tho
---
I believe
---
Sounds bad to me
---
Farm humanoids for coin cloth and drops.

---
And then the town guards clapped
---
Lfm rfk full on hunters and shamans
---
Because they are not the best and private server vanilla community is so twisted that if something isn't topping meters in one way or another it is literally not worth even thinking about.
---
This is the same crowd that on server after server insisted that Rag is so hard he can not be killed without 40 man BiS groups with 3 world buffs, because any other way it just wouldn't be optimal and thus not worth considering.
---
I'd use that to separate stacks of conjured food into mini stacks of five for everyone.
---
What’s the optimal class if not warrior?
---
This why Belfs ruined the Horde.
---
&gt; Do you know for sure that it will sell on the AH? If so then STOP vending it and losing 10s a pop
---
There's no way that shit sells, and if it fails one time, then you lose a huge deposit.
---
Honestly I feel like it just goes to show what a garbage designer the lead was on the Diablo 3 project at the time of development into release. Funny how that same designer became lead designer on WoW after... right in the middle of Cata. That's also when all the garbage Diablo 3 mechanics got implemented in WoW. That's also when the great subscription drop started... funny set of coincidences I suppose.
---
Abbreviations you might see are: 
---
LFG - Looking for group - People will use this in order to join a group that already exists for something. 
---
            Eg. 17 Druid tank LFG DM!
---
This means that a level 17 Druid is looking to join a Deadmines dungeon group 
---
LFM - Looking for more - A group is looking to recruit more party members.
---
            Eg. LF1M DM Need Healee
---
This means that a group needs one healer for their Deadmines group. 
---
It sounds like you’re playing the game properly friend. There’s a lot to learn, so don’t be angry at yourself if it takes a while to figure everything out. Level 9 is still a bit low to be thinking about dungeons, just keep questing and chill. Good luck!
---
I accidentally clicked on Gamon when I was like level 8, trying to buy food from the inn-keeper and he killed me haha
---
There's also a cooking trainer in the drag that sells meat.
---
No it’s more unga without the ‘is’.
---
I've never seen her. But I have seen Mankrik's Wife.
---
Go to SM library. The end boss drops a nice staff with a conical green gem embedded on top. You might have seen a lot of mobs wielding that.
---
thoughts and prayers
---
That "off" again throws me. Are you actually saying that Druids can not main take or are you again doing premature optimization because Warriors have Shield Wall thus they are the only option?
---

Not sure if Cool Hand Luke reference or not..
---
As a paladin, I can't relate.

were u upgrading many skills?
---
ProTip: If you have to hide your gameplay that much, you probably should look for a new life partner. Furthermore, if your partner makes you feel bad about your hobbies, you should also probably look for a new life partner. It's fine if you and your SO don't share all of your hobbies. It's not OK to make your spouse feel like they can't express those hobbies without ridicule or other punishment. Life is too short to have to feel shame about your passions!
---
As an additional pro-tip, if your partner has a hobby that you don't condone such as smoking, video games, or animals, you also should not be with that partner. No matter how much you hate the specific hobby, it's not worth it to try to change your SO to feel the same way. It will only lead to resentment and hurt feelings for both parties. It's much easier to find someone who doesn't have that hobby, anyway.
---
(Unless of course you're that kind of sick puppy that LIKES making fun of people for not being to your standard, in which case: fuck you!)

People say Arcane Shot is useless. Those people are slow.
---
Does anyone know what such orange glow on an item in my bag means? It only happens when I press Ctrl on my keyboard [https://imgur.com/a/0tGkjeV](https://imgur.com/a/0tGkjeV)
---
I mean the issue is really profit incentives. Vanilla created a massive playerbase, later expansions sought ways to expand and exploit it. I don't think classic will change that dynamic.
---
Do them when you complete the quest, not turn in.
---
Worgens in duskwood had mad respawn times when I leveled there. They drop cloth and you can skin them as well.
---
Ok well if your serious about trying to make gold then you should look into TSM.
---
It's an AH, crafting, mailing, disenchanting, etc add-on. It's available for use in Classic, but you'll have to manually scan the AH to obtain your pricing data because Blizzard hasn't released the API for Classic yet (if they ever will lol).
---
You could also try looking for work, in trade chat, with your professions.
---
Sounds familiar
---
There's one called "XtoLevel Classic" that hirumaredx recommended if you don't want the titan panel bar across the screen. 
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/xtolevel-classic
---
There were a ton of alliance players kill9ng waste wanderes in Tanaris as I was doing the chicken escort quest.  Well they over aggro'ed and I didn't want the fight to train into the escort so I started to help them fight the wanderers.
---
So they turned and instantly killed me for helping them.  
---
I hate alliance with a passion, they are all jerks.
---
That game legit tore the skin from the palm of my hand as a kid, jesus.
---
well if you are level 37 with about 50 hours played it seems you are rushing a lot.most people who aim to grab the mount by level 40 usually grind mobs for a few levels and go out of their way to make money with skining.if you farm beasts for 3-4 levels and vendor the mats you will have enough gold.if you are just rushing through quests to level up the of course it takes less time to level therefore less time to gather money before 40.plus 15 gold for ench is kind of insane for that level.i have skinning and mining until i hit 60
---
Yeah sure. I was more thinking about stuff like late naxx, as I was never there I did not want to make too broad statments. I mean rag just got downed by lowlvl loweq ppl. Why shoumd it not be doable with a feral?
---
That's what pisses me off these days, so many ppl following the newest trends, completely missing out of the individual part of such games. Lfg is full of spellcleave, meleecleave shit while I just want 5 ppl doing a dungeon not really caring about optimal comps. To my luck my guild just runs about whatever there is online so as long as i dont go public im fine.
---
How did they improve upon the boss mechanics?
---
Secure the Bag!
---
i am level 35 and found out about beast training...
---
Did you finally google it?
---
I've found that maxing out shatter and ice shards really helps. Usually get 2 huge crits per fight after a frost nova.
---
&gt;Just spam demoshout in aoe
---
Wait... does this actually hold much agro?
---
Yeah my best bud shares that opinion. BC was his favorite. Wrath was mine, but I also loved BC. Classic will always be special though.
---
Awesome, same server as me. Congrats all
---
My guild is just taking our time, it's great. Classic has so many ways to play though and that's great too. Feral can do everything including late naxx with tremor totem =)
---
That is fair, dwarves are the only cool alliance race.
---
It's funny that I've been playing PVP for a while  many years ago, and when the vanilla comes out, I still have the racing heart beat when I first see the Alliance...
---
2 minutes planking? Lol, good luck
---
Really? That went completely over my head. What changes were made?
---
In the meanwhile I'm getting 5+ kills in a pull as a lock 😏
---
I wouldn't say it's just as douchey. If I had to choose between my entire group getting nothing and me getting kicked so 4 of them get something, I'd choose that any day. Now there's 5 less people at spawn and the likely hood of there being 2 groups fighting for the tag the next time it comes is lower. 
---
If my group doesn't kick someone and we have to wait out the next spawn, there's going to be more people showing up to fight us again for the tag. If 4 of us get credit, I can just invite anyone who comes by and form a new group so no one has to fight for the next tag.
---
literally this. You could disable combat log entries for anything but other players and read the same thing yourself if you wanted to. The addon doesn't tell you any information until they use a class specific ability or you have visually seen them prior. It's an amazing addon for pvp and its a little cheesy but disabling Spy would disable a ton of other addons.
---
Thank you, that one worked!
---
It took me a good near 2 hours due to everyone there on launch day. But I ended up grinding my way out to the next zone, there weren't any people there and it was smooth sailing.
---
Stanley killed kittens for sport and had mange if it makes you feel any better
---
Lets say i didnt have a 1hander only a shield and
---
held aggro from 30 mobs with 4 mages using aoe, so yes.
---
We think its currently bugged.
---
Can you do a macro for weapon switches with rogues? Like stealth equips a dagger in MH and then sinister strike equips sword?
---
Lol were you playing with a hunter by the name of Agaden?
---
RUUUUUUUUUN
---
Have you ever played warlock
---
Sure I’m on the Aragul server. Think I have 12G I can give you.
---
Battle shout is more threat than Demo shout
---
Bro, classic is literally using legion weather
---
Yes, vanilla weather on max settings was pretty good looking but it’s different from weather we have in classic version
---
I was surprised at how much of the information was up to date still.
---
You can buy an Azure Silk set which will give a load of +frost damage bonus.  That might help.  Its easy to make with 140 tailoring
---
Your father was a raider for 1 night and he decursed over a thousand guildies. I dare you to do better. 
---
(I don’t know if anyone else will get this.)
---
Haha that's awesome
---
Nah.. down the line guilds end up with multiple of them
---
Misread that. Oh, there’s no excuse for running out on BFD whatsoever! ;-)
---
Normally not atm
---
Can’t believe I fell for it
---
Bagnon might do it but I also have some add-on as well that shows the price lol
---
Leatrix does this I believe
---
Leatrix Maps
---
Frost spells are somewhat more mana-conservative and also have a nasty built-in debuff, and you're paying for both of that with raw dps. That being said, I wouldn't call the difference "so much". That, I should note, is before talents: Ice Shards combined with crit chance increasing talents like Shatter and Winter's Chill let one bridge most if not all of that gap.
---
People used to write hilarious messages on the sign posts and stick them all over timeless isle.
---
I was walking with 2 alliance about 10 levels below me, paladin and rogue. After 10 seconds of being next to each other the paladin stunned me, so I murdered them both.
---
I just got killed by a lvl 18 mob at 15. Withstood 90% of my spells :D
---
Thank you I appreciate the detailed response! It's too bad there is no dual spec lol. My guild might have to deal with me being disc. Because ain't nobody have money to respec that much.
---
Thank you
---
It should be able to be done by all races
---
Well i mean there is no arena 2vs 2 in vanilla. In battlegrounds and worldpvp ypu will mostlikely be more or less people than your opposition.
---
So my tip is to pick classes you both enjoy
---
There are written guides for that, I wouldn't ruin purity of classic map. But that just me
---
Yeah, you wont find at that party with everyone circle jerking each other for something already done in 2004. You have fun though, if your big dk can fit through the door.
---
If you're raid healing, then use prayer of healing when everybody in your party takes a hit, renew on target who's not in danger, flash heal and/or PW:S on target who's in danger. Usually a paladin and a druid take care of the tank, while priests heal each party. It would be different for horde, though, since they have Shaman with chain healing.
---
r/nothingeverhappens
---
We need world first enhancement shaman hand of rag!
---
why wouldn't I have fun speed leveling? get out of here with your judgemental shit, maybe it's nostalgic to me to grind the absolute shit out of the game, because that's all it was ever about to me
---
An arrested development comment in wow classic :o awesome. Love that show
---
Wait I've found her and there was no plot twist? If you read the questtext it's pretty clear what happened
---
&gt;Lets say i didnt have a 1hander only a shield and held aggro from 30 mobs with 4 mages using aoe, so yes.
---
! Far out !
---
&gt;We think its currently bugged.
---
I don't understand the agro mechanics, but surely it shouldn't generate more rage than a mage's AOE... so yeah, bug? Maybe it just generates more agro than I'd appreciated though...
---
could you *provide* that source?
---
Fishing
---
Now I miss shadow word death in TBC ...
---
I have one more to return to caster form/dismount from any form so that if i press bear twice i don't accidentally swap out of it. 
---
But honestly there are so many useful macros for druid, its hard to not overdo it.
---
This made me smile:)
---
Always thought its a mountain
---
I will not break!
---
I was on whitemane when it was medium. and I'm staying.
---
I would agree about the racials. I play an Undead Loc because I love the character. The combination just so happens to have excellent synergy in PvP. However, I rolled a Shaman Troll as well. I'm happy with it, but I'm constantly reminded of what a better fit either Tauren or Orc would be for late game, and PvP. It isn't enough to shake my love of the character, but it does take from it.
---
It's an internet thing. When you're connected to people from all over the world in an unmoderated setting like that topics can sway towards anything
---
I'm biased though. I started playing during vanilla but not long before BC so I didn't start doing endgame stuff until the expansion
---
Isn't ctrl - click preview item?
---
So u can ire trying to preview an item you can't equip, the orange glow is probably just alerting you that you did something wrong
---
Yeah.. people are too concerned here with some misguided "honor". It's always better to have as many people get credit as possible for every spawn.
---
That's just wrong if there are enough spawn points for the quest mobs and they are fairly easy to kill.
---
Which action bar add on is that?
---
That would be nice. I want to collect them all
---
It's been years since I last saw the use of 'QQ'!
---
Imagine being that fkin boring and playing a human, a small human, a mini human or a purple human, yikes
---
For the Horde!
---
Just ghost him bro. Ignore and remove from discord. Byeeeee
---
I like that perspective.
---
Some, but we're not talking about the 0.001% drop, we're talking about the regular green boes that drop every instance
---
*CLONK*
---
Better itemization for hybrid classes.
---
It's weird that you know that
---
Damn good guild name.
---
For real. You only come across as "the needy guy" if well, thats how you come across.... A little bit of confidence in yourself can make a huge difference in peoples relationships, romantic or not.
---
It cant be bann able compared to what you have on live.
---
Ppl say it's not cheating but addons like this (cd tracking etc) gives huge advantage. They are sorta manditory and  i feel everything thats gives information etc, should be whats inside the base game... Not addons that some ppl have and others dont.
---
There is this bear with like 20min respawn. 2 are trying to kill it. I ask for invite. Nothing. 
---
They died. (And I could've healed them)
---
I solo'd it (I was a bit higher lvl) and then they spamed the invite button. 
---
Not today, guys. Happy 20min waiting.
---
Polyarmory.
---
Frost is more suited for CC. If you want DPS, go fire and/or arcane.
---
Well to be technical you could get one in your armpits. :p
---
This only makes sense when it’s a rare quest item drop. Troll stuff in mid STV good example.
---
Depends on your class and role. Ret pally go with axe 2. Arms warrior axe 1
---
Wouldn’t have it any other way.
---
Hope he's not vengeful and ruins your server rep.
---
If a BOE drops that i can equip and it's an upgrade i need it, simple as that.
---
Any epic i can't equip i greed.
---
You pull two, have the VW obtain aggro on both, light them up with dots and wand the one he's on down. You'll end up tanking it, switch him to the other mob, rinse and repeat. Warlock requires a lot of pet micromanagement.
---
I'm the master of hitting that spot. This was me like 50% of all boat rides.

These boat flexes keep getting better.

I'd gladly leave party and let them invite the new guy. That very likely means I won't have to compete with another group for the next spawn, I can just invite anyone who comes. Rather than us remaining a group of 5 competing with anyone who comes. 
---
It is extremely rare that no one comes by the next spawn, worst case scenario you have to wait 5 extra minutes for someone to come by and help you.

Ignore the downvotes, dude.  The people who don’t group for group quests are selfish or dumb - there literally is no in-between.  That’s how the game was designed.

another trash graph with wildly innaccurate level ranges across the board. Why even bother to redesign the other one if you weren't even going to put the effort of correcting even some of the most obvious things they got wrong?

Tanking can be difficult and people don't enjoy being blamed for everything that goes wrong which was common in the past. That being said, it's great you enjoy it and it's definitely for you. :)

I made about $425

Fuck this guy what an idiot.

I hear on the horde side that Hat guy is not very well liked

Wtf my guild spoke about this yesterday  for like an hour!
---
I used to die to the core hound because my pc was shit and I could never see his flame circle.  But for the most part they are easy fights.
---
I wouldn't trust these dungeon level recommendations. BFD in Ashenvale is insanely difficult at level 20, all bosses are red, especially the last one is really hard. I'd say don't go bfd before lvl 23, best would be 25.
---
How does that balance it out? All it takes is one faction being more powerful and receive buffs for being more powerful to create a popularity feedback loop.
---
It gets a bit easier around 25. Not much but a a bit.

JFC  It'd be one thing if the water had a cooldown, or required a reagent, or was permanent instead of disappearing 15 minutes after logout, then yeah I could see the mage charging money. But I could get water from a vendor at those rates. At least it'd still be there 15+ minutes after logout and sold to me by someone less rude.
---
I guess that mage really didn't want to be healed that badly, because I wouldn't heal him.
---
Drop quest sure, but talking about quests where you have to kill 20+ mobs.

Maybe they thought you would have learned after the first name change.

Wasn't just the name, guaranteed.
---
I was waiting around for a successful tag on the guy in the back of the cave in the orc/troll starting zone on launch day. I grouped up with some people nearby but we somehow missed the tag three times to other people coming and going.
---
A mage appears and rages, demanding an invite to the group. The group leader says that the group is full, and they suggest kicking me so there's room. The group leader does exactly that. Maybe they were friends, maybe they weren't.
---
I made a /target and attack macro and stood behind where the quest mob spawned.
---
Guess who got the tag first and left?
---
Scattered reports suggest I may or may not have /spat on the mage as I walked away, but I'll never confirm or deny such allegations.

It's really no diffrent from how so many of the convenience features that ruined the 'world' and 'community' aspects of WoW where asked for by the players first.

I remember people doing this on Isle of Quel'danas in BC. They would get on their largest mount and afk on an NPC. Players that did this were definitely temp banned for it.
---
Xharagtees was my phone auto correcting characters.
---
Diablo and diablo 2 gear system was not as shitty as wow. It wasn't all about getting set gear, you could easily get a rare with sick stats that was better than a lwgendary, which normally had drawbacks as well. 
---
Talent system in OG díablo was more meaningful every level, they just copied current wow trash system.
---
This macro was working well for me until I hit 20, now at 20 I took dual wield talent and for some reason the macro will not long equip the 1 hander.
---
I think maybe it, because the 1h could go in either hand it is confused now? 
---
I really dont know, I rewrote the macro to make sure I didnt have a mistake in there.
---
Any ideas?  
---
Thanks for sharing this, I was really enjoying it.
---
Try childeater
---
There is no point grouping up if the quest item the mob drops isn’t a shared item.
---
OMG bro, that sucks!!! Blizzard are basically nazi!!!! They need to stop now!
---
All heroics in Wrath had an epic on the end boss.

People were wearing T3 when they first cleared Karazhan.
---
Yeah, I've seen that. IDK what causes it!
---
I personally just don't bother to switch between the two most of the time.
---
Bet
---
Is there a version of this with 'recommended' level ranges for each zone? I made the mistake of going to 1k Needles right at 25 and got my cheeks clapped by water elementals, and there ain't no way anyones going to tanaris at 40.
---
but theres way better dick shaped rocks out there....
---
Nah no way, they said themselves that they'll cloesly observe progression of the playerbase, and release phases when needed.
---
Yeah ig
---
He is, because world/server firsts on world bosses from Vanilla was done more than 10 years ago.
---
Yo if you ain't gonna save me I'm gonna take you down with me
---
It's not just a graphical feature, it's a decision making feature and a balance feature.
---
Yeah prob
---
I feel like shit when I fail to save someone. Sometimes you just have to realize that dude is fucked and a ress is more worth than trying to salvage the situation.
---
Yeah, just make sure you don't always get the final blow so the Priest can Spirit Tap. That way, you don't have to stop for mana.
---
What else would it be?
---
I'm not 60 in classic yet. Are you some kind of slow? Rag wasn't killed for like 4 months after release in vanilla. People already know the fights so I expected him being down in 1 on classic. Not 6 days.
---
Lmao that’s my alt
---
Ikr
---
It causes a global cooldown when you stance dance. They used to have a wait macro command line to bypass global cooldown but they removed it a long time ago. If you were to bypass it now, it would probably not be allowed.
---
Wish I had that time! Sounds depressing but I'm jealous somehow.
---
For anyone that doesn't know, go into your interface options, and make sure you have "interact on left click" selected in order to avoid getting chonked by guards.
---
Hey you have to lack something being the most overpowered class in the game.
---
It balances as long as the overpopulated faction doesn’t have enough people to fight two separate battles on two fronts.
---
Many times through my journeys I think, I shoulda rolled a lock. And then I one shot windfury crit a mob and remember I am a god, a broke god mind you, but a god
---
Literally only one correct answer and that is axe 2
---
Insert Piper Peri meme here.
---
I decline invites for loot quests (except for named, obviously, since it drops for all). I'd rather fight for claims than fight rng if the loot drops on my turn.
---
Wouldnt axe 1 be better for warr? Has higher base dmg.
---
Toddlers in the horde, this wouldnt happen if u were alli
---
If everyone rolls need and someone really needs it, whoever won can just trade it to that person. The same thing happens as if they had rolled greed. Either way someone who acts malevolently is going to steal it if they want to by rolling need and not giving it to the person who needs it.
---
That being said, if you're pre-endgame the item is probably more useful being sold for gold, since it will end up being upgraded within a few levels anyways.
---
Must go faster.
---
I have died 5 times till level 22.
---
Can we get a warrior version?
---
Tremor Totems?
---
haha I did the same shit yesterday and I noticed as well the insane money it gave, but there is no fucking way im swimming around down there for a second longer. This quest was getting me triggered because every trap seemed to have a makrura.
---
This guy !’s
---
Yeah but unless you're min maxing your leveling speed, which you aren't, because people are already 60. You're barely losing exp/hr by just helping some 1/ 10 people grind it out after you finish your 8/10. 
---
Shit I usually feel like I see my bar go up more after 20 minutes of grinding some dumb tiger quest where 1 out of 20 tigers has teeth than I do knocking out quest turn ins.
---
wouldnt axe 2 be better for warr? higher base dmg.
---
Glad to see Hunters haven't changed in 15 years.
---
I really hope so
---
Good job. Especially being a paladin.
---
Now you just need a 15 pound mud snapper in the other hand!
---
If they're the frozen kind they're actually really good when grilled. You cook them from frozen and they taste great. You'd be surprised how many restaurants use frozen burgers.

I’m never toxic in chat but you might have a point with me arguing the name change
---
Spirit is great for warriors early. Axe 2
---
You can come from the south by going to Wetlands, north into Arathi Highlands, West into Hillsbrad / Silverpine, the north into Tirisfal.
---
Thanks but just to clarify, I don’t melee dps anything. I cast spells and if there still alive when in melee range i use my wand. So even if my staff is a higher level than my sword or dagger and it says it has more dps than a sword or dagger but for example i have no stamina/spirit/spellpower on my staff but my dagger have intelligence+stamina or something, i should equip the dagger?
---
He's a keeper!
---
Nice try, I could never
---
I think OP meant it looks like a dragon dildo, which it does.
---
I like to /s to myself when I know they can see the text box. It's like "who TF is he talking to?"
---
Then a warrior rolls up and does the same with Sword spec :D
---
5-15 is brutal. Then you can start getting dungeon weapons but unless you get consistent weapon upgrades, til 40 is gonna suck unless you can get the whirlwind weapon. After 40 is pretty smooth because of mortal strike. But you always have to be upgrading weapons or you are useless.
---
I used to send people giftwrapped bullets, always got a reaction out of them as well
---
whenever i get ganked by horde players and try to cc them i always get resisted why?
---
Snitches get stitches!
---
The game is going to slowly taper off over the next few weeks. It will also lose a lot of people at the 1 month mark where people do not renew their subscription. Keep that in mind. The big servers will be the ones that survive in the next few months. The smaller ones might.
---
&gt; I’ve tried everything to troubleshoot 
---
So you’ve rebooted, reloadui and reran the elvui installer while in the dungeon?
---
mate you've just been fucking keel-hauled
---
They just need a druid tank ;)
---
I think the implication is that he is not a wealthy man
---
Yup fuck those guys. I had someone not invite me and they got me to kill a boss to save their lives and i dint realize they tagged it just aggroed it and i solo killed it and they got the item i had to sit there by myself for 5 min for the respawn. Never again do i save someones life if they dont party me 
---
I keep hearing about how helpful ppl are but uts only when its convenient for them. Seems like the coutesies go down as rank goes up. I find myself in less grouos and dont get as many random buffs anymore than i did the first week. The toxicity is settling in
---
Also fuck the lvl 30 ally campers who camp lvl 20 horde quests
---
Close to the “let me in” meme.
---
I thought we were talking about portals
---
They should make its default color orange.
---
There is a Druid that main tanked all the way through Naxx with the exception of a few bosses. They're definitely viable in MC, but probably require more work to make it happen.
---
Feels fucking bad man
---
I play a warrior so nah I’m good.
---
If people are a higher level than you, resistance chance is really high. I'm sure you generally only get ganked by people higher level than you.
---
They remove fear after it has applied and only tick every few seconds, so that gives plenty of time for the tank to be feared and Onyxia to turn and fire breath the whole raid. Speaking from experience :p
---
That underwater rock formation resembles the shape of a penis
---
But you literally receive experience twice as fast, so the overall gain is the same, or even better
---
Yeah just dont give in to this bullshit, people need money yes but this is ridiculous.
---
Part of bringing a mage to a dungeon is that they provide food and water, same as that AI buff.
---
We're like rogues who wear cloth
---
Why the fuck would you use axe 1? The higher dps on axe 2 completely negates the str bonus from axe 1.
---
&gt; Even so, why can't I experience instanced content like raids, PVP and dungeons with my friends on other servers.  
---
Because a not so insignificant portion of the fanbase Classic is ostensibly trying to draw back into the fold feels that cross-realm grouping and similar mechanics completely undermines the idea of some sort of server community by allowing players to just freely disappear back into the woodwork after ninja looting, trolling, telling the tank to kill himself because of a mistake, etc.
---
The general rule of thumb with Classic is if you want to play with your friends you will have to play on the same server as them. The classic fanbase is not very warm to cross-realm content, we're pretty adamant that even vanilla-era cross-realm battlegrounds aren't added until absolutely necessary.
---
    Kve was
---
Yes. Your melee weapons as a caster are only stat sticks. DPS is irrelevant.
---
I vendor everything, i skin and vendor it. I got my mount. You can play the ah if you want and get you proff up. But i think if you want your mount vendor everything above 40s greens and get that G.
---
I dont know if ur leather sells, but its so easy to farm and  on my server they prices where like 10s more than vendor, if it sells. Then u have ah cut..
---
After 40 you will notice quests giving more cash and items sell for more.
---
I quested for 3 hours in badlands and made 20 g. Sold greens etc.
---
You will get it, dont even bother with epic intill u can get AV ram/wolf.
---
Bullet. Dodged.
---
I’ve been looking for an addon that tells me which common items are used for which professions, does All the things do that?
---
ah, now it makes sense.. yeah usually by like 7+ levels (40+) do i have to be same level as them for my spells to gurantee land?
---
Let me guess, you died
---
Omg that is amazing. If I know where I'd be hanging out as a 60 Alliance Rogue, The Great Lift.
---
I run into the Deeprun tram to kill rats until I get my skill up to acceptable levels. they spawn so fast that it is one of the easiest ways to do it. it's great for training unarmed, as well. 
---
I don't remember when exactly I did it, but I remember there being a quest item that was equipable, counted as unarmed, and did 0 damage, so you could run in there and just aggro a rat and wail on it until your unarmed maxed out.
---
What’s the addon that shows prices when you hover over items?
---
male night elf priests
---
Good thing we’re not playing Vanilla.
---
Not quite as rewarding as swooping in and saving a group of scrub allis from certain death...then nuking them :D
---
I think MC has been cleared only five times as of two days ago. Not much to go on but I'm gonna guess not many.
---
&gt; Oh, he came
---
People are being really nice. Even I’m being nice. Naturally I’m suspicious.
---
Do you think it's their fault for taking up so much or your time when you run out of food to feed your pet aswell? No, I'm pretty sure it's up to you to be able to do damage. Or maybe you should invest in a new bow with a slow attack speed.
---
I love how there is such an overlap in the OSRS community and wow classic community
---
It’s almost like your character literally has nothing to do with his.
---
why does grey look so beautiful here
---
can paladins and warlocks get their 100% mount in phase 1 or does dire maul need to be released first?
---
Look for the pandas and wipe them out before they can convince blizzard mists of pandaria is a good idea, you’ll alter the timeline and save us all!!!

being able to quest to max without needing to grind, or detour to other zones.
---
Class balance, or at least making it clear what classes can be hybrid. like maybe Druids depending on spec can be .5 healer, .5 dps, and it's still recommended to have around the correct number of healers and tanks in a dungeon.
---
that's about all I can think of. I don't really care much about the frantic gameplay of retail with all the buttons you need to press in rapid succession. I don't really mind the simple boss fights with minimal mechanics because it's an RPG. You should expect the challenge to be number and strategy based instead of reflex and skill based.

---
I feel like private servers made druid a much more acceptable tank actually. People like Skarm showing what they could do. Back in original vanilla, I feel there was much more of a stigma to tanking as druid
---
I had been grinding basilisks in thousand needles for a while (you know, the ones that stun or burn mana?) when a Mage came in and grouped 5 up in front of me and did the old frost nova / blizzard combo. I watched as they quickly burnt his mana and slowly killed him - god it was satisfying to watch him die. Almost as good as it was to watch how long it took to walk back to his corpse. I continued to grind them and he moved on to another spot. I could have healed him but the way he tagged the mobs from under my nose irked me a little.
---
I canunstealth by casting stealth again at least. So it works.
---
Everyone? Gotta be less than 1% of players rushing to 60 right now.
---
It’s not the quantity nor shape but what you have in front of you.
---
Uh, quit the moral play. If you want to pull that bs, then it is by far better to kick one person and invite someone else for the greater good of 5 people.
---
Never meant anything in the first place.
---
Yeah that’s why I said you could argue he isn’t a big bad, since Blizzard downplayed him in WoW so hard
---
no def tauren hill i was just there
---
The problem about polls is that many people don’t really look at the consequences of certain changes. For example: people loved th eintroduction of flying mounts, the dungeon finder tool, quest helping and other qol changes when they came out. So I wouldn’t trust the majority to vote for things that are actually “good” for the game.
---
World first, is it just me that this is getting so annoying lately? Not only in classic. I am happy for ppl who want to play the game the way they want and yeah, a lil brag here and there is ok too. But jesus, do we need a world first and a "realm first" for every server for anything now really?
---
Btw, i was probably world first vanilla having the Zulian Ceremonial Staff von Zulgurub if anybody cares.
---
Yes, but I want my slutmogs in an actually good game
---
I don't understand these reasons at all. I'm not saying this to argue, I genuinely don't get why grouping would be stressful. Someone invites you, you click accept and that's it, you continue playing like before. The only good reason would be #10, but we were only talking about kill quests in the first place. The rest are just retarded. No offense, but if even interacting with someone else is giving you anxiety, you have issues and WoW might not be the best game for you. Or in fact, it might be exactly what you need, because it forces you to play together with others and makes you realize that it's no big deal. Again, whether you're questing on your own, or with someone else, you experience the game exactly the same way, that's why it's stupid not to group up. Downvote me all you want, but sooner or later you'll have to interact with another human being in this world, might as well be in a video game.
---
Not true at all wtf are you smoking?
---
D3 failed because it was complete shit.
---
At this point barrens chat is just a self fulfilling prophesy
---
I have levelled a priest, put 5 points into wand in the disc tree (yes you will be wanding to kill mobs). Put everything in the shadow tree afterwards, starting with spirit tap. You can heel dungeons fine in shadow spec. 
---
At level 40, respect 100%  into shadow so you can grab Shadowform. That’s about it really
---
I had the worst time yesterday there... Was clearing the mobs with a rogue ( im a warlock ) and we did it slow and steady and halfway as we get to the cauldrons a 5 man party just comes outta nowhere and starts to ninja our cauldrons that we are clearly clering for! Legit told them to fuck off and get a pair of eyes and all i get is " well that wasnt very nice" 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
So instead of being a friendly clearing it turned into who gets the tags or ninja the cauldrons first 😂

Bet. deleting the comment bc it’s the best idea I’ve had since coming up with pisseater
---
It's simple logic really. Making fun of someone's spec does not equate to telling them how to play. I'm not sure where you got lost here.
---
Just continue as usual and buy it later :)
---
I've done that before. I posted 100 letters at 100g each and one of them had instructions on how to win 1000g and I advertised it all over.  
---
Btw this was back in vanilla, around 1.10 I think. That was quite some gold.  
---
It was just for fun, I've always been a good maker so I wasn't worried about the possibility of the worst case scenario where only one letter would be bought and that would be the winner.  
---
If I remember correctly I lost gold.
---
She is very clearly trying to become Lich King Jr later on when the Val'kyr show up.
---
Every now and then I smile and giggle randomly while playing.
---
If they are expected to use it to tank I. Said instance,  why wouldn't they? Also if it's the 1h I think it is, it combines with the other to make a 2h. And again,  why not.
---
I don't have one. BTW, I also tried to disable all add-ons and reload UI
---
Well, to be fair i thought legion and wod had really great models. Same with the heritage armour. 
---
Im just confused as to how simple and boring the Bfa stuff is. They have to know how uninteresting it looks.
---
Nope. Spec into defense and armor early on and make it your business to have decent gear for your lvl and you’ll be fine. Takes awhile to kill things and you’ll mostly be auto-attacking and using dmg mitigation abilities but you’ll be tanky as shit, especially if you have a decent enough 1her to use a shield.
---
I've DE'd just about every green I've come across. now I'm 150 Enchanting, and still only have 10 gold to my name at level 30. (I'm a mage, I love using spells, and I tend to poorly plan out adventures which leads to more flight/tp fees)
---
Now I'm just going to shelve Enchanting until I can get my mount. so that means checking the AH on every Greed roll won, and every mob drop. I'll also be trying to sell my Tailoring services in Org. because I know that tips are everything.
---
I'd like one which doesn't reveal the map itself :/
---
Indeed :D one of us one of us.
---
Not really. What makes Barrens so batshit insane is the size and massive level range. Alliance has nothing like that.
---
I’m from sweden, we dont talk with strangers on public transport.
---
Thought this was on my r/gaymers feed. Not grindr I guess
---
I think it will offset it somewhat , not completely but at least it couls start bringing this genre to its former glory.
---
Questing is atrocious on retail.  Pick up 10 quests from small hub, complete all within 500yd from hub, go back and turn in quests at hub, move on to the next hub and do the same exact shit.
---
Usually I ignore retail posts... but damned be me! Screw these murlocs!
---
Private servers differ in a few ways from classic or retail.  We knew this would be the case pre launch.  Classic, like vanilla is not balanced, we knew this pre launch.  
---
You think mages can't be beat then roll one up... What's your issue here?
---
Is this zandalar tribe?
---
Don’t use every ability on cooldown if you’re running out. Stick to auto-shot and the odd multi/arcane shot. Don’t spam abilities. You won’t top DPS meters as a result, but you’ll do more damage (and be more useful) than if you just meleed.
---
Or fill your quiver and carry spare in your bags.
---
But leveling feral while keeping an int/spirit set in your bags is even better. You get the solo speed of feral and the ability to tank or heal dungeons.
---
If you are a mage you can always easy aoe farm
---
Ew
---
Elvui works well, otherwise just use raid profile frames as part frames.
---
It’s a goblin ‘submarine’ from WarCraft II.
---
Leatrix Maps, shows zone level ranges exactly like retail, dungeon icons, dungeon level ranges and flight points.
---
Also reveals the map, lets you move and rescale the map and has a super sexy borderless map mode.
---

---
That has to do with technical capability and scalability: one, the game is built on a 15+-year-old engine, so I imagine graphical upgrades of that scale would be very difficult to achieve; and two, simulating that sort of clothing physics is undoubtedly very resource intensive, and WoW has always had relatively low requirements to run. 
---
Could you point me to some examples of games that do these things well enough to impress you? MMOs in particular. I'm not being snide here, I'm genuinely curious. 
---
In any case, if that's the standard by which we're judging WoW, releasing Classic without at least bringing it on par with modern WoW's textures and models should be considered a massive travesty.
---
If it was about economics, you would understand you roll greed if you're going to sell. Thus, it's not about economics, it really is about greed rolling as need. you choice bro.

the ziggler went down to 3 gold, should i replace my secondary(1,30 speed) with it, even though it is slower?
---
XD
---
In the wowhead wiki you linked, they say it's going for around 75-90g and some people want to buy it at 45g.
---
He's probably a warrior
---
Gold comes in very quickly at 40+ you’ll have your mount soon :D  
---
That said, if you don’t need certain items like cloth, upsell then on the AH. High demand items will still sell, don’t undercut.
---
OP already has a mount tho :P
---
IIRC it was a shaman, right?
---
you probably wont replace it until ravager
---
You sure? Can almost guarantee you it was the name. It usually goes: force name change --&gt; temporary ban.
---
Congratulations on this milestone, upwards an onwards to 60!
---
Ahh, shield wall. The "use 2 or 3 times per raid" ability.
---
This is the real comment here. Fuck runecrafting.
---
The issue is just people who havnt played vanilla much or at all may not know how op they are. Those people should know what the best class is without all the nonsense of people trying to rationalize the extreme downsides of the other classes.
---
?? Go from Ashenvale to stonetalon.
---
yeah but they all suck aside from enh
---
Haven't experienced this yet. That's sad :/ Even if I am playing with my friends we usually have room. Usually we kick one of us who is not there if we don't have room tbh xD We just wanna help and get help

When windfury procs, it gives you 315 AP for 1 second. I think that rather than micromanaging swing timers, you should take advantage of this window by only using sinister strike when you get a windfury proc or if you are about to overcap. By doing this, you passively only sinister strike after a swing anyways, because only swings will proc windfury, and you get a much more powerful sinister strike (and resulting sword procs).
---
I don't disagree with you on the gear. But vanilla and classic are still far better about that than retail, if anything retail has expounded on the gear set as being king.
---
As for the talents, I still don't understand what you are trying to say here. If you are saying that the Diablo 2 talent trees were better than the vanilla and thus classic talent trees, okay I can see an argument for that. If you are saying Diablo 3 copied it's release version of it's talent trees from WoW, that is provably false. The Mickey Mouse sheet "no wrong answers" talent trees existed in Diablo 3 first and then were implemented shortly after into WoW during Cataclysm.
---
To preface this: I stsrted playing in WotLK where PW:S was king due to mana management. 
---
TLDR: PW:S is a waste of mana unless you need an emergency window to cast Flash Heal into Heal (Rank *) or Lesser Heal (Rank *).
---
I main a priest right now and have found that PW:S is a waste of mana that could be better spent healing or, for slow damage mobs, tossing on a renew and letting my MP5 take over. The only time I will use PW:S is when the tank is taking burst damage and I need time to cast Flash Heal and then a Heal at my highest rank or resume with Lesser Heal for mana conversation if possible.
---
Ima be honest, while I’m enjoying classic a lot there’s a lot about retail I miss having come back to wow after a three year break. 
---
Mainly the transmog and races. Unpopular opinion I guess, but I think classic in functionality but with all the races and classes would have been sick if manageable

If I'm in front I always do fart emotes in that situation.
---
You typically don't want to use it on tanks because it stunts their rage generation, with the exception of it saving them from a death. I use it as an 'Oh shit' mostly
---
I mean, this guy deliberately refuses to group with mages because he's salty toward them... sounds like "toxicity" in response to "toxicity" if you ask me. He's as much a part of his server's problem as anyone else.
---
Shit gets weird in the barrens.
---
SEX IS A TEXAS DROUGHT
---
My friends got so mad at me the other day when I didn't heal them as they tried to team up against a higher level night elf druid.  I just watched them die and then me and the other druid nodded at each other and he took off. I'm like "Sorry guys. It's the druid code."
---
There's art, and there's A R T.
---
This is the latter.
---
Not for leveling speed, but to save money, sure.
---
The minimum level that you have for these is too low imo. Add 2 levels to everything after the level 30ish zones, otherwise you'll only be able to pick up a couple quests, and most mobs will be orange/red.
---
Good luck going to Burning Steppes 50, or ungoro at 48!
---
I submitted a ticked under suggestions to make channel invites right clickable for reporting. Even if you block the invites, you still get a notification that they happened.
---
Get this garbage BFA off the classic forum.
---
The only thing they can't tank is nefarion (at least in the first two raids)
---
Isn't healbot just mouseovers macros made easier?
---
can't wait till i get windfury just for these moments
---
People were discussing whether or not jesus would eat ass today. I couldn't find better entertainment if I tried.
---
You only need to download Classic. Change to that option in the drop down menu.
---
Look at that sexy BiS belt tho...
---
Yep, res sickness. This video is totally unimpressive. Would have been an honorless kill anyways.
---
Since nobody said it and I do this sometimes, they might have just punched in numbers without checking which field they were entering into. The 80g reflects a failed attempt at posting an 80s undercut
---
*This is democracy, manifest.*
---
I feel like it actually handles the "80%" a lot better than other modern raid-focused MMOs with Normal mode.
---
Wetlands is reserved for discussing the morality of ganking low levels, because that's all I ever see there
---
All you need to download and play classic is game time. You do not have to download retail. As soon as you have purchased game time you will have the option (just above the download button) to switch to classic.
---
Depends on your lvl :)
---
They can main tank, they are just better (raid-wise) as of tanks, because a non tanking feral druid dps is still some dps while a non tanking prot warrior is useless
---
Dont Think you need to have retail installed only bnet! Theres a seperate option for classic when installing on bnet
---
It's amazing how fast this sub and the forums went from showing off queues for quest mobs/items to praising people ninjaing spawns. 
---
He probably kicked someone from his group that had been waiting for longer than you, why would he not invite you to a quest to just kill one mob?

I like big buttons and I cannot lie.

No, that's a voidwalker.

It's "feral"

I am in this video! As an alliance member standing in the throne room. My name is "Siegward". :o

My mate said "karma" as we were leaving and they lost it

WTB The Sword of a Thousand Truths

We were the first guild on our server, we set it up after about 20 minutes from launch
---
“When coming via barrens”
---
Druids are literally the least desirable class in the game, ideally you'd only want one or two in your roster of 40 and both of them resto.
---
Gz thats a hefty amount of gold, will be worth a lot later
---
Just move on then. World firsts die off in time. Go be grumpy in some other post.
---
 It’s been out for less than 2 weeks. Really not long enough to bitch about people’s crazy lucky world firsts. Out of any gear drop posts, legendary progress are the ones worthy of news.
---
I feared an afk dwarf into Orgres aswell

Light leather is on the ah for just above vendor price, and there is more supply than demand. If you take skinning to make money on a fresh server, you vendor the leather
---
50g it is then!
---
Its double digits now i think. Like 10 or 13
---
Now they have a cert error. :/
---
&gt; Because they are not the best and private server vanilla community is so twisted that if something isn't topping meters in one way or another it is literally not worth even thinking about.
---
&gt; This is the same crowd that on server after server insisted that Rag is so hard he can not be killed without 40 man BiS groups with 3 world buffs, because any other way it just wouldn't be optimal and thus not worth considering.
---
amen brother, Im a shaman tank and I find myself a tad lower in threat than druids and everyone screams because its not topping meters.
---
This pretty much sums up barrens chat on my server perfectly
---
No pots aren't dispellable. Try and outrage his wand and interrupt his mind blast / mind flay as much as possible
---
Real life elitism. Strange thing to witness.
---
Druid tanks are absolutely not a meme spec they're damn near optimal.
---
That's too much effort for me. I prefer "/tar npc_name"
---
No, but trying to level it early is. Much easier to accumulate disenchantable items later on.
---
Imagine not having aquatic form
---
this post brought to you by the druid gang
---
Lol not everyone played on pservers or obsessively researched before getting into classic. 
---
Believe it or not a significant portion of the population is relatively new to the game.
---
Disproportionally large weapons look disproportionally large on some characters, which is reasonable? At the same time, you can compare normal size low level weapons in hands of a tauren.
---
Neither of those classes have what you want. No one wants a ret paladin in a raid, hunters could find a spot, but they're the weakest dps class excepting healers and priests are a pain to level. I'd look into mage or warlock as the levelling ability is excellent and they're desirable in raids.
---
So without Game Time added, you can't download Classic right?
---
I can take it, sell it, and buy something equally valuable to my character.  That's need.
---
I would've just said "full" after the decline
---
You can take the talon deep mountain path from ashenvale as well and run through stonetalon without venturing into the barrens.
---
Shellfish In Desolace works nicely
---
Ok. The dark triad personality traits(narcissism, machiavellianism, psychopathy) is still linked to trolling.
---
oh no a fair fight! run!
---
Tried both. Both got erased multiple times.
---
I’ll probably end up doing just that.
---
&gt; There is a Druid that main tanked all the way through Naxx with the exception of a few bosses. They're definitely viable in MC, but probably require more work to make it happen.
---
There was a rogue, warlock, shaman, hunter, priest who main tanked up t'ill AQ, so nothing surprising.
---
P.S. It was me :)
---
Heh, same. Except I'm still stuck at Heavy Wool bandages :(
---
He should have said “Maybe THEY’RE just young..”
---
You forgot the hunnie mustie and dewie, you amateur.
---
Even though you’re resto, cat form is still your best friend for leveling once you get it
---
Got this one too. Funny sh\*t, but it's definitely a bug, so yes, should be reported
---
Because it looks like fucking shit. Stop being lazy with your posts. It’s pixelated and distorted

Holy fuck yall are so negative. Let the mans and the people have some fun. It's fun to see people get hype about things when the game was actually good. Take your toxicity back to BFA
---
That's a behemoth right, I tried it shortly didn't seem to get it to work, thx
---
Quite a few times i’ve invited fuckers just for their own benefit. Already knowing damn well my auto target and macro will win regardless (unless they have the same thing). Don’t be afraid to come out of ur shell peeps.
---
Could potentially this. First time I saved one my battery died. Second time I got DC’d and last night when I pressed escape and close game and log out. Neither would work. So I had to go to my desktop and close it from there.
---
I’ll make one again. Log out normally then see if it saves. I assume I only need to do this the first time? Once it’s saved it won’t matter if I get DC’d or not?
---
Don't stress it too much, try out as many classes as you want. Eventually you'll find one you really like or you'll get so sick of the starting zones youll be forced to stick with one of your established toons. If you really want to commit though, maybe watch some class overview videos, check out the talent trees, builds, leveling guides, utilities, etc of different classes at 60. Then you'll know what you get and when and what to look forward to, although be warned, some might say that sort of spoils some aspects of the game.
---
&gt; Maybe the answer is in the bonus spellpower applies to SoR as opposed to an extra swing every 2 minutes but JoR should push things in favor of extra spellpower, no?
---
I warn you theorcyrafting spelladin can be quite the challenge and cause headaches along the way. Definitely the hardest notion to theorycraft.
---
This kinda make sense, but it's 3 faction so the two less more powerful are still fighting each other too, if you ignore that it may as well only be 2 sides...
---
I'm a mage bitch I don't need you all I need is blizzard
---
That’s what I’ve read to use that as the main way to level. Im using a lvling talent tree til 30 or 60 then start going into resto build so I know cat form will be my best friend especially since I just hit lvl 20 tonight
---
Guy does not get the diff between vanilla and classic lul
---
 That's a shame really, kinda takes away from the games community, imagine those 35 slots being open for regular players on a full server :/
---
Does it really matter which way they're coming though? Horde will still be there in stonetalon.
---
Thanks, there’s so much I’ve forgotten about this game. What ten years will do....
---
Here i am lvl 23..
---
I am aware, but to me Shaman tank are much like Warlock tanks in MoP. There is few scenarios where with effort they can be used, but if you try to use them for normal content they are borderline impossible to use. 
---
Sure there are bosses where Shamans can tank, but would you ever bring a Shaman tank to any 5 man instance? Lack of taunt and general AoE threat becomes a huge issue.
---
Something like this
---
    #showtooltip Stealth
---
    /cast !Stealth
---
    /equipslot [stealth,noequipped:Daggers] 16 DaggerName
---
And for SS
---
    #showtooltip Sinister Strike
---
    /equipslot [noequipped:One-Handed Swords] 16 SwordName
---
    /cast Sinister Strike
---
Skeram was literally a server people migrated off 4head
---
You could try the addin called “xptolevel” I’m not sure if it does the quest panexpbyt it will tell you how many mobs tonext level
---
Hi there. I am torn between two classes at the moment..rogue and mage. Im not sure which one to pick. 
---
I dont plan on playing super long term. I just want to experience WoW leveling experience and do some raids/dungeons/pvp here and there. I dont think i will have enough time to commit to raiding every week .
---
I’ve never played WoW before so am wanting a good/fun leveling experience.
---
Can someone list some benefits of mage or rogue and which one will cater to my situation :o ?
---
Yes, as they don’t have to take the much longer and more dangerous route
---
This was my thought, initially, I thought they were just set to follow?
---
Wow classic isnt a new mmo, is an old mmo who people asked for, is not intended to have new content,  people wanted vanilla, vanilla must be.
---
Out of those two I'd likely check out warlock. I remember Mages were very squishy, though I've always read the amount of dots and toolkit make warlock be more difficult to play well than other classes.
---
at least we're level 60 lmao, get good noob
---
A high level alliance lock randomly helped me kill the Cyclonian for my WW axe. It was wholesome.
---
is it horde guild, give that shammy a sulfuras :D
---
Duskwood, wetlands, darkshore, and Westfall. I'd say usually the most played lower level zones where no one cares what their guild thinks about what they're saying.
---
All the time people get heavily focused on a hobby at the expense of time with their loved ones. It doesn’t mean anything really (unless it continues on for years or something) other than that “this new hobby is so exciting so it’s taking up a lot of my focus.”
---
It doesn’t automatically mean “I don’t love my wife” or “I love my hobby more than my wife.”
---
Hey bro do you wanna talk?
---
Anti negativity and yet promote BFA prejudice at the same time? Noice.
---
I've never played BFA, I was there in 2004 vanilla though.. does that give me a right to state my opinion oh benevolent one? Rhetorical question ofc, you've already exposed the kind of person you are with that dumbass blanket statement.. They are fun though aren't they millennial scum.

that is a prety good warrior weapon :V

Fair, but if he enjoys enchanting then I say let him enchant. I feel like stuff like this is what lead wow to be the streamlined mess retail is today, it may be harder/more expensive to level ench as you level, but it definitely isn't pointless. You'll see tangible results as you enchant your gear.

If it doesn’t harm someone else and it benefits your mental health, perhaps there’s nothing wrong with living you life in a video game. The people you’re making connections are real people and you’re forming real communities, and maybe that’s therapeutic to some people. It has been to me in the past.
---
Most modern Asian MMOs have that stuff.  I dont talk about slut stuff you see there all the time. i mean they have different and more interesting approach, where mage look like wizard and hunter look like hunter. Black desert has some pretty amazing examples for Wizards ( i know its a different type of graphics). As for the physics, you dont need full physics on clothing to make it look good. Some basic animation is enough. They renewed character models in MOP but didnt think of new approach to clothing and it really is dated.

The 2h mace from Uldaman's last boss is fantastic.
---
You should remember their names and not group with them in the future. And warn your guild. 
---
The beauty of classic is that reputation sticks with you.
---
You need 9 Sulfuron Ingot's before you can craft it. That's the main hurdle.
---
I'm not aware of one, but depending on what you need moved, there are options. For example Leatrix Plus allows you to move and resize a number of UI features.
---
Tanking wasn't that hard in dungeons in vanilla when I played. It was basically just charge, thunder clap/shout and then tabbing through targets laying down sunder armor.
---
I never did raids, but tanking in vanilla really was actually pretty easy.
---
Make sure you shower ❤️
---
I did it. Two times. 
---
You have to dropp the profession and skill it up again. The get a new specialization you have to use the pick and pick one.
---
Ahh ok that explains it, we were only around lvl 14 ish so im not sure if the warrior had many threat abilities lol. Yeah i should prob stay back a bit more. Thanks :)
---
‘No scope run’ turned my slightly chest wobbly low laughter rumble into an audible chuckle.
---
If it doesn’t harm someone else and it benefits your mental health, perhaps there’s nothing wrong with living your life in a video game. The people you’re making connections with are real people and you’re forming real communities, and maybe that’s therapeutic to some people. It has been to me in the past.
---
I would suggest that after a while, start making minor changes in your RL on the side and before you know it it all adds up to big changes.
---
I mean, it's pretty much impossible to verify if it is or isn't. Everyone just running to reddit "world first!" are just happy and showing off, but it's not really official   
---
Still neat. :)
---
Hey man, thank you for offering, but I'm fine. Dealing with this shit for years now, but nevertheless I'm touched by your offer.. thank you.
---
Warriors dont use it for PvE either so I fail to see your point.

That is a very fair price it’s annoying as fuck people asking for water mid dungeon when it takes your whole mana pool. You are the dick here bring your own water don’t abuse the mage.
---
How is your inv so clean
---
I have one bag full with quest items
---
Really, why *can't* we commit suicide by placing stranglekelp in our neck slot?
---
Is that linen cloth under 30c a piece?
---
Rough phases, but like another redditor says, it shall pass at some point.
---
Was waiting for some Counterattack boss to spawn and tried inviting some guy to our group and he kept declining.Boss spawned but he tagged him first and 4 more kolkars with him. We just ran away and waited untill they killed him which they did and we got our boss. Damn, it felt good.
---
Nah this was 2 different ones, we were only around lvl 14-15 so im not sure if the warrior had many threat generating abilities. Ive never played warrior so i didnt know their abilities haha
---
Save some pussy for the rest of us.
---
They do.
---
Part of the wow charm is taking stuff in as you go. See it as enjoying a movie for the first time. 
---
It took me almost a whole full year to ding 60 back in the day. Granted i was a little kid so I was easily side tracked.
---
If so buy all of it and turn it into linen bags and profit like hell.
---
What's the add-on for the multi bag ?
---
It was complete shit because it was made by WOW devs
---
Only hunters get the diplomatic option.  Tame that pup and let him live free!
---
Requires 11 points in destruction when the consensus is affliction is easily the best leveling spec for warlock.
---
It’s not a “gaming PC” but yes it will rum good.
---
No just 5 accounts.

Penises can still be victim to yeast infections.

Which pick do you mean, sorry? Do you mean the book that charges you the fee?

babby's first multiboxer experience lmao
---
Yes $75&gt;$15
---
babby hasn't played this game in 12 years lmao
---
You could look into hotw/ns (0/30/21 or 1/29/21)
---
Why comment when you are wrong?
---
I remember ages ago seeing a multi-boxing alliance paladin (4 identical chars working in unison) in low level WSG - they were running in their underwear and boxing enemies (without weapons i.e. unarmed combat), carrying the flag and owning the game. Had a good laugh, and should have screenshots about it in some old backup...
---
I guess it’s not really allowed but as they have to pay multiple subscriptions (for multiple accounts) it’s not really strictly enforced. And it leads to some quite funny situations.
---
I'm not sure why you would ever pull more than 2 mobs...  Throw a dagger to pull and use blade flurry to take them both out.
---
Yes i know, legion had some cool stuff but I still think wow fashion is very limited.
---
here take my upvote. why didnt i think of this lol
---
Level up to 25, find a rogue buddy and start ganking in Ashenvale.
---
Also, Wetlands is a pain to get to, but I had tons of fun at low lvls ganking Alliance.
---
I’ve edited my post.
---
Writing from phone with sausage fingers and still a bit tired xD
---
As with most online games it's not completely unique to the Barrens but that place is the cesspit of WoW. Most other zones people don't even chat at all.
---
In case you were unaware, you can get expert first aid by purchasing/finding a book, it's called under wraps or something. It will allow you to take your first aid to 225 and from there the trainer in your capital city can teach you silk bandages and you can buy another book,/recipe that teaches you heavy silk bandages. Both of these can generally be found on the AH for relatively cheap, just check under recipes them first aid.
---
Send pm if you need someone to talk to dude. 👍
---
can confirm, watching warriors live on the edge makes me nervous, gotta give em a leg up somehow.
---
What a c*nt. Probably someone who didn't play classic before and have no clue about teamplay and solidarity. 
---
Enjoy the game and don't let thoses trashs ruin your experience :)
---
Why off tank? Dude literally just tanked ony as main tank lol

---
There are some fights where crushing blows will absolutely murder druids
---
Sold everything :p
---
sometimes zooming your camera further out, and positioning it so that it's going out the cave can make it appear/minable.
---
Shaman, went ele/resto so I could heal instances as well as solo. I never have a problem getting into groups and soloing is essentially similar to a mage or priest. Elemental fury is amazing, clearcasting is nice but tricky to time chain lightning with it, windfury is still great even with a good dagger to finish off low mobs. Only downside is most of my gear has turned into cloth but this hopefully will change once mail armor is learned. 
---
For anyone else looking for a change from enhancement just put 5/5 into improved healing wave and gear yourself with lots of int. Always have two ranks of healing wave on your bar as well, that will get you through dungeons just fine
---
If there's anything this sub has taught me, it's there's a dude named Verigan and his fist game is on point.
---
Ah, thank you. So if I drop it and skill it back up, I'll still have to pay the fee that the book charges? Like 150g or something from what I remember?

I'm doing a rogue and warrior right now, and rogues 100% have it harder at low levels.
---
Not even close.
---
Bruh it took me like 30-45 mins of straight killing but ight.
---
Then perhaps it's time for me to get new glasses...
---
## bruh 💀💪💪💪💪
---
Ah fuck me this is good advice, I guess I'll just go collect the stuff off those mobs who're 6 levels higher than me then eh?
---
Arcane mage, pls lawd give me arcane blast
---
Just Google "classic piest leveling build" or something similar and you'll find a plethora of videos/sites that will help you out. A lot can depend on your play style, e.g do you prefer dungeon grinding or questing? Generally as a priest levelling solo you'll want to invest in the shadow tree, as you can heal instances and still put out enough damage to quest.
---
And most of the time the items will just be stuck in the hour long mail queue.. :P
---
Well not everyone is minmaxing, people who never played the game take way longer and maybe read the quest text?
---
Its funny that blizz thinks that giving me a max lvl character is what I would even want. I'm playing classic because I dont want everything to be handed to me on a silver platter.
---
They still announced it giving everyone the same amount of time to prepare.
---
The best single serving friends.
---
Back in vanilla, I had a really twinked out paladin I was leveling, and this cocky hunter was doing /laugh and being an ass and saying paladins were freekill for hunters and all that. Was around lvl 35-40.
---
Motherfucker actually duel challenged me, and to assert dominance I first killed his cat, THEN I beat him. /spit
---
You don't ''figure out'' how to not die to mobs much higher than your level.
---
You don't get to make fun of people for the way they play wow if you don't even know what level the mobs in an area are ffs.
---
yes thats how it was. for 6+ targets you just spam shout.

I just wanna do Cathedral on my Hunter, but everyone is busy doing AoE runs on graveyard or armory.

I'm not even getting rejected, just straight up nobody looking for group in the lfg channel
---
No fee, no quest anymore.
---
You just pick one specialization.
---
This was my thought, I mean sulf is nice, but it will be ages before he gets it done, BUT THE GIRDLE IS THERE RIGHT NOW.
---
I've seen that bug several times now at hunters
---
There's absolutely no reason to go into resto before 40, since healing in dungeons is about the gear not the talents.  You'll need two sets of gear, leveling and healing.
---
Don't fall for bonus healing over stats.  You're better off with as much spirit and intellect as possible, or you'll go oom when you need to root a runner.
---
You live near your friends and family? And they have a BBQ and invite you over? Wow you're lucky
---
what the hell is layer hopping?

I would have said "it says i cant join because you full :( "

I never got that quest but I fought that dog several times just because it was there.
---
Paladin here, you warriors are still better than us with your charge.
---
Wish I could get this as a Shaman 😭
---
Sometimes ya gotta pull what ya gotta pull
---
I had to tank WC as an arms warrior who had a 2h axe... handled it pretty easily tbf and I dont like tanking
---
Why would it be sarcasm? Why should the names be blacked out in this screenshot and not others?
---
I was going to say asking about BFD into the void hit close to home. No one wants to do it.
---
I don't want to be a dick or anything...but where can I see the video of you tanking Ony? I don't deny you didn't do it, just want to see how you did it, like damage taken, raid composition, how healers mana worked, etc.
---
All I see is a pic of Ony dead, and a statement " I tanked Ony as a Druid".
---
Might as well been a pic of Ony with the " I tanked Ony with my pet".
---
So, again, Druids are fine tanks. Still light years weaker than Warriors, but they are fine. I just want to see HOW fine they are, and a pic of a dead Ony is not exactly proof of anything, except that a raid killed Ony.
---
nah fuck you.
---
I'd have kicked your lazy ass.
---
Swiftness pots should sell good
---
If you pull more than 2, kill one and vanish, then pull two next time.
---
What do you mean by ''the problem'' though?
---
What exactly is the negative result of (a stark minority of) people levelling in dungeons? Are you sure you're not a bit to eagerly searching for the irony and saying there's a problem where there actually isn't? 
---
This happened 10 years ago just like it's happening now.
---
You have no basis to say he didn't get there first. Plenty of groups form before they get to the mob.  The picture doesn't say anything about who got there first, so you just assume he didn't, and then go on a huge rant about how big a piece of shit he is, based on just your assumption. 
---
Frankly, you are being an even bigger dick than what he would be by doing what you accuse him of.
---
There's no confirmation but blizzard brazilian Facebook postes that for the 15y event you'd get a free lvl110 boost and BFA upon reaching lvl60 in classic.
---
Was taken down shortly after but it make so much sense that i think it'll happen
---
Don't forget that the event introduce 3 raids (maybe lfr, no detail yet as they aren't available for testing on the ptr) each with 3 bosses from BC, Wotlk and cata as well as an older version of the alterac valley which you can join from lvl20 onward and get scaled up to lvl120 (still weaker but you're not useless either)
---
Oh right and clearing all 3 raids will reward you with an exclusive Deathwing mount, imo currently one of the best mount in the game.
---
Offering a free 110 boost to Classic players who want to take part in the event makes sense don't you think ?
---
First test I’ve ever felt prepared for.
---
Currently playing on a 2017 13” MBA. Runs surprisingly well, stable 40-60 fps
---
Just as good?
---
Overreaching much?
---
Do mods clean up these twitch clips with clickbait titles?
---
Click here to find out!
---
Call it what you want. I have stopped to inspect more people here in classic because “Oh snap what shoulders this mans have??” 100x more often than I ever did in retail.
---
This is great! Last week I gave a lvl 10 warrior dwarf called "Eric Cartmann" 15 silver, because he needed money to train two-handed hammer! He is now in my friends list!

Figured someone would say that, probably should have mentioned that in the rotation idea. Thx anyway.

Whisper them and report them is the work around, though that seems like an awesome idea. I hope it happens.
---
At which level?

We always said "member" but I've heard peeps say "more" as well. 
---
This will be the next VC vs DM I'm telling ya now 😂
---
Ah amazing, thank you!
---
If I were being selfish I would ask for Deathknights or other classes being available to both sides because I don't seem to mesh with any of the current ones which doesn't really help.  
---
For the game overall though I don't think it would hurt the game to implement a guild bank and transmog but then again that might all be part of the classic experience I don't know I didn't play Vanilla.
---
Unfortunately, the seeds of the issues that plague Retail were planted all the way in BC, even though we didn't realize it.
---
Huge stat inflation with massive horizontal gear progression instead of vertical progression, ten entire levels and an entire new zoned-off area to get them in, heavily themed expansion area, introduction of direct WarCraft characters as PvE antagonists...every expansion followed this paradigm and it's been what's expected of every expansion.
---
They should have focused heavily on making more content and plot lines original to WoW, expanded or added more zones to Azeroth instead of making a complicated layer cake of separate expansion content, try to keep the same level cap or not increase it every expansion, etc. 
---
If only we could've recognized it earlier.
---
That game was awesome!
---
Yea but alot of people don't play like that, and choose classes based off what they find interesting and don't really do research at all. Some enjoy playing games on a much more casual level.

---
Again this is wrong because 90% of private server guilds used a feral Druid. No one used a bear in retail vanilla. Private servers showed that druids can shine in raids as a tank.
---
Should the 30s be so hard? 1-10 was extremely easy and 20-30 wasn't that hard either but now i'm leveling really slow. I'm lvl 33 now and quests are all so far away in different zones, i just finished Desolace and quests were sending me all over the zone for very little exp, does it get easier later on or am i just really bad at leveling? About 8 hours to get 2 levels.
---
"rape that thing in bacon"
---
go on...
---
I would do the same :)
---
Did he clipped them to your nipples?
---
More the opposite, I want to learn tanking and healing really well. But doing good dps is also a thing I follow,  just not my main prio.
---
Sorry apparently I wasn’t responding to the comment I was trying to.  Somebody said that all we have are warriors, druids and shamans.  But I get it it’s just the alliance counterpart.
---
This is why I usually make my own parties. ;)

Hey thanks mate. I'll keep note of this.
---
But honestly on a whole gaming just isn't accepted, even in 2019 where I am from. Just gotta take it in stride.
---
Mage has Rez sickness. He’s severely severely handicapped. Most likely he didn’t know how much it affected him or if he did he was just hoping he had enough damage still. 
---
This video is lackluster.
---
Not on Classic though.
---
Dad you didn't say what server you're on xx
---
Thank you kindly. You guys are amazing.
---
Does it work in instaces though?
---
As a tank I'm with you.
---
Sadly some retail gogogo minster mindset spilled off to classic.
---
Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.
---
Why do you care how others level? Gatekeeper as fuck
---
This is the exact reason I cast Renew, the spell gets shit on a lot for reasons I don't think it deserves.
---
As you said, in a vacuum Renew is less mana efficient, but I'm not healing in a vacuum, I'm healing in a very dynamic ever-changing battlefield. If I can slap a Renew on the tank and let my MP5 take over that *is* more efficient than spamming Lesser Heal at whatever rank. 
---
If the DPS takes some AoE damage and I need to top them off giving everyone an instant cast Renew and getting to my MP5 before the next fight *is* more efficient than 5+ casts of Lesser Heal over 15+ seconds.
---
Yes. I didn't know what to name my char. So I panicked. And I like cheese.

Art direction is separate from quality imo. WoW is highly stylized but is also well executed. I haven't watched much BDO or played at all, because from what I can tell it's a dumpster fire, but given that it's over a decade newer I'm not surprised it has more detailed clothing animations. 
---
I don't think WoW looks as good as BDO, but I do think it looks good. Textures in particular are far better than they were in vanilla. In my opinion, modern WoW, in a technical sense, ignoring personal taste, looks inarguably better than vanilla WoW.
---
But this all comes down to taste, clearly.
---
Should be OK if you know what you're doing, bear in mind the last boss is level 34
---
What's the point of breaking it down this?
---
Please do tell me when slam is useful : )
---
During leveling there are many more useful spells to get and you'll be saving for your mount so obviously you don't waste your precious gold on SLAM. The moment you get lvl 40 and your mount you get Mortal Strike so now there is even less of a reason to ever use slam, nothing should survive MS into Whirlwind at this point and you will likely not have the rage to spare. By the time you reach 60 you want to respec to DW fury where slam is even more worthless, so please do tell me why do you try to make this person who is clearly new to warrior in classic waste his gold?
---
Yes thats it. For some reason I dont have those borders with the default UI.

Ah never change

That sounds like a very good deal. Yes it'll run wow classic fine. I'm currently playing wow classic on a pc that's nearly 10 years old! No problems at all on ultra settings.

Or logging onto another character and wasting the corpse camper's time

Absolutely. Vale was amazing aesthetically and the scarring absolutely made it horrendous.

you are a good person and have moral values. the rest of the posters are corrupted and will justify ninjaing cause ME NEDD MOUNT
---
if only every player would be like you
---
Don't worry, FlowerPower9000 clearly isn't getting laid either.
---
You mean one demo shout then spam battle shout while tab sundering and revenge’ing
---
Stance dancing?  Probably.   It's hard to keep up threat without the def stance threat bonus, and a clothy will almost undoubtedly pull off of you, and you'll have to taunt off less they take a beating while you try to build threat on one mob.  Cleave is your friend, thunderclap is OK, rend everything, and use skulls and Xs to show your DPS who you'll have the most threat against.  Shield bash is pretty helpful, and Disarm imo is essential.  Charge is fun but I find it's not the most useful tanking move
---
My dream is they create more vanilla raids but there is probably a 0% chance of that happening.
---
It was from the latest Classicast that featured Omar.
---
Sorry bro, I'm fresh out of cookies.
---
You can gave this, though:

Look at Bbaron from fusion on northdale. Fusion was easily one of the best alliance guilds on northdale and they used a feral throughout northdales timeline. Stop speaking from your ass when you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
There's at least 3 more posts asking this same question
---
The Jukes!
---
Would u give this weapon to a ret?
---
Start your own group?
---
Venruki and Emongg are really great to watch. Both are professional and laid back, low drama. Super chill streams, great content.
---
I am talking about 10-40 mob pulls not 3-4
---
A ret
---
He means epic lol
---
Yeah its beatiful. Dont know why people dislike Darkshore so muc
---
He didnt, went to me another dps warrior :D
---
He's giving you the "you have really rolled alliance" look.
---
Oh then why bother? You can’t hold those against 3 mages aoe’ing
---
Funny its also my wallpaper ;)
---
I had a warrior in SM last night, he was 4 levels higher than me and the 2 mages, but by only spamming demo shout he held threat over my Hellfire which by itself is impressive.
---
Enjoy my friend! Be wary of the server queues tho.
---
Lmao pls don't tell me you're honestly being this stupid.
---
It's an *amazing* elemental shaman level 39 twink item as the ele wont be able to wear axes or maces but still wants a hard hitting 2hander when chasing clothis.
---
I was under the impression that once he's mind controlled, friendly units can then speak to him
---
Hold onto it! Grats
---
So you'll generally be doing a minimal amount of stance dancing in dungeons. Usually I just charge in, swap to defensive stance either demo shout if there's like 3 or more mobs or battle shout if it's down/there are a lot of melee. BS actually has the potential to generate more threat than demo if people are in range, as the threat generated is determined from the amount of allies it effects. Another thing I almost forgot is sweeping strikes, generally a good idea for AoE is to charge in, bloodrage if it's up, pop sweeping strikes then go to defensive stance and sunder armor/cleave as necessary. Sunder armor is obviously going to be your primary concern in single target but with multiple targets you'll also want to sprinkle them throughout the mobs by tab targeting. I also will generally use overpower when it's up as the high chance to crit can net you some good threat as well as just the raw damage it does, but it's not a priority.. Keep in mind as a tank unless you're obsessing over aggro at the cost of efficiency you will lose aggro on some mobs. All that matters is that the group doesn't wipe and you taunt them off the healer. Other than that remember to use revenge when it's up, and if it's a huge pull or a lot of damage use shield block/shield wall if it's a really dire situation. Another thing to be aware of is you can only keep 25 rage when you switch stances (assing you have points in tactical mastery), so dont mindlessly dance and throw away all your rage.
---
They shouldn't be too hard, but they are slow.

Yesterday I saw a guy kill a boss spawn. I waited, missed one to another guy, waited, first guy comes back with a party, no room for me. I call him an asshole for taunting me. He invites me to group before it spawns. It gets low and he kicks me, I still got the quest.
---
How much could Gut Ripper go for on the AH?
---
Yea but you dont need loot boxes. Its not like EA where the loot gives ACTUAL upgrades. You're just getting skins and you regularly get loot boxes just by playing. They have pretty big free updates all the time like uprising, summer/winter/Halloween etc. They give you boxes for playing arcade, tanks, healers etc. Overwatch loot boxes aren't a problem. They put them in pretty easy to earn and aren't a necessity
---
cool thanks
---
People are playing the game they want to play it my dude. I quests from 1-30 but hit a brick wall when I couldn't progress in any zone due to constant ganking. I was forced into instances from 30-45 because of that, but I actually had a pretty nice time because I was running dungeons with my friends and hanging out in voice. 
---
It's almost like one of the major points of WoW is that you can play however you want, as long as you're having fun.
---
I'm open to start on a new one I'm only 15 lock atm.
---
I’ve waited years for this haha, an hour or two in a queue is nothing!
---

Moooooooooooo

at least you got 7 copper for that

Looking for an addon to show each party members target beside their name, I don't want a a whole new UI as I like the default.
---
btw if you want to leave or join a channel type "/join (insert number here)" or "/leave (insert number here)". General chat is usually "1" and trade chat (in cities) is usually "2".
---
I don't think so..it was a hardware limitation of the past. The "fog of war" is something in a RTS game for competitive reasons, it has no place in a MMO.
---
My happiness is slaying alliance scum in stranglethorn and hillsbrad.
---
Mwahahahahahahaha I AM HAPPINESS!
---
And those Raids will be in Retail, if I'm understanding this correctly? 
---
I'm really close to just snag it anyway, since I will probably want to get comfy with my character until these Raids begin.
---
So instead of instructing that guy on how exactly escort quests can be done in party you decided to fuck him over? You do realize that many players don’t understand how to share escort quests, right? I’m not surprised that from his point of view you really are a scumbag. Imagine being such an asshole to steal a quest and then ask guildies to spoil somebody’s day.
---
Not everyone plays with pushing basic vanilla raid content as the end goal my friend! The joy of the game is what matters and druids are very fun to play and perform well in all group sizes. If you're focused on min maxing definitely play whatever class sims the best for the current meta.
---
&gt;nobody wants to watch leveling
---
ah yes, the ever so entertaining 8h SM cath spam streams
---
It is only considered cheating when in interrupts the gaming experience of others. This was the response like 2-3 years ago because of PvP
---
If you and a thing trying to hit you is moving in the same direction, the thing trying to hit you gets increased melee range.
---
Rend is awful and rage can be spent on better things, and charge is critical to generating the rage necessary to stockpiling a nice piece of aggro right of the bat, walking up and waiting for your white swings/damage to generate aggro is going to result in being rage starved and losing aggro.
---
You do realize they run in the same sub, right?
---
I swear they're just upset people are enjoying the game more than them. Boomers are salty that people can farm dungeons for 10 levels straight and still have the time of their lives while they're stuck in STV getting ganked the 2 hours they're allowed to play after work.
---
World pvp has never been fair.

Back in vanilla I had the halberd of smiting. Which was a polearm with that sword spec proc. I was in arathi basin and charged a gnome mage. The halberd procced twice on my first auto attack and all of them crit. That mage got obliterated in just the mini stun from charge.

15 undead lock on thunderfury
---
It's not a rep, it's more like pvp rank on earlier patches. Meaning it's grindy af and months worth of progress can decay in a week of neglect.
---
To be honest, if I was a priest, if mind control literally every mob I could find to see if they'd have a useful buff or something, if I saw one mob had the ability "teach smelting: elementium" I'd definitely want a miner in on it haha
---
It's rough until you hit 20 (cat form) but at that point it really takes off. I've been doing all 3 dungeon roles while leveling whenever I want to hop in to a group. Make sure you use lower rank heal spells in addition to your higher rank spells so that you only spend as much mana as you need to. That applies to all of the healers.
---
Are you on a new server ?
---
You need some 10s bags or something bro? You seem angry.
---
Just Google pre raid holy priest his vanilla. There should be some pretty informative guides.
---
Yup right on. Orcs are the only race that don't have a suitable mount.
---
That poor wolf cant hold a 300 lb orc and his equipment. 
---
Plus it just looks silly. Increasing the size of the wolf by 50% when orcs ride would be perfect.
---
Amen
---
The Forsaken are "morally grey" like that. 
---
They may have their tragic reasons and whatnot, but I think it's just fun to play such cartoonishly evil characters.
---
A former friend and GM ginvited my friends after my and their guild disbanded. I asked if I could join too and he said "no".
---
This GM did a lot of shady stuff, yet people thought gold shone from his arse.
---
So every Christmas, I'd roll a level 1 on his server and earn enough money to buy Coal to mail to him.
---
I regret not calling him out directly. I suppose I didn't want to burn any bridges. I didn't consider there were no bridges to begin with.
---
This is about the same story as how I got my axe. Except then the enemy horde group that had helped me kill it demolished me right after i looted the heart. I guess they earned that one lol.
---
ofc you can

Kylebro always activating that trinket that gives you more dmg I think :)

On Gehennas EU these go for less than 150g, decent money but pretty far off 900
---
A potato can run Classic, so you have nothing to worry about.
---
You can always pull one and make the others evade by running away while only doing damage to the one mob.
---
The whole event will happen only in retail, but not much more is known beside the bosses inside each raid as the next patch was seemingly stopped to help with classic launch.
---
Release date is estimated to be anywhere between mid september and early october so you should be able to learn more about the event if you take a look at wowhead news around early october.
---
As a mage, this wouldn't work. I can kite for days, Ice Block all threat off of me, and just keep running and cause a lot of problems for the group.
---
However, I wouldn't do this cause it's a dick move. I've made water for everyone for free, even if they don't ask I offer. Most people actually tip for it, too, which I don't even expect. It takes me a spell cast, it's not too hard. Only thing I'd want to be paid for is portals because that actually costs me some money.
---
I think it's ridiculously overrated 13 year old edgelord trash that was only ever funny because we were all once the 13 year old edgelords, and we were in that world. Some still are. But it's far, far more obnoxious than it is funny for me.
---
This. Though you can get the rock pulverizer around 35 if you have a friend really good 2h mace lasted me a few levels til I got Bonebiter.
---
ASSmongold would kick him because he loves to pretend classic is BFA
---
&gt;If you need drops it's almost worse being in a group.
---
Probably depends on the class, but I've found grouping up with another is more than doubling the kill-speed. And that's as a feral druid killing stuff faster than most classes with zero downtime.   
---
Grouping with others gives them zero downtime, because whatever role they excel at, I can complement.   
---
A priest (or caster in general) I will cat/bear depending on mob-count, feeding him kills. A melee I'll cat/healer, and so on.
---
Don't listen to replies mate, go at your own pace
---
He specifically asked for a class that performs well in dungeons and raids and druids are not all that wanted in either due to the subpar healing ability as well as the inability to ress. I don't know how it is to level, but the endgame viability leaves something to be desired.
---
My vote is for DB: Defias Brotherhood!
---
Just pick a lower server jezus cheist
---
That's really all we've got to work with. Just help spread the word on how to ignore to your friends, though. Those popups will annoy the hell out of someone eventually.
---
Need to have over 9000 in herbalism to pick it...

Actually no, but this is not BFA. You kill the other faction.

Never been a secret. I used this to farm for my mount back in 2006.

For SM, at the current character power level, once you get 36 it’s pretty easy to hold threat even if you are using a 2h.

This should give you a decent footing on all of the mobs, generating lots of rage and when you notice mobs break off of you, you can simply stance dance to taunt/mocking blow.

If you mean, a direct exit to Azshara, like the way it is in Battle for Azeroth (and has been like so in retail for a number of expansions i believe), there is no such thing in vanilla (classic) wow.
---
There is an entrance from Durotar on the south side, the huge gate. And there is one on the west side which leads to a bridge to Barrens. You go west from the windrider master through the bridge, go past the PvP house and the trolls following the road west.
---
Hope this helps. Cheers

Keep strong, I live in a country where acceptance for gaming is not bad (but might still seem childish). I work remotely, found a smart girl with similar attitude to life (which is rare here) and now, we're playing both in WoW Classic. Try to live the way you want, even if it means to limit interactions with society. Happiness should be your priority, even when most tell you that you should behave differently.
---
I like how you could've taken a picture using your computer but instead pulled out your mobile.

This is what horde do. Perhaps it's karmic.

Agreed. D;

My brother didn’t have it there straight away either. Try restart your Battle.net client and update it

Combat swords is still the best spec to level with regardless of anything else.
---
There’s zero Alliance players on Herod lmao. You guys are literally playing with yourself.
---
We went for the mallet with a group of lvl 42-44s. After a crapload of corpse runs and teaming up with an alliance group to clear elites one by one at the altar we made it. Best experience of vanilla so far ( not to mention we came all the way from tanaris for this shit )
---
Can you share the video? I am thinking of trying to solo it soon :D

Thank you for this wonderful idea satan

---
Any way to have your pet attack when I shoot something with my hunter?  Can it only attack by manually pressing the c-1 'attack' button?
---
Umm... At the only place where you can really get into Desolace from the water. Just swim out more and come around it to get onto land.
---
It's trash, just C.O.D. it to my character for vendor price &lt;3
---
For the time being, layers are used as a way to alleviate queue times. Basically what's happening is that each server has 5 copies or "layers" running at the same time. It's all the same server but here's different instances of it to thin out the population in each area.
---
Let's say you and I are on the same server in the same place. You're telling me where you're standing and I'm in the same spot but I don't see you. We're on different layers of the same server. If you invite me to your party, I'll be moved into your layer and an entire new set of played will spawn in.
---
People are using that mechanic to camp things like rare mobs or resources and quickly farm them. Say we're on different layers and we both have a rare mob spawn. I'll kill mine, get the loot/xp, you invite me to your party, I switch layers and the rare mob spawns in again, we kill it, then wait for our other friend to invite us to a different layer. You can keep doing this all over the map and tack stuff up very quickly which totally ruined the economy.
---
Öhm... This isn't a word in German but if it were, I'd argue it's coming from "backen" (baking) so it would be a "Bakepack" full of baking supplies.

Jesus, if 6 takes you longer than 20 minutes you should just go ahead and uninstall.

Awesome. Thanks for the added details.

Bit of a collectors item, that. You rarely see an alliance dog trying to do anything alone. They won’t leave stormwind unless they’re holding hands with at least 2 other people normally.

Backfired too! (Although the mage has ress sickness and was awful!)

Same here, I usually unload all my conjured food/water on the nearest player if I'm about to log. Can't use it anymore.

You're not supposed to in a reasonable amount of time. Epic mounts are supposed to be an achievement you work towards.
---
In wow universe that fear is quite well resoned with all those nzoth hellspawns
---
Hmm, you seem to be projecting here. I'm having an amazing time thank you though. What a weird way to attempt to insult someone lol.
---
I'd say so, they are very sought after in dungeons and part of the aoe dungeon meta. Rogues on the other hand can often struggle to find groups due to large amounts of rogues and that rogues have limited utility in a group. 
---
One thing to keep in mind though is that mages have a lot of downtime and will spend a lot of time drinking between mobs. This is personally why I end up bored with mages and never reached 60 on one.
---
If you want to pvp while leveling rogues are the kings of world pvp since they pick the time and place for the fight and have lots of tools to use for a skilled player.

I don’t like being told your way is the only way to enjoy the game, yeah I’m a big ol retard
---
Anecdotal story - you don't actually know what the tank was doing, you've just assumed he was spamming demo shout, when infact he was probably tanking properly, and if 2 mages are AOEing the mobs would move so slowly that they would never reach the mages anyway
---
Keep your gear that you replace with "of shadow wrath" stuff and it will help alot with healing if you can switch back to it when needed.
---
Can add to what has been said that it only seems possible to reset at capital city trainers. For example on my druid I teleported to Moonglade to reset but the trainer there wouldn't offer it. When I instead visited the trainer in Stormwind I could do it.
---
 Also costed 1g. Was expecting first respec to be free but not the case. Guess free first respec is a private server thing.
---
nah, it's not.
---
If you don’t hit 6 in 6 minutes or less why even play?
---
If you’re horse, shaman is a good choice for sustain.
---
Going a long way to disprove my point there.
---
You should be leveling as combat swords.
---
And I shouldn't have a zone where I cannot do absolutely anything, either shoot or melee but here we are.
---
No changes and git gud.
---
I’ve learned that there is a mace in Gnomeregan thats pretty good for druids. Im way past that now but im wondering, is it worth to go back and farm it?
---
Ok i will take that into consideration.
---
I dont really plan on playing long term thats the thing. Just want an easy leveling experience and then do some dungeons and raids (but not hardcore)
---
If its hard to find groups as a rogue. I might just play mage instead
---
you have azeroth auto pilot enabled.
---
On full you gotta search just as long for a tank. Yesterday I've seen a SFK group with 2 warriors searching for a tank.....
---
Warris just don't wanna tank nowadays.
---
Ill keep the mace in mind, thanks. But Im just lvl 34 right now.
---
I'm a hunter and it's pretty easy to get a group if you just go to SM. GEneral chat people are less picky since they're already there and just want to start
---
I think the thing with the no changes is does it detract, or significantly change the vanilla experience? A calander must moves something we would do or if the game into the game.
---
I get that many people think it's a slippery slope, but if that's the case we're already sliding.
---
Don't shield the warrior except in the direst emergencies, he needs to get hit to generate rage/threat.
---
And yeah, mind blast causes double threat.
---
Help! I want to play Wow Classic, but it keeps telling me: 'active game time is required in order to play wow classic' -- How can I play as a complete new beginner wow classic? I want to try it.
---
Why are you trying to pull 3-4 mobs and even mentioned elites? Are you obsessed with having some sort of MLG reputation?
---
Rage capped execute because you were afk autoattacking and not using any abilities. Truly riveting gameplay.
---
The riding skill is the expensive part.   That's the part that cost 900g.  The mount is only 100g.
---
Now start saving for that epic mount
---
What exactly is a macro?
---
You can't modify friendly nameplates in instances in Classic. The addon author wound need to fix this issue.
---

---
You didn't have to select your server every time you logged in in 2005.
---
0.22 s or 22c on my realm per cloth at the moment is the cheapest buyout yeah
---
You have to be subscribed to play classic. The game is free (as opposed to the expansion) but it still requires a sub.
---
If you're switching targets, you're no longer on the combo you're maintaining.
---
Convincing argument.
---
now you are in trouble...
---
Mobile phone internet not working?
---
That's part of rogue balance in classic. If you could swap off targets to CC or something and maintain points on first target they would be made significantly stronger.
---
That's what happened on Planetside 2 a lot. If one faction on a server was significantly overpopulated then the other two factions ganged up on them all the time.
---
So i can't play until level 20 like the normal wow for free, right ? I need to buy a monthly subscription to play it ? Ok, thanks.
---

---
I use better vendor prices. Works well!
---
Are you alliance or horde?
---
From what other friends of mine have observed there is no trial for classic.
---
haha this will never end,i wish we live in the world people stop  generalizing .
---
I’m by no means an expert rogue, but I’m leveling as a combat swords rogue. Meaning I have two swords, the one with slower attack speed and higher dmg in my main hand. If you ALWAYS have someone to play with and that person can tank you should probably use daggers and backstab enemies. 
---
However, if you’re mostly solo like me, swords and sinister strike is most likely the way to go to deal the most dps. I try to always have slice n dice up to deal a lot of white damage and then finish the enemy with eviscerate.
---
So I'm bored at work and saw this and decided to complete it as more of a personal introspection. I don't expect anybody to read it but feel free to do so.

I got my mount at 40 with 21g spare by: being picky with my spells. Only levelling skinning and mostly vendoring it. Selling greens on AH. 
---
Wasn't too bad. Only ever ran each dungeon once, never spammed em.
---
Ok thanks thats a lot better!
---
Up voted for funny, but very unpractical.
---
Feral druid can be fun, leveling is easier than rogue or warrior between sustain and not glancing. For pvp, druids generally end up as a mixed bag for 1v1, multi spec between feral and resto to have the best of both worlds with 1/29/21 or a flag running spec deeper in resto. One annoying thing early on is shifting is 20% of your Mana pool
---
How bad is it being a ally warlock and dealing with will of the forsaken? I'm on a PvP server and want to do a lot of PvP late game. My friends swapped to ally last minute and screwed over my pick as orc warlock. I don't like that my main cc ability can be countered by a large majority of the horde. So I'm deciding between hunter or mage now. What do you guys think? I just want to play a really solid PvP class/race combo.
---
There's an NPC that tells you about him if you have one of the bindings in your inventory, can't remember what's he called, he's a high elf.
---

---
Yes it has so far when the world is full of lowbies and the majority of players are between 30 and 50.
---
I am talking about the endless spam that happens in two of the biggest channels in the game and the fact that in a few months when most people are 60 and start raiding it's going to be a tough task to find groups for everything one might want.
---
transfers are worse on dead servers, not enough people transfer to fix the server, just enough to hurt it.
---
netherwind just got its realm firsts ruined to add a few people to the server and a buncha ah items tanked in price, we're stilll low pop, and guilds are disbanding to join the transfer guild lead by the realm first xfer 60's
---
kill mobs
---
That is actually a point. Don’t remember TBC that well anymore, thought flying was necessary to a certain extent. When not, then go for it
---
This is why we play Priest.
---
thanks.
---
Weird. When I saw this post and looked at the picture first, I saw what you first thought it is. After I read the title I can't see the shadowy man at all anymore.
---
It doesn't seem to show up, just says "Try for Free" and tried right clicking the wow icon (on the side bar) but nothing shows up about Classic...
---
How do the world dragons fit in with raid bosses in terms of difficulty and loot? I cant imagine that they're too valuable since you could "cheat" and kill it with 100 people.
---
I do agree. I even struggle a bit as a level 13 warrior. I was there at 11 even and it was hell on earth, even with fighting mobs my own level. 
---
I have read a guide for warrior and that guy recommend loch modan instead of west fall. So that’s where I am going now. Reason being simpler quests.
---
In addition. I don’t like the look of the dust bowl westfall. Koch modan is nice, green and mountains
---
Add +5 to all levels.
---
you don't need rep in vanilla. alll boses are easibly killed in dungeon blues and some greens
---
Not only thats not illegal, but blizz loves it. Only time they will get warned is when they disrupt gameplay like the 40 sham multyboxer when he locked down entrance to sw .
---
Are there any quests in particular I should be doing when leveling? I'm a tauren druid at level 20 atm.
---
I don't associate with gold sellers or those that deal with them.
---
Bonereavers edge is better.
---
FWIW, I think that little things like that will help the stage for classic+, instead of pushing to a BC patch. We have to get the dev's involved in taking this a better way.
---
What? No. Raid bosses on private servers have been confirmed to be significantly harder.
---
U still doing that combo lol . I mean you get 3 comb points on that enemy give the next enemy a kick to the face and keep on hitting back the first, its still a combo.
---
Whats the matter in retail and bc are rogues not doing combos or what?
---
The drivers are so buggy they've been known to cause this problem for about 9 years and still haven't been fixed.
---
FYI, this problem doesn't happen only with WoW, you just don't happen to play the other games it happens with apparently. But yes, keep trying to go 'WOW BAD' instead of actually noticing that nvidia cards have had this problem for near on a decade.
---
Truefaith is better than t2, unless you have the other 7 pieces.
---
Around 30 :)
---
i just go into the ironforge tram and kill rats....   makes me feel good inside
---
You can't. Private server bug caused that. It makes your wand hits way slower
---
are you using an add on to color code your chat? i’ve had mine color coded for what feels like forever but i can’t seem to find it in classic? i’ve looked at chat settings and can’t find it
---
Westfall is your wake up call. You're out of the starting zone and into the real world.
---
Just kidding, contested zones are where the real fun begins!
---
The epic 40 shaman multyboxer - wow x40 - 1600$ + monthly 600$/month . Now tell me how blizz can tell that its bad
---
Res is 10s heals are 5s
---
Try to close the game, close and launch battle.net then open the game it may register the changes
---
When another melee is in range and you  just press a mouse button on him for whatever reason , youre fucked ..
---
If you want to save zones to experience on alts, you will have to grind or run dungeons to make up for the xp loss.
---
Try to think of it like this. If you spend 10 days grinding rep with your dwarf, a human would reach the same rep in 9 days.
---
He's leveling with Bannon.
---
Also with 4 locks you only have a 26% chance ;)
---
Yes wotf is OP
---
I thought it was an underwater herb before i read
---
They're joking, 20 gold isn't even much for a single lvl 60, but for a 40 man raid its actually useless, just 50 silver each.
---
Did you just compare a controlled fantasy environment to reality?
---
Perfect hunter weapon!
---
Papi on Whitemane AMA
---
I'm lvl 23 Nelf Priest (PvP server) wit Herbalism+Alchemy but after doing some research it seems that people don't don't recommended taking Alchemy on main. Apparently, raw materials are worth more than pots, is that true? Should I swap it for something else?
---
It’s at a given time and the population is at its lowest for US East servers around this then as most people are sleeping that play there.
---
No, they have said only that it will never be longer than the initial length.
---
That’s actually not bad, considering the horrendous clown looks we all have in classic lol
---
I love sending friends I partied with a boar liver with the text: "you're next"
---
Wait, you can actually use gift wrap to wrap things? I thought it was just some RP item..
---
You need to have 81 gold to accidentally buy. If his guy was really planning to fool buyers, he should choose lower amount because the amount of people who have 81 gold, and are looking for stacks of wool is insanely low.
---
Thank god you wrote it a 3rd time rather than just upvoting the other 2 😂
---
Yeah i love it as well but thats a little thing i find really disappointing :P
---
Still dont see a reason to justify such a buff to rogues because you are clicking everything with mouse
---
I was in SM not long ago in the general chat someone said “don’t inv *****, is a ninja looter” and that how the guy hardly find party for dungeon now 
---
Reputation among players is a thing in classic :D
---
Can't get feared off boat.
---
Nothing more rewarding than planting a seed and watch the plant grow big.
---
You sit your ass down and heal after you have drank.
---
The whole group does not need to wait for me to have full mana in order for the dungeon to have some form of progress being made.
---
It takes a good while before a tank actually needs to be healed in these dungeons.
---
Depends on the faction. If you're not going for exalted with Darnassus or doing timbermaw/TB rep grinds then it's not a big deal. Stuff like Brood of Noz are really fast once you start raiding in aq40 for example.
---
I was that poor back in 2006, I was an idiot who only looted items if they were greens or higher.
---
I get that you can do it, he's a warlock though so making due with what he can get as 2nd pre bis because it will be replaced right away in mc is fine as he would like to switch to alchemy.  It's not going to hurt him.  Saves all the resources to get to the robe, acquiring the pattern, actually making it.  It's a lot of time involved for something that could be replaced right away.
---
Yep same here. Every once in a while I’ll do something seemingly insignificant but suddenly I’ll get waves of nostalgia of doing that exact same thing as a kid and I’ll see myself doing that same action in my old room and the relieved feeling of having all my homework done for the weekend and knowing I can just spend the entire time playing wow and not worrying about anything. 
---
But otherwise it just feels like I’m playing a good version of wow
---
Ever hit you that some people wants to play this MMO in an MMO setting? Perhaps you and the other 28 players are getting a bit lonely on Azuresong and thats why you are so salty :P
---
There's no rhyme or reason to many quest descriptions. It's not a matter of using your brain it's a matter of wandering enough until you happen to find them.
---
Gratzzz
---
Holy shit is thought is never see the day! Thanks for the heads up
---
Mostly because I wasn't sure if other people were seeing the same thing, or if there was a config line you could add to auto-select the server.
---
This, end of discussion.
---
Elwynn chat: "lfg hogger"
---
Westfall chat: "lfg VC vs DM debate"
---
 If you are finding it difficult just team up with someone. Many quests in Westfall are simple "kill x number of mobs quest". Quests like those are great to do in a party( chance to drop quest item per kill less so).
---
Tbh showing new players the ropes is one of the best things about playing the game again :)
---
DPS warriors won't be getting thunderfury first. DPS is restricted based on threat from the tank, you'll get more DPS by just not pulling aggro.
---
Nice free 2g 17s.

---
I'm not american, but I do hope Andrew Yang gets to be a candidate from democrats, he seems like a really good guy who knows what he's doing
---
So I started as dwarf but here is what my leveling looked like.
---
Dwarf starting area, karanos town in dun morogh, loch modan, elwynn forest then westfall. In that order.
---
I recommend you travel to karanos town in dun morogh.
---
Vanilla wow does not hand hold you through the leveling experience like you might expect any other game you buy to play single player story.
---
Very much open world figure it out type
---
Ok i am still a little confused, so lets double check..
---
There seems to be 2 different ways to go from gnomish to goblin (or goblin to gnomish)?
---
1- Drop engineering to start from the begining and take the other spec this time.
---
2- Or if you have money, go to tanaris, use the book, pay the gold and change your spec.
---
On my way.
---
That was a really unexpected reply. Bravo.
---
Its simple - get a party . You cant just simply solo 5 mobs at the same time.
---
Impressive, very nice.
---
Westfall is the hardest of the lvl 12-20 zones IMO. If you’re an 11 Rogue I could see it giving you problems.  Just tough it out, grind for another level or 2, or go hit Darkshore and come back around 14ish.
---
Technically, it's still an RP thing, but yeah.
---
Fun times--gift wrap a grey item and post it on the AH for 50s.  Hilarity ensues.
---
The joke is that the weapon isn’t worth getting, so the only value is has is vendor.
---
Big and strong, like bear!
---
What the other guy said is technically not true; end game with a Druid (off tanking a raid boss for instance) you will likely be going back there to get the mace for its massive consumable attack speed bonus if you are trying to push limits or what not.
---
The bow is meh, 1.7 AS is terrible
---
AAP went a bit haywire for me. It seemed to start autoaccepting quests that it didn't want, then getting confused. I've tried /aap reset and /aap skip and tried to get it to "catch up", but it still doesn't seem happy and sends me in obscure ways. Any advice here? I'd love for it to be able to reset, see what quests I have and haven't done, then suggest a new hub and restart it from there, but I think that is outside of its capabilities? It seems that if you stray from the suggested path at any point, it doesn't know how to handle it.
---
Is Ravager better than the Whirlwin axe?
---
About 10%
---
no there is only one way:
---
Drop engineering and relearn.
---
If you are (again) at 200+ go to tanaris and pick one specialization.
---
Switching specializations is not possible in classic.
---
Tell me why rend is awful?
---
Some people have had connectivity issues within the last 15 minutes.

World dragons drop a few BoP items, but mostly they drop BoEs. The value of a world dragon is selling the BoEs to fund your guild.
---
&gt; I think I read somewhere that server census’s show there’s a substantial age gap between alliance horde which might explain it.
---
Bitch we're all old now
---
Well you have bigger odds now if that is your dream. Feral dps are good especially if you willing to farm gr. You can also tank because a lot of raids would love to have you as ot tank and easier to gear two warriors and druid instead of extra warrior. If you dreaming of Mt that will still be hard because crushing from some bosses will sadly crush your dreams.
---
Blyatman lives.
---
Man you are petty
---
lol i thought this was a joke so googled it but holy crap that's actually insane, 10g is £30. So my mount would of cost me £270!
---
This was a running joke in my guild from warlords up to bfa
---
Yes I am aware. My point was mostly vs. Sulfuras’ actual usefulness, but thanks for pointing this out. Adds more info to my post.
---
Here's the thing. Many players don't enjoy the leveling experience so they want it to be over as quickly as possible. I am one of those people. For me I play for the PvP and the endgame content. Early dungeons are generally so easy that you faceroll them unless your group is horrible. And the level brackets for early dungeons makes them a bit weird because the early ones especially are easy to turn into a joke if most of you group is a few levels higher.  
---
I don't mind doing some quests here and there, but spending a month to hit 60 just to "savor" the leveling experience isn't at all enjoyable for me. If you like it then sure go ahead and take your time leveling. But just because that's the way you feel, doesn't mean other people have to play the game the same way as you. There's a lot of people worried that everyone is just blasting through the content thinking they will be done with the game quickly. Well, for me that's not the case at all. Even when I had a BiS mage (well, pre kt anyway) on a pserver. I would still queue up all day long just because i found pvp so fun.
---
The people that actually spend the gold on them?
---
I think its more sad that people play a race they might not enjoy because it has some minimal performance increase
---
Sup nogger
---
Step 1: learn defensive stance by completing lv10 warrior quest. Step 2: obtain 1-h and shield. Step 3: press k to see your weapon level. If your 1-h skill is low, you should train it on grey mobs. Step 4: learn bow/gun specialization and buy ammo. Step 5: find or form a group (I prefer forming the group as tank). 
---
Your rotation should be: use bow to pull from range-&gt;bloodthirst-&gt;shield block-&gt;revenge-&gt;sunder armor. This is a rotation I've seen from a guide. Personally prefer to sunder after bloodthirst and use block when im low health. Battle shout also helps you get single target aggro. Do not forget to enable target of target from options and taunt them if you are not the target of a mob
---
Those are alterac mountains quests you get them at your hilsbrad hub
---
lol no
---
Look up the command to remove spell security lock and it'll go back to normaol. 
---
Screw cancelaura macros lol
---
Maybe worried about a higher level alliance being caught up in it too, or maybe just wasn't thinking.
---
most mages i have met gives me free food without asking as a warrior. i have a ton of spirit i am undead so i will eat whatever we kill and i use bandages food is just not somthing i use very often.
---
Nutpete #1  - a fellow herod player
---
Yeah in some cases better. Feral du du is highest TPS in the game even beating dual wild tryhard. Higher tps means your dps can go balls to the wall making kills shorter and lowering overall clear times.
---
Theres a few fights were feral druid is not recommended. You gotta take in the new info man, times are a changing:p
---
No it’s not... not at 60
---
Glad I started my main character on that server when it was low/medium pop. Now I’ll never get to play her again...
---
Okay I should probably change the post to say "any advice that isn't just disagreeing with the concept like some jackass with nothing better to do". It's also 4 mobs, not surprising that the person replying with non answers can't even understand the question.
---
I tried multiple times over 3 days to try and get a group together for 'Insane Druids' in Ashenvale.   
---
It got to the point that people were telling me to shut up. Like i can't do it by myself, the mob density is to high. Welp anyway on the third day after about 40min of asking for help in /1 i decide to do it myself.  
---
I get there and there is 3 people getting ready to enter the place. I ask if they are doing insane druids. Ignored. I ask if we can do it together. ignored. I tried striking up a friendly convo, nothing. Then i just straight up asked "Hey are you guys ignoring me?" and one of them replied "Yea lul"  
---
Apparently they found my asking for help in /1 'annoying' and not inviting me to their group to do the quest was my ironic punishment. It wasn't like i was spamming it in chat. or being obnoxious. Literally just saying "LFG Insane Druids" once ever 5min or so while i was doing other things in the zone.  
---
I waited for them to clear mobs, then i would tag quest mob and kill it, they would also kill it. Then they would clear the way to the next druid, repeat. I got all 3 quest mobs in the dungeon, they walked around with me the whole time as if in the same party. They didn't realize that none of them had completed the quest or gotten credit for any of the 3 druids till i pointed it out about 20min later when we were all leaving the place.  
---
I said 'ty' in /s and one of them laughed at me telling me 'GG'. Then i was like "I completed the quest". After a moment of silence they realised they just spent the last 20min being my bitch and have to do it all over again. They had spent more time and effort on trying to grief me than just playing the game and it backfired.  
---
This of course was my fault and IM the asshole in this situation. yea ok bro.
---
Sums it up pretty well, my wife doesn’t game but has learned to accept it like your husband has.
---
I should save this post because it just sums everything up perfectly..
---
Classicwow.live has been great so far when i just want a path to follow
---
Oh my word. I’m going to gift wrap *everything* now. Every day will be like Christmas.
---
Alchemy will be worth it once you can transmute arcanite or convert Essences. Elixirs are also valuable. Raw materials will usually sell better than completed goods, because people don't really buy healing and mana potions while levelling, so you're only going to sell end-game goods. People will buy your herbs to level their own alchemy.
---
It’s been discussed for so long that I think you should just google it. There’s a player called Skarm who has in-depth druid tanking guides on youtube, check it out.
---
Its faster than that. You can still recieve mail. Made care package for my brother but he was still flagged as starter. But mailing him bags and few silver worked just fine
---
fuck that's actually nuts. I feel like I remember when 100g was like $15
---
Kinda funny considering the amount of downtime they have drinking compared to almost every other class.
---
So unless you ar pulling +6 mobs every pull, it will generally go slower.
---
Go to loch Modan come back at 14
---
As if he didn’t want exactly that to happen

It was pretty foolish of us to try taking it on, but it was a memorable fight :-)

Math. It’s not additive probability.
---
wooosh?
---
It’s what they level as.
---
So yes, you’ll most likely be Retribution if you decide to get this hammer.
---
Thanks for all your hard work!
---
15 years ago when I could nolife the game, playing without addons was doable (also I didnt really know they were a thing until later levels)
---
But now, with my MAYBE 90 minutes a night to play, Questie has been a godsend.

God I fucking hate barrens
---
Most of the time you’re there for the xp, but sometimes you just want ‘the experience’.
---
Bullfight is a goody. Or Heffa
---
AAP works best when used from the beginning, I started later on and sometimes it'll tell me to take a quest but I don't have the required level. It's not perfect but I just leveled up a bit by myself and then followed what it said after a reset and it was fine again.
---
Insane, got adds for some site that charged €400 for 100g on firemaw. Insane

Update your video drivers, if your GPU driver is crashing and recovering it means it's something with the drivers, update them and if it keeps happening than you might have a more serious problem.

GZ! I’m also on Flamelash and was wondering when will the Server First be. :)
---
When will they be implemented ?
---
Someone give this man some gold
---
Thank god theres a quest that lets me enjoy the game instead of wasting an hour of my MAYBE 90 minutes of game time a night looking for spawn locations.
---
Oh! Hey Trusty! I remember you, you're a night elf druid on Waterlords, right? We played Deadmines yesterday, I was Oisvu, the night elf rogue.
---
Fancy meeting you here, and seeing that we even share the country :D
---
It's going to depend on your class, the specific grind, how many other people are trying to grind the same mobs - if applicable, how efficient your route is, how geared you are, etc.
---
Never said you did, just a fun little comparison
---
pandas confirmed for classic
---
From what I remember of vanilla rogue, it's not that you necessarily want a dagger in the offhand, it's that you want a fast offhand for poison application and daggers tend to be faster.
---
It's everyone blowing up layer hopping abuse that's making it become more and more popular... I didn't know about it till I read the rants. Now I do it 2 times an hour in contested zones.... It's so much fun to rotate who you are yanking in stv
---
can’t find the bluepost, but you have [this](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/news/blizzard-talks-about-spell-batching-in-wow-classic/).
---
Sweet, one silver.
---
Auctioneer
---
It's 2 weeks in obv, so it'll settle especially once they get into Marau farming and DM:E comes out but RN an account nearly a mirror of mine is for sale for £500.
---
Paladin only  &gt;\_&lt;
---
Druids can learn to use 2H Hammers, would be great for them as well with those stats.
---
Haha, Amen to that.
---
You want to fight a mob(monster or beast) that has 4 enemeys and one is also higher level. From what i red i understood that you want to take out a group of 5 . Now i see you mean a mob like a mob of people. In that case only option is to sap one, blind other and quickly kill the main target highest lvl mob using evasion asap so it comes off cd faster
---
Your instant attacks will deal more damage
---
It was for achievements haha I was resto even XD
---
Not in this part of vanilla? Ty they changed it later in vanilla
---
You report to sentinel hill but the quests should be started in the north.
---
The key to westfall is learned in the hogger area - assume everything will get aggro'ed.
---
The area also encourages you to group with people as you are working towards deadmines.
---
-cheers
---
THERE ARE SECONDARY SKILLS!?
---
This time I tried leveling with disc/holy spec in a spellcleave group. I got 4 days played and had quite fun. If dungeon leveling wasn't meta I would have picked shadow
---
Don't think meeting stones summoned until wrath.
---
IMO -
---
This addon is gamebreaking for BGs and should be bannable. Rogues already have it tough and people having an addon for something that should be reported by everyone is like having flag-visuals on the map for wsg. Should count as cheating and be a bannable addon
---
thats not a combo, youre breaking the combo to cc another mob.
---
I know that feel. I was just farming some water elementals and bam a Wardens Staff
---
Unfortunately regardless of the item and rarity, it's only worth what people will be willing to pay. Post in Trade Chat 'selling Mooncloth bag, PST offer.' and average out your reasonable offers. Also base it off the next lowest tier bag average price. For example, I got a Large Knapsack and (on my server/economy) it sold for nearly 2g. Mooncloth is 2 tiers higher. You can also be tyrannical and just control the Mooncloth Bag economy however you'd like, but they may not sell. Also, they may not sell in general unless your server has a lot of endgame toons.
---
time travel : man in black 3
---
Go back to retail lol
---
Another fun one for that spot is night elf priest. Sit there shadowmelded and mind control people off the lift.
---
That only happened in the pre tbc patch because of horde getting paladins and alliance getting shamans.
---
We need to tone this kindness down a bit. Everyone is expecting free healthstones
---
This shows how awkward it is as alliance around 30, not really much to do in thousand needles and arathi, desolace and STV doesnt really kick off until 33+.
---
Ain’t that the fucking truth.
---
I had and played with corrupted ashbringer on a pserver and the stam loss was too much so I went back to using Ashkandi in PvP. The difference between +33 stam and -25 stam is a whopping 580 HP
---
I made a Gnome warlock and all I can think is how shit it's going to look in the tier sets :'(
---
Implying Sulfuras on shaman is more useful than on Paladin. lol
---
I think I get what you're saying, they're both "polite" white lies where you pretend like you wanted to say yes to an inconvenience.
---
In this context it wouldn't make sense to say it tho, if there is room then the guy literally loses nothing from saying yes to OP. If it was one of those quests where you have to share the loot, then it would be likely.
---
Interesting idea. How did they force it? Or would that be cheating technically?
---
Shit I just rememberd I had an auto dismount addon back in the day!
---
Hope someone comes up with a new one!
---
The first character that I leveled in Classic 15 years ago was a rogue and I know exactly the feeling.
---
It's quite exciting actually to get in some many places trying not be detected by the mobs and only kill the last mob using all your cooldowns.
---
Wtf is happening. I get in for like 5 mins and DC again? Servers are cooked mate.
---
The sarcasm really was not clearly emphasised.
---
They have been a shitshow to be fair.
---
Constant DCs since launch, layer bugs
---
Really sucks they got Aldi Mobile to host these servers.
---
Just oceanic things.
---
&gt;  great DPS spec
---
&gt; going paladin
---
Pick one
---
There are tons of people on earth that have wanted to delete their IRL character at some point in their life and there’s tons and tons of people that didn’t go through with it and are in much better places now. Nothing lasts forever and life can change drastically for the better. It may seem like it never will change, but it totally can. 
---
Congrats to you man, I can’t imagine the kind of strength it takes to stick around when you don’t really feel like it.
---
Love it that you can actually build up a reputation on your server thats amazing
---
Grid2, now I remember, merci
---
If we ignore resist mechanism:
---
P(not\_stun\_first\_tick) = (0.74)\^4 \~= 0.3
---
P(not\_stun\_second\_tick) = (0.74)\^8 \~= 0.09
---
So, only ten percent of the mobs shouldn't be stuned after 2 seconds.
---
You must’ve been really hurt by his reply if just taking the quest wasn’t enough for you. So pathetic.
---
Imo if someone talks to you rudely and you reply the same way (or even worse), you’re not any better. So I don’t have sympathy nor do I support neither of you two, you’re worth each other.
---
It sucks because at some point your raid becomes so geared thunderfury is pretty much required to hold threat and if your guild doesn't get it dps start to leave. Nobody wants to be waiting for 3 sunder when they're fully decked out in bwl bis. Some guilds will have multiple tf and some guilds will have none. Really stinks to have such an integral part of your raid decided by rng.
---
Where is "Fade"?
---
Where did I ever say that?
---
Horse is the best race in classic
---
Ah I understand so much!
---
My guild as a discord, I don’t want to join right now, cause I’m to scared they treat me differently once they find out I’m a girl....
---
Atm I’m having so much fun talking and doing dungeons with them. 
---
but even the kindest and coolest peoples I met on wow could change a lot the way they acted with me once they knew I was a girl. (Not in a mean way, but just being treated differently than other could be a bit sad)
---
I don’t know man, I’m pretty stoked for the weapons I get in retail every time a BIS form a raid or dungeon drops. Plus, my DKs Herald of Pestilence looks dope AF, seriously it’s awesome! When I finally unlocked that, I couldn’t have been happier with a weapon in the game! In any caseI think on one hand, it feels nice to get a weapon that is with a crap, retail or classic.  On the other hand,  not having to carry an 8-bit hammer for a weapon is nice.
---
Get gud horde trash
---
Haha..I'll stick with priest since shadow seems amazing in PvP.
---
Totally. In vanilla, my guild MT was a druid and crushed it.
---
Yep had this issue when I restarted on a fresh acc in wod, had everything setup and wanted to startt with the boost ...
---
So then i basically could only lvl a useless char for a while until it let me use my boost..
---
The bfa story doesn’t interest me at all
---
honestly if you are massivly undergeard like say the first time you go in for onyxia and MC a week and half into the classic they are likly the better tank.
---
warriors need gear but once they get gear hooo boy are they monsters.
---
It’s a joke man chill...
---
sometimes i'd be happy about this, rather than waiting 10min for respawn
---
Dem Defias Pillagers, man...
---
https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw
---
You are completely right, but this is classic.
---
Cos it's an rpg. A quest and an item designed to make you feel like a paladin.
---
Not item level xxx no. xx
---
That would be Agamaggan's crotch.
---
What level should I be as hunter before attempting this? Sounds like a nice peaceful way to grind at my own pace
---
Man, the salt is real in this thread.
---
Actually you are completely wrong here :) Layering doesn't increase any server capacity. Also the purpose of layering is something completely different. The purpose of layering is to make sure there aren't too many people in the same area which helps both for questing and for server performance. Each layer houses a copy (instance) of the entire game world but it does NOT have he capacity of a full server. 
---
Otherwise if what you are saying would be true, a server that has a 10k queue now and have 8 layers, if they would remove 8 layers that would mean there is a queue of like 80k people which obviously isn't true.
---
Blizzard has explained how layer works in quite a few blue posts in the forum and increasing the server capacity is not the purpose of layering and not what layering does.
---
This is the correct advice.
---
Truly.
---
I’ve been discouraged from playing as a healer early on though, I would love to heal, but it’s not viable solo is it?
---
great so you're also too stupid to understand what empathy means.
---
Got it at lvl 27, still feels great despite the fact it only gave me like a 1.2 dps increase
---
&gt; several fights through out vanilla
---
Could you name it?
---
Because playing ret is literally choosing the best pvp healer class, and then ignoring the best parts about it to go auto attack instead. And let your dps die without healing. Go a pure dps class if you want to dps. You can still go ret if you know what you're doing in pvp, I just don't thiink the alliance need more rets that don't heal, use freedom on others (cleanse yourself lol), use bop on mages in team fights etc, etc.
---
the idea back in the day was to time your tremor totem drop so that after it is apply mere milisecounds later the entire group has the fear removed. infact that was the tactic for crazy cat lady boss in ulduar aswell.
---
me personally i just prefer going on undead and removing the fear with will of the forsaken.
---
No, not really.
---
How do you get the ignots??
---
Sadly ret IIRC is among the worst dps spec period in classic. Unless they do a balancing pass that wont change until TBC if they do it.
---
Open a ticket
---
Random but has the mage one been done and is there a link to it if so?
---
Even though the meme is accurate, you can't really level a warrior and using exclusively 1 type of weapon. You need to constantly use different types so as something like this rarely happens
---
I'd have gotten a much.......much......different letter
---
Am mage can confirm this. Gotten bad tanks that say "fast runs aoe pulls" then proceed to pull no more than 3 things and I'm like wtf do you want me to do here.
---
The feeling is mutual. I’ve tried to help horde too many times and been punished for it every time.
---
You realize your statement can be said about any class / spec combo?
---
If it ever doesn’t work out for you and you need a husband who gets it hit me up.
---
I've heard it doesn't scale endgame, it's only good for leveling
---
Golemag with ~20% drop rate.
---
Down at the bottom of the battle.net client should be a menu, says “World of Warcraft”. You should be able to click the menu and Classic should show up separately, that’s all you’ll need to install
---
The worst thing is when you miss overpower.
---
You are such an asshole lol nice.
---
I did from 150-205(my current cap at 41) yesterday anger fortress. Was nice, i couldn't deal with the magna elite tho that blocked some of the boxes. But took about an hour, pickpocket all dwarfs and killed what i had to.
---
Made like 10 gold from greens, and got blind powder from the boxes from pickpocket.
---
Super werf it, i haven't used lockpicking and pickpocket in years :D
---
Dumb answer.  Most of the grindy bottleneck quests are not the ones where you're killing 5 of this and 10 of that.  They're the ones where you need 12 bear asses at a 10% drop rate.  And grouping up does absolutely nothing to help with that, and will only hurt you if you're above average at tagging stuff.
---
Paying almost $40 for Joanna’s, IMO, is not anywhere near worth it. I’m sure there are some nuances to the guide that make it slight superior but there’s tons for free shit that’ll get you there in a similar amount of time.
---
Informant does that, but it doesn't seem to work for Classic. If anyone else knows an alternative, please let us know!
---
&gt; Uh, quit the moral play. 
---
Some people have morals.
---
&gt; If you want to pull that bs, then it is by far better to kick one person and invite someone else for the greater good of 5 people. 
---
It is not about 'greater good', and you know it. It is all about you and your ass.
---
I never said that im leaving and i don't plan on leaving any time soon.
---
eh, never been big into the pvp side of WoW! i main characters on both sides. from a lore side the horde fuckin sucks lmao
---
lol, sounds like my Guild chat hahaha
---
Aye me (priest) and my warrior friend make groups with people who wont need on gear we want because we can pick any 3 dos we want.
---
Epic mounts took months. Unless you were good at gaming the ah.
---
The game is not complete because only 2 raids are live.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBbQg8r8tdc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBbQg8r8tdc)
---
What action bar add-on is that?
---
I found a working copy on curse - you need to check under the issues tab, and open "does not work with....classic"
---
someone has fixed it to work - start by downloading the main code, then the code he's attached to his comment.
---
It works on both my warlock and priest, but not on my druid which is a damned shame coz that is my main
---
cheers  
---
Phil
---
I was able to kill that Magna Elite and he had shitty drop... there are 3 possible box spawns next to him so its worth to kill him for that
---
It’s an awesome grind for bis pieces, professions, wpvp, making gold (you want to prioritise this now cause phase 2 onwards gold farming gets a lot harder). I spent a bit of time in BRD tanking on my 59 hunter with lower guildies helping them get their quests and chilling, the people make the content rather than the content forcing you to play the game.
---
Demo Shout has an animation, I've seen he spamming it. Also he is in my guild and he told me. Esfand and others also use this method to aggro big packs.
---
do officers get first dibs on raid loot or something? Or is that only for quest chain legendaries like this?
---
Found No-Ho Hank
---
Thats partly what brought these questions up for me, with the "0 changes" idea, creating anything new would be Blizz just shooting themselves in the foot. And just moving onto BC would pretty much be kicking the bucket down the road.  
---
Thanks for the response!
---
This. They didn't became the norm until roughly 1 year after release. It'll be quicker now, but not for everyone.
---
Sure
---
I just hit 39 , any good place to farm mobs for gold so I can purchase my mount ?
---
Actually yes
---
Which server? Not asking for a friend.
---
What other addons are you using? I like the setup you have!
---
I was waiting for an escort Solo. I see it spawn and I see another guy start running for it too. We were both in the area obviously waiting. I’m solo and he had a non full group. I grabbed the escort before him. He got mad at me saying I should’ve grouped and we could’ve done it together. Mother fucker you want me to invite you’re entire group? You’re the one mad dashing for it so I’m going to fight for it! 
---
I gave him a “lol don’t act like you weren’t running for it”
---
It's the GW2 Ui included one :)
---
Bloody hell alright Janos Slynt 😂
---
I don't think you've read the post.
---
Rogue on December 4th 2004 iirc
---
Just for the record there was very little layer abuse. Blizzard made a blue post clarifying that they have all the data regarding it and very few people jump between layers at all
---
With gear matching the tier or below ?
---
Good talk.
---
In classic, as a druid that is leveling solo, you won’t really play as &lt;insert style here&gt;.  Druid is best when you use it all.  Your talent build is up to you, because all of the skills and spells are still there.  During a solo fight, you open with balance (damage and roots and more damage), then maybe a heal over time on yourself, and then bear form to burn them down, with more healing after the fight.  That sequence will let you easily handle three mobs, and if you “git gud”, you can handle five and sometimes more.
---
Druid is mediocre at everything, but when you put everything together, druid is far greater than the sum of its parts.
---
In dungeons (not solo), I’m specced feral, and I’ve been tanking, healing, and last night ran as cat dps.  That was the most fun, because I saved a couple of wipes, once by becoming the bear and off tanking some unexpected adds, and twice by simply throwing some extra heals to let the priest catch back up.  Utility.  Support.  Druid brings everything to the table.
---
Shut up, the whole “you can only play how i want you to play” part of this community is so fucking annoying, just stfu already
---
I'm actually going to have to start doing this xD
---
Herp
---
yeah that's what I figured! At 60 or so I'll probably switch to healing, thank you!
---
&gt;This is the same crowd that on server after server insisted that Rag is so hard he can not be killed without 40 man BiS groups with 3 world buffs, because any other way it just wouldn't be optimal and thus not worth considering.
---
No... Its the crowd that regularly killed him with 30 man raids and not even all of them being lvl 60 lol
---
Hah same thoughts.
---
I think your caps lock key is broken
---
Yea - I basically just want an option to go DPS in PvP and it seems like priest offers that where paladin you are stuck in Holy unless you are completely geared out.
---
I like a 'door to the future' kind of solution, where cWoW is preserved in a 0 changes state, and you have the option of migrating into the future, going to TBC and so on. Obviously, this isn't as simple as that. There are server issues, hosting, keeping contamination out, splitting the playerbase concerns, etc etc
---
People who are stressing over playing BFA:Classic are thinking 15 years down the line, idk, I'll be 40 at that point prob have my first heart attack around 28 with the energy drinks I've been slamming for Classic. No fear, won't be here.
---
By a considerable margin on top of the added benefit of not being melee.
---
Don't rush to 60.  Enjoy the old world.
---
In fuckin party chat he says that?!?
---
Kick the fucker, get a mage that's not a dildo.
---
I always tell myself people like this are trolling but i think a decent chunk of them are actually just stupid.
---
yes i read about the charges. Apparently people used to collect them, like farm sets of them and after using the charges. Im down to do that they are not even bad as stat sticks.
---
TYVM
---
&gt;then u need a big amount of warlocks
---
If a shadow priest does 30% of the dps of a warlock then you just need 5 warlocks in a raid to make a shadow priest an overall buff. They're way more than 30%, and most roads will have 4 or 5ish warlocks, so they're good to have.
---
Uninstall yall
---
I'd rather not invest time trying to convince someone who already isn't sure if they want to stick around. You either want to or don't, and it's clear you've made your mind up. Unsub and take your support group begging shit elsewhere.
---
Got one as a mage in Vanilla and.......equipped 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
darkshore has been really nice every time ive been there in classic (leveled two chars 10-20 through it), I think because all the new earnest players are rolling nelves. Meanwhile loch modan general chat it talking about "dark iron" dwarf crime statistics
---
Yeah, got nothing like that :(
---
That's so funny.  Honestly, I love how much harder vanilla is.  I played in tbc so I've never really played vanilla.  Cheers!
---
I used to think Demon Skin was an angry bulldog face
---
Hybrid disc + shadow until 40.  Respec shadow at 40 with shadow form.  Respec again at 60 (or near) to your desired role.  This is with the assumption you are doing a combination of questing and dungeons until 60.  You can absolutely heal dungeons as shadow or shadow/disc.  If you want to raid, you’ll want to choose a holy or disc spec (depending on your objectives) once you cap.
---
Won't be completely dead but I imagine server populations will settle down significantly, ideally it ends up as one PvP, one PvE, and one RP server per region.
---
It certainly has value, but not in getting rich.
---
I had a 300 enchanter on classic, and spent literally days farming 300 the rare crusader enchant. I might have made 10G in tips from what I ever sold in total.
---
The most common excuse is:
---
bUt Im HeRe FoR tEh Xp
---
🤦‍♂️
---
I particularly like that the title is *when* and not *if*
---
It was fun while it lasted... thanks for a week of memories !!
---
Shitheads are few and far between in my experience (Dreadmist EU), but they are around.
---
There was this mage, we were both killing Furlborgs in Ashenvale and he kept tagging everything instead of just sharing fairly (he wasn't AoE farming.)   
---
I whispered him and told him there's more than enough here for everyone and don't be a douche. No reply.
---
I see him later in the caves, I've teamed up with a priest who invited me. He proceeds to start the escort quest, alone, even though we were killing the last mobs in that room to do it ourselves.
---
I keep my mouth shut, no point telling him off. After Ruul respawns and we do it, I go too far away from Ruul (scouting ahead for alliance) and I fail the quest. The priest insists we go back so I can complete. The mage is back, he apparently failed and now he wants to team up.   
---
We agree, he starts the quest immediately while mine was still failed in my log. Another escort, I get no credit. I tell him and he actually apologises. I say it's fine and we help him with the quest.
---
At the end he is so thankful. I hope we turned someone from the dark side that day. He went from douche to apologising (for not really doing anything wrong), being thankful, and offering us Shredder pages.
---
That was a good day.   
---
Never did get to finish the escort though...
---
It’s really just eating once a day, unless I’m misreading. But I think he’s saying he eats every 24 hours. I do the same thing, and it’s actually awesome. I do keto as well, so I basically eat 2000 calories of mostly fat and protein for dinner every night. It’s like a daily epic feast. And I’m healthier than ever.
---
Food pyramid lied!!
---
That sucks. I actually had to stop playing my Warlock at peak hours because I was a snacc to all horde on Grobb. I can’t even quest in STV. So now I’m levelling a huntard and plan on destroying everyone who gets in my way
---
My friend's uncle got this on his warlock back in the day. He didn't realize how much it sold for and equipped it &gt;.&lt;
---
I thought it was hilarious 
---
I’m apparently the doppelgänger of the nanny as well
---
In retail, yes. But in Classic, Certificate of Ownership doesn't exist yet and you can never rename your pet if you happen to realize you don't like its name anymore.
---
it’s only elvui and details for my damage meter that’s hiding under the bag i panic opened when running from mograine! elvui is extremely customizable and my setup only scratches the surface of what you can do with it. been using it on retail for years and was glad it got ported to classic
---
A true saint
---
You buy cat 50 MSK? 2 cats 75 MSK. Cats very nice quality.
---
That’s because it is. You can even find lore about pandarens in The Swamp of Sorrows I believe. You can find Chen Stormstouts brew or something iirc
---
That makes me feel much better! Thank you! A mix of everything would be for the best.
---
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
---
lol wtf why would you sell it *now*?  
---
That item becomes insanely valuable when twinks kick off
---
Maybe they took two weeks off work and did something they truly enjoy? What do you even know about their lifes.
---
Wtf is this a screen recording of a tweet? Have we ascended? I think we can only top this with a camera recording of a tweet...
---
Had an alliance priest try to do the same thing to me.. a quick counterspell and then he became a sheep for the rest of the boat trip.
---
Hunters arw in such a terrible state right now that a lit of people hae legit rerolled. They're only pvp utility is pre-combat traps and pet dmg. Scatter and trap DR is still a thing from what it looks like so we can't even use scatter and traps on the same target in 1v1s
---
That's my plan.  Honestly they could have reshrunk the server caps that they expanded a week ago to make queue go back to 20k+ to assist people to change there mind and move.  But they didn't so I'll suck it up and go reroll on Whitemane, the queu was only a few thousand anyway.
---
Increased server capacity and people aren’t all jumping to get on right at the same time
---
Kargoz is good 
---
If you follow anything Tips says , you should uninstall
---
This is why I play druid. Then I can both decline the invite and solo the elite.
---
My bank (gnome ofc) is Morganstanly
---
Same things you do in retail, farm for those bis pieces roll an alt, game the ah, kill other faction. Literally the end game is the same cause the game never really changed.
---
zul farrak was always crazy fast respawn.
---
I'm usually not a grammar nazi either, but it took me about a minute to figure out what this person was talking about with that mistake. That's why I said something this time.
---
Hmmm... hopefully they get this fixed quickly.
---
after switching debugging on I discovered it wasn't working on my druid because I was testing against mobs that were too low a level.
---
doh! Works perfectly

Come back in 12 hours.

Idk if you'll get to this but i swear theres a memory leak somewhere in the addon. I had to uninstall it because opening my map was basically disconnecting me. If i opened it while running with a group id end up 10 yards behind them while my game froze to open the map.

If it gets too annoying you can politely tell him that warlocks are indeed able to drink like any other class.
---
Warlock taps, healer goes oom, healer drinks, warlock stands around afk
---
Taking cell phone pictures of screens really is an epidemic. Why?
---
Which is why I love playing war. The socialisation aspect.

I like that you’re pretending like some vanilla expert but don’t even know Greater Blessings exist.
---
I've been on the latest drivers for a while now. The weird thing is, it seems to just happen when playing WoW Classic on ultra graphic settings
---
Yea you can literally see Sony in the middle behind everyone.
---
Then I dont have to close the game or disrupt anything.
---
The design philosophy is so vastly different between classic and TBC gear; the old stuff prioritizes readability at a glance. Does this read as cloth or plate? Can you still kinda tell the design from further away?
---
Somewhere during wotlk and cata they begun really caking on all that sguiggly texture which can often blur together when viewed from afar, and the difference between armour types isn't so visually clear cut.

Both have their appeal as well as pros and cons.

What does that have to do with him waiting for internet and/or using his phone as a hotspot while he waits?

Guild drama amirite?

Let me know how that works out for you.
---
I had a similar issue and putting FPS cap to unlimited fixed it for me
---
The way Mankirk was shot with the week-day-hour format was pretty cool.
---
It's not as good as duelwield but if you are wearing a fucking sulfuras hammer it's certainly better than dalrends...
---
Yup that's the way to do it
---
LFM SM Arm/Cath Cleave dps only! That's all I ever see. I legit went back and respected my paladin to Holy just so I could hope to get a group
---
Try to log in in Venoxis between 2 and 8pm ^^ u will be suprised
---
Ah yes, who didn't get lost for hours in UC the first time there... Still can't navigate it after 10 years of playing
---
I like Joana
---
I thought the same thing at first but its wrong, to understand why you just have to ask "what does each player get from this item".
---
A BOP epic staff drops - for a mage it gives 50 gold worth of stats, for a warrior it gives 1 gold from vendoring
---
A BOE epic staff drops - for a mage it gives 50 gold worth of stats, for a warrior it gives 50 gold worth of stats from selling it and buying an epic shield.
---
I want to assure you this will not be your only experience (unless your on a totally crappy server).  I’ve been in four or five runs so far, and only one bad one.  The others have been a glorious return to the old style of dungeon running, with strategy, CC, and just plain fun.  Rolling for chests, taking turns on mining and skinning, people asking permission to need for off-specs, etc.
---
And most importantly, laughing about wipes, or cheering on that player that makes that clutch move that saves the wipe.
---
How is sulfuras better on shaman than on paladin? It blows on both, at least ret dps is actually played by a few idiots, enhancement shaman is a joke, and elemental is better in pvp too.
---
If you can’t manage to play a game which isn’t the most popular thing around then Classic was never going to be for you.
---
We all knew population would drop and most of us could not give a single shit about twitch numbers.
---
Never played WoW in any shape or form, don’t know anyone who plays classic so going in alone. Thinking of going hunter or roque, any tips / recommendations or possibly other good classes that would work well for me / my skill level ?
---
to complete the answer: Go to the class trainer
---
Vuhdo seems to be working out very nicely u have been using that instead of heal bot it's very similar you should check it out :)
---
My 2015 MBP with Iris 6100 runs it on setting 2 really smooth.
---
You said yourself that it feels complete already, and you're saying that Classic is basically pigeon-holed due to no indication of natural progress because we already know that expansion content exists in retail. You want a retail-version of Classic. This is not what Classic is for. We want to relive the original experience, without expectation of any major new content.
---
You don't even give out full stacks to party members? Lol
---
So, does that mean that Horde in classic are the same as everyone in retail? each-to-its-own-and-fuck-everyone ? and Allies are being more social nice and friendly to each other ?

I m gonna try that for real lol...
---
Imagine being a furry
---
yes they do, on all cleave fights and trash.
---
It’s the worst in looking for group
---
When I run from mobs and don't want to get dazed, I always jump and turn to the mob when I'm mid air, then turn back when I'm about to land. Does this actually work or am I looking like an idiot for nothing?
---
Anything can be banned
---
In late 2008 I had a druid named Ubuntu, and someone reported me and blizzard made me change my name because it was a trademark, even tho they (Ubuntu) wouldn't probably care
---
&gt;certain faction of the forsaken who were clearly evil - the royal apothecary society and varimathras.
---
That "certain faction" happens to be led and governed by the leaders of the Forsaken. Their actions are directed by them. 
---
Literally every new UD players has to perform quests to develop a new plague able to wipe every living being from Azeroth during their start.
---
Stop trying to pretend the Forsaken are okay when they clearly are evil.
---
If you're having the time of your life in a video game, wait until you travel the world, it's amazing. 
---
Sincerely,
---
A millenial.
---
It works decently in lower dungeons but gets less and less effective as you level up in my experience.
---
Not the above poster, but Nefarion comes to mind.
---
Charging for water in a group? No.
---
Charging for ports? Yes.
---
So as a counter PSA: Dont be that mage that gives away free ports unless its to exit an instance. The rest of us need that money
---
He was with me during vanilla, he will be with me during classic.
---
Play what you want to play. 
---
Rag was killed with -30 people some of which weren’t even level 60. Despite what you think optimal raid comps will hardly matter unless you are trying to compete for a top guild game wide.
---
Dude's a horrible parent but if I had a kid like that I'd give the fuck up on them too, no joke.
---
Some hobbies can, if you’re good at them. Definitely cuts the list down though.
---
Its a paladin Quest...
---
Lol.
---
Are target dummies a thing in classic?  I'm presuming not, otherwise folks would practice on them.
---
There's more to threat than just damage. Each class has a threat modifier, some skills, defensive stance is a multiplier, buffs create threat, etc. A small amount of something on a tank can become a large amount of threat generated. 
---
Also tanks tend to do a good amount of damage vs actual DPS until the DPS get real gear. I remember warriors who would be top of the damage meters all the time in BC and WotLK when everyone was still leveling/gearing. But eventually it would change and they'd be in the bottom.
---
To pull a mob off someone in melee you need to surpass 110% threat. Ranged is like 130%. Some classes have modifiers that reduce threat generation or can drop it altogether. 
---
Here's a video to help you out with info. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOGCaOhCZvo It's just a slide show so you don't have to actually watch it.
---
pretty standard for me tbh
---
Why doesnt retail have weather?

I think the SPriest was going allong with the cat&amp;mouse games for the lulz. No way he is this clueless.
---
Swiss and off shore? Don't think that's possible lol the Swiss own no islands lol
---
Waiting for you to clear a path is pretty bad, but hanging out AT a node you're already at, and waiting for your loot animation to start to finish so they can hit it when you're physically incapable of stopping them isnt just bad, it's bullshit. 
---
The mentality of "you don't own nodes" isn't really any better than "you don't own dungeon chests, so the Hunter just walking up to it while everyone else is fighting and taking it is fine. They're fair game." Except in THAT scenario, you can at least kick them, and they'll be removed from the dungeon. There's no fallback to ninjaing a hit on nodes, especially if they're just following you around a zone.
---
But I would say that you should play the race you like best:) keep in mind it’s only 10% more. Meaning....if you don’t think too much about it I am sure you will not notice it
---
Lol omg you’re taking it sooo easy!!! xDD

Fury Warrior for PvE, dual wield or two handed?
---
Its the fear of investing their time into playing a game that is not FotM. Enjoyment and fun is not something they value in a game, they like those instagram models who desperately want to become famous.
---
Nice Belt too.
---
I am sorry to hear that. I have heard multiple people talk about how they feel like WoW saved their lives. For many I would say it gave them lives more than saved it. Gives you a community, friends, interactions with real people, funny experiences and hard experiences. I totally agree with someone else who posted. Right now if gaming is helping you then that is nothing to be ashamed of. I hope you find what you’re looking for IRL as well though and things get better for you.

Warriors are often said to be the hardest class to level, that's probably why:D

I been watching Twitch client for WOW Classic addons that bring functionality. I will be installing HandyNotes\_NPC and resetting my Handynotes.LUA .
---
Just because you beat the last boss in a raid doesn’t mean you got the fear you need. Guilds will do raids multiple times to complete sets that will make the next tier easier
---
Was wondering am i losing my mind or what.
---
That trinket is so good.
---
Back in vanilla my first ever AV kill at lvl 52(mage) was the top main tank of the server. I didn't know he was literally the most geared warrior on the server AND wielding Sulfuras. I killed him without him landing a single blow on me and everyone lost their shit. I didn't know back then but now I do; this was no feat, this guy was a PvE scrub.
---
As a warrior I think I died at least 20 times in westfall just going from 10-14.  I eventually bailed and went to Loch Modan so I could do all the level 10ish quests in that zone.  Its rough out there
---
What server?
---
Dude, welcome. I fucked with it for hours. Drove me insane!
---
If we can figure out another way to produce the issue consistently after a /reload, that would narrow down the potential sources a lot
---
Thanks for helping debug this, I appreciate it
---
Hunter is beginner friendly. Frost mage is a really strong leveling class, but for levels 1-20 you're gonna sit down and drink between each mob.
---
It's built into us, gotta be robots to overcome that
---
As a warrior, I have to eat/bandage after most pulls. Having mage food saves me serious gold. 4 stacks of level 35 food are about 1.5g. I will happily pay 10-40s for some stacks of mage food.

Holy crap I had no idea.. I'm going to do that right now
---
Three things.
---
1.) farmers in vanilla could net 5 lotus an hour, same as the one streamer, if they knew how and where to go. 
---
2.) Did you consider the elevated demand?  If lotus and devilsaur are on timers but don't respawn faster when there are more people, the price will be absurdly high.
---
3.) Each day brings more 60s who are hungry to farm.  No one is going to be able to farm any rare material infinitely.
---
You failed to grasp one concept; if this is bad, why is Blizzard allowing it?  If you think Blizzard realizes this is bad, why do nothing and lie to cover it up?  Your logic rests on the concept that Blizzard wants wow classic to fail.
---
So sad, delete your character and run for her

It was so out of the blue.

Just like the UK is gonna be, it seems.

So the Alliance Scum can gank him? No dice he is stashed away in the Gadgetzstan
---
Melee leeway
---
Ok I’m changing my answer: Because I am old.
---
Don’t forget to keybind them also.  I typically do them with shift / alt / cntrl modifiers, but do use other keys as well.
---
Meh all part of the game. Clever use of mechanics. Also layer hopping has no real bearing on the discussion at hand, which is whether it matters to min max your race selection.
---
Small world
---
Maybe, but the Barrens is like a gajillion times bigger than Duskwood and people stay to level there for fucking ages.
---
Which is kinda awesome, if you ask me.
---
I did the exact same thing in hillsbrad for the Perenold kill quest. A lower lvl alliance must have been doing his equivalent for a named orc in the same house. We /waved and pointed to the npcs we wanted before helping eachother clear the area. Good to see even on a pvp realm you can harbour friendships cross factions.
---
I'm pretty sure you can configure BadBoy to do that.
---

The best part of playing a hunter or mage is farming the crap out of mobs in a given area and no one else can keep up or even stop you. I know one of these classes is around when I go to an area and everything is dead with no groups in sight. Fuck that guy, it's part of the game.
---
Nono, she was offered a whiskey but politely declined.

I just started using joana's and I'm really liking it. Can't offer a comparison though.
---
Tooga never let's me ride on his back  :(

(yes I know there is a  kodo hidden underneath)
---
Charge, hamstring, /wave.
---
Took me about 12 hours to get to level 10 on the first night of release
---
Yeah, that's a good way to significantly increase your travel time.
---
Shaman, for a true meme.
---
That's a good point. There are probably situations where it has saved me time too of waiting. Guess it comes down to if the sudden spawns are gonna cause me to (nearly) die or not xD
---
 As a paladin you don't need gold for a level 40 mount. One tip I would give, and people might disagree, is to look in the AH often and spend your money constantly. Provided you are spending it on smart things of course.
---
 For example, I am playing warlock, lvl 30. Have a lvl 26 druid alt that has 190 tailoring/225 alchemy. Will level that toon up to 35 no more, just so I can learn 300 professions.
---
 I am constantly broke because I am spending my cash buying recipes specifically. The rationale is that early on a server people are selling hard to find recipes for very cheap compared to what they will cost later on.
---
 Have been able to buy savory deviate delight recipe for 2.5g some days ago, elixir of mongoose 3g yesterday etc. Deviate delight recipe costs like 8g now on the server and I expect mongoose to rise as well. Probably mongoose will end up at like 20g at least I would think later on.
---
 Also   leveling up alchemy has been incredibly easy. With mats being as inexpensive as they are at the moment I was able to break even pretty much. Herbs are starting to get a bit to expensive, frost oil for example is not profitable anymore but for a while I was able to earn like 50s per frost oil with instant sells. If anything I have earned money getting 225 alchemy. Tailoring is net loss though but it's not to bad.
---
Yea, let me just get off those 50 casts to make 5 stacks of the water I just learned
---
Well mr, or ms, special; another way to read that sentence is: first i wanted to rush, but then i realised NOT rushing is more fun. Person 2: the way you are playing now is more fun to you than rushing, which you were going to do before, so NOW you are playing correctly.
---
Bro: if English is hard for you to understand, dont try to be smart. Youre obviously not.
---
Found the Alliance scumbag!
---
If it's not "world 1st", then it's a server 1st, if the world 1st wasn't already done on that server, so the claim doesn't count.
---
In my mind this is an awesome thing. It shows the heart of a game and some of the players inside it. 
---
The one thing my heart screams is alliance sympathizer and that you didn't live up to you being a horde and them alliance scum. Our quest is more important than a few points of xp, Lok'tar Ogar!
---
How can exploits be real if our eyes aren't real?
---
As a Horde. Am I able to do quests from Wetlands? For example. I want to do this. (Ormer's Revenge)\[ [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=296/ormers-revenge#comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=296/ormers-revenge#comments) \] Quest  but it's in Wetlands. Will I be able to accept it?
---
Have to use MCP? Every time I think of rolling druid I remember that people move expect me to go farm those (for 5 man, no interest in Mt role of gold) and decide I'm not gonna roll a druid.
---
If Peter Griffin was an orc!
---
You use a fast off-hand to get more instant poison procs, a heavy hitting main hand for SS damage
---
Thanks :)
---
*cries in scarab lord*
---
Hey man thanks again lol, that was awesome.
---
I don’t understand people like this. It’s literally free for a mage and takes like 1 minute to give someone a few stacks.. I’m more than happy to give them the good stuff!
---
been thinking on trying to get this on my ench sham is it BiS for all of classic?
---
spartanUI
---
Yeah demo roar is nuts too. Way too hard on healer mana with no block though.
---
Yup, I'm sure a lot of people in vanilla had no idea it was a low drop rate and would either equip it and sell it when they got higher level or would just vendor it.
---
I mean I gotta be honest I've had a completely different experience, most people I've grouped up with have been very social and made sure that everyone's done with their relevant quests before leaving, especially when doing elites.
---
I feel like the named quest mobs take ages, but the annoying ones in the area seem instant.
---
Gate keeping much you troll?
---
Recasting does nothing. Will gives 5 sec immunity.
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak pettiness looks like.
---
No, it's necessary.
---
I've never been with someone who had saggy boobs but I saw a few in my time, kinda feel bad for those women. 
---
In the same way that I feel bad for midgets or handicapped people, I'd never mock it but having been bullied as a child I know it can't be easy going through life with certain things.
---
Maybe I am overthinking this.
---
Do people work with dkp again or how is loot distributed nowadays?
---
That is sort of what I was thinking. As someone who missed the WoW train and has been playing classic since launch to get that feeling of fully vanilla WoW I'm just taken aback by these kinds of people, it's literally advertised as a social experience.
---
Funny as this joke is, it's always struck a bad chord with me. Why marry if you can't enjoy your hobbies once in a while, or meet your friends? Marriage is all about compromise between people, but at times it seems like people are willing to be the one who does all the compromising.
---
I miss some of my friends, alright.
---
But I just moved back into my old room and everything!
---
Fucking stupid, hobbies are best used to help people stay grounded and use it as a release from work. Not another way to create fucking financial stress, (wow $15 sub lul)
---
Had a great one yesterday. Me and 2 others were standing in a cave waiting for a bear to spawn (for about 5 mins). It spawns we tag it and out of nowhere a stealthed warrior trys to tag the bear first.
---
Dickhead was hiding to try and tag it before we did. Totally failed, and had to wait for the next spawn.
---
Why not just ask to join the group! We didn't even know he was there due to shadowmeld.
---
The item linked by OP was an epic shield so that's what I was talking about. Sure for normal green crap everyone can do whatever , i agree with you there. 
---
But for things like freezing band, edgemaster gauntlets, stockade pauldrons.. imo those are all need all the time and always have been. We even dobit for blue boes too based on the same criteria you literally cant reliably farm specific ones.. so anyone saying they should get it for free bc of being present in a 5man where it dropped is being a slight combination of ignorant/entitled and not really understanding what kind of loot tables they are working with.
---
I was in the guild &lt;hero&gt; but I could never get into the server and I was forced to switch to a lower pop realm. I really wanted to be a part of it but sadly I can’t logon until 6:00pm st the earliest every night, and face 2-4 hour long queues.
---
Grats on rag. I watched sonii’s stream when you were clearing MC Thursday night.
---
Good luck!
---
Must suck to be a gnome/dwarf that is still in the begining stage of the game.
---
Druids are better until... BWL where they cant tank Chro or Nefarian very well.
---
RIP everybody trying to PvP against the dude who gets it.

But down rank res does exist. They just come back with low health.

He’s going to enjoy getting his mount before level 48.

Im also doing mining/eng and so far doesn't seem to be a money maker. Coarse stone seems to have a nice AH price but Eng is really metal intensive. A lot of nice Eng stuff requires that skill making it unappetizing on the AH.
---
In my opinion, use your mining to train up Eng. Youll make sweet stuff for yourself. Maybe AH some extra gems and stones.
---
/charge they die... well shit
---
The point of classic is to enjoy every stade of the game again with its imperfections. No need to worry about the future, just enjoy the game.
---
Of course it feels completed, it's nothing new, it's about a game we already completed! There will be no new bosses, no new tactics, no new races/classes.
---
How many Shadow Priests?
---
It's two-fold:  Officers are more likely to be a valuable asset to the guild than a random raider/trial will be. They have more responsibility, so it's possible the guild will favor giving it to an officer.
---
Or alternatively, the massively blown out of proportion hysteria regarding loot councils and how they operate (officers don't actually steal all the loot, otherwise there'd be nobody to steal loot from after 2 weeks).
---
I'll gladly fear you so you'll run back the opposite direction cx

Best weapon in game at phase 1 is Bone Reaver's Edge. Also, this will take months to craft, by that time Phase 2 will be out with even better weapons.

Response: Lol no.

Next.
---
I’m on a full pop realm and air t an hour looking for a tank for Mara.
---
Taking 30 minutes to form a group will be quite normal.

As a enhance shaman I haven't had issues and I'm lvl 28
---
Yeah people, please don't be like this arsehole. If you've got space in your group or someone invites you then group up. Don't be stubborn and end up having to wait longer. These guys didn't invite me and I solo tagged the mob as my tauren and I got a lot of death threats which was funny.

The Healbot addon is a healers best friend.. but before I found out about that I just had my mouse scroll on the character portraits and hit like 1,2,3 etc for whatever healing spell was on my bars..

&lt;---  sick of all these dog lovers
---
I've seen both sides of that coin and honestly I'm pretty sure it's just fucking difficult to tune that all perfectly.

Go on...

oh trust me my friend, my level 19 lowbie exterminator will be camped out in redridge well before phase 3 hits.
---
Just imagine people being able to do it daily, people whould hate the place after 2 moths because they feel obliged to maximize their raid drop income.
---
Typically, people will use mouseover healing, either with a macro or with an add-on. This means your healing spell will target whomever your mouse is currently hovering over whenever you press the keybind for the spell.
---
Combine this with raid-frames, and you are just playing a game of moving your mouse around the raid-frames (but not clicking), and pressing keys.

We got a full group of 5, just took down the Forsaken Courier for the folded note, when some jackass pally drops party, and starts the escort quest without us... I promptly pull over some mobs when he AOEd
---
You only need MCP as a feral if you're on DPS duty or if your raid is doing serious buff stacking during progression.
---
Wait. What the hell. No one else was in a queue last night on whitemane. Is blizzard just targeting me and made me wait an hour. WTF blizzard. It's because I'm playing a druid huh. 
---
(And yes /s if it's not obvious enough).
---
But to be honest of course the number of users will go down. Queue times will decrease or go away (thank God) But there are tons of players just like me that are done with retail and will unsubscribe if they pull classic. So if blizzard can make money they will.
---
Its a bit sad how _close_ some of these specs are to being good at least. Prot pally just needs a taunt, ret could really take off with crusader strike. Same with all the other poo poo specs. Just a small change away

---
I highly suggest that you get over your mental block about addons especially for healing.
---
You don't need much, but they really help you out and make your life so much easier.
---
My 2 cents for healing addons:
---
1) Clique 
---
(this addon lets you to bind heals spells to your different mouse buttons so you can just click the right target's frame with appropriate skill)
---
2) Get some unit frame addon that lets you customize your party frames better to make usage of Clique even easier
---
This should be more than enough for healing in my opinion. One tip for Classic that is not addon related is that you need to use different ranks of same spells to heal efficiently. You can't always spam the highest rank or you will run out of mana. You should be able to customize Clique for different ranks of spells as well (shift click for Rank X, normal click for rank Y)
---
Perhaps on dead servers, gold is down to 1$ per 1g on Gehennas and will just drop further
---
Yeah. People who were stacking tribute buff, songflower buff, ZG buff, onyxia buff, were doing it because they wanted to. Not because they needed to. There is an important distinction. The only guy I knew who stacked so many buffs also brought full consumables and topped the meters. We would have cleared the content even if he wasn't doing all of that but he did it so he could be on top of the DPS meter.

I don't ask if they want water or food.

I just spam trade until they accept it.

they were added in a later patch
---
That's awesome! Can you explain how you did it? I would love to go check it out myself.
---
I was so caught off guard I also was cry laughing lmao! Even though I could tell it was gonna be good and started screen capping, I still didn't expect the punchline to be so perfect haha
---
You also lose all the gold from not vendoring gear, as well as spending 15g, it’s probably cost you closer to 40g.
---
Dildos are one of the hugely obvious and easy ones to make money with. Just turn on a webcam and sign up on Chaturbate.
---
It's even equippable so even if you don't sell it it's a perfect hunter weapon!
---
What's it do? Do you consider it a musthave?
---
It's a bank boat

Protip: you can disable chat invites in the social settings
---
Without any addons I would simply mouse over the portrait of player I wanted to heal, click it and hit my heal bind. 
---
I never used a healing addon either and did just fine. I did however change all my healing keybinds to mouse over macros. It simply saved me the additional click on the portrait.
---
You dont use PWS on tanks unless an emergency. Save that for group members or yourself. Renew is a bit of a waste imo and at 20 you should dump lesser heal unless its for group members not the tank. At 20 you get heal, which replaces lesser heal for tank healing. Basically let the tank get low enough that heal wont overheal. That way youll be casting as few spells as possible and getting the most out of the 5 second rule
---
Did you farm the pummelers? Please show your spec and gear!! I want to do this on my dudu too
---
Its not that I don't believe you, but I really do not believe your story.
---
This happen to me in SFK , never once saw the robes drop, and I ran it over 20 times in one day, just bad luck.
---
I’m level 8 and I generally pull mobs with lvl 1 frostbolt for slow, fireball and fire blast till dead.
---
You don't need any healing addons to be a good healer, but you really do need to learn mouseover macros. This will allow you to keep your tank targeted at all times, but can heal a DPS by hovering your mouse over them. Here's an example:  
---
\#showtooltip Regrowth
---
/cast \[@mouseover,help\]\[help,nodead\]\[@targettarget,help,nodead\]\[@player\] Regrowth
---
This is for my Druid, but you can replace "Regrowth" with whatever your healing spells are called. If you select the ? mark icon, the #showtooltip will change the icon to the spell name. Then you just put this on your bars like regular spells.
---
I'm only level 20 on him, which is where druids become a lot easier to level cos they get cat form. So now its great.
---
Justice boner
---
Wade in.  Joke around.  You'll be fine.  Sticks and stones etc.
---
This was a forum post from back in the day?
---
I have it on my shaman on Pserver. It's not as good as you would think. The stats/proc arent great, but it's still decent damage until C'thun's 2h.
---
Better than all the Trump worship and racism that's usually in Barrens chat
---
you have the alliance guide?

---
Its also funny how that crowd _loves_ to use the whole “I dont trust Blizz” when it comes to defending their no change stance, but we know the real reason. Those people like playing a solved game. They like that they know which classes/specs are weak and they know that by rolling class X spec Y they will be the best. Basically, its self preservation
---
&gt;  Were talking paying off the entirety of your epic mount. 
---
Who waits 6 months or more sitting on this to then buy their epic mount? lol
---
Just sell it now for 150g or whatever and invest that into future high volume trade goods.
---
Sell it and buy cheap elemental earth or black lotus, sell it and boost your professions up so you can start making gold with that earlier, sell it and scan for cheap high-end patterns you can flip or learn (flasks, lionheart etc.).
---
Don't sit on fairly expensive items waiting for them to become super expensive. It could end up not being the case. It could end up being such high competition that yours won't sell until Naxx is cleared.
---
Well yeah but why? instead of 0.001% total hp at max rank rez you get 0.00001% max hp and a gnat sneezing in Silithus kills you again.
---
Seriously though, the extra hp is just a bonus, the point is rezzing and as long as you do that, people are gonna be happy.
---
And "mob" means "not a player", rezzing mobs is not something that is possible.
---
You literally just copy and pasted a post that has been around for so long that it's actually still hosted on Photobucket from 2005
---
https://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x302/algorath/ReasontoplayPaladin.jpg
---
Basically, boss that have an enrage at low health are usually a bad idea because a war tank would use shield wall there.
---
Also nefarian that randomly change you into a cat.
---
Most boss you can tank fine as a druid, and on a few boss druids are  better than warrior
---
Thats pretty much as good as it gets until Corpsemaker at 29, damn
---
I cringe every time skull people try to gank but I just swap on a shield and run, somehow everyone is super bad at running in a straight line when there is some terrain
---
Can you still skill up from the invulnerable mobs around the Dark Portal? I don't think that was fixed until at least BC, perhaps not until wSkill was removed. Paladins at least should have little difficultly doing that if they run Seal of Light, it was a particularly handy trick to level your Unarmed skill back in the day. 
---
(sorry Warriors)
---
So his loyalty level is 1 and rebellious, but his happiness is a green smile. I fed him a stack of five lvl 5 haunches of meat. How do I know if I'm good to be sure he won't disappear?
---
You guy's should still try socialise a bit along the way :), your missing out on some fun aspects potentially meeting new pals and stuff, even if dont have much time its just still to have bros to chat too and potentially have them help you out   
---
. Dont be afraid to join a guild too for dungeons etc, the more they know about you the more understanding/wana help out etc, if you were on rattlegore wed be happy to let you come along things even if you had to bail for bits and pieces :).   
---
but yeah if people give u grief, even after they receive explanations like that, my word are their thoughts not to be worried about haha.
---
What kind of level 10-20 has 10g to give away?
---
I play wow. Don’t need no damn table.
---
I would remove the debuff limits on bosses. It just hurts certain classes and specs severely for no discernable reason.
---
Those darn kids. Guys. I’ve the reddit ap on my phone. It took me 3 seconds to take the pic and post. Everyone calm down! IMNOTYELLINGYOUREYELLING!
---
Isn't Warden Staff BiS for tank druids for almost all of classic?
---
imagine thinking choosing a faction in a video game defines your moral compass.
---
I still hate the place all these years later just doing it weekly because we still wanted the right binding from Geddon for Thunderfury.
---
Never dropped, we ended up with 7 people in possession of the left.
---
I have a couple odd requests for you...
---
My brother and his gf broke up a while back. He got back into WoW to cope, then he got her into WoW. They're married now
---
It’s why so many people love vanilla. It forced you to be sociable and rely on other people, as they’d rely on you, to *finally* finish that one damn stubborn quest. It taught you mechanics that you’d use in raids and PvP without you even realizing it.
---
OP, off topic here but do you know how to extend the range at which enemy nameplates pop up in ElvUI? I'm sure I toggled the setting in the menu but it's really buggy for me on classic and it didn't work.
---
I have to get really close to see any nameplates.
---
Baader-Meinhof phenomenon
---
Yep. Going for like 500g on Skeram
---
That's about the dumbest argument I've heard.  I'm not a chef either but I can tell when a steak is overcooked.  Once again though, you're just avoiding addressing the comment you are replying to.  Pathetic.
---
Hmm, maybe it's a native thing? You can test it though, it does highlight the lowest selling trash item. If you sell it, it will tag the next lowest one, etc.
---
They hate any hobby that doesn’t produce money or doesn’t directly involve them; I think it actually highlights fundamental relationship problems.
---
Make sure it’s done eating the first bit of food, I made the mistake of spamming food on it early and it doesn’t stack, just keep the happiness at green and don’t let it die a lot

I would be grateful to find out where this is from! Been searching for something similar for a long time

I've destroyed the  plastic spring in countless n64 controllers spinning the joystick on my palm in those mini games. The river boat game and tug of war were the worst.
---
*Most undead NPCs are immune. 
---
And yea, Necrosis is a freaking great addon to have for locks. It has a built in dot tracker too.
---
Fake news. The enh talent is around a 30-90ap bonus. 
---
Which is to say, it's between a 2-6 DPS boost depending on what rank you have.
---
Mule*
---
Oh amen
---
He just took aggro and somehow survived.
---
Best thing I did was run to Lakeshire at level 9, grab the flight point, and continue on my way. Made things a lot easier in the defias questline.
---
But why? Youll be taken to BRD, Strat, etc as holy in your early 50’s anyway. Might as well level and grind pre bis at the same time.
---
I believe so!
---
Pathetic. 
---
Grow up dude, you’re not smart or cool or whatever you think you’re doing here
---
I did a charge in Ashenvale off a ledge and it took me around nearly the entire map to get to the mob.
---
That's the joke.
---
yes.
---
Queue time doesnt matter, the number in line does. I've had it say less than one minute with 12k ahead of me
---
Yeah my ex was like that , single life rocks , CLASSIC
---
The loyalty goes up slowly over time. You have to keep him both alive and happy for long durations. When he’s rebellious you have to feed him more often. As he continues to become more tame you can feed him less. Best thing to do is feed him food every time his green smile goes yellow and keep him alive and summoned.
---
Depends on the price, I can see that some groups would rather grab the cash than give one member an item upgrade.
---
He seems to type to create the toxicity wherever he goes rather than it already being there.
---
I don't dispute that part
---
The drop chance for that staff is 0.0016%  
---
what do you mean high competition?
---
Best is subjective. If youre solo on a pvp server, yes. But holy isnt far behind at all in terms of damage, and it makes healing a ton easier once you get to ZF and later runs
---
The guy on the throne is named Ez
---
I get hamstringed and the warrior gets dead at least once, maybe more. Don't charge a frost mage.
---
I’m so sorry to ruin this for you but I’m trustytrash on gehennas, orc warrior. I hope your nightelf buddy was a great companion tho! Your search continues!
---
This fact on top of people saying their spec when they are literally lvl15 makes me loco
---
Clearly a horde/shaman player.
---
Nightmare-fuel.
---
This is great!
---
If that's the case Joana still holds the levelling record then.
---
I think so yeah, might depend on what instances you are planing to farm
---
Did this on Thursday, and I've never felt more proud of an in-game accomplishment. I was lucky enough to have the locals group up to help. For BFD I actually got two pallys on the same quest. (Thank you, Atiesh, I couldn't have done this alone)
---
Now I can DE every weapon I find for 20 levels!
---
:D
---
Grats, brother.  
---
Light be with you.
---
Doesn’t mean you have to spend all your time ganking. Also doesn’t automatically put you on farm.
---
In vanilla? Yes. In classic? I don't know, has anyone done it faster? If so, then no.
---
Except thats not true?
---
Double click drain soul during wanding and it will cast it when next possible
---
Personally I much prefer Clique over Healbot. I know Healbot is the OG but there's just too much going on for me. Clique is much more lightweight and you don't need to go through several menus trying to tweak it. It also doesn't change the default raid frames. @OP it really just comes down to personal preference, what works and feels the best for you.
---
UTA? go mavs?
---
I know this sounds relatively funny, but I've only been at my new job for a month and I've been having a really hard time coming up with an extra 15$. My plasma donations go to gas and diapers and my checks are going towards bills and debts. 
---
I've been excited for classic and I can finally renew my sub coming up this week, I'm late, but I'm really excited!
---
That's why we created a channel called Layer on the Skeram server.
---
This is the whole reason transmog farming is a thing in retail =P
---
Because I'd rather be on one high population server than be on one of nine low population servers.
---
Also just hitting forward one time will stop wanding.
---
I just play peggle.
---
I swear harpies npc icon looks like a dwarf with goggles
---
Its a bug, because of its larger size the hitbox sometimes goes below the terrain. You will need to send in a ticket for a chance at this being fixed, good luck and happy questing.
---
Because Warrior's can PvP with other weapons much better (Bonereaver's edge) while this is the absolute best weapon for Paladin/Shaman.  
---
The proc becomes most effective with Seal of Command's extra swing or Reckoning (5 swings in 0.1 second). Mace Spec Warrior without Windfury cannot access to extra swings other than 2% chance Hand of Justice.
---
Shaman by far, I’ve seen maybe 5 shamans all together but many many rogues, priests, druids, warriors, warlocks, and the most played is definitely mages
---
Warriors cant hit the def cap either
---
There will always be more than enough players to fill several servers.  Some guilds on Herod and Faerelina etc have over 350 online members most nights.  You’re wishing for a scenario where the game is dead.
---
thing is that number keeps on going up, i started with less than 1500 i'm at 3k right now
---
Fr tho can't wait till all the #nochanges autists realize there's gonna be changes after naxx cause blizzard isn't gonna let classic wither and die.
---
Yeah, I saw a guy once say that he doesn't wanna play on an RP realm because he doesn't want to walk in dungeons. ???????
---
Just jump to stop cast then cast drain.
---
Its so strange to me how some humans think that random events deserve some sort of recognition or credit.  There isn't anything noteworthy here. Just dumb luck.
---
World first means nothing in this sense. Neither does the fact that it's 'by venture-flamelash(eu)'. 
---
I guess every time somebody wins a lot of money on a brand new slot machine it should be posted to r/gaming and any other relevant place.
---
It’s awesome but wdym it took 3 weeks?  It’s original artwork by blizzard with a quote from South Park
---
Buddy, in any American court, that’s your share...
---
That's because they opened server transfers and possibly lifted the player cap at the same time.
---
Haha ... crushed!
---
i think weakauras does that, but it's .. a little complex to set up.
---
but once you learn the rules of how to write out your skills you want to track it's kind of simple IIRC
---
BUT!
---
if you combine omnicc and classic aura durations, i find this really minimalistic and provides a lot of the info  you are asking for.
---
on the target frame where it shows the debuffs you put on, there will now be a countdown on it and an animation so you can know exactly when it will drop.
---
but if that doesn't do it for you then i think weakauras will
---
You even asked super nicely as well, that mage is a knob.
---
You soloed the entire quest chain at level 23? Might give it a shot myself.
---
*Laughs in Phase 1*
---
Mid 20s-mid 30s is majority from what I’ve seen
---
Well yeah in general, druid, rogue, shaman are the 3 most fun for me. I love a class that involves a meta level of mind-games in pvp, and those classes have a solid amount of that.
---
Not really but feel free to make assumptions like that. 
---
Also rate the fact you instantly down voted my comment and replied. Blizzard doesn't need a fuccboi defence force.
---
Started about 4 days after Launch too. Only on 19 :(
---
Just to add onto your first point: Any key works, not just mouse buttons. Clique is my go-to every time, it's even useful when you aren't healing.
---
Let's make it happen Turbo. I mean shit I also live near the indy speedway, we could recreate the movie for you!
---
We kept doing it for Paladin T2 (can't really blame em for wanting this)
---
It's a fun raid to progress through but after over a year of clearing it every week it's kinda dull.
---
Either or. Horde can get a bit more value out of 2hand from windfury procs, and 2hand has a lower hit% requirement.
---
I vendored mine on retail years ago. I’m sooooo excited to get it back in classic. I Will never get rid of it again.
---
What kind of people are you playing with? Try finding a proper guild (or any stable community) with mature members. Our guild has lots of girls and nobody treats them any different
---
That's because of dynamic respawns. If multiple groups are in the area killing then mobs respawn faster
---
We had a Warrior MT but our Druid was a fuckin god, he saved so many boss attempts, he was our hero.
---
Genius!
---
Idk, man, looks from here like you went all the way to his throne to take it up the ass
---
Farming Murlocs... Now that's a brave guy!
---
yeah, its just if I'm in guild/party chat I sometimes send ty to the wrong chat window!
---
I'm quite sure he "escaped"
---
I like this one better.  
---
It's also impressive you don't have the bars on your screen
---
How did you get that?
---
Thing is, you'll have to pay the dkp or be prominent in the guild enough to get the Eye of Divinity drop. So unless you will be performing well enough for it to get looted to you through lot council, or raiding enough to out bid with dkp, it's going to be tough for you to get it with not taking healing serious in a raid.   
---
I'm in the same spot actually. I want to go shadow post anthema but I play solo mostly so I want to be shadow as much af possible.
---
I just ask in normal chat and they ignore me. Rarely get a group going for things and when I do, the group usually tends to be cool. I try to help em out for helping me out. I remember when I was doing a kill quest, asked a bunch of people multiple times if they were doing the quest too and wanted to group up - they ignored me until I started killing everything that would spawn because they didn't think a Warrior would be capable of tagging anything at a low level. They tried to invite me but I had just finished the quest and declined, they had to then wait and compete with even more people because as I was leaving about 3 groups full of people popped up in the area to start the quest and it was glorious karma at work.
---
INV me to new layer please!!!
---
That's a rookie move.
---
Roll elemental shaman at 40 and do 5-10 pushups every time you drink water.
---
Have fun not being able to move your mouse after 1 day.
---
RP server in itself doesn't have to be a bad idea. I play on Zandalar Tribe RP-PVP EU and have had 95% positive experiences.
---
*Laughs in Warlock*
---
what do you mean its 2005 everyones using it
---
Yeah, I'll be using tanking gear, but not protection talents, so I dont need to respec for fury in raids and prot while tanking dungeons
---
BoS on your raid, Righteous Fury talented for 90% threat from holy attacks = your judgement pretty much being a taunt
---
I found broken tooth twice in 1 hour, got ganked and i flipped out and then i got him alone
---
Press shift+number should switch to a secondaire  action bar(you can also click the arrow next to your action bar)
---
I would say exactly the opposite, actually. if a boss's adds take about a minute to kill and 8 to respawn\\, that means going slow and methodical is actively discouraged since you have to hurry your ass up to get the boss down before shit spawns on your ass.
---
Is it because Tauren are usually good boys? Because we are. We're good fuckin' boys.
---
Follow up: I joined the channel just to tell them to F\*\*\* off. I know it doesn't do anything but I felt better.
---
I keep getting dps that decided "the tank walking into a mob , so i'm going to wand / attack that one right away" 
---
whits basically leads into, okay, 2 mobs it is, because i'm not hitting any mob yet and i've already lost agro on the first one because you attack it before I pulled 4 more.
---
Lmaoo same. Salty af
---
Name checks out.
---
Don't be a pos. You're being a pos.

Lol man i think there is a joke about married couples in here...

TBC was actually really good

and so was WotLK until ICC.
---
Get a life.

I think you have to do one menial quest. Super trivial.
---
I hope not. Not even paid. Also no barber etc.
---
I keep it at the bottom left, always had. Not sure why
---
This is total BS twitch a video of of you charging packs of equal level mobs. You’re full of it.
---
does Priest lvling become more fun at higher lvls? wands seems so strong that all my other spells feel kinda useless.
---
well there's 4 dragons and 4 locations. Which dragon is at which location is random. There's a priority list, but the respawns of the drakes don't start untill they are all dead - so guilds killing them will kill all four.   
---
Odds are that world bosses will be dominated by only the most hardcore guilds, willing to afk scout 24/7 and wake up in the middle of the night to kill them.
---
Here's your medal.  0&lt;=
---
Even as a DPS player myself imagine having that much of an attitude as a DPS. It'd be quicker for the group to kick him and find a new mage than it will be waiting every 3rd pull for the healer to regen mana.
---
Purely my opinion but I feel it is better to just quest and level rather than sweating gear along the way. Once you hit 60 you can worry about gear more. That said, you shouldn't be wearing lvl 18 gear at lvl 50 either.
---
“The Kodos must be protected.”
---
Had a simillar situation with a druid, inside a cave. The mob spawns after 10mins and I slay it, then hit him with the "Better luck next time :)" as i HS out. FeelsGoodMan
---
Come join MAGA, we keep it real.
---
Asians miss part of their chin? okay
---
He has 3 spawn points
---
Why sorry? You're allowed to be wrong sometimes.
---
We had a druid off-tank a good chunk of Naxx bosses, so it's far from a meme spec. I think people just remember how bad feral tanking was in early Vanilla, before the patches really beefed them up.
---
I've got a level 16 night elf and a level 15 dwarf. I split my play time between the two.... The elf is my solo character and the dwarf I play with my husband.
---
Just want respect. I hated healing classic raids.
---
Exactly, op is just one of those holier than thou healers. Fuckin mercy mains.
---
Uhhhh #nochanges I mean if you want that just go play retail I mean you probably already are so I don't need to change your mind on playing that garbage version of the game. youre probably only going to get to level 20 and quit anyways because you just can't handle the classic experience. just have to learn to start over. this experience was made for me so even small cosmetic things will deeply affect my own personal enjoyment of the game I mean come on you casual learn to play a man's game

dude i kind of enjoy it. even small shit. like some dude asking for SW flight path in general. 
---
i also like just interacting with people in this game.
---
was in westfall doing the messenger quest, actually found someone else on it, and so the messenger pops and we kill him.
---
there was another human near us, not in out party who saw it all 
---
"he was resisting" i say.
---
my party membber doesn't miss a beat
---
"he was reaching for his weapon"
---
then we turn to the witness
---
"you saw it too... right? or do we need to.. silence you?"
---
and then we just crowded around him 
---
' ooooh buddy you're in trouble'
---
You’ve heard? Well, that’s good enough for me. Please close thread the definitive answer is right here.

I got him this morning. Just came to Badlands. Layering and luck saved me many hours. When layering is gone, it will be a pain.

Naaah, both things happen on both sides :)

Oh look another Horde player getting unnecessarily defensive about the team he plays in his video game as if the Horde don’t do the same god damn thing.

No such thing as 'behind' as long as you are enjoying what you're doing. It's not a race to 60..... You'll get there eventually. 
---
I have a level 16 and a level 15.... I enjoy playing them both.
---
I see nothing wrong with what I said
---
Tanking gear relies on protection talents. You need the block chance and amount, you need the increased threat, you need the shield block charges...
---
...I'm in
---
It's not unusual for people to get their mount at 50+. as a druid your travel form is a pretty good replacement, won't lose as much from not having a mount as let's say a warrior
---
Roughly 10%

I like flying through Barrens and dropping a troll bomb then flying away.

Guaranteed bait.

I have almost 100 hours in /played and I'm level 35. Most of my guild are lower level than me. There is only like 3 level 60 on my server. Most people seem to be around level 30 though I think.
---
I see a lot of people asking about gearing like they don't stop to think that this games been played for sixteen years and it's solved 100% already lol
---
These fights are freaking amazing on pvp servers. That has little to do with you question, just wanted to tack that on.
---
I was unable to get rid of their minimap in a clean mannor, or the right side chat box. It always left behind black boarders or stuff I couldn't shut off. That shit needs a "let me turn on the things I want" button instead of it completely changing every possible thing for you.
---
Then he bopped you so hard you got sent to a grave yard.
---
Ctrl shift escape, this ain't 2004
---
Thanks, but I'd also like to switch my additional hotbars.
---
Intellect and Agility.
---
Why is the only thing you can say ''go play retail?'' My highest character on retail is 71 and that's because I don't like retail wow.. You just told me that I will only hit level 20 yet I said in the title that My orc shaman on CLASSIC WOW is level 32. Seems like that you're not only retarded but you can't read either.
---
Dead when no queue confirmed!
---
No, druid is better until Thunderfury. Druid has more mitigation and higher threat generation for a while.
---
0/30/21 or 1/29/21 if you ever pvp

The feral point can be moved around a bit for more bear or cat:)

raiding joke :)

not if they are afk
---
ok nub question, what’s the added benefit of taming brokentoof?
---
Addon forget the name off the top of my head.
---
How is looting a random drop impressive lol
---
I don’t have print scrn on my keyboard. But I think y’all are missing the point. What’s the point in taking issue with this? Y’all are weird
---
Yes, relatively only a few people used it. 
---
Just like relatively only a few people read Reddit compared to all the casuals that just play the game. 
---
But that doesn’t mean the people if the top guild didn’t use every advantage they could get to win the race to the top.
---
Friendly reminder that anything that performs even 5% worse than the top theorycrafted option, is in fact: trash.
---
Druid tanks are a meme-spec? Since when? Druids are the second best main tank in the game.
---
Weird how there’s more to the game than dpsing.
---
You can sort of tell by the lfg spam, it moves with the majority of the herd. In my server it's mostly SM lfg so I'd say mid 30s is the average.
---
They were ordered to find a disease so nasty that it can kill the scourge.  When you are badly outnumbered and have no allies, a weapon that can keep killing after you are wiped out seems a great idea.  The Forsaken Blight is  the perfect weapon against the Scourge in theory.  It is nasty enough to hit undead; virulent enough to melt flesh off bones and deny the Scourge more undead to reanimate other than weak skeletons.
---
The major issue is that its development is being left to a quasi independent group of Forsaken whose ultimate oversight is a Dreadlord of questionable true loyalty.
---
You'll be already 2/5ths of a stealth run:)
---
I actually replaced Verigan's Fist with Corpsemaker from RFK, but I still swap to Verigans Fist for healing
---
I'm Alliance on Herod and I see plenty of Ally players all the time.
---
I have no doubt that the Horde outnumber is by a fair bit but I don't think it's as drastic as you're insinuating. There was a big Hillsbrad vs. Southshore a day or two ago and it ended up fairly even at one point. Horde started out really high and then a bunch of Ally showed up and it felt fairly even.
---
Nobody:
---
Absolutely nobody:
---
/u/KzFox_AoV: Was just farming Murlocs then this dropped...
---
Layering's entire purpose is to help keep questing congestion low. If you're asking to swap literally because your area has too many people collecting the same thing, isn't that just using it as it should be used?
---
I mean obviously there's a minority of people abusing it, but Blizz already has plans for tweaking the system to counteract that.
---
According to the census addon on my server the majority of people fall within the lvl 15-23 range.
---
Don't you have to be reported over and over for spamming in order to get a ban?
---
Biologically there’s a difference actually haha. Female breast are like x% breast tissue and x% fat. Fat males have just fat.
---
Lol this is perfect!
---
Pserver player sure brought alot of cancer. Not sure what's worse their community of the twitch community.
---
I believe Hillsbrad is from late teens to late 20s.
---
Druid can MT any dungeon and most raid bosses
---
Watch skarm on youtube if you're in doubt
---
Yea people are really stupid about this stuff
---
Probably won’t happen but damn do I want them to add realm transfers. I’d pay just like on retail to get on the same server as my friends.
---
I'll try it sometime
---
Mouseover macros + party frames that give you enough information about the debuffs on your party is pretty much all you need. Mouseovers so you can keep your current target (good for dpsing the boss/trash in your downtime or keeping a closer eye on a mob you need to interrupt) and just put your mouse over the party frame of the person you need to heal without actually having to change targets. You need frames that will show what debuffs your party is afflicted with so you can better predict the damage coming in or healing you’ll need to put out because of dots/healing/armor debuffs ect. I also like to display major defensive CD’s that my party members (not raid, it gets too cluttered showing too much info) use for the same reason. If a mage is sitting in iceblock i know i have time to heal other people who may need it more urgently.
---
Overpower only usable in battle stance, zerker rage only usable in berzerker stance.
---
Charging for water is crazy as well though, there isn't a cost - we should only charge for ports

If she hires an Expert Lawyer instead of just a Journeyman that wont be a problem

As a horde player, you’d be lucky to not have had two spells hit you from me before you get to charge. No love for alliance.
---
WHAAAATTT??!?!!? Are you serious? My day of sitting at work doing nothing just got both 10x better and worse. Now i have something to look forward to but i also have to wait 8 hrs before i can check it out. Blarg. Thanks for the update, ill check it out when i get home.
---
Super annoying all the people still playing this game for loot or "firsts." Idk when loot and bragging rights became more appealing than content but I'm glad I never got that memo.
---
Gahaah horde downvoted. Like yes there’s the few nice people but on average horde is aggressive and will kill on sight whereas majority of alliance are not aggressive. If you think otherwise you better wake up lol
---
3 charges and it's gone. You need to farm this item on repeat each week.

Technically 8, but realistically 3.  Shaman, hunter, and warrior.

Super Adventure Clubs sub division?

It's stuff like "scaling up lvl 20s in the bg so everyone can play" and that makes me not want to play. Why should someone who hasn't put in any effort to level (leveling is so easy in retail vs classic) be able to perform anywhere near someone who's spent effort to make it to end game?
---
Worthy of goldshire,
---
Don’t waste your money
---
Ayy I sure did! Named him Styx from Greek mythology.
---
try the trainer in TB
---
Also me, a tauren druid
---
Yes, yes you do
---
It doesn’t but from a role play persp when you’re a horde undead rogue you probably have no qualms about killing anyone on sight. When you’re a alliance paladin most likely you’re the type of player that just walks by everyone.
---
If you honestly think horde is more aggressive then you’re the one who needs to wake up lol. They’re both the same, just because alliance is seen as “the good guy” faction doesn’t mean they wont gank hordes
---
The real question here : how the fuck do you already have a “main” that can give out 10 gold my god
---
I have had a smooth run for the most part on Arugal.
---
Haha fuck thats brutal.
---
Psychic scream can make them even more annoying to MC, too. Runs them through every room in the damn boat at 300% move speed
---
BFA is made for people who can feel empathy?
---
Here's the thing: servers have way way more space than original servers had, exactly for the reason they don't die out when the initial hype is gone. 
---
In order to keep the game playable with so many players, there's a thing called layering. On each servers there exist several "layers", that act like independent instances of the game world.
---
Each one having about as many players as a high pop vanilla server had way back when.
---
So if player numbers decrease, the server will just cut down on the amount of layers, so for example if there are 10 layers on a server and 90% of players leave, you still have enough people to fill one layer and as a player you won't feel any difference. 
---
Means for us a huge amount of players can leave a server and you won't have to worry about being on an empty server. Layering will get removed eventually (I think in phase 3). With free transfers incoming I'm pretty sure they'll manage to bring all servers to healthy population. 
---
(That's all how I understand it and i can not deliver sources)
---
Literally all it takes is 5 people to report you for it to automatically silence you. A person with 4 friends can easily do it.
---
Yeah and that is the problem with how easy it is to be exploited.
---
There were people in the chat channels, Trade/General/LFG laughing and bragging and trash talking people who were doing Guild recruiting.
---
Just smartass rude asshole's and there was enough of them that it worked... and I've seen it done on Twitch to a streamer as well.
---
This. You’ll get some laughs if you try to tank as fury in anything serious.

If your bs or know one, you can get a counter weight but don't enchant your whilrwind axe

I think it is more of a meme later when you get ice lance or something.

You may be able to find the video but a player litterally put it on all the hotkeys and face rolled to victory.

It's up there with the dude who played mage with a steering wheel.

Probably occured after vanilla but still humorous.
---
10 bucks says you watch sodapoppin
---
Get an auto attack timer so you can accurately predict when you’re going to wand. AFAIK there isn’t a way to cheat it using a macro. 
---
[I recommend using WeaponSwingTimer](https://github.com/LeftHandedGlove/WeaponSwingTimerAddon), as it can track your melee swings as well as your targets, hunters range attacks as well as wands. 
---
This is used by a lot of hunters and warriors.
---
Blizzard GMs? You mean an automated reporting system that’s exploitable?
---
Cool style always liked shapes and colors being enough to give a vibe

:O

then you probably haven't joined the global channels yet

I read that as "leveling their lives" at first.

Sounds like you and a few others on this thread lack empathy or just refuse to acknowledge how others may feel.

Sounds like a rough marriage and I'm sorry.  If I want to do a weekly night out with some friends, my wife is totally down for that.  She likes when I play video games too because she knows that I work a lot and if I'm playing I'm finally relaxing.

For less than 7 mobs, yes.

Gotta buy em at a demon trainer, they're nearby the warlock trainers in major cities.

What’re the odds he worked a snail into the joke and your username is C4ptainSnail

It is not a ban, it silences you and says you are unable to use chat channels or mail until a GM can review the situation.
---
And if you try to open a ticket and appeal it, you see they are swamped and the wait time is 32+ hours and no way to contact a GM or a real person.

how expensive are we talking about here?

I don't know of any add-on managers that auto update add-ons?

Yea, you. Go away.

---
Well horde have to spend what level 8-23 in Barrens no wonder they go loopy lol
---
Hey there! I'm from Wowhead and 'added in 1.13' on the Classic site simply means it was datamined in the Classic beta update, which Blizzard refers to as 1.13 in the data. We'd love if Blizzard added old patch data.
---
I've marked that item as 'added in content phase 1' which should be visible in Quick Facts, for players wondering when it's added.
---
It’s due to a couple things...
---
First, it’s a smaller community. There are no cross realm shenanigans so we see the same people over and over, especially the ones going up through the levels with us. Because of that we become more familiar and there’s a higher likelihood that the mage you just saved from an over pull might be in your next dungeon run.
---
Second, we’re in the world more and forced to interact with its population. We’re not clicking a button and immediately getting a dungeon group to go faceroll some content with, instead we have to recruit players and *gasp* be social in an online game.
---
All of this leads to an accountability of sorts and it’s one I happily see a lot of Classic players embrace.
---
Agreed, I only group for kill quests or guaranteed drop quests. But those are the only ones anyone seems to want to group for on my server anyway so it works out.
---
Yes and as we are seeing there groups of people doing it.
---
This being abused/exploited whatever and Blizzard does not have a system in place to handle the abuse and overwhelmed so people are being locked out of chat channels and the mail for a very long period of time.
---
thanks retard you do the same
---
it will be replaced in mid 40s for me, long way to go for now so i would like some sort of viability in pvp otherwise my journy gets alot more longer, unless whatever i buy is ultra expensive, then i dont mind giving it a little boost!
---
The problem with post like this is that they always fail to say what you were saying in chat.
---
These guys have no fear.
---
The mage.
---
Hell yeah im 10 bucks richer
---
Agreed. Also smite is your best dps spell as a priest, combined with wands you pretty much stay mana neutral while leveling. Not having to sit down and drink every 2-3 mobs is a huge time gain.
---
5 weapon skill isn't anywhere close to 10% extra dps,  probably more like 1% at best.
---
Diarrhea I would assume. Cuz the dude is gonna rhea as well.
---
Yes and they were in the chat channels boasting and trolling people doing it and encouraging others to do it as well.
---
Name checks out .
---
What about Lickspittle
---
Have you played any already? 
---
Congrats though! Our time is coming!
---
I'm reaching the same point with mages. They're absolute morons, they frost nova while I'm pulling mobs back because of a patrol. Every. Single. Time.
---
I love that y’all are both on Reddit. 
---
Fucking missed this about wow. ♥️
---
And remember, there's nothing wrong with an off tank. They may not be as sexy as main tanks and get the sweet solos, but they're extremely important.
---
You are like 10k players no one cares
---
One thing that annoys me is that it just shows one debuff at a time, when I often want to see several. Some mobs pad the debuffs but there's one in there deep I want to dispel.
---
True, but with the open transfer from aragul and the fact that felstriker is a newer realm I figured they may have been on another server prior
---
vendor price for just the vendor price.  auctioneer for something more robust
---
Look for a raiding guild that'll let you raid casually, there are more of them than you'd think, especially if you're not fussy about gear or being part of an alt raid team!
---
I’ve read through that twice and I’m still not entirely sure what your questions is.  People with bleeding edge gear still have to farm, repair and respec.  You don’t have to be in a raiding guild to raid, but it does make it a lot easier than trying to PUG it.
---
Shieeeeet, well I guess I'll try out retail for a while, ty
---
I'll say it here again, classic servers hold way more players than 3.5k currently. There's no real numbers by blizzard but I've read between 10-20k. That's what the layering everyone talks about is for, so it feels like 3k. It's highly unlikely a server will die out any time soon, especially if it's on high pop currently.
---
No one uses that on Pagle and not once in my time playing so far have I ever saw anyone's recruit message in that channel.
---
Most people don't even know it is there and it is empty.
---
Classic is fun because it gives you something to slowly work towards without it feeling forced or like a todo list. I'd recommend it at least just to see for yourself.
---
It’s  not fine, classic is proving that it is one of many issues that take away from the magic of the game.
---
I hope this gets the upvotes it deserves
---
World first!
---
I think 45s
---
It shipped after about 2. But they used FedEx. Perhaps the picture doesn't do it justice but it is the proper paper and looks real good.
---
Transcendence EU. Up since second day of classic launch.
---
Who could have imagined such a thing?
---
First time in vanilla, huh?
---
Yeah it is 1000, but once you buy it you have it. It is not an item you learn and then cast as a spell, it is an item that stays in your bags.
---
The cheapest epic mounts are the AV mounts.
---
Looks similar to what an addon called Carbonite did back in the day
---
yOu gO bUrNiNg sTePpEs?
---
There are many addons that can be setup to alert you when a buff fades, such as WeakAuras.
---
Yeah I report guild spammers it's annoying to see them post every 2 minutes. PvP I have not seen.
---
Probably should have mentioned the server
---
Hahahaha.   You must be a good friend.   Only the best of friends will ask for a whole server to gank a friend.
---
This is me. I felt really bad for letting you die. I was farming for my mount and a work instant message came in and the mobs got out of control while I alt-tabbed.
---
Thanks for the post. It made my day :)
---
What add-on shows the AH prices like that?
---
Altrec valley
---
Give us his name
---
Probably should mention what server you’re on.
---
With the pummler, feral has the highest single target threat generation for all the vanilla.
---
Shimmering flats is a weird zone rn, I was so surprised to see everyone peacefully doing their thing for several minutes before the inevitable fights broke out!
---
Ehhh everyone in vanilla had fire res which is 99% useless for the raid but back then strats weren’t so widely available and guilds often didn’t discuss their strats. The guilds that first week rag were rag tag in terms of gear because chances are most of the toons below 60 most likely didn’t have the required hit. What most people fail to realize is a lot of these guilds have done nothing but play vanilla wow for the last 5 years. Prime example Apes, they’ve played on every major vanilla server. Do it enough and you can do it with your eyes closed.
---
During that period you have to be always looking for a new weapon because when the old one gets weak you’re quickly back to bandage or food after one yellow mob. Staying a level such that you have green quests during these lulls is essential.
---
You know 2/10,000 is 1/5000 right.
---
What's glhf?
---
Please no. Just create a new character
---
Aoe mages stacking spellpower, should tell you enough about them to blacklist for life
---
Basically, I just don't want to level warrior only to get to 60 and be stuck not being able to do anything because I suck at farming, can't join a raiding guild because rl and can't pvp.
---
Hi, just as a query, how have you set up the turning is done with wasd or do you have it with touch turning?
---
Disappointed no one went for mookake
---
Good. Many of us are sick of you absolute spamming shitters destroying the trade and general chats with your extremely annoying lfg/gold selling/boosting crap and guild recruitment spam.
---
There are explicit channels for LFG and Guild recruitment.
---
Trade and General chat channels are not your personal spamming playground.
---
Trade and general chat (Horde) are unusable on NoggenFogger EU because of the poxy spammers so a lot of us are fighting back and reporting the spammers to silence them.
---
We asked nicely, we told you there were specific channels for lfg and guild recruitment but you shitters ignored the vast majority in the community and continue your spam so feck it, enjoy getting reported and silenced in the meantime.
---
This is not retail, the community in classic rejects your shitter spam.
---
Globalignore addon is also available for classic and it is a godsend to filtering all your shitter spam out of the chat channels.
---
STOP SPAMMING LFG AND GUILD RECRUITMENT IN TRADE AND GENERAL CHAT!
---
Barrens is particularly bad. It's a funnelling point for most Horde characters from 12-30, and when 50% of players get in one place...
---
Never thought of Keanu as the replacement Norris because he is just cooler but that makes sense.
---
I have enjoyed questing over dungeons. I just end up in groups for long periods of time with random people. It’s pretty enjoyable.

He’s trying to MC, not kill.  He has no choice but to hard cast (and fail).
---
Barrens chat is weirder than most... But people are usually nice if you talk to them directly. /1 is full of memes, dumb jokes, and general fuckery.
---
Woman here too, used to play back during burning crusade and wrath. My advice is to take the general chats with a big grain of salt, but be quick to block anyone who acts like a dingbat towards you personally.
---
The orgional joke was turning a K-car into an S-car, but nobody today remembers what the K-car was lol.

That is a 200 IQ move right there
---
Yeah my friend got this as well as a 2H epic sword level 39. Lucky mofo
---
Goddamn
---
Rag is way better for pally because the effect can proc vengeance. Pretty sure it's BiS for paladin until might of menethil in Naxx, just because that weapon is insane.
---
Did you?
---
I was in a very similar boat to you. I have only gone up to level twenty, and that was back around wraith of the lich king. When the game came out I decided I would go for it with my cousin who is big into wow.
---
The first few days he leveled right beside me and helped show me the ropes, it's pretty common for players to level together at lower levels, so this isn't a huge and insane thing to ask like I thought it would be.
---
I found that I picked the game up really quick. There's still things to learn of course, but it's that way for everyone, even vets. You'll be to the point where you're helping people with stuff they don't know about in less than a week.
---
You can get add-ons to make the game as easy or difficult in whatever aspects you would like. Get questlime if you want to not worry about finding quests for a while.
---
Darkshore is impressive. It doesn't even have that many people.
---
Which addon is it that show vendor prices?
---
I always throw out a renew and stam buff
---
Cool!! I love my set up on retail but I'm waiting for the nostalgia to wear off before I set up Elvui for classic.
---
Exactly
---
Thanks man. It's fitting because I'm a tank.
---
That's why I asked lol.
---
There used to be "modifier" macros but its been so long
---
/cast nomodifier heal rank 3
---
/cast modifier:alt heal 1
---
/cast modifier:ctrl lesser heal
---
/cast modifier:shift heal rank 2
---
Could give this a try
---
Better hope youre not lvl 22-39:)
---
Ask not with whom the Nightfall is carried.  It is carried by you.
---
Tip as a druid pre hot yourself before shifting into bear/cat and starting combat. This usually allows you to take on up to 2-3 mobs at a time. 
---
Also if tightly clustered, Entangling roots and Hibernate are your friends. 
---
Questing through the Barrens earlier I was able to clear out the entire raptor camp for Stolen Silver this way with no issue. Roots one Raptor, Regrowth/rejuvenation and then bear form the other 2.
---
Boo this man, boooooo
---
Seriously, there’s a road sign near my house that says 2/8 mile and it drives me fucking crazy
---
This is so cool! Sounds great!
---
As a newly aspiring mage. Healers get a free stack and anybody else can pay about 1/8th the price it would cost to buy it from a vendor. Otherwise for lvl 35 water you can go hearth to an inn and pay 80s a stack
---
Everything I’ve read (I’m leveling a warrior) says that
---
Competent Warrior &gt; Overgeared Warrior
---
Your "sheesh" implied it. Don't toss hands and then back down and act like you don't know what he's talking about just cause he called you out.
---
Jokes on him, paladins dont have any skills worth training either
---
Bruh, its still hard killing magni. Harder than rag and Onyxia tbh
---
Lol great contribution. You seem like an intelligent person. Have an upvote since your ego is fragile enough to be damaged by a stranger's gameplay style of a 14 year old game. Stay positive.
---
&gt;substantialy
---
That's the kind of dramatization I'm talking about. There is not such a big difference.
---
Go read the details for the free character transfers
---
Thanks, Nevermind. But is there something equal to twich  in the sense of showing me updates for addons i have installed?
---
Grab your spray paint Boys! We have a evil to smite!
---
Everything that isn't strength is great, and as long as you're specced BM while leveling then gear doesn't matter enough to care about.
---
If alliance then go to wetlamds at L25 for Raptor's End, and either faction there's the STV quest chain for a good bow. Outside of that really don't stress about gear too much until you're nearing 60 imho.
---
He didn't imply that.  He was staying that the camper will get bored and leave while he is playing another character.  :)
---
Sorry but me Guild recruiting every 15min or 30min or 1hr is in no way spamming.
---
And on Pagle are channels are clean and very good with no gold sellers or boosting etc...
---
You just sold me on playing again!
---
Congrats
---
Obviously because you can only see players from other realms and can't give them gold
---
Multiboxing.. smh
---
Do 80-90% of rogues? No.
---
Should they? Yes
---
In vanilla the top tier of pve or pvp rogues yes it was very important if you had enough skill to
---
They're in a safe zone. Couldn't kill them unless they pvp flag
---
Weird that they dont use class colors and just borrow Paladin pink lol maybe the writer was a horde hater

Can anyone tell me why everyone plays warriors? I was expecting them to be super rare but they seem to be the 2nd most played after mages.
---
Leveling one is torture and I always thought people who are willing to tank are pretty rare. Just hope all those warris don't want to play dps later
---
For dungeons? Fuck no! Just bring a shield and a 1-hander and you'll be fine until the 50s.
---
Same thing apart from I now have a priest lv22
---
This is why you roll alliance, so you have good-guy paladins to bubble you.
---
Actually, yes
---
Love bigg booty bitches
---
I'm almost level 20!! :D
---
Which chest armor is that?
---
30
---
We are Alliance, :) Ret is a meme spec afterall, but yea its not good for either class to be fair.
---
A few weeks ago on this sub you never would have known anyone had that opinion.  It was warrior or don’t bother.  Its nice to see the chicken little’s realizing some of the claims of viability aren’t going to apply to the easiest raid content, if at all.
---
It’s always a good idea to try and AH all white items and greens before vendor. Same with cloth and stuff. I just made a level 1 bank alt and mail all of my stuff to him.  The quest pages from STV and Ashenvale sell too. I bought my mount at 40 and I’m back up to 50g at level 44. Only vendor as a last resort. Get an AH addon, it will make it very easy.
---
Inner fire, shield, mind blast shadow word pain psychic scream mindflay, then flip between mind blast and wand depending on mana. Try to buff shield as soon as you think youl be attacked so you can reshield mid fight. 
---
mind blast does a lot of damage if its up to date.
---
If you know your gonna be able to do it, save psychic scream for when your about half health then reshield and flash heal. Nothing more demoralising then having your attacks absorbed while they full heal. 
---
Your still gonna lose to things like rogue and warrior so try group up with other people if your in a pvp hot-spot like hillsbard yeti cave
---
I feel like an old man yelling at kids to get off my lawn with all the damn reporting I've been doing
---
Exactly, I guess I'll just continue playing on my Orc and hit level 60 and hopefully they release it later, then I'll swap to tauren.
---
I was at a party tonight legit thought about how I could be leaving right now
---
wowhead maybe?
---
No, go back to retail...wait
---
Goldshire on RP sever be like...
---
I farmed a lot in hillsbrad foothills, arathi highlands, and STV.
---
No memes. 
---
Had you done it with anyone that isn’t supposed to be a tank or offtank... then yeah. Meme time.
---
Try it again with a warlocks demon.
---
Dude the same people bad mouthing you are the ignorant pos's that would report you.  I get your point that what you did was harmless and didn't warrant a report.  
---
I have went in general and asked a simple answer and got ignorant replies.   Just the toxic attitudes.
---
Let's take action and begin the report all a'holes campaign.   :)
---
finish vanilla phases, start new timeline keeping classic feel.
---
If you’re looking for a game that doesn’t take time to progress, I’d say stick to retail. Yes there are add ons that will speed up some aspects of the game but even with them, it’s going to be a much longer grind than anything in retail. I’m one of the jerks who thinks add ons like questie can ruin the classic experience, but I would never tell someone how to play a game. Do what you want to do and have fun!
---
He didn't have a good start so he's just entering barrens
---
Managed to use a friends account and realised I didn’t need to buy the game just download it and it works! Put everything to low and killed a few mobs in barrens then went to orgrimmar AH and there were no issues!
---
Good luck have fun
---
Those mages were on some shit if they just spammed blizzard instead of a macro with fireblast in it.
---
Because 2h Warriors are generally levelling as Arms which has a bunch of things based on your weapon damage independent of attack speed such as Overpower, Deep Wounds and Mortal Strike. Slower 2hs also make stronger use of the limited 5 attacks from Sweeping Strikes talent skill.
---
Examples?
---
Yes please I need this in my office!
---
DPS - damage per second
---
HPS -  healing per second
---
TPS - threat per second or Total Performance Sports, Boston’s number one strongman and powerlifting gym.
---
Swap to broken tooth layer spam would be much faster.
---
At least you guys have stealth and heals /:
---
Dude I got saved by a 40 something paladin in ashenvale. Was getting ganked left and right by horde and he swoops in smites all the horde, resses me amd says "fuck the horde, king's honor brother" and rides off.  Are their fleets of paladins that roam everywhere helping their brethren?
---
It's a thing in the Barrens because so many players end up there. All horde races are basically forced to quest in Barrens for a while, and it supports levels 12 up to late 20s. So when you have that many people in one zone, the vocal minority just seem a lot louder than in other zones.
---
Wondering if anyone had a bet with 1$ on the line.
---
Decent idea.
---
It's 2019, not 1990, you should find some new material.
---
Yikes.
---
Not wrong but you know why I know pserver player love racial slurs... b.c I have played on many it's kinda what they do.
---
Why do people call them enchant shamans, it’s enhance. Unless you are the kind of people that just want to see the world burn and spell rogue as “rouge” to troll
---
Priests, pillars of community.
---
I'd suggest some mouse over macros and your preferred frames. I raised retail in a mythic prog guild using just mouseover macros and the default frames. Never breaks on patch day. I find elvui and some other frame mods prettier than the default, but they can be fussy.
---
Maybe it's easier because instead of being 15 you're 30.
---
There's a major difference between a barber only for hair/beard and group finder / dungeon standardisation etc. The former adds immersion and role play elements. The later removes immersion and role play elements.
---
Also touchers of children....
---
I do this but lower key since I'm 29, just running up to lowbies and handing them shit, money, bags, whatever and sending a &lt;3 and walking away is great. Hopefully the community tries to foster the camaraderie as we move forward
---
Guess what's throwing me off is that I can at least raid as Feral Druid if I learn how to powershift while Ele shamans would never be viable but focused for healing mostly. Not that I mind healing once in a while but I like to DPS once in a while too.
---
Moo.
---
As long as you have 5 in wand and 5 in spirit tap you are fine
---
2h fury is really fun when you get the crits rolling. Not so much when you have 15 seconds with no crit
---
Nice! Thanks. I think I will try it out next weekend then :)
---
you can always ask for help you know
---
it feels like psychic scream never gives me the opportunity to do anything though. I just got into a 2 on 1, they both started low health, I psychic screamed both of them and the preist broke out of it and psychic screamed me in under 2 seconds. and Im horde so its not WOTF
---
Yeah, it's been a long time.
---
I remember it being a bit finicky at times, but it was mostly reliable. Saved my ass a bunch, but ultimately made me lazy!
---
CTRL-S
---
Hardcore vanilla wow fans are very stubborn , fortunately people like shedo have put in the necessary effort in. Most acceptance was forced by tank shortages "some warriors refuse to tank"
---
I whipped mine out when questie and wowhead came up empty handed on a few quests, just a boomer would.
---
Like to go get some popcorn and a stick if it gets slow, right?
---
This is some 9gag tier boomer shit, nice
---
Tired, bad opinions.  Why not be better? If you think shit like balance druid or hunter scaling is better left alone lose my number lol
---
Shadowmeld mind controll is fun though
---
BiS until ashbringer but yeah, it’s even better than axe off C’thun
---
Why a warrior would choose to solo level is beyond me.
---
The default party raid frames are more than fine for healing anything from a party to 40 man raid.
---
The ones from retail are in classic, not the old raid interface.
---
I came to ask the same question.  Clean ui
---
This train need a 4th wheel?
---
What y'all know about the 4-strokes Gang? Gang gang.
---
I mean if you want to hold onto something based on what you suspect it might be worth in 6+ months, be my guest lmao
---
I'm a very experienced tank, like close to 8 years straight of current tanking and the disparity between these two groups is mind boggling. I was running Cath basically all day yesterday and groups fell into one of two main camps. I could either pull virtually nonstop and act like it was M+ or I'd have to sit there with my thumb up my ass for 30 seconds after every pull as the healer would go oom. The crazy thing is I'd have like a baller druid who's 35 in my M+ like groups and then I'd have a 39 druid in the next group who has to drink after every pull. The only explanation I can come up with is there are a large portion of people who have no idea what down ranking is.     
---
     
---
Now don't even get me started on the healers who flip shit when I pull when they're at 70% mana. Bro, we don't need to sit every god damn pull. Hell, just sit there and drink , i can handle tanking for a bit without heals.
---
I mean it completely butchers the joke there was literally no other way to interpret his comment than as sarcasm already.
---
You must play EvE
---
10 g???? Fuckin big baller
---
Ah another fellow dwarf. Thanks for reminding me of home! I miss this place.
---
Holy shit shit you’re dumb. No one is ‘demanding’ anything and because you clearly can’t formulate any of your own conclusions or thoughts, paid transfers would serve the exact same purpose they do in retail: to allow players to change realms for any reason they want. I’ll let you practice your critical thinking skills to come up with some examples
---
sucks lol
---
Really don't think they will. The economy of classic is not the same as it was in vanilla.
---
This is what I’m doing with all of my friends who never played WoW at all. In classic, I’m level 32 with like 4 days and a few hours played. I’ve spent so much time helping them learn their classes and doing “harder” quests. I don’t see myself getting at mount at 40 cause I’ve been blowing through my gold/resources to get them bags and greens from the Ah. But at the end of the day, it’s been worth it. They’ve all become addicted to playing so I think my job is done. Now, it’s time to teach them dungeons. 
---
That said, if you play alliance on old blanchy, our guild of newbs would love to have you.
---
Contrary to popular belief, all shaman weapon enchants do about the same damage, and also don't really depend on weaponspeed. Picking whatever you most recently learned will probably be the best option for leveling.
---
Tauren are so dope. I am thinking about dual-boxing a warrior and a shaman after I cap my priest. The 15 year old version of the game has rekindled my crippling MMO addiction. Thanks Blizzard.
---
It is without a bubble.  It has 1 hp.
---
Don't like classic play retail don't like retail play Classic easy idk why people gotta make such big deal and post about it.
---
YOU WHAT?
---
It's the same edgelords that post on 4chan. Bunch of losers thinking that acting edgy will make people think they are cool.
---
name checks out
---
Shit, I can't believe the amount of time you guys put into the game, I've not even downloaded the game yet.
---
I've found RedtuzkUI even more clean
---
Some people have been playing 10-18hs a day since release just grinding quests and dungeons. I admire them. Meanwhile me; get lost on Undercity half of the 3 or 4 hours I play a day.
---
Total point score,  druid have a higher potential gear score when geared from raids.
---
A /stop saying macro help but wand are finicky.
---
Depression combined with no job
---
I had a melee hunter beyblading in a group with ravager last night. It was kind of comical.
---
Well.. they say the lovey dovey phase can last easily for a year or two. I hear the trick is to be able to “love” each other without the “love feeling” (i might be talking out of my ass here)
---
Hello, im looking for 2 addons that can do the following:
---
1. if i type a coordinates in it, it will put a marker on  the map and preferably on minimap as well
---
2. and one that shows what will be the result of disenchanting items
---
Doyou know any addons that can help me with these? TY&lt;3
---
You lied you didn't screenshot at all.
---
You Came up with it in guild chat? Not someone else’s post from 11 minutes ago?
---
Some prefer at 40 others at 45
---
No. You don't need lower ranks to train higher ones.
---
Whoopsie doodle! I dropped my monster condombulator that I use for my magnum dongleflange!
---
Consider the both holy and discipline where viable in endgame. It's just a different way of healing (one by preventing damage, the other by healing)
---
Yeah I tried this as a gag on my friend who almost missed the boat to BB. Duel starts, I fear him and start to cast MC but he legit just clipped under the stairs into the bottom of the boat.
---
An ancient manuscript from another age becomes useful once more!
---
I'm horde on this server. Pray for me.
---
Yeah alliance gets split across 3 different zones from 10-20, Horde has one zone where 3/4ths of their player base is funneled.  And even then a lot of undead come over to do the barrens as well since that's where wailing caverns is.
---
Np, ill camp you and all the hordes on my human rogue.
---
"I swear, the first one of you who says 'quivering' is getting kicked."
---
Yeah the Truefaith Vestments.
---
&gt; he has the personality of a 45 year old father trying to use a computer for the first time.
---
I doubt i'd watch him if i just randomly came across him on twitch but as an older game who's been around WOW as long as he has i enjoy watching him.
---
Thats awesome. Wow Classic community is so much better than retail. I love it
---
Tell us how druid tanks are light years behind warriors. We are listening.
---
0 x 0,01 = 0
---
Shield Wall isn't what does it, Shield Block is.
---
Shield Block is beyond stupid as you're entirely crit and crushing immune granted you don't take more than 2 swings in a 5 second window, which never happens on a hard hitting boss really. the 100% block pushes crits and crushes off the table.
---
This is why Warriors are the godlike main tanks, Take Twins for instance and their unbalancing strike reducing defense skill by 100, you'd be crit and crushed to high heavens as a druid for instance, but shield block keeps you safe.
---
Druids are a lot better at soaking ability/spell damage, physical big daddy bosses is warrior all the way.
---
That's weird, every single addon I've seen across several characters still uses the blue from tbc and later. Wonder why only this one uses the accurate color lol
---
Same! I know they put a lot of work into it... but it is too big and confusing. 
---
Classic is a very engaging and simple. Van Cleef and his Stonemasons got angry at the King for not paying them what they deserve when they rebuilt Stormwind so now they've created a rebel group and hide out in the Deadmines. Easy, simple, and engaging.
---
Except that doesn’t get split since it’s an item.
---
I'm level 33 and still haven't seen the 10G mark. This game is fickle!
---
I like rezzing random people out in the wild, lol. Haven't earned any cash from it yet but I like to think I'm getting an incredibly small amount of good karma
---
You are right - kitty form should always speak lolcat :)
---
Now I’m trying to remember our dear leader from 14 years ago.  CAT IS 4 FITE
---
*spams sacrifice as soon as HP drops below 10%*
---
(Although if they survive they deserve a heal)
---
I disagree entirely since they could have actually felt bad about it. The thing about sarcasm is that it's a phrase said in the opposite connotation that you would think it should be. So somebody saying ,"oh come on guys, you know I hate dead baby jokes." Could be a legitimate thing to say because most people probably don't like dead baby jokes, however the way I would have meant it would be that I actually do like dead baby jokes and everybody knows that but I'm pretending to not like them for the sake of a laugh.
---
So, given that's how sarcasm works, it makes sense that there should be a textual way to represent sarcasm since when told verbally there is a certain tone people usually take when saying the sarcastic statement.
---
Therefore you can shove it up your ass, adding a /s to the end of your statement is no different than putting an overly sarcastic tone on a sarcastic statement vocally.
---
Stupid and lazy because you think so? I never said that you should be able to change class, I said you should be able to change race. Don't put words in my mouth.
---
UC is not easy to navigate... atleast not to me
---
For the horde 1337
---
FYI you can play wow on almost any laptop, even if it has integrated gpu, so don't worry about spending a lot
---
Shield Block really does make all the difference for a number of fights simply because of how it nullifies crushings and crits.
---
Wouldn’t heal him.
---
If he Snipes you... How could it be anything you've seen coming??
---
Oh, Okay...
---
Well the next time I see a commercial advertising a remedy for either will be the first.
---
[Doctor Recommended ](https://youtu.be/_8PeRoAIeJ0)
---
Generally, Renew is a waste of a healing spell anyway given its tendency to overheal, Power Word Shield is your friend levelling. My rotation at least is Mind blast (chain sw pain at end of cast) - power word shield - mind flay/wand till dead, throw in another mind blast if you're feeling naughty
---
Does alliance not have their own crude are chat?
---
No this is dumb. Youre missing the point if this is true and youre above level 20.
---
I have the nostalgia and let me tell you, it's so much better this time around.
---
Hah nice!
---
Mine is called Pawnstar
---
allie
---
I know it’s very valuable for horde players if you put it on the neutral AH b/c they can’t buy it.
---
Pretty sure OP is escargot.
---
It's not about being the best. It's literally about smacking someone with sulfuras.
---
omg - perfect!
---
Many people rebind strafe to a and d, feeding up q and e for ability binds
---
I can see how some people wouldn't like him but as someone who use to watch Swifty videos in vanilla and who's around the same age as Swifty i get him.
---
Of course, it's always killing alliance, whatever the cost.
---
R/unexpectedly-heavy
---
I'm not sure if you've missed the fact that classic runs in the modern client will all the graphical improvements that entails.
---
It's not a screenshot though.
---
What? He saved all those hostages as a ghost?
---
If you do get a cat make sure to get both bite and claw
---
Twins is another and Patchwerk but there are a fair few (though you deffo want a druid soaking hatefuls)
---
Any boss with massive physical damage is all about the warriors because Shield Block nullifies crits and crushes, druids are preferable on heavy spell damage/abiltiy fights because of the higher health pool and higher threat (barring select few weapons for the warrior).
---
I always give a heathstone to a war in need
---
This makes me sick. I'm a lvl 51 mage. Each time I do an elite quest or a dungeon I conjure an entire stack of water for each mana-user in the group. For free ofc! That’s why I rolled mage, for its out-of-combat utility.
---
How many layers did you jump to find an alliance player?
---
There is always a guy that didn't notice we are not in /r/vanillawow
---
Whenever i mouse over a spell the pop-up with the spell information is in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. Is there anyway to make this pop-up where the mouse actually is? Or like right above the spell?
---
Yeah it’s a minuscule amount less dps because sometimes the first crit doesn’t give you frenzy, but it’s super close and the longer the fight the closer it is
---
Every server is different and every day is different depending on who is flooding the AH or who has tons of gold and is buying everything in site.
---
That being said don't vendor trash ANYTHING from skinning or mining, you'll always make more (2-3x) on the AH
---
If you haven’t got them yet, get Auctionator and Vendor Price or something similar.
---
Go to Auction first and use the addons Sell tab, this will scan the AH for all other listings and give you the price, you can then compare the vendor price to AH price within your bags.
---
Note that you need to consider listing costs as part of AH sells. Some items sell a bit above vendor price, but you end up paying out for enough in listing costs to lose any benefit and you have the risk of the listing falling through and having to relist.
---
Depending on your server economy, charms (used in the Warrior whirlwind axe quest) that drop off elementals in Arathi have been going for 1-2g each on my server. They drop maybe 1 in 5 elementals.
---
Nope - they often (although not always) aggro on anyone and everyone they run past.
---
They only reset if they're at the far end of their pathing range.
---
Do you generally just ask in chat, or do you personally whisper people? I have found much more success whispering directly. Still might take a good 10+ whispers if you're unlucky, but that's been my go-to.
---
It’s simple economic principles. The supply of money is strictly what has been looted by mobs in the past 2 weeks. As more mobs are killed the amount of money in the world will increase.
---
Ducks fly together. For the Horde!
---
That made no sense in the first place, as they could have killed random mobs until outleveling those quests in th time it took to get halfway up the queue.
---
iM GoNnA ScReEnShOt ThIs AnD pOsT iT oN ReDdIt
---
I found that it doesn't work together.
---
Also if you uninstall Omni and your party frames and stuff disappeared DM me I can give you commands to fix it
---
Yeah, basically it shows your threat on the enemy’s floating HP bar 
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/threat-plates-classic
---
And no offence but I am so over everyone getting hung up on this.
---
People are letting this RUIN THEIR GAME when there are at least 1000,000,000,000 other incredible things about this.
---
No it’s not the same. I’m also 15 or so years older, have a computer thirty times more powerful, graphics turned way passed classics maximum, a stable income and sleep routine. It is different in so many ways and focusing on those parts is a waste of energy which could be spent enjoying what IS.
---
/end rant
---
This guy has it right! I would absolutely get 5/5 corruption in affliction first then move to demonology get your 5/5 stamina then 3/3 voidwalker then go back to affliction and for me I put 3/5 into the spell resist then 2/2 life tap and now I am working on putting the next talents in curse of agony. All you need to do is corruption, CoA on the target then wand it down. You can put immolate on them also but it’s not necessary.
---
r/woooosh
---
Polish Jewish people and nazis??? Bitch what the fuck are you talking about? Shut up lol.
---
Man i wanna roll an enhance but i also wanna raid.
---
BasicComboPoints
---
Damn that’s really well done, great job! Thanks for that
---
I think twink weapons are a bit different. They'll skyrocket in value once a lot of players hit 60 and start getting disposable income. But a leveling epic like this won't go up in value nearly as much.
---
For five movies??
---
I was level 42-43 when looking for groups. Finally my friends caught up to the lower end of the bracket and we could run it through
---
3 sec?
---
Hunter is rough until you get your post at 10 but from then on its a very strong leveler.
---
Hope you're joking. The game doesn't start at 60, it starts at 1.
---
My realm!
---
People severely under estimate the armor bonus
---
tell furi he's a lil bitch and to come fight me
---
This is what I like about Paladin it's pretty much the definition of a support class.
---
A paladin by itself doesn't accomplish much of anything, but when in a group they're suddenly a huge roleplayer, I love that. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea and most people want to be the star of the show, but I really like the plethora of support options Paladin has at its disposal.
---
7d21h is a good time for a first timer.. I think my original lv 60 in 2005-6 had 19d something played to lv 60 lol
---
I think the best part of this is the turn away in the last frame.  Like “my work is done.”
---
GIVE ME ALL THE DOWNVOTES. I AM NOURISHED BY YOUR HATRED.
---
No it won't, a higher level would come and kill you. People that like playing twinks only want easy fights.
---
Does sweeping strikes and whirlwind synergize?
---
I beat my meat on this back in vanilla to be honest
---
“More dots” a sentence you can’t say in this case
---
Lol you seem very angry over a chat.
---
Wait, people twink at levels other than 19?
---
Mage vs warrior can make anyone look like a pve scrub
---
Valtra is a man of culture
---
That's classic, the higher level you get the more tools you unlock for your class.
---
It takes people a while to get it to work while strafing if thats whats messing you up
---
its just a joke from south park
---
UC takes some learning.
---
Have you tried using your abilities?
---
Rogues: when do you use expose armor? I’ve heard conflicting sentiments ranging from never to situational at best. I know it doesn’t stack with sunder so I’ll never use it with a warrior, but what about pvp or pve? Also, is it best to use on high or low armor targets?
---
For tanking Taladril’s is even a bigger reference, Sheri being a dps kitty mainly
---
Uhm, you’re assuming both parties are willing to work on things. One person can try all they want, but if your partner isn’t making the same effort as you you’re better off separating. Children feel that tension and strife and internalize it.
---
Co-parenting isn’t the end of the world.
---
\#protip
---
Oh shit maybe that’s where my dad went after getting cigarettes
---
And this is why there is always 55/45 Horde:Alliance
---
That shouldn’t be happening as a Paladin. You are very survivable. Are you pulling too many mobs at once? Have you got some decent mail armour and a 2 hand mace? Are your spells up to date? You should be pulling one or two mobs at a time, whacking them with a 2 handed hammer with SoR and judging, and healing yourself with Holy Light if you drop below half health
---
Hunter
---
You can do each dungeon once for the quests in there, they usually yield decent gear. I wouldn't recommend spamming dungeons unless you really enjoy that.
---
Quick math, "Double as hard"...
---
As a hunter it isn’t a goal. If he tries another class, then one can speak of success. Except AoE farming mages and dungeon grinding.
---
You will hate life trying to level as prot.  You can tank dungeons fine as either fury/arms, just slap on a 1h and shield.
---
It’s just crazy to me how people can be so petty over such a small thing. Don’t even care about the downvotes, at this point I’m gonna go out of my way to post monitor pics.
---
well the joke is that i'm poor not that my wife is mean
---
You will be able to tank everything while being arms or fury so don't worry about going prot till later on as a 60. You will have a hard time questing as prot as well.
---
Grata man, my eyes went straight to that girdle too. Happy Furying lol
---
Plenty aware, been building my own PC for over 2 decades...shit I feel old...i just want get something with better than integrated graphics becauaw I will inevitably play something else on it. Still looking at sub-1k for a G3.
---
Are you buying new skills?
---
Haha indeed, Big to get it this early. TY !
---
to be honest i wasn't expecting legitimate discourse on failing marriages in this thread, this was just a dumb joke i thought up i'm not even married
---
Wut. You are playing the most survivable class in the game, if you're feral.
---
Your armor has nipples. And here I was, wondering how adult armors feed their young.
---
Dual wield has the higher theoretical DPS. But 1-handers are in very high demand while 2-handers are barely wanted. You might want to pick Up whatever is accesible at the time.
---
Mage you can have no arms and still be successful
---
Well then, you are lost!
---
I recommend googling "classic wow warrior talents for leveling"
---
Arms and fury are both good
---
You can tank while leveling as anything
---
Focus on one tree for now
---
Remember, you're playing with a lot of actual children, adolescents and immature adults. You can't fault their logic if they weren't employing it.
---
Okay but it’s not the fucking Mona Lisa lmao. I’m not submitting it as art. You can read the quest text, right? It was a funny quest. Read it an move on. Jesus Christ reddit can be so fucking petty lmfao.
---
I want to believe, but there's that cynical, skeptical voice. Damn you, lack of faith in humanity!

In all its glory...   Btw natural tits ftw.  Open sites tag them a saggy.

You know you can just kill the guys who camp your body, right?
---
&gt;How do you get to lvl 16 and still don't know that you shouldn't do that?
---
&gt;No way he was going to live without my help, so I helped him.

I mean...

:)
---
Saved a warrior‘s ass yesterday, felt great!
---
youre playing classic for the wrong reasons. i dont mean this as an insult but retail would actually be better for you.
---
Use common sense and open your map. Guards will mark it if you ask them where something is.
---
What a gentleman
---
Do this many people not have jobs?
---
Don't know if there's another proper one sadly... Did you try manually adding the directory?
---
Where do you play? I wouldn't mind answering questions as you come across them.
---
lol kids got the big mad
---
It's not classic until someone leaves the group in the middle of BFD and you have to find a replacement with a /who Ashenvale and a few whispers because you are in BFD general chat.
---
I did. Somehow some extra mobs got pulled and the dude died, dunno what happened.
---
I helped a low level he sent me a letter, some gold, one epic, invited me to his house, allowed me to fuck his wife, and gave me his car and some cash. Nice guy.

How do you set up bindings for gaming mouse? Using the wow cataclysm one. I can't bind over button 5.
---
Alright I was in a huge argument yesterday about this because nobody could give me a clear answer.
---
Here is what I've found that solves this. Play by play
---
Target mob
---
Apply de buffs ect
---
Click Shoot ( wand )
---
Pew pew pew
---
Time to use spell without cooldowns 
---
Tap one key to move your character, ONCE
---
That will cancel the want immediately so you can cast withou interrupted casts.  This isn't a typical rotation just an example.  
---
Then re-tap shoot to begin shooting again.   It's a pain to have to do this but it makes sense after killing a few mobs.
---
Also one more thing.  After hitting a direction key to move so the wand cancels you will still have to wait until the last animation of shooting finishes to cast a spell uninterrupted.  
---
And if you get the timing down you can cast without canceling shoot by having really good timing.
---
If you need better examples hit me up as this frustrated me for about an hour.  Now it feels natural
---
Only if you have a prot warrior to pick from. What about pugs? You could probably get away with a Feral main tank and a Feral off-tank if you had to.
---
One escort is pricey enough I couldn’t pay for 2 at the same time! Wait, what are we talking about?
---
I have 50 mace skill, yet 25% of my attacks wiff, I've got 30% armor damage resist. I'm using a green mace from the yeti quest in dun morogh
---
Only way you got from 35 to 39 doing SM is by farming it, your choice.
---
Yay =)
---
what
---
Elwynn or Westfall I'd say
---
Does anyone know if demo roar (for Druid tanks) also works similarly?
---
Keep going with your meme specs. Once my priest gets benediction/anathema I'm dropping holy/disc and going full shadow. And I plan to make my hunter alt a surv/BM melee hunter. 
---
Long live the meme specs!
---
17- pound Catfish. 
---
How rare are these?
---
I don't think I'd call this interation RP.
---
There are Floating Wreckages along the southern coasts of STV. They drop 2-3 Mithril Bound Crates when you fish from them the crates contain higher level cloth, leather, some coins and the odd BoE Green or higher item.
---
The Green items are levels 36-45 and vendor for at least 1g or sell for more.

Best part about classic is you don’t even have to deal with him yourself. He acts like that forever and he’ll be blacklisted pretty quick.
---
World of Dadcraft
---
At low levels it's brutal. Once I get cat form it'll be good, bear is getting better with every level too. Just got to get past the suck then it'll be good.
---
My recommendation is leveling to around lvl40 as fury but playing with 2h. Tons of good talents no matter what weapon you use, like 5% crit chance and 40% chance for extra rage. Here's what I'm currently using  [https://imgur.com/336fzdA](https://imgur.com/336fzdA)
---
Honestly its a solid investment, you'll make plenty of money skinning
---
You can get some quests at level 10.
---
All the respect in the world to OSRS but I genuinely hope Blizzard does not go that route.
---
I think you responded to the wrong guy. I know the Undercity like the back of my Chang.
---
Omni + classic auras is a great suggestions. Way better than some of the complicated options.
---
And I did just find another addon that does this, called CCC.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
6 figure job and a great wife with a great group of friends here who enjoy my hobby.  If that's depression and no job then call me miles davis.
---
You better join the layering hoppers to stock up arcane crystals before it's canceled in phase 2!
---
Helmets at lv10? Hah!
---
This has happened to me a few times. I always throw a heal and a shield on the guy, or a dot on the enemy when I see this happening. Last night in a drop loot quest where multiple people were trying to get the kills, and none were spwning actually helped me out though. I was in the wrong spot. 6 elites spawned right on me and my normal moves I do, do some aoe, so of course i accidentally hit them all. The passersby could have let me die so they could get the kills and loot actually helped me out though. Classic community is pretty awesome most of the time.
---
&gt; I don’t have print scrn on my keyboard
---
I highly doubt that.
---
I think 39 twinks would pay a lot for this
---
Rotation is: shield&gt;mind blast&gt;sw pain&gt;mind flay&gt;wand
---
Walk backwards from mob between mind blast and mind flay to create more distance
---
Yeah it wasn’t RP but I mean more of just talking in /say rather. I’m more willing to chat with others and screw around when I have downtime on the boat.
---
Wow, everyone on this sub seem to meet amazing people, so far i've experienced:
---
&gt;people dont help you when you get ganked by mobs or overextended, they just walk past
---
&gt;everyone leaves party immediately after they are done with the quest
---
&gt;no one sends friend/guild requests
---
&gt;SM grind spam in lfg
---
People ITT are kind of assuming people know the difference between the DS and BS threat mechanics. IIRC the way it works is that DS generates a set amount of aggro on each mob affected by the debuff. That means the higher number of mobs you gather, the more threat you're essentially producing (though still not any more \*per\* mob). On the other hand the BS threat a set amount of threat per party member affected by the buff, divided between the mobs you're in combat with. In this case, if we assume you always hit 5 party members, you're always generating the same amount of total threat, and the more mobs you are in combat with the less threat you gain on each mob.
---
The thing I'm least sure of: I believe it's once you're in combat with 8 mobs that DS becomes the preferred option, anything less BS is superior (assuming you can consistently affect 5 party members).
---
Fenrir is a much better wolf name ;)
---
"Went out due to storm"
---
"Sees stitches"
---
You're in the wrong storm, my [hero] friend.
---
You can tank dungeons as arms or fury spec, moreover you can legitimately tank with a 2h weapon for most of the leveling process anyway. Leveling and doing quests as protection is awful, would recommend you not do that.
---
If you dont like it don't play it. No one is forcing you.
---
Should have gone for Stynx.
---
&gt; Tons of good talents no matter what weapon you use, like 5% crit chance and 40% chance for extra rage.
---
Unbridled wrath is a complete dogshit talent while leveling and especially with a 2hander.
---
I CaNt TaNk Im ArMs SpEc
---
This is so cool. I love this game
---
so for like the last hour now theres been an influx of super retarded posts
---
My character is Iamholy. I am a dwarf priest on Fairbanks. Feel free to mail it to me anytime, thanks ;)
---
35-39 sounds like 20 runs..  that's not 'doing a few runs to get some gear'  with 4 runs you get some gear
---
What does deus ex machina mean?
---
Sword for leveling, with a fast dagger for your offhand to proc poisons quicker and too nudge cast bars.
---
If you are good at positioning then do dagger backstab for pvp and maybe pve, but sword will always still be good
---
This one is fine, its a good quality pic thats easy to read.
---
Not enough rage
---
I dont think they have more mitigation at endgame. Plate armor with shield and Defense cap puts a Warrior at some insane damage mitigation, adding in the 10% less damage taken natively in Defensive Stance.
---
Throw in cooldowns like Shield Wall and even Shield Block and Warrior is easily the most mitigation-capable tank. Pushing Crushing Blows off of the hit table is super important, and Druids simply cannot do it. So, back in the day when everyone was bad, Druids never survived long enough. Now they can, but it is risky, like Fury Warrior tanking 
---
If a guild runs a Fury Warrior tank, they could absolutely run a Druid tank instead.
---
They said they were gnomes!
---
Are you guys playing on golemagg?
---
20/31/0 is a good spec in MC if you know how to keep your Pet alive(and max it’s FR)
---
Getting 4 levels in dungeons is significantly more than a couple runs.  I think it took 5 armories for me to level.  It seems you grinded almost a day in dungeons instead of questing.  This is a choice.  Sorry?
---
I stopped playing in Cata and my cat's name is Faustus.
---
It's not world first if it has ALREADY happened.
---
I love classic
---
Garrote, 1pt rupture, SS, SnD is a great opener that 90% of the time is better than SS x5, evisc.
---
Routinely fight two mobs at a time as a Warrior.
---
That's how Warriors are meant to be played, that's literally the entire point of the Rage mechanic.
---
More DMG Taken = More Rage = More Skills Useable
---
I'd rather fight two mobs and every one of my auto attacks have a Heroic Strike or Cleave behind it than hacking away at one mob HS every other auto.
---
Level the warrior trough dungeons, less questing on a tank or healer is my attitude towards this issue.
---
It's a lot faster and you notice it well. I was thinking the same but decided to buy it, it was worth it. I had already earned back the 100g after a couple of levels.
---
I uninstalled z perl but it still doesn't work :/
---

NEEEERRRRRDDDDDDD
---
&lt;flexing biceps emoji&gt;
---
To be fair, the patch Classic represents was 2006. Reddit launched in 2005. 
---
Also, you know he meant communication in game that transitions to forums in general, so not sure why you gotta be snarky.
---
Me and my buddies transferred from Thalnos to Netherwind. No regrets. No queue times, server is decently populated. Definetly a noticeable difference from 100s of people everywhere to a few scattered but still enjoyable and easier to do kill quests. Would highly recommend.
---
I’m back in
---
This is going in the book of grudges
---
3 levels in 6 hours seems alright to you?
---
Step 1: have a word with yourself 
---
Step 2: buy a pc
---
Step 3: win
---
That sounds like something that would result in a perma ban.
---
i guess i did not push the last update to git, my apologies. 
---
https://www.wowace.com/projects/quartz/files the author is now updating it, use his!
---
Oh nice! I’ll download it ASAP !
---
How come?
---
I use bartender. There’s a setting in there that’s kinda tricky to understand at first but I use it for switching my warriors stances and it accomplishes everything I need
---
Mograine is just fucking up
---
Its getting DDOSed
---
I got plenty from farming it after the fact. Some when farming for other tmogs (my mage got both halves 1 run) and I completed it for my warri
---
Too good!
---
But this is the greek alphabet
---
I felt this in my soul.
---
Bless you. I die a lot &amp; love it when somebody randomly resurrects me
---
Some may be running bots but most will have a 2nd account that sits at the AH 24/7 scanning new postings for good deals.
---
I mean could have been pander, theyve been introduced in wc3
---
You spent more than 6 hours running it honestly. 6 hours is low balling it.
---
No NPCs in towns so there's some serious issues going on haha.
---
Not really. The most I've seen the Staff sell for on my Server is 20g. There's 3, currently in my AH at 17g, 18g and 20g
---
It's too early for people to pay a lot of gold for BoE epics.
---
Either equip it and enjoy feeling powerful for 10 levels or shove it in your bank and wait a few weeks for the economy to establish itself
---
Agreed. I have a 60% keyboard I built (no F keys, numpad, numbers etc.) But I've still got print screen mapped to Fn+P. There really is no excuse lol
---
This brings back so many hunter memories for me. Favorite of which was in BC sneaking into the Dranai starting area at level 15 to get a Ravager since there was a point to leveling your pet with you.
---
But you also have these guys. Me as mage at the start: trade me for water :)
---
Healer after half the dungeon: I DONT GET FKING WATER FROM THIS FKING MAGE
---
You have plenty of room doing quests only. Only the lack of knowledge makes you feel like you need to grind up levels.
---
Doesn't make sense still.  Make a new character.  If you wanted to be a different race in real life you don't have that option.  If you did would you change?  Lmao
---
You chose to spend an entire day running dungeons.
---
I loved fishing and couldnt pass up a wreckage. I had a deal with a buddy, mailed him all my loot and he AH'd and shared proceeds. I had a crap computer and dialup, IF was a no-go territory for me at the time. Accordingly, I ended up only going there to buy thread and such to make my LW items, which I then vendored (and thought I was making bank). It wasnt til much later I found out I could level a DE bot to 10 and start a whole enterprise. 
---
I made a lot of gold selling vision dust after I could farm mats/invest in mageweave from the AH and craft those white bandit masks.
---
As warrior you need like 230g to learn all skills on level 60. Most likely you won't get 230g during the level phase.
---
I was introduced to reddit as a mobile app and prefer the phone interface to the webpage. I don’t post pictures like this tho haha
---
I agree. I can navigate any other Horde city without issue, just not the UC. Even Ogrimmar is easier for me.
---
Discouraged from questing? If anything you grab all the dungeon quests while leveling them hit it up for some guaranteed nice rewards, then you hit leveling again with a nice item power boost and maybe an extra level from the do.
---
not true lol
---
I can't remember exactly what it's called but somewhere in the options there's an option to display floating text and combo points are one of the options
---
did i do that by posting this?
---
I can't say for certain it was such an addon but it was extremely suspicious. Should I report just to be safe?
---
I’m maining a mage this go around in Classic and it never occurred to me to charge for water/food. I just always have some prepared while the party runs to the entrance and hand it out to everyone because plenty of water/food decreases downtime and it’s the right thing to do.
---
They're only 20g on my server. That's ridiculous!
---
This argument doesn't even make sense because they already changed "muh classic" 
---
It's the same copypasted dribble trying to kill the game so they have Pserver numbers again and circlejerk while their boomer asses are still lv42 a year from now about how crazy awesome it is to have a "true RPG" again
---
You can just switch profession skills.
---
That impression is accurate. Ele isn't viable ever for raids. Shaman who want to pvp as ele raid as resto
---
100% since OPs IGN is escargot lol
---
Someone's split their drink over the server.
---
why is it only on mograine ? why us ?

it's not back up it's crashing over and over :/

keeps dcing

He gave credit by tagging the op's which is more than the average reposter would do. Now reposters who repost this repost won't give credit to this guy :(
---
Wake up people. You just compared 4 levels to 10 runs. This is crazy. 10 runs are suppose to give you 1,5 levels at max. You are not in retail anymore. Plus I leveled up 3 levels, learn to count
---
PI is amazing.  You can PI yourself and get better heals off, you can PI an ally when you are getting beat up and they can kill your attacker faster.
---
You underestimate the social nature required to pvp.  You’re probably going to start friending the DPS who peel for you.
---
Keeps going up and down. Loads of people were kicked an hour before the server died too. Wonder why its only Morgraine.
---
Sadly yes
---
My usernames have been captain snail related since middle school so I was sure to snag Snail, Snails, and Escargot on my server! I'm pretty sure he told the joked because he saw my name specifically :)

He’s wrong

Wow, your post is getting some hate. 
---
SO ... I don't know if this exist in classic, but back in vanilla there was a way to turn off exp gain (so people could make twinks for pvp). Here's a link of how it was done, hope it helps.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Level_locking
---
Is this their desperate way of saying we should realm switch?! Hnng!
---
Definitely get consecration first. It helps way more than SoC at early levels.
---
Yesterday I was outside the Gnomer entrance and saw a dead dude, so I rezzed him, and it flagged me for PvP. Immediately got ganked by a high level rogue, but the guy I rezzed was able to get away, and I had to do a corpse run.
---
I was 72 hour banned for saying much less raunchy content and not even in zone chat.
---
How is this not punishable now?
---
There was only one other such staff so for them to be looking for that staff at that exact moment and to have bought it so quickly is pretty unlikely but not necessarily impossible. The time between me posting it and it being bought was basically like 2 seconds if even that long.
---
I have Moonfire *and* instant groups.
---
I feel like Alliance players will help each other out no matter what. Where, when I'm horde, I could be getting mauled by 3 mobs and someone will walk by without a second glance.
---
F
---
If it makes you feel any better my group did the same thing. Gotta use those /target macros lol.
---
Nope it doesnt. It seems to me, you barely played vanilla
---
Correct. Twitch app and mod section works on macOS and WoW.
---
No one is buying that for 150g right now.
---
There's literally 3 of them on my servers AH right now for 20g and they haven't even sold.
---
The best server!
---
I said at least 10 runs. It was probably double that if not triple.
---
AND SHE NEEEEEVERRR WANTED TO LEEEAVE
---
It is written
---
Should do an angry psa, could get some traction.
---
Not referencing Cool Hand Like there, boss.
---
Don't reference Cool Hand Luke there, Luke.

Prior to lvl cap I wouldnt worry too much either way.

At lvl cap what you want to focus on depends on your healer class.

Seal of Command ASAP

Sulfuras costs thousands of gold to make even after you get the eye.

A lot of people will turn their nose up when they see what it actually takes to get it.

Does anyone know how to make mouseover Healing macros with different ranks of the same spell? I can make mouseover healing macros but it won't let me specify which rank of a spell to use, it just uses the default highest rank learned.

---
Dude, the things you mentioned makes up for almost the entire game. If you don’t like to farm then why are you even playing?
---
This is a time sink game where you farm loot to get better loot to do harder content.
---
I think you should look towards a different game. I stopped playing because I realized that I didn’t have as much time to play to get the full feel of it and there’s a lot of new titles coming up that I rather play.
---
Too many RMT multiboxers on that server man, along with streamer fanboys. Glad I switched servers early, makes me laugh when I still see the 5k queue, people be stupid.
---
31/20 disc holt is the way to go for pvp
---
What is so dumb about gearing up character? I made a choice to gear up, not to grind levels
---
Not many ally bother with RFK either.
---
RFD is slighty more popular since melees wanna do the quest in there.
---
Do ya'll not play the same game as me?  I see a decent number of people with speed boosts talking about skipping the 40 mount.  Half this moving from place to place even with efficient routes.
---
For healing dungeons while levelling you wont really get enough +healing to make any substantial difference. 
---
Ideally...from what I remember, shamans are more about +int and +crit with mp5 being their regen rather than spirit
---
However, of course, you'll still benefit from spirit outside the FSR so it's never BAD to have gear with spirit on it.
---
This is nice
---
I would say there’s no point in saving that money.  You’ll have to get the mount anyway to get your epic mount.
---
Different
---
Off-tank is my favorite role. It can see so dynamic, and as a druid it allows me to get the most out of my utility toolkit.
---
You're not entitled to getting things done in a reasonable amount of time. Classic was designed so that most people wouldn't achieve everything. By doing so, it actually feels worth trying to achieve things.
---
Masses were always wrong if we look into history. It only proves me, that im right. And I ran it 9-10 times at max :) Try it for yourself and you ll end up being 60 quickly
---
It's the younger generation that is obsessed with shitchat, erm, i mean snapchat. So anything that happens IRL they _must take a snap!_
---
Don’t warlocks have to pay the same amount, I thought only the 60% one was free?
---
But back in vanilla? You sure you want to make that claim.
---
Was sorted by new, the app is shit. Jumping to assumptions makes an ass out of you 😜
---
45 silver. Not bad.

Interface options under the combat section and enable floating combat text and show combo points

Get an acer/asus with ryzen and low end card. 600-800$ range.

I didnt nope. Its my first time

Real difference:  
---
Horde:  Alright guys, we're all buffed up, ready to engage, lets do it!  
---
Alliance:  I peed my pants!
---
Still down for me now.    BORED now, Fix please Blizzard
---
You're thinking ravaging.
---
If only there was a video where he explained himself
---
This happened to me but with 2 alliance players ganking me, I watched a fellow horde warrior mere 30 yards away stop and stare then move on.
---
Never been more disappointed in someone in my life, what's especially frustrating was that said player was a warrior yet turned out to be such a pussy, I thought all warriors shared the same code of loktar.
---
You've got too much time on your hands 👋👋
---
&gt; Imagine getting 8+years in jail for ddosing a server for 30minutes. 
---
Actually true, getting raped in jail for years, because you made some kid stop playing his game for 2 hours 
---
good :)
---
I was killing yetis and ganked a couple people with my group mate (as alliance) then promptly got mopped by a lvl 40 rogue. I like to think i had some part on starting this fight.
---
I remember getting excited about that quest to kill those orc boss guys in Redridge because “oh my GOD 40 silver is so MUCH MONEY!”
---
Fuck dude I think I lost some brain cells reading that. Barrens chat is a treasure that we alliance are not privy to :(
---
Very sad.
---
Either or
---
Which is why i dont twink in general but as youve pointed out, rogues dominate 19 so much its not even fun.
---
\*o\*
---
DDOSed by roadmen
---
did the /layer chat finally break the server? :P
---
EXACTLY
---
Yes they are, they actuelly thought 6 server in eu was enough on launch.
---
Am I remembering original vanilla wrong when I think this, but didn't Auctioneer used to have something called Bottom Scanner and Blizzard broke it deliberately? So how come TSM is allowed to have a sniper?
---
What are those rare yellow coins? Havent stumbled upon any of those so far
---
Kk. Retail storm had quit for classic so I figured I'd ask. Still cool either way. People don't really invade cities anymore, so it's fun to see this stuff again.
---
Wrong date nerd
---
Then you aren't owed fortitude, imp stamina buff, mark of the wild, red's everyone must tip each other for expending Mana. Again, as a group leader you'd be remove immediately for a terrible attitude. Mage water allows for a faster dungeon run, people can tick drink and move to the next pack, if it's my own water you best believe I'm sitting my ass down until 100% Mana. If I'm the healer and you pull while I'm drinking I'll just let you die then.
---
Nothing proves your right. You ran way more than 10 time gain that many levels.
---
I dont know but I would guess for most pvp servers its somewhere around 40/60 horde favored. Maybe plus or minus 5%
---
Careful you might upset some retail kids...
---
Leveling guide is rather simple. Enter each zone, do all the quests there, move on

oh

other than that i have no idea

Okay, I am convinced and decided to play wow. I wanted to play the free version first. However, when I go to the website, and click on the "play now," which I assume is to install wow classic, it gets a 404 error.   [https://kr.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-subscription?blzcmp=wow\_subscribe\_ragnaros](https://kr.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-subscription?blzcmp=wow_subscribe_ragnaros)
---
Note, I am located in South Korea.   
---
What should I do? Is there somewhere else I can install the game from and start playing the free trial? I am also okay with paying just a month to try it out, but am afraid to pay and still being stuck in this page. I also want to test my laptop to make sure it can handle it.
---
Damn you must be excellent at lua. I didn't get anywhere near that after an hour and a half of trying lol. I'm trying it out now. I'm having a little trouble getting SendChatMessage to work with the tables, but it could easily be my experience.
---
There's no 5k queue anymore tho, connected at 6pm on Friday in 30min. 1k queue approximately.
---
Who actually buys this at this time, even? Level 60s? People stockpiling it for twinking?
---
I don't get it.
---
Exactly the same, if there's more than 3 enemies it's almost always better than swipe.
---
These guys are making a name for themselves.  Good for them.
---
Wrong month :D
---
...haha. I mean, as a vanilla rogue I was that guy, politely asserting my dominance. 
---
Now I am leveling h-priest, full of rainbows and love; blow jobs and cupcakes for every one!
---
Someone who casually mentions their six figure job like that probably doesn't care whether or not it's about them.
---
Wtf is a twink?

1650 damage per minute is 27.5dps on a pet.

Also mob class

Lol I made a NE priest too. 
---
I feel like classic wow is just like that scenario where you wake up in middle school, but you know everything from your future self still. 
---
And still being like “lol I ain’t being no dwarf priest fuck that.”
---
Well that’s not true.  Honestly you aren’t helping yourself at all. You just keep proving that you never played vanilla and have no clue what you are talking about.
---
Oh hell yeah! I'm a mom and I posted the other day in Barrens chat about how I was playing WoW while my kid was at school and a handful of other people were like 'Same! It's so quiet in my house!' and it made me really happy. 
---
Plus, there are so many nice, kind people who play classic. It makes me really happy.
---

No need for video. You go there, kill the naga 1by1 and loot the item. Not rocket science.
---
More like a few months for this sort of item, even.
---
What I miss about having the bank is that it was easier to share stuff. Especially now that everyone is leveling at the same times it'd be nice to be able to put some bronze tubes and unwanted gear in the bank. But we'll survive without it.
---
Lol what? How does he have too much time on his hands?
---
Those kids just want a bit of attention, their mommy didn't give them it.
---
[TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom) will let you set a waypoint through slash command or by clicking the map. The marker will appear on map and minimap.
---
Nah
---
Honestly, whoever is willing to pay for all the mats will generally get it.
---
Bonereavers Edge is better for most classes anyway.
---
He's just talking out of his ass
---
You kill mobs exponentially faster. Yes you do run or of mana quicker but you can get away with a few before you go oom. 
---
If you are sitting on a full mana bar you aren’t playing right.
---
The I5 9600k is the same price as the ryzen right now. Works with a similar Asus motherboard, gtx graphics card. I just built a pc and it runs like a dream.
---
The only Horror here is the number of free bagspaces... uncanny
---
All part of the classic experience!
---
This ABSOLUTELY needs blizzards attention. Merges need to be made available, transfers need to be made available. Let us not forget this is 99.9% blizzards fault with not only their mistakes on launch day, but each mistake that followed. They cannot leave those of us that moved to earthfury to die on a dead server. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE. this is unacceptable
---
I guess that isn't bad when you put it that way. Still, what are normal DPS numbers at 60? I never played vanilla so I have no clue.
---
It's a river, Domo Arigato.
---
Got the tabard b4 the axe. Approx 15 runs
---
That is majorly incorrect.
---
Got to keep them roads clear in the Wetlands too, for the Night Elves.
---
Yeah I just picked up a surface pro 3 and I was reading even that thing can run classic
---
You do realize you can go log in to other servers to see
---
Yes for real man!
---
I don't think you can prevent them from removing it.
---
It was a mid week server transfer onto a brand new server. I expect now that it’s they weekend populations will be up. It may appear empty to you especially if y’all are far above server populations. Is your guild one that pushed hard? Run a server census and see what it looks like. Otherwise I can’t imoffer much but hope it recovers.
---
nice one! Thank you so much
---
morning up to 12am seems like 4-5 hours to me. Do you think I made this topic so everyone can agree on me? I knew, this will be unpopular opinion. But its the right one, you guys dont see it. There is this little quote "observe the masses and do the opposite". It fits your behavior all to well
---
IS JOKE
---
UNDERSTAND?
---
If that was an option it's what they would've done. Neither the design of the game nor the technology it's based on would allow it.
---
I literally saw that movie for the first time in my life yesterday. 
---
... the simulation admins are getting sloppy.

---
When leveling on rested, dungeon spamming is very effective.
---
It's almost as if servers are complicated hmmm
---
What the hell is this post, and why does it have so many upvotes? I mean, who the hell cares? And in the future, get better rolemodels than streamers.
---
I've been playing pretty casually since launch, only level 25 now and I've not had to grind at all. Just moved from the Barrens to Stonetalon Mountains and half the quests were already green.
---
We're all a goblin on the inside.
---
That's more end game optimization, you can make it work with any 2h while leveling or wpvp, still does biggest damage out of all the seals.
---
Buffs and CC have a direct impact on combat so charging for them is impractical they are not the same thing, waiting for you to regenerate mana because you chose not to prepare for a dungeon is not my problem, and i will not make it my problem I'm happy to wait.
---
Forgot that everybody is entitled to water when a mage joins, making him spend 2 minutes conjuring shit for you, then conjuring shit for himself, and then he has to drink it before he can do anything because he used all his mama conjuring. The least you could do is tip them, 20s ain't shit for the time spent conjuring
---
Because blizzard is not going to let 30k people run around on one server all at the same time, refer back to where I said that. If they were, they would’ve done it already? I feel like you’re not grasping the entire point of layers.     
---
If you reduce layers down to 10k, that suddenly puts 20k more people in queue
---
EKZDEH HAHA
---
Fellow dad here, can confirm. Welcome back!
---
Because they're all lvl 1 at the same time, they didn't want questing to be an absolute nightmare for everyone they literally said this. They also said they'd remove it after a few weeks not when p2 drops
---
oh my god.  ive been going around and around with my friend since classic release with this shit.
---
he literally believes that any tank class other than warrior is garbage for even 5 mans....
---
Would love to hear about this too.
---
I can't even tell what you're trying to say, so no that's not what I'm saying.
---
YOU CANT FIND MANKIRKS WIFE? FUCKIN EMBARRASSING
---
They figured Styx was appropriate to name after the band because of the song "Come Sail Away".
---
Oh word, as long as you won’t complain about peeps having to wait for mana then it’s all good.
---
Sorry to hear about this. A couple of my friends wanted to transfer to Earthfury from Skeram, but me and a few others convinced them to stay in fear of exactly this happening. Played on a dead server in BC and didn't want to go through that again.
---
Hope Blizzard helps you out with this.
---
Of course not, we don't have many resources for player population right now, this is just one of them.
---
Youre dumb man jeez
---
Sharpening stones will give you short term enhancement but overall it's a waste to spend cash on that. If you want to make your weapon look even more cool the enchant you have been seeing is beastslayer. Cheap and easy to do.
---
Yeah dude don't be rude this is a pg13 subreddit.
---
Jokerd flew too close to the sun talking to this haxor dude's E-thot crush.
---
Not really, it's just the classic start area shown in the video (echo isles) for orc trolls fucking sucks for spawn and drop rates of items and because the drop rates are so low, grouping isn't worth it for some parts.
---
Plus you have to swim from island to island and do tons of back tracking whereas goldshire everything is right there for you and close, with decent respawn times with little to no back tracking.
---
For what purpose exactly?
---
You're playing mage, so you'll be good with frostbolt keybound. No aoe farm but still.
---
No man, I just feel like you are shit talking now, not even capable of producing reasonable answers so there is no reason to continue. Classic vanilla offers huge variety of quests, go out and explore! You will change your mind
---
NA player here. Herod queue last night was at 6000. It's down considerably from the 15k that it was, but our target transfer realm is still low pop. It doesn't look like people are transferring. Blizzard should have just allowed transfer to the realm of your choice, so player's could meet up with their friends, rather than opening new realms.
---
What AddOn are you using that tells you how much gold something is worth?
---
Trying to make this as visible as possible. Four years ago Blizzard servers were attacked and the attackers got several years in prison. This particular group attacked wikipedia and twitch within the last 24 hours. Visibility will make them renowned, sure, but it will also bring them attention from higher ups who can do something about it.
---
Haha, yeah it is! Quite a few of the members snagged FT related names as well, so it's fun to run into them out in Azeroth and see the pairing with the guild name!
---
If you're horde, look up the Shattered company. Good folks over there and a number of ladies in the guild
---
I would rather just get the Expacs as they were rather then letting blizzard mess with them and change they’re game again
---
Try the steam link method. You can play from your phone.
---
Mini stacks?  Give with the water already
---
BoS is a nobrainer regarless of the class of your tank, judging righteousness with righteous fury up produces about as much threat as a fury warrior's bloodthirst.
---
I'd suggest actually looking at the numbers before making claims based on your feelings.
---
True mmo rpg vanilla wow experience
---
Well, they do have faster run/mount speed than a lot of classes
---
It has a variety of quest but still lacks enough quests to get you level 60. You won’t hit 60 with dungeons or mob grinds.
---
As a super veteran of 15 years, it's so nice to help out true noobs
---
\*Points to ancient writing\*
---
Haha I got Reigen/Polnareff aside from my main so if you see a Mob Psycho/Jojo themed guild lemme know!
---
I was just saying that if you are spending points in the fury tree and are using DW, it's a nice to have talent. Not talking about min-max here, just how it felt while playing with it.
---
"No Change" is defined as no extra features from any expansions. They didn't trust BLZ as they were afraid that BLZ may add some of the conveniences from BfA in classic. However, knowing this game is based on 1.12 from the first day it was announced, they're now still whining about how lack of challenging it is because dungeons and MC are nerfed in the patch. You can chain pull a lot of mobs in dungeons with very little down time. In some videos they can manage 10 mobs without mage. That is not imaginable in vanilla when one dungeon run took at least an hour and you had to sap and sheep every time before pulling. It will be like this until Naxx.
---
Dozens
---
It's good to use on any target, but you get the most value out of it from a low armor value target, in theory. In practice, you probably only want to use it on elite mobs while questing.
---
ESPECIALLY if he's a noob. Yup, fuck that guy.
---
/r/iamverybadass

you
---
I'm playinga mid 30s enh shaman right now grinding SM. After I unlocked chain lighting and magma totem for cleave my dps and overall damage done is insane. I'm usually beating every other class in most pulls right now with the exception of over geared / over leveled warriors and mages during bigger pulls.
---
stop posting it tbh. They are nobodies with 300 followers. All they want is attention and thats what you are giving them
---
Literally who
---
I couldn't get it to work and settled on auctionator. Is there a classic compatible auctioneer now?
---
I hate them for no shoes.
---
Horde scum are all over our witty jokes. The kids came out of the woodworks.
---
Lmao.  That's awesome.
---
They are dead cause no one is tranfering lmao
---
Technically Battle Shout does more but only if it hits all 5 party members which is hard to guarantee so I usually just do Demo
---
I believe backpedaling is ok. It's slow enough to not trigger the leeway
---
Member in actual classic everyone thought Fury warriors were trash? Member when people didnt know to get hit capped? I member.
---
I played to level 10 on remulosbefore felstryker, and it was exactly the same.
---
lol LC0311, this post triggered you hard, I kinda like it
---
the goal is to make the person run off the boat and waste their time, its pretty douchey
---
Most craftable items are either trash or at least very cost inefficient. Go write a balancing suggestion on the forums if you feel strongly about it tho i feel like you might be a bit late.
---
/PvP gets enabled at soon as the character loads in
---
I think just reducing some clutter would help make this way better. You have a lot of stuff that isn’t really necessary and obstructing large parts of the field of view. I would recommend minimalism as compared to style as an overall tip. For example, the 3-D models you are using for your char frames (while they look nice) will likely become more of a nuisance than anything over time.
---
Anyone with 60+iq knew transfer servers would be shitshows full of bottom of the barrel plebs.
---
As opposed to waiting in queue for 3-4 hours a night during primetime? I don’t have time to remote desktop and watch a queue, i have other responsibilities. That doesnt mean i should be relegated to a dead server. Please try to expand your mind and have empathy for others.
---
What is the patron? I've tried googling bur couldn't find anything

Hi mad that I'm crying laughing at this right now.

*I'm dad*
---
As a Hunter,  I throw an Arcane shot and a Sting into as many tagged mobs as I can for my fellow alliance  and I will send the pet if they look to be struggling.   Only 23, I have recieved more help and groups than in a long time of retail.
---
Live in that illusion if you want to, im not taking it from you
---
Hope he has fun picking up the soap
---
Miss miss, 62 sinister strike, miss miss.. we do get gouge early to run away and bandage mid combat lol
---
Lol, that's the funny part, I just consider the world changing drastically and Cata's class design and paradigm shifts the turning point
---
That or CRZ but that came way later
---
Everyone has their own ideas and opinions, which is why I hope Blizzard doesn't drop the support after P5 because there's so many conflicting opinions, people wanting no changes, some people wanting permutations, some people wanting the TBC &gt; onward
---
We'll know hopefully more at Blizzcon, or I hope someone asks the panel about it, because they've floated the idea in interviews
---
Well, nothing. But him being whipped is another reason I ain't getting to play.
---
some people, for sure
---
Just did this for around 40 minutes. Got about 90 shellfish and the fishing pole. Died twice, which made ma lose some time and the area had some other people in it, but not too many. Overall pretty decent, have to try it out at night.
---
If warriors are 10/10 Druids are 9/10 not bad tanks at all
---
No I just hate people like you who come on here thinking they know everything when in reality you know nothing. You make claims with nothing to support your statements.
---
What would be a good build for rogue leveling and dungeons?
---
Also greedy as fuck, the amount of people making a dozen lvl ones which they will never use or use temporarily before handing in their tourist pass and logging out. Just because u can didn't mean u should
---
lmao what in the fuck is going on here? I’ve not seen this before.
---
Of it selling for less than the vendor price man!!!!
---
It's kind of reminescent of an odalisque, maybe look up that type of painting and see if one is the one your uncle has.
---
Cat Dad reporting in. Can confirm we are everywhere.
---
Bartender
---
Manduin
---
Yeah I've had a lot of dungeons where the healer is oom after every pull, even small pulls where you grab just one pack. I usually either chalk it up to mismanagement of mana and lacking gear or DPS that love to self-harm or can't kite (Hellfire warlocks, bad mages) since it's not like tank damage is anything extreme
---
you're obviously doing something to make gold, just standard questing won't get you anything close to that amount
---
I mean Cata is the TRUE severing, but dungeon finder was the beginning of the end.
---
I guess so.
---
That’s something pretty special right there
---
It can also be the worst thing for good marriages :/
---
Same. I was Trisdal Glades until 12, some at Durotar, then some at Barrens until 18. Next thing I knew I was in silverpine at SFK and doing battle for hilsbrad and somehow hit 30
---
##EUthings

Make a macro to target and raid mark. 
---
ggez.
---
One of the first things I spec. into as an low level rogue is the reduced cooldown on Sprint.  I use that every time it's up.
---
You talk so much shit your ass must be jealous of your mouth... Haven't seen "RMT Multiboxers", queues are like 2k at peak times tops, the only relevant streamer wasn't even relevant before getting world's first 60. Besides that, the streamers there have super small fanbases, not even close to Asmon's or Soda's sizes. 
---
Nice try tho.
---
The mount is significantly cheaper, hundreds. You need exalted. The riding skill is the same price but that is not so much gold.
---
What realm are you on? Because I had to create FairyTail, since the correct form was taken already. And how many people have joined just for the reference? We’ve had a surprising amount.
---
Classic good retail bad
---
since "streaming because a job" and when internet points are worth more.
---
How about fuck you and drop dead you pathetic fucker because you are a looser who have a issue about an add on that did nothing to your experience on a game that is NOT VANILLA. So be so kindly and go fuck your self entitle brat.
---
I like turtles.

lol wait thats me

jeah it benefits your party, open world i want a tip as small as 1 s

A character that you level to the max level range of battlegrounds e.g. 19 for the 10-19 range, 29 for the 20 - 29 range etc. and gear up to be very strong in battlegrounds so that you dominate everyone else. People will buy expensive items on their mains to give to their alts for this purpose, explaining why this staff can sell for a lot of gold later on after people have more gold to spare to spend on their alts.
---
Oh damn I want a remind me bot for this one. Lol
---
I was hitting 239 dps max randomly via command price yesterday in a dungeon with another geared warrior who was the same level as me. And i was playint the tank, so id say their dps is all up to rngesus
---
Its the special ability specif to that weapon, it just happened to be identical to the warriors sword spec effect. So if you have the weapon, you spec into the axe/polearm for the 5% crit, and the weapon itself does the other part.
---
There's nothing rude about his reply. At most he forgot to mention that the practice lock is grey by then (which is why Rogues in practice can't level lockpicking with it).
---
He's asking what fights druids can tank.
---
Just don’t need it before the mount it all, but that’s less than an hour of aoe grinding so I’ll be good
---
Why aren't my mods working? I have z perl for classic (downloaded from a wow classic addon site) and it doesnt even show up in my addons tab.  I unzipped it into the folder and I dont see it.

And what, 1 copper for the herb also? Mr. Moneybags over here giving away money.
---
Honestly you may not be doing anything wrong. If there’s other people in the group that are higher level than you that go full blast right from the get go it’s going to be impossible to keep aggro on multiple targets. If that’s the case just mark a skull and keep aggro on one target and if people in the group want to attack the second or third targets and tank it that’s on them.
---
Freital!

Currently level 30 priest trying to plan for 40 + content Respec and dungeons etc. I see a lot of recommendations to respect into shadow at 40 which I understand for solo leveling but there isn't a lot of content online after classic release on whether I'll be able to efficiently heal dungeons 45 + with your average Joe 5 man, somewhat experienced group. is it going to be a pain for me to heal with 40 points in Shadow or if I plan on doing dungeoning after level 45 is it a necessity to switch to holy? I don't want to switch the holy unnecessarily and sacrifice the benefits shadow form brinks to solo leveling as I obviously plan on doing a heavy mix of both. Much appreciated.
---
I did a bunch of reading here to see if playing a druid with the intention to tank was stupid and I'm so glad I pulled the trigger. Good job!
---
I just got this yesterday. Ended up doing Shadowfang Keep as a 4 man group to the very end, after constantly getting ganked by camping horde outside of the dungeon, I was tired as hell towards the end but it was a shit ton of fun. Couldn’t believe we actually finished the dungeon.
---
Well, the way i see it..  
---
We're back on closed servers now, where what you do early on can and will affect you in the later game. You get a reputation.  
---
By being recognized as a "friendlier" player who only fights when forced to, you get a hell of a lot more leeway when youre out grinding than if you were a known camper/dickhead/pvp-tryhard.  
---
Hell, im not even 60 yet and already ive gotten assists from Horde players that i have either left alone, or helped out earlier. You sleep in the made you make, so to say.
---
If a known camper is out grinding pve, guess whos the #1 target to grief?  
---
It sure as hell aint me.  
---
Just because you *can*, doesnt mean you *should*.
---
Demo shout and then keep switching targets and sunder armor
---
This guy dies
---
Wow. Thanks. Swipe is so much more expensive than demo roar. And I’m always rage starved. Going to try demo roar spam and see how that holds up. Thanks again!
---
yo that's my server, too bad i'm playing the better faction
---
Always throw a clutch heal, a earth or flame shock, and rez the dead bodies i pass.
---
Can confirm, am gnome rogue.
---
Yup and clearly it did noting against your so called "social" experience over classic that is not vanilla.
---
You are probably using the retail version. On Curseforge you have to go to the files tab and download the Classic version there.
---
You’re doing what you’re supposed to do. Threat is a huge factor in dungeons and raids and it’s on the dps to make sure they are hitting your target. Demo shout will help bring them together and if they aren’t attacking something other than what you’re hitting, they won’t pull aggro. People forget this isn’t retail or they just don’t know/care.
---
In naxx, druids can tank the entire abomination wing. They are also great tanks for onyxia (alliance) and vael due to their threat generation and those bosses hitting like a wet noodle.
---
Don’t work
---
Oranges vs apples
---
Have you watched skarmtank on YouTube? He has some good bear vids.
---
I m sure rogues try to kill you because you aoe farming and 10 non mages wait for respawns :P well well well
---
It should just pop up once you select it on the computer.
---
If the server cap currently is 10k and there's three layers there's 3,333 people per layer. When the layering is removed there will only be allowed 3,333 people on the server at a time instead of the current 10k. If people don't transfer the queues will get worse.
---
Nothing hurts more than when you’re clearly losing a fight and a priest or palli just runs by you with a care in the world
---
Open with battle and demo shout and tab target through and sunder them all up. If you have 2 sunders on a mob they will probably be okay and you can work on another one. Shout again if you have a bit of rage. Then save rage for next pack to repeat.
---
Stone form &gt; all
---
Competitive fortnite would be the best game on the market if it were ran by anyone but epic.  Nutty high skillcap with nearly limitless options in any situation.
---
...then don't put it up for less than vendor price...
---
Try putting a skull on a target - that’ll for most groups help with DPS focus the same target
---
I'm truly Escargot, but it really was such a perfect encounter it would be hard not to be skeptical. I do hope Nj sees this post, though! The interaction brought me a lot of joy!
---
&gt;Especially when I have a feeling half of the friendly gold posts here are fake.
---
That's why you should stay in the Horde :)
---
I copied a macro another guy made to instantly open a trade window and put a hearthstone in it, a lot of people appreciate a cookie
---
As an Incendius Horde, who's Hat Guy?
---
Been seeing a lot of these. Let's keep it going!!!
---
What add on is that?
---
Once you hit delete, a box pops up and you type in "delete" then press "OK" or hit enter. As soon as it's gone, it's gone.
---
If you use the 5sec rule to your advantage yes. An enhance shaman only has to drop one small heal on themselves every few fights. They're very easy to level.
---
Fuck I could watch kids fall of the thousand needles elevator all day I don't give a fuck about your kids...
---
He'd be getting roughly zero heals.
---
The vibe is different. People do rp and if you happen to interact with them then you are expected to hopefully play along but at the very least not insult them.
---
80% of the time it's a normal server.
---
We'll, just because I can buff, don't act like I owe you buffs. Your mentality slows runs down and makes the world less friendly. You do do, I'll do me. You'd rather wait for Mana than make water without someone paying you? It's quite silly.
---
What does a cat have that can compare with it?
---
Yup i really like that add on and it works wonder with grouping. But i love the classes and talent tree more since they feel more unique and they do matter.
---
Entangling roots was absolutely necessary for that samophlange quest. The mobs are packed in and they run when low health. Also, while you're opening the valves, a couple of other mobs zone in. Just a wonderful quest.
---
Anything can be nostalgic, if we're getting into semantics
---
As previously stated Demo shout is your best friend when tanking more than one target. Dont be afraid to spam it, just to increase your threat. Then changing targets and taunting/sundering aswell. 
---
If you're still having a hard time. Dont be afraid to mark targets (Skull is 1st kill, cross 2nd, moon sheep etc.)
---
Seriously, blizz needs to give some words of comfort about the transfer to a dead server worry. Tell us what they have in plan, like server merges once everything dies down or something. My friends wanted to but I played vanilla on a small server and I really want to avoid that again.
---
Pigman of Rattlegore here
---
But honestly, I wish the allies got a larger group together. I want to say maybe 10 was the largest we saw.
---
perfectly acceptable, i don't expect people to rez me and usually have already released and am on my way back by the time the wipe properly happens if i was the first to die.
---
though if my death is caused by a refusal to heal me because i wont give other people free water (assuming the rez is coming from the healer) then i likely wouldn't want to group with you anyway, being petty because you didn't prepare then getting mad at me about it is a pretty quick way to get in my bad books friend :\^)
---
I play on Hydraxian, and I've never been a huge RP nerd, just thought it brought an extra layer to the game. But I must say, the light RP I've been a part of while just waiting for quest mobs to respawn has been hella fun, and I'm excited to delve deeper into the RP community.
---
This.  I immediately turned my water settings down to low. The new water doesn’t fit the surroundings.
---
Hit items are the only way
---
&gt;Some people have been playing 10-18hs a day since release just grinding quests and dungeons. I admire them. Meanwhile me; get lost on Undercity half of the 3 or 4 hours I play a day.
---
just buys tuff from ah and sell it to vendors, or craft and sell to vendors.
---
vendor shuffles are quite profitable and repeteable
---
Needed a full level of grinding so it helped keep me on track.
---
Sure, but when someone says screenshot they're 99.99999% of the time referring to an actual screenshot, and not a camera picture of a screen. This is super common knowledge. You're being pedantic. 
---
Try Googling "Screenshot" and look at the first 1000 results. They're all about actual screenshotting, and not about taking photos of your screen with your phone.

Thought it was just a funny clip to share?

It's not double by that point, the feral druid in question has BWL gear available

Your char looks more like my bank alt. NoHoBank. Representing us "Barry"-fans out there

Realm is Full. Position in queue: 8294
---
I find it interesting that I can run Classic on max settings at 144fps no problem while Retail only played at 50fps on max settings. And tbh, besides the character models and advanced combat animations i dont feel like classic looks bad or old compared to bfa
---
But you're the one being petty as well?
---
Whenever I put the Rank in parantheses it does not work for me.
---
You’ll want to learn to mark targets and establish what easy symbol stands for like: skull is first, blue diamond is sheep/2nd and green triangle is sleep/3rd. You can make macros that will apply that symbol to them by mouse mover and pressing a button.  Then if they attack other than order or something not your target it’s their fault.
---
yea. I'm surprised so many people get offended when someone raises this issue. They turn it into a race/bigotry argument.

yeah, I thought about going back and changing it, but decided I didn't care enough for the distinction  :D

Leveling my first alliance char at the moment and really looking forward to Duskwood for the first time!

That has always been standard for me. You buff everyone you see.

Lots of people abuse layering and chests. Honestly these people should be banned. Im not joking when i say they are making THOUSANDS of gold in little time because of abusing exploits.
---
People who would rather have it than a mount?
---
As a horde player now playing alliance I have seen a lot of assholery too. When the game first came out all the children's played Alliance nowadays it's a mixed crowd as all those folks grew up but I hope I start running into more nice human beings on the alliance side. Maybe it will change my opinion of them. I have a friend who will only roll alliance so I am trying. I was an orc warrior on Lightninghoog through mists.

YES!!!!!!!!!!  GET IN HERE!!!!!!!!

I don't remember dumb political arguments and memes back then though...

Smolderweb! I'm not sure how many joined for the name, I joined for the community! There are over 500 members last I checked, and it's really fun to be in!
---
So if the cat does over 300 dps and doesn't die, it should be better. The wolf has the option of standing back and howling against bosses that kill pets easily, so it's somewhat situational regardless.

Oh no, it's you the one who tried being pedantic, I just answered you playing your own game.

I take screenshots in the normal way like almost everyone, and guess what? I also prefer when people do the same, but the whole point of this post was about how great the community is in classic, and instead of being happy about it some people are acting retarded just cause he used his phone. Isn't that ironic? Sounds kinda like the opposite of great community

There are two options, I either do an amazing charge into battle and may add another mob or I throw my silly little tomahawk at this boar to pull him out of the group.

Sorry i wasn't ment to be rude. I assumed he didn't read it because from what i wrote that's obvious i know it's for leveling the lockpicking. The question was about why would i make them or buy them when i can just go to barrens and level the lockpicking there for free. Also yes i forgot to mention that they go grey after a certain level of lockpicking.

Obviously a world first for classic...

Blizzard has collectively lost its mind. I know he's trying to make a joke geez. Bad timing.

Anyone know how to do this? Haha would be fun to set up a 2-3 multi box. Or 2000. Not sure. Asking for a friend.

I think they'll only aggro when they're returning if you happen to be close to where they're supposed to be. I've had chains of mobs run straight past me without aggroing because they had been dragged so far and I wasn't near their spawn points.

what makes those 2 best for pvp?

Elaborate, Goddamnit!

tbc and wrath was peak wow. classic is meme tier nostalgia that we'll get over pretty quickly

You get to know it pretty fast it’s not to large.

In vanilla, (for me, a month before BC dropped) i remember playing as a hunter and my abilities and arrows would go through every tree and I thought it was so damn cool considering i came from being a runescape player and all trees were LOS. Was a nice change of pace considering yeah technically it looks weird that arrows are going through trees but kinda seems right. The game would feel so clunky without that while leveling.

Started a week ago Lvl 20 Hunter
---
The issue is, in 1-2 months when 20-30% of the players leave where does that leave you on a new realm?
---
I am on Mograine EU and it opened 5 hours before launch. This has the perfect balance with 1-3h queues on peak during a 5hours window.
---
He meant SFK part, where you need to loot hammer at the stables
---
The average population will always be 30 or below when people realize that level 44 is only halfway to 60. Classic wow may be a slight anomaly since the population is already experienced in this concept of time sink.
---
I've enjoyed this set up to lvl 35, it's nice.
---
What are you talking about? Cat is 4 fite, not for heels.
---
Woah. The feels. 
---
Or it’s a mob one level above you soloing you because of a 3.8 swing timer and the sounds of 3 parrys in a row.
---
girls must love you
---
There is a base chance to hit, and you can reduce that with %hit items.
---
The forsaken had no business ever being in the horde. Just look at what they've done in bfa.
---
Goblins or ogres would have been better vanilla horde races but blizzard wanted edgy zombies.
---
You know it is som cringy script kid when he is publicly asking for Faerlina IP. Anyone with a brain could get a hold of it easily.
---
When i play warr and indeed also shaman bc it helps passive regen i cycle my cds.  Potion one mob, bandaids the next mob, healing wave next, and after one more ill use the downtime to craft a few bandaids or cook or proffession etc.  Always good to be using every tool in your arsenal in cycles
---
Racing to lvl 60 in your first wow experience is a waste imho. But to each their own.
---
This is an epic gamer moment indeed
---
Additionally, don't forget to level up your pet spells in your spellbook (where you access professions) . It isn't explained anywhere and I thought when I buy the petskills from the trainer it'd learn it automatically, lol.
---
I realized it at lv20 haha
---
I couldn't roll both alliance and horde on the Rp server I was on in vanilla, so I had two accounts and ~~exploited~~ used the neutral AH extensively.
---
I want BC, that is all
---
This is true. If you expect to gear up however, sometimes its not enough
---
Holy fucking shit are people really as stupid as this commentor
---
But this is reddit :)
---
I don’t like windows 10 for that reason. You can’t even turn the updates off either.
---
Eh, that's a good point. The wolf also has a bit more health and armor, so it has a wee bit better survivability.
---
Honestly, I'm leaning more towards the wolf purely for aesthetic reasons, but I really wanted to get this howl thing figured out first. I guess it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.
---
After you play ARK:SE habit becomes obsession
---
Imagine risking jail time in order to suspend some server for and hour
---
Half the reason I'm inviting mages is for the water.
---
There are enough DD's out there. I would ask if he is serious and if he says yes, I'd kick him and invite a new DD.
---
I’m under the belief that you can get all that information and immersion in a much less cluttered way with more efficient addons and addon structure (ie. if you do minimalism correctly you *should* be getting all the information and immersion you are talking about with as little clutter as possible). However as I mentioned if you like the aesthetic and you feel like you are getting all the necessary bits and bobs then there’s no reason to change it. However if your asking for ways to make it *better* then you may want to include some subjective criteria for what you consider a positive gameplay experience.
---
I feel bad because as a shaman I don’t have many buffs to give, so I give people underwater breathing. Might come in handy who knows lol

Awful advice. Plenty people who have never played WoW before levelled warrior 1-60 (I did it)
---
You got your druid to level 12 before you decided it was boring. I'm sure you completely understand how druids play and can compare it to level 60 / endgame
---
Yeah, mage is great, but you said yourself you never played WoW before. So how can you say a mage is BY FAR the MOST FUN (your words). You could have said "it is BY FAR THE MOST FUN I HAVE HAD IN WOW"
---
anyway, I'll just wait for [deleted]
---
Wasn’t the vast majority of his info based on pserver numbers? His information may not be that accurate.
---
Something tells me the National Socialist party will not arise again in Germany, regardless of how people hold their arms.
---
&gt; Don't level cooking.
---
Stopped reading there. As a warrior you will be relying on food a lot and it will start costing you a pretty penny quite quickly. Half of the time you are killing beasts who drop cooking reagents - why not turn them into stat food excess of which you can vendor for REALLY high prices?
---
I'd have to agree with this not being good for Ret.  Corrupted Ashbringer is reserved as Ret 2-Hander.  Considering Ret is highly driven around Crit.
---
Trade Skill Master, it's an AH add-on.

It came back up for ~10 mins. fml

Welcome back :)

Skills cost money. Just wait.
---
In Ironforge there’s an underground tram that will take you to Stormwind. From SW it’s an easy walk to Westfall, which will have more quests for your level.
---
I'd bang.

No, its so small it shouldn't matter. Almost every Shaman are orcs, be a troll mon!

Hate speech has a definition. Perhaps if you feel like you’re being accused of hate speech too much, there’s something wrong?

Pigglywiggly, one original and two of them with some special character i’s in place of the regular i’s. They didn’t even gank me, they were just following me while I fought centaurs in desolace. Multibox I think. Dunno where I’m going with this...
---
That guild names though.
---
I just did the same! Thanks again!!
---
For the alliance
---
Having a quest not tell you where to go and mobs being on the other side of the region is not immersion, it’s just bad design which is why people had to make these addons even in classic wow
---
I used to play so much mage and consider playing it also in classic but i chosed warrior instead coz they are harder. I also dont have alot of time to play wow but o boy the satisfaction level for me when i hit 60 on warr whats "hardest class to lvl" will be huge and at 60 i will crush skulls. 
---
mage is great and i do recomend him and hunter for new players coz they are on easy side, but both have high skillcap.
---
Everything thats not 101% minmaxed, perfectly optimized and played at last by 80% of the population is a "Meme spec", "Meme build" or whatever these days.
---
Doesn't matter what game.
---
If that's real that CM is probably going to get a talking to lol
---
There's also the fact that (for horde at least) all the best weapons from 16-29 are all staves. So yeah, go ahead and hit need warrior bros.
---
From one orc shaman to another, don’t be that guy. You will enjoy a far smaller repair bill and piss the group off far less. Just stick to flame tongue weapon. It’s is a smaller block of damage however it gives you two chances to crit to scale up to rock bitters potential without the threat.
---
Just like you front-load your spells while questing, you can schedule your heals in bursts so you have the 5-second wait that triggers spirit regen. Also if your DPS keep pulling agro and taking damage, you educate them a little on threat management. Also, consider lower-rank heal spells to avoid over-healing
---
As a hunter you easily outleveled priests and warriors struggling to kill mobs for quests outside of instances. Making friends with them at that point would mean you’d be able to message them now “hey man feel like running an instance?”
---
As a former warlock I can tell you there’s still time to do that.
---
No prob man, it should do exactly what you want I think!
---
Also, there is a way around focustarget; if your focus is going to be the same all dungeon. You can just do:
---
/target NAMEOFFOCUS
---
/assist
---
Just edit your macro before every dungeon (kind of annoying, but not that much work)
---
This is possible provided you are not on your Mainhand Weapon swing timer, or on GCD. Ideal after mind flay in my experience. Tap attack, then \~.4sec later tap wand.  
---
[https://streamable.com/2std8](https://streamable.com/2std8) For proof that you can use this to stack hits.
---
He was replying to someone who claimed that feral has "the highest single target threat generation for all of vanilla"
---
So yes, it's absolutely reasonable to point out that it's possible for something else to go higher.
---
When talking strictly about the highest possible, the ease of reaching that doesn't matter because that's completely beside the point
---
Imagine if you applied that logic to something like a discussion about the most expensive car in the world:
---
&gt;Person 1: "The most expensive car in the world is a mustang"
---
&gt;Person 2: "Well no, it's the Rolls Royce Sweptail"
---
&gt;You: "Comparing a tailor-made completely unique car to something anyone can buy at the used car lot down the street. Seems reasonable."
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
No it isn't.
---
People already want an lfg tool and they even use addons despite Blizzard saying they would block it. But those guys won't stay in classic imo. (Oh and you don't have to go to a city to recruit, there's a worldwide lfg channel) 
---
You're right when you say that players killed the game. Imo it's because wow's success attracted tons of players that were interested in the gameplay and didn't care about the rpg elements. Blizzard removed these elements to keep them. However i'm sure you can sustain the rpg game style, private servers are the living proof of this. But yeah, not with a huge playerbase.
---
Some feral pvp players play this for the proc freeze... you can get a good price out of this
---
RedLetterMedia is a national treasure.

Pretty sure he was goofing on people with you. Not sure how he managed to strike a nerve.

Only about 22 months of ingot farming left to go!
---
While the Classic-WoW community may be more wholesome and mature than retail or vanilla, the reddit sure as hell is not lol. Look at all this REEEEEEEE about the cell pic and then debating the definition and practical assumptions of what is/is not a screenshot.
---
Must be on that STV - EPL connection. Plenty of time to get that questing frustration out via reddit.
---
There is a theory in the community that multiple reports flags a player for automatic suspension 
---
/punishment through a bot. This was never really confirmed though. Iirc it started because of a multiboxing streamer who would almost completely fill a side in Ashran and farm kills or something, someone managed to kill the driver character and had all of the accounts report him. The player did get suspended but I remember reading something that said there was some actually sus behavior on his account, though that could have been blizz saving face.
---
that will teach us from having wholesome fun on a video game! He's really stickin it to us!
---
did not know that. OK I'll pay for the week.

---
As for the race, no there is no issue with picking Nelf. The number one rule imo is to play what you want to play. If you don’t like your character than what’s the point. In terms of PvP Nelf is actually pretty sweet. Their racial allows you to put 2 less talent points into Master of Deception (increases stealth potency so harder for enemies to see you). 3/5 in that talent is almost identical to 5/5 for any other race so you can put those 2 extra talent points into something else for more damage or whatever. Nelf is a good choice. As for swords, yes swords will be the fastest way to level. However this is only true if you spec into them in your talents. 
---

This is a good website I’d recommend checking out if you haven’t already. Give it a read, you’ll find a ton of useful information including the best talents for leveling. You will be significantly hindered by going into all three branches at once. It’s better to just stick to combat while leveling for the most part. Hope this helped
---
I leveled my paladin as prot the entire way through classic (never made it to 60 before BC came out) While it took forever to kill things, it was great to just pull as much as I could, and consecrate over and over while never dying.
---
can u not set up a macro to /targ and when the mob is actually targeted you auto attack? Or you just not very familiar with spawn spots for that to be valid.
---
Your "tip" is for new players to play mages, this is a dumb thread.
---
All these first Ragnaros kills are being done by groups that have been practicing on private servers.  Their experience will by no means me the experience of the majority when going into any of the endgame content.
---
Kinda. I hit 30 on my paladin then decided I didnt wanna spend another 30 levels auto attacking so switched to a warrior, which is now 22... But now I feel like I wanna play a caster.... Always do this to myself.
---
Shamans are the second most played on horde. They just start in kalimdor so they aren't everywhere yet.

[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQlPr3hxXuA)

Did someone say superiority complex? The person is just saying what’s most fun for them. They never claimed mage was objectively the best, most powerful, most enjoyable class. They just said they liked it. 
---
Also, that last bit was cute. It’s sweet how you feel like you made a point when all you did was blow some hot air, show off your shitty reading comprehension, and act smug.
---
Yeah I only have 2 hours played. I try to sneak in a couple minutes here and there through some other things. If I ever hit a queue longer than like 20 minutes it completely kills my session. If I had a full day I could probably reach 20. I've done that before when I played during vanilla. Hoping to get one soon
---
Wait this is so cool I’ve never seen this happen before
---
Get last hits, use specific ranked heals instead of spaming high rank, don't be afraid to ask to drink between pulls.
---
I don't reall care, just wanted to know if there's any other way i can use them.
---
You're fighting an uphill battle, but keep at it. Good luck!
---
I recommend Fairbanks Alliance. There’s queues but not nearly as bad as these other servers, and it’s never dead.

If it was the wetlands theres an enemy that curses you to be an undead and it changes the tooltip
---
No rep required for the ingot turn-in.
---
Nice!
---
You kind of answered your own question already, there’s no point in playing a class you don’t enjoy.
---
&gt; if it has spirit then it is a warriors strongest leveling stat, period
---
You got numbers to back that up? It seems highly unlikely, given the lower amount of downtime strength and weapon dmg gives you from killing stuff faster. 
---
Spirit may be undervalued, but strongest stat? Under no circumstances do I see it, but I’ll readily admit to being wrong.

No really, usually in these quests with a group the mobs are dying faster than they respawn. No one is going to care if someone goes afk for a bit, the worst that happens is people finish and uninvite you from group or leave it.
---
Yesterday I was on my way to Uldaman with a group. Just in front of the dungeon entrance (The cave prior to the instance entrance), I get jumped at by a rogue and a priest. While the warrior of my group just rides straight into the cave leaving me to die.  
---
Soon after I am back at my corpse I ress, regg and summon my voidwalker, in case of another gank. I see the rogue stealth right in front of me and death coil him. Then I die to priest and rogue again.  
---
The warrior on our group: "Warlock, can we start summoning?"  
---
Boy did I told him to get his ass over to me, because he left me to die.
---
Same thing happened to me. Also on Zandalar Tribe.

Yeah I got a random DC just now. Seems like an issue on Blizzard's end.

I have to agree. They’re not helping, and it’s just going to make your experiences worse once layering is disabled.
---
Where you in the Wetlands? There are two boats on the far west side of the zone full of ghost/undead mobs that put a debuff on you that turns you undead.
---
just curious, is this shit kind of ruining the classic game experience for anyone else?

It’s really not. Have you been to ironforge?

Not entirely true. Over 10 guilds have done MC so far and a lot of them have never done MC before. Staysafe cleared MC with a group he assembled from twitch chat.
---
Please don’t. The populations on the other servers are fine. Don’t make the queues worse if you’re a fresh player.
---
Psych 101 aka practically common knowledge
---
Engineer for PVP, enchant is super useful though. In the old days I made a fortune finding items that disenchanted into mats more valuable than what they were selling for, then turning the mats into a crusader enchant. People would pay for disenchanting sometimes. It was also cool to enchant the bracers of someone who was particularly helpful while leveling.

like when the speed runners were doing it, they were completely alone in there zones or even servers. but now every alliance player is trying to mimic jokerd's rotations (plus the various horde guides). so if you go to those mobs your going to find 10+ mages all trying to do it.
---
so you killing the mages, is actually a godsend as it frees up mobs for the rotation of another mage rofl
---
This is possible provided you are not on your Mainhand Weapon swing timer, or on GCD. Ideal after mind flay in my experience. Tap attack, then \~.4sec later tap wand.
---
[https://streamable.com/2std8](https://streamable.com/2std8) For proof that you can use this to stack hits.  
---
For the wand-weaving continually throughout the fight - that's not possible
---
Same here. Logged in, killed a single mob, got DCed, cant log in. Doesnt even load my characters @ character select.
---
You can't if you don't appreciate the building.
---
Tell your friend to check for isboxer ;)
---
How did you get that? What engineering level is it and what are the mats 😂 need to level up
---
I didn't play WoW at all before Classic. I have no sentimental attachment to the game. That being said I'm a lifelong gamer with previous MMO experience.
---
In my opinion you couldn't ask for a better game to devote yourself to. The combat is deep and satisfying, the world is fun and interactive, the community (on my server - Skeram) has been welcoming and cooperative.
---
I've been having a blast since Classic WoW released and I have nothing but confidence that I will find a similar level of enjoyment moving forward.
---
It's up to you how you want to spend your time. You could make worse choices than Classic.
---
Had the same problem. Looks like it just came back up for me!

same here &gt;.&lt;

Was this last night on Fairbanks?
---
Adi bags just become available for classic I highly reccomend that over any other bag addon
---
Hey I’m doing this quest on my 25 warrior on the fro part dam is it hard to find a group to help me. No one wants a 25 war dps for rfk
---
You need to read it again.
---
No part of your story makes any sense. I don't understand why people just make shit up like this.
---
Or gank you. :(
---
ye just saw twitter ,they are "working on it " and there will only be "update "in an hour lol...so perhaps tonight is busted for playing.Fuck.Why did they even target only Mograine its not like its most popular server even its behind likes of Firemaw and Gehennas et c.Guess it was random ?
---
Actually the images don’t really explain anything at all, just saying
---
U giev?
---
Lot of people don't tune their mouse psi to the point where doing 360s are comfortable.
---
Backpedal doesn't trigger leeway fyi
---
So what happened? Lol
---
Eagle eye is set to a 100 yard radius of YOUR character, he is exploiting a Macro Bug that basically allows the Eagle eye to be cast across the entire continent over and over again, with his herbalism profession enabled, he can check the whole zone in 30 seconds without his character moving an inch, it's a massive bug ripe for abuse.
---
People keep saying it's for poison application but that's not true for offhands. The real reason for fast offhand is for more pushback against casters. Poisons are ppm based. If you go swords go for 2 swords for obvious reasons. If not, you aren't pigeonholed into a dagger offhand and this is especially true while leveling.
---
PrtSc
---
just pick the profession you want. smith is pretty useful in combination with mining obviously because u can craft really good stuff
---
Lol get fucked
---
I'm also curious about this...
---
Paladin main here since WotLK. I almost switched my main class simply because of how boring Paladins can be to play in classic. Eventually, I gave in and made my Pally, but it is playing the exact way I thought it would. So, in the end, this is Classic. I don't want it to change, but I also realize that if I play the lower end classes, then I am going to have a more boring/simple/slower experience than if I play a mage, for example. That's part of what makes Classic what it is and that shouldn't change. Everyone is just going to have to work a little harder if they want to play Pally, Druid, Shaman, etc.
---
My guild is rampantly abusing it as well. We're also just a nobody leveling guild, but still.
---
 How would I go about getting the skill to use swords. Do I have to go to SW to be able to use swords? If I do, what would be the best way to get there, right now I'm in Darkshore.
---
Hybrid tax was s almost gone in wrath and cata which had talent trees (cata had a slightly restrictive one)
---
thanks brother
---
Say no to drugs
---
Thats some sad sad kid that got called a retard by a streamerand now hes mad ?
---
Theres an addon called moveanything it lets you move any frame or ui in the game
---
Rofl
---
Just switch to prot man, you'll get all the invites
---
Must have been so satisfying. This makes me wish I rolled lock instead of rogue.
---
Report player: ungriefing
---
That place is a nightmare. Specifically that pack seems to be bugged af.
---
No addon. Right click on your frame - move frame - unlock frame. Then move it wherever you want.
---
Hello there! Definitely it is getting better, it took me only an hour to get in around 2-3 pm \~
---
That was my thought process behind picking shaman this time round.
---
I use monkeyquest, it has its own window to display quests and you can move it around. Also when you click on the quest it’ll open a new window with the quest text so I think that’s what you’re looking for.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Currently not
---
Looks like the rogue looted a locked chest instead of letting the group roll and this dudes salty.  Protip foe rogues say you don't  have the skill and come back when no one's looking to avoid crybaby bitches
---
One of the most sought after gloves for dps warriors. 
---
Worth at least 800-1.5k depending on your server.
---
You need to hold onto these for a few weeks and then you get your epic mount.
---
Gears.
---
You will try, and I will bubble hearth.
---
If you ever want to tank, definitely take advantage of a leveling partner to ease the pain of warrior leveling.
---
Also you would be the gate to dungeon running, which means he could run any dungeon he wants any time he wants give or take.
---
First step would probably be to stop using the controller. You're likely to have difficulties raiding later.
---
What a tool.
---
39 was a popular twink bracket because shaman/Druid can go zoom and no one else can, and no mounts around.  
---
Also lots of really good gear around that range.
---
Sweet nectar of revenge in WoW PvP is still one of the best feelings games EVER gave me. No joke, nothing felt better. It is some WoW magic, I think.
---
Apparently its texture is "slime" and its flavor is "buttered garlic"
---
wait what kind of sens doesnt let you do a 360? what kind of sorcery is that.
---
I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for but Monkey Quest puts a tracker under your minimap with more information about quest objectives than the default one does. Also with Monkey Quest you can click on a quest from the tracker and it will pop up a window with the quest text in it, you can move this window around to anywhere you like on your screen.
---
I will move on with my life.  It will be hard. But I will find a way.
---
How about first consider what type of role you'd like to fulfill in group content -- like tank, heals, or dps. Or will you primarily be questing/adventuring alone?
---
Also consider the racial bonuses for all races. Some are better than others in certain situations.
---
Even professions are something to consider at this point. For example, enchanters are constantly broke because we disenchant the junk that everyone else is selling to vendors. That is why my enchanter is a warlock, who doesn't have to pay 100 gold for his level 40 mount. Paladin is another class with a free mount, but they're only available to alliance players.
---
After you've decided on your character, you can research their pvp viability to help determine if you'll want to play on a pve or pvp server.
---
Hit me up with any questions. I have more experience with the horde, but I've played alliance too. Also, if you wind up as a horde in Kromcrush (pvp), I'd be happy to help you out there as well!
---
The chat on Smolderweb never fails to make me laugh.
---
Well this is a shitpost if I ever saw one!
---
Hardcore, I'm shaking in my little space boots.
---
What does it do that others don’t?
---
You could do this in vanilla.
---
Rich guys am I right?
---
I mean if rogue is only one who can open it... should be his imo lol

Is Stormrager really BIS pre-raid phase 1?
---
Love when this kind of shit happens to rogues
---
Idk if this was a dungeon or not but I normally make the group for my bud and I when we play. Would’ve kicked that Mage without hesitation. Manage your mana? What kind of lame excuse is that?
---
1 button judgement/seal.  Mouseover healing.   More to come eventually (raid icons, mouseover blessings)
---
Now who is the villain in that chat? And why?
---
Well maybe someone has very similar name to yours that undercut his postings and ruined the market lol.
---
Rolled dwarf priest to 26. Will be my main. This is on Herod . Will roll a gnome rogue soon. 
---
Rolled horde on pve server decided I prefer pvp. 
---
I’ve rolled multiple shamans and warriors across a few pvp servers . Decided to go with Grobulus and currently have a shaman at 10.
---
I figure I’ll bounce between both servers
---
this is the wow classic forum not your fanfiction blog
---
I have no idea what is going on in those images.

I've seen it back in classic.

I know, I'm not impressed, just find it bizarre the two are related.

She dead

End result - epic boes will be cheap as fuci , because there is so many of them

Skirmish? U mean grouping up with randoms just looking for horde/ally?
---
Not a meme spec......
---
I made 60 gold yesterday to get my mount and I feel terrible. Would not recommend.
---
Do you perhaps have a popular name that someone else tried to copy with similar spelling or alternate letters? He most likely meant to whisper someone else with a similar name as you. If you haven’t posted anything for sale in trade or AH this is most likely the case
---
Life must be hard when you're so bitter that something like that upsets you so much.
---
Go outside
---
I'd love to level with 4 runecloth bags!!
---
Yup, you definitely do have that addon.
---
Druids weren’t bad, players were too bad to figure it out.
---
That said, the raids got cleared the first damn week. If anyone wants to complain about sub optimal specs or race/class combos...they need to really reevaluate why they think these margins of optimization matter so much for content so trivial. 
---
Sincerely, one of alliance rogues that didn’t want to play human.
---
Well for wow you can use em as extra keys. But for other things my friend for example bound hes password to one of the macro keys. So he just press that one key and it writes his password for him
---
The currencies build up. Certain amount of silver turns into a certain amount of gold
---
looks like Alterac Mountains just up the road north from Tarren Mill
---
Youll be okay and your racial is still useful! Its rare to see a troll shaman from what I've seen
---
This!
---
It's correct. People are deluding themselves. It's the same game it was then. Yes, it's fine to bring some bad specs, but telling everyone that everything is viable gives people false hope.
---
I was a shaman in vanilla and was dismayed to find that their dps really wasnt viable and wish someone warned me.
---
How
---
You may be right, but I think one factor that is sometimes overlooked is that (comparatively) few children and teenagers play wow classic long term. It's a slower game that attracts a lot of people who played 14 years ago.
---
I like to think that's a big factor in what makes players more mature and sociable on average. Exceptions will always be there, and reddit has a way of making us think that exceptions are more common than they are, but I think even when going into the endgame, classic will be more social than vanilla was.
---
Auctioneer.
---
Tradeskillmaster also do this
---
Hands down the most useful post I've read on this sub. Thanks for sharing.
---
One question as I'm tinkering: How do I incorporate the interrupt and shield swap macro without hitting the 255 character limit?
---
fucking alliance
---
Ah gotcha, thanks
---
It feels even more special ganking each other. I genuinely am excited knowing I am brewing discontentment between the factions.
---
I want it to be a good fight!
---
Im at my kid's soccer game right now!  Gimmie a break!
---
Doing a 360 takes more than 3 inches of mouse movement on my mouse. That's a pretty common setting for people who don't play games that need high settings.
---
More than three inches = goes off the edge of a mouse pad. Even if people don't use mouse pads the area for a mouse to move around in tends to be about the size of one.
---
You have it right
---
why do posts like this exist? literally nobody cares what you do with your mouse in your computer game dude
---
Does anyone have a spamable wand attack macro that doesn't cancel if I'm already wanding? I found one on reddit from a while ago but it doesn't seem to work properly.
---
I jump backwards to keep jumpshot practice on par.
---
I had a guy yesterday crying over me selling Free action potions for 50silver each. He had his listed at 1.5gold, his reason is "guilds are killing rag they'll need these you're ruining it for everyone" easiest ignore of my life.
---
I mean, I wouldn't want that kind of player to tank anyways so it's an absolute win
---
how do i send letters with items like this to people?
---
Any advice is welcome in my opinion. Just don’t be to bothered by those so called ‘elite’ players. There are a lot of new players out there, they probably be happy with your experience.
---
And this post put in a greater context: Reddit looks sometimes as an awkward place. I’ve never experienced such DM (lucky enough) but find it hard to think of what is acceptable on here and what not.
---
Keep these edgelords away from Old Blanchy please.
---
Hahahaha! I am using keyboard and mouse
---
I can't remember installing anything special for this and have it in my game. Think it's default.
---
&gt; Isn't it the exact same speed either way (assuming everybody gets equal tags)? If 3 people kill 10 mobs a piece and a group of 3 kill 30 mobs doesn't it just equal the same exact drop rate except the divvy of items is random rather than based on who tags first?
---
Totally, I could see it that way. That's fair. Good point.
---
SIGH
---
0 out of 8 or so?
---
just gonna throw this out there, game is only on week 2. Layering is going to be around for a few months until phase 2. Thats alot of time for guilds to layer abuse and stockpile just about everything they need.
---
People are still leveling atm and farming probably isnt a primary concern yet. 
---
Just pointing it out, personally im glad we have layering, i dont see how the game would have been playable without it due to how many people there are.
---
Must be doing it wrong
---
Wish I had Xp again
---
If that's your definition of "classic+", we're already in it. See: right click to report, which didn't exist in Vanilla.
---
Are you completely new to vanilla? This is how eagle eye and far sight worked.
---
Most PvP servers horse outnumbers alliance. I doubt there is a 50:50 ratio on any of them.
---
Not literally who anymore
---
Imagine being a 12 year old wiggah manlett hACkEr using ddos scripts fOr ThE lUlZ
---
Blizzard botched the servers so horridly, and it all stems back to how few options they made available on day 1 of name reservation day. You can't release 5 servers for a massive region like The Americas, and then release 1-2 at a time every few days after that. Of course nobody is going to leave their friends and guilds on the initial servers announced. They needed to open name reservation day with 10+ servers and all of this would have been avoided.
---
I refuse to accept GOT S8 exists. Pretending it’s 2018 makes that easier /s
---
Thanks will edit lol.
---
Didn't understand anything wrong, this is a stupid post.
---
Are you just going arbitrarily slow or what?
---
Is there an actual reason to not pull a bunch of mobs if you have one of the best aoe classes in the game?
---
Also pretty much every class has *some* type of decent aoe.
---
This, it’s 15 seconds for a 15 minute buff, and the whole raid should be doing those 15 seconds at the same time anyways.
---
Thanks man. Will try again later.
---
Right click to move your camera not left click
---
You apparently don't understand anything. If record times on private servers counted, then Jokerd didn't beat a 15 year record since the time he did was quite longer than his own personal best record on a private server. 
---
But the times on private servers DO NOT COUNT towards any times on official Blizzard servers. So try again.
---
Not only is nobody going to watch this video the title makes you sound super pretentious
---
I suggest using Rend I’m all targets. Steady dmg/threat, and when bleeds are applied they don’t get resisted or whatever. 
---
I tank 4-5 mobs regularly with only a few issues every now and then. Can’t be avoided if dps just doesn’t care about pulling aggro/attacking random mobs. 
---
The best tank in the world can’t old aggro off 3 different dps going full dmg on 3 different mobs without relying on bigger cool downs than taunt.
---
Keep him sapped for 10 mins
---
Will try again tonight.
---
Thankgodshesonbirthcontrol
---
this has nothing to do with layering
---
Leveling is literally the worst content in the game and the faster I get it over with, the more fun I'll have.
---
I play US and saw exactly one the first day or two. Haven't seen any since.
---
K
---
Thanks, just cutting into my playing time
---
Why does twitter not ban these accounts .. They wouldn't ddos if no one knows who they are ...
---
Thank you all for your responses. I do have another question. Am I able to res people or heal other people?
---
This happened with me but instead of teaming up, I gank all alliance on sight.  It’s very wholesome.
---
Not anymore. Go quest.
---
is there a cookie cutter talents i spec into?
---
That’s exactly what they’re doing. Big money in cyberattacks-as-a-service. You can buy your very own ransomware attack for like 150 bucks, with you getting 70% of the proceeds. (Please don’t try to do this though, it’s very illegal, very shady, and you’d be dealing with very dangerous groups that run these things)
---
Is it? It is not meant for an experience player as you are. So why are you making such a fuzz about it? What is your problem really?
---
Sure, if you don't wanna have fun discovering the world or questing. Go for it.
---
Well there's at least 2 rppvp servers at least on us.
---
Perchance, precise!
---
Just talking shit about how great my guild is lol
---
if it would be up to me there wont be layering at all. what i toght saying to keep layering is 1-12 zones
---
I don't have the experience that it's terribly contested. Skinning market is very oversaturated ATM. For mining and herbs you need to be aware that you very likely have to do a few grind sessions because you don't get enough levels(in the profession) from normal questing. And if you take herb and mining, you can only show one on the minimap at once.
---
Eh, I'd say one, but she doesn't really count. She plays retail, logged into Classic once, saw that the quests weren't showing up on the map then logged out. Everyone else is still playing.
---
Ya. When you get mind control. Also priests are the missing link for warriors rogues and many others. Grouping helps you make tank friends and keeps things interesting while wands are so strong. If you get too sick of it to continue you can spec blackout+spirit tap when you get mindflay use rank1 for procs and just accept occasional drinking until you can stack enough spirit.
---
Wouldn't it be chaotic neutral because he's not actually causing harm?
---
oh jeez i actually feel bad for her and she should just leave him. i hope theyre only teenagers...
---
Me and my friend can only login to character selection, we dc in loading screen. Anyone else?
---
but server crashes are part of the classic experience
---
Unless its grey, auction EVERYTHING.
---
Scrape the page?
---
I hope i'm wrong
---
What kind of wolf!?
---
Holding space makes you float to the surface.
---
Lying about what? It’s not a problem. 
---
Like they said people are making it out to be a bigger problem then it is like you are.
---
If you value time then you min-max. Why would I want to raid with say shadow priests instead of mages and spend 20-30% more time in a boring ass raid?
---
...out of zero.
---
Just drag an item from your inventory to the bottom of the letter.
---
Seriously. We have a bunch of new players who know nothing about how vanilla wow was bitching about everything. "Stop doing things I didn't think of!"
---
What I usually do for locked chests: 
---
1. Pick the lock with autoloot turned off
---
2. Take the money and health potions from the chest as "payment" for opening it
---
3. If there's any greens/blues, I link them in the chat so people know what they're rolling for, then back away from the chest.
---
4. /roll winner gets the rest of the chest contents.
---
Every rogue is different though. Some leave everything in the chest for the /roll winner, some keep the whole chest to themselves. I don't know if my approach is fair, but I'd like to get something for unlocking the chest in the first place.
---
I’ve explored lots don’t worry! Where do you suggest questing around lvl 25?
---
 The problem is all of you sitting around contemplating the move… nothing is going to change while you all sit on your hands. If you move, the server pop will increase therefore other guilds will see this and be less hesitant. Do you all really want to sit around in twice as long queues when layering is removed in phase two? You are crazy to think that blizzard has alternative solutions.
---
It’s very obvious that a lot of guilds are scouting out the server, a lot of level 1 characters created today and haven’t leveled. Server has had 3k characters either moved or created.
---
Make the move so that other less confident groups will follow
---
I’m just so excited about classic that everyone needs to feel it. You get an int buff! And you get an int buff!
---
i really like that. i feel like they are too out of the way to use for actual abilities but for emotes and group/raid they are perfect. thank you
---
1 out 10
---
I rolled undead male just for the cast animation.  Rest is whatever.
---
Holy shit. This is peak scriptkiddie.
---
Idiots dont even know how to find a server's IP?
---
No, it was too powerful. My voidwalker loses aggro way too easily and I find myself facetanking everything, but wasn't able to fear without pulling three nearby mobs and had negligible healing. In general I'm not a fan of pet classes anyway, and to play at Max level is just shadow bolt spam. Sounded like something I wouldn't enjoy.
---
Nobody is going to offer proof that can get them banned. 
---
The no proof argument makes no sense because of this.
---
Good luck with that, you’re gonna be like 5th priority for it at best
---
Timing slams isn't lazy lol
---
^^ actually true, I love my warrior
---
Based on the prices I've been getting on the auction house, I am willing to offer you 6 gold for that.
---
Streamers brought them back.
---
The kiddies think its funny to watch the streamers rage.
---
I played a ton the first two days hoping to get ahead of the curve.  Then life happened.  Finally got back to it, went from level 28 when 30 was the highest level on the server to now only 32 and people are 60.  RIP.
---
Note that the Paladin mace is amazing and the quest is fun but not worth.  I spent at least an hour soloing the first party of SFK and at least another hour just getting there.
---
I personally have avoided bag mods like this because I’d rather see the giant square lol. Thanks for sharing the image.
---
Why don't you just suck his dick already m8
---
This is purely for threat while leveling and does not account for trying to contribute damage while tanking (rotation is much more dynamic if you want to parse and tank)
---
Try to have rage for at least one sunder before taunting anything. (taunt resists are prevalent on this client)
---
1-3 mobs tab through with sunder armor and revenge. I generally stack two quick sunders on skull mark before starting to tab through. If you get extra rage throw some demo shouts and heroics In there for good measure.
---
4-7mobs if you can, try to use charge and switch to berserker during animation to use berserker rage and immediately go to defensive. This will give you a LOT of extra rage per dmg taken. Then spam 2-3 demo shouts and sunder/revenge skull a few times and then cycle your sunders. You should have enough rage tanking the full pull to continue to thread demo shouts into sunder cycle.
---
8+ mobs use demo shout and just ab through targets. If you can, use shield block then switch to berserker to use berserker rage and immediately back to defensive to help sustain rage. Continue to spam demo shout and tab through targets for white hits. If you have excess rage then que up cleave where you can.
---
Layering was required. If you played of the first couple days on a high pop server, you’d know the pain of levels 1-20ish. Imagine that, but 6x worse. You would be able to tag anything, and it would lag some players computers because there’s so many other players on screen.
---
And I can agree. Some person on reddit that thought about how the servers can be fixed must’ve thought about it way more than a multi-million dollar company that regularly makes these games. I’m sure they invested no time whatsoever making the game. I mean, it’s just vanilla right lol?
---
And as said, who cares if you’re in a dead realm with people abusing it? It’s like seeing someone with a nice car from sucking dick up their way of the corporate ladder. Don’t complain about them having bad morals, just enjoy your life as is.
---
FYI: One of the modern WoW interface innovations that has been back-ported to Classic is the "interact with target" key bind. It's pretty great for getting around this kind of griefing.
---
DDOS protection for an MMO is tough.
---
We dont know yet. It depends on how the population grows
---
0 / 0
---
Well if they'll really end up cycling through all realms, RIP to everyone who spent most of today waiting in a que.
---
The appropriate level zones.
---
The game isn't some kinda of puzzle or mystery...
---
Got this for $550 about six months ago, looks like it's $600 now. I play on the "classic" settings and haven't looked back. Game runs buttery smooth and doesn't get too hot. I'm sure you could crank up the graphics and bit and not lose any performance. 
---
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075FLBJV7/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_5b-CDbEXP916T
---
It is glorious. I went through the yeti cave in Hillsbrad without being ganked by a random squad of 5 one time. Glorious.
---
And the problem is?
---
150+ enchant should be in stonetalon mountains,  sun something retreat. Its an orc up on a hill near  that outpost.
---
There’s a ton of players everywhere at this point. 6x those players would not be an enjoyable experience for anyone.
---
There is money at stake when DDOSING happens.
---
No money in child molesters.
---
Man, people get jail time for that? I play OSRS as well and various players/pvp clans have DDOS'd the servers with no repercussions by Jagex. Glad blizz has a history of pursuing these law breakers.

My buddies and I left Thalnos for Netherwind the other day. Solid server so far. Population seems healthy and the mix of horde and alliance looks pretty equal. There’s also a pretty cool discord for the server and they planned is a pvp battle Hillsbrad tonight.
---
Do not do this lol

We had one in my guild. We made fun of him
---
The game offers you a choice. They choose to abuse it - this is not the games fault, its their
---
Someone’s mad that he has to play resto end game
---
Finally someone who gets it! Must protect the mana!  This is my new mantra.
---
What Addons are you using!?
---
I only care about beefy 5 layers
---
Water Breathing is ALWAYS the go to buff!
---
I think it should be bannable
---
Hilarious you think that's actually how it works
---
I made a Tauren druid called "tankingbull" on launch. Literally got about 5 whispers in the first hour of people harassing me and saying I would never tank.
---
I agree it's not a meme spec but the stigma is definitely there and many people are still uneducated.
---
That list isn't very helpful. There's no indicator for alliance/horde only wands (such as gnomish sapper), and there's no indicator for shadow damage wands. Once you have shadow weaving, you'll want exclusively shadow damage wands (unless an alternative wand has &gt; 15% higher dps).
---
Or maybe people who have experienced classic for what it was are enjoying doing something different.
---
Lmao hilarious logic
---
im at work and twitter is blocked. can you post what is says?
---
You don't think Blizzard game devs are watching all of the data roll in on quests completed, time played, etc ... That is something that doesn't make sense.
---
I'll check it out! i'm logging in today during peak hours and if the que isnt too bad my sword is yours we shall put them in their place &lt;3
---
That’s what I’m saying, fishing definitely seems worth it. Mainly because of Alch, but this is for the cooking part.
---
Since I have little experience I’m curious if it’s good? What food buffs are “worth it”?
---
Is there an addon available that will add /who to the right click menu? I tried searching everywhere but I cant find anything. Or maybe theres an in game setting? I feel like more people would want this.
---
Do not go to Kalimdor - it appears to be down in some way. 
---
Stay in Eastern Kingdoms, at least for now, if you can.
---
Always round up
---
It covers everything you could want for a bag.
---
What a cool person
---
I tried the free trial of retail wow a year ago. Almost didn't try classic due to my experience. I ended up playing 5 straight hours of classic last night and made a buddy to quest with. I don't think I'm ever going to play retail wow.
---
Found the alliance player, or is it you play on a carebear server?
---
Is shadow priest any good in solo world pvp?
---
A take so dumb that it’s amusing so I won’t try to change your mind.
---
Report the PoS.
---
how the f....
---
they don't have minimum req'd levels but that's roughly the level you'd get it at doing the quests. 
---
I recommend this list though, much better: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTm4F0MKf-HFEhHV7RjCS-MmQOFKinmXLNKMVC1N1RILG80RwtSQmAewGs0glOt2GMle9hRdbdTrUG2/pubhtml#
---
Because it affects me and other players
---
It is the games fault. They could have prevented this but chose not to.
---
I like it
---
So, an Alliance player?
---
DDos attack
---
What ui is that?
---
underrated comment
---
Just get Leatrix Plus and it'll get rid of error messages for you (among many other incredibly useful options) ;)
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Did he lose to level 17 druids on his 25 hunter after opening on them fighting mobs, too?
---
What zones are you in?  I’m still pretty low lvl.  Just went through Durotar to lvl up herb to 65 and it went pretty fast.  Debating whether to just wait for mount though for future leveling.
---
I think all my friends who are borderline kinda fading already are 20 or lower and maybe have run one dungeon (RFC).
---
Got ddosed
---
A true forsaken would have eaten his corpse...
---
It's simple starting over popularity. Blizzard already got all the data they needed to see about this from private server Developers
---
They know that the population spikes and valleys will follow a similar trajectory as it did 15 years ago, with each expansion, only at an accelerated rate.
---
I like how it says "when" and not "if" she devorces me.
---
Fakenews, no proof
---
In EU it’s still big. OP is probably from Europe
---
Would you still be laughing if it were a woman?
---
None. There are about 9 of us. No plans of stopping anytime soon.
---
No iidea what caused it then. I tried to make a new char buy same thing happened, stuck on loading screen.
---
Skinning Knife with +15 agility, and cloth lvl 1 boots with run speed
---
This is what I do. My UI looks fairly similar to this, but it switches during a raid so the frames are much much smaller.
---
Benediction always welcomes more Alliance
---
42 sword rogue, been beaten on dps by literally 1 person ever, a lock 6 levels above me in Uldaman.  Literally was only ever an arena junkie, my raiding experience ends at LFR
---
Shamans aren’t good, everyone in these pug groups is just really bad.
---
Hits harder than the Ww axe
---
I love support classes. I thought for this time I should play a damage dealer. So I leveled a rogue to 60 and instantly made a shaman alt. I couldn't shake off the feeling that I just wanted to support my team and be helpful but as a rogue without high enough lock picking I couldn't do anything it felt like. Now I'll take it slower, enjoy healing and questing with my friends.
---
I've skilled improved demo shout and spamming it over and over again. I swear it's more effective than anything I've done on private. After around 3-4 shouts I shieldblock+ revenge. Then cleave/heroic &amp; sunder armor. Inbetween demo shout... sounds noobish, but I swear it works..
---
Taps the wallet.
---
If you think when a rogue says roll for chest we roll, someone wins but takes the loot then brags about it is right then you're as bad as him hilarious
---
Does this apply to argent dawn as well for healing to braces?
---
That's right but they eventually will. There are some players (not incl popular streamers) that are sitting on hundreds of gold within the first two weeks so it won't be long. This is AH behaviour brought over from retail; this person just starts as they mean to go on.
---
you're just salty
---
A woman hacker? Yes.
---
Sadly my coworker invited his two friends to our guild, and I found out the hard way they were 30 lives with mommy never touched a woman call everyone a retard type fellas. Had to gkick them and talk with my coworker that he needs better friends. He took it pretty well.
---
How?
---
Out of curiousity, does she not want to use Questie to display quests? Or does she not like addons?
---
People dont know how to warrior tank though.. Think spamming demo is good enough.. 2 out of the last 4 tanks I've had in SM didnt even use sunder armor, despite me telling them why they should . :(
---
Your only way to “heal” people would be for them to use the healthstone which you’ve provided to them. Same goes for ressing. You will have to provide them with your soulstone, before they die, for them to activate it and ress, when they die.
---
If you’re low level and building towards it, I would put earlier stuff in arms. You need the talent in arms that lets you keep fury from switching stances. Literally required to do anything low leveled (stance dancing makes the game much easier for warriors.)
---
After you get that, but some points into the row 1 fury critical hit talent. Then you can just go whatever from there. Shouldn’t matter too much.
---
Stonetalon mountains, ashenvale, barrens.
---
Off tanking is actually pretty fun. Did it for my guild from wrath through legion and had a blast. MTd the fights where my class was better but mostly always OT. It's actually a pretty low stress role and you have a guaranteed raid spot.
---
I filled in the 20-35 quest holes with dungeon runs for some gear. Not xp grinds mind you, just running them for a full quest run and grinding armory for the axe drop.
---
If you are a rogue or Druid you can absolutely get all of your cauldrons solo without fighting anything. There are only a few spawns that work, but just doing a rotation for a little while will get the job done.
---
Excellent work.
---
I stopped a fleeing Nelf Rogue last night after he tried to gank someone and managed to sprint and leave combat. Ran right into a Concussive Shot and a Cheap Shot.
---
Kirtonos too just got kicked
---
Ya but ... Any jackass can DDOS, it's not hard to do in the slightest, you need only a handful of programs that are crazy easy to find, and that's about it. It's just the most traceable shit in the world and doesn't actually accomplish basically anything. If they were actually going in with purpose that'd be one thing, but sounds like they're just time wasters wanting attention
---
Do it
---
yes its the strongest class 1v1 with enough skill and engi tools u can 1vX too
---
Lol as a horde player, I would have to disagree.  Paladins have always been the ones that gank the most when you’re a low lvl.  They love to wait until you’re low health fighting something and throw that 6 sec stun on you
---
Good think you aren't a GM then
---
It's worth it if you feel like it's worth it and there is literally no other metric which you can measure worth by
---
I mean you could also measure worth by what other people tell you is valuable but that's kind of stupid
---
I think a lot of new players don't understand that you have to zone hop in Vanilla. People run out of quests in a particular zone, and say fuck it, I guess I'm forced to spam SM graveyard until my eyes bleed like I see everyone else doing.
---
Where did you happen to read that.
---
focus on your kid more and less on bitching about wow, tool.
---
It's like they just found a 2000s warez site with basic ddos tools.
---
This reminds me of a certain Perri Piper video...
---
Yeah can't log on either. Have an alt on Benediction and just got booted from that too
---

---
More are down...just started looting chest and world goes down:)
---
Havent fought for mining nodes at all really since launch.
---
Mining tends to be ok money from start to finish.
---
Low level herbs tend to be near worthless, midlevels tend to be ok and then really expensive at 60.
---
Skinning values are usually very low on AH because very few people opt to level LW. You do tend to get a lot more than you need when youre skinning as well, a lot of the time you might even end up vendoring it, but its still decent money.
---
Bloodsail went down too.
---
Grats!
---
I've got the boots, legs, and chest here at level 23.  I'm about to ding level 24 though so I feel like soon people will stop letting me group up.  Hopefully I get the last 2 sets before I hit 25.
---
Magister's was intended to be harder than the other heroics though, it was released with Sunwell and had a lot of catch-up gear that was on para with Kara epics.
---
Omg help!
---
Yeah, but I can't discern any feature except maybe the black hair. No idea where the head, arms, nody, feet, weapon are.
---
Even Retail servers are down. Likely DDOS attack.
---
Kromcrush down too
---
I can't login to any server rn.
---
If he literally had to ask twitter for the Faerlina IP I give it less than 48 hours before the fbi is at his door or he's being arranged for extradition.
---
Lets not post anyone potential criminal's social media page. Mods pls delete any posts about whoever is claiming to have done this.
---
Well, I had to log anyway! Ty DDOSers ;-)
---
Eh I thought it was a forever alone joke. Like WoW Classic &gt; Coitus
---
i wanted to play warlock but i didnt want to play orc
---
It sounds to me like you're doing everything I did. I admit when I was around your level I think I had around the same amount as you, maybe a little more, and I didn't think it was possible to get the 100g in time. But as you level more the quests give you more money, the vendor items are worth more, and you'll find BoEs that are also going for 1g or more at times. It ramps up pretty fast as you get closer to 40. Keep doing what you're doing and I think you'll be ok 🙂
---
To the hordies who helped this dude get his we axe:  you disgust me race traitors
---
Don't flag for pvp or don't roll on a pvp server if you don't want your time wasted.
---
Shouts used to be worth so much threat! It's honestly one of the best abilities we have!
---
Cant even Log in to Server.  I can make it to Realm List however.
---
US-Mankrik
---
can't log into sulfuras either code WOW51900102
---
Same on Thalnos
---
I mean, you said it yourself. Either everyone has to go through Azeroth to the dungeon or 2 people have to (summoning stone) or no one has to (LFD). I don't see how you can argue that the dungeon finder **doesn't** reduce the number of people travelling through Azeroth to dungeons. I mean, you literally had to but now you don't.
---
Thunderfury is up. I think the big servers are getting DDOS'd
---
Ashkandi too :(
---
micro p\*\*\*S syndrome spotted
---
r/whoosh 
---
Bro you are making this too easy
---
I've actually just been waiting for my friend to hit 30 so we can hit STV together. I tried solo but the horde are like a fucking plague in there.
---
Very high skill class here
---
As the others said, WotF. Stun resist is nice but it's only an increased chance, while WotF is guaranteed to break fears and charms, which are much more dangerous in Classic than they are in retail.
---
Haha :) We dont use DKP tho, loot council instead.
---
This is what I've heard as well.
---
Confirmed booted. Can't relog. All I wanted to do was hearth before work.
---
Do you have a link?
---
I have been using Spirit Tap. I can normally get a last hit or two per pull with just wand spam. I only normally only have to stop a drink a few times per dungeon.
---
Oooof
---
Happening to me too
---
So go into Leatrix Maps and uncheck 'Reveal unexplored areas'.  Really, it's not that difficult.  All the Leatrix Maps settings are optional.  Nothing is forced.
---
Oof, looks like its retail servers as well.  Figured i'd go on and do a firelands  run since im a couple weeks away from the legendary staff on my ancient warlock....but i cant get on there, either.
---
There’s 6 layers per realm. The players are split up between these 6 layers. This is how the layering works. If you got rid of the layering, you would see all the people at once.
---
Mankrik too
---
Pagle is fine.
---
The funny thing is my experience on Mograine has been that almost all Alliance are very friendly and civilized. In all my playtime up to level 46 I've been attacked a total of 4 times and it's usually the Horde, who are the initiators of PvP, but good luck and give the people a damn name so they can help you!
---
Yup can’t log into server
---
:(
---
server restart in 15:00
---
Gnomes got tired of targeting ashenvale and started targeting the servers directly
---
Kalimdor is down right now. Try make an Undead character and it'll work.
---
NOOOOOO
---
What is this "Earth" that you speak of?
---
Herod seems down as well
---
Man I did the exact same thing except that I helped the Alliance get the mob down to about 90%, then killed the shit out of them and got the mob kill credit when the tag dropped.
---
What a small world!
---
Doesn't really explain why so many of us got DCed in the first place though
---
To be fairrrrr
---
People that do this shit should be flayed.
---
The end result is perfect imo, You never really think "man if I just had 2 more points". You get to grab everything, it's all just so good that you want it first.
---
ddos
---
doesnt this share the same CD as pvp trinket?
---
I think the reason why druid isn't the main tankbis because their leather gear doesn't have defense stat, which makes them getting crit from bosses, that's why it's a good offtank, maybe better than warr. And also druid is good for dungeon too. Also MC and Ony ia easy, you don't need gear for that. BWL and Naxx is just a massive gearcheck and that's why druid can't maintank there (but off is viable)
---
Every server is having issues right now.
---
Server is down
---
yes
---
Can't log into any game servers right now. Says im disconnected every time.
---
When one guy can take down blizzards servers....
---
I have no idea, might be the same addon, or OmniCC maybe.
---
Whitemane was like 1.5 hours on peak time Friday night.
---
Not that bad
---
Servers are getting DDOSED
---
There's literally like 3 posts in the front page about it, it's a ddos group.  
---
  Can you guys fucking take 2 seconds to check the front page instead of instantly making like 12 threads
---
Ya I just got DC'ed and can't connect as well
---
Gratz!
---
That's a massive achievement. Not easy to collect all the pieces.
---
How many runs did it take ?
---
Stalaag here, also having DC issues
---
Pretty sure you can macro the targets target as the subject of a spell, so that would include wand attacking.
---
everyone panic
---
I agree... I worry my post came across too negative. I'm not sure it is bad, just a thought
---
Yeah I’m trying to get back on but it keeps disconnecting me after I select my realm.
---
Can't get back on Stalagg. Goes to logging in to game server, stays there for a bit, then just disconnects. Before I got kicked people asking about lag so I'm guessing something happened.
---
I went disc golfing yesterday afternoon and ended up hanging with people in real life straight till today. The exp waste is not worth it!
---
First ufc lightweight champ, Jens Pulver plays on that server.
---
Most of the servers are down.
---
Yep, I got a few good twink items leveling. Sold them low. “Nobody” has gold to throw around yet.
---
Same here trying to log onto Sulfuras. I can log onto other servers though
---
Same with Deviate Delight
---
I guess you should never get any res, buff, group invite or assist out in the while then.  After all, you didn't pay for it.

Can't play, well time to drink and go meet a hooker.

Same issue on Kirtonos, shits broke

Yes. It's called the Paladin Police Force.

I too just got kicked off of Benediction. Barrens chat was fun while that was happening.

Same here. Strange, I can login in other servers and create a new char, but I can't login in Kromcrush. Wonder why.

I don't think I have been attacked by alliance once yet, where they didn't have a big advantage. Level, numbers, hp, etc.

Alliance are actual scum.

That’s correct but you have to consider that socialism is a bit of a spectrum that varies, so while nazis were anti-communism unlike most socialists, they were still anti-capitalism landing them on the socialist spectrum.

Ooooh I had no idea. I always make gibberish names for throwaway toons and it works.... this one just pinged as taken

I got Feet of the Lynx (leather twink item) on day 2 and they have steadily increased in price from 4g when I got them to 30g today. You're just wrong, so that's cool.

It's not about having to melee, it's about using the free dps increase you get by using your melee on top of your ranged weapons

There’s a very big difference between a DOS (Denial of Service) and a DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service). Those handful of programs will let you launch a single computer attack, which typically just floods a single port or a handful of ports with ICMP data, which back in the day was enough to knock a computer or a single server offline. This is a DOS attack, and nowadays are pretty ineffective for all but the most basic attacks, like knocking a player out of a game by flooding the ports on his IP that his game uses. A Distributed attack uses thousands, if not tens of thousands and in some rare cases, millions of devices, all targeting an IP or a group of IPs... these types of attacks can overwhelm typical DOS prevention tactics, and can be very costly to run, and defend against. These attack devices are almost always compromised devices spread around the world, that have been taken over typically with worming malware that exploits vulnerabilities in the host OS code, that are then checking in with Command and Control servers awaiting activation to attack whatever target the bot net owner wishes. 
---
I actually teach this stuff (and sell software and hardware that helps stop and protect against it), and it’s easy to mix up the classic script kiddie stuff with the big stuff. The big stuff (Exploits-as-a-service, ransomware-as-a-service, botnets-for-hire for examples) is a multi billion dollar industry that is run by organized crime and rogue nation-state actors (think Russian mafia, Fancy Bear, North Korea, and countless more).
---
Well I for one am happy to see you!
---
It's very easy to roll up the wow client, capture your packets and... Oh wait expose yourself by buying a sub. Yeah asking is the way to go.
---
Not sure why all the negativity, I was 8 when I was proud of myself :(

Example of those "literal white nationalists"?

so at first i should focus on having int+ spirit? or is stamina as important as spirit? If you can explain me how spirit works i would appreciate it

---
I don't understand why you're being downvoted. You made it clear you were already questing. If there's obviously a Warlock waiting at the dungeon entrance with other people, why bother getting on a flight? I play lock myself and I only give people a hard time about being summoned when we're both equal distance from the instance and they just want to wait around for me to do the traveling.
---
Any addon that makes people say stuff (readable by players) should be blocked and made bannable. Especially addons that gives everyone a map-wide alarm whenever stealth is de- /activated.
---
Yes, UK or elsewhere, they can still be extradited
---
I think the general consensus is that once the hype around WoW Classic dies down in a few weeks, a ton of players are gonna end up going back to retail and the low pop servers will have to either merge with other servers or become ghost towns. Go to a high pop server if you want crowded cities.
---
Nope, i had not. That works, thanks!
---
Because I like staring at bear butt. UwU
---
Good thing it wasn't a Tauren alliance player :D
---
robe of the arcana, pretty rare pattern, needed for warlocks to get their class quest robe
---
You in the goldshire inn?
---
How dare you try and teach me shit!
---
How do you mean?
---
why give this loser attention?
---
Listen to me mate I just like treasure so much that I can spot it a few hundred feet away, you got a problem with that?
---
The OwO stuff didn’t exist in 2005 so I’m gonna go with no, this is just another weirdo.
---
Yea the only direction you go slower is backpedaling so best to learn not to do that.
---
Yeah I dunno, it’s pretty crazy especially given the toon name.
---
Where is this? It’s beautiful
---
Problem with the Skinning knife is that it doesn't actually count as a weapon, so equipping it is going to block a lot of weapon skills.
---
Made that mistake on my hunter. "&lt;At level 5 or so&gt; OH hey, lol. This Skinning knife is better than the quest reward I just got. &lt;A Few Moments Later&gt; Hey, why wont it let me Raptor Strike?"
---
He's a regular on T_D and KotakuInAction. Don't expect much.
---
If a boe world epic drops every 160k kills and a million people are playing, you're gonna see 6 boe epics every time that million each kill a mob. Simple math :-)
---
I did the same thing with a group. We wiped except one warlock. We were running back and he said he was going to get a drink, so I asked if he could grab some for me too because I was out.
---
Turns out he was talking about IRL, we had a good laugh about it too.
---
Ret pally demo ofc
---
In my experience the imp runs out of mana too quick.
---
This means we've arrived. When angry losers in their basements attack the pastimes of happy losers in their basements, that means you're part of the zeitgeist!
---
Guys, we'd actually be cool if this wasn't WoW!
---
Shift click seems to be hit and miss for me. Sometimes it just doesn't work.
---
He could get a hold of them without ever owning the game, my dear friend. Even without asking. Are you possibly the owner of the twitter account?
---
Step 1: Mark priority target.   
---
Step 2: Mark targets to utilise all CC available to your team.   
---
Step 3: Let Jesus take the wheel when your DPS ignore all of this.
---
I'm confused. If they patched it before, why isn't it patched in classic? Or is this clip before a classic WoW patch?
---
People like this are scumbags.
---
thank you!
---
Westfall is back up and I'm playing just fine now
---
What is healing predictions?
---
That's pretty dissapointing. I would not have healed him for sure. I only had one jerk mage so far who said "go fk yourself, buy your own food needy rogue" lol I'm so nice about it too ah well, must be new to alliance
---
Dud you lose it
---
no, but on new realms the few lvl 60s all know anything that is to be known of other lvl 60 guilds, after all, by definition, they spend most of the day playing the game for 2 weeks running, otherwise they couldn't technically be in those guilds that already raid.  So ALL significant drops and achievements of these guilds are well  known.  The game doesn't need an official track record for that.
---
(this will change obviously once dozens if not hundreds of guilds start raiding)
---
"yeah I know I'm getting killed at the moment, but THE AESTHETIC!"
---
Hey man, take a breather. You're getting way too worked up over people not getting a joke.
---
He asked for evidence!
---
I guess so. Too many people think realism is the only way games can be beautiful though, to the point they think FFXIV looks better than wow when it technically doesn't even come close. (I play both. Well, played. Classic has taken overrrr.)
---
Are you ok
---
He said the ddos was false meaning it didn’t happen. I’ve seen the tweets so I assume it’s a ddos. I’m asking why he’s so sure it’s not true
---
No. He should have said nothing, bought them himself, and re-listed for 1.5g. THAT is how economies work.
---
So that's why wikipedia didn't work yesterday...
---

The real problem is people think of in retail terms ... Certain specs can be played as adps/support role very effectively. I'd argue most specs are capable of raiding if people take their head out of their asses. I'm not saying ret or Shadow would be a good idea though...
---
Weapon chain doesn’t hurt
---
Uh-huh, so you're wrong since they managed to bring the ENTIRE THING DOWN not just a single port, and it was a full takedown of it. Don't give a shit about your essay since you're arguing with someone that saw it first hand lol
---
Its not checking a button.  Its collecting enough money every month to hire an army of programmers.
---
I mean sure, but then again SS doesn’t reset swing timer, only sword spec does. So there would be a 7% chance per MH swing for this to matter, and if you say on average you lose half your MH swing due to not considering swing timer, it would result in a 3.5% dps loss from MH white hits, and since about 35% of your DPS is from MH white hits it would reduce your total DPS by about 1.2%.
---
not for almost, it is for the entirety of classic.
---
True. I'm an average player that is around lvl 30 (26 in fact).

Game is fun in the short term. In the long term retail will easily eclipse this in terms of active player base.
---
To change your autoattack to wanding vs melee... i've been wandering this too. Literally have no use for melee as a warlock.

Lighting is the reason everyone thought andromeda looked bad. I agree, lighting is super super important and we take it for granted when it's done well and know something is off when it's bad.

How do you handle auto attacks with this macro setup? /startattack runs into character limits on the majority.

Whole heatedly suggest Hunter starting out. It is easy to get going, but later on as you get better it's high skill cap will let you grow. One thing you will need a lot of keybinds. If you run out of room at level 60 consider getting a gaming keyboard. Tame a pig as your main pet and don't forget you pet has skills (slingshot icon) I've seen a lot of untrained pets.

Yall act like they dont collect 50 million a month from people. They could hire the worlds largest army of programmers with that money.

You can use a site like sixtyupgrades.com to find bis at a given level, but I wouldn't bother with it. Just focus on leveling and use WoWHead to search for a new weapon every so often if you're a physical damage class.

What's script kiddies trying to flex with a DDOS attack. They must have bearly discovered hackforums

Where is that vendor 55 food?
---
this kind of guild runs a loot council..
---
Because as of right now people literally do not leave the dungeon. They log out at the nearest inn and when they're back they go right back to the dungeon.
---
Doesn’t really matter at this level lol. You’re not using a raid dps rotation jeez 😂
---
I can see that.   however a tip to someone who does a service you can't is a big part of classic
---
IIRC dungeons don't have lockouts or if they do they're something like 5 runs per hour
---
The higher your level, the easier it is to earn gold but the more things cost.
---
At level 10, 100g seems impossible. At level 60, it's possible for some classes to earn that much in an hour.
---
To get the epic mount, all you really have to do is spend some time focused on earning gold and stop spending it in everything else until you have your mount.
---
I can usually beat people with target macros with my Arcane explosion, my friends who were using target macros gave up because I was always beating them to the tag. But it's stressful because I'm just focusing super hard, and the second something spawns I tag it. Target macros require 2 "casts" to tag (the target macro is an instant cast with no GCD), while you just have to be standing close enough to the mob with arcane explosion. It seems there is also an extremely short window where something visually begins to spawn, but is not immediately targetable.

It's all custom, no UI. Just Bartender, recount, bagnon, buffwatch weak auras for castbars, I'll be adding more weak auras when I see some fitting for me. I might actually make some for aoe tanking
---
When I pvp as a druid in early lvls, is it better to be in bear or in cat form?
---
The inn isn't in the dungeon. It's out in the world. So when they are going back to the dungeon they are going... through Azeroth. Which they wouldn't be doing if there were LFD.

Gear doesn’t solve Ret’s issues. If you mean that a highly geared ret paladin will 1v1 other classes with fresh 60 gear then I mean sure.
---
Hah, no. You're likely to be 60 for a long time before you get your epic mount. It's an achievement, not a requirement.

Talents in holy help to hold aggro. 
---
Talents in protection don't stop you from "melting fast".  There's talents like "Increase shield block rate after being crit." "Increase damage absorbed by block by 30%" 
---
You have to recognize that in classic talent trees were not "specs" like they were later, even in TBC.  
---
Paladins can tank.  They're not warriors, but they can tank.  Ret, prot AND holy all offer tools for paladins that work in different ways, and tanking is part of the class that all 3 trees support.
---
Holy is about increasing holy damage, increasing your ability to cast, and mana.
---
Protection is about reacting to being hit, taking less damage, stuns, and using a one hander. 
---
Retribution is about empowering your attacks while weakening your enemies. 
---
None of these are the "damage spec", the "healing spec" or the "tank spec" like they became. 
---
For instance, something like Deflection is in the retribution tree.  It's more of a tank skill, but it's in Retribution because it's a martial skill and it's not shield based. Vindication reduces the damage that your opponents deal, again, that's not a DPS skill, but it reduces incoming damage, but since it afflicts the target rather than buffing the paladin's defenses it's more retribution than protection. 
---
Guardian's favor as a tank skill isn't really meaningful, you should be holding aggro, and you shouldn't be BoPing yourself, it's more of a support or even healer ability. Improved Concentration Aura would be something that would benefit a healer more, but it's in protection because it's an protective augmentation. 
---
Improved Seal of Righteousness is pretty meaningful from a threat perspective in Holy given the way that Righteous Fury works. Same with Consecration being incredibly highly valued. The way that mana works as a paladin tank means Divine Intellect and Improved Blessing of Wisdom are valuable.  Holy Shock also has a good amount of value as a threat tool.
---
Now, I would argue that if you're struggling with threat, improved Righteous Fury is a big deal, but there's a lot in the protection tree that you don't strictly need.  When you get to 40, holy shield is pretty useful, but holy shock can fill in if you do decide to go holy, and it gives you flexibility in roles.
---
What I would suggest though is if you're gonna tank, please find people who aren't dicks to play with.  It will make your life easier, and they won't blame you for their own mistakes. 
---
You can tank with talents leaning towards any of the 3 specs, and you can do well, especially if you make smart decisions to support the roles you are filling.  The most survivable tank spec is going to be protection, and there's some threat tools there too.  However, the difference between them is not near as big as OP is making it out to be.
---
Rather, DPS need to pay attention to threat, especially with a paladin tank, even if they're perfectly specced.  The game is not designed around the tank always only taking damage, and in classic everyone CAN take a hit and is actually expected to from time to time. Paladins actually are great when it comes to AoE threat relative to other tanks, but struggle on single target threat. 
---
Dropping consecration to pick up improved hammer of justice won't make this better.
---
thats a sick suggestion, never knew it existed, ty for that!
---
&gt;Nobody is getting 8 years for DDOSing.

True, I didn't really look at their Twitter. Honestly they're probably weren't even the ones to have taken down Wikipedia and just want to get cred or something.
---
Ashkandi is up. I just logged in
---
Fairlina is also attacked, where all the Streamers are usually located.
---
Neither is good evidence. The surveys here aren’t remotely reliable data. No matter how large the sample size, if it’s not a random sample or very close, it’s no good.
---
Prot Paladin vs. Bear is similar to Warrior vs. Bear, as Prot Paladins can become uncrushable, have superior AoE tanking abilities (especially with a shield), and can take liberal advantage of melee weapon chance-on-hit procs. One of which (Shadowstrike) just so happens to have a self-heal component that scales with +spelldam, and so (if the proc can be spellbatched enough) would provide a large amount of self-healing to the Paladin even while holding a shield. Again, you and I still don't know everything yet. Are you just trying to get people to stop testing Prot Paladin?
---
I hear you. About the aggro: some people opt for the demonology tree for the VW aggro talent just for that purpose.
---
I played Warlock myself in vanilla back in the 2005 days. It fit me perfectly then.
---
Now I play a Druid. So I really understand your switch to Shaman. Very satisfying to be able to heal and use supporting totems. Movement speed and the overall atmosphere of the class is so nice if it suits you.
---
I made my original comment more as a jest, and your answer made your point clear. :D

It's a DDOS attack.

Ashkandi is up

Aside from Will of the Forsaken, it's likely because they want to play Horde but they want to play the most human-like race.

Can't really distribute a game server so you'll always have a bottleneck you can try to flood.

I wouldnt complain, i would found funny that every character having power like the Bronze Drake Flight would have a "Classic" notice

Nope. There's no achievement system, which means that you achieve the things you want to do instead of doing lots of stuff you don't care about to try to earn achievement points.

The eagles shouldn’t really qualify as this considering they’re written in far ahead of time and have relevance in other situations.
---
Jokes on you. We get a free mount at 40 and use it to farm up riding and mount for epic riding. Thats the real secret tbh.
---
Apparently some streamer messed with the hackers girl so the hacker is taking down every wow server and Twitch wow streamer with DDOS attacks.  Weird flex.

The snapjaw turtles in The western shores of the alterac mountains  are great for farming.

Its actually the other way around, you have to prove that it is a ddos

AV won't be until phase 3. I'm hoping to have my mount way before AV is available.

By asking players to not layer hop you are also currently asking them to not play the game as efficiently as possible. For those that want to gain as much gear, gold and items as quickly as possible(which is obviously common when it comes to an MMORPG) they are left with no other choice.

So you're suggesting paying for them? When blizzard isn't suggesting charging for them? Also, a personal attack isn't a very convincing argument, dumb fuck :)

---
I'm sorry, how would that expose him? Blizzard has millions of IPs connecting to their servers daily. I'm almost positive this script kiddy is just using a bot farm that he paid for to DDoS whatever. How would Blizzard in any way be able to correlate your personal IP logging into WoW to the thousands of botnet IPs that are used to DDoS? Unless you're using one of your own IPs as part of the attack? In which case the person deserves to be tracked down because that's the dumbest thing a hacker could do. Have you ever heard of a VPN? Are you the owner of the Twitter account? Because it seems like you don't know what you're talking about

Mounts aren't the only things factions have to offer.  Google a faction when you discover it and you should be able to find a list of stuff they sell and how much rep you need.  Could be a weapon, armor, trinket, etc that might help you out.

I doubt this is a big contributor but you should not value agility so low. Agility gives you Crit chance to increases the chance for you to proc flurry for attack speed and also gives dodge chance.

Devouring plague will be cleansed asap or removed with jungle remedy and it costs a literal fuckton of mana. Shadowguard does more damage 1v1 if you are refreshing it and frees up your inner focus for a mind blast, gheal, or SW:P greatly increasing mana efficiency for a class with monumental mana problems.  It also procs blackout very often.
---
WotF is indeed good, but not so much on horde since alliance has fewer warlocks already.  It's better in TBC since there was intra-faction arena.
---
Stop drinking the kool aid, you should try looking at the numbers on your own. Paladins can only become uncrushable by stacking defense only and ignoring other vital stats. AoE tanking is cool, but there's like two or three places in the entire game where it matters. Shadowstrike has low ppm and the proc will mostly end up being irrelevant overhealing. Other chance-on-hit items can at best add a few % to your total TPS output.
---
All of this also ignores the fact that:
---
1)Prot paladins straight up take more damage.
---
2)Prot paladins are succeptible to abilities that target or affect casters.
---
3)Prot paladins have no defensive cooldown.
---
4)Prot paladins have no taunt.
---
5)Prot paladins have no mobility cooldowns.
---
6)Prot paladins waste pot CD on mana.
---
7)Prot paladins contest gear that is better utilized by warriors.
---
Testing is great, misleading people into thinking that the spec has great raiding potential is not.

---
Tailoring goes well with Chanting but it does leave you a bit gold starved because you end up disenchanting everything you make to level it up. End game though, chanting mats are possibly the best and easiest way to farm gold. Yes brack rutus will sell for a ton . . . but its not as easy to farm as greens (and you can make them as well from using your cloth)
---
you can tank in dungeons without any difficulty, and paladin is the best mono-heal in the game that is very liked in raid. 
---
Even as a ret, you can have a place just because of the paladins benedictions and auras.
---
Whatever you want to do, i'd say it's better to go in the holy tree until you reach consecration, which help A LOT for everything, especially tanking.
---
I think grinding 37-40 is one of the best strategies actually. It doesn’t take a ton of time, you can make enough gold for mount plus more, and you can save up all those 37-40 quests to get a boost as soon as you hit 40.
---
Wow! so debate, much argument!
---
At this point, there are few, if any, twinks, so dealing them isn't too difficult.  First, anything you'll be doing that will leave you vulnerable (skinning, herbing, drinking, interacting with a quest npc, etc, etc). Throw a bubble on yourself. By the time weakened soul ends, you should be back at 100% mana (spirit is the #1 stat for lvling priests). 
---
If you're going to fear, fear early. They'll break it, but if you're spec'd for it, you'll have another one in 26 seconds *which they can't do anything about*. I don't usually bother with it, though. Rogues are kinda flimsy. PW: S -&gt; SW: P -&gt; Mind Blast -&gt; Mind Flay -&gt; Mind Flay -&gt; Mind Blast -&gt; Mind Flay -&gt; Mind Flay and dead. If you get into a 2v1, focus the rogue unless the other target is a healer. The longer it lives, the more dangerous it becomes.  
---
Lastly, have two sets. One for healing and one for solo questing. For your healing set, focus on spirit and int, for your questing set focus on spirit and stam. Stam is the best stat for PvP and it puts you out of one-shot territory. You don't really need too much int as your mp5 regen will be massive with spirit tap and high spirit. Especially with the spirit tap procs, so you'll always have 80%+ mana as you grind from mob to mob.

Lastly, but you're probably already doing this, lvl as shadow. Priest are the only actual healing class, the rest are hybrids. If other classes want to be great healers (not just viable, which they can be up to 50+ content with gear), they have to spec into resto or holy. You can stay shadow. You'll be better if you go 30/31 into disc or holy, but you don't have too. You'll just be drinking more. Shadow give you more damage, shadowform (with it's damage resistance), and vampiric embrace. Just make sure to have a dedicated healing set.  
---
If you don't want to be shadow, you MUST have engineering. It give you more damage, space, and time. It also costs you a profession and leveling engineering isn't cheap.  
---
Most importantly, DON'T PANIC. Easier said than done and it comes with experience. Rogues are opportunists. They like to attack you with your pants down. If you panic, you'll make mistakes which is what the rogue is hoping for. Stay calm and burn the little coward down.
---
I think that the roleplaying part of wow is so that you try different roles to pick one that suits you the best.
---
Pure projection dude. I didn't say that. You're making up the details as you go along. I poked fun at his spec because it's sub-optimal and frankly retarded for leveling. I didn't tell him how to play whatsoever. I just expressed my opinion on resto leveling. I'm allowed to do that. And you're allowed to be butthurt about it. All fair. Stop being such a pussy.

W to swim forward.
---
S to paddle backward.
---
Q &amp; E to paddle sideways.
---
Space bar to float to surface.
---
X to dive down.
---
To swim on the surface, right click and look up then hold down W to swim toward it. When you are at the surface, adjust your camera forward and swim normally.
---
Alternatively you can do the same by holding down the left and right mouse buttons at the same time without any keyboard inputs, but once you are at the surface you will want to use W for forward movement.

Rofl you do know what happens if you attack someone in ratchet right? I was in booty bay, then immediately as I left I got killed by a 41 warrior (I was 34). 
---
The Rez point in nearby, so when I Rez i get stunned and hit. He didn’t kill me though, he hit me till 10% hp, slow me, stun me, /laugh. The pathway at stv is small, there’s no other way to go up from booty bay.
---
Also it’s funny you mention hillsbrand, you realise that the zone is like 90% horde right? The reason you never see similar level alliance players there is because they get shat on, so they move to safer zones. The only alliance in that zone are those that want to move up to the mountains.
---
Dude I'm a 45 mage right now, and I was going to do a fury warrior as an alt, but I am OBSESSED with that 11/33/7 Spec. I've stared at it on talent calculators just thinking, I want to play this.

If that’s Rawkus from Dunemaul tell him he’s a bitch boi

This is slightly  iaccurate. Most quests in Hillsbrad Foothills don't even become available until Lev 29,30. 25-35 is more accurate
---
Nah, they just summoned a ziggurat. Took like 50 in-universe seconds.
---
Ah, well they both have that feature anyways and I find TSM is much better anyways - highly recommend giving it a try.

At least they weren’t testing how well bans work by screaming the N word in chat.

Exactly, me too! I think it's easy to look at devouring plague and WotF and think undead are clearly better.  But once you play a troll spriest the gap closes alot.

Download atlasloot.  It has a list of all the dungeons with their level range and you can cycle through each boss to see all the items it could drop.  It wont cover random drops or quest items but it will let you know which dungeons are worth running.  SFK for example has nice belt, shoulders, and robes for clothies.

Go Horde
---
Sounds like it, what server?
---
That’s exactly my logic. Other than a nice thing to do, it just slows the whole run down if we have to wait for resource regen and I’d rather have everyone playing their best. I also don’t like the idea of people having to spend money to play their best outside of a raid setting.
---
They were ddosing twitch west servers yesterday, on got a few streamers to lag out for a few seconds. They celebrated like they killed bin laden.
---
Interesting how if this was posted in r/wow the context would be completely different. Like "wow you only gave him 10 gold for his troubles??"
---
I love this community
---
Sorry if the picture is hard to see haha, the significance is that my name is Echeyakee and I tamed Echeyakee. Took awhile to find Horde willing to help!
---
Thanks! will try
---
I have a friend that's playing a warrior. I want to level with them but I can't decide what class.  I need to catch up a bit... Soloing as priest sounds very boring.  I've started a paladin but it's not that interesting as a solo either.  I am tempted by the versatility of druid.
---
Also, whenever BGs get put in, we will pvp there.
---
Should I go with druid, priest, or stick with pally?
---
Because you don't get invited to mage/lock only aoe groups as a rogue unfortunately.

---
I’m fine with a PvP scrap but damn I’ll hold a grudge if you try to keep me away from my quest objectives and gank me while I’m fighting mobs. The extreme consequences of PvP should enforce good behavior lol
---
Thank you. Do you recommend install it through twitch?
---
Ah yes, Shattrath and Shadow Lab, the classic vanilla experience.
---
I’ve played with at least one mage in literally every group. The simple fact is that mage/lock aoe dps isn’t nearly as good as the echo chamber thinks it is.
---
Even with intercept you can still kill a warrior that is 6 lvls higher then you. Intercept is a 30 second CD, blink is 15 seconds. If you keep up a frostbolt slow they can never reach a mage, it's a very one sided match up.
---
I think the original range was 50,000 yards, you're just not supposed to be able to cast it again without going back to your original perspective. So if you have a great vantage point you should be able to check out an entire zone.
---
I’m not very far but I was pulling 60 DPS in SFK at 23 which was top in group so idk, maybe it’s viable but then again endgame is diff
---
This group is just a bunch of sad kids that want the attention of streamers because they don't get recognized in twitch chat.  Let's be real, next they will be swating people.
---
Dont apologize, kill him again.

People can say staged but... i feel this..

I still have all my .TGA files that Blizz's screenshots used to automatically save as.

Yeah boars are no joke, you can out run the buff duration though. shoot em and run until they lose the speed boost then fight

Yes yes very good

I know that already
---
how many binds are actually required ??
---
Oh god.  I had such a huge stack of these in vanilla.
---
He's a socialist so he's clear.
---
You can see the server IP with Windows’ Resource Monitor utility. LOL
---
All of them are for a specific location in the inventory, and not the name of the item. The item jumps around in the lineup and therefore isn't in the same spot each time

I'm more alarmed by the one over the chat frame.

My guess that it was a zone that was reserved for a future expansion and was never implemented, similar to the empty area above SW and the other empty area above Stratholme. If you log into retail you can see that i no longer there, we can assume it was claimed by the sea during the Cataclysm. The whole never existed zone is now totally deep sea, you get fatigue after swimming a few meters in the water.
---
The cross realm thing really killed it.
---
Yet services for party members are usually done free of charge, mage food/water for example. And at this point in the game most rogues are getting much needed skill points for opening those chests.
---
Haha I went back and learned it when I was higher level. The 80s didn’t seem so bad then.
---
Honestly, while crushing blows are obviously bad, bears have so much health and armor that a crushing blow or two isn't going to kill you. Especially if your healers are on their A game. Bears are perfectly capable of main tanking the majority of bosses in vanilla, the only ones that are potentially difficult to do are ones that enrage, due to a druid's lack of defensives.
---
Now, granted, I'm not saying they're the *best* at doing so. Personally I'm looking to be more of an OT with the occasional kitty dps myself, but MT bear is fine. It's mainly just a matter of whether people will let you do it, more so than the ability to do it.

Welcome to classic WoW. Same with hunters and ammo, and ‘locks with soul stones 👍🏼
---
oh shit, they already added snapchat filters?
---
I like the macro, but you are going to need to add something after #showtooltip if you want it to display a tooltip.
---
they're pretty bad for vael if you're not clearing the dps check easily. It's 1.12 so it's not too bad anyhow, but he has a habit of just killing druids with a stray crush or crit before their time. So if you need the extra time to dps before you run out of tanks, use a warrior.
---
what spots you recomend to grind at those lvls?
---
That’s not what I said is it? The simple fact is that it’s not that hard to be top dps in any instance group right now, because any actually good dps are in guild premades, everyone doing pugs is basically trash.
---
Ahh, it happens when flying to Sun Rock Retreat sometimes too, so I guess that has something to do with flying from one instance into another.
---
Use rockbiter instead of windfury, it does more damage and it's far more consistent. Combine with strength of earth/grace of air when you're going to be in the area long enough to benefit from them your consistent damage becomes much improved 
---
Open with auto attack&gt;stormstrike/lightning shield if it's not up (most damage per mana of any shaman ability and it benefits from the 20% nature damage from stormstrike)/searing totem if you'll be able to get value from the full duration and then don't cast anything else so your mana naturally regenerates. 
---
You shouldn't have an issue with 2 mobs, just treat stoneclaw as a cc and burst one down while the other is focused on the totem. 3 mobs is also usually fine, stoneclaw and then kite one mob away from the others and you can pick them off. More than that use stoneclaw/earthbind/ghostwolf and run
---
Fighting higher level mobs is always going to suck as a class that's reliant on consistent auto attack damage, so ideally focus on same level or 1-2 below mobs, anything 3+ levels higher is going to cost all your mana in healing.
---
I rolled my paladin alt on a lowpop server. When i was level 23, the highest on the server was a 37 mage. I was the only alliance member north of wetlands lol.
---
The server was so new at that point if you searched "Linen" on the auction house you got less than 20 results.
---
Also works like that in DAoC, GW2, and ESO.

It's a huge corner stone of faction vs faction MMOs now.

Sub to the game, install WoW classic. There is a drop down menu, do not accidentally install "World of Warcraft" it's an entirely different game. I am considering classic the best game I've ever played. Its more fun for me now than it was 15 years ago. The first time through I practically solo leveled the entire game as a rogue. Now I am duo leveling warriors with my buddy, this has been insane fun for me. People say nostalgia, it's wrong. The game is extremely well designed and after playing so many shitty games I am realizing how great of a job the original team did.

Making gold is stupid simple. It's learning to play without all the potential  benefits of spending all your gold immediately, which absolutely fucks most new players.

There’s no easy answer, unfortunately.  If you’re looking for a raiding guild you may have to wait to see who’s clearing content in a month or 2.  The catch 22 is guilds worth being in don’t have to advertise, you’ll come to them.  Maybe check this out:
---
https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds
---
They'd be stupid not to try to capitalize on it and they'll certainly get some sales and even convince some number of people to play retail longterm.

Glad you feel that way. Quit the game and move on if it's not your style. Nobody's forcing you to play it. Or even like it for that matter.

This is actually something that looks interesting to keep track of. It looks like from your edit alone people are still transferring. Then again, does this addon count level 1’s? I really hope this realm grows. Can’t believe Skeram went from full to high but Herod still has massive ques. Wish I had waited a day or so before transferring, wouldn’t of had a reason to leave Skeram!

After having so many herbs ninjad from me while fighting off enemies to clearly be able to pick the herb, this gives me faith that not everyone is a wanker.

I was just excited and took the pic and hearthed back without a good picture, whoops
---
*sigh* Crushing blows and criticals are still in 1.12, that's why druids aren't great at tanking bosses. that's literally the reason why we didn't use them to tank bosses. Certain bosses just massacre them, and bwl specifically is really hard on them. You make a comeback for a few fights in AQ40 and Naxx, but even then there are fights that are good at killing bears specifically. It's frustrating cause we HAD a feral druid, but he pretty much would have to just afk catform on some fights.
---
&gt; As more mobs are killed the amount of money in the world will increase.
---
So will the amount of Staff of Jordans...
---
Well either you tank or you don't I'd say. If you make an effort to actually tank the instance runs you can - but that takes running with a shield, spending your mana wisely, etc. 
---
If you're there as DPS don't use rockbiter and don't use earth shock (except rank 1 to interrupt) - you're making the tank confused, and the healer work harder, if you take aggro. As a DPS your one task is staying below the tank in threat, don't negate that just because your healer is keeping you alive.
---
Where they ever really a challenge?
---
google paladin quests and check who do you need to talk to if you're dwarf
---
Does it say "offline"? Some neckbeards have been ddosing.
---
Well, you did ignore essential shortcomings that prevent the spec from functioning at the same level as a warrior, regardless of its TPS output.
---
Scholo is basically the attention check dungeon. If you pay attention and focus your kill order its pretty easy but there are some mechanics that can rly punish people for not paying attention. I cant remember the names of the mobs but in the first room there are mobs in the pack that will silence everyone in an AOE, others that are immune to physical or immune to magic etc. Depending on your grp comp you need to focus these in an order to avoid them taking all of your mana and smaller CD's to kill one pack.
---
Just to give you a perspective, this type of add and business is directed towards people in parts of the world such as Venezuela where $230 a month is an insane income for them.
---
Well I actually AM on a medium to high pop server, unlike yourself. So we will indeed see what tune I sing when I am absolutely not impacted by any of this.
---
If you're talking about tanking scholo/strat/ubrs/etc sure. Fury is fine for tanking. You'll still probably want to put on a shield until your group is a bit raid-equipped, but talent-wise, it shouldn't be a problem at all.
---
Every time you respec it will cost more and more until it caps out at 50g. It will never reset and stay at 50g.
---

No you don't.  If you just put #showtooltip it uses the icon/tooltip for the first available ability.
---
Please tell me he got the boot.
---
Do we have specific subreddits for each classic server yet?
---
I love how many Elite quests theyre in classic. Redridge ogres and Wetlands dwarves come to mind. Really slow or impossible to solo if ur not a hunter but like a mini dungeon if u group up.
---
I’ve been opening with holyfire if there’s not a lot of other people around, need to dump all that mana from spirit tap somehow. 
---
But if there’s a lot of people around I’ll just use mind blast to get the faster tag. 
---
Once I spec into the holy talent that speeds up holy spells it’ll probably be more optimal.
---
Except the Staff of Jordan supply wont be going up at the same curve as gold. The higher the level the more gold a person makes per hour. The more higher level players the steeper the curve of gold growth in the economy.
---
Well, first, it was a comment about the drop in hunters and how high warriors are compared to others.
---
Second, unless you are main tanking raids (which is a severe minority of warriors), you can tank any and everything as a full dps spec. Using the respec excuse when respecting isn’t necessary just shows either ignorance (or stupidity) or stubbornness.
---
You only need to be honored to get a Douse. To get the infinite Douse you need revered.
---
Yes, socialism is a spectrum.
---
But the Nazis purged all their socialists when they no longer needed them. Look it up, it's called the knight of the long knives.
---
They called themselves socialists and spouted some anti-capitalist tripe to take advantage of the rising popularity of socialism, not because they actually were anti-capitalist or socialist.
---
In Burning Crusade, I grouped with a warrior who had his gun pull macroed to /say the beloved Patty Smyth lyric in the post title.

I'll be honest I ran over 3 people, drove two cars off the road and shot a man in Reno because I have to be at work today instead of on WoW Classic.

---
I sell things at a price point I feel is fair and will sell without wasting my deposit. If that's undercutting 33-50% I don't care. Gold is gold.
---
Up to SFK I pulled aggro on crits with flametongue even, but you can easily tank 1 mob for a pull i'd say, if you're geared enough to pull threat.
---
Stamina doesn't impact your healing... It's more survivability.
---
Depends on the content they roll out.
---
Priests are capable of farming lashers in Dire Mail East. Look it up. You can make around 50g/hour doing this. 
---
It does require holy nova so you’ll need to go with a healing spec that is compatible with both farming and whatever else you want to do. Otherwise, you’d have to respec.
---
Fancy Bear?

There's a sinister group within the shadowy world of organized crime called "Fancy Bear?" For real?

can people loggin who were on the westside of the world?
---
The highest the level of players, the more Staff of Jordans entering the economy. It's a high level drop.
---
It’s dirty money. Only explanation
---
That looks like the in game combat text telling you that you were buffed. Should be able to find settings in interface options.
---
Do both have 1h cooldown ?
---
What do you mean you "switched factions for just a moment"? You're on a PVP server, you can't have the other faction. Did you log onto another account to message them?
---
thats what i thought
---
I love the undead flow but orc feels awful to me. Sooo much running.
---
&gt; wasn't necessarily in reference to video games exclusively
---
Nobody was stating that it was.
---
Top level dad joke!
---
Just don't get them wet
---
I'll find you the video but I can also write it down for you. It wasn't hard. Infact alot of the guides i worked with were completely opposite of what I expected. For example, every guide I worked with said "Oh the first part where protecting the lady from getting ganked by the defias, super easy you can do it as a level 20 paladin" was completely false. Failed this 4 times and the only reason why I passed this was because a lvl 18 gnome mage got lost and helped me by accident. This was genuinely the worst part of the entire ordeal and I have no idea how level 20 paladins can solo this.
---
The Deadmines part was easy because all I had to do was just run deadmines and kill the goblins where the shredder is.
---
The Blackfathom deeps part was easy because you didn't have to go to BFD to finish it, farming the nagas outside the instance was enough. Killed 3 and got the gem and went on with my way.
---
Loch Modan part only required you to take to dwarf and get the box from the ogres (ogres are elite, but you can avoid all of them)
---
The SFK part is where it gets super rng-y. The hammer itself is really easy to get, but the first couple pulls are annoying. I did the SFK part with a crappy 17dps green sword and any pull with more than 2 I had to kill one, run out of the instance and do that over and over. If you get really insanely unlucky with your seal of command procs, you will die.
---
Once you get to the boss downstairs, all you have to do is bubble, open the door and talk to the guy so he can open the courtyard door for you. The boss will kill you but make sure you dont release! Make sure you see the guy open the courtyard door and then you can release and start walking back (long walk back btw).
---
After that you just start pulling stuff in the courtyard 1 by 1 and clear the path to the stables and bam, you got your hammer!
---
Classic is too easy dungeons/raids can be cleared by anyone

Also farming the gorillas in stv. Made bank farming for a few hours. I have skinning though which really increased my gold per hour.
---
You want us to change your mind so you stop having bad opinions?
---
People say paladins never die, but I’m a level 10 and die constantly when questing because I can’t figure out how to pull only one enemy. Is there something I’m missing?
---
Thank you for the input, that’s more or less what I’m trying to say from a less informed point of view. Correct me if I’m wrong but socialism has branched out into many different variations throughout history right? I was just trying to say that by definition Hitler believed in a form of socialism albeit a very loose variation that doesn’t have a lot in common with traditional socialism we are used to today. I probably shouldn’t have responded to someone who thinks it’s wrong to try to understand everyone’s point of view, that was my mistake. Hopefully the severs get sorted out soon.
---
Second only to ggwp when you realize you’ve lost and opt to surrender instead of dragging out out for another few minutes.
---
According to some random Reddit post I saw, it was some sort of protest against mods that were allegedly banning anti-Hitler articles or something along those lines.
---
So basically you’re arguing against a point that doesn’t involve you in any way for no reason at all other than to be arguing?
---
Not to mention that you can change raid frames based on size of the party/raid.
---
Thanks you rock :)
---
Cant be aggressive with all broken gear lmfao
---
I mean...kinda sad?
---
Agreed. Only rolled undead for the shoes.
---
Yep - they’re like Putin’s personal cyberattack squad: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear
---
If you ever think you are a failure take a good look at those loosers coz you are still way better than them.
---
Sounds like you just got unlucky or your server sucks. I had very very few negative experiences like that so far. Then again, I'm on the EU RP server, which I assume selects for more social people to begin with.

**Fancy Bear**
---
Fancy Bear (also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit, Tsar Team and STRONTIUM) is a Russian cyber espionage group. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has said with a medium level of confidence that it is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and security firms SecureWorks, ThreatConnect, and Fireeye's Mandiant, have also said the group is sponsored by the Russian government. In 2018, an indictment by the United States Special Counsel identified Fancy Bear as two GRU units known as Unit 26165 and Unit 74455.The name "Fancy Bear" comes from a coding system security researcher Dmitri Alperovitch uses to identify hackers.Likely operating since the mid-2000s, Fancy Bear's methods are consistent with the capabilities of state actors. The group targets government, military, and security organizations, especially Transcaucasian and NATO-aligned states.

So this is what I ended up with....figured I would share it with anybody interested, in case it helps someone else.
---
    #showtooltip Hunter's Mark
---
    /petfollow [noexists]
---
    /stopmacro [noexists]
---
    /petassist [help]
---
    /assist [help]
---
    /cast [harm] Hunter's Mark
---
    /petattack [harm,nodead]
---
    /petdefensive [harm]
---
Upon pressing this macro:  
---
\-If you aren't targeting anything, the pet will stop attacking and follow you, and nothing else is executed in the macro.
---
\-If you are targeting a friendly target (say your party's tank) and execute this macro, your pet will assist the target and you will also switch to the target's target (assist) and cast Hunter's Mark.
---
\-If you are targeting an unfriendly target, your pet will attack it unless it's already dead and switch to Defensive and you will cast Hunter's Mark.  
---
I also made
---
    /cast [nopet] Call Pet; [@pet,dead] Revive Pet; Mend Pet
---
If you don't have a pet summoned, call it. If you pet is dead, Revive it. Else, Mend it.  
---
    #showtooltip Aspect of the Hawk
---
/castsequence !Aspect of the Hawk, !Aspect of the Cheetah
---
This swaps between Aspect of the Hawk and Aspect of the Cheetah. If you use it, don't forget to include the !Aspect of the Hawk(Rank #) if you have a higher rank available.   
---
I couldn't figure out a more elegant way of doing this, as conditionals prevent casting on Aspects for whatever reason. If anybody knows how to get conditionals working with Aspects, please let me know.
---
Can't they find groups for mythic?
---
play it fun baby
---
classic wow made him forget
---
pretty sure my 200 gold would be worth more lul
---
Are you a warrior? I'm not expert but it just seems super tough at low levels. But you also likely just need to agro less than you are used to. I think you need to not spam taunts and use them more strategically (like focusing on low health dps/healer.)
---
230 a month.. like you make that in 3 days of work
---
Dude... you aren’t gonna get Reddit’s help with those kind of comments.
---
I don't entirely disagree but you can't compare then by the metrics of now. I'm having fun regardless. Also they are going to to dirty things to the comment section here, this place is very love it blindly or gtfo.

---
Two of the best names ever for your characters in the meme. Haha
---
Good bot
---
Well I have an account created in 2005, the ability to create long lost LW patterns on a toon, and a PvP title you could only get in Vanilla.
---
But I didn't stop playing like a lot of the elitist people on here so I dunno if moderately enjoying BfA makes me a retail player even though I cut my teeth on Corrupted Blood.
---
That was my first world drop epic back in Vanilla. Grats.
---
I've seen others state it decays. Is that not accurate?
---
Said the guy who took the free transfer to a dead server, smart move huh?
---
Enjoy the downvote on your thread. I'll have a good laugh thinking about you jerking yourself off all alone in your capital city for the rest of Classic.
---
I HATE WARRIOR DPS. There, I said it. I hate them. They're just awful. It isn't their DPS that's the problem. Their DPS is fine, I suppose, no, it's the damage they take.  I use recount and in dungeons I watch the damage taken meters. I watch it like a hawk. Normally, what makes me happy, is a nice, almost logarithmic, drop off in damage. The overwhelming majority goes to the tank, then the melee DPS/pets, and then the ranged DPS. I can just pop a bubble on a dps, tank regains aggro and I just heal the tank. Maybe a renew if the dps took to big of a hit. Not what happens when there's multiple warriors. Arms warriors are threat machines and I just watch the meters as the tank struggle to gain aggro and you just drink in damage. Unlike all of the other dps players, you never learned proper threat management for your class, so you're constantly ripping aggro off the tank. And I can't bubble you. Getting smacked does wonders for your rage generation.   
---
So you have to be healed. 
---
Which means wasted cast time. 
---
Which mean less focus for the tank.
---
Which mean more time healing. 
---
Which means less time spent with mp5 regen.
---
Which means more drinking.
---
Which means slower dungeon runs.  
---
You also don't know when to stop. You'll be a death's door and go hard core Leeroy Jenkins. No, using whirlwind when you have less than 10% health in a pack of 3 mobs isn't a good idea, I know it seems that way, but it's not. The rogue knows when to stop. The mage knows when to stop, tbh the warlock and druid never really started(jk, jk :p), and hunter is feigning death (WTB Feign death, 5g), but you? YOU!?! That's when you decided *you're really going to get started*. Let's generate ALL THE THREAT. Then you die and make a joke. It was funny the first time. It made me worry about your repair bill the 4 time.  
---
Please, warriors, if you want to DPS, learn to DPS. It isn't just about doing damage. It's about working with your group. It's cool watching multiple charges go off at once. It is It isn't cool drinking every two big pulls.
---
It's actually less in classic than vanilla and early expansions before because of layering. It's still there of course, but layering mitigates the number of people in a zone pretty heavily.
---
Guano Gang baby
---
How many people were in it lol?
---
Holy shit you weren't joking. It's not even masked for something like that. These guys are actually bots.
---
I’m pleasantly surprised when we come across a mob with a green level :)
---
Not at all, but most of my friends have been stuck in queues so I don’t feel like I’m to far behind !
---
Surprisingly, throwing bodies at a problem wont always fix it.
---
Not saying nothing can/should/should have been done to prevent this, but its not nearly as simple as people are making it out to be. A dedicated neckbeard with a large enough Botnet and some know how Will be able to disrupt your service, atleast initially.
---
That’s me fighting a mob a level below me while I’m using a weapon I’ve got my +5 weapon skill racial.
---
She wasn't as mad as this makes out, but we did have to have a talk about it xD
---
Thanks man thats exactly what I was looking for
---
Thought about making a guild with the same name this morning, hah!
---
Literally this joke if flying over my head and I'm so confused.
---
Does not work. Only tracks overpower in battle stance. The addon needs to track when an enemy unit dodges an attack from you. Tried setting that up in weak auras but no succcess.
---
25, and yes she should leave me.
---
Make a quick Weak Aura. Super easy.
---
I can't ... so fucking annoying
---
So getting windfuried makes you dumb?

The majority of people have leveled out of RFK by now (or started new toons and are too low)

Myz represent!
---
Awesome experience!  This is the kind of thing a lot of modern games lack, meaningful open world encounters.
---
This low effort shit.
---
Unfortunately you need to backpedal when you nova/coc because leeway is awful. I haven’t even had backpedal bound in over 12 years so it feels so bad to me, but backpedaling doesn’t activate leeway to its useful now.
---
Yes because Disgaea is hardcore pornography.
---
Kirtonos went down as well x2. Think there's a crash.
---
nvm she bac
---
Yeah that's exactly what I was doing with the same numbers. Like I said, no meters, but I just felt like waiting for the energy for backstab was too slow and clunky. Especially when doing something like SM GY with 2 higher level mages. I'm preferring my hybrid sword/sinister strike sub style.

WoW is being DDos'd now? I just got DC

The way those moons dont line up is hurting me internally

What addon is that bar on the top of the screen?  Also, grats

Not if you moonwalk everywhere you go like a BOSS.

Leatrix Maps (what I use personally) or Mapster

Both are good map addons

Honestly if you are that far away just keep questing, you will have the gold by 42ish

Why is this sub so full of regular TD posters what the fuck

And we're back  down...

&gt; and it made me really happy
---
top 10 anime plot twists of all time
---
Kromcrush is kill
---
Yep same
---
Well now I know why I wasnt getting it. The picture expanded I only seen the first 2 lines.
---
I agree that video games are not the cause, but by the same reason neither are guns. The callous attitude and general lack of care given to youth is the problem. 
---
I grew up around guns. Shot my first gun at around 8 years old, after years of lessons on safety. Nobody in my family, both immediate and extended, has ever had to shoot anyone thankfully, but our existence disproves the theory that "guns = violence." My best friend grew up around guns, and he was even abused as a child. He's the most likely person I know to have been a mass shooter, but even he hasn't even pointed a gun at someone.
---
Video games don't cause violence, pencils don't mispell words, and guns aren't the reason people kill each other.
---
Yes it seems to be down
---
yes. Herod is offline atm
---
I am.
---
Same for me on Benediction.
---
I would waste my entire life on wow if they did this
---
shows offline for me
---
stalagg as well
---
They are merging it
---
wait people are already leveling alts? how no life can you be?? holy shit
---
Same thing, my characters are gone
---
70 isn't high. That's an hour or so of cloth grinding at worst.
---
Where does the hacking part come in? I think you're a bit confused bud.
---
Incendious down
---
I think the toxic gatekeeping and making up shit about retail for upvotes non stop because RETAIL BAD and YOU ARE PLAYING THE GAME WRONG is way worse then expecting someone to just screenshot and paste to reddit.
---
Dc again
---
Herod offline for me
---
Yep, it's ded
---
Stop defining how others enjoy games. Not everyone came here for barrens chat and fishing.
---
I got dced from Benediction and can't log back on
---
You’re expected to have them for serious PvP. They’re mostly a luxury for anything else.
---
Same, I'm on Myz too.
---
I care about 8.2.5 and I care about 8.3 and I care about Classic. What is wrong with people like you?
---
I was in the middle of combat too :(
---
will u kill greys too :D?
---
Nice cropp
---
That's how you play classic that's not how everyone plays classic and it's not how everyone played vanilla.  You're just a casual and that's fine but don't think everyone else is.
---
Everything seems to be down
---
Yes, offline :(
---
Yeah been off and on this morning
---
One year in jail, literal quote from the article, but better than nothing.
---
engineering give you the ability to craft grenades and bomb who do ranged damage and also have some stuns/slow/root
---
Same on Kromcrush
---
i can't even get into stalagg. so maybe there is an issue
---
Download Weakauras.
---
Go on Wago.io and search for classic auras that track what you want them to.
---
same on Deviate Delight
---
I tried to be nice today to this lvl 32 warlock. As soon as i passed him he attacked me. Im 30lvl priest and killed him, but im gonna stop being nice.
---
&gt;Unlike retail wow where you can go from lvl1 to 120 in a week
---
You can do that in Classic. Retail takes just as long unless you're speedrunning it with heirlooms (an optional). The amount of in-game hours required to hit cap without looms is nearly the same.
---
&gt; it was about doing quest and meeting new people.
---
You can do that in both. I just played retail yesterday and was chatting it up with a bunch of random people while leveling in timewalking dungeons. The dungeons aren't tuned well due to age, and we all kept laughing at our wipes and chit chatting between boss pulls.
---
WoW, retail or Classic, is what you make of it. I've made zero effort to make friends in Classic and I have zero friends in it. I'm questing alone and most people who inv me to a group for group quests never say a word. I end up talking to myself half the time in party chat.
---
yea just got dc'd and says i have no chars on the server when i try to log in
---
DUDE I WAS HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME. WHY THE FUCK DO PEOPLE DO THIS SHIT.
---
I am very annoyed.
---
Wait what? Who DDOS'd Blizzard?
---
You made the choice to go there? Was this not one of cons you guys talked about before moving?
---
Herod is visible in the server list for me, but it says that I don't have any characters...
---
Get your blacklist going.
---
Every time i retrieve realm list i choose Herod, which shows i have 0 characters i get instantly disconnected.
---
skeram as well
---
I tried to log into Herod and it doesn’t show me having characters on the server anymore.
---
My character is gone
---
As a rogue I can tell you for sure I've killed plenty of people 5 levels above me.
---
same thing on stalagg. when i get into the server selection it doesnt say i have any toons
---
Same for Atiesh

Whitemane also down right now.

Got kicked from Kirtonos and logged in, only to find that all my characters have been deleted. lmao  nice

went offline

more experienced? lol they cant even stop it or seem to fix it anytime soon.. yea, so experienced.

roll for it. it's a team effort.

It goes to the rogue unless the rogue puts it up for roll.

Coz it costs money

What? No? Both are creepy as fuck. If she's drawn like she's 8 and acts 45 it's creepy. If she's drawn like shes 45 and acts like she's 8 it's creepy.
---
Seriously google the word "Loli". You have some really warped perceptions of what it is, and may be making yourself look like a creep to people.
---
Either that or you're just a creep and trying to hide behind a smokescreen.
---
Herod was just down too
---
How does this happen? Is this intentional?
---
It took you longer to post this than it took to wait in the login server queue.
---
They did it this way back in the early days of wow. It's because that realm matches your realm type but has a much lower population. They are giving you the option to escape the queue but do not want you to choose just anywhere so that populations become overall more balanced.
---
BIGGLESWORTH CREW

---
Logging in is a disaster. Can't get into Benediction
---
Dead maul? New player
---
Free roll to everyone, rogue unlocks for them
---
Kromcrush is down right now.
---
the former would stop if the latter stopped first
---
a lot of the early quests give 420 exp and stuff. BTW i got in but once i clicked on my server, it just booted me to the login screen and back into queue
---
Yes, as I recall learning in vanilla, every single mob you forget to loot and leave lying there to rot had a random world drop BoE epic on it. Every. Single. One.
---
Hope they enjoy their prison time and start crying like bitches when they get caught.
---
Locked chest to the rogue, he/she can feel free to allow for rolls or leave stuff in they don't want. But if the rogue isn't there, no one gets it, so they get first crack.
---
Unlocked chest is rolled for.
---
Yep...
---
Buddy, I know you can only see things in black and white, and always take a side no matter what. But both of them were wrong at the start of the thread. I was not replying to the top comment.
---
Bigglesworth is down too now
---
Video game companies do not invest in the caliber of resources or engineers compared to real tech companies.
---
Guy seems like a serious skid anyway if it is him. If it's got anything to do with this dude he just paid someone with a botnet
---
You have been disconnected. (WOW52900210)
---
Grind beasts north and west of Brewnall Village. Also, you go to human starting zone, Elwynn Forest, by 
---
1) Go into Ironforge
---
2) Take portal in Tinker Town
---
3) Take train to Stormwind
---
4) Leave out of Stormwind gates to Elwynn Forest
---
5) Walk to Goldshire
---
I feel like Tauren and Dwarves have an unspoken comradely attitude towards each other.
---
It's probably pretty shitty if a couple of hours you were looking forward to.

Only 360s? Rookie moves bro I'm out here smashing tony hawks 920 record.
---
server side
---
i can't get in either...
---
You couldn't honestly expect launch to go off without any problems when there were millions of people trying to login and play at the exact same moment.
---
I'm having problems connecting as well.
---
I mean, I still pay to play, so I can't say much shit, but does it even make sense to have a queue time, having to wait like 100+ minutes just to get into a game, and game gettind ddos attacked, and we pay monthly? 
---
Even free games have servers that are more stable than this.
---
Troubles here too
---
Pretty sure yellow versus green doesn't have anything to do with it. I've been questing with a buddy a few levels below me so the green quests for me have been yellow to him and we've been getting the same rep. None of the guides mentioned yellow versus green either.
---
seems like servers are going down
---
Servers are down, Can confirm!
---
Yes, servers are down.
---
Everything down from what I can tell
---
its getting ddosed apparently
---
It is pretty much common consensus that 2hander arms leveling has the slighter edge for leveling.
---
Hamstring kiting is another advantage since you minimize exposure to enemy swings while keeping your damage output the same as if you were dual wielding. Though with the leeway in classic this might not be as consistent but you can still save yourself from a couple of opponent swings. Don't forget the PvP utility of being arms as well if on a PvP server.
---
&gt; Your auto attacks would be critting like crazy, you’d have a ton of rage then you can just heroic strike/cleave down mobs. 
---
Your auto attacks only start critting like crazy at like lv 53+. Your auto attacks would also be missing like crazy. Warrior leveling is considered difficult because the other classes have a much easier time and compared to rogues, you have to ramp up rage starting slow at first, it's not because warriors are inherently hard to play.
---
Yep, servers are down.
---
When you get in you won't be able to join a server (And all the populations are 'Low' (empty))
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
same thing happened here. just dc's me every time i try to log back in
---
it also allows you to cast mind flay without it being intterupted
---
What do you think is getting more visibility:
---
A comment on each separate thread, already created or a post that might get some traction?
---
“Haha jokes on you, UKDrillas isn’t even my real name” -them probably
---
Usually freeroll. The chest gives him lockpick skill points. So he wins either way.
---
And at the end it doesnt even matter who wins. When the green is useful for someone they usually get it. Aslong as the group is social
---
Wtf.
---
Yup thought it was my internet doing its daily go offline but I guess it is everyone

If you cant buy the gold in game shop you will buy it from 3rd party websites. There is a reason for this chinafarmers

if you ask me - if he's the only one that can unlock it, it's his.  You could also just sneak back later and open it after the dungeon is done if it becomes a huge issue lol
---
this is hilarious and exactly how I imagine OP at acti-blizz headquarters
---
Having the same problem all morning.
---
I unlock it but allow others to roll on the loot
---
Seems to be.
---
I live in Kurinaxx
---
yes someone is doing it on purpose hes bragging about it on twitter
---
Thanks for the clarification:)
---
Yeah they were calling bomb threats into schools and stuff like that too, so they attracted a lot of big time attention like morons. They apparently assume that just because they don't focus on it very publicly that organizations like the FBI don't have good cybercrime brances I imagine. Feds just usually have more important things to deal with than a bunch of nerds on the internet doing dumb shit until they escalate.
---
can it not be down plz
---
You're at the mercy of the Rogue.
---
rogue or blacksmith who unlocks it

So?
---
Doesn't take much looking around to see it's been happening for a few hours now.
---
I'll try it next time, hopefully the party won't mind it. I grabbed the staff from the quest since it's way better than anything I have.
---
Yeah primarily for leveling as I plan to be Holy at 60.
---
They're still fucking salty that we bitched so much for Classic. So they're putting the minimal amount of effort into server upkeep.
---
Wonder what the deal is
---
Yeah a lot of them seem to be going up and down. Just got a queue for login (before server selection) as well.
---
you say that but its already been 3+ hrs with no sign of stopping soon

Each mob type or each specific mob? And is there a database somewhere? Thank you btw

Meanwhile Hordies are roasting haunch of gnome over a fire pit.

Honestly a really nice chromebook will probably run classic well.

Make sure it as 16gb ram and intel 4k HD graphics and you should be good to go for under $300.

I've never not aggressively topped dps while leveling my druid.
---
Referring to the criminals as "random idiots" works just as well as identifying them though- identifying them just satisfies their craving for attention.
---
I like your skins. What addon do you use to change the skin of the bag like that? Also dig your font. Ok I’m gonna need a list here lol.
---
Has DDOS been confirmed?
---
Just use the Print Screen button / snipping tool next time.
---
It's a DDoS, been happening to both US and EU all morning.
---
Greetings!
---
I'm not looking for a gotcha as people like you are a lost cause I just don't understand the contradictions. People who see it as a bodytype are wrong yet it's still loli hm.
---
I am older, 37, but I had heard of his record breaking viewership at launch so I decided to tune into his stream one day for a few hours.  All it was was him bitching at people in the chat for doing dumb shit.  Just constant arguing.  I do not ever see myself watching that again.
---
Well, they probably want a ransom of some sort. I think Blizzard can handle this, I'm sure they have dealt with "DDoS" attacks before.
---
Source for DDOS?

Bingo - this is the answer.

they just want attention
---
Same issue
---
i ran SM from 37 to 39 and never seen it drop. 2 days later i went and saw 2 drop in 6 runs.  Drop doesn't seem to high
---
Thanks! I was mostly hoping someone had a list of all quests that reduce rep with either of the factions, that way I could knock those all out and know that I don't need to worry about messing it up going forward. I also seem to recall that getting from Revered to Exalted with Bloodsail used to be a bit of a feat, because where were only a few mobs that would get you through that part of  the grind. I'm fairly sure I can get up to at least Revered with Steamwheedle on nothing but the mobs south of Ratchet.
---
you rock! thanks!
---
They might be trying to capitalize on the market of people who are just 1 or 2 short of whatever they need
---
It kindof kills the joke if you have to say it out-loud.
---
I'm confused, why are so many people talking about jail time? What happened?
---
"every time"
---
literally only happening today and only 20 minutes ago
---
get some perspective.
---
My server's barrens chat is Trump shills getting pasta everywhere...
---
www.wowhead.com
---
Asshats.
---
Exactly what i was thinking, lack of druids in the world firsts for a reason.
---
and you're giving them it
---
Honestly? Probably. I would expect them to load their site with hijack malware to use your system in future/current attacks.
---
DDOS attack
---
I was asking what fights druid can't. Message I was replying changed and quote didn't help.
---
Yesh, I think some servers are down.  I just tried, too.
---
Most servers are being DDOS'd
---
Shut up fool
---
Yep got booted off about 20-ish minutes ago. Can't reconnect.
---
someone should try and get there info and forward it to activation so they can sue them for damages! that 4c place usually can get that info really quick!
---
Please don't call this hacking. Doesn't take any thought or skill.
---
Hackers.
---
Except it's been radio silence on live right now too
---
I know right? the guy has gained over 300 followers already for this...
---
What exactly about my comment shows entitlement on my part? Faerlina has been down almost 3 hours. One of the highest population servers. No official response is a bit surprising to me when the games I play would have an announcement out within minutes if a server was down.
---
I am asking if this is typical as I don't play Blizzard games. Explain to me how asking that question shows entitlement?
---
Just giving information.

Why do pathetic "hackers" like this exist?

Why can't they do something constructive?

Asshattery better?

Has it been confirmed as DDOS?

The developers of Runescape. Their customer support is barebones at best, and they’ve dropped the ball on community communication quite a few times.

why is the horse named invincible if you can see it?

why is his name deathwing if he can still hear?

What are they even trying to accomplish? Do they just want to be assholes ruining some innocent fun?

It was exactly 5g a month as I remember it. But chances are if you are racking up respec for some reason there is no real benefit except saving 5g once a month lol.

Yesterday early morning Thunderfury was Low. I got so many quests done.
---
Both are normal. Some people make the effort and some aren't so savvy. I'm saying it's normal for some to not get their mount at 40 and instead a bit later.
---
It's across all servers. People are raging over on the WoW tech support forums.
---
They get caught.
---
Yup, Redditors are gigantic losers. No one outside of Reddit likes them...for good reason too.

DDOS Attack from UKDrillaz
---
This is so accurate
---
Well if he didn't post it I'd have no idea what was wrong and would be wondering what was wrong with my computer, so thanks OP
---
When i run dungs, i just let the rogue have it.
---
Well, let's say each mob group. You can check wowhead for details about which mobs can drop what.
---
There’s so much to do outside of raids.
---
Same on Kormcrush
---
It's not really something you can estimate. DDoS attacks are really hard to circumvent because they are basically just using the server's intended purpose but just to an extreme. For Instance, when the classic servers first came up and they were super laggy and hard to play? That's literally a DDoS, just an unintentional one.
---
I'm not exactly sure how they stop a real attack, I guess they would  have to figure out what is real and what is a DDoS and block connections based on that.
---
Wikipedia is small potatoes.  Non-profit and isn't a threat to anyone.  Attacking Wikipedia is like tearing out the pages of a Dictionary....just why?  
---
Twitch on the other hand is owned by Amazon.  I'm sure their lawyers are basically drug addicts, except their drug of choice is going after people with paperwork and jail time.  This guy basically just set up lines of cocaine in front of a drug addict.
---
People post stacks of 1 to avoid the auction tax or to intentionally flood the market(with the idea being if you see 20 stacks of 1 for a silver each, or 1 stack of 20 for 25 silver you're more likely to buy the  1 stack of 20 to save hassle.)
---
Lmao I guess you aren't aware of how DDOSing works. It's almost impossible to fully protect against.
---
Was in the middle of a great bfd run
---
Ah yes, homophobia. It really is Classic.
---
You act like them getting attention is the end all for everything. Who cares, they're fucking the servers, people are gonna know. Informing people who don't know is more important than caring about them getting attention
---
Same. Bollocks.
---
False - Maybe I'll share a screenshot of my letter, which contained 5g for killing some alliance for someone who was getting ganked. Both sides have both kinds of people.
---
Legion was smooth, BFA was smooth. "But that's a different team..."  my point is that Blizzard has the capability to pull it off.
---
lmao those brainlets didn't target the login server
---
LuL
---
its existed for a long time, there is a website with rules and leaderboard and all.
---
Any news source on that?
---
I’ve heard a lot of people say it in GTA Online also, regarding modders.
---
The fact that there isn't WSG is exactly what had me stop at around 23. I came in 2006 and BGs are all I did. My favorite thing! I'll probably pick up classic again next year once that's in the system but for me all motivation to play has pretty much evaporated
---
Yes I did stare at my screen wondering why I’m playing this game for a bit. The heartbreak is real, but life goes on!
---
Do the Shimmering Flats (bottom of 1k needles) and run RFK; grab the quests. Then do Gnomer once; grab the quest from the engineering trainer in Orgrimmar and use the teleporter in Booty Bay. You need to grab the teleporter quest from the engineering trainer as well.

I need to know which UI you use?

The cash shop will appear when they remove layering.
---
I for one welcome the DDOS attacks. I’m going to the gym, and now have plans to cook food for the week. It’s nice rejoining regular society again.
---
For PVP the slower the better- PVP is all about burst damage.
---
Bloodsailing no more.  :(
---
What's weird is only some members of my guild (Wolf Pack) are getting knocked off. It seems especially bad in the lowbie areas.
---
Is blood legion on Herod?  Also weren't they horde on illidan in vanilla?
---
I was quite confused walking into the AH in SW. I was certain that IF was the only Alliance AH in vanilla. Thanks for unintentionally clarifying that for me :)
---
They are ganking the entire population at once.
---
I hope they get caught and go to jail over something stupid like using kiddie scripts to mess with video game servers.
---
That would be absolutely mint.
---
He has a stupid name, pass it on.

Hehe. This reminds me of the Matrix. Where they say that the first Matrix was perfect and a paradise or something and that made it a complete disaster and a failure.

Just posted my explanation, sorry I’m a slow typer.

When was it hotfixed in real vanilla? I played a hunter in the 1.11-1.12 era and this is how I remember it working.
---
Or it's reasonable to be reasonable as the service you pay for is being inundated by ddos attacks.
---
Why not? You’re not another melt insinuating that pve is a small part of wow right? Haha
---
can you say SKRIPTKIDDIE?!
---
Possible, but not likely.
---
Thank Christ it’s at the start of the semester , not during exam week
---
Just came here yesterday to see if it was still around. Still so creepy.
---
This doesn't really work considering you can only have 2 professions at once and continuously dropping them and leveling them is retarded.
---
Wow, you're such a L337 gamerz.

I mean I get your frustration, but saying it's kids is pretty insulting to young people for no reason.  It could easily be a 50+ year old.  
---
Just call them what they are, a fucking bunch of immature assholes.  As I doubt it's one guy.
---
Thunderfury down :(
---
Because the article is from 2018 and about them successfully extraditing and convicting for a 2010 attack
---
It's true, it also takes daddy's credit card.
---
So are there any unique profession buffs in classic? I remember retail had specific ones where you had to be a master in the profession to get them. I remember Enchanters got extra buffs on some equipment, alchemists got super flasks etc. I am Herbalism/Alchemist right now and want to know if you get any reward for leveling
---
Lol dude, people in general don't know what they're talking about most of the time. It's not special to reddit.
---
This, clients wouldn't be sending large amounts of data to the servers. It should be pretty easy to narrow down what IP's are doing this, granted it could be hundreds or thousands of IP's so good luck blocking all of them....
---
Wait until the servers are established before selling it, definitely. It may even pay for your epic mount
---
Don't give this guy any more attention, its what he wants.
---
There's a special place in hell for these monsters.
---
Script kiddie is a technical term, it's covered in study material for security certifications, it's still actively used and has a specific definition which fits here. Why would they not say it?
---
Suggestion: Disenchant this item
---
I did.
---
Play priest. Preist is absolutely bad ass.
---
Are mages charging people for water in their own dungeon groups now, too?
---
Are we withholding buffs, as well?
---
Honestly with the meta being what it is (All warriors + Shaman / All mage dps) a rogue should realize he/she really only exists to unlock boxes anyways. Take that away and why bring one? /s (but also kinda not /s)
---
Guy claiming credit seems to be UK
---
This is the ultimate Rogue gank
---
I mean I was browsing the reddit and its saturated with people asking whats happening. I thought that letting others know before they spam the sub with questions and posts would be helpful.
---
lol wut? It's just a bunch of UK script kiddies.
---
I'm sure this won't be laughing when he is sharing a cell with the Lizard Squad children that got arrested. Don't drop the soap douche.

Obviously I'm playing Classic...  But I have no history with the company thus my fucking question. 
---
Seriously? How fucking hard of a concept is this? Holy shit the hostile, aggro responses here are fucking insane. What a community.
---
I have done Deadmines as a warrior tank and I love it.
---
What is the equivalent to the deadmines for a Horde player?
---
Alliance story.  Mining tin in duskwood,  some druid comes running up asking to leave 1 ore.  When i dont he starts whispering / bashing me for not being helpful to the community and i should leave 1 ore on nodes to help the next guy.  I tell him no,  so he posts it in general chat.  He proceeds to get bashed by everyone in the zone laughing at his suggestion.
---
Nerd on Nerd violence is never cool
---
Whitemane was bad but it died down since no streamers/ tryhard Private server guild fan clubs to keep people from rerolling.

I just can't get past how slow stealth is in vanilla lol
---
If you knew ANYTHING about the game, which you do not, you would know those things are not advantages to end game content, which is the entire point of the game. You cant pay to get a [raider.io](https://raider.io) score, you cant pay to get gear at end game to get in to raids and dungeons, you cant pay to win arenas and get a PvP rating... YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GAME. I do not use the "cash shop" and as such am not a cash shop junkie. 
---
You prove how much you dont know when you list pets in there, literally nobody uses pets and they are not used for anything in the game that means anything at all.
---
There's something going on with you that makes you so insecure about it. Feel left out? Feels like too much to try to learn about? I mean youre proving that you havent even read about retail. Pathetic. You seem like a lonely mid 30s guy who feels afraid to try anything new and if people are doing something that doesnt feel familiar from when he was 20 he needs to lash out and reach and claw for a way to try and feel superior. It was the whole point of your post. You're a loser.
---
paladins are the bet pvp healer and are amazing in PvE. i just leveled my pally as ret and had cloth/healing gear for when i wanted to group as a healer. wasn't too painful to level as ret. likewise with the priest im leveling, i'm going shadow. i say go with what you enjoy.
---
Of all the shit they could pull why do it to fellow nerds? I don’t get it at all! Isn’t there a government they could be bothering? Smh
---
The fact the name is UKDrillas makes me laugh. Drillers in the uk are known as gangbangers and people who make drill music. I guarentee you this guy is some neck beard neek who listens to drill and named himself that. What an absolute autist
---
It’s not the CCP. it’s some kid on twitter who just wants attention.
---
If he rarely has to tank, then he's not an offtank. You're just wasting a DPS Warrior.
---
A Warrior who only casts Hamstring (for the sake of maintaining the buff) will actually do less damage than a Paladin casting seals. And the Paladin can still Cleanse while auto-attacking. Paladin also brings another set of blessings to the raid. It's always better in the hands of a Paladin. Let your Warriors tank and deal damage - it's what they're good at.
---
What's the context to this map? I just see attack type and dest country listed, nothing more granular such as "blizzard servers".
---
Tanks tank, healers heal, all for the party. Rogue doesn't have shit. They got no buffs, bring no utility to the party, and is absolutely useless. If rogues start taking lock boxes for themselves, I'm not inviting them. Their dps sucks anyway.
---
what am i really looking at here?
---
it's not 20 years in the uk, I think it's up to 8 max but still.
---
Nah... there's big money in this... buy some shorts on $ATVI stock worth $$$$$$$$ then crash their servers. Sell the shorts after their stock dips. This is a serious white collar crime. Maybe they're just doing it for the "lulz" but I'm just giving one scenario of how to profit.
---
Let them die. They might learn that way.
---
People still rustling their jimmies over some emoticons
---
"I knew you could do it! Good job, team!"

i will never trust reddit with doxing. They always get that shit wrong. Boston Bombing is one example. Wait until the real facts come out.
---
I can imagine the people ddos ing with their dicks large snickering in a nasally voice
---
I am not surprised lol
---
Yes. Hours of work.
---
I cant connect back and im in echo isles so i feel that
---
There's a theory I read at some point, where people like to ruin things for others because their life is shit.  So, by making others have a shittier time, it somehow levels out their situation subconsciously?  Like, 'hahaha my life sucks, but at least I'm not those guys who I'm shitting on.'
---
Makes no sense to me, just drink yourself into a stupor when you're miserable like the rest of society.
---
Oh yeah, that. It still works, but is completely random based off the server lag so pretty much useless.

There's a twitter that's been bragging about DDOSing Blizz servers, specifically servers with streamers and all PVP realms. They claim to be hitting other sites as well. If they're going as big and wide as they claim here's to them getting caught and assblasted by any pertinent governing/regulatory agency.

Stop playing on the highest pop servers like szazzarah.

Lok’tar you psychopathic crackhead!

Yeah, I've only played an hour or so here and there since launch of classic. Today I planned to play for a full day and now I'm in the same boat as you all.
---
:crab:
---
Perfect timing, because we have an excellent slate of football today.
---
Retail is down too lmao
---
If you're not first, you're last.
---
Do you understand how DDOS attacks work?
---
Are you serious?
---
I'm a Cybersecurity Engineer. As long as these guys have address-space, there's not much Blizzard can do about this. DDoS mitigation is an after-the-fact response. You can't prepare for attacks from unknown addresses. 
---
The attack will continue to be effective until these guys run out of money for address space.
---
Yea was looking forward to getting some good grinding in today. Wife is out her mom with the baby shopping and hanging out. But I guess not.
---
Little less repented anger next time
---
OP I think these streamers are living in your head rent free
---
Retail was down before, too.  I assume it still is.
---
You can't generally mount in instances. For the majority of classes, mobility during WC is the same as mobility in BRD or Maruadan.
---
BC: don't add dailies, don't add flying, try to keep the world world lively.
---
Wrath: Don't add dungeon finder, discourage use of gearscore, and don't over-do achievements
---
Cata: just don't. don't do it. don't even go there. nothing about cata could be changed to save it.
---
Imagine pretending you're capable of knowing if someone is a stream sniper or just a member of the enemy faction playing on a PvP server.
---
It's not against the rules at all...
---
How do you even do this?
---
Same, I'm sick as fuck and the kids are out of the house for the first time in a while.  Wanted to sit in bed with my laptop and do some quests.  Shit sucks.

No need to stealth if you go combat rogue.  Run up to them and smackem in the face.

I highly doubt this is a real twitter account for anyone since it was created this month. It's a throwaway account.

To be fair Distracting Shot is a hunter spell.

yea lol i was running SFK at the time and it wiped our group right before the last boss and i was just like ah... the good ol days
---
Swing timer on a rogue is pretty useless imo. Min/maxing hits is incredibly negligible compared to swing timing on hunters and 2h warriors.
---
 maybe the player growth created by promo at the levels it exists when ninja plays the game actually exceeds all possible projections for growth, similar to what happened to them when the original launch starting to go viral among pc gamers.
---
I'm not super well versed on network security. Just the very basics learned from googling stuff to fix/improve my own home network. I assumed things like Masking were viable on the enterprise level, although I guess it makes a lot more sense that it's not.
---
Yeah me and a full group of warrior were doing arm and DC'd before boss doors on Fairbanks.
---
Yeah, I'm not really sure what the deal is honestly. Generally the Classic community has been pretty wholesome, but I think the mob defense of Blizzard on this server is a little baffling, considering how much people hate Blizzard on r/wow lol.
---
I think Blizzard as a company has its positives and negatives, just like pretty much every other company. They clearly have some dedicated and passionate people on their team, but they also do suck at communicating with their fanbase.
---
People like you are the problem.
---
As a Tauren Shaman, when should I move over to Eastern side to run RFK? I'm level 22 now, have gotten all the quests I want done from WC and am deciding now whether to move up towards Ashenvale or over to UC areas

You have no idea what youre talking about. They never got found because of the hacking it was other stupid shit. If they never did the other stuff they would have never been located.

You've never seen Shrek 1?

 Not sure, need more information

Hope i was able to answer your 8 questions
---
omfg hes so UGLY atleast asmongold is handsome in a wierd way. SODDAPOPPIN IS UGLY
---
I was at the last boss in BFD. Just want my damn Gravestone Sceptre.
---
Yes, I understood that.  Hence why I said you should just call them immature.
---
And equating immaturity to age is just insulting to all the kids who are quite mature and wouldn't spend their time griefing like that, for no reason.
---
But whatever, I'm just going to get downvoted by the immature peeps who want to talk without being policed.  Rather than just reading my response for what  it is/moving on.
---
Op be dumb af
---
It's probably the best utility rogues have, and makes stealth even usable through the leveling process.
---
Buy the shorts on Friday, DDOS over the weekend, sell at open on Monday.
---
Hope they get publically stoned as a message to the next idiots
---
Right?  Who cares about a mount when I can one shot people off their mounts.
---
Rogue gets all items inside and roll for the green/blue
---
i really hope you're a healer
---
is this a copypasta
---
Did you open to check 10 hours ago then come back 15 minutes ago to post about it?
---
Killing a war at that level its like stealing candies from babies
---
You were probably drunk from alcohol in game.
---
Put together deadmines group last night. Invited a second rogue out of kindness as they were spamming chat for some time lfg. Need heals so give tank party leadership to hearth to SW. Bit into the dungeon I get kicked because I won't agree not to need on a dagger. "Its just a game " they said...but worth being a dick over apparently.
---
I hope it's worth a level 20 dagger.
---
This shows me what I have to look forward to.
---
Dodged a bullet wont be wasting time and money to deal with a shit playerbase.  I got on two different servers afterwards, and asked map chat how everyone was doing, only to get responses like "your mom" and "Gay gay gay muscledick"
---
Maybe I'm just used to a better community coming from GW2 after quitting the first time wow was shit on(after wotlk)
---
 rant over kbye
---
last night horde was over 2k
---
Its this group  (@UKDrillas): https://twitter.com/UKDrillas?s=09
---
All realms are down, moron, including BFA.  And stop calling it "retail".  Classic is retail, just like BFA.
---
....WHAT....Year is it...
---
I'm not sure if they can party either. It seems weird to parry a sword using  your arms.
---
Fortunately they just added Lord of the Rings 2 and 3 to Netflix.  I assume this will have blown over by the time Aragorn is crowned.
---
Wonderful!
---
Stop trolling.
---
everyone report their twitter for spam
---
You could not live with your own ganking, and where did that lead you? Back to me.
---
Coming from a network engineer by day, the pathetic part is Blizzard should have been prepared for a DDOS. We deal with these in the oil/gas industry. It should have been common sense to have their systems on high alert for at LEAST the first year of classic.
---
In my experience, and guilds you can join pre-60 will only be there for social chat. Guilds who raid are much more likely to recruit at 60, so you may need to git gud first! But ymmv
---
Also I can show y'all a great little USB capacitor charging circuit you can use to blast all of the worthless IoT trash your bougie relatives bought over the past 10 years to oblivion where they can't be botnets plaguing our lives.
---
Make pallys playable on horde and a viable tank at end game.

---
You'd think after 15 years of running the biggest MMOs in the world and being one of the largest video game companies, they would have figured out an effective way to filter out the malicious traffic
---
Does anyone has issues with logging into the game? I keep getting kicked out, but the server status appears to be normal.

---
The IP addresses aren't even Blizzard's, they belong to the ISP.
---
There's just only enough players to fill one layer what with the ddos
---
So why did you try trading it? If you won an item that you actually needed, you are fine by me. Your original post isn’t clear.
---
This didn't happen to me, but a shaman healer rolled need on some agi pants from rfk over a rogue. God damn, the amount of vitriol he got from the rest of the party was just uncalled for. I ended up leaving the group, like wtf man, it's low level shit there's no need to get so nasty. They weren't even blue. They even took it to general chat after.
---
Well Fortinet has that more granular information, but they aren't going to make it publicly viewable for obvious reasons. This is just meant to be kind of a cool way to watch global attacks. Blizzard HQ is in California, and I'm sure a good amount of their servers are as well, which is where a lot of these attacks are focused.
---
I stack spirit and the staff was an upgrade of my current weapon so I don't think I was ninja looting.
---
You can get everything you need for a LOIC attack and get everything setup in less than an hour

I mean I'm sure Hillary Clinton would give you some uranium for the right price, but it's gonna take longer than an hour

Blizzard is paying them to do it so we all play Retail! /s

"I hate this person so much, I want them to get more attention"
---
Are you high?? No
---
Play WoW on a Saturday?
---
When its something planned and done by blizzard it works... when it's a third party crashing servers not the best source
---
So glad I work today. BUT NOT TILL 4 AHHHHHHHH

REEEeeeEEEE!!!

Asmongold today: "TODAY IS THE DAY--HITTING 60--PRERAID BIS--UBRS"

funny thing he's at 100k viewers watching him stare at the you've been disconnected screen, which is more than he usually gets actually playing

With those 3 you have everything you need to get a UI that makes everything more easy to understand and order.

Nooooo
---
&gt;That loss of revenue translates to a direct loss in taxes to the federal US govt.
---
Eh, this part is a bit less true. Corporations like blizzard likely pay less in taxes than your average citizen due to the ubiquity of tax havens. US Corporations pay barely anything in taxes once they get big enough.
---
You're right. That was a wild assumption.
---
Distracting shot is a totally different ability used by hunters.
---
If rogues have to roll on the chest after leveling their lockpicking, then miners have to roll on the ore after they mine it....
---
Spi is spirit. Played since vanilla retail and through pservs until classic launched. Literally the first time I’ve seen SpP.
---
Whole of Blizzard login servers went down twice while I was healing WC so its not just the classic servers.
---
That was hellish to heal with 1500 ping.  We eventually disconnected completely and wiped right before rhe final boss
---
Warrior here, can confirm, pain is real.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
Yes, it is a fantastic wand. The +frost damage is excellent, the int and wand damage is just a nice perk.
---
If you have a good group SM Cath AoE farming is likely the fastest unless you are a mage.
---
Even if you are a mage if there is heavy competition on AoE spots then Cath might be better.
---
I remember seeing that stuff when I’d wall jump back in the day. Get to some strange places haha
---
I guess it's a good reason to get ready for my upcoming business trip. 
---
Laundry instead of WoW is not a good tradeoff. Damn script kiddies.
---
I was mid flight, it canceled and dropped me in the water closer to where I wanted to be anyway. That's great, except you know, not being able to log back on.
---
Don't act like this person has any motives.

Are you mentally I'll?
---
vanilla nostalgia
---
I literally answered this several times. What do you people want from me?
---
Well these people are cyber terrorists and should be treated as such. I hope blizzard gets there justice.
---
At least we can all come together this fine afternoon over our hatred for whoever did this.
---
that warrior brings a tear to my eye, no honor and doesn't even know his own limits. Trying to pvp pre-intercept is just a lost cause.
---
Literally got off an hour and a half early, used Teamviewer to check queue. Got home 5 minutes ago.
---
Blizzard didn't do this. Relax
---
Hahaha, I am actually so glad I was born just a tad bit after my family upgraded from Dial up.
---
I think it'd be kind of stupid for them to not go into the expansions.
---
Gonna run out of content at some point and tbc needs to come around  to freshen things up.
---
All these purist "keep it vanilla forever" people won't be playing in a year tops.
---
Everyone else will be super excited for tbc.
---
I'm here with you man, so ready to chill inside after working all week in the sun. Me'n the wife were gonna go fuck around in the barrens all day. Oh well. It will be back soon. Maybe I'll catch up on Mind Hunter.
---
perfection
---
Best guess is a hidden secondary roll
---
Thats AWESOME
---
Hey so maybe we will get some hard numbers on classic population out of this.
---
or is this just fantasy?
---
educating is a perpetual life action, not intermittent.
---
Barrens chat exists here, too.
---
That's fair. I suppose it depends on how you approach the frustration of PvP ruining your quest / day. Personally, it's when I just go fishing lol.
---
Yeet
---
uhhhhh what?
---
Thanks Tomtim, I can't remember if it was one of those dungeons that had a fp/hub near by? Uldaman for example is a pita b/c there isn't one close. Kargath is a bit of a hike.

It looks like a DDOS

Stop giving them attention. Do you people know what trolls are?
---
I'm kinda salty about it being down but also the peoplebehind the ddos are Fucked for life given how blizzard acts legally towards people who do this shit
---
Nope, i'm still here.
---
Tfw you make streamers more money to fuck with streamers.
---
Fellow teacher I hear ya on this.  I guess I can get my grading and lesson planning done now so I can play tomorrow when servers are back up.
---
Yes that's the thing. 4 other members have at least 1 thing that they bring to the team, something that benefits the team. 
---
The swimmer has nothing. I mean, he just swims.

He's got to contribute something to the team.

WAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Ye

Thanks for the quality pasta!

Any other Saturday workers laughing right now?
---
Can we please consolidate these threads into a "I THINK $15 IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY" megathread please.
---
If you need to be removed from the game in order to do the things you want to do, you may have an addiction.
---
why?
---
They hit Earthfury while I was swimming, so I drowned when I was on land.
---
Is this guy just a speedrunning fan?  Is he going to try some new challenge?

dont give two shits about streamers. go away
---
Stuck not being able to log in, hbu?
---
ARISE! MY CHAMPION!

ye
---
Gotcha, I was playing on Westfall so it might not have been targeted since its not one of the bigger ones. Because I was on it for the past 3 hours.
---
I get it being upsetting, especially on a Saturday when some people cant play until the weekend too. But in general, the servers have been working really well in my opinion.
---
you definitely need a tic tac or somethin’
---
Maybe they're focusing their energy on FIXING THE PROBLEM, more than updating the website?
---
nice
---
O rly?
---
I was looking to no life-ing my mage this weekend after a long and hard work week where I had no time to play....now I have to go outside and enjoy friends and family....fuck these guys
---
Why
---
⛏⛏HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON⛏⛏
---
Gratz, that's huge!
---
I'm playing a Ret Paladin and currently clapping cheeks. I think anybody who knows how to optimize their class can do well, regardless of spec.
---
She’s got him by the balls.
---
We do a lot of things now that we didn’t during our more “animalistic” past, and we’re better off for it. Turns out the best outcomes for people come when they’re raised by 2 parents in a family unit, and that translates to better more functioning society overall.
---
imagine getting out of jail and DDOSing the same patch you DDOSed last time
---
I’m a dwarf though! Everyone likes dwarves! Even horde. 
---
Ok come here bb.
---
No requirement to use, just to attach it.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

NOT TODAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY

that facebook account had a lot of history. More likely they are just that stupid.

ĂĂĂĂĂĂĂĂĂĂĂĂĂĂĂĂHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
---
He's saying he's scared his class will bar him from those parts of the game, ya dingus.
---
My wife gave me the go ahead 😂😂😂 what a whipped ass nibba
---
plenty of attention from the long dick of the law
---
There are Locked chests, and Locked lockboxes.
---
Unless you want to go ahead and start deleting them, thats pretty useful in itself.
---
Sap is good for controlling pulls. They can offtank with evasion, and disable traps.
---
Whatre u talking about..?
---
I just tried to play my first session of WoW classic today since I missed launch by a week, and now servers are down. Is it a sign? Is it my fault?

Wasn't able to test

had to adjust my monocle at this point

Though this is a bummer, I can now finish work and go buy groceries. And eat. And drink, and go to the bathroom.

I think I need to sleep.
---
Yea dude fo sho- I paid for my matrix let me enjoy.
---
Do a whois look up on the domain posted at that twitter...it shows the name address and phone number of the person using tha twitter.
---
Yeah they get attention for a day. But then usually get thrown in prison a couple years down the road when they get caught and suddenly dont think its so funny anymore.
---
Doesnt it have like between 4 and 500?
---
Imagine having a life so good that when your game goes down it ruins your day/weekend.
---
Perspective my friends.
---
I feel like he probably picks the worst times to play and now has to ask. I have a wife and 3 kids, my wife could care fucking less when I sit at the computer as long as the kids and house are calm. I didn't marry my fucking mom.
---
This is bullshit. I helped a mage thru WPL on my paladin on his way to sm. (I am high 50's) and he didnt even thank me. 20 wasted minutes of my life. Id do it again though.
---
You’re still trying to justify being selfish, not a good look. 
---
You knew what I meant when I said profession, arguing the semantics of it is just deflecting and doesn’t absolve you of using your class utility selfishly.
---
But the main pretense on which you are relying is incredibly flawed. Inflation will only affect things bought or sold through players and players only. Many of the biggest sinks of gold will **not** change with gold inflation. Affording your epic mount at level 60 will require a  big investment of gold and that price **wont** change with inflation.
---
You can already see the value of a lot of rare boe raising as the days go by as people have more money that they are willing to spend.
---
Awww this was so genuine
---
Reeeeeeeeeee
---
I don't buy it, I think a human flips a switch. It has never responded correctly to dynamic/emergent service interruptions.
---
Not surprised
---
Rogues really aren't that good, hunters are way more busted. Priests and pallies are also pretty broken. 
---
As for the gearing, it's really unlikely that you're going to fail a twink. The relevant instances can usually be entered long before the level cap. I'm pretty sure you can enter RFD at level 25.
---
And professions are disturbingly scarce.
---
Don’t link that shit. They feed off the hate.

retail is down too

Here it is - all about the game of outside on Youtube:

I have some bad news for you mankirk...
---
Hey, just look at this way, you have happiness outside of the game too with your girlfriend, work, school whatever you're doing.
---
These ddosers? Have none of that. They're script kiddies too at best which means they have no actual knowledge of what they're doing they're using programs OTHER people made to do this because they're too stupid do make their own or learn how to.
---
/roll 0 (1-100)
---
Legion had player numbers close to Wrath's peak, and they previously increased server capacities (causing servers previously showing as "full" or "high" to show as "high" or "medium" with the same number of people) and recently also increased classic server capacities, so I don't think that's the issue
---
When reporting their Twitter account it's going to be hard to select a category.   [https://imgur.com/a/rKf5EMn](https://imgur.com/a/rKf5EMn)

Should move WoW servers to Amazon Web Services .  Issue resolved with AWS
---
I’m happy. I had stuff I should have been doing today. They saved me
---
Where can I get one?
---
HAHAH
---
&gt; the group doing the DDoS was asking on Twitter for the WoW server IP
---
i can feign ignorance also.
---
&gt; It’s a bunch of script kiddies using a rented bot net
---
not denying this is a likely possibility, just saying people can act stupid but be incredibly intelligent.
---
Yes, he swims for a selfish reason, which is to get the 100 dollar bill for himself, which doesn't benefit the team in anyway. The money is for himself, and therefore he swims just for his benefits. 
---
Sure rogue does some DPS. But why bring a lackluster selfish DPS when other classes can do more dps?
---
Someday you may have kids and responsibilities and actually understand how to respect your other half.  That doesn't seem like today.
---
I know very little about network security and DDOS threat mitigation, but you'd think these orgs would have the tools in place to defend against an attack like this. Could it be that this guy has a botnet larger than anyone has seen before and if finally letting it out?
---
Take a nap and play later at night
---
Wand damage is falling off for me around 40. Considering doing the shadowform respec myself at 45, then pushing back into disc.
---
so cool bro
---
love dustin but you already know what time it is...KHABIB TIME! You haf to know dis.
---
Which expansion was that in again?
---
They'll ddos his twitch stream before he climaxes.
---
Lmao get dunked on
---
Script kiddies are the actual worst.
---
He married his mom
---
Imagine not knowing how to take a screenshot in 2019
---
10 mans are 5/h, 20 mans are on 3 days lockout
---
Old Blanchy is a great horse, she doesn't deserve this.
---
Haha, I get why they changed it, but enjoy the original a lot more!
---
I guess it's time to attend to the responsibilities I neglected due to WoW.  
---
Like eating.
---
Tankadin
---
maybe its a falseflag and hes using people as his personal army to fuck with that kid's life? he wouldnt be that dumb to use his fb page the same as twitter
---
Figure out who this guy ends up rooming with in federal prison and I'll send a letter to his roomie saying hes a convicted pedo and problem solved kid never makes it out of prison to try this dumb shit again
---
How in 2019 do people still not know how to take a screenshot.
---
I was telling folks in Westfall chat to report him too before the servers went down. Hope he enjoys prison.
---
I did it at 24. I went through the same thing, ran WC and lost the pants to a lvl 17 warrior and then 3 times they didn’t drop. So I was like what the hell I think I can do this solo. It took me two tries. I snuck in there and fought all the snakes then attacked him. Got him down to half health then switched to heal and he ended up bashing me pretty hard and killed me. I spirit rezzed, flew to thunder bluff and bought a defense potion, an agility potion, and a health pot. Went back snuck in again fully buffed and jumped him. Ended up taking him down. I fought in cat, swapped out took the health pot, full healed then switched to bear form and finished him. It was a tough fight but definitely doable. As mentioned the snakes had to be cleared on a first attempt. I will also mention that I had brawler gloves, the deviate belt, a 7+ stam chest plate, and the blue two handed mace that’s +11 strength and +10 stam so I was pretty geared. I also lucked out and he dropped the pants first attempt. If they hadn’t dropped first try idk how many times I would of attempted that. 
---
TLDR. It’s doable but not easy, definetly need to be relatively geared already.
---
Damn.  That is crazy!
---
ITS UP

Nice! Luckiest chest I’ve seen so far had a 12 slot bag and starfaller in it

Blizzard Employee here.  I can confirm, that we can't confirm if your characters are deleted or not. Thank you for your time.
---
Imagine complaining about down when blizz already stated they were working on it. Games have gone down for weeks due to Ddosing this was an hour. Take it easy we will get to play again soon
---
if you looted it and you saw it in your bag, im pretty positive you will be good.
---
Same bro. We got evacuated from Storm Surge zones for Hurricane Dorian. Brought my family in land with my laptop. Ready to play the game today and whaddaya know?

Pretty cool. What was down the tunnel?

ROFL.  I JUST READ HIS PROFILE.

7 MONTHS AGO asking for basic WP help with security.  He's hosting his mom's website on FUCKING HOST GATOR.

Go away scrub.

This guy posted minutes afterwards, so yes it “just happened” at the time.

That’s pretty fucked for some prison time.. sounds like it’s not worth it ;) LOL. I wonder what kind of coding all these dudes have to go thru

You can acknowledge the event while taking steps to discourage copycats. Check out the parallels with mass shootings: https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_the_media_can_help_prevent_mass_shootings
---
Note, these are very very different forms of attacks and I'm not comparing them in terms of severity, but in how handling them can help influence future events.
---
I really don't understand what you're trying to say. And for what it's worth I'm not an expert on networking, although I probably understand it better than the average person.
---
Servers back up
---
Don't let this distract you from the the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, Bubba "Spare Tire" Dixon.
---
You didn't put any effort into finding anyone or traveling to the dungeon, so people became way more likely to just kick people they didn't like (or who weren't good enough for their liking) , and people started talking to each other less and less through the dungeon, and the interactions were less personal. Runs became more about speed, and judging people on how they contributed to the speed, and less about working together with people who you'd almost definitely meet again. Why go through your friend list to find a dps when you are a tank and get insta-queue anyway? Heirlooms amplified this in lower levels also.
---
Addiction is fun, isnt it?
---
*twitch*
---
Don't think of it this way, think of it as we are coming by in a hard time to make some new friends, we may visit occasionally after, but we will return home when the parents aren't fighting anymore.
---
Blizzard here, this is not true, only your characters were deleted also you're banned from all blizzard games until you buy 50 hearthstone packs
---
ahaha this made me laugh and smile.
---
How do I get back up?
---
Makes you wonder if the Facebook person was the actual target, or if this kid is just that stupid.
---
UP
---
whats sad is they have no ddos mitigation
---
Already started laundry and started morning the lawn. Now for some groceries and lunch while it is still hot out! Gonna feel like a winner with some fabulous freshly laundered bedding tonight.
---
Don't give the DDOS nerds a moment of your anger, boys and girls.
---
GO GO GO GO

See this is just meeting negativity with negativity. You aren't being productive here at all. No one would blame you for taking the mob but being extra dickish about it just shows your immaturity.
---
THEY'RE ON
---
Edit. Not saying I’m expecting compensation at all. For the record, I don’t believe they will at all. This post is rather a discussion.
---
They’re up!
---
WOOT
---
Aaannnddd they're back
---
It's up folks
---
Servers back up...for now.

I feel like once you start smoking you won't care that much tbh.

Clearly I'm talking about the war with Germany, not the war with Japan.  Though I was unclear by not specifying that, the context of the conversation was about killing Nazis.
---
Also new to wow and managed to make it to 40 with warrior. Does mortal strike completely get rid of heroic strike, like should I just take it off my action bar? Also what other abilities aren’t worth using?
---
Feign death is completely broken, 1/10 times it actually does absolutely nothing. Not to mention pet pathing is broken as well.

"It was a prank bro!"
---
Normally I don't defend security flaws but we neither know the exact situation, nor did this happen on a regular basis in the past years. So, as long as it's "only" Denial of Service I'll stay cool and agree with the blue post to not give some blackhead kids too much attention.

Dude learn how to take a screenshot on your computer, nobody wants to see the sad closet you apparently game out of
---
I prefer Spriest and it's my chosen spec- my question is why stay priest and not just go warlock, being that warlock is the class version of a spriest? I think of this cause I know my guild is gonna make me heal which is no me gusta for me. Thoughts?
---
Well shoot, now I just want to take more shots with my camera phone and post them now. ;)
---
No one's forcing players in your group to level mining or skinning either.  If no one ever leveled Lockpicking or Blacksmithing, locked chests would never get opened.  Whether you like it or not, finding a locked chest is no different from a Miner finding an ore node in a dungeon.  Either you feel entitled to both, or neither.
---
They are getting their ass beat by computer hackers.  They can't reveal anything otherwise the enemy would figure out what they are doing.
---
Plus it's hard to find a good job when they know you'll only be there 2 or 3 months max
---
“Life comes at you fast”
---
I’ve seen this build to 40, but what do you want to focus on learning talent wise after 40?
---
Was this on Incendius?
---
Of course my toon is on Fairbanks. Should have took that migration when I saw it last night...
---
Welcome to barrens chat
---
Mind sooth I find very niche. The one where you can see through someone’s eyes is mostly useless. I mean yeah on the quest to 60 you probably use it 4 times. Interesting idea but no real application.
---
Now the one where you take over someone else is hilarious. Make them jump into lava at Mc or jump off a balloon. Or even run into 8 mobs etc. Lots of funny uses.
---
Yes LOL
---
Mods said dont post the link moron.
---
Howdy guildie!! :D
---
gz :)
---
Imagine ddosing Wikipedia and thinking you're cool
---
so their current health % is reduced so a big fall is more likely to kill them? how evil.
---
Reminds me of some of the important goals I had back in Vanilla:
---
1. Literally what you did
---
2. Get the Sword of Omens
---
3. Get a suit
---
4. Get a broom
---
5. Get a pirate hat
---
6. Get the REAL pirate hat
---
7. Fix your rep
---
8. Do the Linken stuff
---
Hardcore parkour!
---
lol I’m just kidding. I don’t have kids. Just my dog.
---
Hunter by far.
---
It's not pirated. In fact, if it was pirated he wouldn't had that message.
---
I spent all day yesterday just doing world pvp after getting mind control. Was a big waste of time, but worth it.
---
Yea forget the streamers who are able to play All day everyday, this is really just effecting the normal players who actually work, have families, and get out of work on time for once on the weekend like this filthy casual, That’s who they’re really effecting. 
---
But agreed, Blizzard gave the correct response let’s just hope they wipe these Scumbags out quick, and prosecute to the fullest extent.
---
Thank God! I have a 200 word essay due next Thursday and I haven't even started!
---
Yes that is why uptime is graded in 0s and not 9s. -__-
---
A wondrous world with blinders on.

---
I have a disability and play by screensharing to my iPad using Splashtop. This is an awesome setup I’m going to have to try.
---
How is the outside? I haven't been in a while.
---
Well now I no longer have an excuse to not do homework or stuff around the house. Maybe I can salvage a bit of my collapsing life now.
---
This confirms Blizzard is aware and likely working with their infrastructure providers to turn on emergency DDOS mitigation without giving enough information to A) tip off the scriptkiddies as to what those mitigation procedures are and B) direct gawkers towards the people responsible, giving them the notoriety that's driving them acting like fucksticks.
---
Correct, not mad. Guy calls me out as triggered with a triggered post. Gotta love it.
---
Ya I think it’s a goofy drawing of the war3 archmage
---
Sure. Some major points:
---
*Recruit from the hardy survivors of a desert death world. I've always thought Fremen would make perfect candidates for Space Marines.
---
*While the importance of water isn't important to a marine, that deep-seated belief carries over to the chapter's geneseed, meaning this chapter is even more zealous about recovering fallen brothers. This results in a larger number of dreadnoughts, as not every one is dead, and as long as you hold the chapter's geneseed in your body, you still serve the chapter.
---
*Chapter Master is chosen by ritual combat. This means the best warrior is always the chapter master, but after a few centuries of inferior (for a Marine) leadership, a tradition was started that the new "Chapter Master" would appoint the 1st Captain "Regent of Sikarra" (the name of the chapter's world), who would perform all the strategic, organizational and logistical work the Chapter Master is supposed to.
---
*Well-rounded followers of the Codex, they do prefer quick, decisive campaigns. Striking suddenly, achieving their objective and leaving the AO before a proper response means that don't do sieges or prolonged engagements, but do have a long list of campaigns they have participated in.
---
*An old chapter, between 4th and 6th founding, they don't know their primogeniture chapter, but they aren't really concerned, as ~8000 years is long enough that it doesn't matter. They have their own traditions and history.
---
I've got a lot of the framework of the chapter worked out, but the name is really blocking me.
---
Lol dat first comment...
---
He's smarter than everyone at blizzard, that's why
---
He's not. He's a tool, plain and simple.
---
Psst.  I'll tell you the secret:
---
Ignorance.
---
They are not hackers their wannabes

Well, I wasn't going to call you out I was just curious myself lol.
---
You think teachers arent working just because the kids are out for 1 week during fall and spring break?
---
Why do you do dumb random shit? Idk man, maybe you’ve never had to work a real job?
---
Yikes there homophobe
---
He can't, the script kiddies will just ddos his twitch too.
---
Idk, I think he deserves jail time equal to what he takes. If that’s 3 hours from 100,000 people, he should get about 34 years in prison.
---
Are you sure it's not just getting resisted?
---
When you buy a game token from Blizzard to sell for Gold... That's buying gold from Blizzard
---
Roll on a PvE server if you don't want the enemy faction to grief you. That's the entire point of a PvP server, we are supposed to hate the other factions guts. I attack any alliance I see, despite if I know I'll lose, because sometimes you win even against the odds. Shit I had 2 level 30s try to gank me while questing, somehow managed to 1v2. That would have been a long ass walk back, a lot longer than ressing and waiting for a boat. But that's what a PvP server is all about. Fuck the other faction and ruin their day as much as possible.
---
You going to say it's griefing when raids lock down a city for hours? Because I got bad news for you..
---
Read up on what a DDOS attack does. Now just look at the symptoms:
---
- Multiple servers becoming slowly unresponsive to the point of being completely unable to service customers(in this case, game servers that can no longer respond to end-point clients due to be overwhelmed)
---
- On top of all that, just compare what's normal operation vs what's happening now. There's obviously a serious issue and it's not one which is confined to a single server or set of systems. Multiple systems are all affected and there's a discernible pattern as to which ones too.
---
- DDOS attacks are sadly becoming more and more common. Bullies relish in taking gaming systems down, especially when it's weekend, or various ideal points in time when everyone wants to play. They delight in causing mischief.
---
Appropriate username.
---
Sweet, the only reason I ask is because I could see a large part of the community complaint that it wasn’t in Vanilla. Hopefully they let it happen though
---
...Thats like a paragraph or two.
---
Hunt them down like the dogs they are, drag them out in the middle of the street and put a fucking bullet in their head! All while streaming it live on Twitch and every other streaming service out there... Then I bet noone else will do this shit ever again.
---
Only 200 words?

You can only wrap items that don't stack.  And apparently ammo.
---
If you're super worried about it, you could renew your router's IP.
---
200?
---
It's far more accurate and allows you to plug in third party modules, you can google specifics on why it's better than recount if you need them.
---
Man, this sucks. Thiis is the first weekend I have had where I can actually play since launch. :(
---
Depends on what you consider "getting your ass beat". Getting sucker punched out of the blue may knock you out, but it isn't really a fair fight.
---
Healing as Enhancement shaman is definitely possible, the important part is to get the right gear. Except for wrists i have a complete caster gear in my bank for when i'm healing dungeons and i never had problems. 37 now, but i will probably switch to elemental somwhere 40-45. After level 40, you can go every point in resto and even endgame 5 man dungeons can be healed with a hybrid specc with only 21 points in resto. Just get some gear, if you have a choice from quest rewards consider taking int gear sometimes, even if it's cloth.
---
My wife suggested something like that. I'm not a fan of the articles in the name. Maybe as a nickname, something the chapter gets referred to as?
---
Thank you, though.
---
Idk, I always have problems with finding Mailbox or flight master on upper lvl and end up running a full circle
---
True that, How about doing "crime" that acculy can make ppl money, instead of wasting the time getting nothing.
---
Have fun in jail UkDrillas xd
---
Did they actually downscale their staff that much? I was under the imrpession Blizzard is huge now
---
Voidwalker, watching his enslaver and master bunny hop off the cliff: :|
---
Well then if they’re transferring out no issues then.... but they stated no server over single digit layers, there will be queues there was in bc too
---
&gt;Guess what, those servers they transferred to became high pop (Mug'Thol in this case) servers because people wanting to play in those guilds will follow.
---
Literally just made my point for me, thanks!
---
You should get a Razer Nagas if you're playing mmorpgs.
---
I can finally paint these Deathwatch models I’ve had sitting at the table.
---
idk what that means.
---
Now adays if you have the funds you can do it, but most people who sell that kind of power (botnets) wont allow you to do big targets due to risks.
---
Yea so smart he's got nothing better to do than post on Reddit like the rest of us peons when the server goes down for 30 minutes.
---
I really like hunter (dwarf), warlock (gnome) and warrior (gnome)
---
Right?? That’s what I thought lol
---
Here's an idea. Instead of trying to be a smart one, how about reading the replies to the very exact post you're replying to, before coming in with the whole "YoU hAvE nO iDeA wHaT YoU'rE tAlKiNg AbOuT".  Maybe remove the stick up your ass while you're at it too. Just a suggestion.
---
that's the joke.
---
I completed them all recently, what do now?
---
Yeah no not even a little bit lol. Teachers work *incredibly hard* and don't get nearly the compensation they deserve.
---
Did a report on the current and coming teacher shortage in America my senior year of high school (2008). Learned a bunch of wild stuff.
---
Sorry am retarded
---
I remember when I played during BC my FAVORITE spell was eyes of the beast as a hunter. I was 12 and super-duper loved animals so that was a part of it, but being able to scout out areas with my ghost cat felt awesome. Plus it was decently useful for pulling mobs in a more controlled fashion. But mostly I just loved running around as my cat. (No surprise that my other main is a druid, lol.)
---
the servers are down and my existence is null (งツ)ว
---
Right, I’m almost 20 and enjoying every second of it
---
Haha - so good
---
Yes any time people group themselves (even if the options are identical) there will be trends and this is a case where the options are very much not identical.
---
No :( I have 60g but I somehow hope I can come up with 40g for when I get this last level XD
---
Yea I'm really trying to immerse myself into Orc RP
---
I whish that I can see from the get go that the server is down.
---
Instead I wait in queue of 15 mints just to get axed after the wait lmao.
---
Next lvl stuff
---
I’m not trippin
---
Oh okay. Thank you for the response.

I have to find my way to the cookbook, I'm maxed at 150/150 rn.
---
Yes, they're really annoying to fight because of the combo of shield, fear, and heals.
---
Ruined my first WC group. Just punks trying to screw up our weekend.
---
a dude in the comments sold that baby for 90 G's!
---
Yeah, you would be wrong about that. I'm pressured to look pretty irl. I want tusks and a permanent scowl when I rp.
---
They are still down, just thought I would make myself feel a little better by tormenting you.
---
I'm waiting until 40 to get my mount then do exactly this. I'm just a lazy bastard and don't wanna walk everywhere
---
Someone needs to find the DDOS hacker and kill...
---
...his waifu pillow.
---
Yeah recently had to work 6 days 11 hours a day starting at 2 am, this was my only free day kinda bummed I didnt make it to an inn
---
You're a real tit, ya know that?
---
It tastes similar to muscles/clams/oysters.
---
MRW i finally get back in from ddos and start playing to only get kicked again https://youtu.be/Oa9c9JBBGxM?t=256
---
Activision is, but the Blizzard division of it isn't that big.
---
So he and his sad friends can get the biggest reaction. They want to be famous or some shit. They live sad misguided lives.
---
Haha thank you!
---
This is epic. If you find someone you are the man lol. Why don’t you get the turtle from wailing caverns?
---
Lowkey just play Horde because I like how the undead look.
---
That's really it.
---
Nice, but right now don’t know if we can 😭
---
Horde more vulgar
---
True but everything is next to each other, no running in the dust with grinding sandy bones for hours. Also forsaken hate sand.
---
I have been gaming with my kids for years.  I travel for work so am gone 10 out of every 14 days, so having a high end lap top has been a life saver.
---
I have played everything from WOW to Fortnite with my sons from wherever I am, while we have a video chat running at the same time.  It's kept me sane on the road and brought me closer to my boys.
---
If anyone ever tells you not to game with your kids, ignore them.  Play anything that interests them.  Hockey with one(I hate skating but whatever he loves it), Fortnite with another, Wow with the other and Magic the gathering with my oldest.
---
It's kept me feeling young, and I hope it keeps them closer to me.
---
Don't call him/them a hacker. It's script kiddies using DDoS bots. It's the lowest class of "hacking". It's not even hacking.. They are probably paying for bots.
---
Why do you equate participating in world pvp as evil and not participating as good, on a pvp realm?
---
I feel like spreading talents like that doesn’t really make any sense. Your better off dumping it all in combat or assassination. Just my opinion.
---
I WAS going to hit 20 on my main, after mandatory overtime.  But now I HAVE to play Hearthstone instead.  Ewww.
---
Yeah but the loot system fixed all the issues I’ve described with ML and group loot.
---
Its about the only improvement I like (besides applying party loot settings to chests in 2.1.0)
---
Little known facts as well on Druids, that not enough people know:
---
- They have Hibernate which is a 20 second CC. While it only works on beasts, many is the player/raider who has no idea that this is a thing.
---
- Soothe Beast reduces the range which beasts which attack you  by 10 yards. Definitely underrated spell and almost certainly not known.
---
- Rogues aren't the only class that can stealth in and gather nodes...druids can do that too! Handy in many a dungeon.
---
- As a druid you also potentially compete very differently for gear vs the others. Rings, cloaks, and accessories are all hot-button topics but at least you won't ever be rolling on cloth(after all, we're considerate enough to clothies first dibs, and then ask later if it's OK that we need for our healing set). You would think that warriors of all things love to see druids in their group.
---
Am not happy
---
We can attach it through the trade window like an enchantment. Trade them the spike, then open another trade and put your shield in "will not be traded."
---
Note that this will replace any enchantment you have on the shield.
---

He was saying the pally is auto attack and 1 button
---
its not actually they seem to be adults and are apparently paying a third party to do it for them
---
So I should ride out fury then.
---
wow people are really still telling this 'joke' in 2019
---
Some oe you people really need to reevaluate your lifes. Some of this shit is just sad to read
---
And then 800 if you get pvp rank 3 I believe.
---
&gt;virtual terrorists 
---
Lmfao oml, new twitter bio
---
What hackers?  A distributed denial of service attack doesn't imply that any of blizzards servers are compromised.  And please don't reply telling me that spamming a bunch of people via email with links to malicious payloads to install a DDoS bot on their computers is hacking.
---
Time to Super bum your SO!
---
It's 100 degrees outside.
---
Are you on kiritonos? Just had my first and 2nd WC groups get fucked
---
People like this deserve to suffer. I don't care that it is just a game, taking away something others enjoy for your own amusement makes you unworthy of oxygen imo.
---
Classic as fuck.
---
just play bfa guys :)
---
*salivates in Tidal Charm*
---
Hahaha. I like it.
---
Almost guaranteed these people behind this got ganked and then paid an actual professional to ddos someone
---
Not saying it is the case here, but if you ddos'd a hospital's servers....that would be on par would it not?
---
Should i come back in a few hours? Im just now seeing the issues.
---
Truly classic
---
I see that now. I read

I know I can't 😅😭

Over twelve years old at least based on the YouTube video upload date.

Yea and I'll be one of the ones complaining I really dont want to do engineering
---
huge in revenue, small is staff. That's how you are successful in the stock market my g
---
What do you mean? What’s different?
---
Blizzard themselves confirmed it on twitter recently.
---
Shit, I took two tabs expecting a trippy grind fest but honestly soaking up sun at the pool is a better trip anyways. I’ve been playing everyday anyways.
---
As someone who works in the tech industry, I am even less surprised by your original comment.
---
You don't have to spend hours out of your way in boring ass places to be able to heal. It's more akin to having the group roll on a mining node and the miner has to dig it up and give it to whoever won.
---
Ive been trying to get humar the pridelord for twelve hours. Its not happening. This is the next best thing right now.
---
200 words? That's like 30minutes top
---
That is awesome-sauce!
---
Meh just give him/them attention, they all going to jail anyway. And them keep doing this will only increase the chance of that happening.
---
I don't know why people keep yelling that it's DDoS.
---
1) It's not confirmed that it even is DDoS
---
2) I've seen a lot of people get super angry because they think someone else is maliciously doing it. Thinking of it in that manner is just going to make people angry when we really don't need to me. I'm just looking at it as the servers happening to be down for the time, no DDoS being involved at all, and y'all should as well.
---
Alliance is nicer and Horde is funnier.
---
Imagine a world where you’re such a normie you don’t understand his stream jokes at this point. Get over yourself. No one cares.
---
But it’s raining out
---
I’m chronically ill and have maybe an hour in the afternoons where I feel up to sitting at my desktop, and these virgins burned that hour for me today. I hope they burn
---
I know your pain. My girlfriend tried to take the opportunity to have sex with me too, but i told her i couldn't risk not being there when servers came back up.
---
Yup. Can confirm. My dad embarasses me every day in this game in front of our guildies.
---
Blizz's plan all along!
---
How do we know servers are down from ddos attacks ?
---
Risky play, Blizz is big enough that the FBI will probably get involved since it's all a huge violation of the CFAA and Blizzard is rich.
---
So good to watch hahahaha well done!  
---
Btw, what are your addons? I wanted to have my bars like yours, but I can't find working addons, same for the DPS meter.
---
Allies are gay. It is known.
---
I feel your pain, I got hit right during the final boss escort...
---
Been playing on horde for years til I got married. Having an SO opened my mind and pulled me out of that edgy angsty loser mentality that horde players have. 
---
Now I just play on the better blue faction
---
Every man's a king on his own ship.
---
I'm on DD. Feel like this is hitting everybody. I can sometimes get in, screw around in stonetalon, then my pet stops following me. That's when I know it's over.
---
Right?!?! Like this is reposted like 6 times a day lately.
---
My first time playing as alliance this go around... I always made fun of little fairy alliance players for being crybaby children. As it turns out, everyone that plays this game is a crybaby child gamer at heart regardless of faction.
---
K boomer
---
I thought priest leveling was slow until I learned what a wand was.. haha priests are actual machines at leveling
---
Can’t use it in combat :/
---
You’re not even a girl
---
Full Classic experience
---
No. I’m 20, female, and play for the horde. I don’t think most of us give a shit what our character looks like, we just wanna play the game
---
The classic servers run at a slower tick rate, so it currently doesn't work unless timed to the tick rate.
---
I think they will fix it up eventually but as of now it only works like 1/5 of the time.
---
Take rez sickness it will take you about 5 to 10 mins to reach a dungeon anyways
---
TBC isn’t classic tho...lol! Get hazed scrub.
---
That is badass, makes me like the tier even more!
---
Thanks for helpin, take care golden one.
---
So he must have two accounts?
---
It was more than just a comment about the drop in hunters and rise in warriors.
---
You still have to respec for raids and probably some end game dungeons.
---
Is this traced?
---
if you dont like him, dont watch him. Crying about him on reddit means you are a dickless loser.
---
Good think 3s cast heals heal the tank for 70% of his health
---
This brought a smile to my face.
---
When you see an enemy rogue go stealth: I've never met u, but I know you're a bastard
---
Is it a great way to make gold then?
---
What!? As a shaman I need this.
---
Have I let you down before?
---
If people DDoS'ing a MMO is what ushers in the era of world wide Starship Troopers style fascism it will truly be the best timeline.
---
I've noticed another big big problem for many tanks. 
---
They use a 2h weapon while questing so when they tank the 1h weapon skill is like (180/210) so they just hit glancing blows and generate no threat.
---
Damn, even a hunter pet was a better tank than the shitty warrior yesterday who tried to tank in berserker stance.
---
Looks pretty solid. Is there any addon integration for it that you know of?
---
Kek
---
Well, it probably wasn't. But luckily it doesn't affect me. I play warrior and I'll dps if someone else wants to try tank. Otherwise, /2 tank lfg for me
---
Are there addons that address it? UI stuff like that is certainly something the community can/has helped with
---
Appears so.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-us
---
Now do Priest.  ;)
---
do you mean ghostlands? area above plague lands is ghostlands and then you have the blood elf area from burning crusade and further up is the quel'dalas or what ever it was called. if it is the thing that is connected to stratholme then it might be the area where Naxxramas hangs in the naxx update in vanilla phase 6 i think. not 100% sure on all this info except the locked zones above.
---
lol i jumped into one of those chimneys as a gnome but it lets me walk right out of the small fireplace opening at the bottom
---
The problem is, they keep doing this because it works, 
---
Activision has more to lose not being accessible than they have to lose by paying these people. It's not a problem it's going away anytime soon.
---
"wanna join the party?" = "omg you cant sit with us!"
---
I made my way to STV for the first time last night at level 30 and was jumped by a 34 shaman. 
---
Absolutely ruined him. Feared him, dotted him, mind flay to slow him and stun him once or twice with black out.
---
He dun' goofed
---
this is actually a good movie you should check it out if you have time :DDDDDD
---
Lol Chromie is likable, even if I hate Gnomes.
---
That was so fucking satisfying.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
In my server the Alliance always attacks in packs or when theyre 5+ levels higher. Where is the honor in that?
---
I'd like to point out something different than the other replies here..:
---
***You only hear about the attacks that aren't stopped***.
---

It wouldn't be petty, and the internet is subject to international laws as well. There won't be an issue putting him/her in prison once found. Very few countries are just lax about their cyber-terrorism laws. Don't worry.

Im sorry. I broke the game when I farmed too many goretusk livers (Its amazing how many goretusk are living without a liver btw).
---
Unfortunately one was camping the GY too
---
IMO They're stereotypes and anyone who tells you otherwise just hasn't played on both sides to the same extent. For example all my friends who say "Alliance are nicer" tend to only be involved in the Alliance RP crowd and then do raiding and M+ on Horde. But as someone who has done both? Nah, both sides have dicks and both sides have great people, and in equal amounts.
---
Calling DDoS "hacking" is like calling mugging somebody and taking their wallet "pickpocketing"
---
lol typical horde ganker
---
Whatever happened to sapping and sheep pulling?
---
Likely there wouldn't be a good time: if you're raising kids together you give up a lot of yourself and your relationship - if you want to game you are probably choosing to put your spouse or your children or your work to the side. If your partner says "hey, I'll do these chores / take the kids/ whatever instead of you for a few hours tonight because I love you and I know how hard you work for everyone and I want you to do something fun just for yourself." You get excited about that and post it on reddit.
---
I think you're finding it hard to empathize with people who have a different lived experience to your own.
---
Wily is in the pocket of big gnome.
---
Be an honor to report that guy.
---
We weren't even in combat and I still couldn't charge. This shit has been happening alot when I'm not in combat and my charge still won't work.
---
hahaha yeah i just played oblivion :p
---
I was a panda baby so have absolutely no nostalgia goggles and I couldn't agree more.
---
I've had an unbelievable amount of fun leveling! 
---
The classes have so much flavour, the world feels big again, it's wonderful
---
Auctioneer is finally out for classic and I just scanned my auction house right before the DC
---
People seem to forget that DDoS mitigation =/= DDoS immunity. I highly doubt Blizzard of all companies doesn't have notable protection in place.
---
And how some have evolved to not even need one
---
Not being able to play because I'm out of town for the weekend, I laugh at you all. Ha! Haha!
---
My favourite part so far is that I bumped into a mage whilst playing and we did a few questions together. 
---
10 levels later, I bumped into them again. 
---
I love the continuity of the people we are now surrounded with.
---
De-ranking spells is huge for mana efficiency in vanilla honestly.
---
They also provide facts to the masses that many despot governments find very inconvenient.
---
Probably not, it was made during vanilla and I don’t think it’s ever been updated all the addons he suggests are outdated I believe. I’ve never used addons at all and never had an issue following this guide fwiw
---
Yeah I've enjoyed this conversation. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to think about why I think the things I think.
---
It sounds like you're more putting yourself in the shoes of the rogue and thinking what you think the right thing to do would be from that point of view, and you're right, that really changes how I'd think about it too. If I put myself in the shoes of the rogue, I'd definitely share it. At the same time, in the shoes of a party member, I wouldn't fault the rogue for taking it for themselves, either.
---
I think at the end of the day, both sides of the argument have merit, and I'd just leave it up for the rogue to decide, because I really don't care all *that* much. I found it to be a very interesting ethical thought experiment, though.
---
I'm about to cum
---
Lemme know if you find Mankrik's wife under the bed.
---
Just teach your son to grind mobs and boom. Easy leveling while getting some painting done lol.
---
Anddd back down?
---
H
---
I dont know but hes not going to do well in prison
---
If that happens hope they don't live with their mom
---
soo.... how bout giving players an extra bit of game time?
---
Stuck on a zep as of 2:13 PST. Something still fucky
---
Mind Flay starts to scale well with rank 3 (lvl 36) so instead of wanding, for just 100 mana, you do a bit more damage and kill it quicker.  Unless you got a really nasty wand.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Whitemane seems to have gone down again
---
I throw them off for failing the Darwin test and see if they can manage treading water.  I imagine it would be hilarious to park them on the edge and watch them run off when MC ends.
---
I dont watch him, and I’m responding to you being arrogant. Prime example of a typical asmon viewer. How are faeralina queues?
---
Uh yeah you do? I play both Ally and horde
---
People realized a long long time ago that the game isn't that hard.
---
Sounds about right
---
I'm reading through these stories and seeing a lot of horde douches.
---
You have low standards if you think -4 fake internet points is considered getting “dunked on”
---
They're already back up, have fun out there NERD.
---
pedant
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Going to work...  Dx
---
It does indeed, but then there is no in combat mana regen after the 5 second rule, and it drains 100 mana pr second.
---
I love a good family reunion.
---
Whitemane has no queue right now.. But there is no character available either =\]
---
Morgraine had a migraine.
---
Imagine watching so much asmongold that u know his "jokes" by heart and then trying to make fun of someone because they don't watch that toxic ghoul
---
Now we know this is a lie.  Players don't post on reddit.  Reddit is for people that can't get in.
---
I think you got the last part backwards from your first part.. but I still get it.
---
Unless it's present in PvP it doesn't seem to be present in PvE.  I can keep an NPC fear locked for ages.
---
They hacked my 60 in full epics back to a broke ass level 29 in shit gear!
---
I mean, this is the real vanilla experience.
---
So make three more buddies then you have a full group.
---
Your alt is level 35?
---
Damn
---
I wish blizzard had just built in away to avoid ganking completely to give players who don't enjoy world pvp a way to experience the game in a way they are comfortable. Smh
---
Well, yes. However you use the pummeler at the start of the fight before combat to get the buff, then put your main weapon on. You don't fight with it equipped lol
---
We used these kinds of addons in vanilla soooo #MyClassic
---
Aka he just hit level 60 and is trying to sell the account
---
You left a few words from the dictionary out of that sentence, bud.
---
I remember A 5 boxer in vanilla who used shamans. Would run around Alterac Valley PVP and just one shot people with that op shock.
---
Who cares man, I want out and I don't want the account to sit empty
---
Which is what they're doing based off Blizzard's tweets, so there was pretty much nothing Blizz could've done to defend against the issue lol
---
Just like how we have to keep getting Flu shots, the ways they work can always change. DDoS is a bit simpler when talking in the realm of "hacking" (which honeslty DDoS isn't even hacking) so it won't require as much of frequent check ups as vaccinations.  
---
It's not just Blizzard. PSN, Xbox Live, Origin, Uplay, there have been a ton of services getting supposed DDoS' for the last few years.
---
I wasn't aware at how badly this was being executed when I posted that.
---
You didn't read.
---
They probably will when they get sent to jail
---
Just a typical ganker overall especially one who tries to gank when the player is half hp fighting mobs.
---
You are in the Maelstrom. You toon will be available when cata classic launches in 4 years
---
Always.
---
It’s against the tos but totally doable people trade accounts and sell them every day just be careful
---
I've heard, much like saving a fairy by clapping, you can fix WoW servers by flapping. Soooo let's go everyone! Do your part!
---
Now I regret disenchanting...
---
These people are pathetic.  I hope they land in PMITA prison, soon!
---
Can confirm this for sulfuras. The same two alliance camp the side of hillsbrad for days, horde gets ganked all the time. Then the &lt;GOON SQUAD&gt; rolls in like a red wave and kills all the alliance in the whole area
---
&gt;ruining other people’s fun
---
I mean it’s fun doing mind control shenanigans and ganking lowbies repeatedly but making sure nobody can play is pretty vile.
---
You really trying to kinkshame the Horde like that?
---
It's completely idiotic for sure.
---
Can u link them plz?
---
The people who killed you over and over again will never see this
---
Not wrong...
---
Nah my little dude, [this](https://imgur.com/a/RdCa8JF) is getting dunked on.
---
Name is virgins play horde- should be virgins post on reddit to grief warcraft players
---
Destro doesn't benefit most skills you use farming.  Sbolt and immolate are both pretty mana inefficient, which means more downtime... although a lot of the time you still use immolate, it makes more sense to make corr/coa stronger at the expense of immolate.
---
How is it better?  I said you'd lose hours, which is true.  Sorry I didnt use the exact words *you* wanted me to.  I'm sure destro can kill mobs faster.  But then you have to deal with the downtime.  It's not all a matter of TTK.
---
Why don't you spend your hard earned money playing in a pve server? You'll never have to cry again
---
This. It is rather difficult to explicit deny to the attackers without catching players in the crossfire. If alot of the requests are coming from the same place, maybe, but in this type of attack they are generally coming from thousands of different locations making it hard to determine the difference between legitimate and non-legitimate requests.... if you take the servers down, it makes it easier to identify these connections. 
---
Good luck to the Blizz IT sec team or their third party Security team with handling this, just glad its all quiet for me this weekend :P
---
The alleged DDOS attacker said he wouldn't bring down Mograine... so why not everyone just go over load the server in retalation by logging into it as well?
---
I have control, I play about 4 hours a day but I still don't want to play that much. Essentially I want someone else to play rather than me
---
Imagine going to jail for DDoSing a video game.  Woof.
---
Or...I could just play on Classic. :)
---
((And hopefully, Blizzard will keep a few classic servers around.))
---
Conjugal visits?  Not that I ever heard of.  They say the trick is that on the first day you need to either kill someone or become someone's bitch.
---
You're fucking retarded if you roll on a pvp server and claim that being ganked and camped isn't what you're paying for
---
Whatever you do, and to a lesser extent on reddit. Don't talk about it. The people going to twitter and responding them are rewarding them with the exact thing they came for. Let the courts deal with it. Blizzard has won and had people sent to jail over this in the past.
---
pls stop bullying whitemane
---
No one can enforce an agreement like that.
---
Well... it depends.
---
15 years ago DDoS attacks spelled doom pretty quickly. Now though...
---
Normally DDoS attacks are pretty easy to identify and redirect.  That's why Anonymous has started to rely on other socio-technical tactics like providing parallel internet connections to populations under martial law, or hacking individual politician's data to leak corruption details (sometimes even work with law enforcement on pedophile rings, that kind of thing).
---
So in this day and age if someone wants to execute a successful DDoS they can't just attack a company or their web servers, they have to find some kind of at point weakness in the infrastructure for a service and then aim their DDoS attack at that.
---
Most criminal hackers don't bother with DDoS because stealing data is both more reliable and faster. Plus it's only a matter of time before a company/service provider finds where the attacks are aimed at, and then they fix that weakness.
---
Well, due to the error code Blizz is reporting, it looks like the WoW classic DNS resolver servers are being targeted. It's also why the asshole apparently leading the attack can target individual realms. Each realm would have it's own DNS name and IP Address combination. Probably even it's own DNS server due to the sheer amount of traffic WoW handles.
---
Blizz should have everything behind a switch fabric and a load balancer solution like F5 networks or Palo Alto or Splunk. So hopefully if they do, they can tune those technologies to ignore the repeated spam requests that make up a DDoS.  But it may take some time.
---
Personally I would have used Splunk's request pattern resolver architecture because LOIC (Low Orbital Ion Cannon DDoS software) can do absolutely nothing to DNS servers with that kind of monitoring.
---
Source: WAN and Security Engineer.
---
With modern tech it's usually pretty easy to prevent DDoS attacks, so either Activision/Blizz didn't decide to do due diligence to be able to prevent it or the hacker has some kind of insider knowledge into the Classic server infrastructure so they can bypass a lot of the security involved.
---
Cisco Nexus switch fabrics for example can auto redirect mass requests to a loopback interface so DDoS attacks go nowhere. Brocade Core switch stacks also can do this because they're rocking a similar Unix kernel to Cisco. There's a couple of other solutions available through F5, PaloAlto, SolarWinds, Juniper Netowrks, etc... but they only work if A/B has purchased licenses for them and configured them properly.
---
Edit/Update:
---
Looking through the twitter account of the attacker, they're also claiming to be involved in the Wikipedia attack by attacking the AMX-IX infrastructure.
---
If what the hacker claims is true, then Activision (Not blizzard because Activision is providing the WAN mass infrastructure for Call of Duty and Blizz is piggy backing off of it due to the partnership arrangement) is probably also using AMX-IX to spread their bandwidth consumption over multiple ISP's all over the globe.  I wouldn't necessarilly rely on one service like that, unless they had a DDoS filtering service provider contract. And I would regularly have my Network Security Operations Center stress test them with a DDoS designed to specifically see if the contract is being lived up to.
---
AMX-IX uses multiple DNS resolvers to spread traffic across lots of different IPS's all over the world.  So I'm betting somewhere involved in the attack is a disgruntled AMX-IX employee who's either providing the attackers access, or the information about AMX-IX's infrastructure to be able to attack them and bring down individual communication streams.
---
OR:
---
AMX-IX hasn't ever either been attacked like this or never bothered to stress test their own systems to see if something like this was possible (I have managed contracts with companies in third world countries before, this is sometimes the case, but certainly not always. It's often a problem with US companies/Government agencies all over the world as well).
---
Either way companies that suffer from this kind of thing often loose so many of their contract customers so quickly that they go out of business or are bought out by a competitor.
---
Perspecta suffered from a similar kind of limitation (Not an attack) that caused too much interruption in their customer's WAN infrastructure about a year ago and had to do a sizable lay off to survive the contract losses.  IHC becoming one of Perspecta's customers helped rescue them from collapsing, and they've been doing steadily better ever since from the looks of things.
---
I am back on right now!
---
depends on your level. Right now, I'm doing Mind blast-SW:P-run back a bit-mind flay, wand.
---
Yeah, and the disenchanting values are incorrect. Seems as if they’re working to update it asap, just takin a while.
---
Great for builds / gear/ rotations.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/](https://classic.wowhead.com/)
---
Dungeon guides / locations / gear / builds
---
Also ask community in game, people are usually pretty good at passing on good tips :)
---
that's it.. i'm filing a complaint through the customer service-- i've had enough
---
It's not a troll. Use your fucking brain. Do you understand how difficult it is to get a botnet with millions of people? We're talking worldwide scale.
---
They're in it for profit. This is an advertisement to anyone looking to purchase a DDoS.
---
During levelling tho
---
So you can't control yourself, got it
---
An amazing hunter bow dropped just before the D/C, everyone for it and I won. But then it wasn't showing up in my inventory just before the servers went down.
---
Control + C 
---
Control + V
---
That's not interacting.
---
That's a 7/5 if I've ever seen one.
---
I am 3 bars from 40. I'm gonna have to wait until tomorrow to hit 40 because a script kiddie wanted some attention. Durnit.
---
**I hope the game time subscriptions that people paid for won't get penalized and the company will re-compensate the players with the difference of the time lost due to the attack. I don't like getting penalized for something I paid for only getting penalized with time and money lost with no way of getting it back.**
---
Gotcha, thank you.
---
What’s happening right now at Blizzard is that some handful of poor on-call engineers noticed an incident. Then they noticed it was bad, and that they’d be working way more today then they hopped. After that they escalated it, dragged in more of their coworkers from their relaxing weekends. Right now there’s probably some sweating, a lot of chat rooms and conference calls and updates to product owners perhaps VPs if this continues.
---
They’re certainly not sitting on their hands.
---
Source: Working on-call sucks, but it’s becoming hard to escape in tech.
---
**I hope our game time subscriptions that we paid for don't get penalized due to the ddos attack. Hopefully the company with compensate us with the difference of the time lost. I don't like getting penalized and losing time and money for something that's out of my control.**
---
&gt; witter used the same
---
Trump?
---
I wanna go for a walk but my headphones are busted. How do you walk without music/podcasts?
---
Wait, Distract has an effect on enemy PLAYERS???
---
Well then, too bad.
---
Are there any other games you enjoy that you could try in the meantime? I know my backup game is always Stardew Valley, but also sometimes Civ 6, Diablo 3, or kerbal space program
---
Did I break the server from turning in quests too fast?
---
Nope, a 23 lvl mage. Started 3 days ago
---
I like this comment, makes wow classic seem like a nice warm pie with a scoop of ice cream on top.
---
Any idea of what level to truck on to before I try out other stuff?
---
Just when I finally got a group for the elite quests I have to do ☹️
---
It's basically easy money if you macro it to all of your abilities, but you really don't get all that much out of it.
---
I was 15 when the game came out. I am, well, much older now. I work hard hours and scrape by, and this is the first weekend off I've had in months.
---
I just started my first WC group when the attacks started. I'm... Aghast. Some fucking people.
---
lol you tell that dumb bitch.
---
Alright so since you can’t do math in your head let’s think about this:
---
If there is no layering, we need a little less than 6 times the servers
---
Let’s say there’s 10k at peak (obviously way low) on a server currently. So if we split this up, there would be ~1.6k peak.
---
1 month later, peak goes down by half. Now instead of the 10k players, there’s 5k. But since we sliced them in 6s, there’s only 0.8k.
---
So now you have less than a 10th of the players on each realm. And that would be best case scenario for High pop realms. Low pop realms would be absolutely destroyed 
---
“We’ll just don’t make too many realms” Blizzard can not accurately gauge how many players will be on what realms when before they’re made. They don’t have precognition. 
---
So yeah, after the first month when people slow down playing, we’re back to a ton of transfers to keep realms alive. It would really suck to ruin communities of realms when everyone pm agrees that classic is good because of the realm community.
---
Also, layering has no effect on queues. The economy will be good for buyers, and that’s the extent of the exploits. The benefits of layering outweigh the cons of ‘people will complain that classic isn’t vanilla’ versus forcing server xfers later.
---
Having a thread devoted to death threats and wishes of death over a videogame does make you a baby, yes.
---
Nah I don't think it'll take long. This is probably expensive for him
---
I don't really get why you have to make it about penis size when you could just point out what a childish asshole he's being.
---
You're the one who thinks questing is the only thing to do in WoW then gets triggered when someone says it's boring. Take a step back and look at how retarded you sound.
---
your envy is hilarious
---
Sux only having time to play on weekends and some kids do this... Shame...
---
May have to dive into another game. You're right.
---
The attacks usually target general web services that Blizzard would use/rely on vs attacking individual servers, therefore its somewhat out of Blizzard's hands directly. They work with the service providers to attempt to resolve it in a manner of ways but I don't think it has ever been clear on what all protection levels they have put in place against this type of thing. 
---
There are some extreme ways to deal with  this but it would often cause problems with game play being so easy to log in to servers and continue to play.
---
A lot of the best hope that people seem to have against something like this is that after the fact the perpetrators are caught and heavily punished, to pose a warning to those who try it in the future.
---
Same on a boat but the loading bar stops at like 95% and sits there.
---
Image your kid commiting felonies worth 20 years in prison.
---
then play on a pve server lmao
---
That’s classic
---
WTF?
---
No. Nobody "pay$up" over a DDoS. What a shit term, and even shittier idea. There is not some "hole in [their] backdoor". This is just a *shitload* of traffic coming in the front door. That's what a DDoS is.
---
Paying to stop it only encourages it.
---
Yes but blizzards actual team is small.  Jesus man it's not that hard to comprehend what I'm saying
---
On the flipside Pornhub is experiencing a DDOS of their ... if you know what I mean
---
Hugh Jackman did it to save his daughter from his drug addict/porn star wife.
---
How is this typically resolved? I'm guessing it's not as easy as blocking the requests being spammed from the attacker's IP address or the servers would be up already.
---
How do you trace the email if it’s just a junk email address
---
blah the one realm i have with characters
---
Lost a draw (both rolled 81) to a Warlock who rolled later than me and whose name started with U compared to my L.
---
I’d say it’s a second roll in the background or hidden decimals.
---
Dude, it doesn't matter.  He/they have gotten so much attention, their next big thing in life is going to a pound-me-in-the-ass prison where the internet tough guy life is going to impress nobody while they're bent over saying "Next!"
---
Tooxxxxxiiiiicccccc
---
I group with some people. They kicked me and invited someone else
---
I tagged it first, they were not happy.
---
Is this a common thing???
---
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
---
1 in 10,000.
---
The starting number doesn't matter. But to have two exactly consecutive follow up rolls to any original roll is 1/100 each time. So 100 x 100 = 10,000.
---
Don't, you do not know if this is the person behind the attacks, all people like you are doing is getting a potentially innocent person doxxed. Who would use their own information and picture while publicly staging an international DDOS attack on a multinational company? Think dude.

Pretty good analogy!
---
Also, even if you hired more doormen and knew of a tell between robots and humans, you’d need a hell of a lot of door men to inspect the people to a point where it’s not economically viable.

Even if you did... the highway that the robot are taking can also be congested before the even reach the door when attacks are big enough!

No you can play much sooner with support than without it. The end result is very different.
---
Warriors almost have to tank with a 2h pre 60, because they can’t generate the threat needed to tank with a s&amp;b. The reality of what you’re asking for is you’ll have a tankier warrior that is tanking nothing because he can’t hold agro. My friends heal 2h warrior tanks just fine, but they downgrade their spells and know how to conserve mana.
---
Send nodes.
---
I mean, I find it entertaining to slaughter every single gnome on sight, but I think that's your punishment for playing a filthy gnome on a PVP server. 
---
But stuff like this? This is insane, it's petty nonsense. Like my petty nonsense is at least PART of the game. And I wont spawn camp you, I kill you once and move on... This guy has been going at it all day now. Disrupting a paid servers for millions of people... for... shits and giggles? When nobody asked for it? And the best bit is, it's probably not even his code, he probably stole his mom's credit card to buy someone else's tools to do it.
---
It does require some, regardless of how much of a turd this individual is.
---
I have a feeling you're projecting your own lack of time management onto someone who actually tries to better their life :) I pity you, hope you can change

Bank.  One in every city as everyone else has said.
---
Also, if you cant afford bag upgrades inside your bank, make a new character, and mail it to them.  You can put that stuff in their bank.
---
It's known as a "bank alt" and, with the cost of postage at 30 copper per item, is pretty much free.
---
Just got into Kritonos at 4:49
---
Yeah. League beta was somehow even worse than any DDOS attack. Had only a few playable hours per day for up to a week at a time, 2-3 weeks out of the month
---
That's a valid point, i only ever leveled on a private server to 60 but didnt do much endgame. But in my experience, the ones who are a bit smug about it tend to think anything but the absolute most optimal is bad and those are the ones that somehow others listen to
---
Outside? 
---
Like in... out of instance?

Their mothers didn't give them any attention when they were young so they're desperate for any kind of attention now

Have they used unlawful violence against you, and/or do you feel intimidated? Also, what is the political aim?
---
Why is Tweeter allowing this person to keep posting? they should have their Account banned, they are doing it all for attention and tweeter is giving them a platform. I'm pretty sure that they arent suposed to let people broadcast criminal acts.
---
What? They're being DDOS'd.
---
&gt;Destro doesn't benefit most skills you use farming.  Sbolt and immolate are both pretty mana inefficient, which means more downtime... although a lot of the time you still use immolate, it makes more sense to make corr/coa stronger at the expense of immolate.

Confirmed, you have no idea what you're talking about.

As if those things are equivalent? Lmao.

Well, that escalated quickly.

I can imagine all the devs dressed up in robes and gowns hiding in the castle with the servers, J. Allen Brack gazes down upon the ramparts donning a crown and raising a scepter

I got in for a bit after recovering my body from a death during a DDoS, got murdered by 4 separate players 5+ levels higher than me, and then the server went down again.

He is a well known former exploit seller. ie he negotiated the sale of 0 day exploit from anonymous hackers to corporate and government entities. Now is is mostly a consultant and writer, but he used to live in this sort of gray area that governments tolerated because he provided them a service.

you act like its a super easy fix that takes 2 minutes to do. it does not happen very often because there are a lot of safety protocols to stop attacks like this but some are extremely powerful. there is a reason this is a federal crime.
---
Ahh gold old glitch exploring. Hyjal and caverns and top of Org all the rest
---
They heard you get laid in prison and are too scared to commit an actual crime to get there.
---
Yeah dude my friend and I finally managed to knock out Farmer Getz in Hillsbrad, we’ve been trying to find him forever. It was a good half hour.
---
Essentially to harvest the salt of our tears.  That's really it.  They just get off on being an inconvenience.
---
No you weren't.
---
Sap doesn't break stealth tho?
---
Lmao you're on the same thread on the same gaming subreddit as me discussing the same things. But yeah because you were wrong and I was right *now* you don't care. You obviously cared enough to comment.
---
A lot of rogues have no idea how to play against a warrior. Hell most probably don't even know (or remember) the deadzone or how to bleed kite one.
---
Bruh
---
Yeah if I was a girl I'd love it if my boyfriend was a uhh... WoW Streamer watcher / hacker who Ddosed online games played by like 30 year old men as revenge. 
---
She's a real lucky lady.
---
Well at least this happened to me on a day I have to work
---
Well, no. you get herods shoulder on your warrior, and then transmog on your lvl 2 hunter.
---
Because they're dumb kids making dumb decisions.
---
Is it up right now?
---
The jackass doing this is gonna be forgotten in the time it takes to finish a BFA dungeon.  Can't wait to get back in and grind!
---
Real story is twatter giving platform to terrorists.
---
We get signal. Main screen turn on.
---
The dude even asked for server ip's like a fucking idiot. Clearly knows nothing other than how to push buttons.
---
Literally, back in the day of Diablo 2, my grandmas friend Sandy called. My grandma answered, I got disconnected and I picked up the lan line just to hear what they were gonna talk about. Sandy asked my grandma if they were still going out for lunch tomorrow, my grandma said yes and the 10 second conversation was over.
---
True... I got disconnected 😥
---
Please help me ive stooped so low to watching batman forever on tbs
---
they dont have to be "linked together". they just all have to know which server/s to target. Getting the all the nodes either maliciously or throuch cloud providers is the hard part. Actually initiating the attack is pretty simple
---
/facepalm
---
"BooHoo! TAKE MY ACCOUNT BECAUSE ITS TAKING TOO MUCH OF MY TIME AND I CANT STOP! NO YOU HAVE A LACK OF TIME MANAGEMENT, NOT ME! I PITY YOU! BUT SERIOUSLY PLEASE TAKE MY ACCOUNT SO I CAN STOP PLAYING A VIDEO GAME NO ONE IS FORCING ME TO PLAY! BooHoo!"
---
I thought I was going crazy assuming we already had it. Was very confused by my obstinate keys.
---
Changing an IP doesnt solve anything my dude. Your client has to communicate with the servers which exposes the IP regardless.
---
Just leave it, as truefloating said there's thousands of guilds. They're all effectively have the same goals. It would be one thing if the cancerous member was kicked but if that doesn't happen its time to pack up.
---
You’re literally entitled to a product or service if you pay for it. Read a book. Don’t be illiterate.
---
Three clips. Three. For a person who has 100,000+ ACTIVE viewers watching him play the game this sub is for you shouldn't be surprised that there is content about him here. I'd be surprised if there weren't more than three.
---
&gt; Keep in mind that while yes, they are Blizzards servers, they are probably owned by either Amazon, Google, or a handful of smaller players.
---
I don't think so. Given that they have an opening for a [Data Center Admin](https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/openings/o5ANafwm), which handles the physical location; [reported numbers of some 20,000 servers](https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-server-infrastructure-is-in-use-at-Blizzard-for-World-of-Warcraft); and [auctioned-off hardware](https://www.pcgamer.com/these-players-loved-their-wow-servers-so-much-they-bought-the-old-hardware/), the extent of their AWS, et al usage (if any) is for trivial things like their websites, not for the main game servers, if for no other reason than it's cheaper to own the hardware than try to rent space (even at some bulk discount) with Amazon or Google.
---
Also, considering the last guy that DDoSed Blizzard servers got slapped with an extradition, a year in prison, and a $30k fine, I'd argue Blizzard doesn't take kindly to attacks, either.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
[Oh my god you guys are right](https://i.imgur.com/4Vjc8sn.jpg)
---
They want to sell these types of services. This is how they advertise that.
---
That's a very noob way to look at it
---
I know where that pack of wolves is... took out my Warrior, they did.
---
where are your shoes?
---
Endgame is great for warriors, it's *getting there* that's the problem.
---
I’m saying that I’m surprised Activision doesn’t have a method to prevent something like this.
---
because its just a fucking nobody claiming they did it lmao.
---
Thalnos is down :(
---
Stay strong my friends
---
I don't know how people don't get it! It's not a good joke but.. still!
---
dose Asmongold is actually good at WoW?
---
The punishment should be bigger this time. Lizardsquad got 1 year in jail and a 30k fine.
---
Bc drugs are chill.   This is most definitely not chill.
---
Hit 17 last night at work.  Excited to start tanking.
---
Some kind of threat meter.
---
That's it. Everything else is non-essential in my eyes anyway, and even that could be foregone.
---
No.
---
That's what i was thinking, what mashes thus look the worst is the blue shirt that is completely unnecessary as it offers no stats
---
how the hell do people watch this?
---
To lay traps in combat. It’s a tactic many hunters use in Private Servers.
---
Whats wrong with "make azeroth great again"?
---
Yeah but like... how long will that take?
---
How do you make it to the sub... and not have a sticky show on your feed?  LoL.
---
Pleasant and polite? How delusional. You’re throwing a tantrum on Reddit because you didn’t get what you want.
---
“It’s a troll.”
---
The account doesn’t write its own comments.
---
Almost hit home 😭
---
Ahh thanks for that Patchknight!
---
You're an idiot. The discussion is about whether or not herod specifically has "no alliance players" when obviously the balance is fairly consistent across every pvp realm. Stay on topic please
---
that was when you shot the drill insturctor right?
---
Me too!
---
Retail is also down.
---
what a baby.
---
he literally gets to make money playing this game all the time.
---
the rest of us get to play for a few hours a week except on the weekend.
---
he should be happy to have some time where he can go outside guilt free.
---
cause ddos is different ip addresses sending small packets
---
Don’t go back to bfa. 
---
WC is a pretty long instance, and it’s a long way to run if you wipe. You can do Deadmines, but it’s about as long as WC and you have to make it all the way to Westfall to do it. 
---
RFC is a bit low for you, and SFK you should be lvl 20-22 to tank imo.
---
Haha look Retail bad!! Upvotes to the left
---
Like playing a warrior, you'll probably figure it out eventually.
---
So effectively its getting a bot service to send so many (inputs?) connections at once so the connector crashes?
---
His butthole is gonna get ddos'd for years to come.
---
&gt; I'm not a purist prick
---
You sure as fuck read like one.
---
No need to bring piss to a shitfight.
---
The guys whining and that's what you decide to jump on? Get real.
---
dude.. please
---
Oh the NA servers are still struggling. We're still brothers in server errors.
---
aside from*. Gotta love a Murican who can't spell for shit :) go shoot up a school, that's what the most famous thing your country's ever done
---
Because they're not "down" unless they're offline, and they've only been offline today for like 10 minutes
---
Took a quick nap hoping to get on, I'm still unable to connect.
---
Peepee size has a direct correlation to ego size.
---
And this is a micron peepee move.
---
It’s 1g for your first respec. Unless you fucked your initial talents up you shouldn’t have to have respec so soon
---
Did my first reasonable attempt of WC yesterday. Best group experience I have ever had. We had to quit after 5/7 bosses because we couldn’t find the last 2 and several people had irl stuff to do. But yeah it still took us like 2-3 hours.
---
So true?
---
You made so many people feel so much better. A hero
---
Because some fuck wit thinks it’s funny
---
Rogue leveling in classic going stealth means he's running away!
---
He doesn't realize the DDOS group is laughing at him. At least Sodapoppin ended his stream.
---
How many times you asked a mage for food tho. Just sayin'
---
Still getting dc so not true
---
r/iamverysmart
---
i like to /wave
---
Finally get logged on and getting "a character with that name already exists". It thinks my character is still logged on
---
just add more spells that fit the class fantasy 
---
For instance shaman enchament tank build add a spell that cover the shaman with rocks that give a massive percent increase to his defense for a certain amount of hits before it breaks or with every hit it gets weaker until its gone
---
they exist
---
We all are
---
Yes...until you get booted again...it's a cycle.  Don't start a dungeon, just go fishing or something.
---
Ddos

I've barely played WoW in that past. I somehow bought it twice, as I have two accounts on the battle.net client, but only really recall playing it once. I think this was shortly after Cataclysm. 
---
At the time, oddly enough, I was playing Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 (the 'bad' version of the game), so switching from that to WoW was really bizarre. Everything was easy by comparison and I didn't really feel any challenge from leveling up. I got to around 60 with a friend in a few hours, had no clue what was really going on, and ended up dropping the game. WoW had never really interested me, and this experience 'solidified' that mindset for me as everything just felt too easy and not rewarding. So I went back to FFXIV... lol.
---
WoW Classic, compared to this experience, is a breath of fresh air. The world feels dangerous, every item drop is significant, players are open to chatting and helping out, etc. This feels so much better than the WoW I experienced in Cataclysm. While I still don't think I'll try out BFA, I do have a new respect for WoW, and plan to sink hundreds, if not thousands, of hours into Classic.
---
ya for 2 seconds I bet
---
hmm that is true. i might do that
---
:( 
---
if i knew there were people like u out there i wouldnt be mad
---
any way to find out how much money that dude makes for such a wonderful contribution to humanity?
---
Guess it's time to take a shower...couldn't tell you the last time that was a thought O.o
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=8232 hunter class quest has a comment from 1.12. I was like 13 at the time so I have zero recollection
---
By definition, no because the classic feel means the same feeling one gets to vanilla. Any variation would defy that definition.
---
But lets pretend you mean everything else remains classic feel, and they just change class balance.
---
Yes it is absolutely possible, but the dilemma with any "changes" is that the more liberty you give Blizzard to change stuff, the more risk that is involved with them screwing it up.
---
Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, every spec is still viable to do end-game content. There is just min/max imbalance that will always exist.
---
If he's losing aggro on a single-target like that, it's not because of heal aggro. It's because he's a bad tank. Any warrior, from 1-60, can easily hold aggro on a single-target, regardless of weapon due to sunder.
---
I thought you were talking mostly about AOE aggro.
---
I would move the stick lodged in your ass 2 inches out.
---
It's a joke. Jesus.
---
Dose anyone care?
---
There's a blowjob joke in there somewhere, but I'm too tired so I'll leave it alone.
---
Maybe take an extended break if this really makes you angry.
---
Yeah it seems more fitting for someone like you.
---
So blizz owes you like 20 cents?
---
That's some questionable reasoning, not only because that's not how larceny works, but because eight years in prison for something like this is obscene and serves no purpose. Jail time, sure, but an eight year sentence is so far past where utility ends that it's tragic that anyone could seriously support it.
---
Log into a different character on the same server to fix this.
---
I've honestly never cared or commented on anything like this while lurking classic and pserver subs for a long time, but, yeah.
---
JUST IMAGINE the salt... that instant release spirit... god.
---
Not kidding, loaded in and barrens chat is there
---
This is me, I also teach and coach. I feel your pain!
---
Reroll or transfer to Earthshaker and have fun with us!:) No queues, no insanely hardcore guilds so you might even have a chance on R14!
---
I know that. This early on you shouldn’t have to respec unless you royally fucked yo your talents.
---
Very simple, get a script to send every line of the barrens chat to this guys twitter inbox to show him who he's really messing with.
---
same thing happened to me. Anyone know what to do?
---
I like this sort of response from Blizz.
---
also 1060ti doesnt exist (just saying)
---
i have no actual confirmation but ive always felt it does affect wands too
---
wat
---
That’s a mitigation technique because so many people are trying to log in at once.
---
Good job on your 5Head assessment
---
23, slow grinding
---
I use a plethora of addons but the ones you want probably would be  
---
Bartender4 (to add/remove/move action bars)  
---
KuiNameplates (For mobs nameplates)  
---
Sexy Map (To move the map from top right corner)
---
Shadowed Unit Frames
---
Viet Cong
---
Same. 1 bar away from 40. Have 65g with maybe another 10g in the AH. Just grinding elementals in Badlands...
---
Almost looks like a bald wizard with a beard.
---
I'm a brown brap honker and I say open that 69 port and let the honks out.
---
EU Server down?
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25256-ItemRackClassicQuickfix.html
---
Yes.  Possibly would get commuted sentences for working with the govt or after serving time becoming a consultant
---
We know he's "partly the reason the white rhino is extinct" , so a role model really. Looks like a troll account anyway.
---
Hydration Check
---
what do you mean?? some people like him some dont...some people like football some others dont.
---
I got dropped off of my flight path too! Survived with ~10% HP. My gryphon gave me the boot lol.
---
You need to roll a new toon imo. You are now The Dwarf On The Wall.
---
Same here
---
I was in the middle of a Gnomeregan run, too... :/
---
Warrior quest
---
hurts when my friends are all logged in playing but i keep getting DC every 10 min then being kick out for 20 min on repeat
---
Wtf is going on?? I'm on my way home to play right now!
---
That's an interesting way to look at it. Most of the streamers I follow have 2000 or less viewers at any point so it becomes a lot more like a conversation, but when I come across the big channels maybe this will give a more compassionate perspective... Right before I hide the panel.
---
Ben poop?
---
I kept getting a “A character with that name already exists.” message upon entering world
---
Yeah, no shit, I’ve existed for a while
---
Also Vaseline. Lube that asshole up.
---
Level 32 warrior with 55-60gold here. I grabbed skinning/mining at level 5, plan on being 300/300 cooking and fishing at 35, have done a few levels worth of beast farming (1K needles is amazing I did some quests but p much killed mobs there from 28-32), try to sell leather/ore/white items in trade or AH when you can, vendor p much everything else. I also leveled a warlock to 20 so I could make iron grenades to vendor, used mats I personally mined to level ENG so it didn't cost me nearly anything. 
---
I've also been extremely stingy on my skills, I've only learned maybe 33% of my abilities, no need to buy them all until you need them at 60, and that has saved me a lot of gold
---
Anything can be profitable right now, its more about knowing where you can save the gold.
---
Poor ol' dorf didn't even see it comin'. And now he ded. Poor little fucker.
---
Been in for a while but just got DC'd. Staring at login server queue now.
---
I'm the sexiest one in line ;)
---
I'm pretty sure even at 60 Druid are better tanks for threat. The reason Warriors are better is because they have Shield Block which can prevent crushing blows and Druids have nothing similar to that. Thus warriors are better raid boss tanks for their survivability.
---
I'd like to take partial credit, I reported him 10 times claiming he was releasing my
---
own personal info. even made me sign so i put "Fucking don't give these guys a platform"
---
I didn’t like em before it was cool not to like em!
---
I would like to add that I, as well, am displeased.
---
You're just a condescending prick.
---
Barrens chat. Nuff said
---
Who is "they"? The police? Blizzard? Yes they can do something about it but it's not always such a fast response lol
---
Hahaha that's fucking hilarious and true
---
Imagine going to prison 😳🧼
---
he made those accounts for the purpose of using them to announce ddos attacks. if you think either of them are connected to his personal information you're stupid.
---
Kalimdor is down on Herod
---
Do you wanna be grouped with lame ass humans and gnomes or undead and minotaur?
---
Easy choice really
---
Still cant get in on Herod :(
---
Loss of service can be calculated into monetary losses so depending on how much these companies are losing they may want to go after that person. Supposedly this guy is attacking more than just WoW servers so that might stir up the hornets nest.
---
Do you get honor for that?  Really it’s a pve kill that you facilitate
---
Yup. Nice and boring, just the way I like it.
---
Are people able to play on Herod?
---
I just had a 400 ppl queue on the server, but I'm still getting kicked out of loading screen.
---
It was very confusing for me and my group, we got so amazingly lost but like you we had an extremely fun group that made it very tolerable however cant say id be rushing back to tank it again anytime soon.
---
I'm in awe that Blizzard can't resolve this yet. I say this as someone who worked for a very large international datacenter company that was under attack pretty much all the time in some capacity. So I do understand how this works and what a pain it is to handle. Still...
---
No it's not?? You can handle 2-3 mobs at a time and succubus does good dmg
---
I’m not triggered in the slightest. Being rude isn’t triggering, it’s just rude.
---
Id think they would sell the tech to stop this type of attack afterwards. Bam. Create a problem and then solution. Stonks.
---
"script kiddies"
---
any chance sharing his twitter link ?
---
It would be a better world for everybody yes.
---
Well, that's one way to piss off your healer, and that always ends well.
---
Just had a somewhat similar encounter with a  tank that had apparently decided that mana breaks are optional and  decided to pull at 10% mana. He also decided to get angry at the druid for having the audacity to take 20 seconds to refresh motw. On a side note the hunter thought it was a good idea to need on int cloth, but that's another matter.
---
Tell him you'll charge 1s/heal next time he pulls aggro.
---
The game is important enough that people feel the need to do this.  That says something about the game, in my opinion.
---
Yeah, I don’t get it.  It personally hasn’t affected me much, heck it actually got me out of the house tonight.  I would understand if there some something to gain, anything at all, but just wasting your time ddosing for no reason other than to do it?  Pretty sad that’s how they want to spend their Saturday, but it sounds like they don’t have any friends anyway.
---
Mine is [10.11.0.1](https://10.11.0.1)
---
It's my irl birthday too :( work Monday through Friday all day, not your fault blizzard I know.
---
does this dude really display a MAGA hat on his stream...?
---
Wait.
---
I keep using my feathers running over the water to SM.
---
Could xfer a lvl 1 character....
---
there was pasta?!
---
There's a UI scale slider in there.  Can't look exactly where right now as I can't get in game.
---
this is what i did. figured i did it wrong but it pushed me to this limit when i tried to go around each time and got killed by the guards lol
---
+1 for the guild name
---
roast them on a spit on live tv....
---
Great. My server is the only one down?
---
Honestly, I was just viewing it see what he was doing next IE "I'm going after twitch." or whatever, gave me an idea of when I can start playing again.
---
It’s the ddos shit
---
This type of shit is a game of cat and mouse. As government agencies step up their game so too do the hackers they seek to stop. People/groups get away with this type of shit all the time, and I'm one to believe someone with the means to execute an attack this large is going to have taken steps to avoid detection.
---
STUCK IN LOADING SCREEN
---
I'm in on Grobbulus, happy days.
---
No but you're brining just as much attention to the situation as anyone else.
---
No we created a mass flag campaign to get his account suspended. Twitter has a system that auto-suspends after getting mass flagged. The guy wasn't making pro-trump tweets so twitter doesn't care about looking into the account
---
Got to "19xx" before I had to check the username for /u/ShittyMorph
---
I like to think of it as a circle of schadenfreude. They're doing it now enjoying that they're making people mad while thinking they can avoid the people who are good enough with cybersecurity to get jobs at the fbi or private firms. We then get to enjoy the schadenfreude of him being sentenced to federal prison for a year where I don't know how true it is but pop culture tells me he will be repeatedly raped.
---
Really everyone wins in situations like this. I'm just doing chores I was gonna push to Sunday. I forgot college football season started and my normal grocery store was pretty empty.
---
TBF, I've heard very conflicting claims on that. Seems like its really up the air what it totals out to. Its definitely more that 1% though, I mean think of how good Edgemaster's are - they wouldn't be that good if it was a 1% damage increase.
---
Yes but the cost of items in game do not inflate so getting 1000g for the mount will be a lot easier
---
Shit man they got me. I'm a CIS normie that just can't keep up with their meme culture.
---
I've always loved playing Horde and I've grown to despise Alliance...both have fun areas to quest though, so it's mostly all personal preference
---
This is just part of the experience really. Always happens. Always has always will.
---
You replied to your own post not the comment you meant to.
---
Feeling powerful, they'll never actually achieve anything so paying for a botnet to disrupt others is the closest proxy to it
---
I would assume since you effected them with an ability?  I dunno.
---
That's a nice monitor
---
I literally explained in my comment that their DDoSing of WoW is not listed, as they DDoS just about every major video game publisher.
---
&gt; have been developing and using addons since vanilla  
---
I've got some questions about the development process. I'm a software developer and wouldn't mind messing around in this area.  
---
Is there **official** documentation regarding addons, Blizzard's Lua API, etc?  
---
Is there somewhere that I can see what the development cycle is like? I.E. the loop of modify code &gt; test result &gt; repeat  
---
Are there any fleshed out development environments? I wasn't able to find any VSCode or, and I know this was a stretch, IntelliJ extensions/plugins related to WoW addons.
---
Just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should.
---
If you have a lower level healer, why not use a shield?
---
If you cant generate rage with a shield, why not pick up Unbridled Wrath?
---
You're missing entirely what i'm saying. I'm not saying it's impossible to tank with a 2hander. I'm asking why this is the expectation as being the only answer?
---
How much? I dont see a price on it.
---
Both faction have bad apples...
---
no one asked what you do? this is so humblebraggy and it's so fucking out-of-nowhere. why do you think this reddit thread was a platform for you to bore us with your 'hey guys, good guy here, listen to how I'm so nice to the opposite faction?'
---
no one wanted that ever, just don't post?
---
Engineering and mining is considered the best proffs for pala. There’s a million reasons why but most commonly it’s that grenades give you a ranged pull which makes levelling 1000x easier
---
lmfao
---
I have been getting kicked on Herod on and off for past few hours. 135 queue now
---
Yes that's what I said thank you?
---
Skill.
---
\**cries in shamadin**
---
with fire ants. covered in more fire ants that are also on fire. with razorblade feets.
---
a rogue got angry at me as a shaman rolling one the pants...
---
Whoa now, he's not a famous pedophile /s
---
Bigglesworth
---
This isn't the work of courage, it's the work of what is sometimes referred to as 'slowness', or pure idiocy. The guy worked at McDonalds and now stocks shelves. His mind has devolved to the pointp where he is posting pictures of himself online with instagram cat filters for his friends and family to see.
---
Doth mother know that you weareth her drapes?
---
Like in Pokemon?
---
Yeah i only am doing it again because i knew what to expect.  Its been nice for me because its forcing me to taking my time and im taking breaks by leveling my professiosn and doing some farming. 
---
As a tank ill be needed always so theres no rush
---
I don’t think it’s guts so much as it’s just getting a kick out of making people upset. It’s his lack of balls that led him to do this
---
Nice try Rogue, I know you’re camping my doorstep.
---
no lol
---
sheesh why didn't they just text..?
---
People use reddit on their phones and it’s easier to upload a picture from that app than logging in on a web browser and taking a screenshot, possibly editing it, the posting.
---
The new server login minigame.
---
yes, not sure what to do
---
i can make new char, but loggin into main will DC.
---
I keep on getting stuck 75% thru the loading screen.......
---
Never underestimate an angry nerd
---
To give you an idea, most people will hit level 40 and not have enough money for their mount. I think the total is 90-100g
---
Yup
---
In dungeons/groups if you really need the Mana, try to snipe the last hit with a well timed mind blast.
---
Me!
---
yes!! annyong as hell
---
Yes. They arrested and incarcerated a ddos attacker in the past, a guy in Romania in 2010 I believe.
---
5x Imp Drain Life with Rank 4 onward  is NOT your lowest DPs spell lmao. 
---
There's a reason why all the top warlocks recommend Drain Tanking at around 38+. Maybe get your warlock past level 20 and you'll see for yourself :)
---
SAME EXACT SITUATION.
---
I’d legit just ask till I could hearth back lol.
---
Who the fuck keeps their hearthstone in their first bag?
---
While the servers are down... how do you Druids arrange your action bars? I can’t find a set up that I like.
---
Same boat. First full day of WoW and can't play....ugh
---
Now my load screen is stuck at 75%?!
---
RemindMe! 1 hour "Should I congratulate OP on the sex?"
---
I can get in but it keeps dced
---
I'd rather a world without idiots, but here you are.
---
it must be a inside joke that the rest of the world isnt hip to, only logical explanation
---
No, not directly. Sometimes in the past they would give a day (or days) of free playtime at the end of the billing cycle and push your renewal date out a few days.

DDoS attacks? Hell yeah.   
---
In the US, denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act) with penalties that include years of imprisonment.[\[98\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#cite_note-98) The [Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Crime_and_Intellectual_Property_Section) of the US [Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice) handles cases of (D)DoS.
---
That's what makes me think there's a more serious exploit than conventional DDoS that they have yet to pin down..
---
I used moveanything in retail in order to make my UI look like this. But I'm unable to find anything like it in classic. Anyone have any suggestions?
---
A little north of you and this weather makes me want to play even more
---
I see no difference between what this guy in doing and ganking lows in redridge or boats, this is on a larger scale though.
---
If you're not I to RP I'd strongly suggest a PvP server, but I'd you're dead set on an RPPvP, Grobbulus has the higher numbers admittedly. However if you're looking for RPPvP, meaning actual RP, I'd suggest Deviate Delight. Seems to be a lot less trolling/toxicity/non-rp names
---
That’s for making queues shorter.  Take care
---
What the fuck are you talking about? So buy the stocks, then sell the stocks when they dip? Sounds like a good way to lose money, this shit wouldn't affect the market anyway and if it did they'd have to buy thousands pf stocks to make chump change.
---
No doubt. Had to be a day where everyone wants to play on a weekend, couldn’t be like Wednesday or some shit
---
just to be dcd'ed again in 10 minutes..
---
Infrastructure Engineer here — love my job. I don’t think any day sucks.

Cloudflare helps mitigate DDOS attacks, but as I already said it cannot block it. You need to read up on what DDOS attacks actually are.

Why did I read this in some common dwarf voice?

---
Rattlegore is still getting wrecked.
---
I am happy he's dead.  People like this deserve to die.  With his money he might have got some easy sentance in a facility where he was pampered (compared to actual prisoners).
---
I get that he could have spilled his guts, but nothng would have happened.  Implicate Trump ?- nothing would happen and people would not change their opinon of Trump.  Implicate Clinton? - same thing as Trump.
---
Some victims wanted their day in court and for them I do sympathize.  Besides that I"m glad he's dead.  Saved the taxpayers a bunch of money and he got what he deserved.
---
Mmm
---
How exactly are these attacks politically motivated?
---
hmm, you're right. me too
---
There isn't much outplaying a lowbie can do against a mounted player.
---
I still don't see what is exciting about a lvl?? deciding that you wont quest here for a while. But if that's your thing I shan't judge.
---
You really ought to have been sad about his death. Could have exposed a LOT of corrupt, wealthy individuals if he were alive.
---
Considering it's being DDoSed..
---
SHE GAVE HIM A DOLLAR
---
DDOS attacks aren’t that complicated and there’s little a company can do to mitigate them. So in short, neither.

It's still a very good source of passive gold for little to no effort.  Just macro it in with cheap shot or ambush and profit... literally.  Most I've gotten is like 4 silver in my 50s but you can pickpocket gems and the chests drop them too sometimes.  Also easy way to level up lockpocking passively.
---
neither. DDoS attacks are pretty easy to do, the issue is that more often than not its resource intensive and fairly easy to get caught unless you're Very Very Clever
---
I just pulled it up on my laptop and connected to my phones hotspot. Works pretty well for leveling professions. I wouldn’t try any combat haha.
---
its been suspended
---
My main server (Windseeker) is down so I'm playing on a different server. A lot of servers are up.
---
Projecting yourself too much, eh?
---
I know the feeling
---
Reminds me of seeing a vid where someone was riding a motorcycle for the first time and as they were running into a car slowly they honked and turned on their blinkers.
---
yes...and then no....and then yes etc.
---
because vast majority of ddos attacks arent this advanced. blizz has a lot of protections in place and they stop 99% of attacks. there is no such thing as 100% though.
---
asmongold should get fucked.
---
for the first time in his life
---
Servers are being DDOS'd, not fully down but mass disconnects, restarts, crashes, etc
---
Blizzard services + Wikipedia, apparently.
---
Nah.
---

Everglow Lantern

It’s literally the same 😂
---
14g myself :(
---
OP didn’t disprove the dudes statement... hmmm
---
Most people aren't running aoe comps.  It's popular but nowhere near the only way to run.  For starters, it excludes rogues, hunters, and non healing druids/shamans.  It focuses on mages and locks with priests.
---
Good luck in DM with your aoe and lack of other classes at the same gear level.
---
Also worth noting there's no postmaster derp in classic to save your ass if you don't loot.
---
So 3 days...? (At least for me:)
---
That’s what bothers you?
---
I feel like I'm about to watch an episode of Law and Order lol. Thanks for the info though!
---
Neither. I guess technically you could say this happened because Blizzard is vulnerable, but the reason this doesn't happen is because it's illegal and Activision-Blizzard is far bigger than any "hacker" could be. They'll find him, jail him, and this will all be for a day of internet glory.
---
No I think he got it right. Since DDoS attacks are a brute force, aka mugging. Where as hacking takes more knowledge and finesse, aka pickpocketing.
---
Kid is not a genius, Blizzard is not ridiculously vulnerable. Any server connected to the internet is vulnerable. Even your personal computer is vulnerable.
---
I accidently closed port 69420 am I hacked?
---
rebooted and it appeared :D
---
Is it all servers now or just the big ones?
---
also on rattlegore, i was able to log in for about 10 min at a time over the last few hours, now it just gets stuck at 75% on the loading screen :( feelsbadman
---
No, you're only 8
---
there's a 4chan thread where they tracked down the guy who did this. I'd post the facebook page but doxing rules. Lives in Sheffield UK
---
I believe Apple had hired some notorious jailbreakers in the past to help find the flaws in their iPhone's security system.
---
I healed in Vanilla has a discipline priest. I'd argue a deep discipline build is actually better than a deep holy one (though both will work fine). If you want to level and heal at the same time, discipline is the way to go, with wand spec. Like I said earlier, drop five points into shadow for spirit tap if you're soloing a lot.
---
Best part is the undead's laugh. Sounds like he planned it all along.
---
DDOS attacks aren't especially hard in themselves. The harder part is setting up the botnet to do them.
---
It is legal, I’m considered “exempt”.
---
Let me know if you change your mind. I always have time for a friend in need.
---
He is from the UK. London
---
no no no just some blue scrubs (like modern ones) and a white doctor lab coat jackety thing that i got a nurse scrub store lol it was great I felt so respected and ghirls kept checking me out for no raeson haha
---
That's some commitment to the cause.
---
I can pull up my home desktop at work through Chrome but it's pretty impossible to actually go anywhere or do anything with the character.
---
Blizz pls fix. I suck at Starcraft and Starcraft 2 now.
---
&gt;Just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should.
---
Same thing could be said about tanking sub 60 dungeons in prot spec with a sword and board. 
---
More threat = more DPS = mobs die faster = healer using less mana. Arms tanking is more than using a 2H and spamming sunders. You put sweeping strikes up and whirlwind. Now you have tons of threat on all those mobs.
---
If your DPS has to wait several seconds every pull for you to apply sunders then you'll end up taking more damage. Wearing a shield doesn't drastically decrease the damage you take.
---
Looks like ElvUI
---
Am I adding to the attack by constantly trying and failing to connect?
---
This guy should get the death penalty. Maybe include an exemption in the Geneva Conventions to allow torture for these sort of situations. I want him to suffer.
---
They bias against racism and hate groups, yes.
---
The real adult in the thread here. Have an upvote.
---
yeah ive heard that before which is why I was wondering if that is what it would take to stop them, police literally immediately involved.  comment below linked ddos mitigation which would obviously be quicker, or so I would think.  even though this kinda sucks, need to grind, ddos stuff interests me
---
Because it's not funny?
---
Incorrect. They ban white supremacists. Just because someone votes republican doesn't mean they aren't shit humans.
---
I know nothing about this but this is all just a guess
---
I would *assume* that once the FBI (because it's a felony) finds out who it is, they can order the ISP to shut down his service, then they go get em'. That's what I think happens.
---
insane
---
You got this man! Episodes are shitty, but you know that the bad shit is temporary and will pass, just like this dumb DDOS :)
---
I am in the exactly same situation. 25 lvl, no exp from regular mob. Missed one gem. Want to go back ang finish. :(
---
Pretty sure frost and fire ward can be talented for it too
---
There is a mountain path west of the southern entrance. You can bypass the ?? Guards
---
when u enter world and now it says characters with ur name already exist and now he's unplayable after these random DDos attacks
---
Agreed. I play horde on classic but all my retail characters are alliance because I prefer the aesthetics.
---
This is only true of early dungeons and shitty groups. 
---
REAL groups pull a lot and often, healing specs are 100% needed.
---
When servers are up, I think to myself 'Yes'.
---
When servers are down, I think to myself 'No'.
---
Odds are it gets fixed tonight? I finally convinced some buddies to come over and try it out. Looks like i picked a bad day lol..
---

This should still work. (i would test now, but....) 
---
@showtooltip
---
/cast \[@mouseover,nodead\] whateverspell
---
As for talents, after wand get Spirit Tap, then Meditation. I just got to 40 and don't have a single talent dedicated to healing and I do dungeons just fine. Later on I will respec into something but I'm not sure what just yet.
---
It's funny you should say that, because I did google it. What am I supposed to google? First I googled specifically 8 years jail sentence ddos and nothing showed up. Then I simply googled lizard squad jail sentence. One was sentenced to 3 months, one was given no jail time, despite being guilty of over 50 thousand charges.
---
So no, I'm not too lazy to google it myself; you're simply lying.
---
Of course he will. Hes a master playing the game with how the rules work. Its like if in a race there was a rule you could only pass on the left so he just puts his left side against the wall the whole race and there's nothing they can do about it.
---
Hope these little bitches get super cancer of the anus.
---
Well, that would be one of your problems right there.
---
how hard is that to do though?  seems like the traffic would be pretty blatant and easy to fix.  i mean not easy easy, but easy enough
---
ElvUI lets you as well I do beleive
---
Your peepee may be small, but you have big peepee energy.
---
Ok John Legend. You don’t know shit.
---
He is an alliance human female rogue. I know him. He is my friend. He is on period.
---
An old coworker of mine launched his business by hacking into computer systems and dropping a text file onto the desktop with his contact info.  Didn't bring their systems down, just alerted them to vulnerabilities.
---
The attackers also make progress.
---
He was posting beforehand which services he was going after and surely enough those services went down or at least had attempted attacks on them. If that user was not the one responsible, he was at the very least an accomplice to whoever was.
---
Why do you say that? People have been arrested and jailed for this. The kid is an idiot and he’s certainly gonna get busted... he was dumb enough to brag on Twitter. Moron is done for.
---
That’s what I’m saying!
---
And - you don’t think people canceled subscriptions today? I guarantee they took a hit.
---
 I feel like at the rate we are all trying to reconnect we probably look a lot like ddosing bots
---
My bad. Take off all your armor and res run to the graveyard.

Corner the 17 pound catfish market!
---
I mean... Not only did they say it but there has been a ton of uncovered emails and documents of them doing it... It isn't really even debated anymore...
---
I guess it comes down to whether you think his testimony would be the nail in their coffin.  I'm still hopeful they find a ton of records and stuff that gets others in big trouble.
---
Too far away as in too far for wrath to reach? If so, a macro can’t check distance so there is no way to stay in cat form until in range with wrath.
---
I myself am not addicted, but I just bought a subscription a couple days ago just so I could play classic - now when the login queues are finally being dealt with this happens....its sad.
---
your dwarf is kinda cute

NOOO They got diablo 2 as well....that was my backup. This is pathetic. I cant stand sadists. Finally a day off and I cant enjoy the one thing i want to do right now.

I think the servers are actually up, we’re just unable to connect or maintain connection due to the attack.

If you're still trying to do an escort while servers are under a severe DDOS attack, then you're just an idiot.
---
Even for their citizen? over here in france you the US can't get a rapist so they could forget about a ddoser.
---
Blizzard is pulling out all the stops to make this feel like genuine retail launch 😂
---
This is retarded..we could sit here and list a million things that “should” be a certain way but that doesn’t provide any feedback to what we currently have
---
If you bind your heals to mouseover macros , you can just target whatever and click shoot while still healing without ever changing targets.
---
Which addon?
---
Me too... But my pet wasn't with me so maybe I didn't really movev either
---
well I american so I will go with the american answer...WE NEED MORE GUNS!
---
It'd do it, but not great. For a little extra you can get a 1030 low profile card, which will be closer to current gen hardware.
---
T450s here too! Playing at 720p to keep solid 60fps at low settings. Love it when I can't sit at my desk.

Potentially  up to 400g, but it may be 6+ months before anyone is willing to spend that kind of gold on it.
---
Not even good man, come on, at least try.
---
No, it is selfish. You’re taking more loot for yourself that the group collectively worked towards. 
---
Why should the group keep you when they could get any other dps and be in the same chestless situation, or another rogue who will perform their basic class role?
---
Shitty advertisement if it lands you in prison.
---
You'll be regenerating 5 hp per second, and there's NOTHING anyone can do about it.

Hey guys, im playing wow classic for like a week. I have tried every class + race out, but still cant decide what to main. Maybe you guys can give me some advice or tips:  
---
I like meele classes but dont mind casting, but it shouldnt be a pure caster class.
---
Im very casual, so im playing mostly solo, while watching videos streams. Thats why i like to autoattack most of the time and sometimes throw some spells in.
---
Is there a class which kinda fits those criterias?
---
Cry some more, snowflake. Or are your alt-right hate group online safe spaces being systematically taken away from you?
---
The law doesn't work that fast.  First the police have to identify the person behind the email, assuming he didn't take steps to cover his identity (if it's even the right email to begin with).
---
Assuming it's actually the "hacker's" email, and the police in his country manage to identify it, now they need to get enough evidence to get a warrant and arrest him.  That could take days or weeks.  This isn't something that's going to happen in hours.
---
It burns your hearthstone first if it isn't on cooldown.
---
It seems that you are mistaken, although 6 minutes is a good time a 4 man mage group does that 3 pull run in 2 pulls for an even quicker time.
---
I'm online
---
So youre saying that the supposided DDOS(er) had their credit card stolen? I guess Im lost on your train of thought.
---
I don't get why people keep saying stuff like this.
---
What exactly is he doing to Classic and the community?
---
Keep getting disconnected..
---
I'm on biggles too, are you horde or ally
---
A stupid one no less
---
The rogue is free to leave the group and pursue that then.  I don't think anyone in /4 is going "LF1M DPS, clearing trash for rogues to picket pocket and take chest loot faster."
---
I just wanted to take a break from homework.  No more goddamn chemistry.  Just bubbling and wanting a goddamn Stockade run.  Of all the times the server can be down, it has to be now: the moment I have a slimmer of free time.  Goddamnit all to hell.  I just want to be 60 and with the curve when AQ launches.  I want to be there, I want to have that experience.  But I’m still 26......   UUUUGGGGGHHHHHHH...
---
biggles boys unite.
---
One of the few super wholesome michael moments
---
U got a tiny lil man in ur pants
---
I can verify Rattlegore might be “up” but no playing happening
---
One thing to keep in mind, and I say this because I see a lot of people on Twitter putting blizzard on blast, is that the attackers may be targeting the network provider as opposed to blizzard itself. If blizzards server infrastructure had anti DDoS built into the design, but the attack is farther up the pipeline, there's not a lot they can do personally. Their servers could be running fine but the infrastructure that gets you to said servers could be down.
---
Since we don't have the details let's just be mindful that their hands could be tied in some way or another here. Hoping for a speedy recovery from whatever the situation is.
---

It always worries me when somebody says they are happy about the death of another human being.

Sure, for some people the world is better off with them gone, I just couldn't imagine letting them win to the point of seeing myself happy that they are dead.

Nothing feels better than running into an alliance warrior 6 levels higher than you but they've made the fatal mistake of attacking one mob.

&gt; Today, Saturday, September 7, the World of Warcraft service has been negatively impacted by an **ongoing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack**. For several hours today, we’ve repeatedly seen WoW realms targeted and taken offline by the attacker(s).
---
&gt; It is our top priority to resolve any issues that prevent players from being able to smoothly play World of Warcraft. However, it is the nature of DDoS attacks that players may experience the game becoming unavailable. If you are disconnected or have issues logging in, please be patient and wait a few minutes before trying again.
---
&gt; We will continue to work to address the situation.
---
&gt; Thank you for your patience and understanding.

I think what is important here is the victim in the case. The victim is Activision, so the prosecution would be American.

Hands down for me is "Bartender4".  It gives incredible UI functionality.
---
It's not blizzards fault? Then whose fault is it? Is it your fault? You are paying a multi billion dollar company 15$ every single month and they can't even provide basic ddos protection against supposedly one guy in a basement? Even private servers didn't go down during ddos attacks.

That’s Samwise, the artist behind all the icons and a lot of other Blizz artwork. It was removed after classic.

**DDoS mitigation**
---
DDoS mitigation is a set of techniques or tools for resisting or mitigating the impact of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on networks attached to the Internet by protecting the target and relay networks. DDoS attacks are a constant threat to businesses and organizations by threatening service performance or to shut down a website entirely, even for a short time.The first things to do in DDoS mitigation is to identify normal conditions for network traffic by defining "traffic patterns", which is necessary for threat detection and alerting. DDoS mitigation also requires identifying incoming traffic to separate human traffic from human-like bots and hijacked web browsers. The process is done by comparing signatures and examining different attributes of the traffic, including IP addresses, cookie variations, HTTP headers, and JavaScript footprints.
---
I'm at level 37 and my blizzard is only doing 50 damage, why yours is doing 70?
---
You would have to watch him for more than 5 minutes to realize that his on stream attitude is exaggerated because he knows it gets him more LULs and clips like in OP posted on reddit, which in turn generates him more exposure and revenue. That's what the twitch has come down to. Twitch Chat just loves to see people being mad and they love to create drama from nothing, so the streamers feed this behaviour.
---
I think it's *only* on big channels. I have a really pleasant experience on most channels up to 1000, the majority of which are just lurkers.
---
Regardless if you played retail or not.  You're paying blizzard money for access to retail.  Along with that, for free, you get access to classic.
---
Sure, you can argue that you're only given them money in order to be able to play classic, but you literally can't buy access to classic by itself.
---
Dont be teasing me
---
I can almost guarantee its somone in china. There has been lots of anti china posts in the last 2 days. In any game I have ever played, when the anti china posts go on reddit there is a huge ddos soon after.
---
Horde confirmed as best
---
I am able to get into other servers, but if i try to connect with Mankrik it disconnects afte 5-8 secs.
---
Exactly, this isn't tough with enough money for a big enough bot net. The advertisement is to 15 year old script kiddies to do it for the luls...
---
"Heartbreaking"? I mean it's annoying sure, but I wouldn't go that far. The servers appear fine now, just pick up where you left off.
---
Second this. I have the i7 variant of the t450s with a 256gb ssd. Cost me 339$ on eBay. Runs classic at 60fps on 720p low settings with ease and great battery life.
---
It’s not just that though. Has little to do with the game aspect. It has to do with the denial of service aspect of services. Game or not...... it’s a crime to breach/overload someone’s network for malicious intent. Causing monetary damages for big name companies. DDOS attacks are considered “cyber terrorism”
---

---
If 3 million people have an active sub, this hack is costing the users roughly 750 thousand US dollars on wasted subscription time every 12 hours .. so it's safe to assume this costed Blizzard customers roughly 400k about now (in sub costs) 50cents each a day
---
40 isnt lvl 60 thouh. thats still 20 lvls away.
---
While I’m mildly annoyed because I just downloaded classic last night, man as a teenager who did stupid shit this would be hilarious to pull off.

Thanks for letting me know lol

Did I mention Native Americans? Did I say Americans were the good guys? Nope. Bad rebuttal, tbh. What I did say was that the trolls, who are native, have sided with the Undead and Orcs, who have been aggressors, committed countless war crimes, destroyed the land, etc. How many millions of innocent people have to die by the hands of your allies before it is your fault for not breaking away from them?

I think you need to really think about how you like to play.  All classes have weak points.  So the question is how do you like to play?  Alone mostly?  Look at a hunter or lock.  Like to do more damage or be support (heals or tank).  Do you like to swing a hammer or sword or cast spells?  
---
I guess in the end my best advise is, if your not going to play alts, then pick something that matches your preferred play style
---
Lol the honestly is heart warming.
---
Did distract get removed in retail? Used to happen all the time in Vanilla and TBC and now I cant remember the last time I've had it happen to me.
---
#nochanges unlike 99.9% of p servers that had minor changes &gt;.&lt;
---
Attention whore
---
What addons are you useing for ur action bars
---
They took down Wikipedia too.
---
On Herod.
---
Can't get past loading screen on my existing characters.
---
New Undead alt can get into the game.
---
New Orc alt cannot.
---
No, I'm saying that it's not hard to DDOS.  I used a fictional example to explain that it's easy to do.
---
You're either trolling, or you really don't understand how this works.
---
Is GW2 still going?
---
So many great features and designs that just fell flat after a week of playing.
---
ToP tIeR
---
Good luck finding any
---
I understand that "getting to 60" is what he does. But why does he delete it ?
---
As of right now it's just rerolling.
---
BUT HOW DID YOU DO IT????
---
In here from /all/-- did they really DDoS Wikipedia over WoW?????
---
I have no problem getting ganked, it's part of the game. i'm just saying it's the same kind of person that does it.
---
Why delete tho ?
---
But all the time spent to that character is not worth deleting just for a name change though. But that's my only option?
---
Yeah, same!
---
Like many of you, me and a friend of mine set aside today as a day for gaming. So disappointing
---
Imagine getting triggered by a red hat
---
They get more attention the other way. You can't inform people of things without drawing attention to it to some degree. That is just how it works.so posts like yours are dumb.
---
Thats insane. On alliance we run deadmines in like 30 to 45 mins. Easy.
---
Thanks for suggesting a solution! Tried but my alt couldn't log either though. Thx anyway.
---
Yeah I'm trolling
---
Ally
---
Been on Grobbulus for about an hour with no issues, in case anyone is on there.
---
have you dragged new ranks to your bar?
---
A locked chest in a group dungeon is different from a mining node, and everyone who isn't a rogue can understand that.  Now who is suffering from cognitive dissonance?
---
That's not what that said lol
---
Yeah at most. You won't see any in-game benefits.
---
Elvui is the shit.
---
Titanbar!
---
You must have at least 15 years of gaming experience to know this. I'm not gatekeeoing, it's just how it is nowadays
---
I'm so lucky the only person to steal a piece of spirit/int cloth from me so far was a warrior
---
Why say lot word when few word do trick?
---
No. If you are paying $15 a month and you are only playing classic.... You're paying for classic. You can parrot back whatever marketing bullshit you want but you're still paying for the game you play
---
"Socially inept" coming from the guy with a severe lacking understanding of acceptable social interaction and behavior."
---
And well, sure... dickish to take the mob when 5 people are waiting.
---
But also super dickish to kick a person who has been waiting just as long as you have in order to try and invite a person you just mentioned you weren't going to invite.
---
By your own logic you should only invite people/classes of people that are good at snatching up mobs as they spawn and leave others, because otherwise it's a detriment to your own success.
---
All I can say is.
---
UKDriller going to get that booty hole drilled in a U.S Prison lmao
---
Well yes, only assholes play alliance.
---
bigglesworth offline again...
---
haven't been able to get in for an hour anyway
---
im level 10
---
Bigglesworth is down, I repeat, Bigglesworth is down 😔
---
If a warrior can charge first and has the sweet PvP trinket, they can dunk a mage pretty quickly later.
---
Ewww... just hit Ctrl + up arrow.
---
Same here.
---
Same here. Starts loading but stalls 3/4 of the way and then says the world is down
---
LMAOOO, I’m YELLING
---
It's the opposite for me. I could never really get into Horde in retail, now I'm primarily Horde on Classic.
---
Been playing on bigglesworth for about 30 minutes now, just got kicked out and showing offline. Was a instant kick out instead of the usual lag until i exit game
---
The realm selection screen now says the server is offline.
---
my neighbor and i am on biggles and he is on but i cant gt on
---
You always want a slow weapon so that you han weave in your spills without losing dmg. 
---
A slower weapon uses less ammo which saves time.
---
Makes it so you don't have to stop and shoot as often when kiting. 
---
Does way more dmg when you crit since the damage is high to begin with.
---
Multi shot does more dmg as it's a auto shot + some more dmg depending on the rank. 
---
You also want a slow melee weapon in pvp so you can do more dmg with as few hits as possible.
---
The only people who can confirm these stupid "worlds firsts" are Blizzard, quit trying to attention whore
---
Yep. Lets me get to character select, but won’t load the world.
---
Is highly suggest the five subject college rule notebook. You can get them with three holes so it fits great in a binder.
---
Im not sure if this is me or not.  My toons name is Tazdingo but I have no recollection of this happening.  regardless the coincidence is hilarious.
---
BLIZZARD. RESET BIGGLESWORTH SERVER. WE ARE ALL STUCK ON LOADING SCREEN.
---
Benediction best server, even if you are filthy horde scum

Is the guy actually from the US or any first world country?
---
Funny thing is that the graphics haven't even changed!
---
Marketing bullshit?  You mean the objective truth of the purchase?
---
Pretty sure the bill doesn't say WoW Classic on it.
---
Which server are ya on?
---
Ddos protection is actually incredibly difficult, you essentially just need a major amount of bandwidth upstream to handle it
---
/spit
---
Well, materials have a need button for a reason. What would be a valid reason to need a gem besides that?
---
account is currently suspended.. good job twitter
---
I’m a tad behind you in the low 40s and seems heavy horde
---
Also bear in mind that if you go heavy disc you'll have a bigger mana pool and do overall less healing, meaning you won't have to downrank as much. If you go heavy Holy, you'll likely find yourself downranking to be smart.
---
Also, try this tool: https://www.wowdownrank.com
---
You're a very precisious man, congratulations.
---
Even if you created a new character today you wouldn't be so far behind that you'd miss AQ. Blizzard probably isn't going to start phase II for months. The people hitting 60 and clearing MC and Onyxia right now are a tiny minority compared to the rest of the playerbase. Most people are in the 20s-40s.
---
Look at it this way: If you created a new character now, you'd be less than two weeks behind everyone else. That's not a whole lot of time in the grand scheme of things. Early on it's huge because each level is a big stride, but come endgame all it means is you missed out on farming UBRS/LBRS/Strat/Scholo/BRD for two weeks.
---
Good to hear. I'm an employment law attorney so I nearly spit my coffee out when I read your first comment. Here's to hoping the servers come up soon!
---
&gt; on a larger scale
---
Amen. For the longest time dungeons have been treated as if they are races and are meant to be ran as quickly as possible...I grow bored of dungeons quickly due to this in retail. The mega dungeons that Blizz recently released is nice and all but that doesnt excuse the fact that 90% of the other dungeons are incredibly linear and not very interesting.
---
This is just Vietnam war footage.
---
It's offline. D:
---
Bigglesworth is Pacific, it seems horde heavy in my experience (im alliance). que time on the weekends night about 45 min.
---
Pretty sure if he was forced to work in an Amazon warehouse for a few months he'd willingly climb into the form for the new warehouse and begging you to pour the concrete faster.
---
Someone is DDoSing all classic wow servers.
---
Same.
---
Ddos probably
---
Cool tank item for Viscidious
---
One can hope
---
Okay I won't corpse camp them ;)
---
No. They already don’t let you do this on retail. They won’t restore the character as long as you have the name saved.
---
Exactly. Sorry for not being more clear, I thought this was well-known.
---
I get paid a salary, it is the same whether I work 40 hours or 80.

What's funny is that this is basically the same point Agent Smith made in The Matrix.

They changed it so it caps to four, but people used to level by sitting and stacking reckoning procs to four. Will reckoning still be the best leveling spec without this?
---
Yeah, hard to find in IT typically.
---
Posted from mobile quickly to see if anyone else having the issue. Congrats on being a dick.
---
My 2011 Mac book pro says otherwise.
---
Plz bring back bigglesworth only have 1 day to play this game a week and herebit is ):
---
I'm in a post, mom get the phone camera!
---
Did you just open up reddit and click new post before taking even five seconds to read front page of subreddit?
---
not sure if serious... I don't think I know a guy who doesn't game lol.
---
I mean, I still can't get into Herod either.
---
can we get a RIP
---
And having a friend save the name for you or doing it on a second account won't work either?
---
It's up.
---
just popped back up but still hangs at world server and drops.
---
burn
---
Bigglesworth is the only one down  😠
---
I think you are right about that. I haven't made any other than a /tar so far in classic. I tried to do remember but its been a ....spell :)
---
Bro I was pumped to play Gears. Their servers are fucking buggy as hell. No problem, I thought, I'll play WoW
---
What a great weekend
---
Herod is just Kalimdor.
---
If you've got characters in the Eastern Kingdoms you can log onto them
---
Well when the fuck is it going to be fixed
---
He said "virtual" look up that word you bunch of pedantic fucks.
---
Same. Made me realize how much I was looking forward to playing tonight. Does that mean I am addicted?!? LOL. First time playing WoW.
---
Try it and find out :)
---
Sorry I misread the posts above, I thought you were talking about BRE not Sulfuras.
---
This is just a brute Force attack, they are scumbags
---
Hopefully they have better tech to handle this now. I remember back during MoP servers were DDOS'd multiple times a week for 3 or 4 months. Sucked so much that 1 or 2 assholes can just kill the fun for everyone.
---
Yea Rattlegore is super busted up still can't load in on any characters
---
Grats! I’m still in my level 40s so I’m sooooo fucking behind, but I’ll get there too &gt;:(
---
Get a Surface Pro, i'm using one thats 3 years old but it still runs wow fine.
---
&gt; proper opsec
---
there are like 5 people world wide who do opsec properly
---
Yup. Same here. I made a new toon on Benediction but then realized that I don’t want to be starting an alt rn at all.
---
Yeah he's level 10
---
Don't do that
---
Don't give me hope
---
Don't give my comment gold, the user /u/DeadlandsMarshal was the one who posted this to my similar question. I just wanted to share his knowledge :)
---
I just made the same mistake in Hilsbrad.
---
I got DC'd on the way back from my hearth on the zeppelin.
---
Orcs are optimal, but Trolls aren't terrible in comparison, right? Especially considering that Troll v Orc is a matchup you only get in friendly PVP and not cross-faction pvp.
---
Lmao you’re wild.
---
I mean, it's probably making them a shit ton of money
---
This is ridiculous

Its ok, i made an alt rouge, was going to do it eventually, might as well start on downtime. Gl out there.

I'm going to guess you pull closer to 80 hours more often than 40.
---
No changes
---
I'm Horde, but still have fond memories of my first character in Elwynn Forest.

Lol, "didn't make a dime" I made 12g the other day being in UC for an hour. You don't advertise free, you just run up to people and give it away.

/cast [nomod] Arcane shit

/cast [mod:shift] Serpent sting
---
/cast [mod:ctrl] Hunter's mark
---
/cast [mod:alt] Wong clip.

That macro will give you 3 binding on one key, just hit the modifier for the spell you want.
---
For example put the macro on button 1
---
Push 1 it cast arcane shot, press shift+1 cast serpent sting. And so on
---
We've got tons of people sitting on undead, but making new chars or logging into mains on Kalimdor is impossible.
---
I hope this comment is a joke
---
Us rattlebois in despair
---
At least you can get in!
---
Haha! I just got my son into the game, he has never played WoW before so he is super bummed we can't get on, since I made him wait till the weekend when I had time. Hopefully we get a chance to play this weekend, but I'm not feeling optimistic.
---
True, doctors are insured.
---
It's a macro that replaces your Hunter's Mark spell altogether on your hotbar.
---
Any report on Heartseeker? I’m at work right now.
---
Considering that EK has been fine for over an hour, it's probably them not noticing.

Me n u. Alone in discord. Who knows what could happen.

Always jump during a blink. It will then ignore the level of the ground.

Been at WC since 8 this morning. I haven’t been able to leave lol.
---
 Well, what exactly do you think that this person can "graduate" to?  The longer these attacks last, the easier it will be for law enforcement to catch them.  I disagree that it's inconsequential to give the attackers what they want.  We can't control others' actions, it's only logical that giving someone the reaction that they want is going to perpetuate the behavior they used to get that reaction in the first place.  This isn't rocket science -- We all know that attention is what they're seeking.
---
And yes, I'd agree that people are perfectly within their right to call it out.  That's not what I'm contesting here.  What you're saying would make a lot of sense if this person were just attacking an individual, but the victim in question is a billion-dollar corporation.  That's the key thing I think you're not seeing.  I can promise you that Activision-Blizzard is far more interested in protecting their assets than any of us ever could be, even collectively.  They literally pay system security specialists and data analysts huge salaries 
---
Blizzard has more access to information on these attacks than any of us do, and the attacker actually went out of his way to Tweet directly at Blizzard.  Trust me, they don't need our help.  At any rate, the "awareness" you're talking about might mean well, but it's effectively just spam because the only thing it does is serve to feed the ego of the attacker and give Blizzard and the authorities more stuff to worry about.
---
Why? If you go into a store and physically bar entry, you can be arrested for that. You can't just disrupt service with no consequences. Stop defending the shitstains of society.
---
Yea this has been a real pain to deal with not getting past any load screens

got a link?

I agree fellow human
---
Jumping on the fuck hunters bandwagon, I had a hunter win corpsemaker against my enhance shaman. Right along the corpsemaker, the agi pole arm dropped. I was fuming. His guildies even defended it... such shame.
---
Trading Places is a great movie.
---
I don't understand this. If you group, you cover more area, you save run time and you end up doing more than double the damage against mobs that you would by yourself, which makes the half xp worth it
---
It's a good thing for him then that law enforcement can't catch you unless you post a confession online with three copies of notarized ID.
---
I think you can only undelete a character once every 15 days, unfortunately.
---
On rattlegore as well and cannot get in.
---
Yeah considering a DDOS is happening I would say your data is useless. Gj.
---
How did you assign keys to your abilities on the right hand side of your screen?
---
It’s easy for me. Orcs wil always be the enemy in any fantasy setting.
---
Threatening the revenue flow of the world's largest video game publisher. I bet AB will send over $200k on legal fees just to get the maximum possible sentence to scare off other potential hackers
---
Awww that's really heartwarming to hear it's kind of funny how most of the og's who played this game have kids now and our trying to show them the magic of what was up hopefully this gets fixed soon
---
Pretty sweet lookin, hope it turns out good.
---
you are mad
---
The Alliance and Horde must unite to defeat the DDos!
---
be sure to check out the other reply to my post. I made an error so don't put faith in that macro.
---
&gt;to feel even the most meager feeling of mattering 
---
most of the blackhat circles do it as a _resume item_ of sorts. Taking down a high profile company or video game makes you look good.
---
No...I don't think I will.
---
It does, I of course tested the macro before posting here!
---
 Everyone who does this is for the extra media attention. If you say no, you have no vision on things.
---
No, it was just on.
---
is it effecting or affecting
---
This really rattles me bones
---
Seriously, I was about to finish a quest line, get to the inn and log off to go to a wedding. Instead, I'm now stuck in the middle of a field. Fuck em, hit em with the book!
---
Could probably toss some kind of obstruction case on it from having them devote resources and time into verifying the claims.
---
They look pretty generic to me.
---
Don't get so worked up
---
You're in the minority
---
Again, we took away world first defeat from Method.
---
An absolute travesty, too. As that's where *I* play!
---
Alright, this joke went over your heads. In a DDoS attack, the attacker is most likely using a bot-net to be able to take down such a large company. This would stop the bots obviously.
---
I start off pretty care bear and run live and let live until I let a few bad apples ruin me. Then I kill a hunter while he's taming a rare and then I kill his rare simply because he chose the faction that I learned to despise. 
---
I think the rule of thumb is Rogues, Hunters, and Forsaken will always try and dick you over when you're in a tough situation and should be killed on sight or stalked until they're in combat to give them a taste of their own medicine. 
---
Locks and Wars tend to be more aggressive, and will usually attack you on sight so it's often safe to say they're live and let live if you pass each other with no sign of conflict. Keep your guard up if you see one coming towards you. 
---
Druids and healing classes have a tendency to be more docile and can generally be left alone. 
---
Keep track of both guild names and player names on your server. If you see a trend such as 'there's a lot of ganksters from &lt;We met on eHarmony&gt;' then it's probably a safe bet to kill any players from that guild specifically and camp their corpses, kill that rare they were trying to tame, and mind controlling them into inconvenient places such as deep water. 
---
Make a shit list and check it twice. You may notice someone has it out for you for something you, guildie, or some random bag of feminine cleansing product may have done. Take extra care to make sure your nemesis learns to fear and dislike your name with the passion of Christ. And make sure their friends learn to steer clear of you.      
---
Make an opposing faction friend list and check that twice. Remember the name of the Warlock who intervened on your behalf when you were half way to the grave and have 3 mobs on you or the player that keeps paying premium on your auctions in Booty Bay. If you see them out in the wild give generous concessions to them such as help completing a quest  or even a chest or a node out in the world. You should also ask your friends and guildies to treat them with respect. Good behavior should always be encouraged after all. 
---
RP walking and waving are good ways to show non-hostility in most situations. Have you noticed how rare it is to find a Cop alone? They use the buddy system because they could be in a dangerous situation at any time and should always have backup. You should too. Don't get caught out alone because most situations where pvp happens is when one side has a visible advantage.
---
That's why you throw a shuriken at them when they fall.
---
Can you send that in a PM, and a link to people discussing the other info?
---
catching =/= charging
---
As someone stuck at work all day on the weekends, my heart goes out to you all. I've always been bummed about missing playing a few days a week but this is sad to see.
---
at least the OT is nice and working a lot makes it hard to spend it lol
---
"An eye for an eye" has been a cautionary tale for millennia of human history. Isn't it about time that you paid heed?
---
What's the point of the ddos attack.
---
For fun? For publicity? Ruin people's day?
---
For some people who have limited free time and limited hobbies, having someone complete negate your ability to utilize that time to do that thing definitely warrants some heartbreak.

I would still think it counts because they're attacking a US based company.

Lmao, apparently the solution to ignorance is...

More ignorance.

Does the group not get to roll on items dropped from chests?

---
Don't defend multi billion dollar company. They were attacked on couple us realms only and those realms were completely down for hours, some of them might still be. And people here are angry on some random guy on Twitter (who probably didn't do anything) instead of company which is not providing the service it is paid for.

Thanks aren't necessary to make a good deed a good deed. Be happy and proud of yourself for being a good priest. :)

Virtual terrorists? Bit much right?
---
If you look at it as you were helping a fellow alliance by driving them off, I'd say it's justifiable. /1 asked for help, and you did, nice work looking out for your faction.
---
Also, it's the nature of pvp servers, we all signed up to be ganked and spawn camped by joining a pvp server.
---
You are dumb and your parents were dumb for having you. Did I do this right?
---
Yeah one ruined weekend really isn't enough for me to justify 8 years of their lives gone to prison and extreme hardship afterwards with that on their record. Good thing nobody actually served 8 years and that's just bullshit. I'd be a little concerned with out justice system if that was the case
---
Shild dispel dispel psychic scream SW:P mind flay to keep them in range, Mind blast, mind flay, After that it's a question of whether you're willing to try casting another mind flay or wand twice (you don't want to be counterspelled or shield bashed or kicked) before casting another mind blast. If that gets kicked, desperate prayer and hopefully your scream should be coming back soon enough. Keep youself topped up. They stopped your shadow spells, not holy.

Cognitive dissonance: " the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change. " 
---
You are the one that can't seem to accept an attitude change.  And have said the other guy suffers from it even as you argue over and over, like a broken record, that a mining node is different from a chest and ignoring all the arguments related to that.  I think you are the one that doesn't understand what the phrase means and think it is just a trump card you can throw at people to win a debate.
---
Try to break down the nuance of the distinction between lockpicking as a class utility (to which all rogues have access) versus professions that everyone chooses two of (including all rogues).  The inability to thread that needle is cognitive dissonance.  Further, blacksmiths and engineers are different from rogues opening a chest, because it is a profession and not a class utility, and additionally costs materials.  There, I explained it.   You can disagree that that differences doesn't change the nature of who gets the loot that's fine because it is a value judgement, which is subjective.  But they are objectively different.  So you can't just invalidate other's subjective judgement by denying the objective difference and calling them out for cognitive dissonance.
---
You can spare me the sarcasm about playing other classes, from your obsessive fixation with this issue and the rogue icon your biases are pretty clear.  For someone throwing around psychological terms like cognitive dissonance you should try reading up on bias.
---

Hide and seek is so much fun! Do you have a party with the people you are playing with or do you stay partyless?

Your point is valid, but there's nuance to be had. There's a difference between expecting everyone who drives a car to know how to rebuild a transmission, and expecting them to know how to toggle their headlights/wipers.

I doubt they would even be able to detect that unless a lot of reports were made which wouldnt happen since they'll never notice the difference. It's not like its hard to do manually i just dont have a high sens.

To elaborate, you tame a pet with the higher rank (presumably stabling your original pet) then make it attack things with the ability you want until it says you've learned it. You can then teach it to any pet that can use it.

Only thing I miss is the guild bank. I'd love a guild bank for classic, but I know that's a change and cannot be added in. It'd just be nice to have somewhere to dump all my excess mats, but I can always AH them I guess!
---
Found the computer-illiterate zoomer.
---
Bigglesworth online for about 10 mins now, seems stable
---
This is how they were back in the day as well man. Seems when they brought back classic WoW, they brought back classic customer service as well.
---
Was getting "world server down" on Rattlegore- now just getting disconnected.
---
IS RATTLEGORE BACK ONLINE PLEASE SAMA?
---
Has it been happening for 3 days?
---
My alliance is on that server. I randomly decided to roll horde elsewhere this morning. Glad I did.
---
I feel due to the fact that the majority of folk spend 70-80% of their time on one faction and roll/level on another faction only a little bit. I for one mostly focus on alliance, and I can assure you, 9/10 times I get killed it's due to getting ganked by higher levels for no apparent reason..... Although I was in the arathil highlands and I had a great experience of killing defias bastards next to an undead mage and not once was there any intention to screw our leveling up.
---
Even after by accident I tagged and shot him by furiously trying to get the last NPC on the map. I emoted sorry and backed up and we got each other.
---
Same as when I rolled through Ashenvale and started a campfire and fished next to another tauren hunter on the bankshore. Overall pleasant experiences except getting ganked by higher level bastards 😂
---
Blizzard IT got called into work on a Saturday. They’re probably pissed because some kid found out how to DDOS over the summer
---
Fucking idiot
---
You have a 24% chance to miss while dual wielding. You need to hit things to build rage. The only dual wield tanks are fully geared farming AQ with a highly specific talent build and a hardcore raid guild. None of the hardcore guilds are using dual wield tanks, currently. They run deep prot with a shield.
---
can't get past 80% load screen
---
It goes to the rogue. Rogue decides what he wants to do with it. Some are nice and will give it to you or let you buy items cheap, but it's the rogue's.
---
cant get in yet
---
Big yikes spending money to hit off a 15 year old game and not even able to actually take more than two servers offline for 5 minutes.
---
Most criminals really are that stupid. It may sound trite, but if you were smart you would use your capacities to profit yourself in a way that doesn’t end up with you behind bars.
---
Like post malone says, "Never seen her face vbut she got beautiful boobies:
---
People on twitter were posting the alleged culprits info.  This assumes the person making the claim is actually who they say they are and also assumes the info posted about said person is correct.
---
Its not just classic wow tho
---
Are you in Kalimdor? One of my friends can only connect to his characters that are located in Eastern Kingdoms, but not his Kalimdor toon.
---
More edge.
---
Seems like some layers have a working Kalimdor.  Log into an UD or EK alliance alt and find someome with a working Kalimdor layer.  They can invite you and switch your layer.   Then you can get back to Kalimdor.
---
Although he is extremely confident, he clearly missed the entire lore surrounding the Troll Wars/Trollbane and how the alliance between the humans and elves was working to make the entire race of trolls extinct prior to the Horde arriving, even killing them as they ran away.
---
But hey, at least the Alliance are the good guys.
---

&gt; It's not like its hard to do manually
---
\&gt; can't do it.
---
Everyone on a pvp server is someone else's monster, as a horde keep killing us, nothing feels better then when 8 of us group up to down you and then have a dance party. You increased those players experience.
---
The turd is actually an ally. A dead one...
---
Hey look it's me in a reddit post -Miardu
---
Try any character not in Kalimdor
---
&gt;Imagine going to prison because you ddosed ~~Wikipedia a 15 year old game~~ a bald gnome.
---
I think there is less ganking. But zero RPing. I think RP pvp basically means that there might be pvp but in a more “honorary” way
---
dude I see me
---
&gt;I'm still hopeful they find a ton of records and stuff that gets others in big trouble.

MDI on twitch had the best twitch chat ever lol 😂!
---
Do you have any actual experience with someone like this?  Sure, they'll eat up any kind of attention they can get, but the attention they're seeking, specifically, is anger and pleas.  They're after a position of power, not one of indifference and disregard.
---
8/8 was great mate.
---
Not only are they just dicks, think about the money they actually just cost some big companies. Their attacks on Twitch in particular are going to end up screwing them big time I think. Unlike WoW, they lose money every second people aren’t watching. What idiots.
---
And now they can continue knowing it gets attention
---
“Go with honor, friend”
---
Probably those mongoloids who tried to stroll through WC and got raped hahahaha

4 buttons one macro

I can't log into my main? I can log into any character on retail fine. I can log into my level 7 alt on classic fine. I just cannot log into my main character on classic without getting dc'd. I've tried several times and I've tried updating bnet and restarting but I'm not sure what else to do. Any ideas? What's going on?
---
If you don't stop and look around once in awhile
---
Can horde get this item?
---
Go to the spot and if you see other hunters camping him, I wouldn't try contesting if I were you. Instead i would try being nice to them to convince them to give you the timer when they get him. Stay on that layer (don't accept any invites from people). And exactly 8 hours after someone got him he will respawn. Just grind in the area nearby while you wait. IDK how load screens effect layering so I wouldn't risk it but it might be fine
---
My fiance has been wedding planning, but I can't wait till she can play with me again :)
---
What a wild extrapolation. Stop typing, you're just embarrassing yourself.
---
yep same, can connect to EK but not Kali.
---
VIRTUAL TERRORISTS
---
MUST BE ELIMINATED
---
May their blades never dull
---
To take down Wiki and Blizzard Servers :DDD You think they spend that much money for that only.
---
I'm not that its THAT far cause Halo 3 and CoD4 and GoW3 were all for gameplay, they had skins but like, not this insane new craze
---
Thanks Blizz! Not all hero's wear capes!
---
Yay they're starting to come back up!
---
Draka has too
---
lol their twitter was taken down
---
So much excitement, so much more disappointment. Still can't get past loading screen on my end!
---
To be fair, although he does this on purpose, the Restore Character button will ensure that his toon will always exist (however in 30 days from the moment this happened the name "Jokerd" will become available on that realm for anyone to take)
---
Not for me yet :/
---
Still lagging and dropping in game
---
And the alliance symbol is a pussy.. (cat)
---
Thanks for showing the alliance's place in the world.
---
Are you on Herod? Some servers have one continent down and not another.
---
Same :(
---
Okay, I expect this is gonna get buried, but they're not doing it for exposure.
---
It's a service. The service they offer is taking down a site. They're building a resume, allowing them to say "Look, our botnet can take down Wikipedia and Blizzard, so clearly we can take down your target".
---
They do not give a shit about internet kudos.
---
50/50 chance you'll get banned
---
PvP is fun dude, even without the honor system
---
Ignoring the fact that *most* people are still playing, what exactly is this post for? Weird flex tbh.
---
I’m stuck at 90%
