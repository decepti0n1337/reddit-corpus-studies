Wait, so he sold his account to someone, then stole it back off them? They paid for it and then lost it?
---
---
---
Oh.  
---

---
Is that current retail? Sorry I don't play retail.  
---
If you PvP you won't have to look far. Few classes can have as dramatic an impact as a well played healer. Triaging to keep the most important targets up, dispelling crucial buffs from opponents and debuffs from team mates. Your positioning matters, and being prepared with consumables and engineering gear gives you a lot of tools to maneuver effectively.
---
You're a force multiplier, either for your playing partner or other high impact DPS on your team. It works both ways too; you'll have access to a "pocket peeler" who can help clear opposition from you when you are focused.
---
&gt; One possible factor is that I'm considering forming a guild for the most maligned hybrids - so either a druid/pali or druid/shamy guild.
---
What the fuck is the point of that?
---
Server pop is a much trickier question than just deciding on a number. You have to expect less than 30% of people will still be playing in a year compared to the first month. With that in mind you need to think about caps for launch week, 3 months, 6 months 12 months, 2 years etc.
---
If you're farming, and using Manual Crowd Pummeler on the regular, you are a true masochist. 
---
It makes far more sense to support the games you like and avoid the ones you don't. To that end, supporting and enjoying classic is not you giving ActiBlizz your tacit support and approval for other titles, or even Retail despite the shared subscription.
---
Opting out of a game you know and love, that is well designed with lasting appeal because you don't like the producers' other titles seems absurd to me. Just don't buy/support the other titles.
---
&gt; Although I'm curious how far we might get.
---
You won't get anywhere, because you underestimate how much of a pain in the ass roster management, and loot competition is in Vanilla.
---
If you've killed it all before it isn't progression raiding though. 
---
Lol, I can't imagine a NE druid noticing there's no trainer once he's in Elwynn!
---
Why didn't you just Google what 7.3.5 is rather than arguing with peope because you thought it was an ancient client (it's from circa 2017 iirc) 
---
Appreciate the answers! Thanks alot and have a great day! 
---
&gt; What class is considered best farming character? Is it Hunter?
---
Once ZG comes out mage will be the undisputed champion of gold farming. 
---
My first character was a Human Paladin that lasted all the way to 60, and a few dungeon runs. Then I started trying other classes and realized, yea I really don't like playing a Paladin.
---
Right now on retail gold is generated if none buys the token.
---
Oh did I say it was an ancient client? I don't remember saying that. Let me check hold on.  
---
Definitely faster than Everquest, both the combat and recovery. Probably faster overall than Final Fantasy 11. About even with Star Wars Galaxies from what I remember. But I personally found MMOs like Dark Age of Camelot and Asheron's Call faster paced combat wise than WoW.
---
Unless I am mistaken from playing private servers, there is a low limit to the amount of debuffs a boss can have. If you ARE min maxing like that I'm not really sure you'd want to waste a spot on another deep wounds? I've had normal guilds get mad about it. It isn't an issue if the guild is laid back and taking the bosses down np, but from a min max point of view.... I dunno. 
---
os did
---
No
---
1. I'm not sure why they would "fix" this per se. Doing so properly would probably require adding a few new quest hubs, rather than slightly increasing XP gains/reducing XP needed per level. Grinding was part of the leveling experience back in vanilla, though, for better or for worse I expect it to be that way in classic.
---
2. Class balance is a hugely unpopular topic that consistently weights heavily toward "no changes" in all the polls and surveys (which granted are not official or restricted to would-be classic players or vanilla-era accounts). Further, tweaking class balance without breaking encounters, making hybrids insanely OP (remember the utility they bring), simply making other classes or specs obsolete, etc would require extensive testing and tweaking throughout the life of classic and Blizz has made it clear they don't want to run a 2nd MMO alongside retail.
---
You've always got the option to body guard and split profits, or help and group up.  It's not always you vs them.
---
That's sad :/ 
---
When the limiting factor is open-world mob respawns, it is, in fact, me vs them.
---
Yup, people love pretending Vanilla was like Nam. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My favourite posts are the ones when people say how hard Vanilla levelling was and then follow up by telling us their favourite anecdote of being an 8 year old and getting to level 50 without knowing about talent points. 
---
Sorry. You said that you thought 7.3.5 was an "older" client.
---
You can literally Google WoW 7.3.5 and find patch notes from just over a year ago. That's not "old" by anyone's standards. 
---
Before you could queue for BGs in cities Horde players would go to Wetlands while waiting in the AB-queue, making it close to impossible to level in for Alliance players. 
---
They just sort by row or corner etc.
---
I mean you will do less damage, but in a casual guild if you make up for it by perhaps going a bit harder on consumables you should be fine. 
---
plain strider for the chicken and beef combo
---
Replaced with the first green drop in TBC :P
---
My bad ill take that one, 10mil going by there numbers ...... i just guessed from memory ill take that one for not checking information. however fact still remains for only so few players out of so many to achieve what they did, it wasn't a walk in the park nor do i think it will be this time round.
---
The story of pepitoz and the little blurb at the end to undo the mage sheep nerf always gets me. 
---
God damn do I want to play some TBC while throwing back a few red bulls and watching Venture Bros. on the other screen. That’s some OG shit. 
---
Have your warrior go crafting and your hunter go farming. That way you can farm mobs, skin and look for mining nodes all at the same time. Then your warrior can be a Blacksmith / Engineer for all the good mining stuff but not need to farm it or buy it himself.
---
It's possible.
---
Wolf/Coyote. There's a quest that sends Tauren players to gather ingredients for a vision quest in which you follow and commune with a wolf spirit.
---
Wind Serpent as well. The game hints at their connection to Tauren lore and mythology.
---
Im gonna remap my UI to an elvui lite thing first thing I do upon login. 
---
I’ve always hated default UI and throughout the entirety of my WoW playtime I’ve never used it. Classic will not be the exception. 
---
It's not valuable info if it's false.  I asked my private server guild, we are a few weeks away from Naxx - if they thought 20 minute strat runs in fresh 60 gear was realistic, nobody thought it was.
---
Plus he's since gone back and changed his strat = 60g an hour, to "if you're the tank and you reserve everything", yeah that's really viable for most people lol
---
There are a few I hope to see, most of which were (or could have been) actual addons during Vanilla. Top o' the list is one that lets me toggle mouse look, for obvious reasons, followed by a dynamic camera mod (automatically zoom in/out depending on where I am and whether I'm on foot, mounted or flying). Next up will be bag and auto-sell junk mods for inventory control, then a slew of RP mods because I'm a giant nerd. I'll wrap it all up with one that takes a screenshot every time my character levels so I can document the journey one ding at a time.
---
The only one I'm aware of that wasn't a Vanilla addon is one called [Immersion] (https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/immersion), which I discovered during my brief stint playing BfA. I don't know if it'll be possible with the Classic API, but I certainly hope so. It's a nifty little toy for the, well, immersive sorts like myself.
---
Ahhhh Priston Tale! Didn't think anyone else outside Korea ever played that game. It was so good! I went from Ragnarok Online to PT to Rose Online to WoW. It's no wonder I love a good grind.
---
Sounds like a personality issue tbh.
---
&gt;Go play dress up there.
---
I don't agree that new hairstyles etc necessarily should be added to classic, but really? "go play dress up?" I'd bet money you'd be at the front of the pack reeing if Blizz updated the character models and you "couldn't make a character you like anymore :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( "
---
Back in 2005 I was working the evening shift to pay for college so I had to raid at odd hours. My first real raiding guild was mostly Chinese guys. It may surprise you to know that they were all *super fricken rich*. One of them had to quit WoW because he inherited a hotel from his Grandpa or something. So yeah there's that.
---
‘How low can I let their health get before healing’
---
Spam heals on a focus target during Nef's Priest call. Maximum enjoyment. 
---
I was pulling out 1k g plus a day solofarming strat live as a mage
---
shame on you for being combat and not popping that sweet sweet berserking when you had the chance.
---
I'm devoting a permanent pet slot to an owl. I'm going to run my horde ass to Teldrassil to tame a strigid owl. Screech is pretty great and owls are all around a good pet for leveling.
---
they'll also be bought by me. You're welcome to camp them yourselves to save on the convenience upcharge.
---
Yes. Let's have 2 hour login queues, days of server downtime, and no widescreen support.
---
You're an ignorant fool for saying this because you don't understand that *Classic WoW is meant to recreate patch 1.12 with content stages, not any other patch.*
---
There were RP-PvP servers during patch 1.12, and before.
---
No one cares about XP off rare mobs in vanilla. It’s not different than a normal mob. You are thinking MoP or Cata+ where rares was like completing a quest. 
---
Same, haha
---
Enjoy your quiet week off?
---
TL;DR: Alliance Warlock and Priest, NA region, normal server, not looking to start raiding ASAP but does want to raid, want a group to play/socialize with.
---
Hi! I (Warlock) played WoW since a few months after launch. I never reached max in Vanilla, but I did raid a lot of TBC up to Illidan. Very casual WoW playing since. 
---
The Priest started playing in MoP and casually raided, but wants to get into raiding in Vanilla. Planning on healing at 60.
---
We are looking to get into Classic with some new friends as none of ours want to play. It can be a guild, a small group, or if you are a single player looking to join us in making our own group. We put emphases of the sociability of a potential group/guild as opposed to unwelcoming required min/maxing. 
---
Looking forward to hearing from anyone who reaches out who feels as though their potential guild/group is suited for us. Please contact me by PM here on Reddit. 
---
Id be ok with it since it wouldnt introduce more gold into the econ and actually help keep some bot gold out.
---
Interesting. At what rate?
---
&gt; But those pieces require exaulted so if you're going to use them you will want to be ranking because thats the only way you'll get exaulted.
---
Rep doesn't decay but PvP rank does. You can get exalted with WSG playing an hour per day. If you play an hour per day you're going to top out at rank 8 or 9 and stay there. That's not even enough to get any parts of the epic set.
---
That's a fat fuck no from me
---
Yes. A thousand times this. I have been in many a wsg, ab, and av where I have felt like the mvp as a priest. Getting that flag carrier across the battle field. Saving that tank during the end of av. Guarding a flag in ab all alone and keeping myself alive long enough (and beyond) for reinforcements. There is a deep and profound feeling of being unstoppable when it is you who gives longevity and life to others. Without them you are hard to kill, but with their protection you will live forever and it will be your life’s work to keep them alive as well. It’s a beautiful thing. Your opponents will hate you and try as they may they will not be able to kill you because not only will you have the tools to stay alive, but some of the most badass bodyguards who are incredibly thankful for your service. It’s a rush to be so squishy and yet so unbeatable. 
---
Haha this was a joke. But I will be taking a week off as soon as the release date is announced
---
One might even be tempted to call it a [Dead Man's Party] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhN8SdulOFc).
---
Main tanking in classic (and TBC) was one of my favorite things ever, so I'm jumping in here even though I'm 7 hours late. 
---
Quick background for my perspective: I was an off tank who took over as MT in what would I would have called a third level guild (Horde) at first (not competing for world first, or even ranked kills, but killed everything up to Twin Emps before major nerfs), rerolled to Alliance after C'Thun had been killed and was a DPS warrior and off tank for some top 10 world kills in Naxx and went MT so the progression MT could do DPS later in farm status and kept MT into TBC.
---
A lot of this stuff is just good info and I have no private server experience to affect that. I've seen people pushing the idea that defense skill doesn't matter, and this is a much more correct take. You're probably not going to defense cap going into MC and Onyxia and that's fine. I'd definitely want to be able to defense cap by the time I'm starting BWL (if memory serves putting on the Onyxia scale cloak meant I had to make one or two gear changes to sub-optimal stuff to defense cap and probably tanked the drakes at 430-435 defense a few times). You might have a wipe or two in progressing through MC if you get bad luck with crits, but you just can't cap defense effortlessly until you're in BWL gear. That said, once you can cap effortlessly, you always cap. (good point with paying attention to stats rather than just BIS list is that you'd sometimes change gear based on the fight mechanics).
---
I more or less agree on race choices. Threat was under-rated and poorly understood for a lot of Vanilla, but being a human in TBC was a huge benefit for me. I'm not sure how good berserking is but it's probably pretty reasonable. Personally, if I end up going horde I'll play a Tauren because I like them and 5% HP is good too, but I could buy that going Troll is better. Axe skill on Orcs would be great but I don't remember using many axes for tanking and I wouldn't want to go after weapons that aren't as good just to use my racial skill (that said I'm mostly just remembering The Hungering Cold).
---
Rage to start a fight is huge: yup. But also for most fights that's just a speed thing. Waiting 5 seconds to start DPS accomplishes the same thing.
---
Consumables is also something that's stood out to me in recent discussions. I know people go fucking nuts on private servers, but almost no one did that in Vanilla other than a few fights (personally I did it for Nef and Loatheb and I think that's it, we used flasks and potions more often but never as all out as I've seen on some private server raids). Use what you need to use. I'm sure some people will have the gold locked down and be able to use everything all the time, but I don't think that will be reliable for everyone, and it's 100% not necessary.
---
Fury/Prot is the one thing I can't really speak to. I never ran that and it wasn't popular as far as I know in Vanilla, but that doesn't mean it can't work. I'm not sure I buy that it's better though. A little extra rage generation and flurry (plus Death Wish) vs 1 hand weapon spec and shield slam? IDK. I do 100% agree that once stuff is on farm you're not gearing and worrying about full mitigation. Naxx wasn't really out long enough on vanilla to get everyone to the point gear wise that I was ever threat limited anyway (maybe 1 or 2 people going all out could get close on a threat meter). I 100% put on DPS gear in BWL and below though.
---
I'd go on but this isn't an organized post and I can't really think of anything else to say that doesn't just sound like me reminiscing or trying to brag about playing a game 15 years ago, but I love chatting on tanking so I'd love to discuss anything else too.
---
The games not even out yet, no.. no guilds have started yet.
---
Deep wounds are allowed and they are low priority when it comes to pushing away other debuffs. In any case, note that tank threat can often be the limiting factor in terms of raid DPS.
---
My first character was and still is my main.  It was warrior.  I've always liked the up close melee style characters, and guess I got lucky that I liked warrior playstyle.
---
Screw #nochanges; if this guy doesn't attack with the bread, the game needs to be updated so he does.
---
&gt;An easy way to alleviate that is to discuss loot drops within your class group. In 40 man raids, groups tend to form between casters, healers, etc. This affords the opportunity to pass gear to other players who genuinely enjoy that role/class, which builds up trust and appreciation from other players in the guild.  
---
  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The trick then becomes getting the next class/role to accept you into their group - usually easily done by accepting "hand-me-down" gear that is passed over by other guildmates who have played that role longer, before challenging them for a really good peice of gear.
---
Correct. Tokens if anything would prevent bot gold from getting into the econ and would remove large sums through the ah fee.
---
God this is hilariously wrong the more I read it the more confused I get. Do you literally think tanking in Vanilla is just press Shield Block, then press Revenge? Over and over and over again? 
---
Except they are? My buddy has been bugging me to get my name on a list for his new raiding guild in their discord. I'm not going that ham on Classic, so I'm not really interested in trying to find a guild months before release, but he wants server first Rag so, to each their own.
---
And now my brain has seized upon and run away with the idea of playing Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler as a Forsaken.
---
This may be the greatest idea in the history of third-hand ideas.
---
I would personally do the same. He specifically mentioned that fury/prot is only suited for hardcore guilds and advised new tanks to go full mitigation and experienced tanks to go for impale right away. He explained in detail how well your healers and dps have to play and prepare for fury prot to be optimal or even playable.
---
There are no guilds on classic.  It’s not even out, how could the possible be a guild on something that doesn’t exist?
---
His advice for new players was to take the deep prot build though. 
---
That takes me back to dual leveling with a warrior who had 4-8 mobs on them and a full bar of rage, cleaving mobs down as I threw heals, we would go 2 hours without leaving combat (only to return to town to free up bags) as I wanted the runners and procced Spirit Tap. Of course this was with pserver dynamic respawns but I love the idea of a 2h warrior taking massive damage to get a full rage bar and getting topped off on heals. I'll try it from the warrior side this time
---
I'm more talking about interest threads. I know it's not out, but that doesn't mean interest for these things can't be started. 
---
what kind of dead/10:1 server was that?
---
\#2 with 170k honor is a laughable low amount, like a daily dose of honor on some servers
---
Release date is Aug 26, 2019 
---
Not sure what people are complaining about s I thought this was great, and very useful. He’s reporting on the DW fury but it’s not like he seems to think it’s something a lot of people should do a lot of the time, but it’s niche and hardcore and lategame. Said himself he did everything in deep prot the first time, and new tanks should do the same, and I agree with that.
---
I think he’s fundamentally right about his talent changes (wish he didn’t leave tips hanging in finishing off the prot build with defiance/one handed spec etc), anger management is huge, and even if you don’t take that you should have 2-4 points in tactical mastery for stance dancing (charge, berserker rage, intercept, etc)
---
Tips is basically the worst part of this video
---
Barlog
---
Wow, that was on my home server.
---
Mage. Search up Vurtne Mage PvP.
---
There's a discord server for both guilds recruiting and players looking for guilds. There's some guilds recruiting but I think they're mostly hardcore/semi-hardcore.
---
discord.gg/HNT7UPq is the invite link
---
Should be Warlock. Dots and multiple CC's. Mage might be second.
---
Digital vintage.
---
How could people possibly get guilds together before the game comes out? It's almost like it's possible to communicate and organize outside the of the game, hmm...

---
"Coming summer 2004" oh my sweet summer child.. 
---
Those are good questions. The main factor here is sitting crits which will not happen in classic so this will need to be tested when it comes out. But in terms of raid DPS, threat generation and even survivability I have no doubt that this will work. Will it still be optimal? We don't know yet, but my bet is a yes. Note that these guys don't barely make it through content, they absolutely wreck everything in the shortest times.
---
Different mitigation values etc. will have an impact but for the absolute min-maxers it will be: Will we down this in 1 or 1.5 minutes? I doubt  that the value differences will be drastic enough for these builds to be pushed out completely, but you may have to use your shield more, move around some of the talents or not go quite as ham on Death Wish in some situations. Note that the Warrior talent tree is very forgiving: The mitigation talents are all easily reachable.
---
But again, that is not the main takeaway. If you watch the video he repeatedly said how as a good tank, you should make your own decisions in terms of both gearing and putting points into your talent tree. He said the same about consumables. I think this very empowering for anyone who wants to tank.
---
But the /r/wow sub seems to something like at least half of the active English-speaking subscriber population.

Thanks so much. Really appreciate it.

Can't tell if serious or...

Did anybody else lol at the barlog? Pretty funny misspelling of balrog
---
No comments in a year, it’s legit boys

Yea when I feel ranty I don't use punctuation 
---
Not completely vanilla, but my experience was this:
---
I played horde only from vanilla until early cata, quit and came back for WoD, but wanted a new experience (just wanted to level, quit after 2 months into the X-pack). 
---
  So I rolled a Dwarf and it was like playing a new game. Many zones you dont get to experience as one faction, or you get a completely different experience. I took my sweet time and it really was like experiencing the leveling up for the first time all over again. 
---
  If nothing binds you to a faction i encourage you to roll the other side once classic comes. Don't look up shit (unless you dont know where to go next) and enjoy the ride.
---
I'm from Melbourne and will be looking at playing Undead mage on a PvP server at release :) Daily hours sounds good for me, everything else you've mentioned sounds good too (realising I'm not warlock or warrior) but let me know if you're interested :)
---
I don't see what Elite Tauren Chieftain's positioning has to do with this.
---
I can agree on the /sit crits but outside of that you are making major assumptions. We will have to see.
---
In terms of druid tanking: He didn't claim that they are optimal for main tanking. I specifically warned about that in my post as well. They are optimal off-tanks and resistance main tanks but for the majority of bosses you want a warrior. What he said is that they *can* do it and he has done it himself as well.
---
Also, those with the best progression. Most pserver levellers and fresh 60s I know are looking forward to classic (most are only playing to hype for classic), but nobody that has their hands on T3 will gear a word about it. They think playing a blizz game is preposterous and “only idiots fall for the F R E S H launch meme”
---
Sure, because it takes a real genius to grind to T3 on server that has completed progression and is slowly dying, and make their plan to stay there for years longer.
---
Did they show up in the Grim Guzzler in Vanilla? I can't remember. 
---
I miss Reborn UI and Decursive's one-button-cure-everything-automatically. I also like Jar Jar Binks and drink Dr. Pepper. Sue me.
---
It's worth pointing out the RPvP metrics were kinda' hamstrung right out the gate by virtue of not being a thing until 1.8, by which point all the RP nerds had already been playing on and establishing themselves among the existing RP servers for nearly a year. Sure, quite a few of them made the jump once the option became available, but I'd wager at least as many decided it wasn't worth dumping all the investment they'd put into their characters/server communities up to that point.
---
Personally, it was always my intention to roll on an RPvP server from the moment I learned Classic was going to be a thing, so I never bothered making a big deal about it. I think most did as I had and just quietly assumed that would be an option, which, IMO, is why Ion saying they weren't planning to include it caused such an uproar.
---
I also hope Blizz listens to feedback and reverses course on this one. I actually hope we get *two* RPvP realms per region so folks can play both factions without choosing a different realm type. Not expecting it, mind, but it would be nice.
---
In either case, I genuinely believe the folks at Blizzard will be surprised by how popular RPvP is when it's an option up-front and folks don't have to choose between the type of server they wanted in the first place and the characters and connections they've made while playing somewhere else.
---
That voice is nails on a chalk board, holy crap.

---
I don't know him outside of the interview. In there, he came off as the complete opposite of what you are saying. Maybe he changed? Maybe he acted nicely in the interview? For all I know you are some random butthurt average performing tank who got critisized by a very good player? Or maybe he *is* a complete ass? Tbh in terms of this discussion I don't care either way as this interview was very informative.
---
I learned that way too, but have learned of the specifics as I progressed through school.
---
While I see Sept as a “fall month”, I still focus on specifics of date when it’s relevant to the context.  (Such as this)
---
Bear is an underrated leveling pet in my opinion. It's very tanky, and since it has both claw (for focus dump) and bite, its dps is fairly decent as well. Much higher than say, a boar who is similarly tanky and has advantage of the charge, but quite lower dps due to lacking the claw ability. 
---
In short my plan is to do dungeons and casual raids with healer gear, and then farm and PVP with ele gear, both with the 30/0/21 spec. Assuming I’m good(fingers crossed), can I keep my groups alive with this spec? How gear dependent are shamans for PVP? If I get pre-Raid BiS and maybe a couple of epcis will I be ok for PVP?
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
I think the site is an excellent initiative and should be stickied imo.
---
What server was this? The name seems really familiar for some reason.
---
Well in TBC everyone used ravager pets since it was OP, there was less viable pet variety in TBC than vanilla imo
---
[removed]

Thanks for doing this.
---
&gt;However original vanilla wow was only capped by hardware limitations.
---
Untrue
---
Note: This is 100% speculation. In fact it is speculation based on speculation. So please do not take this as the truth.
---
26 human warrior, then my wifes cousin made me get my own account. Mained a survival hunter till wrath with an alt prot warrior. 
---
It doesn't inject gold into wow. A person spends money on a token and then a player buys the token with gold. Gold is transferred but not created.
---
He himself and others have said in this thread that the fury/prot build will need further testing come classic because you cannot use sitting to procc Enrage, so it will be less viable than on pservers. We'll see I guess.
---
The best players need to test things out anyways and experiment to find the optimal approach for each phase/encounter. As you did for example by wearing different sets of gear for different tiers.
---
No, they implemented /startattack to simpify scripting macros. Up until that point, there was a lot of bad info regarding macros, and where you had to place what command, in which order, etc...  
---
In classic, macros worked, but you had to have the right one. The issue for the 1.12 re-release, is that to my knowledge, Blizzard hasn't yet identified whether or not they will use current scripting or the original model used for classic - until we know that, we won't know what to plan for.
---
July 16th confirmed.
---
Just curious, will this run retail too? I’m gonna resub just for Classic but haven’t played since mid legion. I heard that lowest settings are still tough for most low end computers these days.

Hey I have a question.  
---
If I was born 3/10/2019 and you were born 3/12/2019, am I older than you?  
---
same, my first guild ever was found when trying to do that quest about a week or two into launch, it was really cool at the time.
---
Not because I couldn't make a character I like any more, but because it's a non-vanilla change.  
---
Why is that so hard to understand?  
---
Same here. If you aren't trying to be cutting edge, it's nice to take a break from characters from time to time while leveling your main. A side effect might be that you change mains multiple times(like me)
---
The standard world buff combo is DM/ZG/SW Head/Songflower. I don’t know why so many people think it requires warlocks and crazy planning, it doesn’t. Not even for AQ.
---
Set hearth to Cenarion Hold.
---
Get your DM buffs literally any time before raid (could be two days before if you want). Port to SW, fly to Westfall, swim to ZG isle and logout.
---
At raid time, sit on disc and wait for the call to log in.
---
Log in all at once, get ZG buff.
---
Port as a raid to SW, stay in mage tower and get head buff.
---
Port to Darn. Fly to Felwood. Find a flower, click all at once.
---
Hearth to CH, ride to instance and start clearing.
---
Should stuff have 1 hr 40 min left on DM buffs, which is enough time to get C’Thun down.
---
For MC/BWL, it’s even easier than this.
---
You use Supermacro and scripts in Vanilla, it's amazingly clunky and I'm personally so happy we're getting the 7.3.5 API (which means non of the following will matter for Classic)
---
Mouseover macro:
---
\&gt;/script if UnitExists("mouseover") then TargetUnit("mouseover"); CastSpellByName("Serpent Sting"); TargetUnit("playertarget") else CastSpellByName("Serpent Sting") end
---
Activate something like auto attack without cancelling it (requires auto shot to be on action button 14):
---
\&gt;/run if not IsCurrentAction(14) then UseAction(14) end;
---
I ended up making one for my Rogue that used Stealth if not stealthed, Ambush if stealthed, and used Sinister Strike if I was in combat - this is for levelling of course where you can't Backstab, else it'd be backstab regardless, or Hemo if i was high enough level:
---
\&gt;/run if not IsCurrentAction(13) then UseAction(13) end;
---
\&gt;/run if IsCurrentAction(13) then CastSpellByName("Backstab") end;
---
\&gt;/script if UnitAffectingCombat("player")then CastSpellByName("Sinister Strike") end;
---
Any class + Goblin Rocket Helmet!
---
You'll be level 10 in a couple of hours.
---
I don't remember them even being in vanilla. 
---
They just had 8.15 They will milk subs ob that patch for 2 months as that is their current strategy  
---
They've announced 8.2 so they will follow that up with 8.2 and a second month to milk 8.2
---
Then - and only then - (and that means August)  - can we talk about a realistic release date for classic. It is not their product for the main audience (sadly) it is their 'filler' system (hence why we will pay the sub for a general WoW account instead of splitting the subs between classic and retail)  
---
Plaguebats in EPL. All the greys and whites they drop have good drop chances and sell for (relatively) a lot. Your basic consistent income is getting stacks of eyes and pelts etc that sell for 1-2g each pretty quickly. Most bats will drop more than 1 of these items.
---
It’s not the most efficient of all, but it’s an honest farm that a warrior can do at any time, no professions, (skimming helps but not necessary at all), friends, guild, alt, aoe or cc needed. It’s one of the few grinds warriors actually have an advantage in over some other classes, because the normal plaguebats have a fear ability that you can easily break. 
---
Totally foolproof and there’s so many around the zone. Decent chance of pretty good BoE world drops adds a lot of random bonus gold. As far as just farming nonelites goes it’s pretty decent, which I think is what a lot of overwhelmed scrubs are looking for.
---
healing really cuts into my wanding and overall dps... 
---
They were certainly a ***thing*** during Vanilla but whether they were in the game or not I don't know. Oh! Probably not because there was a blood elf in the group. 
---
Anyone planning a twink should make it and make a b-line here and camp their twink to be.  It will be the best time to do it since pre-bgs less people will be thinking about twinking and you might get your trinket faster than you would expect.
---
There was a leak some months back where pretty much everything from the leak was confirmed to be true durning blizzcon except the release date, which said may/june 2019.
---
Just a few more ticks of that precious mp5
---
I always used gorilla for the aoe - is screech better threat?
---
I would argue that profession based farming is the way to go for all classes before DM comes out. Meaning you'll be skinning devilsaurs, checking veines/herbs, trying to get good recipees to sell stuff on the AH and generally smart usage of the AH. Also if you have a good group/guild you can simply do dungeon content with them.
---
These solo vendor farm runs are fun and lucrative, but they are not the end all be all in terms of money making. The richest vanilla players are buying/selling stuff on the AH  combined with gathering/crafting.
---
How many hours did you farm in that day tho?
---
When I was playing classic my irl friend and I had this idea. Our guild was called Druid mafia we had about 20-30 druids before bc came out 
---
Paladin. Doesn't matter how many enemies are hitting you - can't stop a bubble hearth!
---
Death Flayer - fastest AS Scorpid. Good tank, good damage, good threat. Poison has some great uses, I turn it off vs melee in pvp. 
---
Great metaphor
---
&gt; You will likely get caught by a crocodile a few times in Wet Lands. Or shot by an orc on your way up the moutain road to Dun'Morough.
---
Its faster to swim up the coast and drown yourself. google "vanilla wetlands skip"
---
I just MT’d warrior with a bear offtank tonight and can confirm it’s a very sweet combo
---
Their extra hp makes them very useful against magic and aoe, they can keep threat on trash and bosses like they owe the bear money..
---
Depends on your professions though. Point of a mage is you can kill anything in masses, if you can use the drops to craft something valuable you can increase your margin by alot.
---
its not that your wrong imo, its more that the point is kinda being missed. The assumption is that you likely arent going to be playing the character for long stretches of time anyway, so the rested will likely accumulate naturally anyway, with or with out an inn. so in the long run its faster, despite being inefficient at low levels.
---
The guys kick is bound to alt -. You may want to reconsider. 
---
I think an interesting mechanic would be a seasonal server that you know when you roll on that server it will reset after X months. can't keep the Character etc.
---
not that I would roll there but some people would. 
---
Head buff didn’t proc in retail in tower and you couldn’t multi click felwood buffs.
---
Also it’s terrible design to run an instance or get a buff days in advance and not “be able” to play your character.
---
You really think that a handful of people in one guild will know every bit of this massive game? Either way, it doesn't really matter what your raid prog on a private server is now, it doesn't validate your opinion at all.  
---
I read every comment in this chain btw. That was one of multiple examples he gave. He never edited his comments, you can go back and look now if you want. You're just arguing about semantics. 60g per hour as a fresh 60 is 100% possible in multiple ways and on multiple classes.  
---
when people talk about efficiency bears are sadly not on the list as pet families are divided by +% attack, +% HP, +% armor and special abilities  
---
With the hunter having to heal for quite a substantial amount of mana you want your pet to either
---
have high armor modifiers  (making your heals more efficient as less HP is lost over the duration of a fight)
---
more dmg modifiers (because a shorter fight means less dmg to heal)
---
or special abilities to make your life easier in general
---
bears have only one of the above, and they are not the best when it comes to armor, they are primarily a high HP pet family  
---
SL lock, hands down strongest 1v1 class, no contest. 1v3 probably still warlock, but now mage, warrior, druid and rogue also join the mix with their variety of cc, burst, mobility, and survivability
---
What sort of faction ratio did you have? the imbalance must be tipped so much in the alliance's favor for you to be able to consistently farm horde city bosses, especially orgrimmar...
---
It may also be this very faction imbalance that causes your faction to have incredibly high queue times for bgs and thus leading to less honor gained, that's the only logical answer for what i'm seeing lol.
---
Yup
---
Try using a foam roller on the front of your thighs, most knee pain is a result of overly tight quadricep muscles. 
---

---
"The more you know!"*insert rainbow*
---
Back when Blizzard was innovative 
---
Looking at this list is very reassuring because there are so many good farming/grinding spots in terms of both gold and xp that are left out in this list.
---
My approach to this, which is quite obviously the best, is to research grinding spots in advance with the database, the AH, personal tests and tune it to the server maturity, my profession, class/spec etc.
---
/s?
---
Warlock is pretty strong. Succubus seduce, fear, Soul Fire, shadow bolts can eat away a lot of your health before you get a chance to fight. Most other classes with that amount of control tend to come with a downside - healing from cc's like polymorph or long cooldowns on things like blind.
---
A well played warlock will win most best of 3s when you play them back to back.
---
What others have said, but also it depends on guild and progression. More chill guild and it’s just a farm run for stuff you, the MT, don’t really need? Just let the GM know and they’ll have the OT and whatever other spare OTs (there will always be a few, at the very least some fury warriors with a tank set) can handle it. 
---
If you do this too often, do it at a bad time, or go for an extended break? you might find yourself being edged out of the top spot. If you’re cool with just being one of the OTs, though, you can be a bit more laid back.
---
Confirmed? If so. Fuck yeah

**Introduction:** If you’re looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you’re a PvE raider who’s looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you’re at the right place.Everyone earns their roles here, whether they’re Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
**What we expect of members:**
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids (once a week).
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot.

So.. no mention of how to do it via skinning the wendigos? And in fact, this guide isn't for dwarves at all, but for night elves? And arcane shot is called Magic Shot in this? 
---
Dang dude you're all over the place here
---
I could 1v2 pretty effectively on my near BiS elemental shaman. Burst down one, then 1v1 the other. 
---
I would basically "one shot" the first guy with lightning bolt + chain lightning + shock -- 2k crit, 2.5k crit, 1.2k crit = gg. 
---
I'd usually save my natures swiftness for the 2nd guy as an ace in my pocket. 
---
If I had engi on that toon I'm sure I could've gone 1v3 easily ... I've 1v3 successfully without engi though, usually just getting nice crits and going up against clothies or rogues with low hp pools.
---
you forget something here. The access to classic wow runs over the retail subscription. This means people are subject to the EULA of the retail version. Many of the addons and scripts that are allowed (or ignored) on those P servers are not going to be good for the longevity of an account.
---
This also applies to decursive and healbot scripts. That alone will screw a couple of people over
---
My very first in 2004 made it to 3 I think.  Finished the first few quests and then I had to quit because my dad's ancient desktop from like 1998 would crash the game while going up Aldrassil or doing anything beyond just killing the first quest mobs.  Probably ran out of memory I assume (It had 128mb according to google, a Gateway G-350).  
---
He got a new one in 2005 and I didn't want to play that character again because I was scared it would break.  Got my second character, human warlock named Xerzes to level 34 I think before I deleted him because my gear had more intellect than stamina or something and I read an article online saying warlocks needed only stamina.  Then I just had lots of alts that never got past the 30s. Yes,  I was a dumb 13 year old.
---
People just raid log anyway... hence the perpetual fresh hype. The game is stale once you’re BWL/AQ geared and waiting for Naxx.
---
It’ll be interesting to see how world buffs end up planning out.
---
Which means all the popular/streamer names will be taken by people instantly. 
---
When you go into Maraudon you usually also want to clean up the earth elemental patrols in there. The little ones have a chance to drop elemental earth - and while this isn't that useful at release you can just store it away because those turn into pure gold when AQ40 opens
---
The dungeon also has some mithril clusters (aka gold truesilver mithril spawns) and blindweed/stranglekelp herb spawns
---
Hey! I’m on dragonmaw!
---
Don't be silly. A guild doesn't have to be "on" anything. It's a community of people with the same interest.
---
I've recently tested it and came up with something. 
---
I believe you'll get about a 70k xp per hour and a 50-60 aswell.
---
Note that you'll need to get Shadowforge Key just like you're getting Mara scepter to do this kind of stuff. 
---
Shouldn't be a problem though, there's a ton of groups that doing BRD quests but not going through Lyceum if they're not 60 yet.

If you've got any questions, feel free to ask~
---
Nice one dude! Interested for sure, how rigid are you on the class choice? I definitely dont blame you of you want to stick with mage, I have a 60 UD mage atm and it is the good life. I'm still a little flex able but I know I want to heal or tank end game content. 
---
Mage + Mage is a legitimate option with AoE grinding, it's a bit of a hit without dm o launch though. 
---
I'll PM you my discord info if you want to chat about it a bit
---
I mean technically there is one in storm wind park but at level 10 they'd have to go back to darnassus anyway for their bear form quest. 
---
&gt; That being said that is why I kind of want them to nerf the dick off of instance farming.
---
What a phenomenal way for Blizzard to get me to keep my promise to never spend another cent on a Blizzard product.
---
You think anyone has ever been banned because someone who disliked them set up a bot, and used it to send gold to an unsuspecting player?
---
You really have no clue what you're talking about. For starters revenge has a cooldown and shield block isn't on the GCD. Prot warrior tanking rotation is shield block -&gt; shield slam -&gt; revenge -&gt; Sunder x2 -&gt; Repeat with each cycle taking 6 seconds. Mix in heroic strikes when possible since they aren't on the GCD. That rotation without even including any heroic strikes works out to 10 rage used per second.
---
We won't be available to use currently available 1.12.1 addons for Classic WoW.  
---
I tried that durning the Demo version of Classic WoW and no addons worked.  
---
From what I heard from Addon creators is that as soon as the beta becomes available they will start making addons for Classic WoW.
---
Having lots of fun?
---
Yes. It will be exactly like the old days.
---
I love this. I'd clear the way for your suicide run if I could. My first pet was also one of the spotted nightsabers in Teldrassil, and she went everywhere with me through 60. My friends scratched, patted, hugged and emoted with her like an actual pet. I don't even remember taming any other pets to learn higher level skills. The one time I pulled out another pet (tested the AV wolf when it had crazy run speed), they all freaked out. When I deleted my character, I went back to Teldrassil, stuffed her with her favorite food (roasted quail apparently), and freed her. If I roll a hunter, I'll probably go for another spotted nightsaber and imagine him or her as a descendent of my old friend. Incidentally her name was Siri lol. I wonder if my wow friends thought of her when it became an iPhone thing.
---
I want to make the opposite journey. Take a gnome up to Darnassus to start grinding mount rep. Plus I didn't think I ever did many of the NE quests, so it'll be a new experience for me.
---
It’s a picture of me meeting your grandmother.
---
The very hint of a 'hardcore' game brings out the edgelords who haven't emotionally matured past the age of 14.  Ignore them.
---
Oh yeah, I don't imagine the players crushing stuff on private servers are going to have any trouble, and I won't be shocked if you can get good threat with different gear and buff choices with fury either.
---
uhh no? If your binds are seriously 1-= and alt 1-= and you put an ability you need to hit quickly and reflexively on alt + - you are not a good player. I'll say that with 99.9% confidence. 
---
Unless you have absurdly huge freak hands you really shouldn't go passed 8 and normal people should stop around 6. 
---
That’s Adam Sessler, you uncultured swine.

---
SoC proc with a 3.8 wep will do more damage than 5 SoR procs unless you have a significant amount of spell power
---
Hunter and Warlock best by far for 1vX. The reason why is both ranged to be able to kite, cc for 1 target, a lot of damage, don't go oom that fast and if they do not a big problem (life tap / auto shot) etc.
---
Good movie cuz if you fall asleep at the beginning of any fight by the time you wake up its still not over ! 
---
life is not rip if the time you spent with that character yielded memories, friends, or personal triumph =)
---
I'd just like to be able to use the modern UI. The player health frame that floats around your characters feet and the modern nameplates with castbars mean I don't really use addons in BFA.
---
The only real game changing addons I use are DBM and GTFO. Everything else is pretty minor like angry keystones to add +1/2/3 chest markers to the mythic+ timer. Details damage meter so I can balance my pull sizes for damage taken vs the healers healing.
---
Would be neat if somebody could make a dungeon journal addon that works like the default UI. As an atlas replacement for loot tables and a tl;dr list of boss mechanics.
---
I played a blood elf BM Hunter for most of BC. I don't remember the specifics anymore, but I had some macro that I found that basically did my entire DPS rotation for me and my pet. So I bound it to my mouse wheel and just "scrolled" through raids. All I had to do was burn trinket cooldowns.  It was great.
---
Finally someone logical in this thread. There's no way classic won't stagnate after many years unless fresh servers are released. I don't get how so many people can't see this. Pretty much everyone I've met in this sub is like "but you'll never get tired of naxx"... it's not about naxx, it's about preserving the leveling rush as you call it.
---
I just pictured Cartman reading that.
---
You don't?
---
How are you going to throw up like 3 curses then fear a guy lmao 
---
There’s an easy workaround:  WoW Tokens
---
Remember, to play Classic, you must also have a retail subscription. That means I can negotiate a trade with another player such as “1000g in Classic for a Token in retail” or “10000g in retail for 500g in Classic” etc.
---
Standing around stormwind though you can put on those sweet felheart pieces. Easy enough to switch with an add-on when you enter a dungeon.
---
Oh yea, the information he provided is very useful, no arguing that. And I'm not going to claim that I'm a great tank or anything, I'd like to believe I'm above average having cleared naxx in a respectable time frame after its release on the server but Skarm is probably a better tank then me in skill. In fact, I'm fairly confident he is but his overall impact on raid teams and guilds were largely negative due to his raid personality. It's entirely possible he's mellowed out now that he has BIS and doesn't feel the need to constantly bounce guilds to take loot and run.  
---
Only thing I really contest is his standpoint of Druid tanks being largely biased. He's babied his druid character for over a year now and enjoys it which isn't an issue in and of itself. An example would be his insistence that bears take less damage as hateful strike soaks for patchwerk when our own raid logs on bwl geared warriors with gear sets meant for patch take less damage for a longer progression fight.
---
There are also gaming keypads. I had a wolf king keypad that put so many different buttons within one hand's reach that I didn't need to use alt for anything special. It broke during the cata expansion (ironic, right?), But by then the number of abilities used at once was so simplified that I just started using the same set of keys on the regular keyboard, I just couldn't reach half of them without moving my hands any more. *Shrug* I'm gonna really miss that keypad once classic drops, I think.
---
I'm sorry, but you're not going to be able to do that. Even if you can come up with something decent it will never amount to the fifteen years of optimization the community at large has done.
---
I’m sorry but how much of a buster do you have to be to help someone like that because he’s the guild leader. Try that shit now a days you’ll get a collective 39 fuck off 
---
Are we browsing two different subs? Just about the only thing I see is people circlejerking about how much min-maxers ruin the game and how no one can tell them how to play. If someone dare suggest you play the game half decently, they are down voted to hell.
---
Get yourself on vanilla friends!! https://www.vanillafriends.com
---
having autoattack bound is correct, startattack macros are unreliable and can fuck your targeting up sometimes
---
I've only ever played a healer in WotLK, and never played anything in Vanilla, but when the Classic servers drop I'm planning to roll as a Priest healer main.
---
I really enjoyed healing because, for me, it's low pressure but still fun.  In general:
---
- There are no damage meters you have to worry about.
---
- You aren't responsible for maintaining crowd control.
---
- You don't have to worry about pulling or kill orders.
---
- If you pull aggro on a mob it's usually someone else's fault, unlike when the DPS does it.
---
- Everyone will do their best to keep you alive.
---
- If the tank pulls before you're ready, well that's on him if the group wipes.
---
But all of those points aren't to say that healing is easy or boring.  Some of my most thrilling moments were healing a party through a bad pull, a broken CC, or just a bad tank.  (I hold nothing against bad tanks as long as they're willing to learn.  All tanks are bad at *some* point.)
---
This vanilla hunter all-in-one rotation macro is pretty strong.

    /cast Auto Shot

Other than the fact that he's a wizard.

What kind of asshole downvotes this guy who went out of his way to help everyone in this sub?
---
Awesome footage ! This reminds me of all the good times.
---
Give it 2-3 months and the graphs from 'What people think they want to play' and the actual 'lvl 60 population' will be vastly different
---
You told him you'd edit it out... you betrayed him.
---
Dunno whether it's popular or not. But we are paying for classic with the retail subscription. This means access to classic is subject to the retail EULA. So not bots and scripts. This means no decursive, no healbot, no dps bots for certain classes as those simply won't work.
---
And that puts it on the center button in the back row. Also terrible. 
---
I had heard about WoW on My Space and other places online, but in all honesty it was this review that sold me.
---
I loved everything about X Play, the humor, the reviews they did of the games I had played or did play were accurate to me and 14ish year old me had the biggest crush on Morgan Webb.
---
I never played with a single addon, though I can obviously see the benefits of them. I think I’m against them for classic though, only because I think some addons can provide advantages to people who know about and use them. 
---
For example, I can’t remember it’s name, but there is one addon that allows you to swap gear quickly during a fight. That’s maybe the most unfair addon I can think of, but someone who knows more about it might be able to add more. 
---
two male trolls, wow
---
This actually comes up quite a lot in this subreddit and people tend to forget. Blizzard have made multiple statements regarding the patch classic will run on and have stated that "Classic WoW will run on Patch 1.12 Drums of War, in which all Classic raids were available--but on modern code. The data format is similar to the format used back in December 2017 for the Patch 7.3.5 PTR." Now obviously this isn't exactly going to be 7.3.5 and I do expect blizzard to update the client to 8.0 but it's still going to be some amalgamation of the modern client. This means that as it stands right now, no addons will work at all, from any game version without being modified to support this "classic client" There are a lot of things we won't get to see that we had back then, and decursive in its original state will be one of them. Unless blizzard decides to re-enable a lot of the API functions that they removed from the game due to fear of automisation of game elements. It seems pretty safe to assume that they won't be doing so, in which case any addons from legion onwards have the ability to be ported over without much hassle. I really doubt blizzard want AVR to exist again.
---
Warlock and mage.
---
Well it is a bit context dependent - 
---
Out in the world PvP, a lot of times the person who wins is just determined by who gets the jump on whom. Rogues are obviously pretty good at this, and hunters basically can't lose if they get their preferred engage against an unmounted target at 41yrds.
---
That said, in duels (or maybe just a 1v1 in a BG) the strongest class with optimal gear is SL warlock, hands down. They are extremely tanky, have good CC, and do tons of damage. And they are even able to counteract a lot of CCs that might be used on them with a felhunter. Other than them, I think mages are very strong, and shadow priests are extremely good at lower gear levels. 
---
Maybe not, but trying is what makes it fun.
---
What I find funny about this is my guild back in Vanilla had a Fury tanking warrior. We used it much more conservatively than he does but it's interesting to see that being an actual thing hardcore guilds might do now.
---
When should it get released? June/July..... when will it get released? Probably September cause ya know it’s Blizz I mean Activision
---
&gt; multiple enemies at once
---
SL Lock, Mage.

Kalecgos

Well let's not be hasty. I just hadn't considered that I might.

Pet happiness only decays when you're online and you have it summoned, and it doesn't decay from being hit, only time and death will make it unhappy.

Yeah I realize that. It was just shocking to me coming from vanilla/BC.

We are a New Zealand &amp; Australian based guild, we are being reborn once again for classic. This time round we're looking at a semi-hardcore approach, we will be pushing to clear content as quickly as possible. While our goal in classic is to clear all raid content in an efficient manner while maintaining a relaxed &amp; Fun atmosphere.

What kind of mats should we hold on to that will become profitable in later patches? Someone on another thread said that elemental earth becomes very expensive once aq40 is out, but before that it's not very profitable. Are there any other mats that can be collected and sold later? Like moon cloth when zg is released? 
---
Timber! Level 10(?) Rare mob that I still have to this day. First and last pet.
---
Will depend on sharding thinking about it now. Might be easy to get to 150ish mining.
---
Not what I was thinking then. Great picture though!
---
Maybe, with the release of Wow Classic, they will be reunited.   A new staff reforged, one they both can share.  Wait.... bind on equip, never mind, they are screwed.   
---
The demo was just a proof of concept. No one said it was 100% authentic, especially not Blizzard. Most bugs were met with the response "Yes, we know that." 
---
&gt; They are a small group of testers working 8 hours a day. Not 7 millions of players, some nolifing 20 hours a day.
---
Well, if they are starved for dev resources it's best to not bother them with inaccurate bug reports. We had a hundred thousand no-lifers complaining about the "incorrect" Warlock summon, even producing screen shots and videos. They were still just wrong.
---
I'm not saying I would not appreciate a beta, not least to get add-ons ready, but you're making a panic for no good reason. 
---
Yea sweeping strikes + whirlwind with a 2 hander is alot of threat but also you will take lots of damage.

&gt;I’ve read that BRD wont work cause of the mobs actually using root/net
---
You've read the bullshit then. Not every mob uses the net. 
---
Sounds like he sold it to the auction company, they could never actually sell it to a person, so he stole he back from the auction company
---
What are your thoughts on troll vs undead for vanilla horde priest race, having experience as a troll?
---
The entire raid has stealth. The raids will probably go fine, and the guild pvp would be hilarious.
---
&gt;I’ve read that BRD wont work cause of the mobs actually using root/net.
---
Do you think every mob in there will cast the net? LOL.
---
It's EASILY farmable with mage, and can yield 60-90+ gold (short vs long run + depends if you've got mining or not)
---
Unless you have some inside information about the current state of classic you can’t say what it does and doesn’t need.
---
My first character was one of every class to level 4 to train some skills to get a feel of the class... because 13 year old dumbass me didn’t realize each class had a page in the manual that explained some key moves.
---
This. It depends which classes you’re talking about which is actually the best. Hunter/mage is great vs warrior/rogue/enhancement, warlock is great vs druid/mage.
---
I forgot how *amazing* the male troll laugh was. 
---
The back row is actually the second easiest row to reach by using the ball of your thumb.
---
Legitimizing gold buying and selling in the version of wow where gold is a vital part to almost everything would be worse than probably any of the other things people are worried about being added (sharding, loot trading, etc.) it would automatically ruin the economy and blizz knows it. 
---
It’s no coincidence that the wow token was added to wow in a time when gold became almost completely unnecessary to playing at even the highest level. It was almost entirely for cosmetics and still is. Blizz isn’t stupid. Its not going to be in classic.
---
Anyone that thinks it’s a good idea or is going to happen has no idea what they’re talking about.
---
Oh wow you're using RTX, I didn't think I would see that addon ever again. You guys truly were tryhards. 
---
Remember when people were cringe enough to require you to sign up on a website? I remember when, do you think we will see that level of fedora tipping in this one?
---
Even by vanilla wow standards, that amount of honor is incredibly low. 
---
Was actually gonna comment something similar myself. Having hordes of players suffering from collective Barenstain Bears episodes would only serve to hinder Blizzard, not help them. Forcing them to triple check stuff that is already correct would eat up a lot of their precious time. It would be cool for a beta so that we could get a head start on add-ons though.
---
I vaguely remember a video of mages killing Ragnaros, but I don't think it was 40 mages. I think they had someone tanking and possibly a healer or two.
---
If we are talking about 'hit one of X, retreat and hit them again' then plenty of options are on the table for specific classes. But in a general 'I go into X people' there is no clear winner when you assume that people of our day and age know about living action (not available at release), free action (available) and restorative potions (available), crystal of zin (available, ally exclusive)
---
Mages need reliable roots/slows and/or poly depending on their targets. fap and resp eliminate that completely
---
same goes for warlocks. Dots and fear? while resp can be removed by a felhound this means he/she will lack a succubus for control people for the vs X component
---
Hunters can outrun multiple people on the long run, but they can't prevent some people to stay behind mount up and chase them down with epic mounts. Even if you were to count disco rays to dismount people. As the hunter who is in range to use it, is also him/herself in range of the person who is chasing him/her
---
rogues, priest. lol nope 1vX on equal terms they get anihilated
---
A warrior may be able to take one person with him/her but when people focus on controlling the warrior and go in against him/her in sync after the charge initiation (assuming you want to start with the best case scenario)
---
Shaman and druid? not really. Though they may be able to pick one off and make a run for it afterwards if a body of water is nearby.
---
Paladin 1vX on equal gear and consumables? bubble heart or corpse run - those are the options there.
---
I leveled on a popular pserver a year ago and I noticed the most popular classes were warrior &amp; rogues. 
---
Can absolutely confirm it was faster than FFXI. Most abilities have anywhere between a 5 second cooldown and an hour long cooldown with 3+ second cast times. 
---
WoW was even faster than Toontown.
---
Might be the way I hold it but that wouldn't work for me. Seems like a stretch anyways, much more likely he's just the average vanilla player with awful binds. 
---
I loved tanking in vanilla - I was a (bad) offtank, never really got into the higher-level nuances until we started clearing BWL, and by then most top-end guilds were falling apart due to TBC beta-release, and realizing their runs in Naxx were basically pointless.  
---
So I heard about someone from our server's top guild tanking as fury/prot, but only for BWL/AQ40 clears (they didn't bother with anything less). We talked some, as they were friendly and helped my guild with strategies, as well as pulling some of our tanks for Naxx (I wasn't invited - I never completed the attunement).  
---
But I do remember pulling threat off our main tank as off tank when he tried going fury/prot. Even rage-starved, as OT on some bosses w/out taunt you have to maintain high threat, and my threat would get so high sometimes I had to auto-attack or stop hitting the boss altogether while in defensive stance. Even a single shieldslam crit and I would pull aggro.  
---
Now, our MT wasn't amazing at building threat, but he was full T2 with some T3, and even with all of that DPS gear, fury/prot and such, he still couldn't hold aggro off of a T1 shieldslam/imaple OT.   
---
Of course, that was once I had enough defense I could spec out of anticipation, but that was the basic principle: Your gear will always dictate how you should spec. And if you are progressing quickly, you will have to adjust your spec from week to week depending on the encounters you are learning, available consumables, and what gear you get to drop.  
---
So point being, there really isn't a "min/max" way to do this. You have to be smart about it, and figure out how to get where you're going without a GPS guiding your every step. And to me, that was the most beautiful thing about vanilla... it was like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get!
---
Maybe. My thumb is positioned to line up exactly with that row, so I just press straight down without stretching or bending my thumb.
---
DAE min-maxers bad? xD
---
I am going Troll Warrior Tank. Will feel nice to be somewhat unique among all other warriors. 
---
well. rip sleep. thanks!
---
Step 1 in making a wand for a dwarf priest: Play a night elf.
---
K.
---
August hopefully, that's when my vacation is...the whole month. Thumbholding and stuff...
---
On Nost/Elys, I OT'd and MT'd several fights on my druid.  They're actually quite powerful.  I would say that a geared druid pulls more threat than a tank; the constant maul crits are insane.  I pulled off of MT's frequently, and had to watch it.  As Skarm admits, we're not the best for any sort of fear fights, and you have to be mindful of the very rare chance we get crit on ends up a dead bear or a hurt one.  A good healer can easily mitigate this.  Also cat druids are dps machines if you know how to play them and willing to put in the work. 
---
my very first character ended at 60. Got to level 60 on January 2nd, 2005. She was the most beautiful Undead Warlock you'd ever put eyes on 🔥
---
Gear in vanilla always dictated spec. If you have a good group of players who level quickly and know how to play/CC targets well, then you can use shieldslam/impale easily as you progress through late 50's and early lvl 60 dungeons.   
---
But if you are relying on pugs, and end up with bad CC or poorly geared healers/dps, you will likely need to have the full "turtlespec" prot just for survivability. Otherwise it'll be a super frustrating experience!  
---
Same goes with raiding - if you end up with an MC raid where everyone is in all lvl 60 blues/BiS green items (trust me, there's a few - like the lvl 58 green cape with +healing), then sure, go for better threat and have fun. But if DPS is bad, healers are bad, or your own tanking gear doesn't provide sufficient mitigation/avoidance, well, spec for it!
---
Yeah, got me bummed out again that BFA was such a fat joke of an expansion
---
Archimonde bois
---
Well, his one guild mate in chat seemed to be disappointed when he didn't get any honor, lulz.
---
It's the humidity, really.  There are maybe two months out of the year that don't feel like you're swimming through the air if you're lucky.
---
If you like that color nightsaber, you want the moonstalker matriarch from darkshore 1.2 atk speed. The lvl 1 nightsaber has 2.0 atk speed.
---
I don't understand why that site isn't stickied on this sub. 
---
Our server highly favored alliance so we had 45 min BG queues and a low honor cap. Plus this was *very* early in the PVP system—and overall game—as Jubei was the server's 1st rank 13.  
---
It got more competitive as things went on. In queue, I had to farm HKs at Kargath to take #1 standing and push to rank14.
---
Shattered Hand stand up!
---
One can only hope! 
---
Your type of guild was fairly common in Vanilla, in my experience. The top 2-3 guilds on my server would go all out on Buffs for progression but that’s about it. There were probably 10-15 more casual raiding guilds that didn’t bother outside of maybe Ony, because you would go do Ony first on raid nights and pick up the buff on your way to the next raid.
---
Yeah, alliance had 45 min BG queues and this was very early in the PVP system—and overall game. Jubei was the server's 1st rank14.
---
This happened to me. Deleted my character, had a wank, and restarted my druid.
---
rename to Behind the Scenes of Vanilla World of Warcraft?  
---
Vanilla is the original  
---
Classic is the new remake
---
Youll be too short to talk to any of the quest givers.
---
Almost everything is worse, the old API was open, the current API isn't. The old api lets you get the exact distances between players, the new one doesn't. 
---
Hey, I played Priston Tale too for a tiny bit!  It was one of several Korean MMOs I tried out at the time.  It wasn't bad, but it was just...okay; pretty generic and mediocre to me even back then and was a very textbook example of a Korean MMORPG where the only thing you do is grind.  But still, at least you got to see how WoW revolutionized the genre.
---
I'm contemplating starting a huge and social Horde guild with "mediumcore" raiding. What I want is raid loot in a relaxed setting that still downs bosses. For me, the real dream is only one required raid night per week in which we try to be efficient but still laidback (this was how I approached Mythic raiding when I led my guild in WOD and Legion; we were on a small server but consistently were top 5 despite being more nonchalant). An additional, non-required raid night could be formed to knock out 20 mans and farm content, but I see it just being free rolls (maybe with especially powerful items designated ahead of time as "core raider" priority).
---
My hesitations are that:
---
1. Other guilds would probably poach our players pretty often. This could be reduced, I think, if we had a decent enough set of players from these forums who joined us in advance because they believed in our mission. This is the case for basically every guild, though.
---
2. We may not be able to advance very far into the "tough stuff." I think this is true to an extent (especially if we are hampered by only one official raid night), but with enough perseverance I think we could definitely enter Naxx and one day finish it. If we got brickwalled, we could always find another similar-situation guild and work together to down bosses. This is risky and would require superior coordination and understanding to work.
---
3. I've led guilds for nearly 10 years now, and I'm thinking it might be best to just kick back and relax this time (as I did back in Vanilla). Every time I envision those scenarios, though, I simultaneously imagine horrible things like the guild I'm in dissolving just as I have accrued enough DKP to buy that next big upgrade, a toxic or incompetent raid leader, etc.
---
I'll probably fish this idea (single-night raiding) again closer to release and test its viability. I can see it being a popular option for more competitive people like me who are also highly constrained by their IRL schedules.
---
&lt;One Night Stand&gt; ... &lt;Hebdomadal&gt;
---
/shrug
---
Yeah, Shattered Hand sure horde had it rough. Alliance side probably had the most competitive raid scene of any server. (Definitely during BWL as Drama and DnT battled back and forth for server and world firsts.) There was also WarEnsemble, which went on to fully clear Naxx, Skyfang itself was very strong, and Purge competed for outdoor bosses.  
---
What was your character on SH?
---
My keyboard has two alt keys, one on the left and one on the right. Alt-0, Alt--and Alt-= are the easiest combinations to reach with your left thumb on the right alt key.
---
That's assuming they aren't using a keypad or a programmable keyboard. Or thinking maybe that they have been using that setup for years and can hit they key combination with muscle memory. It's not like WoW PvE requires amazing reaction time.
---
Any of these sound more likely than the hypothesis that a Naxx raider is a total idiot who can't play. I think it's a pirate server thing, they have some kind of weird emotional need to shit on the people who cleared real Naxx in retail in 2006, so they can feel better about only having cleared an ezmode guesswork pirate version using 2019 hardware.
---
Have your brother roll a warrior for great duo leveling and instant tank healer for a group. 
---
The downvotes tell the story, that was a master troll that caught at least thirty people. Kudos.
---
You can hit numpad - with your right thumb (if you're a righty). It's a lot more convenient than having it on a key you have to move your hand to hit.
---
for maximum try hard you can mind control certain mobs and use them to buff or cc others in dungeons.  one i can remember is the mobs in zul farrak that cast hex, you can mc them, hex a mob then continue healing and they wont re hex another target. 
---
but honestly its just like dpsing and tanking, some enjoy it some dont.  i like tanking and healing but find dps boring.  play a pserver and heal the first dungeon ?
---
This is true. Mark Kern and John Staats both confirmed the world in Classic is balanced around 3k players.
---
if you're alliance definitely try an owl since they'll be easy to grab for you, also the most efficient grinding pet
---
boars havent decent stats and a great charge for pvp, and something people tend to forget is that they literally eat anything so you can just give him the various food drops you scavenge instead of constantly buying or cooking stuff
---
None of those this 6 bothered be me. What got to me was their damn big ass FEET. I had a 60 Troll Mage I had to reroll because I couldn't take it anymore. I loved everything else about him though. I really like the Troll spellcast animation, reminds me of Hadoken from Street Fighter. I like their skin tones, their faces, didn't even mind they're hunch. Feet. Why couldn't they have shoes, or at least robes that covered them better?
---
Im just worried it will no longer be possible come classic, as a bug or not, its a bit odd of a teleport, its soooo good though. If it it works on retail right now then i think it would work in classic.  Im not subbed though to try it
---
&gt; [Ahh I forgot about Thunder Bluff.](https://youtu.be/LYxU7pIJHhk?t=2995)
---
Honestly that sounds about right.
---
 great effort was put into animations... hence why all race appropriate mounts clip with female characters ;)
---
Nice try
---
If you quest in Silithus before AQ, save all your Encrypted Twilight Texts for people who realize they need rep only AFTER the gates open. Don't wait too too long after -- but do wait til the gates are open.
---
Elemental fires (fire prot) will get more expensive when BWL drops as will grave moss (shadow prot). Stranglekelp will go up before AQ. The mats for LIPs FAPs and the different levels of dynamite will also get more expensive as BGs open.

---
Keep your hearth by the trainer?
---
I dont see the problem part.
---
Not confirmed, and there were wayyy more vanilla servers than there ever will be Classic servers. At least for the launch period, partially due to sharding. 
---
Best we can hope for is a mapping from Blizzard. Say x,y,z server should go to server 1 etc... Of course some people will get pissy if their old server gets stuck on a streamer server or something. 
---
That's nice to hear. Yeah I think the huge benefit of having a feral tank is that their DPS while not tanking is competitive. It is an amount of flexibility a Prot Warrior cannot provide. The more I research this and talk to people who experienced it the more I'am convinced that we didn't understand nearly well enough back in the day.
---
&gt;not counting high level gankers
---
They definitely do count. Horde don't have to deal with high level gankers until like level 30 if they don't want to hit up Ashenvale or STM.
---
That +5 crit is nuts too...melee love us &lt;3
---
I see what you did there 😉
---
My main character's name will be my irl name.
---
In my guild, we would typically have the OT maintain sunder armor once the MT put up the first 2. That way the MT would have less to monitor during moving fights - it was simply survival, threat and where to stand at that point.
---
The more organized the better 
---
You won't realise until you hear about it from everyone who already took your favourite name.
---
I had the same sword and rocked the T1 shoulders on my warrior for so long... When that sword procced with crusader at the same time the mortal strike crits would get huge.
---
on my druid i would stealth farm Mara for ghost mushrooms .
---
Locks and shadow priest drop serious coin on them.
---
Oh but games have been released unexpectedly, such as EA did with  “Apex Legends”.  All these people planning holidays and days off won't much like it.  And your favourite names will be taken in all likelihood.  Although assasshehhe should be safe, I'd have thought.
---
But Bliz probably won't do that.
---
Having said that, I plan to sub just a day beforehand.
---
In BC, devasate/SS was all I needed. Revenge was a nice proc, and I'd pop shieldwall on CD, then use HS to burn rage, usually if I was above 40 rage. I'm not sure how anyone even had problems with threat in BC - it was super easy, unless you had too much avoidance.  
---
Your BC experience sounds like my vanilla experience though - but if you want to have a real chance to tank in classic, if it is anything like my experience in vanilla, druids will almost certainly be "out" as tanks by the time AQ40 is opened up. Private servers seem to make it work, but I am highly skeptical it will be the same - there's too much going on there to speculate, so I'm just going off of my past experience 15 years ago. Which says chances are if you roll druid, you'll be stuck as an OT or healer only.
---
Not to be a downer but...
---
*HPS meters are athing, mostly in raids. Measuring your HPS in 9/10 cases completely unrelated to how good of a healer you are, but good luck convincing the other people that.
---
*Shackle is a thing in Scholo and Strat.
---
*That is correcr.
---
*A badly timed Renew or PWS can cause chaos. Usually when the tank hasn't builr up the group aggro.
---
*Rarely in a PUG.
---
*True but they still do it, even when you spam "need mana" in pchat.
---
Wait are you talking about using the numbers on the keyboard? I use a razor naga. Then alt/shift/ or ctrl + 1 through =
---
So I essentially have 36 different keybinds I can access instantly
---
Watching stuff like this makes me super hyped for some world pvp when classic comes out!
---
Yea I’m 6’7 so I have massive hands. I probably misunderstood you. I assumed everyone uses a 14 key mouse these days.
---
Look it up on youtube, this worked for me on a private server. 
---
You actually make a lot of valid points here - the only time I ever had rage issues in vanilla was as an OT trying to maintain threat on a taunt-immune boss when I wasn't taking damage. THAT was hard. Once I got slapped a few times, though, it wasn't so bad -  simply keep shield block up on CD, revenge on CD, and I'd have enough rage to dump shieldslam on CD while using heroic strike nearly every blow. Never lost aggro that way.  
---
In fact, come to think of it, I knew some warriors who made macros for every single ability, encorporating a "cast heroic strike" option at the end - that way they weren't spamming that one ability, it was simply used 100% of the time, since rage wasn't an issue when being hit (unless you were full T3 in LBRS with 440+ defense...)
---
Is this from the collectors edition or? 
---
this is the easter egg rumor right? 
---
Yup, I agree. I honestly wish they would disable world buffs inside raids, it obviously won't happen, but one can dream.
---
Organized is a funny word for that I think, we did just fine with job applications. I think discord could be a better use, but needing my email and a write up just goes over my head.
---
So underrated. Free heal and or chain lightning with the stun time
---
TheRealRecollector posted a lot on this thread - he's actually saying that ShieldSlam/Impale spec is far better than fury/prot.  
---
Not sure what his rotation is, but he's more or less stating exactly how I remember it from 2006. ShieldSlam is best for threat, but you have to keep shieldblock up on CD, while Revenge is best for threat-to-cost ratio. This comment thread is more in response to sunder usage, which in my experience was mostly relegated to OT's, while the MT focused on the best threat/survival options (because you don't need shieldblock while you're not holding aggro).  
---
In fact, iirc, we didn't even prioritize sunder until the target was being DPS'd, and then it was used mostly for max DPS/threat generated by damage done, not by simply applying it.
---
Rank to 13, ez life.
---
I don't think one side or another will attract "higher quality" players, it's just a preference and people are people. The main difference on the recent largest pservers has been a slightly larger alliance pop (51-53%), but more horde pvpers regardless, and longer queue times for them because of that. That creates a situation with a lot more horde players ganking while waiting for queue.
---
SO MUCH THIS IT MAKES ME SO ANGRY IDK WHY
---
I didn't play Undead priest so I can only talk about Trolls.
---
First of all Berserking is significant for both healing and DPS as a Priest. If you get low enough to get the full amount that is. I never personally tried the following because I wasn't an engineer but I think you could do shenanigans with Darkrunes and Goblin Sapper Charges to get your maximum Berserking value in PvE. It is a good ability for solo content and PvP as it also decreases your GCD.
---
Secondly you will get a Priest racial ability called Hex of Weakness, which reduced the physical damage output of your target by a flat amount and will also decrease the healing received by 20%. It is a cheap, spammable curse (only Druids and Mages can remove it) and useful for mostly for PvP. In PvP you should spam this ability, preferably the rank 1 version.
---
Third you get the Priest racial called Shadow Guard. This works similar as the Shaman's Lightning Shield and looks the same. But it will apply shadow damage so it can procc Blackout (shadow talent tree). It is a very strong PvP ability as well.
---
Strictly for PvP I would say Troll Priests are superiour to Undead Priests because of these two powerful abilities and Berserking. The Undead abilities/racials are good too, but just not quite as good as the Trolls. Even if you don't spec Blackout I value the other talents higher, mostly because of how consistently good Hex is.
---
For PvE Troll priests have Berserking which can increase your healing output (or DPS) by a significant amount. I've had many situations where this racial came in handy. But Undead have nicer base stats for casters. If you are a healer in PvE and make very good use of Berserking, not just spam it to try to inflate the healing meter, then it is definitely a stronger perk than having slightly better base stats.
---
Yes
---
+3% not +5%
---
but yes, melee and the overall amount of damage dealt across the raid does love us

Late September please.

My SF group once ran past a chest so I waited till we killed the boss and everyone left and during the timer I ran back and looted the chess for some fine blue stuff. Good times

Grinding beasts out in the world. Hopefully those Hillsbrad turtles don't have too much more armor than they do on Pservers!
---
You meet a lot of cool people willing to help out and/or group up.  
---
I tried quest helper but I dislike something telling me what to do or where to go..  you don't know me! Quit telling me I'm going the wrong way!
---
I've used a couple guides before but I don't stick to them very closely.  I mostly use it for the info of knowing where the next region I can go grab quests at.
---
Ty for the more balanced approach to this discussion. I will keep this in mind when watching the next "Deep Dive", since they both seem eager to do a tank Druid version. I find it interesting that some specs we deemed to be suboptimal like feral Druid, enh Shaman, sPriest are valued more now, but I'am also wary and want to understand the strengths and weaknesses thouroughly.
---
I mean people with average sized hands should probably stop their binds at like 6. 6-Y-H-B is as far as I would go. 
---
Ahh, you're right.  But heck yeah.
---
They both did decent, the blind and then bandage after the enemy rogue almost raped him 100-0 while stunned was good, and they were way outnumbered lol
---
LotP is a 3% crit aura if that is what you were referring to. Pretty good yes.
---
Yea but not on the mouse right?

Going with Pigfucker this time 
---
nah on the keyboard, I'm not going to tell you how to use your chopstick length fingers either 
---
It's a good plan, but have you thought about skinning+mining for the warrior? Skin every mob and vendor the leather, mine every vein you find and bank the mats. When you're ready at high level, you should have enough ore and stone to level both engineering and blacksmithing, and skinning should hopefully have put you over the top to get level 40 mount.
---
Couldn't agree more. Just the promise of stable servers not in risk of closure every single day makes me want to throw away a million Naxx geared toons.

One problem I had in Vanilla is that I was a super slow leveler, and after a certain point any time I asked for help I just got told to go look up a particular guide or use a particular addon, nobody really paid attention to the quest anymore. 
---
I actually precisely remember I was leveling in thousand needles trying to figure out where the heck to go, got told to download quest helper for the 30th time and just did it, don't think I read another quest until the end of Wrath when I quit. (I LOVED it at the time but now I realize it took something away from the experience.) 
---
I know a lot of people will be interested in communicating more this time around, I'm just hoping a sizable enough crowd will seek/provide help that is more than just a link to their guide. 
---
This makes me want to roll a Troll. 
---
My guild thought they were lame in Vanilla, so we never bothered with them. There's something to be said for doing content without being buffed out the gills for the experience of working together and overcoming rather than trying to speed run your way through the content.
---
Scorpid, specifucally Death Flayer in Durotar. 1.6 attack speed but enough armor to tank elites and does decent damage due to poison.
---
I want importing of legacy characters so I don’t have to do all that grinding again.
---
I didn't have problems with threat, I said I had problems with rage on many fights if spamming HS. I don't look back on my tanking experience in TBC as particularly hard from a micro standpoint, it was mainly about knowing where to move mobs, managing threat on multiple mobs, knowing generally when certain boss abilities are coming, etc - the macro stuff. Your first couple sentences were spot on from my experience, it's just that I wasn't over 40 rage on as many fights as I see pserver vanilla tanks on.
---
About druid - that's fine if they will be OT... there's only 1 real MT position, if you're one of the top 3 tanks then that's achievable, and you use the warrior MT for most of the content especially stuff that requires stance dancing, etc. You'll see a few druid #1 MTs (across all servers combined, many servers won't even have one) but that will be those guys that go way above the call of duty and really know their stuff
---
Chad, Chadman, Chadster, Turbochad, Radchad, Chadtothebone
---
Yeah there are definitely exceptions to all of my points.  I was just speaking in general from my own experience.   
---
 That stuff is good to know, though.
---
topkek
---
&gt;or an example of a good macro that is more situational, I’ll point out the Raptor/Mongoose/Wing Clip - there are plenty of times when I just need a Raptor to finish off a mob, and don’t need to use 3 abilities. Another example is FD/Freeze Trap - great for a surprise PvP scenario, but I would usually use FD to lose aggro during PvE without a need for a trap.
---
Typically you add a modifier like shift to the command to be more specific.  1-&gt; Mongoose/Raptor/Wingclip 
---
Shift 1 is Raptor
---
Ctl 1 is Wingclip
---
Remember you can always turn a 1v3 into a 2v2 with Gnomish Mind Control Cap!
---
what do you mean? for you to buy a token, someone else has to shell out 20 euros where you would normally only sub for 13, it's a great deal for blizz :p
---
In WoW class terms he's definetly a priest. The magic we see him use in the movies is more priest than mage. 
---
We got pretty much all Info we need. All major Questions got answered, now we just need a quick Beta and a Release-Date.
---
Yea but double the amount doesn't really matter since every raid group is going to want like 8 warriors and about 2 druids.
---
Mining is better in the VERY beginning of a fresh server, because those no lifers that rushed to 60 want to level their engineering. After ~1 month herbalism is better and gets even better. 
---
In vanilla I was really stubborn about seeking out of game help.  It's kinda funny back in Everquest you were really looked down upon if you used out of game resources for quest info and what not.   You were labeled Lazy for using spoiler sites.
---
Fast forward to today and you're considered lazy for not using them.  
---
Classic quest for the most part are pretty easy to navigate if you read them a few times.  For the tricky ones I alt/tab out and check a database type site thottbot/classicDB.  In a minimalist way just to get the next step figured out.
---
At any rate I sure hope the friendly folks outweigh the negative types.  Good luck to us all!
---
I tried leveling retail with warmode on, which is supose to phase me into a shard where everyone has war mode on so I could do endless PvP.  Instead the zones were completly empty.  I eventually turned it off because I was starved for social interation of any sort.
---
I can attest to enrage talent not procing with /sit during the blizzcon classic demo for what its worth.
---
&gt; I can attest to enrage talent not procing with /sit during the blizzcon classic demo for what its worth.
---
My reasoning not doing this is that your main (AKA warrior) will not have massive bags while leveling. He also has the added bonus of carrying tanking gear if you like doing dungeons (I do) and bandages / food to heal. Skinning as profitable as it is, fills up your bags insanely fast and with Mining as well you will be constantly vendoring or destroying stuff.
---
I find that when you get to 60 (and your alt is 20+) you can feed even 12 slots bags to him and life is so much easier. Personally I will go as far as to buy big bags as soon as possible to make carrying 2 farming profs that much easier.
---
As if dying was a merit.
---
well yes, paladin buffs do make the bear more durable in a static sense, but heres some things worth considering
---
1) shamans, of which you usually have 6+ per raid constantly yeeting chain heals around the melee/tanks, have their 25% armor buff. it interacts with the priest buff. you can get armor capped super early this way when you ordinarily cant and if you have stable assigns you can hypothetically put more gear (like using a hit % leather belt instead of the 1% parry belt from aq) for even higher threat
---
2) shamans outside of the tank group/melee group deploy -20% threat totem, so you dont have to worry so much about casters pulling. additionally, since windfury is more important than a 3% crit buff, youll likely be kept strictly in the tank group, which ensures you have agi totem to make you even tankier/threatier AND give crit to your fellow warrior tanks on multi-target fights. this is a super nice bonus for them if theyre impale spec :D
---
3) tauren health WILL make you soakier at all times. full-out night elf bear druids at endgame break well past 20k hp. add on that extra hp and you have an ultra mountain
---
4) on ally, most healers tend to be paladins. this means that rolling into well over half of the 5 mans you tank wont have a priest for their armor buff, which is a big deal - especially so in early 5 man farming for your initial sets of gear. if youre on horde, theres going to be resto shamans everywhere
---
5) the rend head buff, should you happen to get it for raiding on a progression kill where youre tanking, sends your threat gen as a bear druid THROUGH THE ROOF. if your melee are amped up on buffs and windfury, at that point, you might *need* to use a bear unless your warriors are really abusing fury/prot builds. that + mcp on pull = enough threat to go afk autoattacking for an hour and still not have threat pulled off of you (warning: this is an exaggeration)
---
- Strat-live righteous orb farm. (You'll need a group for this)
---
- Frost maul e'ko farm. (You'll need a group for this)
---
- Any e'ko farms really.
---
If anyone remembers Ghrash’s YT leveling series - he would chain 9 characters through the same zones all the way to 70 (I think it was at the time.)
---
I plan on taking a page out of his book and leveling 3-4 toons at the same time with rested XP.
---
Mage - Warlock - Warrior - Paladin - park them all in Goldshire at 5, now when I move to Westfall on my Mage I switch, rinse and repeat. When rested EXP runs out I am going to play my main the mage.. 
---
can druid tank? can druid melee? can pally tank? can pally melee? can mage arcane? can warrior melee? can priest dps? etc
---
Seriously, are they aiming to balance or just copy?
---
ok that was very cool
---
Not enuf enagiii

Healing is tons of fun if you're into the idea. Some people complain it's like whack-a-mole and you're just healing bars when they go down, but you can be a better healer if you instead learn and understand the situation at hand, and predict where damage is going to occur, and prepare your heals before the bars go down. Priests' flash heal spell is their least efficient, and they're best when they can throw low cost normal heals and long-cast big heals when they can be utilized. It's a lot of fun when you get the hang of it and understand all the healing and efficiency you're doing, and when shit goes down and you're good enough to throw a ton of heals left and right and save the day, it's the best feeling ever.
---
Hell naw.
---
Its just high stakes whack-a-mole in vanilla 
---
The main problem with leveling a hunter in Elwynn is that there are no hunter trainers in Stormwind. You would have to head back to teldrasil to get upgraded spell ranks.
---
I have a couple curious questions about the debuff system in general when a target has 16 debuffs.
---
Debuffs DO have a priority, right?  Meaning if someone applies a higher-priority debuff, a lower-priority debuff is removed?  And so Deep Wounds really is low priority, like you said?
---
And then, how is it determined which debuff gets removed?  The oldest low priority debuff?  Random from the low priority tier?
---
Finally, has someone made a list of debuff priority tiers?  I feel like that'd be pretty important, but perhaps it's all just merely duration-based, not counting Taunt?  Meaning, is it as simple as a longer debuff always removes the lowest duration debuff?
---
Luvstospooge
---
I read leveling guides to get a general idea of which quests to group up a bit, but don't follow them step by step.  Optimizing questing routes too much takes away from the immersion of the game.  I hate quest helper.  It's a complete buzz kill.  I typically won't pull out wowhead unless I've been stuck on a quest for an extended period.  
---
Yes. 7.3.5 -&gt; 8.0.0 -&gt; 8.1.0 (newest, did not exist at the time)
---
I feel this is going to be the new nax is wotlk meme
---
The great philosopher Adam Carolla once said "No cannot have" and that is what I have to say to you, sir or madam. 
---
You absolutely could multi click felwood buffs. In retail vanilla you could even multi click whipper root tubers and it would multiply them by the number of people doing it.
---
I agree with it being a terrible game design though, especially with Dragonslayer going to be on a six hour cooldown 
---
Sold it to some Chinese WoW gold/boost/account site. It sat there and was never resold. They tried flipping it before the expansion, no dice on their end. With the expansion out, it's value went down hard. 
---
Yep! 
---
I did personal math when I was tanking on a private server.  Not based on my logs, but based on values pulled from posts from vanilla.  The math I did showed upper 40s, I think around 48% but that's assuming 0 HS.
---
Or if you have an SSD and don't have load times.
---
I'm going to look up quest target locations in case  I'm "Wut? Where do I go?" and probably look for quests with interesting reward in advance, that's all.
---
I think gnogg is already planning on taking that name.
---
Instead of making people not get the buff I feel like it will make people get the buff and just not play
---
Sounds like you are the best regardless of what you touch so why do you care 
---
IIRC they were added with the Brewfest stuff in BRD, which was added in 2.4.
---
Only downside to this is that you will pribably die just after because you won't be able to play while laughing your ass off like a hyena.
---
yeah look at what happened to diablo 3 and the rmah, "people were buying items through other means anyways".  Blizzard wanted a piece of the pie, and there is this turd of a game called diablo 3 XD
---
I do recall that rage from damage taken is very high in Classic and the entire time since then until they normalized it in Catalysm, but yeah uh, it definitely was not that high unless they were tanking 3 things at once.  That's ridiculous.
---
Still, I don't remember Rage being a very serious issue for the actively tanking Warriors in the raids I was in.  Feral Druid Rage hardly needs to be mentioned because it was nearly infinite anyway.
---
Played alpha. Kazee US and Thailand server. The game had shitty support which killed it. I still remember when PIST got the first lvl60 Cleaver non spec. Poor guy was 72, anything 60 was legendary status. 
---
People cry about leveling on WoW. Shit, I remember spending my whole winter vacation grinding. Two weeks off school. 16 hours of grinding every day. JUST FOR 2 LEVELS!!!! I never found a game harsher on level grind than Pre AoR Pristontale. 
---
Easy, run around and get all the flight points you want on your main and maybe do a couple fetch quests, log out at an inn close to where you're gonna level, create your alt, and do the same thing. That'd probably take the whole first day by itself.
---
Ching Chong 
---
- Fully explore zone.
---
- Finish every quest I can find.

- Move to new zone and repeat.

Might look up the zone quest list before moving on in case I missed anything.
---
Yah im lvl 25
---
leveling a bear druid with retribution aura stacked with thorns and a healadin is probably the most fun combination in the game and is efficient if you do it correctly. Can easily take 8 mobs in 20-30 bracket and I imagine more as talents get fleshed out later down the road.
---
As a 13 year old with no experience I found it much more difficult to read quests and finish them without trouble—at least some of them. Others often took me quite a while. 
---
After trying it again recently, I had zero issues at all reading the quests and finishing them without looking anything up. It was very nice and immersive. I even left the slow quest scroll on. And that being said, my leveling speed was still extremely quick even though I was reading quests and fishing and stuff. 
---
I can’t find a source that tribute runs was solo able by hunters on retail. 
---
And I know that mobs sometimes resist fd.  So I’m a bit worried it will not work.  
---
Yep, I definitely don't recall Rage being a very serious issue in the raids I was in.  It's probably that the scaling factor for rage from damage taken is extremely high in Classic (and TBC and Wrath for that matter), so that would mean in dungeons, Rage is pretty normal, but in raids it's all out of whack.
---
He pops both preparation and coldblood, this does not leave many points in combat, using hemo leads to a hemo spec.
---
as long as my name is safe
---
Great analysis! I was always led to believe that UD priest was the king in vanilla wow, especially in PvP. You have greatly convinced me to roll mine as troll instead, thanks!
---
The API is not going to be classic probably closer to legion. There is way too much exploitable stuff in the classic API
---
They'll likely blanket ip ban all of China which is what other recent mmos have done. Back in wotlk I got banned white a few times because the city I lived in had a lot of gold farming operations. Actually got a tour of one a few min from my place it was fking cool.
---
I should rephrase my post, most players didn't put in the effort to learn the encounters fully. They learnt the hard way by wiping all the time and slowly learning from their mistakes.  
---
I tried to come prepared to a raid, by reading various tactics. And learning about my class on elitistjerks. But I remember many of our "casual" guild to just not care and faceroll through the raid.  
---
might be the reason why we never got past eggroom in BWL :)
---
Sure, but the entire idea of flagging is antithetical to a dedicated PvP server where you're at constant danger out in the wild. So you can do it, sure, it's just absolutely not the same thing.
---
This sounds crazy. Do you have a source or any more info?
---
Im already very familiar with the leveling routes
---
So I doubt I will follow a guide to min/max. Im in no hurry.
---
Hah, true!
---
Actually it's a friend that had played EQ that introduced me to the world of Thotbott and afaik all his group were relying on outside source of info to play.
---
I remember he tried to make me play EQ, but I thought the game was stupid : he was just killing toad men for hours. One or two years later I was nolifing on WOW killing Murlocks :D
---
They had to change how they designed fights hecause of add-ons in Legion amd them removed the API feature in BFA. So I disagree with your assessment that add-ons dont change core gameplay. Especially if you played during wrath when an add-on had a patch to specifically remove it because it trivialized ICC
---
To be clear, the +19% miss rate from dual wielding is only for auto-attacks.  Special attacks still have the normal miss rate.
---
It'll be released so it coincides with my annual family vacation... at my grandma's which has no Wi-Fi. Will update when I know the dates (changes yearly). 
---
Well if someone set up a bot on an account only to send gold to another player i would say the suspicion would be pretty high (especially if it happen multiple time). 
---
Though i do know someone on a private server that really hated another guy so he set up a bot to send him gold to make him banned. Idk how they would handle this on retail but if i receive a large amount of gold for no reason from an unknown person i would ask a gm about it.
---
Their modern infrastructure is barely stable even with dropping numbers, if even 100 people flood a zone on the same shard the server lags. Not a huge issue on retail but a game like classic where shards actually damage the experience a stress test would be very important so blizzard can judge how to properly structure realm population numbers and sharding on release (if implemented)
---
Ishnu Alah weary travellor...
---
Warrior 1v3 ? Oh you mean the warrior is in the group of 3 ?
---
The misinformation spread from private server cancer is really annoying. Every time I watch a hamsterwheel video I want to gag. 
---
U pvped and pve with the same heal spec?
---
Did any of you actually play vanilla? The fact that Shadow Priest hasn't been mentioned as much or more as sl lock shows you didn't. 
---
Just like, due to the GearScore stuff, I needed on an item with attack power on a warlock, because it was an upgrade to my GearScore.
---
Then, I rolled a druid on RP realm on patch 4.0.1
---
[www.thottbot.com](https://www.thottbot.com) occassionally, that's it
---
A wow sub in China is cheap. Used to be a time card system with no fees for the expac.  Think they swapped to monthly now though, however the time sink for mmos pushed towards the moba and BR  market.
---
People do watch healmeters
---
The thing is if u are on tank duty then by default u wont be top
---
I agree.  It's only Classic, and to me, having it competitive just makes so many things all kinds of exclusive, removing so much of the game as they contort it into something it's not.
---
Then again, "competitive" PVE has always been incredibly stupid to me, and I've always thought this way about it, so I know I'll never understand it no matter what year it takes place in.
---
 
---
# 🐻
---
well, no Non-PVP realm for me, definitely.
---
There are no hunter trainers in the Human starting zone. So keep that in mind :)
---
For someone that read every part then you clearly don't understand it 
---
He said fresh 60s in starter gear can do strat live in 20 minutes.  My aq gear guild don't think that's possible
---
60g per hour in strat live for 5 fresh 60s isn't realistic, it's based on random drops and good fortune with orbs
---
Super quickly. Done it a few times in Vanilla, pretty confident with my routes, and farm herbs/leather at 60 before the majority get there. Hoping to stock up on things early on.
---
DM is Deadmines unless it includes a cardinal direction
---
Thankyou so much that's perfect!! 
---
... and I'll reserve it for you
---
Ok that's good news! I just hope there *is* a beta - something makes me feel like there won't be one :/ 
---
Worst case is there's no beta and we'll get addons only after a few days/weeks. I guess that would make the launch feel even more vanilla though, so I can't really be against that.
---
Sorry, to clarify, you don’t think it’s possible to get to like 25 with Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge and Duskwood, doing a few dungeons too?
---
Pretty sure there is one in the dwarf district on the right before entering the portal
---
Besides zg no
---
Cuz its kept through wipe
---
Either that or they nerf the popular gold farm methods
---
Unless you can hide in the pack like in AV, if you heal in PVP you become the tank.
---
I remember back in Vanilla my fresh lvl 60 priest, didn't want to play shadow, I just bought the best stam green gear I could find at the AH. I had something like 4k HP and not much mana but it was not necessary. As soon as I would start healing I would get focused immediately.
---
So basicly you account shared to boost yourself tru dungeons?!
---
Wait. Thats Illigal!
---
But I woun't tell because I did the same.
---
U have to avoid the servers tryhards then
---
They are the ones that need the most gold
---
Saying Druid can main tank? Man, people on this sub will go crazy :D
---
Same. You don’t need achievements to be a completionist in Classic.
---
Must be hard to force a group to skip everything until VC, since you're only trying to kill VC instead of just a normal DM run.
---
I like to do every quest I can find, in every zone. When I started I didn't use any addon at all, but after a few hundred quests is started to feel a bit overwhelming so I searched for quest helpers.
---
I plan to use helpers in Classic too but nothing about speed/efficiency. I don't care about leveling fast, I will take my time to enjoy it and read the stories.
---
You're very welcome :) 
---
 &gt; HPS meters are athing, mostly in raids. Measuring your HPS in 9/10 cases completely unrelated to how good of a healer you are, but good luck convincing the other people that.
---
This is unfortunately true. 
---
I played a priest in MC on a dead pserver. In the beginning i was playing not to overheal and conserve mana, but was told by the priest leader ‘you need to do better. From there on i just spammed flashheal til oom and he said ‘much better’ :)
---
Going by memory. And when that's not good enough, I'll thottbot my way through as I did in the good ol' days.
---
Step 1: Be a Dwarf.
---
durring ab weekend on my server the standing one guys had over 1 mill honor for standing 1
---
TBH any class can 1vX you just have to master whatever class you play, people also bagging warriors here, I’ve seen warriors 1v3 max then straight after it without eating just charge into a 1v2 and won both, it all depends on how good you are at a certain class
---
GordonRamsaysFury
---
Anything with dots and cc
---
It almost certainly won't be in at launch, and as you said, the crossbow is BiS. 
---
Hunters have almost the same list as Rogues essentially, which means a lot of competition.
---
Just enjoy the joke. Humour doesn't have to be dead on accurate to fact
---
Yes.
---
Classic would be pay to win.
---
In retail gold does not give an advantage. ( I don't count buying boost for gear or achievments an advantage but you gain nothing besides setting the bar higher for yourself )
---
But in Classic gold means alot. It kills the need to grind/farm wich is a mayor part of the game.
---
You don't have to worry too much about it if you are just a player. Your raid leader will tell you in advance which debuffs you can use and who applies them etc. In some cases only one player of a class will apply a debuff.
---
General rule of thumb: If the debuff only deals damage or doesn't affect the boss in a meaningful way it will not be allowed. Some debuffs are not used/allowed because they don't stack with others. For example Sunder Armor (Warrior) stacks with Fiery Fire (Druid) but not with Expose Armor (Rogue), so Rogues will never apply that debuff.
---
If you want to know more there are many debuff guidelines and discussions for 8 slots and 16 slots to be found. Classic will have 16 slots.
---
Also debuffs have a certain priority tier. For example if the slots are all taken and a higher priority debuff is applied, then a lower priority debuff will disappear. The good thing about this is that the debuffs that are *usually* the most important will not be pushed down/away. But for example a Hunter's Mark can be fairly useless if you only bring a couple of them and it has a high priority.
---
Again, you'll find detailed lists with a search.
---
Sidenote: Also there is a *kind of* similar mechanic regarding HoTs. HoTs of the same type are not stackable on the same target. This can mean that your raid leader will assign a Druid to be allowed to use them while others can't or you discuss/determine this between healers.
---
There are a lot of stupid, obnoxious people that don't understand the processes theorycrafters go through to arrive at their results, yet they still mindlessly follow the results as if they understand.  These types potentially ruin the game for others, and so that's why I think they get conflated with theorycrafters.  Or is it vice-versa?  Either way works.
---
Also, theorycrafters aren't necessarily great gamers, so some people with an edge against them might say they're dumb when they really just mean they're not the best player of whatever given video game.  Related, some people can view theorycrafters as clinging to their numbers instead of what actually matters: how it plays out in the game itself.  So that could be called "dumb."
---
I didn't play in BFA so I don't know if it works, but back in Vanilla on PVE server hunters would kindly gather a dozen mob and FD at the feet of the bot.
---
On PVP servers we used the official forums to signal the bots we couldn't kill to the other faction.
---
There's a copypasta somewhere explaining that he's a high level fighter with a 20 INT.
---
WoW terms he's a Warrior/Mage/Priest Hybrid
---
I think Warriors will be even more popular, since it's so easy to find a group as tank and they're very good at all forms ov PvP.
---
Rogues will still be popular, but maybe not as much. A lot of people who played spellcasters thinking they'll play rogue might reconsider when they notice how much harder it is to lvl a rogue compared to warlock or mage :D 
---
Druids will be a lot more popular.
---
what?
---
99% sure physical fears are removed by bop because physical fears are prevented by lip.
---
That being said I don't think priest fear is physical- could be wrong tho.

The chinese farmers already used proxies back in Vanilla. The blanket IP ban only hinders honest players.

They added the darkmoon faire copy of this.

The main reason for the token is actually getting more money out of subs, retail can prove you it's not a definitive measure against gold selling/spamming.
---
Also keep in mind retail is their flagship, they have all the interests, from a business perspective, to encourage people to play retail, they do it with a shared sub and having to grind retail if you want to pay your sub with gold.
---
The token is unified per region, to have it on Classic they should implement a separated infrastructure for it, that's a huge cost with no return, since they have already their ROI on retail.
---
All this is very different from implementing loot trading to lessen the load of handling tickets, this is why I believe it doesn't make sense for them to add a token to Classic.
---
If they find other reasons I can't see and end up doing it, it wouldn't be a big problem for me, but I understand there may be people unsubbing over it.
---
Yay! I didn’t even consider this. Loved running 5x Shaman, my Orbital Drop Shock Troop..
---
The same diffrence between an PvE realm and PvP realm but with roleplaying.
---
I think i’m looking more forward to TBC then Classic tbh, and i’m very excited for Classic..
---
I don’t see why we would have Xrealm stuff whatsoever.
---
Fury MT was in Vanilla already a thing. It's not new to private servers with that macro. Get your information right. The Fury MT was in the old days around 30-40% higher in threat than the classic Prot Warrior 
---
Can't believe I was thinking of rolling on a PVE server
---
WHAT?
---
I am trying to get Shocks for my sham, has been a dream of mine. 
---
And Dots for the lock, simple and effective names
---
Inbefore someone says wow was released in 2004. In Europe it was released in February 2005, German language in chat being an obvious hint that this is European.
---
My character ended when I used three months of savings from a slow climb to level 54, for which I then purchased [Bloodrazor](https://classicdb.ch/?item=809) for my Warlock for 120g. Only to get laughed at everywhere I went, and I did not know why.
---
My first character was a orc warrior I quit on at lvl 52. I decided I enjoyed PvP too much so I rerolled on a PvP server when I got TBC and the hunter I made there has been my main ever since. My warrior is still sitting on Kargath server and scored me the Grunt title and some vintage vanilla transmogs.
---
I'm not even sure we reached the number of 25 gnome warriors at the peak of Vanilla :D
---
Yeah, it's the european beta before game launched on Feb. 11th 2005 here :)
---
Lol back before I started playing that was my impression too that everyone got a pet. I was going to be a badass orc warlock with a black wolf pet, dreams partially shattered.
---
I wonder if there will be old classic devs that will play when it gets released
---
A great honour to be the first corpse in Wetlands
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b58g7e/looking_for_group_monday_march_25_2019/
---
Still has to go back for the pet at level 10, so it's still a bad idea. 
---
Meaning you dont have any movement enhancing abillities outside of external sources. So like hunter has cheetah, mage has blink, druids have travel and catform speed and sprint. 
---
I played Classic back then, and yeah, I remember how Sunder and Expose Armor were like a "major" armor debuff, so they were exclusive but would stack with Faerie Fire because it was like a "minor" armor debuff.
---
In general, I think I correctly recall Curse of the Elements/Shadows never being overwritten as well as, like you said, Hunter's Mark.  That's why I thought maybe it's duration-based, but that's probably just coincidence.  So if Deep Wounds is low priority, then that means it never interferes with applying debuffs you want, right?  I remember some raid officers back then actually getting upset at Protection Warriors for speccing for Impale because they thought their Deep Wounds would be a problem, but I thought it just got overwritten.  So I was right all along?  Figures, and I even thought back then that the 16 debuffs thing was only a display issue.
---
I do also remember how you could only have one application of each HoT spell.  In fact, hah, I remember now when reading 2.0 patch notes that said you could now have any number of HoTs on a target at once, and I thought, "That'll be ridiculously overpowered, how could they balance that!  They would have to make things hit tanks super hard!" and then...well, I unintentionally ended up correctly predicting the future there, lol.
---
Anyway, I was just curious about the technical details of debuff overwriting because of the talk of Deep Wounds.  But you're right that if I care that much, I should just go searching one day.
---
Know that there's a hill near gnome that's clilbable that helps tremendously. Look it up. 
---
bruh those guys must be like 13 or something, their german is so bad lmao
---
Still doesn't stop the idiots at studios like EA blanket blocking everyone :)
---
Samanta not Samantha ? That bothers me for some odd reason and I’m not into RP
---
Legolas on a Dwarf Warrior. Don't realy want to play him but from time to time I will log in and start to dance between some roleplayers. Most likely I will rollplay on my own with my main. But Legolas the dancing dwarf will always be a  mysterious  force to be reckoned with. 
---
On PvE servers, you are allowed to have both factions simultaneously. On PvP, however, you’re not. 
---
Was pretty sure they just said 2019, never "early 2019". Which would imply later in the year than Classic as Classic got a "Summer 2019".
---
I think one of the benefits is that it can also suit your demands, as I remember it not being too hard to get into.
---
Maybe it's with any healer, but all I needed was to get some pre-raid bis items, and I was good to go. My healing was just that good. 
---
Now it would've been much better if I was the person I am now, and actually knew about consumables. Back then, I was pretty young and still thought selling a potion or scroll was better, because the effect of them were temporary xD
---
Now I'm actually prepared to use consumables, during levelling and PVE or PVP content.
---
I think it was basically a kill command -&gt; steady shot rotation that was specific to your weapons attack speed.  Basically had a lot of CDs(rapid fire, bw, trinkets, group buffs) that you incorporated into the DPS flow but the rotation was just one button.  Gave you a lot more time to focus on fight mechanics which hunters were really good at in that xpac.  I remember kael'thas our hunters were the reason we went from first attempt to first kill within I think 2-3 days and leap frogged from being weeks behind starting attempts to #1 on server and got a headstart on BT/Hyjal.
---
he's making an alliance guide atm. I doubt it will be as good as the horde guide but he knows what he's doing.  
---
[Joanas World](https://www.joanasworld.com/alliance-1-12-elwynn-forest.html)
---
I think this happens on every multiplayer game's subreddit haha.
---
Zomg that’s so true 
---
The shaman agi totem is pretty good for ferals. You’ll likely never see it, as rogues and warriors want windfury, but the extra agi is a decent boost. 
---
Oh, I guess the right one was already taken :D
---
2500, it's classic. 
---
My go-to last time I leveled a hunter was the following: Learn the cat Cower, enable Aspect of the Cheetah, kite and use Distracting Shot and Concussive Shot. The cat will basically kill him while you just need to do some circles around the mob.
---
&gt;what the media says about it.
---
Haha I like the way you put it.
---
I mean I said that my preferred timeframe is up to August and the workplace said they're okay with it. I'm still not sure if I'll remain there long term or find something else. My situation is kind of odd so it requires these sorts of things to happen.
---
Anyway, Classic is in my priority list so I'll be able to put in some serious hours into it once I'm fully free.
---
What does sharding have to do with it? If a server is overpopulated it's a queue even if the starting area are sharded.
---
They launched new servers because the population became full, not because the servers crashed.
---
Amen brother! I’ve been worried that no one would speak up about this and this is something I want to return!
---
Alternative view ... if you are healing in BGs troll is okay for increased cast speed but having an additional CC break is much more important.  Can't keep your team up if you are CCed no matter how fast you cast (not to mention a good chunk of what you cast is instant anyway dispel, renew, PWS, fear, etc).
---
For PvE ... keep in mind on certain fights like nef/ony most of your raid is going to get feared besides the MT/OT that are stance dancing ... if all the healers are feared who is healing?  The undead priests that are doing a wotf rotation so they can keep healing without being interrupted.  Sure tremor totem will break you out soon enough but I always liked having at least one healer still able to continue uninterrupted.
---
Nah pretty much the reason for me not to go back to rogue.
---
The preparation for the raid is insane. 
---
No, druid tanks don't generate more threat than warrior on horde side, because druids don't benefit from windfury. Another problem is that all the melee dps will have WF aswell.
---
Everything he said was true but the price is just way too expensive, that's why right now I'm trying order &amp;amp; chaos online.
---
Pretty sure we will be restricted as we did. It allows faction collusion too easy otherwise.
---
I'd have gone for Zämänta, the only real german version of Samantha!
---
Hey, i mentioned this in my megathread for feedback about the classic Demo
---
&gt; You can currently create Horde and Alliance on the same server. The possiblity to make horde/ally on PvP servers were added in [WotLK](https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=112617) (probably possible due to it being a demo and you can try different factions)
---
I never played in a PvE server so I didn't really remember what were the rules regarding those servers. 
---
I love the warrior's reaction when he two-shot melted that nelf priest or what was he. You can't really do much when your MS procs a 2k+ crit followed by an insane execute hit :D!
---
Awesome fight, got me real hyped, even though I cannot stand to watch trolls.
---
Me toooo :D Alliance vs Horde!!! I really think that restricting factions per server really did improve the atmosphere of war, and it made you root for your own faction so much more. 
---
Ive never played any private servers just the original so I’m chomping at the bit. I wasn’t able to accomplish a lot of the things I wanted to and only had 1 level 60 before BC came out. I look forward to going back and getting to finish things and do some things I never got the chance to do the first time around. 
---
Its obvious that this should NOT be possible. Harms the people in the server.
---
Well, collusion can still happen, since the way battle.net works you can send messages to everyone I suppose, and you also got discords, skype and stuff. Times have changed. But I still think that we should have restriction on faction per server
---
meh. It'll never topple Anarchy Online anyway.
---
I was also confused by that phrase...
---
It's just no one is talking about it, or very few people that is. I think it's due to the fact that many people played only on private servers without these restrictions, so maybe they aren't even aware of this restricion in vanilla wow
---
Good catch, mate. I was worried that I was the only one that remembered :P 
---
So do the dps though, with windfury as well. Not saying the 30% is exact either but not sure how windfury helps the tanks more than the dps. 
---
That website you linked is broken and gives me an unsafe warning
---
I'd like to know what their plans are after phase 6(naxx). I think they said on the panel if they got enough interest they might add new content, which would be cool, like WoW continuing on but in the vanilla style. I'd also like TBC servers. These announcements are probably years off though. I guess a more realistic one would be how long do they plan to go between phases.
---
Tauren hunter on a pvp server is questionable anyway. Doesn’t Taurens increased hitbox fuck up their deadzone in pvp?
---
Well, there's a skip near gnomeragan that makes it way faster. It doesn't require any wall climbing either. 
---
I kinda hope that you'll be able to make both factions on a PvP server. I always get such a stiffy when people log on Horde toons to bitch at me after a successful gank.
---
Looking for a US alliance server that will raid on weekends. Anyone out there?
---
never hearth 1-10?
---
That one was really bad =(
---
Donaldtrump will be first char I create as my bank 
---
I don't have the time to invest in two characters (well, a minor banking char will do), even more so if they are in different factions, so I absolutely care not about it, as probably a lot of people who follow the same thoughts. Well, transfering between factions early in game may be more or less convenient depending on that.
---
One thing I'd really hate with no restriction would be cross-faction scouting. All your enemies can keep tabs on which zones you're in and harrass you. People even go to the lengths of inviting people to group to get their exact location and then going to kill/camp them. Seems like a bad idea across the board.
---
Or just be a fair and decent human being and not cheat? I hope you get banned before the game even launches, and from this reddit.
---
shit lol, someone shared it on this sub and I bookmarked it....
---
Everybody is here to tell you when a farming spot sucks but when you ask for good spots everyone vanishes.
---
This is so hush-hush god damn.
---
What is your reasoning behind raiding on Monday and Tuesday?  Your guild concept sounds great, and I'd be seriously interested in joining, but I'm put off by the raid days as they don't suit me personally. Normally you see a two-day guild with one mid-week and one weekend raid. How come you've decided on this and is it set in stone?
---
I certainly hope there will be no beta. It is going to kill the hype. I mean, with this level of hype, a beta would be the actual launch, but obly for a select elite of nolifers content creators and streamers. 
---
It's the same client, you can switch the language in the battle net launcher. First time you switch it'll download the additional language, but after that you can switch whenever you like.
---
Nature resist gear and potion
---
Libram of protection/focus because they can be changed into a nr enchant in zg
---
if you want to be a competent healer and enjoy it, make sure to remember this:
---
Avoiding Damage is always better than Healing it.
---
Make this your mantra. Beat up your group members until they understand this mantra too. 
---
That would be the perfect and easy solution.
---
Let's hope it works in classic!
---
Wasn't King Bangalash in STV the only pet who could learn Cobra reflexes, I remember there being a time when he was THE pet to get, before Ravagers and their Gore ability was all the rage.
---
I used to hit the arena whenever I could with my shaman, and my mate also on his shaman. One of the best memories I have of the shaman was the arena, contested by us, the servers first (and at the time only) rank 14 shaman with his hunter friend, and an alliance warlock + paladin duo. The warlock dropped infernal on us and it later broke lose and went crazy running around. Everyone was popping ankhs, soul stone and running back. I don’t remember who got the chest, just remember it was crazy
---
For raiding, I'd recommend binding your mousewheel to shadowbolt. Put lifetap somewhere convenient &amp; you can click the rest without any loss.
---
Oh I changed my mind follow that guide with perfection  O_O..
---
Hush hush *x-files music*
---
I am totally with you. Only saw vanilla up to the first half of bwl, so i am excited for the rest! 
---
Also never played heal in Vanilla, so let‘s see :)
---
&gt;. But I know that, in Vanilla.. it was a 
---
Pallys unite!
---
I think buffing will be far less of a requirement in classic. Iirc the way they work in pservers is hugely different from vanilla. Ony's head had a much longer cool down before you could hand it in, same with black lotus spawns. Flasks will be way too expensive to use reliably in raids
---
I've been considering the same. The general consensus seems to be that it will be based on 7.3 or whatever, but no-one is sure.
---
My best bet, would be to learn how to write lua for retail wow, and then backport.
---
Getting corpse-camped by NinjaLordXX is antithetical to a dedicated RP server. What exactly is the RP justification behind being murdered, and then running back to your corpse from the spirit healer?
---
I don’t think any class benefits as nuch from shamans as they do from paladins, though. 
---
Uh, no one ever does that in vanilla
---
There were no oceanic realms at launch either. 
---
Horde 2h-fury warriors perhaps. But the rest, yea I agree. Paladins will be better in 9 times out of 10. It's the main reason Alliance PvE is easier.
---
The authentic vanilla experience is only 1 faction per server. It would be absurd for Blizzard to remove it. Its safe to say it will stay. 
---
I've been in the same boat, I want to build and have some stuff down in the live client, which is what I think it'll follow. 
---
The problem I see is how they're going to restrict it. They've said they will so I don't want to build something and find out chunks/all of it wont work.
---
My impression - undead is the pick for you. It's close and you can't really go wrong however you roll, but that's what I'm reading
---
Most people who roll on any kind of RP server do so because they want to be immersed in the world - not being able to fight the faction you're supposedly at war with heavily detracts from said immersion.
---
Furthermore RP-PVP opens up a lot more opportunities for cross-faction RP.
---
Its not that ret is bad in pvp (it is good if played properly), its just that holy is really overpowered in group pvp
---
Barrens. Barrens is where I spended 80% of my vanilla time because I never knew what I wanted to main and made like 20 character to around 20 and deleted then because I didn't liked the name, race/class combo or hair color.
---
3. Running around leaving scars...
---
Just don't forget to take FP along the way. The icing is when you hearthstone without having bound. Happened to me more often than I'd like to admit. And you're good for a second long and perilous journey. 
---
Got a source for that?
---
latency was a real issue back then
---
Maraudon without herbalism sucks, it's only 28 gold per hour for tinkerer and princess, based on average value of the drop tables multiplied by maximum instance resets per hour).
---
The average value of DM:T drop table is 25g, if you can do 5 per hour that's 125g on average. If you're saving up gold farmed from maraudon that gold will quickly lose a ton of value once DM hits. You're better off farming stuff of value (herbs) and saving them for the DM:T gold inflation.
---
He will learn english fast from playing on an englisch server. Gaming is what tought me english.
---
Teach himto copy paste quests in thottbot and he will be fine 
---
I'm not sure if you can have 2 languages. 
---
&gt;(can't use AC ALL the time)
---
Like fuc you can't.... That's a logical leap of I've ever seen one.
---
Of the last year of my life I'd wager I've spent less than 24 hours not in AC. That's about 24 hours too many.
---
Getting corpse camped is not antithetical to an **RP-PVP** server though, is it? Those servers have both. That's why a small group of people are miffed - they want the wPVP experience and to be able to find a good dedicated roleplaying community on the same server. You're not in character 100% of the time (some crazy folks will try), you don't have to try and slot NinjaLordXX into your character's narrative. 
---
Atleast we dont have to deal with the salt of level 1 chars wispering you that you are a dickhead for camping them...
---
On the other hand.. Its funny to read how mad people can get.
---
I really hope its restricted to single fations. I liked having a server for each. I also liked feeling like I was part of a real faction on each server.
---
My last point is that Classic imo should be as close as it can be to 2004/5. If it was that way then, It should be that way now. Regardless of weather its bad/good design or weather we like it or not.
---
i think that rp-pvp servers unfortunately doesn't come to classic 
---
For the first few weeks for sure! 
---
Almost every "popular" Streamer on Twitch did play wow on some point in his life.
---
As mentioned before classic allows a lot more "chat interaction" because you have to make so many stops to eat/drink etc. 
---
I think it's logical that they'd eventually add a fresh server, and I think people will be asking for one too. Despite what people here are saying, people will get bored after the games been sitting on the final patch for months and most of the pop is in raid log mode.
---
Well, in Tolkien lore the term "wizard" is just people of middle earth call the Istari, whom are five special spirits linked to certain Valar. Since the Valar are the entities that shaped the world they are basically Tolkien lores version of gods.
---
With that in mind, the Tolkien wizards got their powers directly from the gods and are followers and acting hands of the gods. As such they are more relatable to priests than mages.
---
Even then, isn’t might/kings more dps than windfury/SoE? It’s less flashy, for sure. 
---
Yea. I put in another thread a few days ago that server pairing would be the best solution. That way you can still get to know all the names you're facing. Plus you only pair up opposite type realms (ie 2 low pop realms, 1 with Horde imbalance, one with Alliance)
---
Playing on private server in a high end guild. Flasks are NOT required. Some people that want to do some dps meter racing use them, far majority doesnt. I dont, since a pally doesnt really benefit a lot from any of them.
---
I’ve heard that you could during beta - but I wouldn’t be sure. 
---
I love this. I still know it by heart.
---
I'm planning to make do with the felsteed until the dreadsteed quest becomes available. I still hope the parts that don't need Dire Maul will be available earlier so you can do them ahead of DM's release, but realistically I don't think that's going to happen.
---
Macros are gonna run like they do right now, no sequence and stuff that existed back then.
---
Literally just /cast Blind. Can't remember how it used to be back then, but IIRC it was something like "Get SpellID"5555"", So it will be a lot easier. :)
---
Regarding addons they'll be written in LUA, if you create an addon that works on retail, it will most likely work on Classic aswell, as long as you change the gameversion in the addon.
---
Gz on cakeday. Lets see blizzard talking about wow tokens. That should stir the hornets nest quite a bit.
---
Except the content release plan. And some itemisation. And loot trading. So it's already not flat 1.12 as is. Things can change
---
You won't be seeing a lot of world buff stacking or max consumables either. The cooldowns on the turn ins prohibit raids from having reliable access to it and the fact that herbs spawn A LOT slower in vanilla than on private servers mean you won't have every raider with two backpacks full of elixirs, potions and flasks. Hell, black lotus alone only has 672 spawns per week in vanilla (minus 4 spawns for every hour the servers are down). It spawns once per hour in 4 zones. If I remember right all other nodes (herb/ore) are on a 30min timer (as opposed to the 6ish minutes on private servers) so there simply won't be enough herbs in the world to expect every raider to have max consumables especially when everything but flasks goes away whenever you die
---
We are over 250 signatures now! Keep fighting the good fight!
---
I mean horde got xroads quest up to lvl 25. And they have their starting zones right beside it up to lvl 10. So half of your levels come from the same place basically.
---
Well, now I am really conflicted. The third point is somewhat countered by the night elves getting a bit more avoidance. Fourth isn't that important, I don't think I will face any difficulties in 5mans.
---
The other points are hard to refute. Thanks for the answer!
---
iirc private server cat druid dps is not representative because stuff like weightstones etc works on cats when it should not
---
We're hopeful; the blizzard forums have multiple threads about it, there's a petition going. We're not sitting idle until we, and many others, do get one per region. The interest is sufficiently high enough if you look at the census (almost 4x more than RP-PvE!).
---
Elwynn Forest. Because of the South Park episode where I was first introduced to WoW. 
---
Yea I agree the community is split on it. To some, the idea of warring against the opposite faction on your server is the be all and end all of PvP. Others, like yourself just want quick queues.
---
Simple solution. Offer both options. Some realms could be marked from the start as not being included in any Xrealm stuff. Roll on them at your own risk
---
If you are sitting you will get crit, it's not some made up feature. 
---
Winterspring. This is where my final push to 60 took place, not only that but all the white snow is hard to forget. 
---
Tirisfal Glades and Silverpine Forest because I've leveled a few undead and Undericty was my home. 
---
Don't give him the German version man! I couldn't speak English for the life of me and after a year and a half of WoW I was the best in class.
---
If you want impale you're going to loose the 5% free crit that you get at the bottom of the fury tree. Is it really worth it ?
---
1Kneedles, and finally getting the old version of it back. Its the only zone Cata completely ruined for me
---
I am torn apart between Undead Priest and Undead Rogue. I look at guides for both classes all the time, leveling, gearing, etc. 
---
They just both seem really cool and it's very difficult for me to decide. I like healing but I like dps as well and having glowing swords/daggers is really appealing to me. I just can't decide, the more I read the more it balances out.
---
 I intend to do pve mostly. One seond I think "Fuck it, I am rolling priest", two seconds later "But rogues are so cool and I would love to play them", it goes on and on... Any advice will be greately appreciated. Thank you.
---
&gt; This seems no different from what it has always been like on private servers
---
But we aren't getting private server this time
---
Want to main warlock, afraid that I'll be a sitting duck against rogues and warriors. Convince me fel brothers
---
Eman. It told me to type name, but it didnt say which way.
---
Dude, we cant help you with this. You are on your own. I kind of have the same between dwarf priest and humand warrior. Good luck. You will pick eventually.
---
10/10
---
You have a problem reading &amp; understanding English or something? 
---
*READ WHAT I SAID*
---
I love every comment here, it gives me home :) thanks guys!
---
Except it's not. They went and renamed some of my old characters without notifying me. 
---
2 weeks after DM he  will not be  able to be  10 levels above me, if You know what I mean.
---
You can get both wf totem puts a 9 sec buff I think (might have been 8 sec) during that time you can have agility totem down
---
Personally I'd recommend not telling him there's a German version. Tons of people, me included, learned English to a much higher standard  than most schools teach it by playing video games, and I think your son would be better off in the long run if you just drop him into it.
---
No they didn’t. Your account was inactive for a long time, your names went up for grabs. Your account got hacked and they picked new names after your old names were taken. They didn’t rename them themselves. 
---
What on eearth are you talking abiut. The topic has been covered more times than I can count. 
---
Yeah, I had that on a few fights. More common was twisting tranquil air with WF, cos I didn’t raid with a big dick threat main tank 
---
I agree, I was around 11 when the Pokémon games came out, and I went from zero to hero real fast because there was no way to get by without knowing some English. He'll pick it up super fast, kids that age are goddamn knowledge sponges, especially when they're having fun :p
---
&gt;But what is going to keep people playing?  If I grind and grind and get through Naxx, what is gonna keep me logging on?
---
Why would a new server change that? If you want to start again create a new character.
---
I can't believe that this was so long ago.
---
IIRC heroic strike was an instant in TBC instead of being next swing in Vanilla so I don't think you can compare them accurately.

I learned english myself playing games on a Commodore 64 and Amiga 500 before I even had english classes in school. Those quest texts are super long though and without a quest addon it really is hard for him to figure out what to do.
---
Clap is on a 1 minute cooldown, screech is a lot shorter than that. It generates like 4x more TPS.
---
I laugh so hard now when I see myself fumble with how the interactions worked in this game.  
---
I played a few MMO's  before (Mostly DAOC since 2001).  
---
As a European I played on US servers when It launched in 2004 and got 2 chars up to 40 and then stopped to "save" the experience for when the European servers launched in the start of 2005.  
---
We demand unbiased and liberated journalism on our class!
---
Of course, even though they don't make much difference nowadays. Back in 2005 there was no Twitter, Discord and crap like that. Unless you can half your Server in MSN there was no way to easily communicate in Private with the Horde.
---
Given how well WF scales with slow 2h weapons I'm not sure, but again BoK/BoM/Salv may still be better.
---
The fact that my name can be up for grabs due to inactivity is the opposite of my character always being there. 
---
&gt; he is able to do up to 2x more threat with his fury build. 
---
That is false information.
---
Solid testing on private servers (yeah, the ones that FAVOR Fury tank meta) show that the differences, in Threat, between a Fury and Prot Warriors are between 10% and 30% (higher with world buffs, lower w/o world buffs).
---
In Classic, world buffs will be on CD, so any wipe (or MT death) during progression will make Fury tanks totally undesirable for MT-ing during progression.
---
The MT in your guild sucks as a tank. If he can pull twice the threat (assuming you aren't lying) in Fury, he clearly sucks as Prot.
---
Anyway, the conditions for MT raids in Classic as Fury are outside 99% of the content. First, your entire raid will have to use flasks and world buffs. Secondly, the raid must be on speed farming status. And thirdly, the entire raid will have to be top hardcore players.
---
You can use a Fury tank, safely, in BWL and bellow, if you guild is farming Naxx.
---
Anything except that, and the tanks will be Prot Warriors. Maybe some Bears for some guilds for some bosses.
---
Dude it’s a name, your character is still there. It’s like you stubbed your toe and cries like it has been cut off.

I've been playing Lineage II with my father, when a friend of his gave us a Wow account while he was on a vacation. I was around 11-12 y.o. At first glance it looked awful compared to l2 so I played for a few days and went back grinding Eyes somewhere near Dion town.  Can't remember what I played first rly.   
---
But when my father got his own copy of wow, I was impressed by the trailer, decided to play druid-cat and ended up around 15-17, when I rolled another char.   
---
We've been playing on Neptulon first, Alliance side, trying to find as many fellow Russian players as we can and formed a Russian-mafia guild. When I realised there is a Warsong filled with Russians I went there and leveled a Paladin somewhere around 40-50 level. Unfortunately, when Blizz released official Ru-servers somewhere around TBC - we left our characters on EU and started from the scratch again 
---
Does anyone know how long classic WoW will last? 2 years or 3 years?
---
How long will each content phase be??
---
What he doesn't tell you however, is that bears still do more threat than warriors. And since threat is more of an issue horde side, it's not as clear cut at all. 
---
HS was definitely not instant in TBC
---
"Incorrect armor values" - pservers have higher armor values than retail vanilla. And still armor affects threat too, with lower armor in classic tanks will have more threat to compensate the increased physical dps. 
---
If dps has dragonslayer buff, so will the tank, so the increased dps is compensated with additional threat.
---
No. A well geared warrior can do some very nasty things. Charge / Intercept + intimidating shout + recklessness, they can take out multiple people much more easily than other classes. Add in consumables, trinkets, etc - 
---
Thansk for the reply. yes I will eventually and so do you, it's just so hard. Having a release date will help alot haha 
---
Yeah these guys are comparing relative strength of tanks. And sure, ally bear do more relative threat compared to their ally dps counterpart. But it's less needed. Since horde bear still do much more threat than horde warriors, and horde threat is much more of an issue than ally threat, horde bears are just as important. 
---
I feel you brother!
---
My mind is going in circles too. I mained a priest back in the day and really loved it. Now do I want to change it up or go for the "same" experience again?
---
Warrior is my second choice but I'm a bit afraid that due to time constraints I won't be able to MT raids being the OT isn't too appealing.
---
One point that is really important to me is that I want to play a class that actually wears the Tier gear. Priest (heal) and warrior (tank) both wear their sets so that's a big plus.
---
Gonna have to roll both I guess...
---
Anyone knows if camping out of Maraudon will even be possible? If not thats a hard nerf to that method. 
---
&gt; I am 99% certain that no one has talked or posted about this 
---
Because there was no point.
---
You can't roll both factions on same realm.
---
Period.
---
##1.0 forever!
---
Strange, I could swear that I've created my account in nov 2004 but when I started playing it was around patch 1.7 or something. Though it could be me not having enough funds to actually play the game xD as a kid it was hard to pay for the subscription.
---
Yeah, on private servers this is the main thing i noticed. A fuckton of more healers compared to vanilla.
---
Well, would you want them to encourage it instead?
---
If they force you to do it outside of the game, that already puts of a few people. 
---
If they don't force you to do it outside of the game, then it encourages much more people to do it.
---
I'm not too knowledgeable on this though, so this is just my blunt thinking.
---
I dont think buffs are going to be any different. Its just going to be bit pain in the ass to get them. And you might plan getting the buffs 1-3 days early and not just buff as you go (like on private servers). Get a timer on example ony buff. Login to get the buff and logout until the raid with the buffs.
---
Even if the flasks cost more, high end guilds will buy them.
---
Well if your SL with VW you make them hate their life.
---
Totems dont boost feral dps, paladins do. 
---
Can you describe in a few words please what was like being a priest at 60? I know I can google, just hearing from someone else will help.
---
I hope you pcik the right class then :)
---
Was your name "Voleurman" by any chance ? 
---
I was playing a warrior in Deadmines when a rogue rolled need and won the mace.
---
I called him a ninja and kicked him out of the group. The guy was so mad that he threatened to come raid my home with his Police colleagues, I still have the screenshots of this conversation. Good times :D
---
At level 60 if you take 1000 damage and get 32 rage then that server has correct rage generation from damage.

Also, there are far more accurate private servers than nostalrius was. So if something is off on nostalrius doesn't mean it's off in all pservers since they are constantly individually patched as people find better sources for how things worked.
---
Needs Nu-Metal.
---
Only thing I can say is take a realistic look at how much time you plan on spending and how much difficulty you are willing to put up with.
---
It will be very easy to find a group as a healer, and getting a raid spot won't be tough either.
---
Finding a group as an rogue is tough, and a raid spot tougher and spriest has it tougher still.
---
&gt; Yes. However original vanilla wow was only capped by hardware limitations 
---
Except it wasn't. Vanilla pop cap was by design. Do your research.
---
All of the starting zones really. I feel like the process of making a character and being in these zones has bigger impact, because of the game's old rpg essence; it feels like you're beginning a journey.
---
The quests remind me of older rpgs too; where you're not a revered hero, you're a wondering person, most likely a newbie. 
---
I remember in a few old rpgs, maybe Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, you are really seen as trash or fresh meat when you start the game. You're the new guy with nothing to your name. But on the other hand, you get to choose what kind of person you want to be. Do you want to be a killer, or a savior? A thief, or a protector? 
---
In times like that, I remember the first zone really well. You look back at the end and remember it's the place it all started, and you miss it. Kind of like in real life where you can miss being a kid, but at the same time you appreciate how you've developed (hopefully).
---
Can I ask: what do you mean stock up on leather? Stockpile Heavy, wait for inflation and then sell when the price goes up?
---
I thought the general recommendation for skinning was to vendor stacks while levelling, oay for mounts, then switch to a crafting at 60?
---
I might get Quest History add-on to track quests I did not finish in a given zone.
---
remind me again what the character limit is?  something tells me 11 is the max.  it's a shame... i'd love a male dwarf bank alt named yaryarhumphump
---
seriously though... i have a notepad on my desk that has been collecting potential character names since the original vanilla announcement in 2017...  it's up to about 50 potentials, with 2-3 frontrunners for each class
---
&gt; The developers like to keep parity between versions.

I watch "classic" streamers every week. Just to see how other guilds are doing in raids, what they do differently etc. And sometimes watching a raid is fun, because you have already cleared everything. Especially when others fail. :P
---
Classic is using the [modern client](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic) (7.3.5 or 8.1.x) so addons will be using a subset of the latest lua api, and macros the same. The only thing you need to worry about is that some API features like castbars and focus that didn't exist in vanilla is probably gonna get disabled. You also have to account for that certain UI elements are revamped such as the talent frame. Some data arguments might also be changed like spell ranks.
---
For learning lua, check out wowinterface.com and wowpedia. Also keep in mind, wow uses Lua 5.1, not 5.2+.
---
These miniscule changes in the game world will make classic so much better than private servers. On pservers this hill is just a lifeless clump of dirt with a random fire elemental spawning. 
---
In retail vanilla these little fire elementals are roaming about just adding flavor to the game.
---
Can't wait to enter a true iteration of vanilla WoW in summer &lt;3

I was being sarcastic. A solo warrior will always loose a 1v3 unless he's grey killing.

Warrior is the most gear **and** group dependent in Vanilla. Prove me otherwise.

Hi, /u/Ringsfjord
---
Interesting question.
---
I hope they give us some estimation on the time span between phase 1 and 2. If it's more than 3 months, then I'll likely buy the regular epic mount. Thing is, I expect to hit lvl 60 in 2 months maximum. I imagine I could live without epic mount for 1 month but not more than that.
---
I think it comes down to the length of phase 1 and your lvling speed. Unfortunately I dislike regular horses so as a human warlock I'll have to decide on lvling in night elf zones (which is painful without warlock trainers).
---
Cheers! That's some good info!  Thank you
---
no private server discussions on this subreddit

I can't decide between Warlock or Mage. I've always been playing Warlock and I love the class because of all the utility it brings to the table, but I'm afraid I wont have too much time to farm shards and so on before every raid, also I'm afraid that raiding will be spamming shadow bolts and the CoE/Corruption every now and then. 
---
So I've been thinking about playing mage since it shares a lot of similarities with lock (Only dps class, caster, mana and so on), but do you guys think I will grow tired of playing Mage since they, as far as I know, also only spams frostbolts and, compared to Warlocks, lack utility. 
---
Also, since I wont be able to play as much as I want to and wanting to play a class that doesn't require that much farming and the like, which of the two classes would be the better one? 
---
Deadmines in vanilla was called VC because Dire Maul was relevant endgame content so as to not confuse people you were trying to recruit in trade chat 
---
German Server, but nobody was able to speak the German Language in the Chat... Nice...
---
For every thread like yours they should just add something from retail. These are getting annoying tbh.
---
Good rogue farming advice pre-DM?
---
lets use a BEST case scenario and do some math.
---
6 days played to level a farming alt who can farm 50g/hour.
---
1000 gold to get the farming character an epic mount.
---
your main (who is shit at farming) makes 30g/hour
---
Basically you start making a "profit" from having a farming character after a certain period of time.
---
6 days played = 144 hours
---
144 hours * main gold/hour
---
144 * 30 = 4320g opportunity cost
---
= 5320g opportunity cost incl mount
---
so, you have invested 5320g (opportunity cost) to get a character that can farm 20g/hour higher than your main
---
5320/20 = 266hours = 11days played
---
so after you have farmed a total of  266 hours, or 11 days played, you are "making profit" from having a farming alt.
---
unless you want to play multiple classes, its probably not worth leveling an alt JUST for farming.
---
It’s considerably faster to sprinkle in some darkshore and loch modan unless you feel like grinding up a couple levels to be on par for westfall. You’re better off heading to darkshore for a bit before going straight to westfall
---
Basically a pvp server no cucklordx/ roxxorz/ thegodx names around 
---
There's a spot you can drown yourself in wetlands to wind up in Dun Morough. No idea if it'll work in classic but given the massive timesave I think it'd be worth looking up and trying. From there, go to IF and take the tram!
---
I loved speedrunning, been planning for release the last couple of years and practising - wrote the guide and busy refining it, and planning to smash out a top 5 server 60 at launch.  
---
After that, probably spend my time entertaining lowbies.
---
Biggest concerns as of now seem to be:
---
a) right click reporting
---
b) sharding
---
If classic really takes off some people are afraid that Acticvision might get greedy and add some kind of shop to classix (let's hope not).
---
The problem with right-click reporting is the potential of abuse. Like Loot Trading, before Kaivax blue post. In Retail, people DON'T TALK, hence, there is no reason to report someone. If the system is not not abused in Retail, which is a COMPLETELY diferent game, it doesn't mean it won't be abused in Classic.
---
In Retail, Loot Trading is not abused...because there is no point.
---
These 2 systems, Loot Trading and Right-Click report, while abusable, are not abused in Retail...because PEOPLE DON'T TALK and gear is IRRELEVANT.
---
&gt; And no, getting muted for saying something racist doesn't count as "bad." 
---
I can give you a shitload of examples of non-racist words that will absolutely trigger people. Point is, in Classic, people TALK, A LOT, and MOST OF THE TIME, they talk about OUTSIDE GAME topics, and because have different opinions, people, in general, are upset (especially in this day and age) if ANYONE is having a different opinion that theirs.
---
Right-Click reporting will be abused to hell and back in Classic. And if it makes it in game, it will probably be removed shortly after...once the forums will EXPLODE of example of people being squelched because they were farming in an area that they "shouldn't", or because they were grinding ranks, or because a concurrent guild wanted to a guild's MT squelched in a raid.
---

Life without a full set of netherweave bags...tough times!

Think you understood it wrong lol. He is asking about 1v3, not 3 1v1's.
---
Barrens/STM/Ashenvale is kickass for horde. Also they don't suffer as badly in the 45-50 section.
---
WR times on private servers are still Alliance right now though technically, so it's hard to say which is better.
---
From a realistic standpoint though leveling and dungeons are a tiny fraction of the time for most people. Yeah it takes 10 days or so to hit 60, and probably another 10 days to get good enough gear to step into raids, but then your gonna spend potentially the rest of the time you play the game doing raids, pvp, and farming. So its difficult to say that leveling or dungeons have anywhere near the weight the other 3 criteria should have.

We are a newly created German based guild for classic PVE progression.

Because we are a German based guild you should understand the language on a basic level. We expect all of our members to be respectful of all guild members. We don't expect everyone to know strategies to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, and put 100% effort into it.

You need to grind rep in retail to unlock classic

You can totally do this no problem, but you will need to go back to Teldrassil at level 10 for your hunter quests to get a pet, if you do hunter. I think you guys will have a great time!
---
Dont make the process of buying gold legit. I want people buying it to go on chinese website, put their paypal account and wow account at risk AND risk getting ban if they get caught.
---
And they will eventually. I want them to feel they put their character at risk.
---
I know how to level well enough that I might reference a guide to make sure I won't miss easy quests and just take it on myself outside of that. Questie addons are a bad idea to follow religiously when everyone else is doing the same, and that's when it pays off bigtime to improvise!

---
I wanna go mage but am not 100% fan of the available races. My favourites are Tauren, Orc and Dwarf. 
---
Overall I probably like alliance more than Horde, at least for Mage. Feels quite comfy, civilized etc. I do prefer horde early zones though and how their hubs are organized through the world and Shamans seem more annoying than Paladins to face. 
---
As for races, I like human as the armour fits well, the casting animations are good. But dont really like any facial animations or hair options, and their racials aren't my favourite. 
---
Gnomes are novel, I also like their animations and like their racials. But I'm worried that the novelty would wear off at some point, and that I'll regret picking a short dude.
---
Undead look cool, have cool animations and I like their racials. But I'm not in love with undead as a faction, they feel quite divorced from the horde and seem a bit 'evil'. Plus seems quite popular and likely overplayed.

Struggling between Hunter/Priest.
---
I intend to raid but also want to world PvP a lot. 
---
Hunter seems nice for that but I don't want to get into a situation whereby i can't get a spot because of too many hunters. Also don't like the idea of my DPS going down in further raid patches.
---
Likewise, priests, I'll get a spot but the constant switching between holy to pve and shadow to PvP with bugs me. 
---
Do you think for solo world PvP I'd be better with hunter or priest ? 
---
I definitely want to go alliance.
---
Can't argue with that. Fair point. 
---
This is amazing for a lot of reasons
---
I suspect /sit will cause you to be critted. It may not proc Enrage, though.
---
Fel brother here! Play orc lock for the 25% stun resist, really helps against rogues and warriors. Fear and Death Coil at the right time is devastating for melee attackers. Dot him up and kite with Imp. Curse of Exhaustion if warrior uses Berserker Rage (dispels Fear) and try to stay away until it runs out, then cast Fear again. Against melee, use VW if you can for the Sacrifice shield, it might save your ass. That's what I'll do, at least.
---
***Remember that Vanilla is rock, paper, scissors.*** Some classes beat other classes, there's no escaping that. Getting familiair with your spells, abilities and ofcourse using Engineering trinkets, stun nades etc. can really help you come out on top in fights.
---
Personally I don’t dislike the spammy rotations and tbh all classes have simple rotations you can’t escape it. But spammy rotations lets you multitask irl ;) the fun in vanilla comes from the social/rp/gearing and connection to your character rather than rotation!
---
If you’re into pvp at all what class would you like to defend yourself as when you get ganked on your way to the raid?
---
Also as lock you’ll have to get lots of shards yes! But as mage people will want water and portals too!
---
A big difference to consider is do you prefer pet classes or not?
---
Agreed! I do think some of the "freedom" was not knowing better, but there was always a lot of play in choosing your spec and gear for each fight.
---
And yeah, fury could be good, but unless you're heavy DPS gear I'd be a bit surprised. It seems like a great off-tank spec so you can do some damage when you're not tanking, but I expect heavy prot to be the highest threat.
---
Also, you really don't need to min-max that far for most stuff. I don't remember when I went protection, but I tanked a lot of stuff (at the least all of MC and Onyxia, maybe even BWL as straight up 31/20 PvP spec without much difficulty. Protection will be better, but it probably won't matter until AQ.
---
This restriction does not make much sense in 2019. 
---
With battle.net integration and the means of communication available now there is nothing what could stop you from cross faction collusion anyways. Moreover, you can always buy a second account. So if blizzard decides that they want to milk an extra bit of cash then we will have it.

Same here. Bought the game on release week. Didn't play for 2-3 months until I discovered some classmates in school played it too. That's when the addiction started.

LOL love this
---
He’s correct in everything he said. Even if mmorpg isn’t your genre, WoW is the greatest game ever made.
---
Hardwire pneumatics to your keyboard with a separate Raspberry PI controller to handle your rotation.
---
The whole classic playerbase will be a micro transaction, none of us have subbed for years.
---
That seems unlikely unless you have a source on Blizzard cutting castsequence, mouseover, and conditionals out of macros.  The thing with those macros is you could program them in to Vanilla WoW with an addon, so having them included isn't much of a deal breaker as far as authenticity.  
---
If they're going to cut out castsequence and the like, they should REALLY open the API back up, which would technically make the game even more convenient because then you can write scripts checking party HP and status to smart heal from one button, or prioritize what spells you cast on the enemy based on how many combo points you have on them or whatever cast sequence you scripted out anyway.

warlock lv40 is free and the lv60 still costs materials and some raw gold but with around 500g u ill be done maybe less if someone else can do the summoning for u
---
meaning farming the extra 100g a week for respecs
---
I'm kinda hoping 4 months per phase, makes it a 2 year adventure.
---
It also gets unhappy when you un summon him, so you have to check how long you will not need him to know if it's worth it. 
---
Nope, no info on that yet. several months per phase, id guess 4-6. But if the blue posts keep on coming with the same frequency as lately, we'll know soon enough
---
The most unintuitive thing about hunters that you'll never know yourself, if you just play the game, is that your pet learns abilities from other pets. One pet is not enough. and not only just abilities, but higher ranks of the same ability. 
---
So it doesn't work like that, that you tame one pet, let say a cat that you like and only want to use him, and doesnt touch other pets. In order progress your main pet, you need to stable it and go tame other pet to learn ability for your main pet by doing it.  and you need to know what to tame and what aiblities other pets have that will benefit your main pet.
---
thats compeletely unintutive and some ppl literally never know it, and, for instance, never know there is a higher rank of some ability even exists for their pet. when it does you need to learn it for your pet from other pet.
---
Also while leveling buy white slow bows from bow vendors they are the best accessible weapons for certained levels.
---
cant you play both
---
obviously pick 1 for a while but later slowly bring up the other one
---
I'm working on an excel sheet that lists all the leveling quests so at any given point you can see what quests are available in other zones and you can filter by zone/class/profession/faction/level range.  That way I don't get caught by any of the obtuse quest chains that start on the other side of the world but have a ton of quests and open up half a zone or something.
---
STV,  my favourite zone by far. 
---
On PvP servers you can't make a faction alt. On pve servers you can. 
---
&gt; and a raid spot tougher 
---
there are plenty of raid spots for rogues cuz they are the 2nd best dps in the game
---
AFAIK, most people are identifiable by their avatars name, not their battlenet name. 
---
Oh my, I actually missed that. Apologies! 
---
Actually announce Classic wow release date and let us go crazy trying to figure out if legit or not.
---
They do fall off at end game because the pets don't scale with gear/stats. They are taken to raids for their utility more than damage (Tranq shot etc). In Vanilla, the best hunters are the ones that utilize their utility both in PVP and PvE. Its one of the reason the skill gap is so big for hunters. Its easy to level, but hard to master.
---
Ayy i rerolled horde on burning blade at the start of bc
---
&gt;Copper and Silver - I miss money being a relevant aspect of the game. The feeling of earning a few silver so that you can get a 6 slot bag or afford training. 
---
finding some silver ore will feel like hitting the jackpot
---
I can see silver ore being worth a few gold each after the first couple of weeks when the first wave of 60s are powerleveling the proffs
---
I just wish they enforce this. 
---
There’s so many people not choosing classes just because it will be overpopulated, I think a lot might think like this and could sway it a little. Will probably be balanced out by new/casual players hearing X class is the best so they roll it though aha 
---
The rogue Buddhist has a PvP video in TBC where he duels people with only /cast commands.
---
It’s not completely set in stone, but we’re definitely not raiding during the weekends. We’d like to keep the weekends for family or other things.
---
WF doesn't improve caster or Hunter dps, and shaman have Tranquil air totem
---
ohhh... ur evil!
---
.
---
I like you
---
That is neither a good use of time nor a method of leveling to 15. But again, people can do what they want — you only get one Classic launch like this one, enjoy it.
---
I am afraid I cannot commit to two character, but that is a valid tip and I will have it consideration.
---
I had alternate keybinds for the important stuff even back then.
---
Like alt-v for vanish, shift-w for kick, etc.  They just showed the first keybind and I had what I really use bound as second.   
---
I remember watching a mythic raider doing the first boss of ToS with only chat commands
---
Don't take it for granted. Many people don't even remember that this used to eblmbe the case. Better safe than sorry 
---
I want the slow dungeon crawl back, dungeons now are basically like you doing a speed run.
---
be mind controlled by a shadow priest and doing spells
---
mages are the best class lol, ritual of refreshments is greatest spell of all time
---
Announcing planned near-future expansion line-up progressing from Classic onwards. So, completely new expansions that diverge from how TBC/WoTLK were but lead WoW into a whole new direction.
---
Secretly, that's what I would love to happen, even though this game is far too old to keep milking in its retail form.
---
WF and TF Removed.
---
&gt;Tips is basically the bad part of this video
---
Like in every tips video
---
Exaclty my thoughts. I played a priest for quite a while (not on classic) and absolutely love the class. But played rogue as well and love it.
---
I like to pla on my own sometimes so farming as holy priest will be an asbolute pain compared to RFD/SM pickpocket runs.
---
I totally agree, healer will be easier in terms of time/effort, rogue will require more time. Thanks for the tip, I will keep that in mind!
---
Totally agree. You just listed everything that made original wow great. 
---
Make it s Tauren and go forgetabull 
---
Any one remember this gem? 
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.11\_(Evil\_Patch\_Notes)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.11_(Evil_Patch_Notes))
---
You just answered your own question. Unless that doesn’t work anymore. Then idk
---
What did a run consist of? Any gear requirements? Any special tricks?
---
I'll definitely play PvP only casually. But I'll be doing it quite a bit at 19, 29, 39, 49 to take breaks from grinding. And at 60 I'll most likely play more PvP than PvE.
---
It was possible to run demo through wow.exe (not sure if it really was "wow" name). But yes, guess it'll be possible.
---
Original wow vanilla was only around for 26 months before TBC launched.  With 6 phases you're looking at an average of 4 months per phase (with 2 week variations as leeway).
---
What are you asking? If it'll be possible in Classic? Probably not since it'll be a new client and you're saying they've taken that ability out. 
---
I don't know if they have taken it out, I just can't find any executable except for the launcher
---
I do too. I liked the divide on PvP servers.
---
Yeah I wouldn't be expecting to top the damage charts but I would want to be required for a little bit more than just tranq shot.
---
I'm honestly so conflicted about which class to play. I am still tempted by warrior after all these years, especially with the classic cookie cutter build and I also loved Fury warrior in pve all those years ago. 
---
Didn't know it also worked for quest items. Also have the same trouble. TIL! Thanks
---
Castsequence was allegedly available during the demo, so I'm not sure they plan on turning it off.  
---
&gt;hopefully they’ll be able to open up the API while still keeping automated play out of the picture.
---
That is an incredibly contradictory statement.  Its like saying "Hopefully they open the tool box while keeping us from using any of the tools."
---
I don't know what you mean
---
I totally forgot Druid’s had a quest line for most forms and Hunter/Warlocks have to earn their pets. That’s what made me put class identity on the list.
---
I did levels 1-60 as a human warrior. I didn't have a specific method, just did quests etc and maybe a bit of grinding if the quests seemed too difficult. It was all blind back then. Every new area was a new adventure! 
---
I honestly don't remember warrior being that brutal to level (everyone says it's tough) but then again I have never levelled a druid or hunter to 60 so I guess warrior is like my reference point. 
---
You're right, my memory failed me. Cast Sequence did work on classic. I apologize for spreading false information. :)
---
Wouldn't it be possible to open the toolbox, just with some of the tools taken away?
---
i dont understand peoples reasoning to play the same thing they did back then, this is like a second chance you're more likely to build new memories and experience more doing something "new". 
---
People who are planning to repeat the journey again with everything the exact same have a higher chance of ruining their fond memories as it might not be what you remembered.
---
Kinds think this is cool lol. Just tell people it was really dedicated RP.
---
Classic WoW will never end after the last stage is released. Some people are playing Classic for 4 or 5 years on private servers.
---
I feel you! I was 14 when i played vanilla, Took me 1 year to get to Max level. Now i want to see all the content above bwl (didn‘t get to Nef though). Excitement level over 9000!
---
This sub is just one upping people with older and older screenshots and I love it
---
This thread has been a great read. Even for a filthy casual who probably won't ever raid again.
---
A mobile Diablo game.
---
Wait...
---
Fuck.
---
There are slots for rogues for sure, but they are very   coveted and you end up fighting over gear with the fury wars which is tough
---
Reminds me of [Buddhist](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=36919), the original no button player. What a god. 
---
Im not advocating for restarting the server,  because that doesnt do anything.  Im saying blizz needs to add more.  Whether its more vanilla content or upgrading to TBC
---
All that functionality existed in Vanilla.
---
Infact Vanilla was the king of AddOns because the code was less restricted and you could do more.
---
Weapon swapping could be done with macros, or hell even key binds...
---
true paladins click holy light out of the spellbook. 
---
I've pretty much decided to play a shaman, mostly for PvE healing, though I might dabble in PvP at some point. I'm not yet sure on what race to make them though. I am absolutely in love with the tauren lore, theme, looks, everything, but I don't know if a PvE resto tauren makes sense considering their racials. Maybe a troll is more optimal with their 10 second haste increase? Orcs seem to mostly make sense in PvP, with their stun resist, Blood Fury and Command are probably wasted on a resto shaman.
---
Bottom line is that I don't know if guilds are going to require certain class race combinations for late game PvE, which I would like to participate in. 
---
Well, you're wrong. I've used that exact macro for all my melee classes across many different private servers.
---
Case and point: https://streamable.com/db29o

Cast frostbolt(6)
---
Crap sorry manage to miss / in my macro fixing now.....afk1m 
---
selfie stick selfie stick selfie stick please be selfie stick
---
Will be the best 2 years ever 
---
Ashenvale. I was a Night Elf Hunter with no previous experience of PvP games. It was my trial by fire. Loved it.
---
STVietnam is also an iconic zone in my memories for the same reason.
---
How is right click reporting even a bad thing... This is ridiculous.
---
Locks solo Princess runs as well.
---
I would guess a longer p1 and p2 
---
First off raiders need to hit 60
---
Then they need to gear up 
---
Then they need to kill onyxia enough times to get enough with cloaks so they can take on bwl.  
---
With 40man raids and 1 ony raid/week means you have to do her 40 times to be confident to down nef.  
---
That’s 40weeks  but let’s say you do it with 20man with the cloak. That’s 20weeks or 5month.  
---
And onyxia is hard before you got MC under some level of control.  
---
Well, I learned basic english by playing FF6 with a dictionary by my side.
---
You should keep the game in english IMO and use that as an incentive for your son to learn the language.
---
Gonna be honest... Most of my time playing WoW I was a spell clicker. I’ve never been able to move my hands to hit keybinds. If the key could be pressed without moving my hand then I could use it. 
---
Using speech to text to cast spells in chat
---
:)
---
My highest world pvp kill count was on the MC chain 
---
I ran up in to a mc raid and killed 7 before  they killed me.  
---
Mind control jump /fear /mc again works wonders.  
---
Not necessarily. I think of it as having driven your first car 20 years ago, and now finding it fully restored and gifted back to you by your parents. You go on a merry trip once more with it. Sure, it's not the *exact* same as it was for your first time (nothing ever is), but it brings back so many lovely and fond memories and feelings.
---
P.S; this time we know Classic is staying for good, so there is a shitload of time to both relive your old journeys, and also try out new things (personally I will try to level an Ally character to 60 since I never did in Vanilla).
---
Teldrassil. Started as a night elf. Also Elwynn and Duskwood.
---
Important thing to remember about Expose Weakness (8p buff) is that if you have multiple 8p DS hunters each application will take a seperate debuff slot if they procc at the same time
---
This basically. By the time AQ rolls around, most people do a full MC clear in like 50 minutes. 
---
But why would you still do T1 content if you are farming/trying T2? Wouldn't you naturally upgrade from T1 to T2?
---
The reality is that there will be lots of hunters vying for spots in any raiding guild worth its salt. Not because they're great dps, but because it's hot competition.
---
If you're deadset on playing one and can show up to raids consistently though, you'll find a place.
---
I wouldn't be daunted by people saying that everyone is going to be playing warrior, because I remember they were still the most sought after class besides healers. Play what brings you the most fun.
---
Please share this preciosity!
---
\&gt; Wouldn't it be possible to open the toolbox, just with some of the tools taken away? 
---
Not really?  I mean the box has always been open, just the tools are different.  Today we have castsequence, in vanilla we had more functions available.  What I keep seeing are people saying "I don't want to be able to use modern macros" coupled with "I don't want automated functions like in Vanilla".  
---
Taken to their logical conclusion, people don't want macros at all, so they can play WoW like they were 12 again and didn't know any better.  (been there.  I think my most complex macro in vanilla was a /script PetAttack() coupled with hunters mark).
---
Its like Alterac Valley.  Everyone was all #nochanges until they were told they were getting 1.12 AV, and then suddenly everyone's memory and preference for AV took priority over authenticity.  I'm sure its part of the reason why Blizz is being so tight-lipped on various aspects of classic, because any reveal of information is instantly scrutinized and jumped on by anxious fans perched in the gallery waiting to swoop in and cry their crocodile tears of "this isn't right".  
---
At this point, they're probably focused on just releasing the thing and fixing any glaring differences later, because arguing over what a game SHOULD be like is a double edged sword.  On the one hand, its great to have people engaged and interested in whats going on.  On the other, people can get really toxic, to the point multiple CMs have quit over the years because they got tired of dealing with this shit.
---
Unless you are trying for world firsts or speedrunning race wont matter (outside of dwarf priest everybody prefers those, but they aren't gonna turn down a healer regardless) 
---
If your gonna do a decent amount of pvp go orc (or tauren if your into their burst/stunlock thing post aq)
---
This just gave me an idea.. Could you play only using a keyboard? Is there anything that absolutely necessitates mouse usage? The only thing that comes to mind, is you probably wouldn't be able to interact with objects? Like quest items on the ground.
---
I am waiting for a not out of season and in time april fools joke. 
---
Like making J. Allan Brack a playable race 
---
Warlock and paladin mount quests at 60, shaman totem quests, rogue undercover and posion quests. The warriors big quest for that nice wirlwind axe.
---
Vanilla was indeed great.
---
Thing is I don't know what I'll find most fun! I played a Warrior to 60 before and I liked it. But shaman could really be the class for me. Or druid.. I kinda do like the idea of healing. Maybe. I just don't know!! Haha 
---
Any of the 3 are ok.  At end game in a raid of 40 people you won't get passed over because of race.  It's really personally preference, especially if you are resto.  I'm picking orc thematically.  Never played one and when I think of shaman I think of Thall/Rehgar but I think trolls and tauren are cool too.  Which race do you lean most toward?
---
Any consolation to the “please make this little change to fix this issue or make the game better” morons, and any “QOL” changes that make the game anything other than what it was in 2006...
---
Oh gosh, i forgot the shaman quests, particularly the low level ones at like level 4.
---
You can still do exactly this. No need for the launcher in particular. But IMHO you should let the launcher be open for patches and stuff.
---
I'm excited Jintha'alor is coming back.  Love me them outdoor elite areas because you had to be so careful going in alone, and that element of someone else coming in and starting to kill stuff making getting around easier was just great.  
---
We really shouldn't take this for granted. Especially since many people in the private servers scene only started playing vanilla in the private scene and they don't remember/know how it used to work.
---
Sharding
---
No wait they’re already doing that
---
Check out the “Life at 60” link at he top.  It’s a whole thread of people answering exactly this question for every class. 
---
Thanks, I just found the WoW.exe now
---
They had dwarfs in vanilla wow 
---
Where does creating a macro for every spell fit in on this?
---
I've got some more work to finish on it.  Currently its a bunch of formulas because I have a bunch of reference tables dumped in other sheets, and I want to simplify it to just straight hyperlinks.  There's also some manual tuning I'm doing as far as where start and end NPCs are since I don't want to just dump coordinates and would rather say they're in Brill, or at the Eastvale Logging camp or something.  I'm about 60% done.  Should be able to post it in a few days.
---
Hi folks, i can't decide between lock and druid... I will be playing horde. My main focus is world pvp and a bit of raid... The only thing that push me back from playing druid, is Tauren casting and moving animations as I plan to pvp as hybrid balance/resto...
---
Anyone can throw me a hand?
---
Sorry for my bad English
---
i got triggered by it, who makes a meme without checking the correct spelling REEE!
---
What is ridiculous is that people CONTINUE to beg for these changes.. We were promised WOW Classic, not Classic+! No changes!
---
Don't give them such ideas....
---
I was an Undead Warrior named Boneslayer. Besides Jubei I remember a super geared Night Elf Warrior that was big in the PvP scene. Can’t recall his name but I remember him running around in full T1 with T2 helm and pants, Deathbringer axe (The one that proc’d a shadowbolt), and the shield Drill borer’s disk. He was a beast at the time in terms of gear. 
---
Despicable you lol :P
---
This basically. I imagine given a 6 phase rollout that phase 2 isn't going to take more than 3 months, *maybe* 4.
---
Remember that the epic mount is not free by any means, you save a few hundred gold. So it's either get stuck on a 60% mount for potentially months or bite the bullet and pay the full price, which means if you want the epic warlock mount later for aesthetics you'll need to drop another wad of cash, but you can do this at a more leisurely pace. 
---
Totem quests are 4, 10, 20 and 30 if I remember correctly. 
---
 Despicable you lol :P
---
Not for me.
---
Not a dwarf hunter with a bear anymore, because I saw it in trailer and it was cool.
---
The game doesn't even have a release date or a beta yet..
---
Yes, I remember this video from back in the day. World pvp only /cast 
---
Healing a tank is little different than dpsing in reverse
---
In all my years playing wow and following the game, I’ve never seen this YouTube video! Thank you! 
---
I do not beg for changes. I just think that these kind of reporting options should be in the game for a valid reason: blizzard can't deal with every report as a ticket. That would be an insane amount of tickets showing up.
---
The right click report doesn't change the gameplay at all so it's fine at least for me.
---
Plus I'd like to point out that we where promised a classic like experience. Not everything being 1:1 the same.
---
This guy has achieved enlightenment
---
I dont know but one would think there'd be a command for that?
---
Tried googling to find that ["not possible](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/1827663748) 
---
jokes on you, i renamed my swifty one shot macro to 'Despacito.
---
Can't accept most quests then, can you? 
---
Well, you seem kinda hot headed in regards to the issue so I'm not going to waste time poking back at you too much. With that being said, I don't feel like customization options for how your character looks is a fair comparison to mount ITEMS that drop in-game, that fundamentally change how people prioritize potential dungeon/raid drops, for example.
---
myeah I guess fighting over ie weapons ( tho tbh fury use mostly the same preraid until like aq) with like 10 people but so do casters
---
I do with Arms was viable but that fucking debufflimit wont allow it. Some of those warriors should focus on 2h instead.
---
Sorry, a noob question: Is every name available in the new server? If so, I wil try short names, I'm writing down my possibilities.
---
Because having 10 people get together and report you in Classic is a lot worse than it is in BFA. If enough people get together and right click report someone, it'll trigger the automatic bot to mute or suspend that person. Keep in mind that being muted takes away a LOT of the game in classic as you need to be able to talk to do most of the game.
---
Now I think you can see how this may be abused. The devilsaur mafia can just disconnect/mute anyone for tagging a devilsaur.
---
People in BGs can get someone possibly disconnected from a BG. 
---
A multiboxer can possibly mute, disconnect or suspend someone *single handedly*
---
A guild can mute or suspend anyone they'd want. Gank someone in STV? Now their guild are all gonna report you and get you muted, dc'd or suspended.
---
There are plenty of other possibilities, those were just a few.
---
If you don't like pets go druid. If you like DoTs, pets and shadowbolt go druid. If like speeding around as a cat and escaping situations go druid. If you like a free mount go warlock
---
Stonetalon and Hillsbrad are both generally overrun with gankers, and horde sees them starting at 20.
---
Who is this Frist you speak of? 
---
No one's begging for it you dense fuck.  Most of us understand it's a community policing implementation to allow Blizzard to reduce their GM labor force.  
---
&gt;We were promised WOW Classic, not Classic+
---
It's not Vanilla it's Classic which is already Vanilla+.  If you don't like it don't play.
---
60 mounts won’t be available until phase two because it requires dire maul
---
Seeing as rogues are warlocks hardest counter, it might pay off to roll human if you're going to roll an alliance warlock. Escape artist can be nifty in some situations, but warlocks can dispell many slows with felhunter, warrior and rogue slows bein an exception. That detection range is insane anyways.
---
Paranoid much eh?
---
It doesn't happen that often. Yes it occurs, yes stuff like that happens. But not as often as you might think.
---
When stuff like that happens to you you have the option to contest that mute/ban whatever. And usually the people who abuse that get a mute/ban by themselves.
---
Chromie's time travel device is not 100% accurate and some players might end up in DS Cata instead. 
---
Yeah, seems like they either do this, do something like ladder resets or have an optional TBC server. 
---
The last one seems least likely. 
---
But horde don't have to go there.. they can grind in Barrens all the way to 30 if they want.
---
Alliance don't have that option. Once you hit 20ish you HAVE to leave westfall. You can't grind westfall to 30.
---
Yeah, me too.
---
I don't know what's going on between me and the Hinterlands but I've always loved this zone and I make sure to go through it whenever I level a character. There's something special with that zone.
---
I'll definitely go back there when Classic releases.
---
A little early for that there bud?
---
A lot of people are organizing pre-launch.
---
Must be exalted with all Vanilla factions on a race/class combo only available in Vanilla.
---
&gt; Keep in mind that being muted takes away a LOT of the game in classic as you need to be able to talk to do most of the game.
---
No you don't and you can still whisper.  You guys seem to have this disillusion that Classic's going to be played any differently than the Vanilla private servers. 
---
&gt;Now I think you can see how this may be abused. The devilsaur mafia can just disconnect/mute anyone for tagging a devilsaur.
---
And then it's investigated and that entire group of players gets banned.
---
Made a giggly jump on my toilet while Reading this. Thanks!
---
Classic only for mobile 
---
That doesn't happen in retail now. People STREAM themselves mass reporting people and getting them dc'd without any type of punishment.
---
Blizzard is adding loot trading to classic to cut down on customer service, do you really think that they are going to devote the customer service needed to oversee the automatic system?
---
Perception can be really strong but you kinda have to know that there's a rogue nearby. If you're caught by surprise its useless. Great for dueling and everytime you see a rogue heading towards you and stealthing!
---
Warrior or Shaman? 
---
Not a lot of evening / weekend time to play but will raid if poss and dungeon, PvP whenever. 
---
Love tanking don't mind healing at all either not sure if I want to pay the hybrid tax though as I played Paladin first time around. Will also more than likely be sat on a laptop on a sofa not at a desk. 
---
Help needed thanks all 
---
Not sure if it's an US thing or something, I've never seen that ever in my life until Classic was announced. DM is Deadmines, DM:E, DM:N etc is Dire Maul. Always been like this on every server I played on and none of my friends understand a shit about this VC thing.
---
i think you can. bots can accept quests without mouse use
---
Every post in this sub is some idiot like you making suggestions and asking for changes to the original game... If Classic has any features or changes that didn’t exist in the game in 2006, then it’s not Classic, it’s Classic+, which isn’t what we were promised or what the folks who asked for this relaunch for the past 12 years wants. My take is that if you don’t like that, then you don’t have to play, and we’d be better off without dense fucks like yourself in the game with us... 
---
I'd personally rather have Hardiness to counter Rogues, but I guess if you're going Alliance then the Human racial might be great.
---
So because it's released later it shouldn't be concidered what so ever at all as a part of why some classes are unique? ^^
---
With player knowledge of the state of the different classes in 1.12 and overall player experience knowing how each class plays, most definitely.
---
Most people coming back who have not played in the past decade still have a pretty good idea of at least what they enjoy rather than going in blind, and those coming from  retail or private servers know what classes (mostly) they want to be.
---
There isn't much blind discovery, so people will be far more likely to pick some lesser played classes like the warlock, shaman, or druid.
---
Pretty much this. I probably look up where to go after I finish an area, where to go next.
---
But Mulgore and Barrens. I shall do them without help. 
---
It will definitely happen in Classic way more than retail. Classic is a lot more competitive when it comes to resources and the honor system specifically. Hardcore players will definitely abuse the fuck out of it.
---
Do you really think they are going to devote the customer service power needed for classic to oversee it properly? They added loot trading to the game to reduce gm tickets.
---
I will certainly go back to my nightelf hunter. I already get a huge nostalgia when I just went to Teldrassil and visited Shadowglen. Standing there, doing the same quests, maybe more efficient now, and seeing all those things that made me love the game. I think that's wonderful.
---
^ essentially why escape artist is better given that you can use it re-actively.
---
But play what makes you happy ofc.
---
Thats even better, huntrt would just be the safer option with feign death if you pull packs that you kill
---
&gt;"good" 2H-Weapons
---
&gt;My guess would be hunter
---
Found the hunter main.
---
Ha, didn't know you could trade in the bullets for arrows, super cool little thing 
---
The sense if community.
---
I remember once, helping some random guy one day, about 20 levels below, we talked specs, I gave him some tips to try out, bit he couldn't afford to respect because it was up to 50 silver.  I gave him like 2 gold and a some bow greens I had to help him out and wished him luck.
---
About 3 months later, in lvl 60, chilling out in ironforge when someone opens trade and puts in 100g.   What's the for?  I had no idea who it was.  It was the lowbie all grown up.   He remembered me and the first time he saw me again, he wanted to thank me for helping him.lkt was nice to reconnect with a random person I played with in a random leveling spot 
---
Yeah, but it's pre-beta and pre-release date. Pre-launch is like, the month beforehand.
---
I mean *technically* it's pre-launch right now, but, like, come on.
---
&gt;That doesn't happen in retail now.
---
But it does, I know people who have been banned specifically for false reports.
---
&gt; People STREAM themselves mass reporting people and getting them dc'd without any type of punishment.
---
DO people REALIZE what IS happening AND submit A petition TO a GM?
---
&gt;do you really think that they are going to devote the customer service needed to oversee the automatic system?
---
Yes, unless they want subscription losses and someone to eventually go Stephen Pollock at Blizzcon.
---
I'm personally a bit torn between Tauren and Troll. I like playing Tauren and I like Warstomp for PvP, but I feel like I should probably go Troll since they're the best PvE race and that will be my main focus.
---
A release date.
---
&gt;they added loot trading to the game to reduce GM tickets
---
Which is a fair compromise. And this is exactly what I'm talking about: blizzard's customer support isn't that big or chill as it used to be. At the end of the day it's about money. It's sad, and it sucks yes. But it's the truth.
---
And if people keep abusing that reporting feature they recieve a higher ban time until eventually recieving a permanent ban. It has been like that since... Forever.
---
so I very much love healing in wpvp and bg (without sacrificing the possibility to be relevant in pve) 
---
I was a main priest for years and I long to spam jump while I dispell and mana burn people as an undead. 
---
HOWEVER I plan to duo with a friend and he still hesitates between frost mage and spriest.
---
I was looking for another class to roll if he ends up choosing priest, and I spent the last two days documenting on hybrid shaman.
---
TL;DR : do you guys think I could be a potent pvp healer as ele-resto sham with a spriest friend?
---
In my eyes every twohander should go to the pally /s
---
Well, it can be abused.
---
I think there were already some instances where streamers got reported by the whole enemy team in a BG and their account was banned for a while. 
---
the problem seems to be that if you are reported multiple times in a short time frame that you account gets temp banned automatically without Blizz checking if the reports were justified.
---
I'm not into the whole meta-prep myself, but a lot of people are. You can dislike it if you want, and maybe for good reasons, but that doesn't change the fact that thousands of people are preparing. Let this guy find likeminded players, what's the harm?
---
It was in vanilla but might have been removed by 1.12 from what I understand?
---
Im in the same boat as you, Shaman!!!!! cant wait to play it. Rolling Tauren cause they look so bad ass and are so big. The only thing I would like is to be able to ride a wolf, the kodo are just a little to big for me!   
---
Go Tauren man!!! Mooooooo rock the biggest shoulders and gear out there.
---
It's an RPG the name is half your character. 
---
This site really is a blessing. Haven't gotten in contact with anyone from my server (US - Executus) but there's at least a few recognizable names on there, including someone who was in my old guild (and actually helped me remember the name of the guild in the first place!).
---
If you dont have a lot of time shaman is probably your best bet. Warrior will take you more time to level and be more competitive for earning a tanking spot. Youll have to be a lot more dedicated to your guild if u want to be a primary tank. My two cents! :)
---
&gt;	If you like DoTs, pets and shadowbolt go ~~druid~~ warlock
---
gotcha
---
You could rebind a lot of things. I used to play SWTOR with a PS4 controller and it worked surprisingly well. I just had to be clever about how I set it up.
---
I believe this video is a fake as i cannot see the FRAPS trial logo at the top 
---
:P
---
It’s easier as BM, but not needed, just dps fast and watch out for the stun. I think you can scatter shot or pet stun him, I can’t remember tbh
---
&gt; Every post in this sub is some idiot like you making suggestions and asking for changes to the original game
---
Did I make a single suggestion, check my post history has there ever been a single change advocated by me (not made in jest) on this sub for Classic?  No, go fuck yourself.
---
&gt; If Classic has any features or changes that didn’t exist in the game in 2006, then it’s not Classic, it’s Classic+, which isn’t what we were promised or what the folks who asked for this relaunch for the past 12 years wants. 
---
You have downs, we're already starting with a non-authentic product is not Vanilla, quit calling Vanilla Classic.
---
&gt;My take is that if you don’t like that, then you don’t have to play
---
I'm fine with that, I've been on private servers since WoD.  If Classic launches and I don't like the product I'm back to whatever private server.
---
Ty a lot. I saw the great vid you did with Kargoz on his channel. There you also explained how grenades worked and said you learnt that from Ohhgee, so I checked out Og and in his newest vid he praises the undispellable priest fear! 
---
Just wanted to let you know, thought I had to now that I see You commenting here! :D
---
Again really good job on that consumes vid, its really awesome.
---
Cheers
---
Yep, i actually went 1 year+ in retail vanilla playing hunter and not knowing about this at all, so using a gimped pet. There is no quest or hints/info anywhere in the game that tells you about this system, all you're told about is the pet trainer
---
I’m excited for old school level 19 twinking 
---
based on everything I've been reading on this sub for the past week, troll rsham is the race if you really care about min-maxxing in pve
---
orc is better suited for enhance, and tauren makes a good ele/restau/hybrid in pvp thanks to war stomp
---
correct me if I'm wrong
---
At least we got a soulstone every 30 minutes :)
---
The april fools joke this year will be the entire tauren race defecting to the Alliance.  If you have a tauren character, effective immediately you are automatically transferred to the Alliance.  
---
Yeah, easter egg from the recent blizzcon. It's a tuesday too which lines up with patch days etc... 
---
Woops thanks for the catch there
---
Ya I don't get that, most of them raided Naxx in vanilla. Are we supposed to only have talks with top level vanilla players who haven't played the game in a decade? I'm fairly sure they aren't going to have good enough memory to get most of the stuff right.
---
It'll depend on the actual class I'll be playing. 
---
&gt;Who will have priority on alliance side? 
---
Shamans
---
Announce a Netflix documentary, 
---
Mankrik's wife:  The beaten body ....
---
....  This 52 episode series will finally answer all your questions. .
---
If you like civilized but want to play horde I recommend going for a female troll. They have 1 face in particular that is pretty normal. Then you put small tusks and good hair and they look pretty civilized. They look good in the mage sets as well. Play around with it and see how you feel. View all the races in their end game armor and see what appeals too u most. GL! 
---
April Fools Classic is coming next years summer!
---
Warrior over anyone else not Hunter lol it's not vanilla all over again, why would a Hunter take priority? 
---
Same for horde side. No class should take priority of a 2 Handed weapon if a warrior wants it first. Surely? 
---
So based on this what do you suggest? That people just don't talk about the classes/specs until Classic comes out even though we have the resources currently to make a very good approximation of how it did play?
---
No one is claiming they have perfect knowledge. Most of them outright say things will change and in the tip's video their are plenty of cases where people have said "but this might change in classic". 
---
&gt;Ever done 200+ wipe boss progression?
---
Yes, and the feeling after we finally got it was more like relief. It was like the end of the South Park" WoW episode when they finally get their goal &amp; they had a muted "yay" for about two seconds before they moved on to other things.
---
It was kinda fun the first time going through that, there's a sense of accomplishment, etc. But nobody is really patting you on the back, unless you have a solid group of friends/guildies who enjoy that play style.
---
Well youve won
---
Yeah? Despite having an suboptimal setup? I've heard shaman are ability heavy so pressing many things quickly might be an issue!
---
Impressive work
---
These were the days when the entire world was new, finding the right 'path' -- no quest help, no knowledge of dungeons and/or group parties, and when many of these quests could not be solo'd, even if the quest didn't say group.
---
My best memory in Beta was near the end, when the developers / GM's would 'take over' one of the bosses in that zone, and literally have a live battle with us at our level.  It was insane, fun, you learned how to use the world chat, and it's one of my very best memories of being in the beta.  It was like the SS/TM battle, but with the dev's being the big, bad bosses of the zone.
---
Using voice commants cast the spells
---
Expansions.
---
Can call confirm that on kilrogg Ally side it was always called VC. You saw DM every once in a while, but 90% VC
---
It does on some private servers I believe but I think its one of those heavily contested things. From what I've heard it did do it at some points in Vanilla but this was a bug and it only happened early on if at all. Likely won't be in Classic.
---
&gt;because I remember they were still the most sought after class besides healers.
---
No, tanks are the most sought after, not warriors. Many warriors can't or refuse to tank and other classes can tank, depending on the content.
---
Neat!
---
As an alternative to developing the muscle memory for regular keybinds you may want to buy a MMO mouse with extra buttons on the side that you can press with your thumb.
---
First-MC BRE to something other than a warrior is g-quit material. Just cut your losses. 
---
You will find that if you remain a hunter, by the time you reach Naxx, you will be needed for many, many of the boss fights -- not so much for Tranq, but for your capability of kiting.  Learn kiting mobs.
---
And hopefully, you can do that by kiting some of the larger dragons / world bosses to the local cities for fun and frolic.  :)
---
Same. I always do 58/59-60 in winter spring. I do mining/arcanite farming in winter spring. I love that zone. 
---
I spent atleast a week ingame (was between lvl40 and 50) when I found out I could stick more action bars around. The strugle to choose what spells I needed on the bar was real!
---
Hmm do I realy need to Charge the mobs..? I mean, it is safer to pull with my bow.. or perhaps just body pull?
---
Yeah dude, patient pulls ftw
---
So, say. I'm speed running my NE hunter. I'm going for an owl from the starter zone. Would you think it's a good idea to just go with the owl till 60 and then tame new pets? Or better to tame an extra pet around level 20 or so to get the extra abilities?
---
&gt;but we are committed to make an authentic, blizzard quality classic experience. We want to reproduce the game experience that we all enjoyed from the original classic WoW.*
---
That doesn't sound to me like a 1:1 promise. It's going to be very much like vanilla but raging about every little shit such as right click report is ridiculous. It doesn't affect your gameplay. If it's abused the abuser recieved a ban and you're good to go again in like 10 minutes. It happend to me it's not a big deal. I contest the automute and literally 15 minutes later everything was good.
---
*Blizzcon classic announcement. 4:50

https://youtu.be/dUSRkBwQdc8
---
Worth noting that a lot of it is useful information for people who don't play private servers. I know a lot of people I talked to think Block is a type of rating in vanilla and didn't understand how it worked. Tip's goes through that in his latest deep dive. Is that useful information for a private server tank? No, is it useful for a new player? Yes.
---
The deep dives are aimed at people who've played WoW but not Vanilla or Private servers and have good information for that and very good guests. I think they have a valid place, just not among hardcore vanilla players.
---
Vs warrior and rogue succubus is really strong. 
---
Could be some NA / EU difference then. Only time someone write VC was a misspell for Wailing Caverns :P
---
Having played primarily PvE servers in vanilla, he is correct. 
---
To answer the above question, I wouldn’t be surprised if they keep it “no changes” and make you roll your second faction on a second pvp server. 
---
There's something wholesome and innocent about that Shimmy guy discovering the ingame emote system. I remember doing the same when I first played.
---
I'm fairly certain it will work this way on PvP servers. The bigger question is whether you can converse with RL friends on the same server on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), even if they are playing the opposite faction. Of course they can use Discord, Ventrilo, Teamspeak, Mumble, Skype, etc. - but for Blizzard to actually support that via [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) would amount to them conditioning the community that it's ok to collude cross-faction.
---
You still do MC, because it only takes like 30mins-1hour to do and you get t2 pants from rag. You also get chance at thunderfury bindings for the tanks, and there are still other good items in the raid as well. Doing t1 content will still yield upgrades for your raid, despite bwl being out. Gotta realise people don't get loot every run.
---
I know right? Just to think about all the insane game modes that will be possible when Reforged comes out blows my mind.
---
I had a very nice player explain to me how to stop clicking and using keybinds and  these other 3 buttons on my mouse and especially how to turn fast with the mouse, use addons for healing and more.... I was like: "That's a whole new world, now I know why they are so much faster than I am, I am not a shitty player I JUST DIDN'T KNOW!" (I was still a slow player, just not THAT slow anymore.)
---
Unfortunately that player logged off one day and never came back, so I do not know what happened and just hope they found something better do do with their life. 
---
If you go horde weapons is a little easier since most dps wars will be orc and lean towards axes
---
I'll give it a go!
---
No, I suggest that when we put guides together we have discussions just like this one to highlight that private server and current vanilla Meta might not carry over. 
---
It's good to have both sides challenged. At the end of the day we don't know how much or what was changed, but that's part of the problem. Since we don't know we can't fully inform new players of what and how they'll be playing. 
---
It'll be honest, I mailed a warrior in vanilla to wotlk and I wasn't tier one raider, but had successful progression. A personal friend was a a very invested pvp warrior at the time. 
---
Neither of us were aware of hamstring kiting being meta, and I was surprised to hear that it became meta on the private server. Because it goes against the original vanilla meta, and how the class is designed. 
---
And I get that meta is more than the designers intentions. But this meta has formed because private servers are not constructed the same way. 
---
And I think it's important to know that. I'm sure the veterans will adapt, but new players that might enjoy tanking could be discouraged from playing a warrior because they're concerned about slow leveling, and annoying hamstring strategies that rely on auto swing timer addons. 
---
The internet loves to parrot meta and best concepts without actually puttin them into practice. And I did, and hamstring kiting is awful. I don't think it's fair to let new players think that's an accurate representation of the class, or others. 
---
Hunter pets didn't have normalised size in the WoW beta, which made certain potential pets far more interesting.
---
Even if they weren't the best at DPS, you could (supposedly, I didn't play in it)  turn stuff like the wolf pups from LBRS or the Sewer Beast from Stormwind into a cool conversation piece, simply for their abnormal size.
---
Yeah, there are / commands usable in game that will accept and turn in quests. Macroing them onto a keybind temporarily can be useful for turning in repeatable quests over and over.
---
The thing about finding a group is not entirely true I dont think. Just need to find a guild. Also rogues very handy in Dm tributes. 
---
Eastern plaguelands was my first 60 so it really reminds me of that moment
---
Looking forward to listening to the podcast on my daily commute.
---
Keep up the good work, Josh!
---
How necessary is Lupos? I'm not going to be pushing world firsts or r14 it any of that crazy stuff, but I don't exactly plan on being a super casual either.
---
Is there a close 2nd (in both PVE and PvP)? Or not really?
---
Sounds a bit like my Uncle. He lived in Wiesbaden in the 80s (American) and learned German from TV. I followed the same thought when I lived there about 10 years ago.
---
I'm completely changing it up when classic gets released. My brother and I rolled alliance way back in Vanilla because our uncle was a well-established mage on the server and could give us tips and advice (but refused to give us gold lol - which I am now thankful for).
---
I played a human paladin in Vanilla, but plan on rolling an Orc warlock come Classic. I've always wondered if I would've gone horde originally if my uncle hadn't suggested to play Alliance, so I'm stoked to have the opportunity to "start over again" and see Azeroth from a completely different viewpoint. 
---
The troll racial lasts tens seconds and costs mana plus a gcd. It's not that impactful in my opinion. Being able to warstomp the mobs in dungeons that your bad tank didnt deal with and stay alive is way more worth imo. 
---
Spriests are beasts but have mana issues sadly. They can't chain-kill multiple players that easily, they need to sit down and drink a bit. At leas thats what I've observed, never played one myself.
---
I miss higher level quests that you had to either wait on or group up for.  It’s stuff like this that makes an MMO feel like an actual MMO.  You know, actually interacting with other players towards a common goal. 
---
Yea. But still avoidance &gt; 
---
Skinning onyxia gives 3 scales on average and each cloak only takes 1 scale. Also if players have the mechanics down she can fairly easily be split raided in two 20 man groups for twice as much loot.
---
Damn that sounds good! Im now torn between hunter and shaman. No reason I can't do both. :) 
---
That only works if you have 3 consecutive critical hits. Unlikely
---
Whatever it is, I hope it's not something really silly and hilarious that everyone enjoys as an April Fool's joke and then Blizzard misconstrues that interest and excitement over said joke as genuine desire to play an entire expansion based entirely around said joke, thus completely ruining the entire atmosphere of the game world they've created.
---
Would be a shame if something like that happened.
---
So the thing about the South Park episode is that everything in it is purposefully wrong, but just slightly wrong to enrage nerds. It’s part of the joke of the episode. 
---
Everyone who plays knows you can’t kill things significantly below your level to level up. 
---
It’s ridiculous for Cartman to call out that Kenny should add (I forget which spell) hunter’s mark to his action bars.
---
Humans can’t (at least back then) be hunters. 
---
You can’t trade items that you already equipped because tradable items are Bind on Equip. (In reference to Randy giving Stan the sword of truth, also an item not in the game to make people who play get annoyed with references to it, like your clueless mom asking if you have a sword of truth). 
---
As great of an episode it is, and as great of an advertisement it was for WoW, the episode doesn’t accurately portray the game... on purpose. 
---
Nice to meet you man. \^^
---
Hunters do great in MC and also BWL, but they start to drop off come AQ. They're still taken, also to naxx, but at that point it is indeed mostly for tranq shot as was said. 
---
That doesn't look anything like what they presented at blizzcon, and the engine should be the same since they said it will be cross-compatible with old wc3 (reforged and normal players can be in the same game)  
---
Do you have a source for this ? It looks like a chinese knock-off.
---
I really hope it comes out before Classic. That way we can experience the WC3 ----&gt; Vanilla transition in high definition.
---
But why's that? A warrior will raid in fury anyway 
---
Well if you arent able to attend consistently a fill in healer is a much better role than fill on tank.
---
Reforged is set to release winter 2019. Classic comes out this summer.
---
Not at all, since Classic will run on 1.12 where Lupos is just a normal wolf.
---
This is so cool! Even though I know its just idle chatter I'm curious what the text all says :)
---
Blind is impossible, as I have levelled so many different chars already that I know a lot of the quests fairly well. Otherwise definitely no quest helper addon or such and just enjoy the ride. If I cannot figure out how to do a quest, I'll probably look it up online.
---
Im levelling in a group of 3 with a Holy Paladin and a Protection Warrior, what should I be?
---
I played Orc Rogue and Fury Warrior back then on Horde, so this Alliance, I love melee classes/big smash weapons, but would enjoy the chance to be able to heal or cast spells at range.
---
I was thinking either a Ret Paladin or Feral Druid. Or just playing a rogue/warrior again. 
---
&gt;Loyalty builds with at least content (yellow) face and time with you in game
---
&gt;
---
Loyalty levels also require experience. Your pet's loyalty level will "ding" when both of the requirements are met.
---
I think you mean the barlog.
---
Theres some theories that dont seem too far fetched. 
---
But why's that? A warrior will raid in fury anyway
---
Definitely train skills. As you are most likely a BM hunter, a good chunk of your damage comes from your pet.
---
Depends on what pets you want to tame - in Classic when you are level 60 and tame a level 5 pet you need to level your pet all the way up to 60, so probably better to tame one when you are at the appropriate level rather then wait to catch up. It is really a bother to level a pet from 5-60 once you are max level yourself.
---
same if you want more then one pet - make sure you swap them out regularly to ensure they dont fall behind in level too much.
---
I doubt you can 20 man her without T1 gear. 
---
I could be wrong to.  But you can’t compare to t1/t2 equipped healers.  
---
And then you take in to account that ppl will leave. And sometime you hand out a cloak to wrong person meaning they don’t join raids all the time or even leave guild.  
---
3-4mo is more reasonable with 3scales tho.  
---
If you are looking to raid on your limited time and possible interruptions by the little one I would say go Priest or DPS. Tanks will need more focus, and more grinding time.
---
Based on what you laid out, Priest would be less gear dependent and would be faster to level. Warrior would make a really good 2nd character because you can feed it weapons and get help at 30 for WW axe making the leveling experience much smoother. 
---
Slam spec is another pve dps for warrior especially on horde side. Problem is I've not found enough details on it to really know when it becomes viable. 
---
Not as horde tho. And as ally you consider ranking warriors also
---
I don't think Lupos is as important as a good plan to be honest - as you said 12 hours camping you'd never get that back in dps gain while levelling.
---
If Lupos has shadow damage on Classic then I'll be swinging past to see if he's around when I'm at a suitable level, in case I jag him - but otherwise no special need to get him.
---
Broken Tooth would be a different story if you are planning to PVP though.
---
I watched the video, so let me rephrase it : "a solo warrior that doesn't have the best gear the game has to offer and doesn't have mad skillz and mad luck will always loose a 1v3". The guy tri-shoot another warrior ffs !
---
It's a bit like if I showed you a video of a formula 1 driver and told you you will always be able to escape a Police chase with your shitty car and your average driving skill.
---
I leveled 3 warriors in Vanilla, the third one on a PVP server. I was on first name basis with every graveyard angel of Azeroth :D
---
Tbh i see both. There's a lot of making fun of people saying they'll roll something non optimal like ret paladin, i even see highly upvoted posts calling them selfish and/or stupid for not playing optimally and min-maxing. It goes both ways and seems pretty 50/50 on this sub imo. 
---
Confirming that Paladin and Druid WERE intended to be raid-viable tanks for every encounter is pretty nice to hear.
---
2h fury is very viable. It's better than most dps spec by a long shot
---
Power through. Clicking is awful. I didn't do it in 2005 and don't do it now.
---
You'd pronounce that like "Tsementa" though. Very unpleasant.
---
shadowpriest is an 1v1 beast, not 1vX. They oom too quickly to kill multiple people and are easily bursted down when alone. 
---
Whatever you do pick something with a different armor class. 
---
Get a Strigid Hunter to start with as it comes with Claw 2  
---
After that I would use it to 60, but along the way stable pet as treasure mentioned and train additional skill levels for your pet, then teach them to your owl as you go.
---
Naga
---
Well you only need to finish ahead of the next guy. If queue times are long it's going to be low for everyone on that faction
---
Its viable if your 2handed weapon is better than your one handed weapons pretty much. You gear basically the same. Just dont go over hit cap  
---
The ele-resto build isn't really the best PvP healer. You throw some out here and there but you are more of a purge, totem, and burst class. Paladin and Priest are the healers that are more defensive and healing focused.
---
Contrary to popular belief vanilla wow wasn't a wasteland of misinformation. In 2005/6 I knew to use lupos or a wolf for furious howl or broken tooth as pets and weave arcane and multi shot between autos and how to spec and used keybinds and add-ons. I raised to aq40 and wasn't a noob. I imagine it would be fairly similar.
---
Imo, and i say this as a hunter main, they are not that awesome at 1vX. You only really have freezing trap, and it's harder to land that when theres several people on you. Also, if you burn your freezing trap and scatter shot on one guy, you have no tools left to stay ranged/kite the second/third guy on you, except wing clip which won't be enough 
---
You have bonereaver's edge as BiS for 2h fury all the way down. Do you think it is better than MoM or CorrAshebringer?
---
so you're telling me there is a chance
---
I got a Logitech G600 a week ago, I'm quite disappointed.
---
It's almost impossible to click the side buttons without doing a left or right click.
---
This mouse has no rest surface the whole thing is clickable, not a good design imo.
---
Especially as horde, with Windfury. Not sure for alliance. The lower hit required is Nice tho
---
This may be a silly question but will the quest line be the same? Figure that i wont be as hardcore as others so maybe i can preemptively collect for streamlined completion. 
---
I.e. - same materials, kills, gold? 
---
I remember the paladin quest line had some mob kills, materials / gold to complete. 
---
Force yourself to use keybinds. Most people who are good at using binds only got to that point by practicing.
---
For example I unbound Q+E from strafe, unbound D so I can't walk backwards, bound strafe to A+D so I can't turn and forced myself to learn to use the mouse + W,A,D for movement. Now I can use Q,E,D for spells. Also while you're at it you can unbind whisper reply from R and auto attack off T and use them too.
---
Other obvious binds to remove are Z,X,C,V and some people even unbind space as jump. A good tip is use mouse scroll up+down as different spells, and you can use shift/alt+mouse wheel up/down for even more efficiency from your mouse.
---
It seems hard and clunky at first because you're not used to it at all, but the more you play that way the easier it becomes.
---
Or, just keep clicking if it's what you really prefer!
---
Pretty much this but Orc is probably just better in PvP even as a Ele/Resto. Stun resist is just too good. It will help you so much with your survival. 
---
It must have been fun to be on the team coming up with spell ideas. I imagine there were some really wacky fun ones that never made it to the game.
---
It’s gonna be a good morning. Thanks Josh
---
I miss the good old days of Gamespot TV/X-Play. That whole channel, actually. It used to be ZDTV, then TechTV, then G4/TechTV, and then just G4, and now it's dead. 
---
monkeynews is very skilled, but those clips mean nothing regarding the viability of warrior 1v1 /1vX pvp. Monkeynews himself states that warrior is easily the worst 1v1 class in the game, and he is right. 
---
I get it that people always go for the argument: you have no escapes, here take this now you have one.
---
The problem with that logic is that the warlock has nothing to follow up with a simple slow/root dispell. The class is not designed around kiting an enemy. Even less in a world with FAP, LIP and RestP
---
On the other hand to double down on your actual strength usually yields better results - but that obviously depends on the playstyle of the player
---
When I started playing I played on a laptop with a trackpad. It didn't even occur to me that people used a mouse.
---
When I finally got an actual computer with a monitor I started using a mouse. I literally couldn't do anything for like a week but after that week everything was so much easier.
---
It isn't worth it to keep doing something stupid just because you've always done it. It's just going to take a hot minute to get used to it. 
---
Yes you have to bind "Interact with target" and you're set for quests and looting (it's how the multi-boxers do).
---
Camera moves would be my biggest pain I think.
---
Shadowglen will always hold a spot in my heart.
---
WoW being my first large scale game online, it was such a crazy feeling and concept to wrap my young head around. The music of Shadowglen and seeing so many people just doing their own thing was crazy.
---
It's so odd, I remember the zone so differently the first time I played from how the zone is actually structured. I also remember playing on the family PC which was less than good... Getting like 20fps and still having the best time of my life. 
---
Every time I hear that music I get goosebumps and smile. Such an awesome feeling and memory that I get to hold on to forever.
---
thanks for doing these. my hopefully constructive criticism however is just that the host can be needlessly verbose to where i just shut off the podcast until i can go home, download it, and play it back at 3x speed for the majority. like *get to the point* ugh. but anyway great work and thanks for these! just my personal peeve 😋
---
Banish assignments before raid markers was such a nightmare.   
---
"Warlock 1, focus the MT's current target"  
---
"Warlock 2, focus the MT's current target"  
---
"Warlock 3, focus the MT's current target"  
---
And at least two would still Banish the wrong add on pull.
---
If you want a guide that tells you what quests to do not how to do them I'd look up joanas guide. Really good stuff in there. It's also pretty cool because he does all sorts of quests that I never knew existed. It is for horde only though
---
S 2x.
---
Is CoW the go-to curse to apply to Hunter pets?
---
Nobody will notice you are clicking. It really doesn't matter. If it works it works.
---
No I know it wasn't. But I'm also painfully aware of some new things now than I was back then. Farming spots, a few bis items, etc. I would definitely farm a lot better.
---
You need to stable that bad boy and tame a pet with the next rank of the same ability in the wild. Then you play with the new pet until you learn that skill, release the temporary pet and grab your original pet and teach it the new rank.
---
Don't skip this step or your pet's focus dump skill will be trash bag.
---
I fully agree but I'm surprised this is upvoted
---
&gt;  Also rogues very handy in Dm tributes. 
---
who cares
---
there is nothing preraid bis there afaik
---
besides  a +dagger belt but you are unlikely to start mc with daggers
---
Yeah mainly just I'd be a bit more efficient but nothing drastic.
---
I love undead rogue but I kinda wanna try alliance tho then I have  big problems picking a race :D dont wanna minmax human sword
---
I wonder how viable dagger specs are in blues
---
You have a healer... You have a tank...  
---
Basically just roll DPS and you're all set for questing/dungeoning/pvp'ing.
---
Shiny weapons: Rogue
---
Group support: Feral Druid
---
CC'ing: Mage
---
Alternate solutions: Hunter, Shadow Priest
---
If you want to take end-game into account feral druid and shadow priest won't be very good bets.
---
Wouldn't roll warlock... things will die fast enough. 
---
I probably won't listen to the whole pod cast, but do you have a time stamp where they talk about this? I'd like to hear about it because I tracked pally in TBC, would have loved to be able to MT in classic for raids. 5 man's it was no issue but raids was a no go
---
I'd crush it on AH, and rule the server.
---
Escape Artist is really good against mages because you can remove freeze effects which gives them 50% increased crit chance with the shatter talent. You can of course dispell freeze with felhunter, but that is very RNG dependent as you will have several magic debuffs on you from the mage.  
---
Its also very good against warriors. After they have zerker charged you and applied hamstring, you can coil or net them and use EA. The warrior has no chance to catchup before his zerker charger is off CD again.  
---
    
---
Against hunters you can guarantee to remove concussive shot. Felhunter can also dispell this slow, but if he has hunters mark on you, you can get unlucky and dispell the mark rather than the concussive shot. It also allows you to remove Wing Clip, which your Felhunter wont be able to dispell.  
---
   
---
Unfortunately by the time Naxx comes, Hunters are only really needed for utility. Their damage is not very good at all. Obviously this is assuming the guild is high-end and min/maxxing. But 2 hunters for tranq shot is all a top guild really needs.
---
I remember getting shit from my cl for having two freezing band rings I picked up for around 25g each instead of stacked int rings. Fun times.
---
The old hunter pet abilities were pretty cool, to bad they were scrapped.

I’m pretty sure you won’t need the expansion. since they made all previous expansions included in subscription cost, the ‘main client’ is basically just having a subscription
---
"The global cooldown timer has been added to all spells and abilities"
---
T O X I C
---
You guys are legends, thank you!! 
---
He legit had some of the best random pvp videoa of the time. His bankai-vid will live on for eternity.
---
I played rogue in like 9/10 years playing WoW.
---
Naturally ill play rogue again.
---
Since i've played alliance back in classic ill go alliance again.
---
But what the hell i cant decide on the class.
---
My original rogue was female human.
---
The 10% more rep (i want all the mounts) and the sword spec are insanely good.
---
But gnomes and nightelfes look way better..
---
I honestly just want to tame a cat at lvl 10~ around dark shore and use him as my main as long as I play classic.
---
I will primarily play PvP, but will raid too. Is this a good call?
---
True! Loved going back to Northrend for this.
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
\^This. Get Razer Naga mouse, and get used to it. You won't regret it.
---
It's already been announced that you'll only need a subscription.
---
Castbars were somewhat accessible. There were addons to show them.
---
Detect invis does absolutely nothing vs Stealth. It only works vs potions and reveals some ghostly fluff npcs
---
\-  
---
Paranoia is where its at as it gives you +30 stealth detect (+6 levels) and perception gives you +20 (+4 levels) for a total of +10 levels before we talk about catseye elixirs +9 (almost 2 lvls) and bloodvine lenses +9 (again almost 2 lvls)
---
So a human warlock can be lvl 74 for stealth detect
---
\-
---
Which gives you sight way beyond mere 30y. People have to keep in mind that we will launch with 1.12 post plenty of the nerfs to stealth. 
---
meanwhile rogues can only spec +15 (3 lvls) in stealth (or +5 lvls if they are NE as shadowmeld gives them +10 stealth)
---
in comparison a rogues + senses only gives them +5 (1 lvl )in stealth detect
---
So a tryhard team with a hunter (track hidden +30), a warlock pet(paranoia +30), catseye(+9) and an on use bloodvine(+9) pushed a hunter into a 76 entity. They could see rogues in warsong before they were even in range to place hunters marks (a 100y ability)
---
and every rogue who has ever gone up against something like that can tell you a story about it as it has you instantly begging for a dispel
---
Ick. That sounds like reverse winter in new england (where you stay indoors to avoid the cold).
---
I need to breathe, man. I didn't move here to live in a tomb, haha.
---
Haven’t had a chance to listen yet, so if this is addressed, just ignore me:
---
Isn’t this strictly from the class designer?  It would make sense for him to have this image of everyone being able to handle multiple roles, but the raid designers and equipment designers apparently had VASTLY different ideas on that subject, or at the very least mechanics were so borked fundamentally it wasn’t possible until they basically threw threat and mana regen out the window.
---
They say size doesn't matter, but I do like tauren partially for that reason as well. They look very imposing :P 
---
I don't know if this is in vanilla, but surely you can buy other faction's mounts if you get exalted with them? I want a wolf for my tauren :o
---
Stopped the video halfway to make this comment. I have no idea how this making-of has slipped me when I believe I've watched every single video related to this game.
---
To hear the original devs and artists speak about it with so much passion and excitement, it just brings a tear to my eye but also fills me with pride, even though I am no part of this team. I'm just proud of them and of Blizzard for making such an amazing game.
---
It's also funny because I heard things spoken by them in this video which no longer appear to be part of current Blizzard's mindset. It's a shame, really.
---
Completely without any guides or addons. I can't say "blind" because I've played Wrath and I've played on private servers some (up to level 20 or so).
---
This might go against the usual sentiment but I find Vanilla easy. I had absolutely no problem with mobs or finding places or anything. And to be fair, that's how I like it. I don't need it to be "hard". I play games to relax and unwind. Using anything outside the game or leveling addons would just eliminate the fun and make the game a chore.
---
Teldrassil always feels like going home. 
---
Ungoro crater because devilsaurs.
---
You should sell all your crappy leather to vendors for gold before 40 for your first mount, correct.
---
At 60, Devilsaur Leather. It's used in a lot of pre-raid BiS patterns and you can be sure people are going to pay for it. The problem is that Devilsaurs are camped heavily and it's hard to get much of. If you hit 60 early there's less competition, and people who are still levelling are easy to kill 1v1 (most of the time).
---
Keeping some Heavy Leather is fine too. Although I wouldn't farm it too hard, a lot of people will go Skinning.
---
Herbs are worth a lot throughout the entire content cycle, especially AQ/Naxx. The more you get early, even if you sit on it for some time, the better.
---
I am too :D
---
Seems there a lot of #littlechangers here ;-)
---
As long as they preserve the community &amp; the mood that made Vanilla WoW vanilla WoW I'm fine with it.
---
Actaully, more or less sweeping class chances would actually add to the Vanilla mood. The Flavor Class of the Month was awesome to have. Every patch a new class took the spotlight and the meta adjusted accordingly.
---
That's exactly how I felt, but I've never played Shaman before. The Troll racial doesn't seem *that* great but most guides I've seen are like you definitely want to go Troll for PvE.
---
The Tauren positives just seem to outweigh Berserking to me.
---
But what would we call such a device? Something simple, like a smoll creature that can be lured with cheese perhaps?
---
Ahh the classic Error 404
---
Sorry, we can't find the page you are looking for
---
No?
---
Cheers!
---
So does this mean i can have a level 1 bite on a pet while its level 60? but if i tame a pet with lets say level 6 bite, my old pet upgrades to level 6 bite aswell?
---
What if they say "Due to corporate restructuring and changes in the company, we will be putting the development and release of Classic on hold indefinitely"
---
April fools!  not indefinitely, just a very long time...that is all.
---
Lmfao, you think a Hunter has priority on those weapons? Clueless
---
There is no good 1h weapons in mc, they only come in bwl, so a weapon like bonereavers edge from raggy is really good for warriors until they get 2 1h from bwl 
---
yeah, alliance are really missing out in Hinterlands imo since they only get a couple q's and way less jintha'alor q's
---
The only thing I remember from back in Vanilla is that the first time I tried the slam spec I took agro from the tank on Onyxia, so I would say it's a fairly good DPS spec :D
---
We didn't have KTM at the time, so agro management was quite a "confuse" thing (full dps until someone dies :D ).
---
Enjoy classes with a high potential for complexity/finesse. Classes with more to them then hit this cd every time it’s up. Rogue seems the best fit so far with their energy pooling, ability timing but thought I’d get some other opinions.
---
Played resto shaman during actual classic, and while I immensely enjoyed healing, think I’m ready for something else. Played hunter in wotlk and enjoyed that as well, but they seem to play a lot differently in classic.
---
If you think I'm making 60 before phase 2 you have severly over estimated my power.
---
I'm mostly leaning towards the tauren right now. I like the spiritual / nature vibe they have going, so for me that decision really comes down mostly to factors that have nothing to do with gameplay. And they're big, so armour and mounts show off pretty well.
---
It's good to know that raids aren't likely to force certain races though. At the end of the day I'm sure a poorly played min-max combo is a lot worse than anything else that is well played.
---
nice
---
Don't you put that evil on us, Ricky Bobby. 
---
Only thing that has been changed is what abilities are triggered by sitting crits and what are not. The fact that you will be crit when sitting has never changed to this day afaik (I don't have retail).
---
I would call that average at best, on the recent private server we averaged 30 min bwl and even faster mc’s, and aq40 in &lt;1 hour. That means you can clear aq/bwl/mc in roughly 2 hours. All you need is an experienced team who is willing to get world buffs for each raid and all the consumables.
---
Wait, they never said the classic servers were for PC...
---
Oh shit, Mobile Vanilla here we come. 
---
Oh god. 
---
My last guild, I was MT.  Wed have one warrior pull garr and then I’d grab all the adds and tank them up against the wall. Then they’d blow up garr while I used all my cds to stay alive.  It’s been a little while since I did it so can’t remember all the specifics but was good times.
---
What a magical time 😍🥰
---
What does this have to do with Classic????
---
I hadn't even noticed the mana cost yet. Considering how important mana management is for shammies that ability probably won't very often make it to the top of the list of things to cast. I have over the years gotten quite a lot of utility out of the war stomp, I'm a big fan. If nothing else it makes my healing easier as well since a stunned mob doesn't do any damage :P 
---
I was also considering going with herbalism and alchemy, having consumables is probably quite necessary for any healer, so I might as well make my own.
---
Classic has offically been re categorised from soon to. soom tm. 
---
Rather have a resto shaman take it for grinding due to the precedent that shit sets.
---
Literally this. Any answer I could have given is summed up by this comment. Alt+ any of the affore mentioned QWERSZXCRT = almost all your needed spells bound. 
---
When I first make a character on any MMO I rebind just like he said. Then if I know what my "bread and butter" ability I'll open with or use forever with that class js, I always bind that to E or R because they are easy for me to reach up and press
---
A dedicated Twink guild doesn't exist yet I think. 
---
Tanaris
---
I was in a similar situation, and had a really hard time training my left hand to new keybinds. But then I tried something a little different, and it worked well for me. I kept my left hand doing almost all of my movements, and got a mouse with a lot buttons for all of my actions. So now my right hand can almost entirely be focused on actions, while my left hand is mostly focused on movement.
---
as long as hunters understand that the stacking of people with a full T2 set is the pinnacle in terms of raid sets they do fine.
---
Depending on how many you have in a raid they give melee a good run for their money
---
alliance raids usually have more as they are their only source for nature resistance auras
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
You won't be able to roll both. Bye.
---
Brutality Blade is a good weapon. And Phase 1 means we have access to Onyxia‘s Lair with Viskag and Deathbringer too. Even the daggers are considered good fury weapons for non humans/orcs.
---
Nope, no BfA for Classic. Just give them your credit card info and when you open the launcher, click on the WoW classic icon that will be there and viola, you're in
---
What spec shud I play if I want to be a popular addition to a group in off? What is the spec people see and are like ooo I want that in the group?
---
Bankalt
---
How can I keyboard turn if I don't have a keyboard?!?
---
2H fury is a thing. We’ll see how the proc is in classic; that’ll affect how strong it is compared to other options, but it will likely remain the best PvP and PvE weapon for warriors in the MC era and maybe the BWL era and beyond too (other than R14 weapons).  For horde BRE is warrior BiS for a long time, some say into Naxx, because of the armor debuff. Even for alliance it’s extremely strong and more useful on a warrior than on any other class by far. 
---
Use digits you don't normally use.
---
I couldnt get keybindings to work for me. So I bought a naga, now I do everthing with my thumb.
---
Catseye Ultra Goggles are even better than Bloodvine in terms of stealth detection. They give 18+ iirc
---
with 1.12 lupos doesn't deal shadow damage - and he wasn't that amazing to begin with for PvE. All that lupos did was to bypass armor mitigation and dip a bit into stealing warlock debuff stacks (imp shadowbolt)
---
true that, but he will be heavily contested. For starters one of the 1.2 sec attack speed cats or wolves will do the job fine for PvP until he/she gets ol' broken tooth
---
If you can take down Onyxia [with 40 priests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmXZPuS7L0). I wouldn't be surprised if you can take her down with a smaller, properly balanced group.
---
yo, turns out I might have underestimated just how much threat weaponskill provides (especially for non-humans in this case). While Edgemaster's still lack defensive stats, If you desperately need to generate more threat in a fight  they are actually a solid option, though diminishing returns should mean that Human's benefit less from it.
---
its situational
---
the racial is great IF you actually expect rogues around in that moment
---
true, but they lack any form of thats - that was my main reason why I never grew very fond of them.
---
I guess all these years of playing vanilla private servers will pay off as I know all of the quests and path for leveling already, after leveling tons of characters to 60 over the years.
---
Thought is they will announce it this weekend. Normaly the leaks are pretty accurate.
---
Fuck every time I think I have decided on a character I see one more thing to think about that I have completely neglected to consider, I realize its a tiny chance of running into people stacking that much stuff but damn it must be frustrating
---
Your bot isn't going to work in Classic bro
---
Same tactic is used on private servers. Just need to kill the remaining adds 1 by 1 and not take the boss too far from the adds. Tbh, seems like far safer tactic than having adds killing healers when banish ends (if warlocks arent spamming it and having voidwalkers attack it).
---
And you dont need x number of warlocks.
---
The virgin prot tank vs the chad fury tank
---
That's exactly what I do, but if you're planning to PVP and raid you'll probably find some more specialised pets as you go!
---
Horde also has generally better GY locations which actually adds quite alot of comfort.
---
OOH there was a leak about this? Where can i read up on this
---
Daggers can be better than swords early game if your not human. You can get items pre raid that give dagger skill but not sword skill. 
---
Ugh I never got those fucking shoulders. Forever 7/8
---
quest helper is the devil
---
By not putting in the honor system/rank 14 gear soon enough.
---
I'll probably have Joana's guide and Classic DB open on my other screen for references as well.
---
Yes it does mean you can have level 1 bite on a level 60 pet
---
Higher levels of bite require higher amounts of skill points - so you not only need to learn the higher level from an appropriate animal, you need to train your pet in it and have the skill points available to do so. It won't level your old pet up automatically.
---
So he's a pally wearing cloth....sounds just like vanilla to me :P
---
Tarnished elven rings rings? Rogue dm trinket?
---
Lueron did it last year during a raid,

---
Racials are so insignificant in the grand scheme. Play what you think looks cool. You have to stare at this for potentially hundreds of hours
---
Devilsaurs were not camped heavily in Vanilla. They were camping me.
---
The classic League of Legends defence. I'm just having FUN you tryhard. Because losing or generally just being bad at a game is fun for some people, apparently. 
---
This goes heavily into the what if territory
---
because in the what if I fight X territory my call vs other casters is a spellstone to clear roots and all debuffs and to give me a shield - and I can still swap to a staff after I've used it
---
-
---
in general Escape Artist can have a place. But imo it just fills the role of a poor mans free action potion - and nets and the likes all go into that very same box. They will work sometimes, but not when you face someone who is really on tryhard mode
---
But again - that's all in the 'what if' territory. Escape artist caters to one playstyle. Perception to another. Both have their place in the game. As I'm just going to roll one (or multiple ... port slaves need to be leveled too) they will be humans as twinks are always better under the bonus rep boost
---
Post # 1,435,857,985 about this.  Why don't you search it?
---
Pax East is Thurs-Sun
---
By then people will be stuck in Westfall and running away from the game in droves.
---
Hunters can get this after gbank is so full of shards gold no longer matters for any guild member. These are terrible for hunters. Go get your preBiS you lazy noob.
---
These are only viable until the good weapons drop from BWL then they are PVP weapons. Prio is always warriors who PvP.
---
myep and if you tell people now that vanilla was still a workinprogress so its not unlikely to see ChAnGeS they tilt
---
DONT HYPE ME UP WITHOUT A SOURCE ARRRR
---
I'm guessing 8 weeks before launch.  
---
Imagine a 40 man raid with this and no push to talk.
---
Its something about them being at pax east.
---
The tricky part about being a quest completionist is finishing every single quest before they turn gray, which requires careful planning as you juggle multiple quests across several zones at the same time. I’m developing an Alliance Quest Completionist Guide, which is currently complete through level 27.
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
I'm in the same boat. Any good tutorials for beginners who still click?
---
So I'm aware of this mechanic but unsure of the specifics: do you learn, let's say "claw rank 5" the moment you tame that lvl 50 cat? As in, would you just stable your pet, go out and tame a high lvl, **instantly dismiss it**, and be fine to go train your original pet?

Thanks I hate it

*Cries in 7/8 Netherwind*
---
Pressing too many buttons In terms of rotation or in terms of mana? 
---
Youll have to downrank spells and get + healing gear for mana conservation and youll have druids intervating healers here and there to help as well as mana potions but shouldnt be to hard to conserve your mana with pre raid bis. If youre talking specifically rotation/skill required im going to say tanking would be much harder and more gear dependent. 
---
The difference in retail is that there is variable difficulty available, but it is the culture that prevents people from pushing their limits to difficulties that aren't defeated like a speed run. Personally I ran a +21 keystone this past week that took 2.5 hours to clear; brutal but fun.
---
Classic will definitely be a good fit for making the stead pace non-optional for those who enjoy that style.
---
Discipline is pretty rad
---
And how did they not get healing aggro? It’s what, 6 adds? This is bullshit
---
Gotta get those goblin boots
---
It is the reason why the premade BGs usually refer to hunters as a rogues hard counter. Generic rogues just see - oh hunter me sneak up me kill. Because most hunters don't even know that they have tracking skills, nor that they actively increase their detection beyond a red dot on the minimap.
---
The later is also a factor. If a hunter made a successful stealth detect he/she will still see your red dot on the map for up to 9 seconds even after you break LoS (the server ticks for cleanups were 10 seconds so - basically 0-9 seconds of a lingering information where that flare needs to go
---
So you *actually* got in contact with the guy. Mad props for getting Mute on the show!
---
Warlock or Hunter for me, the only thing that keeps me away from rolling hunter is the struggle to tame rare pets against other hunters, especially at the beginning.
---
Start pull with blood rage / battleshout.  Get in the pack and start tabbing threat around.  Challenging shout once garr is pulled away.  Skullflame/force reactive disc also very helpful.  I’m sure you can find videos of others using this strat if you look around.
---
WoW's next xpac moves the entire game to mobile
---
But I doubt that they will have the balls for this right now. Maybe in a year or two
---
You and I have the same dilemma. I'm probably playing alliance rogue again. However IDK if I want to be a human again. Gnomes are just so much better for pvp, and dwarves make hunter/warrior matchups a little less painful. The +sword skill is nice, but PvE/Raiding is such a small part of the game.
---
Winterspring. Because by the time you get there your gear is so underleveled everything is so god damned hard to kill, but you're so close to 60 you can almost taste it. But you're stuck on that stupid yeti fur quest and keep getting ganked, so you eventually say fuck it and try to kill Ursius instead. 
---
It was? Haven't read anything about it. It's a leak so it can always be a fake. But I haven't found the prove for it yet. What's your source?
---
Mage. Its what I played back in vanilla and I'm going to recapture my youth. I loved all of the class fantasy involved, believe it or not. Conjuring food, portals, carrying reagents, POM pyro one shotting noobs in pvp, AOE farming, blinking into secret areas (or using blink to avoid fall damage). Mage was just always so fun to me. 
---
In 20 minutes
---
High health pool, healthstone, soul stone, fears, dots, Voidwalker shield, etc. 
---
The longer a fight goes on, the more it goes in a warlock's favor, and you have a lot of tools to make that happen. 
---
Well that's why I asked, because I didn't know 
---
&gt; Fortunately, Gandalf had that flight path marked.
---
Explains why he told the rest of his party to just fly there.
---
Not gonna lie, even if I was horde, I get the feeling of being home when I see the starting zones from alliance. It was amazing to run around through Teldrassil or Elwynn Forest, and don't get me started on the music...
---
Give up on this one. It was one guy on a forum who'd previously posted a load of bunk information. There's a BFA based PVP panel, that's it.
---
Who said I'll roll a hunter? Calling people a noob because they ask a question is silly 
---
You can launch straight from the wow.exe, however if you use the launcher you bypass having to type in login and authentication code. Thus the launcher is much faster.
---
Nice answer, thank you 
---
Ita a leak.  How can you prove its fake?
---
We should call it a rat!
---
Make a macro that types the spell you want to cast in chat
---
Tanaris was the shit. Its where the game gets real. You hit level 40 and you start to feel strong as your class, you start to see a lot more world pvp, the first dungeons with possinle epic drops call to you, enemy variety surges and shit just generally starts to get real. Not to mention having level capped zones directly adjacent puts level cap in sight. 
---
no engineering smokes?
---
For my money, announcement in April, beta in May/June, release in July. 
---
Or, everything moved up one. I think August is the latest they can release without pissing people off since they've kept quiet about the date so far. 
---
This is so awesome! Can't wait to listen to it! :D 
---
I have no idea why anyone would play a Warlock on Alliance when 25% of the opposite faction has a baked-in counter to your primary form of survivability/CC (fear).
---
geils spiel

Spellcasting
---
C-A-S-T-I-N-G
---
Wow, these are really cool. Like the other removed abilities, I notice that they added them in later expansions. Hunters would be able to provide even more utility with these pet abilities. 
---
Thoughts on a troll mage? Mages are one of the few classes I haven’t spent much time with and if I’m playing horde, I’m prob rolling with troll. Without wotf it will force me to be more inventive with my playing 
---
you think they'll run another beta?
---
A damn shame. 
---
"no but they said they wanted to add it! See it says it right here!" - Any retard ever
---
nope the new pet has to use the skill and you gain the skill to your pet spellbook at some time which I think is RNG based, could be 1 use or 100.
---
The price they pay to min/man.  I don't see a problem with it.
---
It's not a requirement to raid and is just a little extra that is achievable by making sacrifices.  Seems fair to me.
---
I always typed my portal spells since I didn't like the screen clutter addons brought. Even with the cool circular portal location addons. I always got a small sense of satisfaction out of doing it that way. 
---
Nice
---
&gt; Classes with more to them then hit this cd every time it’s up. Rogue seems the best fit so far
---
Rogues are probably THE most cd reliant vanilla class, by far.
---
&gt; energy pooling, ability timing but thought I’d get some other opinions. Will be playing mainly **PvE.**
---
Ah, if you want hardmode pve, play a feral druid. Rogue pve rotation is 3 buttons, with 2 cooldowns on a 2minute timer and a 5minute timer. Most of your dmg comes from auto attacks via keeping Slice n Dice active 100% of the time.
---
Of course it gets pretty gnarly if you're doing speed clears where bosses die in like &lt;20secs or w/e, because every global is needed for something to do insane dmg; very tight windows.
---
Legend has it that Pallys actually had Crusader Strike in beta and their other specs actually functioned.  Then one of the devs with a hardon for warriors had it removed.

I remember using them for something, but not Garr. Think because the adds circled around him too fast for it to help.
---
you use WASD to move
---
you use Q/E/R/G/C/V/X/F etc as keybinds as well as 1-2-3-4
---
you then make keybinds using Shift - Q / Shift - R / Shift 1/2/3/4 etc
---
all can be reached while keeping your hands on WASD

---
There's almost no way they don't run some sort of public beta to stress test everything properly.  They may not run a very long one, but I can't see any scenario where they're moving a 14 year old game to an entirely new frame work and backend and DO NOT do some sort of public test.
---
First off they are in T1/T2 gear mattets alot 
---
Second the problem in onyxia p3 is healing for a 20man group as wanding p1 is the basic tactics. 
---
Thirdly shadow dps actually is decent when it comes to group healing. (% damage Done is hps). 
---
Fourth. I soloed onyxia at lv80 as a caster shaman, that doesn’t mean 20man at lv60 can do it. 
---
Fifth if you look at that video. Because I played a priest in wow you will notice the mt is in high stamina gear in shadow form and can spend his tp without care for threat.  And using flask.  
---
It’s the same problem when rouges say they are good tanks as they can mt nef.  No they have high enough hp to not be 1shotted and high enough incoming hps to top them off.  Aka good healers.  
---
You can have a look [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=107;0;struck). You´re welcome.
---
If they were intended to do all content as main tanks, which we can at least assume they were due to talents etc. Then why did Blizzard never really go and fully balance them and tweak them throughout vanilla? Lack of time?
---
I would have farmed that stupid chromatic sword from that stupid basilisk because its one of the most expensive items in the game now.
---
Hunter has one of the most "involved" rotation in Vanilla.
---
Rogue is not that demanding imo.
---
&gt;The global cooldown timer has been added to all spells and abilities.
---
Blizzard really needs to stop implementing their April Fools entries a few years down the line.
---
Everything is really good advice but I would t recommend unbinding space bar. I do however recommend using control and shift space as a bind as it’s super easy and convenient to use. I Personally use shift space for my fire ward and ctrl space for my frost ward 
---
They can get the dwarfen ones.
---
I had mine back in classic.
---
But yeah can't get the striders.
---
Please explain why a hunter would want a weapon with +strength and weapon skill. 
---
Or a weapon with a chance on hit. 
---
Lol can you actually set up an alexa so that this works?
---
Not like you have a lot of alternatives. Generally you want to do one of two things to a Hunter pet, CC it or kill it. 9/10 times you opt for CC.
---
Curse of Weakness just happens to be a little bit more effective against Broken Tooth than most pets because his base damage is lower to compensate for him having the fastest attack speed.  
---
Curse of Weakness [reduces damage dealt by a flat amount](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=11708), which is most useful against claws, daggers and some pets like Broken Tooth because they have lower damage but attack much more quickly.
---
I'm excited to lead and participate n WPvP as a Warlock.
---
I learned this on mate mage in wsg when I was a weeeee lad:
---
Always sheep twice. By the time they hit the button to break the cc you already have another halfway lined up and they can't break
---
Apply this to fear. Once we get sexcoil it's even better
---
Take me like a lvl 30 in STV
---
At the base, you still want to change the game just for your own selfish interest, when it's been well known that this is an attempt at a total recreation of vanilla.  
---
I've suggested changes in the past, but I'm happy to say that I fully understand the intent of the developer and yield my selfish desires to the developer's goals of authenticity 
---
&gt;unbound S so I can't walk backwards
---
But what do you do when you're fishing and your cast repeatedly lands on the far side of the school and you need to back up just a little bit?
---
Yeah I figured you just fear it
---
Going from memory. Early some quests pick ups along the way  and following the grind route that is still burned into the back of my head from the good old days. Even dug up the old audio dramas that kept me going back in the day.
---
Aside from a handful of exceptions questing isn't faster than grinding when you can secure a good spot with plenty of alternatives around. Stranglethorn will be a battlefield even among the 'try hard go fast' people and shimmering flats/searing gorge will most likely be one as well
---
Popup respawn zones. I'll be back. \*sounds of dying critters intensify\*
---
not looking forward to double leveling ingie again. Was a pain in the butt, is going to be one again. But gnome is simply pointless post the BoP crafts and the world shrinker doesn't stack with noggenfogger in 1.12 anymore
---
I Love the whole Buddhist/Lewt/Mahiko series.
---
As a 1600-rated rogue at the time I was so blown away by the shit he was doing!
---
Neilyo had some real technical shit too, but it didn't have the same spirit to it...
---
If I get the bindings and Blizzard actually nerfs reliable gold farming like people want, I'm sure as hell dropping money on gold.
---
It's a lot harder for a rogue to beat a warlock, than it is for a warlock to beat a rogue. Unless the rogue is using engineering + other gimmicky gadgets and able to predict your moves, you should win most fights.
---
Gnomergan city ransom?
---
Those aren’t rare mobs. Rare mobs are like the silithid harvester in the barrens, the Wyvern in 1k needles, vultros in West fall etc. some rare mobs do hit like trucks, have fast attack speed, unique abilities etc.
---
I remember back in vanilla wow on one of my first characters as an undead lock I saw a rare mob duskbat in trisifal. He had a fucking 6 second silence and roasted me. I made a hunter and sought out to tame him Bc of that silence and yeah found out he doesn’t bring the silence with him once tamed. Depressing moment for me as I spent awhile doing that. Deleted both chars. 
---
My lil parrot buddy likes low fat cheese. How about we call it a parrot?

kEeP yOuR sHiT oUt Of ThE cOnVeNtIoN
---
Waiting until all rebuffs and stuff are on you then hitting that spell stone and speed pot ftw. God I loved my warlock in vanilla
---
Unlikely. The Defias story in Westfall back in Classic was actually pretty neat and would likely keep people’s attention. Plus the leveling stuff was, iirc, not as bad at that point. (That came around level 40, again iirc) Then after that you may be high enough leveled to go into Duskwood which had several phenomenal quest chains and was pretty well done in general. Beyond that... yeah probably, but by then you would expect it to be a week or two into Shadowbringer’s actual launch. 
---
\&gt; it's trendy to hate on pservers for some reason
---
Yes, the pserver community who takes every possible opportunity to shit on both original vanilla players and retail players are finding themselves with few friends outside of their own community. Color me surprised.
---
Yeah what you need to do is check a database for which pets have an upgraded version of bite, stable your pet, go find/tame the new pet with the upgraded ability, run around and kill mobs a bit until the message pops up about how the skill is teachable, then abandon and go back to your main pet and give him the skill
---
In the case of Broken Tooth specifically Curse of Weakness is so effective that you can get away with not CCing it a lot of the time.
---
That's pretty much not the case for any other pet.
---
&gt; Apply this to fear.
---
Except that will of the forsaken also gives a 5 second immunity to fear, it's not just a fear removal
---
I really wanted to play a Dwarf Hunter cause I love the guns they use but I was told that guns are shit later in game and their stats are no match for bows, is this true? I also wanted to check out mages but I cant decide between a mage or a warlock since they both seem pretty cool.
---
You will fare better at everything except raiding as a hunter.
---
Be one of the few first hunters of your server and take your raid spot before anyone else.
---
1 Naga or mmo mouse. 
---
2 Consider player healer and setting up clique on raid/party frames. Hundreds of combinations of clicks (shift, alt, shift+alt, etc). Keybind your offensive abilities as you will have much fewer actions offensively as a healer and will be much easier to learn to train your left hand to key. 
---
Wow okay didnt know this, do you have a Link to such a DB?
---
I'd say lvl to 5/6 then hop on the zep to duratar. Not that bad rly, could have been worse like tauren/undead. Thats a long walk right there
---
There are none of your favorites vanilla mage races : human, gnomes, trolls UD that's it.
---
The closest thing I found was [Holy Strike](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=10333), but it acts more like a heroic strike than Crusader Strike.
---
Really tempted to play Hunter but also would like to raid. What I've heard is that hunters have one of the (if not the) hardest times finding a raid spot. Can anyone speak on this and what they expect for hunters grouping for raids? 
---
Can do it at 1 if you really want, without *too* much hassle.
---
&gt; I was told that guns are shit later in game and their stats are no match for bows, is this true? I
---
It's true, but you can use the bows/crossbows anyways so you are losing nothing rolling a dwarf on alliance, unless you really want to use only guns.
---
so pretty much get to brill, then go do the razor hill quests/island quests?
---
By late game, you main a crossbow unfortunately.
---
Troll has the rest racial for raidings tho
---
I played a warlock do I never paid attention to Hunter pets. Were they all normalized after 1.12? Like all wolves have the same attack speed/armour/health, all owls are the same, all bears slightly more tanky, etc.? 
---
Aug. 26, 2019 is the release date! 
---
Do u remembet the rogue quest to kill oozes in aszhara and to kill the green dragons in ST? Forgot the name
---
You need to take deep wounds in order to take impale anyway.
---
Honestly if you aren’t trying out for a Method type guild and still perform enough to not hinder your group, it doesn’t matter.
---
If you can click and play decent and have fun, who cares.
---
That's interesting and good to know! 
---
If the estimation is correct that they will release classic 'phases' as filler for retail droughts ... then there may be some bad news here for our succubus spanking friends
---
The original guild wars was like this. You had one bar and had to set it before leaving for a mission. 
---
&gt; I have tried keybinds, but it was so much slower for me at the beginning. Like learning to type, it takes a lot of practice and muscle memory before it will be faster.
---
As you already said, it'll eventually be faster. Trust me, once you stop clicking you'll never want to come back to it
---
You should go to The Barrens when you're done with Tirisfal Glades. Silverpine Forest, while cool, doesn't have the amount of quests the barrens has and is slower to level in compared to the barrens and all of its neighboring zones. 
---
Also goblin sapper charge.
---
You just have to stop cliclking and practice the binds. There's really no tutorial to this.
---
You need to grind rep to unlock a "Chromie Gnomie" allied race, instead of Heritage Armor you get Classic at 120.
---
Most likely Wolf for raid, owl for 5mans and solo world farming with a windserpent for splitpulling stuff if that still works
---
you mouse turn and strafe like a pro
---
I did quite a bit of everything with all sorts of specs. I was specced to survive as a pvp healer for awhile and then to shadow priest for grand marshal grind. Eventually switching to holy for naxx healing but i would still pop into pug BGs and whisper whatever dps I felt worthy and say ‘Healbot incoming’. I loved the feeling of being a guardian angel, I made a lot of friends with some awesome people that way. 
---
My brain interpreted the title as a man named Beacon of Hope with a large penis had been set up for a crime he didn’t commit. 
---
I wonder that nobody noticed that Blizzard didn't make any announcement since Blizzcon. There were a little blue posts in the official forum last days and a couple interviews. That's all. Yeah for us this information was quite interesting and important but not for the mass players. I mean there is still no hype for the casual players. No news in the launcher, no more Dev watercoolers. If you are not reading reddit or an official forum you are still in an information vacuum about Classic.
---
For me this mean 2 options:
---
1. They would not hype Classic for the mass like they do with BfA or other addons. Because Classic will be quite a different part of they are business model. They don’t expect to get a lot of profit from this project and decided to make it just for “true fans” with the authentic conception.
---
2. We are close to the big update.
---
That’s why Warlocks need that stun trinket more than any class. 
---
Okay, but hunter t2 pieces will eventually drop and there won't be load of hunters per raid.
---
Not entirely sure.  I'd have to test it.
---
I'll probably honestly only end up with NE, Orc, and Troll hunters.  
---
I plan on making two characters. A mage because I can farm and I have never had a lot of gold in my years of playing.
---
A warrior so I can tank and see all the dungeons (maybe raids) I didn't get to see before TBC. I can basically make my own groups quickly and I feel I will be more involved in fights and learn them quicker. I have a far off hope of starting a small guild and I'll MT 10 mans and 20's. Very unlikely I would be able to run a 40 man raiding guild.
---
Good point. I was also undead sorry forgot to say that and didn't think about the wotf counter 
---
welp team blue is still going to charge up there for a certain mallet ;)
---
I did this with portal and teleporting on my mage until they broke it in legion with northrend dalaran and broken island dalaran.
---
I'll probably do this in classic.
---
Not sure about alexa but this is absolutely possible to do assuming you have a decent microphone and the speech recognition algorithm is decent, you could bind a key that isn't preferable to reach to a spell and then have a program automatically press the key once a keyword is recognized, if configured correctly in small words i could actually see this providing at least a slight advantage if you don't already have additional mouse buttons.
---
I think we'll get the date in less than a month now. It's almost April.
---
I am hyped af.
---
If you’re speedrunning, it’s probably better to take a new pet every few levels. 
---
Well no, wearing gear for example is more op. You'll see "mc cleared with everyone naked" before you'll see "look we did this raid 2x slower but with no consumables".
---
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER NAXX?
---
you should reconsider troll. unless you want to play holy all the time and focus on pve only its the better choice.
---
I heard there was a rumor (very, very flimsy rumor) that they would announce the date sometime at PAX. 
---
Take it with the smallest grain of salt, though. I doubt we'll hear anything til April at the earliest.
---
I wish they kept the pet abilities that weren’t a form of cc. Skills like web are obviously way too op to have, but the counterattack skill for crocs would’ve been cool and maybe make players try our various pets more. 
---
There's a lot of wiggle room in raids since they are 40man my dude. If anything I'd say Mages would probably have more competition for raid spots since I believe they are gonna be the most played ranged dps.
---
Because you are such a casual ! :O
---
At 10-12 you can head to Org then Razor Hill and grab Conscript of the Horde then head to Xroads.
---
Warriors &gt; pallies &gt; prot offspec warriors &gt; disenchant &gt; hunters
---
Or because your comment wasn't clear in its meaning
---
Well, I don't see it personally. Maybe a bit of anger towards the easy and fast LFR mindset of some retail players but for the most part I see private servers players using their fresh experience to help and answer people asking questions around here. I value their experience a lot more than my vague memories from 2006 personally.
---
On the other-hand I see a lot of know-it-all veterans taking any opportunity to shit on private servers because they have some kind of inferiority complex or something. And most of them have very strong opinions based on partial memories from 2006 (like myself) and are wrong more often than not. Saying "private servers are wrong" and "this or that will be much harder" is just wishful thinking. Nobody knows to what extend private servers are wrong and how it's going to affect the Classic experience. Nobody.
---
But you're probably right, they must be all evil and toxic because they play on pirate servers after all. Bad, bad people.
---
Skarm is a great person, but I don't think he understand what he's going to do to the huge amount of people who don't optimize for these parts of the game.
---
This is even with him being clear that furyprot should only be used if your group can destroy a boss in a very short time.
---
I have a feeling this is going to lead a to a bunch of "i'm a furyprot main" Style of tanks and it's going to be annoying.
---
flurry is of little relevance, majority of fury scaling comes from their flat 25% damage increase, which they can keep at 100% abusing /sit.
---
Hunters, Warlocks and Mages.
---
I did many 1vN fights on my destro lock back then.
---
I played a prot warrior in vanilla-wrath. Mining was always a primary income source for me. Thorium/Arcane crystals always proved to be nearly as efficient for me as DM:tribute runs. Obtaining rare patterns for your professions early is also a good strat, but that requires the gold to buy them to start. The other thing I did was flip things on the AH constantly. Not so much "items" but mats. Buy up all of the silver ore on the AH and relist it. Buy up the stacks of thorium and split them down into smaller more expensive groups. If someone can buy up the 5 thorium they need for say 6g, they may buy that over buying 20 for 15g. Or idealy the full stack will be relisted at 24g.
---
I had some guide or magazine of some sort that my mom bought me awhile ago while the game was out and I remember seeing all of these skills that weren’t in the game. I think it was like a beta strategy guide and this skill was in there. I wish I still had that shit but my family sold the house I grew up in back in 2011 and I thought I was done with wow until you fuckers drew me back in with vanilla servers in 2014. 
---
I'm imagine paladins in PvP with this lol "Alexa, cast divine shield. Alexa, cast hearthstone"
---
I think it's a US thing. I'm so glad that we won't have to share servers with them. 
---
I hear that the various spawned creatures you can create with engineering scale with engineering level. So they are effectively 3 levels higher than any other race's engineering pets when all is maxed.
---
If it's an item, the command is /use (item)
---
Personally what I've seen warriors do is do the dire maul mining farm with a healer, farm raid mats (notably elemental fire/earth), or fish which can net you 50+g/hour
---
Cover more AV :)
---
tbh the amount of stealth detection you can get without the human racial is a pretty strong argument for it being useless. Not like goggles + felhunter + catseye potion is gonna need the limited active ability on top of it.
---
I played a human warlock in Vanilla. It wasn't "pointless," but boy was it frustrating. 
---
&gt; How cool would it be if they said “classic is now released, enjoy!!” But we all thought it was an April fools joke so we carried on with our day.
---
Silly OP, don't you know? On April Fools day if the developers announce that *anything* is ready to play you *definitely* need to play it, because even if it's not Classic it will still be something and that something will be interesting enough for a day of play.
---
&gt; I would like is to be able to ride a wolf
---
Do the PVP mounts have race restrictions?  I swear I remember my Tauren Shammy riding the Black War Raptor and Frostwolf Howler.
---
\*machinima
---
May I ask you where did you use to mine those crystals primarily? 
---
Hey! Join Discord, it's great place to find Classic enthusiasts :)
---
A lot of the time on my human warlock, paranoia would allow me to see a rogue walking by, and I wouldn't be able to target and dot before he was gone again. Popping perception in that situation was almost always a winner. 
---
The problem is, playing a human warlock, almost every rogue I went against was undead, making fear frustrating.
---
God I hope they don’t even joke like that. Playable Void Elves are the absolute worst decision.
---
should have* had
---
Doesn't matter that much, threat is still very limiting horde side, by warlock (who can always go all in on threat if they want) and fury warriors. And I wasn't talking about tranquil air. 
---
Was that the one where they said VanCleef would start saying “Hey You Guys!” In VC?
---
Nobody ever asks How is Mankrik’s wife...  
---
Because we all know she is dead.
---
Because you also (mainly, in theory) play such a game for the simple sake of it, the fantasy and the personal way you identify yourself in it.
---
I've never played warlock before, but I know for sure I am gonna roll among other things a human warlock. I've never thought about racials in the slightest.
---
Not everyone cares about minmaxing.
---
Just go immediately. It's literally a zep ride and a run through one of the smallest zones in wow. Plus min maxxers do this even without having someone to level with as the level 1-10 quests give amazing rep with that faction
---
Hey! I'm pretty new to this Discord thing, I'm used to TS3 - took a long break from WoW, lol. Any channel you'd recommend?
---
How come? I think they're awesome and it's nice having high elves back in Alliance :)
---
Given the current BfA story... people would actually believe that one though.
---
Saw Mute had been commenting on that videos! What a legend
---
This. They will see a massive spike in subs
---
“Thunderstrike now has a 100% drop rate”
---
Stay in Tirisfal until level 9 and grab [The Power to Destroy…](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=5725) before going to Durotar.
---
This is great, I look forward to listening back to all of these.
---
3 hour Wailing Cavern is a blast, some people don't like it but I say fuck them, it's a dungeon, it should take a while!
---
Ye :)
---
Just levelled on a pserver so I'll mostly just grind anything else is inefficient
---
Dire maul east. Farming lashers.
---
Or dm-n tribute runs. For the world buffs before raiding.
---
Hell ya, totally forgot about 19 twinks! What patch was it where they changed the brackets? I am pretty sure it the original brackets were 11-20, 21-30 etc..
---
I had an awesome 20 twink and when they changed the brackets I was heart broken.
---
I don't think classic wow is competing with expansions for new games, really. Blizzard already stated they are only allocating a small team to this project and don't see it as a profitable venture other than bringing in a few thousand old subscriptions.
---
So this makes me doubtful that they've planned around the summer solstice and the soon to follow FF expansion. They dropped hints around July 16th pretty explicitly though
---
This is a very minor and specific thing but
---
Soloing a quest that requires you to enter a cave. Remember how tightly packed those mobs are? Or how high their Aggro range is? Or if you pulled 2 it was an immediate death sentence(or if you won 1v2 you felt godly)?
---
I enjoyed i guess the tactical aspect of mapping your route and calculating the best way to navigate the cave. Always fun to me. 
---
I actually undershot my estimate.  Undead are actually somewhere around 40% of Horde on most servers.  That sucks butt for Alliance Warlocks.
---
Yes, but we Americans will get to raid BWL nice and snug under blankets
---
I really want to play shadow priest, how difficult do you think it will be to get a spot in a raid? 
---
It‘s a „one off“ spec, right? 
---
If it doesn‘t work out, i can switch to healing for PvE, but that‘s not the goal. 
---
yep!
---
Yeah good question but I assume their priorities were elsewhere. There's a lot of unfinished content in vanilla that blizzard never got around to finishing until later expansions. Class balance they never really got right as far as tanking until wotlk where druids and paladins were truly viable tanks in every raid for every encounter. as far as i remember, even in TBC warriors were still the best tanks - correct me if I am wrong though.
---
Use mouse ;P
---
Or bind walk backwards to some obscure key just for this purpose.
---
It would be cool if they had a trailer for a Classic Mobile game and then at the end they had a release date for it, but that was the real release date for classic wow. 
---

It's got TBC stuff there, but you can just ignore that. Makes finding the right pet to tame to get new skills a breeze.
---
gutted
---
You do you.  Just know you're signing up for a steeper than normal uphill climb in PVP.
---
when I first played vanilla (around WoD launch) I honestly thought this is how heal classes would downrank their spells in raids, with spellbook open all the time lmao
---
Why?  It is a bona fide business service.   The reseller of these items puts in time and tries to exchange that time for money.  If he charges too much, people will undercut him and customers won't buy his wares. If the price stays too high, people will instead make the journey to the  npc vendor themselves. 
---
I am always happy to buy stuff like 1st aid books and various random cooking or crafting recipes conveniently in the city  as long as the added price tag is reasonable.

Was Liquid Ice in Enmity? I uploaded his 1st &amp; 2nd PvP videos to my Youtube.
---
Alexstrasza is neither a human or a warlock
---
Smart.  A high skill player wouldn't pop their CC breaker when they see you're queuing up a new one, but most normies (myself included) wouldn't be patient enough.
---
bois that will get you going in the morning
---
&gt;they must be all evil and toxic
---
You sure nipped that myth in the bud.
---
I don't think it's a minor thing at all!  Definitely a big aspect of the game that added a lot of difficulty and, more importantly, forethought required as to how you approached your targets - instead of just facerolling through said cave the way it has been for many years.  
---
Definitely a tactical element that has been lost over the years which I am looking forward to again :)
---
except they're not really high elves
---
Yes! This right here. Recognizing people who have helped you or who you have helped. Seeing them further along in the game. This is something I'm really looking forward to.
---
The Blizzcon demo wasn't really a beta - they need to properly test a LOT more than just dumping everyone into two zones at level 15. 
---
Tauren's should have gotten an ability simmilar to cannabalize but can only be used over grass called grazing. Change my mind
---
The only gun which is good is a AQ40 drop (Larvae), but it is slightly worse than a BWL crossbow (Ashjre'thul). Aside both these weapons raid-wise you can expect Rhok'delar (quest from a item dropped in  MC, a bow) and the actual BiS Nerubian Slavemaker, a crossbow dropped by the very last boss in the game. Even the best pre-raid options are crossbows. 
---
   Already cleared out the demon cave but I missed Foreman Thazz'ril's pick, so I'm going back for it      before leaving the Valley Of Trials. Going back for the second round, now      at level 6 and with Fireball (Rank 2), I felt so powerful.
---
* Autoattack in keybind 1.
---
* Apparently I had discovered that you can add additional      action bars, though.
---
* No buff durations displayed.
---
It was glorious.
---
What a glowing review! This game sounds like it might be a success
---
Bwahaha, good contribution take my upvote
---
Gaming mouse for sure. I have small hands so anything outside 1-4 is clunky for me to hit, but having extra mouse buttons is a game changer. Honestly once you get used to binds you will never imagine going back to clicking.
---
They intended on it, but sadly decided to delay the changes to Burning Crusade. At least, this was the explanation for not adding the Paladin's taunt on a previous podcast.
---
Because random forums posts aren't "leaks" if nothing's actually been leaked. By that definition Smash Ultimate had about 10 new "leaks" a day. 
---
The poster was a troll and Blizzard are only at PAX to talk about BFA. I'd love to be wrong on that, but nah.
---
honestly i wouldn't necessarily associate maces with some hunter-gatherer nature worshiping society inspire by native american. it fits human more. medieval stone builders. if we fantasize about it taurens could have had staffs speciliazation. 
---
They are all over the world, various random npc's often have 1 or 2 recipes  for sale.  It could be a cook, or a blacksmith or a reagents vendor. You can research this in any vanilla database or just make it a habit to check every vendor once you play the game and make notes. 
---
Classic Warlords of Draenor
---
I just meant abilities in total, all totems plus other abilities. Warrior has a simpler rotation and a lot less abilities to hotkey etc 
---
There are some conspiracy theories on the forums, stemming from here actually, that make July 16th seem pretty believable.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/
---
There's also this guy suggesting July 16th for more logical reasons, and another guy later in the thread suggesting the same day for entirely different reasons:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/i-think-i-know-when-classic-will-launch/134198
---
Roger that chief thanks 👍
---
Well, they did balance it, look up druids armor. It got buff quite hard. 
---
Did they admit to be a troll? Its a rumor but his was it proven to be fake?
---
What is the podcast called on Spotify I cant find it
---
0:47:45
---
Hints for July 16th? They did?
---
Make the switch while you're leveling.  That way by the time you need to group, you'll be used to it.
---
Yes, that was his point.
---
Yes?
---
I'm just pointing out the detail that class distinction will change over the phases. I'm not saying it's bad or good.
---
the problem is that these poor lvl 1 buggers have to run back to a mailbox and then back again to their watchpost every time you want to sell some of their obtained wares. they also need some gold with them to be able to buy the recipes multiple times over a period of time because you certainly don't want to make the trip every day.  So all in all it's quite some work, do if you pull it off I say  you deserve any profit you make 
---
Resolution is too high for 2005, mate.
---
I clicked spells from my spellbook the first 12 levels on my first day in vanilla. Once I saw I could drag abilities onto the bar I had pikachu face.
---
He mentions that aspect in the podcast actually. He said it was a mistake on the team responsible for the actual number crunching aspect to.
---
Definitely this. On a pserver, any rushed dungeons I’ve been a part of have fallen apart very quickly each time. It absolutely won’t be the norm to “speed run” anything 
---
And it was always 1 power tripping guy with leader (usually a dps) who finds their way into my ignore list 
---
On the right panel you have Classic WoW discord channel - install Discord desktop app and click the link, it'll open Discord and connect you to the channel. You can use Discord for both chatting and voice communcation
---
classic wow has to be released, so I can stop making shitty memes.
---
The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000 remains my favourite southpark episode , if you are old enough to remember that one.....   if not, go watch it some day :D
---
The low level maces/ wooden ones look more tribal from the land. There are plenty of native American maces/hammers. Also never getting the fighting totems as weapons in vanilla too. 
---
From my experience finishing Deathknell or Valley of Trials takes about 30 minutes. That would be the first sensible point of merging, unless the servers are a complete mess where players are spawn camping mobs (no sharding and a popular server). In that case it would be best to gather up at level 1. But in normal cases complete your starting are and meet up in Razor Hill and start with the quests there.
---
Yes. I often yelled out “this sucks butt!” when some undead rogue broke my fear. Heh. 
---
So the best gun in the game is way worse than the best crossbows, thus making a gun hunter usesless ?
---
its 1024 x 768, what are you talking about?
---
"should have", not "should of"
---
Yeah, I did not play in beta, so I can't confirm or deny from personal experience.  I am, however, a pretty die hard pally player, and have heard/read this story in multiple places.   That's why I referred to it the way I did.
---
*That's* the part you loved?
---
If you're arms or fury, SM farming is OK money (it's what I did).
---
If you're prot, try to find a rich guild and be the MT ;-)
---
Mining was not profitable for me, there was too much competition and repop was quite long iirc.
---
I'm speaking real Vanilla not pserver here.
---
I honestly hope I'm not going to have to go back to making a /cancelform macro for every spell I want to cast from Druid forms.
---
&gt;spammy rotations lets you multitask irl ;)
---
Are you fapping while raiding?
---
I know theirs one in alterac and on in Winterspring. I'll just go check recipes on the DB thanks
---
Yes, someone else already corrected my bad grammar. It's not something I excel at. 
---
Tauren can't ride raptors... it's the only reason I never roll tauren :(
---
Yea, Tall Striders especially would be interesting as a support/utility pet.
---
&gt; All of their classes available use mace as well, unlike humans (mage and lock)!
---
Hunter’s can’t use maces. 
---
Well if they try to be smart and just sit the sheep then the initial plan of sheeping them just worked even better because the first sheep is longer. Either they trinket and sit the next half sheep or they don't trinket and sit a full one.
---
Logitech g600. Dont buy garbage razer shit. 
---
Yeah exactly.  I helped him because I was taken under someone's wing countless times leveling up.  Being gifted 6 slot bags, potions, food, was all too common. 
---
The hippy sippy did stop a bit at 60, but leveling up with people, seeing the guy you hate in a bg, damn you Cherrybobbins!, It was fun.
---
Having regular customers for your cooldown craftables.  You'd make plans to meet if you were in a rush for the mats, because, you didn't want to wait that extra hour.
---
I remember seeing see the first rank 14 guy in my realm, undead warrior, chilling out near ironforge.  He waved at me, I waved back, we danced a little, but he eventually Crit me to hell and back.  Which led to little wars.  Level 20's throwing out heals to lvl 60's, those same lvl 20's dying from a lvl 60 imp, or a blizzard.
---
Fuck I'm old lol
---
Basically: Druids didn't work out as intended and didn't get fixed until after vanilla. Not what I expected. Kind of cooled me on the idea of maining a Druid. 
---
I thought that the joke of "it's a hunter weapon" extended into them being able to use all weapons, my mistake and til.
---
Dont buy a naga. Razer is garbage. But a logitech g600
---
WoW mobile game? 
---
I don't agree, when you tame a new pet you have to constantly feed it to keep it tamed and with each loyalty level you get more training points so if you really want to max its damage and survivability plus save money on pet food sticking with one pet is ideal. To get new pet abilities you only need to use that new ability a few times to add it to your spell book so its not much wasted time at all.
---
I don’t want to change your mind, change my mind!
---
I will choose the realm my guild is playing on. That makes sense to me ;)
---
eeuh,  1024x800 existed in 1992.  I am sure 13 years later they had moved to something better.  1280 × 1024 and 1600x1200 was certainly possible in Vanilla Wow
---
If you’re gonna raid super cerealy, groups just bring 1 Shadow Priest. If you wanna raid more casually most groups won’t care 
---
The chances are 24.6% 
---
fire or frost, make up your damn mind, mage! 
---
Well what's on your mind? 
---
8-bit version of BWL.
---
I for one wont be playing if they have phasing after launch. And i really hope im on a server with no popular streamer.  
---
Think about this, it's usually only one spriest per raid of 40. That's 2.5% of the raid. Whereas warrior/shamans can have up to 8, that's 20% of the raid. Not only that but you may go 31 points into holy or disc and not be real shadow because shadow Mana usage is god awful
---
Actually I kind of agree as it would make then more viable and not considered a troll pick by hardcore people. 
---
&gt; To get new pet abilities you only need to use that new ability a few times to add it to your spell book so its not much wasted time at all.
---
Yeah, but don’t forget you have to store your pet, run to a new pet area, tame a new pet, fight some stuff, abandon pet, run back, and retrieve your old pet. 
---
Shockadin is a healer first. Your combo of judge, shock, hammer of wrath is great for finishing off opponents quickly, that’s it. Pocket heal your dps friend, coordinate CCs then pop out 2k dmg in 1.5 second. You have 30 secs of little damage at best. Hammer is an amazing execute for fleeing enemies. Don’t think you will be doing much for damage. 
---
If you don’t want to be a healer roll ele sham and pew pew. 
---
Every raid will want at least 1 shadow priest, as long as you're consistent you should be able to find a guild or raid group. 
---
I dunno, I mean some of those theories make some sense. For instance, it would make sense that Blizzard would fear that there'd not be enough players to heal, thus every class that could heal did so in raiding. Kevin Jordan dispelled that, but I could see it. 
---
Additionally, I think Kevin Jordan makes a lot of things more clear to me and that the balance of classes at patch 1.12 was entirely a contingency. It was entirely a result of things going on at that time and was never considered by Blizzard then as a finished product. He said that if BC wasn't around the corner and there were going to be more vanilla patches, warrior dps would have been nerfed and they'd take a pass at buffing some super bad specs like Prot Paladin and Balance Druid. 
---
well, account 1 will take ~120 hours to level.
---
My goal is to have the 9 characters at the nearest inn / mailbox to their intended vendor by the time my main's at level 30. So if I can get 1 toon to his location every 2.5 hours, I'll be set once my main has a sizable first chunk of gold to send to each of them.
---
The goal is to fund each with enough gold for 10x their intended wares by level 40 or so. Should keep return runs for the out of the way vendors to a minimal. And most of this is an early investment that I don't plan on cashing in for several weeks.
---
Go for it! It may take a few times to get it down, but definitely worth it, 10- 20g per run
---
If that were the case, if they were to add a post-1.12 new balance update to address original intentions, could people really be that upset? 
---
Kevin Jordan has said it was time, but also toward the end of the expansion, with Burning Crusade around the corner, they held off on a lot of ideas until the expansion. Of course, in the expansion, pretty much every spec in the game is viable and lots of specs have great support niches like Elemental Shaman.
---
I think it's super important to think of class balance @ 1.12 as a contingency of that moment. It was entirely a result of things going on at that time and was never considered by Blizzard then as a finished product. He said that if BC wasn't around the corner and there were going to be more vanilla patches, warrior dps would have been nerfed and they'd take a pass at buffing some super bad specs like Prot Paladin and Balance Druid.
---
Showing up on time consistently and prepared will matter more than spec for the majority of guilds except for the real cutting edge. As other posters have mentioned, there's 40 spots to fill and for the most part dps is dps, a mage that doesn't show up each week or is late or doesn't come prepared is a worse choice than a hunter who is prepped and ready to go on time every time.  
---
But if BC content is what happens after Naxx, then it's not a bad idea. 
---
Yeah fair, when I go through leveling (although I am not focused on speed running) I simply do some research and pick a few key beasts to tame to get new pet skills. For example I won't get every rank of Claw, I'll just get every other one if the animal isn't too far out of my way. 
---
You can just have a hunter kite the adds while everyone kills garr
---
Hello, we would love to have you. You can talk to me on discord guild channel. https://discord.gg/SsKH6rX
---
Our raid schedule will be a democracy. I am Yoko on the server so I'll talk to you then.
---
Yup. I had 2 60s and vanilla and even I want them to eventually make changes to the game like they intended. I've always considered BC a mistake, despite it being fun, because of the trajectory it placed WoW in. Arena, flying, dailies, linear dungeons, making Azeroth obsolete, etc. My ideal Classic would be one that continues in the original path they intended before conceptualizing BC. 
---
I went with whatever would run on my Windows XP desktop (Insignia)... (:
---
Yeah was my kinda shower thought this morning along the same lines. Looking at the distribution of class/race graphs that was recently posted helped push the thought.
---
 I went with whatever would run on my Windows XP desktop (Insignia)... (: 
---
This is correct and as far as I know the only advantage at lvl 60.
---
but before lvl 60 it's pretty nice to get stuff easier and earlier.  However this is more advantageous for a 2nd alt, because for your first character you won't  be able to max out engineering  because your level is lower than the profession skill . Example: at lvl 35 you can train 225-300, but you will need mithril and thorium etc ,  resources you won't ever be able to find at lvl 35.   The same goes for lvl 20 and iron ore etc. 
---
not having wotf just means you're gonna get feared an extra time. The zerker racial for trolls is sick on mages.
---
They might run a closed beta like with other expansions but no chance open beta happens.
---
I ended up going fire!
---
On the 10k+ Classic survey it showed that the majority of people were in favor of future Vanilla content. The purists are a vocal minority, and shrinking as time goes on.
---
I loved this quest. First quest I had a "woah" moment. At the time it was a difficult quest, because it wasn't obvious where I needed to be and how to get there. So having finally found my way of this fairly hidden objective made it feel exclusive. Not to mention that view when you finally get up on the rock.

You can pretty much guarantee to avoid big steamers if you roll on a pvp server. Sharing has been discussed more than anything here, and I think  most of us aren’t worried because blizzard’s direction so far has been desirable. They stated it would only be in the starting zones for a limited time.
---
Nobody will notice? A good player will easily be able to gauge the skill level of an opponent, clicking being an obvious catch. Reactions and abilities are delayed and movement isn't fluid-like. 
---
As a clicker you won't be anywhere close to reaching your max potential and I genuinely believe it's a hindrance to your play overall.
---
With that said I'd highly suggest anyone struggling to get rid of this habit to keep on practicing. Your gameplay will evolve and I'm willing to bet you'll regret not doing it sooner. 
---
Any guild worth their salt will ask for a screenshot of your UI - some people mistakenly believe this is to see your overall UI and how beautiful or not it is - in actuality one of the main reasons for this is to see if the player has sufficiently keybound spells. This is generally an easy way to tell if said player is of the caliber you're looking for. 
---
Dwarves have good enough racials to make up for it. And, anyway, Ashjre'thul's quite a rare drop. Larvae is a good filler. 
---
But yeah, all in all, don't expect to be running much as a gunner at max level. 
---
Is Holy Pally viable in PvP?
---
I used to play using only the keyboard when I would play on pserver from work a few years back using Splashtop to my computer at home (to get around the firewall at the office).   The camera controls with the mouse were too finnicky and fast due to the remote control of Splashtop &amp; the WoW client, so I was forced to use only keyboard.
---
It wasn't too bad at all for grinding and questing!  Use tab to cycle next target, and use Home and End keys to center and cycle the camera presets.  I played a feral druid this way and had no issues.  Looting was a pain though and I remember I just always left my mouse cursor right on top of my char so I could walk right up to a dead mob and loot with just a right-click.
---
Not going to happen.
---
I did this once on Patchwerk in WotLK.
---
My DPS was horrible.
---
Basically any healer or a warrior tank. For 5 mans druid healer would probably be the lowest choice but that's just due to any lack of out of combat rez. Good healers/tanks will have a full friends list quickly.
---
I have an action bar space for quest items.
---
We will 100% get dual spec.
---
It costs 50g.
---
Nope
---
Holy pally is arguably the best PvP healer, because not only do they have plate and the strongest defensive CD's in the game, but REALLY efficient healing mana wise.  They lack in AoE healing, but it is awfully difficult to kill anything that they are healing.
---
That’s pretty cool and I’m somewhat surprised. Thanks for the reply!
---
Before keybinds should be "macro your whole rotation to one button".
---
Sad times :( It's all about the shoulders and the robe
---
They did, it was all removed/reworked in the patch prior to release (1.1).

[Old Paladin Spell Listing](https://web.archive.org/web/20040617101444/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/spelllist.html?class=Paladin)
---
Rogue or lock? I am torn between the Two - which is more fun in you guys opinion? Which performs better damage-wise? Is it easier to get a spot in groups/raids as lock? 
---
How does one get larvae?
---
I’ll probably go with a higher pop server this time around.  My antisocial nature got the better of me back in the day.  Now I want lots of people around, because that’s just that much more gold to be made and people to play with.  
---
Goddamn, /bow for getting Mute on the podcast. I fkn loved World of Roguecraft. 
---
Funny that you mention some rogues claiming that they can tank. I was playing a holy priest and our actual tank quit the group for some reason and two rogues in the group claimed that they could tank. Shall we say that the result was less than spectacular? They would start in on a mob. I'd wait as long as possible before healing them, and use the gentlest heal I could and upon casting, the mobs would instantly peel off the rogues and attack me. After this fiasco repeated itself a few times to prove to me it wasn't a fluke, I quit the group as well.
---
Vanilla has always screamed Elemental Shaman stealing powerful artifacts from Ragnaros to me.
---
You didn't know what the next patch would do.
---
Dunno if it still works, but taking a boat used to detach you from your spirit healer.
---
- Die in Auberdine.
---
- Boat to Menethil
---
- Wisp run to IF
---
- Res at IF spirit healer.
---
1. Quest level was available by addon.  Quest relative difficulty (gray, green, yellow, orange, red) was a base feature of the game.
---
Eh. Run it enough and you'll figure it out. Normally someone in a dungeon will know the general route. You may pull extra mobs as you won't know the perfect pull sequence but again, you'll figure it out. I would say that is the least of your issues as a tank. Worst case, make friends with a knowledgeable hunter.

Well, it was a rare world mob, so that fancy robe he got is probably a green Robe of The Whale or something. All that effort for a lousy green...
---
Selling tanking services to Stratholme by reserving loot is the easiest way. Most people want just a quest or a specific loot, so reserving non-equipped boss drops, first orb, the greens, the supply crates or whatever is just fine. Especially the supply crates; There is a quest for Holy Water contained in them, but you can just ask for the rest. They contain some Holy Water that is amazing tanking the undead and also the crates contain high level gray items. Most people wont bat an eye if you ask to have all [the supply crates](http://classicdb.ch/?object=176224) to help tanking and to cover repairs.
---
If you have a larger group then farming [Frostmaul E'kos](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12436) is also nice. The drop is personal, so doing it in party or raid doesn't hinder your chances of getting one. Just don't convert them into Jujus if you want to sell them.
---
I was almost pissed. 
---
Damn right, spend the gold if you want to respec.
---
Virtual keyboard.
---
WHAT? 
---
I could understand being a clicker when starting the game for the first time, or if you're really young and didn't have the mind-to-hand coordination to execute hotkeys, so I have some questions for you
---
1. How old are you?
---
2. Do you play other games than World of Warcraft? Could you list a few?
---
3. Why won't you use the keyboard to press the keys instead of the mouse?
---
4. Are you handicapped?
---
My moneys on them running a couple of 'demo weekends' where they unlock early zones like BlizzCon leading up to the release.
---
Winterspring for crystals. Burning Steppes as backup, and this also has dark iron which is also profitable. 
---
Given your nick I assume you're speaking French, so you might want to check the Blizz French forums I saw something the other day. I think they were named ZAMIS.
---
Stack up on nature and frost resist gear/mats, form a guild and be the proest of pros by telling the exact tactic for each raid the very first day it's released, do all the fun stuff others did, like kiting Kazzak into SW, things like that.
---
You’ll figure it out.  Most of the maps aren’t THAT confusing.  Pre-60 no one should mind if you go a little out of the way since speed running the pre-60 dungeons is kind of silly.  At 60 you’ll figure out the paths to the bosses you are going to kill.  Just be honest about not quite being sure on directions and your group should help out.  
---
Well that or they can find a new tank.
---
"Preach is unbanned."
---
Only mileage I got out of it was Hellfire AoE tanking the adds during phase 1 of Nefarian. 
---
You have to swipe left/right
---
There is a simpler solution where you have two shortcuts on your desktop of World of Warcraft - one for the German version and one for the English one
---
?
---
But what if he human-bots? Like... sits there and runs up and down the coast of Dalaran for hours and hours like many of us enjoy doing?
---
That said, it wasn't so high that you were perpetually at 100 Rage in raids all of the time from only one enemy.
---
That is not true. Noone said this. 
---
Having enough rage to heroic strike on CD does not mean 100 rage constantly.
---
You will get crit, but that crit does not proc enrage. 
---
I know. What does that have to do with getting crit to reduce your hp in order to make troll berserking give more haste?
---
Why would it even matter?
---
Other things to note:
---
* You can only name your pet once. Choose and choose wisely
---
* Stack loads of pet food until he acquires higher loyalty levels (which can take hours). His mood will literally drop from green to red in minutes at loyalty level 1
---
* If you want an owl as pet, go grab one at level 10 in Teldrassil. The next opportunity will be close to 50. For Horde this will be an exciting adventure by itself
---
* Don't bother with gear too much except for your raw bow dps. Hunters do not scale well stat-wise, so a few points of agi isn't that important in your dps.
---
* Don't forget to right-click on pet bar abilities lie bite &amp; growl (especially growl!!!), so a flickering rectangle appears over the icon. This will set them to automatic. Your pet will not execute a growl by himself otherwise. 
---
Nature of the beast.  You would see those get used a lot more if they did a level capped release like the original alpha/beta.  As it stands, most people are going to be flying to 60, and all those recipes are just there to skill up and vendor on the way to the 60 cap recipes, which at least there’s some good stuff there as opposed to retail.  
---
They’re fun if you’re taking things slow, but I don’t imagine that’s going to be the common story.  
---
Well my naga is from like 06 and still working great. I can’t speak for the newer models. But any mmo gaming mouse will change your wow game for the better.
---
AQ40, Ouro drop.

Rip TB

You're immortal now OP: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190327153752/https://i.redd.it/tqm52u8tbmo21.jpg](https://web.archive.org/web/20190327153752/https://i.redd.it/tqm52u8tbmo21.jpg)
---
Because it's a necessary gold sink. Because it's an RPG and your choice should matter. Because you play a specialized role and you should not be able to quickly change to another without some consequences.
---
I no lifed my horde priest this weekend and was getting so frustrated with this.  Quick runs can be okay if youre just there for XP, but the big problem comes in when people dont pay attention to *anything* thats going on, and dont use common sense.
---
Quite a few tanks not watching my mana at ALL.  Some of them im fairly sure werent using defensive abilities/any CDs.
---
So few interrupts.  The shadow casters in AN or OK (in Wrath) were beyond painful.  I had one tank grab two groups, each group had one of those in it.  No one interrupted the shadow casts.  Later that run or in another run i was trying to CC them when no one was interrupting, but between people breaking the CC, having a lot of healing to do, etc it was pretty difficult.
---
In general just the 'rush rush, pull more' mentality and then tanks taking massive damage.  If it wasnt the tank pulling extra, it was the DPS.  Bleh.
---
Feral druid or ret pally?
---
I play vanilla currently and main priest; I love it, but I feel the challenge of melee/dps calling me. Only issue is that I find myself *most* intrigued by the so-called "meme" specs: ret pally and feral druid.
---
I've done enough research on ret pallies to know they'll probably continue to be meme-y unless Judgements stack and you get 5-6 rets together spamming the different ranks. Conversely, I've done enough research on feral druids (thanks Taladril and Shedo!) to know that bear tanking is actually quite viable through a lot of content as mostly-maintank and very viable as offtank. Shedo has also had some insane dps parses as feral kitty through BWL so I know it's possible to not be *terrible*.
---
Either case gives me the option to fall back on healing should I prove substandard in the meme dps/tank department.
---
What would you suggest?
---
If only the game could be played in CLI; graphics are overrated.
---
It think that is a horrible idea. 
---
Do you mean that there won't be 100% move speed mounts at level 60 right off the bat? I thought they always existed from launch, but that the 100% "armored" models were added later. So we are starting with unarmored, level 60 100% move speed included in the game. 
---
It does make sense to have garbage items along with good ones, though. Makes the good ones more noticeable.
---
If we had every single item optimized with a good stat distribution, it would come to a point where the only factor is more stats = better, and itemlevel could potentially come up.
---
But yeah, some specs being garbage in every single situation (moonkin, enhance) is not cool.
---
TheRealRecollector doesn't know shit.
---
Just because the meta was one thing in 2006, doesn't mean it isn't subject to change. He made many absurd statements on this thread. Truth is, we don't know exactly what the tank meta will look like come classic. However, if you do need more threat, fury prot will give you that. Whether /sit works or not. 
---
The things he is saying are so ridiculous. In one thread he says you lose "SO MUCH" survivability from going from prot to fury. Then in another thread he gets called out and he is forced to admit that the difference between prot and fury survivability is very minor. If you look at the talent trees, this is very clear. 
---
He thinks that fury prot is always less threat than impale prot without /sit. This is straight up wrong. Fury Prot only produces less threat than impale when you are very rage starved. There are ways to work around this by rage pooling each pull and by using rage potions. 
---
I have no interest in arguing with that person further. They have clearly not played the spec themselves, and are arguing from a position based on 14 year old memories, not facts. 
---
Those low poly ogres are awful lol.
---
So what even is the streamer problem in retail?  Someone internet famous rolls around with their groupies until some other groupies jump them and brawl it out?  Doesn’t seem any more of a problem than a random guild doing the same thing barring a bunch of “notice me senpai!” messages.  
---
Always check petopia to see if the quest zone you're about to engage has mobs that can teach new ranks. That way you won't have much downtime. 
---
For cats for example, Desolace has mobs close together teaching the next rank of both bite &amp; claw.
---
This might seem a bit sadistic, but I'm excited for paladins again (and I'll prob roll a human pally). I miss the old Seal / Judgment system and I miss the old buffs. Sure, it'd be great if the Seals lasted minutes instead of seconds and that using Judgment didn't remove the seal, but eh. There was something about that system that I liked.
---
Start by just forcing yourself to at least use 1-4 as keybinds to start teaching your brian that your left hand is casting the abilities now, and grow in keybindings from there, starting with the most used and most important abilities.
---
Also keep the same general bindings across each class. This is super easy in retail as classes are all so similar these days, but in classic you will be able to do this too. For example in retail every character has Q bound to trinket, E bound to interrupt, R bound to my main stun/CC, Z to movement speed boost/snare escape, X to any form of immediate movement (blink, the horse charge on paladin etc).
---
Eventually you'll end up running out of keybindings especially in classic so that's where you'll start pressing shift+1, or Alt+R etc etc. Don't try to rebind everything in one go it'll confuse you massively, just get your main abilities bound, get used to activating abilities with your left hand, and slowly add to it. 
---
Spriests are typically at the bottom of the dps charts til Naxx, where the move up just a few slots. Be prepared to be passed over. A new meta popping up is to take a "holy" or tri-spec priest with 20 points in shadow for the debuff, who keeps the debuff up on mobs/bosses for the locks and heals in between.
---
It's not impossible and it's definitely viable, but it will be harder to get a slot if you're not established in a guild from the get-go.
---
Flurry procs weapons more (thunderfury/Ironfoe/other good tank weapons), it also lets you put out more heroic strikes.   
---
Saying that the majority of fury scaling comes from Enrage proc is a huge joke. DPS Fury warriors are one of the best scaling specs in the game. They don't even get enrage procs since the boss isn't hitting them.   
---
The majority is most certainly not just baked into the Enrage talent. Don't bullshit.
---
My favorite classes evolved into ranged/caster styles and love pvp, so I will not be recreating my vanilla pve rogue. I plan to recreate my original character as an alt that I can play from time to time. I don’t think you need to recreate your same character from wow to enjoy it as much. I actually think you will enjoy it more of you go with your current interests. 
---
That’s a good point, I know a lot of streamers were afraid to roll on pvp servers(and justifiably so). I’m absolutely going to play on a pvp server so I guess that can server as a bit of streamer protection. I think in addition to that I might try to steal a few famous streamers character names or something, in hopes it would discourage them from rolling on my server XD
---
Hi! I would like to know more about Kor Kron Vanguard, so I have a few questions:
---
\- do you much incline towards WPvP, instead of Premade BGs and ranking? Should players interested in premade BG's and ranking be a good fit?
---
\- do you plan to add some PvP requirements, like all PvP Raiders to skill engineering or to spec properly for PvP raids?
---
\- do you plan to do some AQ40/Naxx progression?
---
\- Is Kor Kron Vanguard affiliate with the website Barrens Chat or just happened to post the guide there? The website looks amazing!
---
Thank you!
---
Sharding is going to be a necessary evil for the beginning zone. Blizzard has started this.
---
Streamers will be vocal about their server choice, so just keep an eye on them.
---
Up to the end of BWL, they will be very good in PVE, so if you don't intend to really hardcore raid the shit out of Classic, hunters will do fine in raids. By that time, you can always drop hunter (keep it as farm-alt) and level another class that scales better with Naxx etc.
---
How so?
---
*Weave arcane and multi-shot between autos...*
---
I beg your pardon?
---
Yes. I am not debating that. I am saying that even without /sit, fury prot still can make more threat than impale.
---
soon™
---
Cool, I couldn’t remember, thank you 
---
&gt; every single
---
I dont care for every single item to be perfect
---
its just that there are way too many shit items and some could be tweaked a bit
---
or just change 2 talents like the guy in the podcast said moonkins need %hit talents and druids need +defense
---
Upgraded dungeon set is a good jump off for PVP, but you will most likely want the pvp rank gear you can buy from PVP vendors when you get to certain ranks. 
---
world of roguecraft 2&amp;3 are my absolute favorite vanilla videos, highly recommend anyone that hasnt to go watch them
---
When you first get your pet, do yourself a favor and pick up 40 Haunch of Meat from a meat vendor in your local major city, for maybe 10 silver. You will very quickly go through it during level 10-13 as your pet has low loyalty and will need like 4-6 at the very beginning just to get them happy after taming. The first loyalty levels of a pet totally chew up your food stores. Also, make sure you have the correct food type for whatever pet type you want to tame!
---
Really having a difficult time choosing between Warrior and Mage. I feel like Mage is going to be a more comfortable choice and will allow me to get my feet underneath me to be able to level a Warrior later (ie. funneling gold and gear). The only thing I'm worried about with picking a Mage is the boring frostbolt spam at endgame. I also feel like there will be too many Warriors to find dungeon/raid spots and I wont have the gold to be able to complete repairs, buy food, and all that stuff.  
---
I guess my questions are (1) how is the Warrior rotation for DPS and/or tanking in dungeons and (2) even though a quarter of the population will be Warriors, do you think finding groups will still be possible, even if I choose to tank?
---
I'm a complete noob, what does AQ40 mean ?
---
Now I’m imagining a small group thinking you are the streamer and following you around haha. 
---
Those low level Darkshore cats don't have claw, only cower (which is useless). First grab an owl in Teldrassil for claw.
---
World Buff CDs are completely irrelevant. It's not like tanks leave mid raid to refresh world buffs on private servers.  Good guilds will still have world buffs for raids in Classic. Period.   
---
Correct armor values is a pretty big unknown. However, there is evidence to indicate that private servers actually give the bosses too much armor. There are various ways this could play out, but I really don't think its going to affect threat too much. If the boss has more armor in Classic, everyone generates less threat.   
---
Finally, if you played Vanilla, you know threat issues were a thing. It is completely understandable that pushing threat further is a thing for tanks in Vanilla.

I think arenas and the changes to class balance were actually mostly fine. Every spec was viable but they were all still unique and brought distinct utility to raids. I don't PvP so I'm kinda whatever about arenas, but I can't imagine it's that big a problem. Also, let's not act like vanilla dungeons weren't mostly linear or close to it. 
---
Quite soon after vanilla, I don’t remember when but my best guess is during Wrath.
---
I find it annoying that if I have rank 6 bite, I need 20 skill points for rank 7, but I also paid for the rank 6 bite (let's say 15p), meaning I pay 35 points total for rank 7.
---
But If I untrain all my pet skills, I can spend 20 points immediately for rank 7. I continually have to untrain/retrain all that stuff.  I wish they should have made it that it only cost rank 7-rank6 skillpoints to upgrade (i.e. the difference).
---
Temple of Ahn'Qiraj, the second hardest raid, a 40-man instance.
---
Oh I see, thanks.
---
Duel spec shouldn't happen. It changes the fabric of the game, especially in vanilla. You make a choice on your spec because it is expensive to change it, and that makes it mean something.
---
The prot warrior in your guild isn't necessarily the spec because he wants to be, but because he wants to help others clear dungeons. Same for healing specs. Spec choices are more than just your personal bubble of picks, but impact the other people you play with. If you could change that at a whim it would make choices far less meaningful. 
---
Yes, you can change your spec on a whim, or mid raid, or at any point, but most don't unless something specifically calls for it. And that tends to also help bring distinct identity to your toon. 
---
myeah higher pop
---
if I want a dead server I'll just play singleplayer rpgs
---
Ah shit. You are totally right. Missed the context here. Yea should work just fine for trolls on classic !
---
two problems with your thinking:
---
1: a lot of the time youre better off running the agi totem over wf totem because you need your tanks to get hit less. its 3.35% dodge and crit on a warrior (3.85% when you get rank 3 from aq). initially, its tempting to think "lmao bro 20% &gt; 3.something%!!!!!", but once you remember that it only gives extra autoattacks (which dont do much damage at all) that dont even supply useful rage (youre rage capped when tanking bosses at almost all times) to convert into more abilities, you have to wonder if all that crit with shield slam, bloodthirst if youre running that build, revenge, and heroic strike ends up being more threat. remember, crits do mean more threat
---
2: if youre kept in the tank group instead of dps group (which i think is reasonable, since youd be receiving blood pact and air totem), your friendly prot warriors get the extra crit for threat gen as well to help stave off the fury warriors rocketing up the threat meter. even if this isnt too helpful on a lot of the bosses, if you have the ability to bounce yourself around raid groups, it does greatly facilitate trash clears and add-based encounters
---
6.35-6.85% crit + 3.35-3.85% dodge &gt; 20% chance to get an autoattack that hits for like 100 damage
---
used to be a resto shaman on a kt horde guild. my tanks never complained about me preferring to use agi totem for them over windfury. but druids still outthreat warriors even with windfury; saw it firsthand time and time again. the gap might be considerably close if the prot warrior was playing troll so he could reliably control berserking to ramp up his heroic strike production, but lets be real - nobody plays troll warrior
---
Dungeon Set 2 is a chain of quests that require Dungeon Set 1, which are dungeon drops.  Those quests involve doing some difficult dungeon runs and a bunch of crafting materials.  
---
I haven't done that much wishful thinking since the day before the Muller report was released.
---
Yeah and doing a few dungeons is probably the slowest way of leveling possible unless you do the quests, which is only viable the first run. I suppose it’s not a problem that you have to grind but it is a fact you’ll have to. 
---
A rogue with maximal stealth is:  
---
MOD 3 (+15)  
---
Night Elf (+5)  
---
Boots of Displacement (+8)  
---
I forget what + vanish was during its duration in vanilla, but it is very large.  
---
You can also get stealth detect pretty high as a human rogue- you don't have native access to paranoia (unless a lock is in your party), or track hidden, but you also have a big advantage of your position being mostly unknown, and being able to sweep areas with sprint.  In that world, you of course have the statless goggles on (with a macro to switch them out before you open), and catseye and all that other stuff.  
---
Back in the day, I was more worried about a rogue with these things than a hunter or a warlock, because I could see those guys a mile away.
---
I will go for the one only poor little RP PvP severs they throw up with 15 y old hardware :(
---
Don't be a traitor ! Stay in Silverpine !
---
I'm definitely considering a hunter initially and then maybe a shaman alt. :)
---
I always had them on when searching for enemy rogues on my rogue, and I would macro them away before opening (sometimes I'd sap first, then switch them out).
---
Cave quests are almost an intro to real dungeons imo
---
keybinds if on the easy-to-access binds, otherwise /cast in combat, or click in spellbook if we have time.
---
Lmfao imagine? Nah I wouldn’t play that character, just let them sit around
---
Classic wow release data reveal ... hah jk 
---
So does that mean we will be doing lvl 20 twinks then?
---
The class changes were the best thing about BC, agreed. But I'd rather have them in Classic as that's where they were going to be placed anyhow before they decided to commit them to BC. Most vanilla dungeons were linear indeed, but they weren't single corridor hallways like the majority of BC dungeons. 
---
Tanking is fun with a good group, dps is always fun, geting thous big numbers up.
---
Ofc finding groups will be possible, 90% of all warriors on the server will go "i am dps, i am not a tank", goodluck to them. Play as tank - find groups anywhere under 5mins, get tanking loot since ur the tank, get dps loot since u dont invite other warriors to group, easy.
---
Overall playing mage is like playing game on easy mode and yes it can be boring at raiding. But ofc u can have a mage then pimp your warrior alt with blues and all that. 
---

Type 'help' for a list of available commands
---
I cant decide if I want to listen to this before or during classic. Maybe I'll try and line up the patches.
---
As you mention, sub-300 skill craftables are typically vendored because they're absolute trash.   
---
I can't see any point in *not* buffing these items so that they're actually useful for leveling players.
---
Taurens are the most pacifist race in the game. That being said, I don't think it fits for then to have a weapon specialization. They don't find pleasure on fighting, only do it if it's truly needed.
---
Do what you want, but my question is always “do I need just another warm body, or do I need someone doing their job well?”  Do you bring utility to the group, or are you trying to be a snowflake and dragging the rest of us down in the process?  
---
Honestly, I agree for the most part. The problem is it is hard to suggest these specs to people. If you really know what you are getting into, by all means, go for it. There are some people that don't really know the challenging road they have ahead and it is just easier to suggest a more straight forward spec. Farming consumes for MC just to make your spec pull reasonable numbers is a big commitment and may get exhausting for the average player.
---
Current meta is to bring 25% warriors (most fury) to a 40man. You will always be able to get a group. Tricky part will be competing with the other fury warriors / rogues / ferals / sometimes tanks for gear. The fury warrior rotation is definitely more interesting than mage though. 
---
Your fears of being redundant are unfounded, but expect good competition on gear. An east way to solve this with getting your pre-bis (doesnt work in raids really) is to main tank and res your gear from the start. Tanks pretty much run the LFG system, so you will get to call the shots.
---
Druid for travel form.

[This is what a real Paladin looks like.](https://v637g.app.goo.gl/ymgTQ9672HQC51NKA) Cast your damn spells through your spellbook if you want to be a real Paladin.
---
There is rather two problems with ur thinking:
---
1. Anyone not being a mega pleb is DW tanking, making WF even better.
---
2. Any shaman not being a pleb is weaving WF and air. 
---
It all depents who and how you ask if your spec is viable.
---
If you ask an hardcore raider the awnser is diffrent than when you ask a PvPer or a goldfarmer, RP-er, Alt-oholic leveling fan or casual.
---
Every race, class or spec has there own strong points. 
---
Like on principal though. This isn't even a significant change, and if you're gonna have this time capsule server option why even have any changes let alone insignificant ones.
---
It sure is inspired by the north american natives, however there are hunter gatherers like the kenyan Massai who use a club called Rungu which has an important role in their culture.
---
It is both used for hunting and warfare:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungu\_(weapon)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungu_(weapon)) 
---
Would you not be proficient and a tool you would use every day to build and maintain your living? They use a lot of wood joining and stakes that would need a good mallet to put in place.
---
Alright, i'll give you that. In a 1v1 PvP situation the difference can be spotted. However, running dungeons, raids or PUG battle grounds, nobody will notice the difference. Especially if you're a skilled clicker as OP describes in the post.
---
If it’s possible I would definitely need to change the wording so I feel like Harry Potter casting spells. 
---
“Alexia firebolto!”
---
What do you mean "kicked because got outDPSed by a tank?"
---
Ssssh, I will have higher priority for 2handers which I may or may not use in PvP (I may). :D
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwlUpNStak0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwlUpNStak0) 
---
No no. In vanilla I’m pretty sure it was 10-19
---
What I'm aiming for classic is to play the game without look at any guide or info on databases on things like that since, at least for me, one thing that keep me away from WoW is that we know everything even before it goes live, and theres is too much information for every single thing.
---
I feel like a bot... just emulating instructions that should be followed. MAYBE the only thing I'll look at are some talent tree tips (not necessarily how to build a spec)
---
Huh? Aimed shot, auto shot, auto shot, multi shot, auto shot, repeat. Two buttons. Super boring rotation. Most fun part of being a great hunter was designated aggro puller. That and being able to let fly all cooldowns and have a consistent threat relief in FD. But there was nothing demanding about PvE as a hunter either. 
---
Yeah the very first razer products back when they were one of the first companies to make actual gaming stuff is fine. But now every product they make is hot garbage. and the g600 is a fantastic mouse if youre ever looking for a good update. 
---
One of the core elements of vanilla was weird, strange and broken itemization. There are tier sets that aren't really good for some specs, there is green / blue items that are better than epics (for some cases) etc. Start making itemization "immersive" in some part of the game would mean we should make same immersion update on other parts of the game also. How much immersion do you think we can add to the game before it's not even remotely close to Vanilla anymore? 
---
I don’t think it would be an advantage at all. Even assuming Alexa never made a mistake it takes longer to say “Alexa, cast ___” than it does to hit a key, not to mention that slight delay before Alexa actually starts doing said task. In the same time I could probably spam said key like 10 times. 
---
You (and me)  were among a minority though. A bigger chunk of the playerbase was quite ignorant, even with the information available on the internet. That information just didn't reach as many players as it does now in 2019.  
---
I played in a  casual-hardcore guild myself with friends, but I also had co-workers that played really casually. Even after 2 years playing they were really ignorant on a large number of things in the game, both in content and in game mechanics.  They still had a great time playing though, it's not like you NEEDED to know all this stuff  to enjoy yourself. 
---
This is the kind of stuff that I wish people would do guides on, sick to death of the extremely general information presented as a guide. We need more in depth stuff like this, I really appreciate you posting this, even if I end up choosing rogue at least I know what I was getting into.
---
I wouldnt care as a purist as long as you do that stuff on another server. Give me my actual vanilla, and you can do what you please on a third server type for all I care.
---
Yeah, I didn't get the other folders nearly enough, found it now. This is exactly what I've been looking for.
---
But where are the "addon" tab that is usually on the bottom-left corner?
---
Basically, when everybody would be lvl 40 - fresh 60, I would buy up all the lvl 19 twink items en masse , because it would before twinking was invented on a large scale and these items would go for absolute bottom prices. 
---
You’re saying solo wpvp, so I assume you plan to play shadow? If these two classes are your only considerations then I would highly suggest the Hunter. 
---
Shadow priest is very good but if your primary goal is solo wpvp and not raiding, duels, etc then the hunter will get you more bang for your buck. Wpvp is about applying pressure, using the environment, surprise, adaptation etc. Hunter has a far greater tool kit for applying pressure, using the environment, escaping, resetting than priest does. If someone doesn’t want to fight your priest in the open world, they can just blink or cheetah away and not deal with you. At best you have net which they can get out of using talents or whatever because they know you have no other form of cc or movement boosts. Hunter doesn’t suffer from this problem.
---
Not to mention that gearing up a shadow priest isn’t a walk in the park. Unless you’re well established and get lucky with gear or the PvP ranking gear is out early enough, you’re just going to be struggling to maintain two gear sets for healing and dps and they’ll likely be gimped. Hunter is quite strong in PvP with prebis and thenT1 gear, which provides a lot of fun for quite some time before other classes catch up with gear. 
---
There was a madlad in legion who healed I think only with chat commands on a mythic boss. His performance was not great but was cool to watch
---
Any Kor'gall players around?
---
&gt; I have no idea why anyone would play a Warlock on Alliance when  \[...\]
---
I was merely answering to that.
---
strat UD can also be highly profitable if you have disenchanting as the green lvl 57 BoPs can give GEEs which sell for 4-10g depending on the economy and you can get upto 3 per green. You kill 4 of these mobs so chances are really good.
---
Are there any other cats that do? I am hoping to play with a dark colored cat to be exact 
---
"I got ganked in STV and now I'm covered in boo-boo's!"

---
I would have smacked myself across the face when I clicked on Paladin.
---
As long as you have fun and don't try to force me to have fun with you I don't care. Do whatever makes you happy.
---
Seriously, farming as a warrior was my favorite thing of any classes. Warriors with a little bit of decent gear shreds mobs super fast, and with intercept and charge you could zip-zap between them so fast.
---
One thing I did as a warrior to farm gold was to farm Felcloth from Satyr's in Felwood.
---
No changes.
---
Logitech G600 is a huge mouse though. Too big. They should've just left the ringfinger-button out and reduced the overall footprint. The buttons on the G600 are a little bit nicer though compared to the Naga Chroma. I've used the Original Naga, G600, Corsair Scimitar and Naga Chroma (non-Epic). In that order. And sadly the Naga Chroma hit the right spot between being a thumbgrid mouse and not being too bulky. 
---
Ret paladin was really fun when I played in Vanilla, i always remember hitting like a truck and had good burst even with a Bone Reavers Edge
---
I mainly used it for AOE farming.
---
I think open beta is more than likely because they need to do a stress test with how wonky the servers are in BFA with 3-4 raids in the same area. 
---
Yeah ok fair point.
---
My lord, those upgraded sets take a longgg time and a lot of resources. The quest chains are massive, I think the first upgrade to your bracers costs like 20g too. Probably be better off just getting honor gear. Also I believe the upgraded dungeon sets won’t be implemented until a ways after launch
---
Hunter, Shaman or Warlock.
---
I started vanilla on release as a shaman, loved enhancement in early stages and under geared PvP, loved elemental PvP, hated being the raid healer because it was stressful AF to keep up idiots who are dying because they cant keep control of their threat and going OOM all the time. But the totem juggling, purge and shocks made it seem like a huge skill ceiling I enjoyed excelling at. Nothing more fun than being able to 1v1 almost any average class because you can out skill them with knowledge and the right timing/totems. 
---
So I rolled a hunter, loved raiding and general PvE. Wasnt a fan of PvP with a hunter because anyone worth a salt just CC's you to death or targets you early to put you out of the match. Against trash players and in AV PvP was a blast. And I had an affinity for rare pets and mounts (I love all animals) so it was an easy fit.
---
Warlock seems like a challenge similar to shaman, of played at the skill cap there doesnt seem like much that can stand in your way. I'm afraid of battling the wave of mages and priests for gear and being undefeated for so long it stops being fun. That and debuff limits on mobs make raids a one button shadow bolt and then stand around doing nothing if threat is too high type fight. Sounds super boring for raid PvE. 
---
As you can tell I'm leaning shaman hunter but do I really want to play the two classes I already played throughout vanilla versus something new like warlock? Help convince me or suggest something else I'm missing. 
---
It worked just fine for me when I bound it to bloodthirsty like that
---
Just in time for classes! :)
---
You can be a tankstitute and sell your services.
---
&gt;Hate
---
Before applying, I would have some question, if possible:
---
\- Does &lt;Hate&gt; plans to do Premade BG's and be competitive in PvP as a group, or it's more of an individual thing to do in off days?
---
\- It will stay as a semi-hardcore guild, or just start as one?
---
\- Could you be a bit more specific on "late afternoons"?
---
\- Do you plan to tackle World Bosses?
---
\- Do expensive consumables like Flask of Supreme Power are expected and required in the first content phases? (Until AQ40/Naxx)
---
Why would a troll admit to trolling? No. The guy just said things had been "confirmed through various sources" which he never provided and other posters realised he was the same guy who'd been posting BS "leaks" for a while. He's either trolling or just believes everything he reads on message boards. You can't prove it's fake until it hasn't happened, that's not where the burden of proof lies. 
---
Lol
---
I'd be cool with a 1.13 patch after Naxx has been out for awhile, with adjusted talent trees for things like prot and enhance and maybe a 20 man Kara raid with sidegrade or offspec gear
---
&gt; I am going to pretend that the server infrastructure is going to work exactly how we want it, with no phasing after launch (doubt it) and also, what are they going to do about the streamers?
---
Trust me, you will want phasing at the beginning of the game. Later you probably didn't need it, but it's a life saver at the start, and is a requirement, or else you will be spending several days leveling from 1 to 10
---
Mind wandered. I meant aimed obviously. Though interestingly, it did become arcane in the rotation in tbc pre patch.
---
God I hated tbc hunter. Having only BM or trash tier DPS survival hunter was worst.
---
Stop trying to hide it...everyone can tell you're a bot.
---
[lightning bolt, lightning bolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ04mfAY2BU)
---
Not really. 
---
My two pieces of advice are: don’t do talent optimisation or anything like that until max level. Don’t pick a race class combo based on minmaxing. I think these are the two things lots of people will do without realising how much fun they are sacrificing.
---
When I level Undead, I always go to The Barrens once I hit level 6 or 10
---
They would release Diablo Immortal
---
So you want to be stuck at level 1 to 10 for several days?
---
I couldn't agree more.  I have been thinking about this for years and one of my dreams is to one day start a vanilla server with gameplay the same, just stock nostalrius or whatever the best open source core is, but with a revamped crafting system.  
---
I can give you some explanation why many items are so crappy though:  much of the designs of craftables are from alpha and beta patches, when all gear was worse in general.  Over time, up to launch and in the later patches they kept adding more and better quest rewards, more drops from npcs and some new crafts, making the oldest ones worse and worse in comparison.  You can also see remnants of this in the crap that some vendors sell. Like lvl 40 white weapons.   In a very early stage of the game, white items would be  normal, uncommon would be really uncommon and rare would be really rare. Basically all gear shifted on step to more common.  It's quite easy to get into all blues at some point, so its not really 'rare' if everybody has all blue gear, is it?     the bad craft gear is mostly from the very early time when having all greens would actually be a accomplishment. 
---
Then you level a druid before then, and main it in TBC.  I played a druid in Vanilla, and while I did have some fun, I mostly healed, and the class isn't even great at that.  Though I was one of the lucky ones that did get to tank and dps in raids, and got some gear for it as well.
---
Maybe the community will be different, and if they don't significantly buff MC/BWL it won't matter who you bring anyway, but as much as I love my druid (mained for 15 years) I'm playing a rogue or war this time around.
---
Kinda reads to me as, "You can't raid unless you can do your job well, which comes with experience and know how to fully utilize your toolkit to bring utility."
---
So yeah, I've got to completely disagree.  No new raider is going to have experience or know how to utilize their class and absolutely shouldn't be shunned from raiding.  The raids were designed for casuals to be able to complete them.
---
Calling Joe who spent all year getting to 60 in his nearly non-existent time just to earn a slot in your raid shouldn't be insulted as being a warm bodied snowflake.  You didn't make a point, you just belittled the opposition.
---
You won't be, I played on many servers with no dynamic respawns on server launches. 
---
I hope they're spicy like Tabasco cereal
---
"If a match-up begins and drops everyone due to lack a lack of players, Horde automatically wins."
---
lol this one has no rhyme or reason.
---
I’ll play whatever it defaults/recommends
---
No. You're changing items, that's changing the game, it's no longer classic. The entire point is to stay as faithful as possible within reason.
---
I really don't understand why we're still seeing posts like this, they're all horrible ideas that the community doesn't want and that will never happen. Give it up. 
---
How about in PvP - being able to identify how strong an opponent is based on their armor.  No more transmog.  You see a warrior with full T2 running at you you turn and run.  Or seeing the paladins in tier gear and being jealous.  
---
Just tame the owl, kill a few mobs with it until you get the 'you learned claw rank x', then tame the cat you'd like.
---
No sir, I am looking for an RP server with the stupidest but most easily remembered name.
---
Nobody understands that hunters need a melee weapon and a bow.  And if you exclude all the good 2H swords because “Arms offspec is more important than Hunter mainspec” then what’s really left for hunters besides like 1 polearm or daggers or something. And even then they will be rolling against rogues.  
---
Woah, it better not be. I'm away that weekend.
---
I did too. But the circumstances where different back then, a lot more players will log in at the same time this time around. It'll be a clusterfuck
---
And epic Windows Movie Maker editing.
---
"Low Pop" with healthy 2-4k for me. I don't have the urge to battle for every peacebloom. 
---
What are you talking about? Those servers were 5-15k, if the vanilla servers are authentic they won't allow more than 3-5k on them. 
---
They’re not trash, they just aren’t particularly critical to leveling because most of the time no gear is, excluding weapons on melee.  They’re fine for the ilvl, it’s simply a matter of “would I rather craft that deviate scale belt or get back to questing/grinding?”  Even the AH these days people know to keep away from until mid-50’s.  
---
I'm gonna start putting a penny in a jar for every dumb question I see asked on this sub. By the time classic launches I should have a few months worth of subscription.
---
I personally farmed ungoro for dreamfoil and other lesser herbs in the area with mining for some arcane crystals. When the market rises up it got to about 15g a stack and you could get about 4 stacks in an hour plus anything else you happen to get that's worth a shit. So it's about 50-60g+ an hour which was insane. But it's really tedious.
---
I did that in TBC and Wrath. I really enjoyed it and it certainly felt unique. Although I often thought about how Tauren get 10% more HP but trolls have regeneration which is also nice.
---
Have fun, troll. I will likely roll a bear cat this time as my main. :D
---
I don;t think he means any of that, he just wants a bit more use-fullness out of some of the early craftable items.  what harm could be done if let's say  the Crimson Silk tailoring set would be just that little bit better, so that somebody would actually think: " yes! I am going to make that and wear it from lvl 30-40"  (hint:  nobody ever crafts that now) 
---
We had bwl on farm for months, they just would never drop. They finally dropped and some asshole with more dkp outbid me even tho he only had like 4/8. I was not happy.
---
32.33% (recurring, of course).
---
where wont be dm for a while
---
The way that +profession skill works is very strong and makes leveling engineering way faster and cheaper.
---
Thanks very much for translating! It's interesting to see what people were saying at the time 
---
beep boop
---
*laughs in tbc bm hunter*
---
&gt;  Buy up all of the silver ore on the AH and relist it. Buy up the stacks of thorium and split them down into smaller more expensive groups. If someone can buy up the 5 thorium they need for say 6g, they may buy that over buying 20 for 15g. 
---
then you risk having a random guy unleash his stacks downcutting you

Ofc he don't mean that but that's what eventually will happen when everybody starts having their small "what harm could be done" immersion updates. I want Vanilla, not Immersion updated vanilla. This is my opinion, you are free to have yours.
---
open world farming works best ie if you got skinning and herb or mining
---
so u could farm EPL bats for the trash loot, skin them and also herb/mine whatever nearby
---
The information was disseminated as soon as the patch came out on the PTR server, weeks before it hit live servers, just like how it happens today.
---
thanks for making or finding this list.  I will save a copy on my own pc

Name a few please.

The majority of people were likely in favor of lfg, flying, welfare gear, and a whole host of other garbage that might look good on paper but actually ended up being harmful to the experience.

did u use a macro to swap trackers?

Love it when someone tries to correct someone else using wrong information
---
Classicdb lists both catseye potion and bloodvine lens as giving +10, so a full 2 lvls each.  Bloodvine lens is leather though, so a warlock can't wear them, and the cloth version does not have stealth detection.
---
It also lists perception as giving +50, so 10 levels for 20 seconds.
---
Druids PvP gloves give +10 stealth detection, so they are also quite good at countering stealth.
---
Man, I spent so much time trying to make prot paladin good. 
---
Sigh. 
---
Of course band of accuria will be in the game :)
---
I was on a high pop server and it quickly got full with a queue of 800 players. That was a long wait to login. Was fortunately able to transfer to another server with a more reasonable population. Not sure what the caps were in early Vanilla, but both servers were very lively. Lots of fighting in STV as well.
---
Keep in mind, as a priest you will learn some of your race-specific abilities around level 10. I believe as undead you will find yours at undercity. So you might be best off getting to 10-12, then meeting your buddy in the barrens

I'm going to name my gnome warrior "Cement" now. Thanks.

Only a restriction on PvP servers.

Id argue tanks have a higher skill required. You have a lot more riding on your actions. Your positioning and timing need to be on point and your ability to manage threat is detrimental.  With healing you have plenty of other healers to back you up. None of the classes are overly difficult in reality though. If you are concerned about messing up and having more to do in the raid environment id definitely stick with the shaman healing. Place your totems, cast chain heal on melee and repeat. Sure there is a little more to it than that but tanking def requires more knowledge and skill.
---
However, if you are willing to research the class and put in the time required to play a tank then by all means please do! Most importantly have fun! :)
---
The target of course is a server with a pop just under the limit such that there will be no/short queues at prime time.
---
10k pop and 400% dynamic spawn rates? Eeeeeh no thanks. I'd like to recognize at least some of the faces when I walk into Org.
---
I had absolutely no idea how to fish. I got my fishing pole, saw I had the Fishing skill, was standing by water, but couldn’t figure it out. Wasn’t until later I realized the Fishing icon wasn’t a passive skill like weapon specialization. 
---
Best anti gank healer, other healers are way easier to lock down
---
I genuinely feel a bit pathetic with how much I want to play after seeing simple SSs like this...
---
Not only blasphemy, I believe it is punishable by *death* to suggest such a thing
---
Certainly always the risk. But, if you buy them up when they've already been pushed down and reset it to the server normal it usually works out ok. Knowing the server cycles etc is also handy. Like normally the most buying on my server is done on raid reset days so I push the prices up that day. And the most undercutting tends to happen friday-sunday so I buy up at the bottom on those days and relist raid day. This does require money ahead of time though and sometimes it doesn't work, but its only gold. I had alot of gold in vanilla so it worked for me. 
---
Didn't they?
---
Link up/merge as in fusion?
---
I love me some DBZ...
---
No, you would need so much arcane resistance to even have a chance to resist, not worth it
---
Excellent addition u fucking pidgeon. 
---
I've seen so many people bind strafe to A and D.
---
Why is this? I mean, I have right click pressed all the time while in combat as I use the mouse to move, so A and D still act like strafe anyway.
---
Also adds the disadvantage of not being able to play with only your left hand, something I do all the time while eating.
---
There has to be some hidden advantage to having only strafe, but I just don't get it.
---
Also of you are interested in just playing warrior as a dps that isn't too hard either but you will have to roll for loot against a mass of other warriors, rogues, hunters meaning more time that you may not have. Good luck!
---
Taurens are bipedal and bipedal mammals don't graze.
---
They probably eat leaves off of short trees and bushes.
---
Just fake cast
---
I got in with a guild group farming DM East I believe. One resto shaman dropping windfury with four warriors. I think we had 1-2 prot, 1-2 arms, 1 fury. We were mostly farming disenchant mats and arcane crystals from the thorium veins at the end. Run it again and again and got our time down to really fucking fast. I think that was the best gold I made in classic.  
---
Solo I was farming camps in Silithus for texts/runecloth/costumes. That's the reason I made my first bank alt. 
---
That does not demonstrate the thing you are claiming to demonstrate. 
---
Why are you talking about new raiders? The OP and the comment you're replying are both talking about suboptimal/meme specs. Don't put words in their mouth.
---
Those internet Drill Sergeants get old really fast...
---
&gt;  And the most undercutting tends to happen friday-sunday 
---
myeah thats when the server pop goes up and more items flood in
---
Tauren use *totems* as weapons.
---
I'll admit I've had moments in raids where I can't find a spell on my spellbar, and searching through the spell book would be too slow since I knew the name and I just /cast'ed it.  (Looking at you /cast Create Healthstone)
---
Then say so. "It wasn't in vanilla" is a perfectly valid argument. It's silly when people pejoratively say "lel go play dressup in bfa" as if player avatar customization hasn't been a near and dear part of the game for most players since day one. It's a non-argument.
---
Lol yeah nice try. Buddy, stop trolling reddit.
---
Noone who is right minded supports sharding/phasing.
---
Yeah I know that I don't use A and D for turning unless my right hand is off the mouse, but Q and E feel perfectly natural for me for using strafe.
---
Point taken. While I do agree that the game should be kept as original as possible, I also think that basic flaws in the game should be sorted out, such as the absolute uselesness of most craftables.   
---
Limiting "Immersive improvements" to such implementations would'nt affect gameplay for the hardcore or semi-dedicated players, but would make a world of difference for those of us who are now grown and have limited playtime, but still ache for the classic nostalgia feeling.
---
Nope the chances are 50%. Either it happens or it doesn't, as with everything
---
kick, punch, it's all in your mind
---
That only goes for 1st characters, or people who are always broke in game and don;t know how to make money.
---
My alts are often wasting obscene amounts of gold for trivial upgrades, just because I enjoy an easy time leveling, or questing way above my level, and I need the best gear available to do that.  
---
now the point of OP is, that these craftable sets are (almost) NEVER the optimal choice for these big spender type of players, thus they are crafted (almost) never.   If they were slightly better (NOTE we are NOT asking for Bis items, just a little bit better)  people would actually make them, sell them and use them.  
---
Basically there would be more variety in the game with the same amount of items because   more would be used.   It;s not even asking for NEW things, just upgrading some stuff from 'utter crap status' to 'well, I would not be ashamed to use this status' 
---
I'll just go with the same size of Vanilla servers
---
1 serving is recommended before MC
---
You guys know there’s a lot more to Vanilla than being top dps in raids.  Just saying. You can definitely fish in ret spec. 
---
For 5 mans just announce that you don't know your away around and 99% of the people will be happy to show you around. 
---
For raids you'll have to do your research if you've never done them. 
---
Youre going to want to get a pet like a Carrion Bird from westfall to so you can learn screech and teach it to your owl. Screech is OP.
---
You're welcome.  
---
any idea how/if I can make it a fold-down message? quite a wall of text lol
---
Lucky Horde, you guys can hook up together so easily.
---
Like there isn’t a discord full of people looking for normal builds?
---
Nah only troll and orc got weapon spec on horde side. Orcs get axe and trolls get throwing/ bow.
---
I agee!  Would have been funny if they added a (Cave) next to those quests in the Quest Log :)
---
Would have been even more cool if they were mini-instances designed and only playable solo.  Maybe throw a small chance of a rare item dropping from a boss at the end?  Now I'm just daydreaming!
---
Played a Druid in vanilla and TBC. That’s exactly how it felt to me. 
---
  Spirit of Zandalar
---
* Since 1.11 it no longer persists through death.
---
There is no world buff that persists throught death or i'm missing something :o ?
---
People make it out to be much worse than it actually is. They can break the fear ONCE. You have plenty of other tools as a warlock and it's definitely not game over just because of a single racial.
---
In premade PvP Warlocks are still beastly and WotF doesn't even matter that much anymore, and in World PvP locks still have plenty options to mess up rogues.
---
As soon as the later raids open, there isn't really any class that can stop a warlock anymore by the way, so I can't really so why people would NOT roll a warlock. People are so afraid of some racial it's ridiculous.
---
Perfectly fine with me though, I'll get to be one of the very few alliance warlocks then. :3
---
I have no idea if you could integrate Alexa, but you could definitely use [Voice Attack](https://voiceattack.com/).
---
Seal of Fury was in launch. It used to make rank 1 consecrate a threat monster at level 60. 
---
OP isn’t talking fresh off the grind 60’s, he’s talking “I ran the numbers through a spreadsheet, grabbed all these world buffs, and under ideal conditions I do big numbers.”  Great!  Glad your having fun.  Show me the numbers, and I’ll consider whether you can run with us.  You may be able to if you outshine the facerolling idiot we bring along with the so-called ideal spec but can’t be bothered to move out of the fire, but even then you’re fighting for scraps because everyone who gets twice the DPS from a drop has priority on your meme spec.  
---
Sounds like your first mouse of that kind? It can take some time to warm up your hand to it.
---
I probably would if it gave enough time for more than the tryhards to clear content.
---
No.   Just get a disenchanter alt
---
ud is the better pvp healer as well and shadow is aguable depending on the matchup
---
It's comments like the one you're responding to that make it extremely obvious Blizzard shouldn't try and fuck with the game's design beyond what was already in vanilla. Weird, underpowered flavor-items are an integral part of good loot-hunt games -- Diablo 2, Torchlight 2, vanilla WoW, and several other games feature odd items that are niche at best. As you already pointed out, that's far better than the items being streamlined to try and ensure something resembling semi-linear power progression across the entire loot pool. 
---
I imagine they would. I don’t think blizzard decided to make classic in hopes of repeating the entire game cycle again from the start, forcing every player into the next iteration of the game. They know people want vanilla back because that is where they want to stay, but they will probably also realize many players feel the same way about TBC and Wrath. My best guess is that if they decide to introduce the original trilogy again, there would be a system in place to transfer your character over to the new expansion, or maybe even make a copy of your character. That would allow everyone to remain on the server they are most happy with
---
In dungeons, the best tanks are rolling tanks.  Fight/walk backwards, keep an eye on your teams mana, especially healer.  Pull next group as the last pull is 80% dead.  No point in downtime if not needed.
---
Just print out maps/watch youtube videos and youll be fine
---
Whoosh.
---
Teldrassil is such a breathtaking place, one of the few reason i wanted to move to alliance....
---
If you're playing on launch day, how will you know what the server pop is? That being said, you won't be able to see the true stable population until a month or two down the road when the "tourists" are gone. 
---
I think this is right unless something hits a snag. I think they want people *playing* during the summer if they can. 
---
I think the most important skill I've gained 14 years later isn't classic specific. I learned how to experiment to find what works best and when, what to look for and what are the right questions to ask. Inexperienced back then as I was, I would say that I was ignorant of my ignorance, which was what I believe holds players back the most. If you don't know that you don't know something, then you never seek answers.
---
If you are interested in alliance, hop on https://discord.gg/SsKH6rX.
---
Thank you for the educated replay. A breath of fresh air!
---
I swear, during one X-pack, they totally had mace spec. Maybe it was +expertise in wotlk?
---
Yeah holy strike was an on-next-swing attack but there was also Crusader Strike that was instant weapon damage as holy and it applied the stacking Crusader debuff, like a holy version of Sunder Armor. Scarlet Crusader NPCs in the game still have it.
---
My brother and I played the free version of Destiny 2 a decent chunk, and did a Nightfall mission meant for 3 people of higher ilvl with just the two of us. We took forever to get to the final boss, and wipe on him for over an hour before quitting due to frustration. 
---
The next day, we queue'd into a regular dungeon and got the same place...except with a more normal itemlevel and a full party. It was so bloody easy, that the place actually felt 7x smaller at least. The fights that we'd die to or take 3-5 minutes to finish were replaced with a 10 second run-by.   
---
You don't need to play Destiny 2 to understand the difference in feeling. This was initially what LFR did to WoW; it destroyed the mystique of raiding. 
---
Now to the main point: I remember criticizing Blizzard's new 5man philosophy on speed-runs, which I believe started in MoP (could be wrong) and has extended into Mythic +.
---
**TL;DR**: Speed running takes more away from dungeons than it gives; it's essentially the equivalent of adding flying mounts: no one sees or cares where they are. I have never found it fun, and wish WoW never went down the route of making everything about speed. 
---
Vanilla dungeons felt epic to me, and I can barely remember most of the ones past WoTLK.
---
Are you not allowed to use macros from outside the game client? I would think that having alexa use a macro of /cast firebolt wouldnt be much different from having a button on a gaming mouse do the same thing, but am not sure. 
---
My exact same feeling..
---
also play in first person.  SOOOOO fun
---
So, I played vanilla when I was a young lad who hadn't really a clue what he was doing. My first char was a hunter, but I never got further than level 48-ish before TBC hit because I was also an altaholic. I played off and on in the other expansions, never for more than a few months at a time, the magic of vanilla was just gone. 
---
Now I'm looking to play a class that suits my needs, but I can't really decide. Here's what I'd like to do:  
---
\- No world pvp, it just doesn't really interest me. If I want to pvp I'll do a battleground.  
---
\- Probably no raiding. My schedule is erratic so I can't promise 3-4 hour blocks in advance. If I do any raiding at all it'll be casual and sporadic.   
---
\- I'd like to do 5-man dungeons often. My favourite memories are from deadmines and scarlet monastary.   
---
\- I'd like to make dosh. Moolah. e-m-o-n-e, loadsamoney. Well, at least so I can comfortably buy whatever takes my fancy and I can slide some to newbie guild members. My original plan was either herbalism+skinning+mining+fishing or herb+alch+fishing, plus some gold farming in between. 
---
\- I've always dps'ed. I briefly tanked on a private server, even in a few raids, but it's way too stressful for me. I'd really like to try my hand at healing this time around.   
---
It's mostly that last point, healing, which is tripping me up. The other points taken together would just be a "I should probably roll hunter/mage", but with the healing I just don't know. I'll be rolling alliance, so shaman is out. Is there a class which can reasonably do all of this? Or am I going to have to go healer + alt. The original plan is to not have an alt and go full on for my main char, but I'm not completely ruling out making an alt somewhere down the line. 
---
fuck lol rip wb runs
---
They will, otherwise they'd just end up with another community of people that want classic back. 
---
What do you mean? You're saying that this macro wouldn't work on abilities which primary ability was on cooldown, e.g. Gouge in this example (10 seconds):  
---
&gt; /script if not IsCurrentAction(24) then UseAction(24) end;  
---
/cast Gouge  
---
In the demonstration my autoattack was bound to button 24 and I never initiated any autoattack except for spamming Gouge, which means that the macro clearly works? Or am I missing something?
---
1. If it was me - Lock. 
---
2. I enjoy lock, rogue has far more action, lock is more micro management.   
---
3. Rogues and locks ramp up very well to late end game.   
---
4. Locks will have slight more edge on raids and definitely more edge on groups. SS &amp; summon are super useful.
---
rekt
---
Glorious
---
Lol the majority of his response wasn't even about Alexa.  He was saying to get a program to recognize a key word and press a button when it was said.
---
I wouldn't want to go back with what I know...but if I could change one thing, it'd be to actually research a rotation and build for my warlock. 
---
Part of me wishes that the different races had had *really* different racials that dramatically change how you play as, with, and against each race and how you value different pieces of gear. If I play as a Tauren I want to feel like an unstoppable juggernaut. If I'm an Undead I want to actively flee from Paladins and seek out enemy Warlocks and Shadowpriests. If I'm a Gnome I want to use daggers and small swords not because of a simple racial but because the itemization of them tends to match the itemization I'm looking for.
---
We have a great bunch of people over at our guild discord. https://discord.gg/SsKH6rX
---
Hop on and message me (yoko)
---
Blizzard has stated they regret all of those features pretty much. Classic wouldn't make the same mistake because it actually costed them money.
---
herb skinning mining
---
u can only pick 2 of those
---
It's a niche "history of PVP" panel. They won't give us a classic date.
---
Would love to be wrong on this, believe me, but no.
---
It does kind of suck but if memory serves not every trinket broke fear so it's not all bad. And it isn't like they can WoTF every fear.
---
Plus it makes Alliance side warlock more uncommon which is great for those of us rolling Alliance side warlocks.
---
&gt; New graveyards have been added to many zones. 
---
There was a time with even less graveyards?
---
I'd be the best hunter on the server, probably.
---
How effective is half elemental half resto shaman for PVE and PVP? I want a healing class that is also capable of doing some damage and carrying battle grounds on my own, while being efficient in raiding.
---
Someone said it was proven false.  Did you not read the chain?
---
Heres how to replicate: 
---
1. macro the script action to something with a cooldown, like Judgement or Mortal Strike.
---
2. go to the deeprun tram or anyplace where there are several critters close together.
---
3. use the macro, which will onshot the critter and place your ability on cooldown.
---
4. target the next macro before cooldown is over and try the macro again, observing that nothing happens.
---
I don't think so, I remember they changed the brackets to 10-19 because the original bracket, 11-20, the level 20 players had a massive advantage (same with 21-30 etc...).
---
&gt;  I'm afraid of battling the wave of mages and priests for gear 
---
everyone has a lot of competition unless u are nr1 ie the main tank of the raid
---
I really dont think one can go wrong with warlock
---
1. 32
---
2. I haven't played WoW in years.  Closest thing I play now is Diablo 3.
---
3. I think the biggest thing holding me back is the lack of mobility.  Everyone keeps talking about clicking hindering mobility, but with clicking I never have to take my fingers off of W, Q, &amp; E.
---
4. Does not being a touch typist count?  This is likely a related issue, since typing properly is so much slower at first that I don't have the patience to do it when I just want to get shit done.
---
iirc warlock mounts were spells that cost mana, and were subject to all of the counters that normal spellcasting is subject to. Notably this includes being out of mana, delaying mana regeneration, being silenced, having that school of magic "disarmed" by a shield bash etc.
---
The quest and mount are cool but there are practical considerations as well.
---
I have Q and E binded to skills now. I just use right click+A/D to strafe. Right click is pressed 99% of the time so I can move the camera anyway.
---
I seriously don't understand the need for strafe keybinds.
---
I'll join the one RP-PvP server they ad... \*cough\*
---
Hopefully it's at least med pop. 
---
I really enjoyed all the NE Zones in Kalimdor and that feeling of living out of that continent and then visiting the eastern kingdoms every now and then. Felt amazing! 
---
I mean, I used to be NoChanges, but now that I’ve heard this...
---
You are always better off buying Blue BoE's post 1.10 itemization update or just getting easier Raid / PvP rank gear
---
The Dungeon Set 2 is pointless to get when it is canonically available.
---
Ashenvale - Barrens 
---
Early 60 pre dm you might want to go full resto. Ele hybrid doesn't fully launch off til aq20 gear. You can still do more instant damage then any other healer due to nature's swiftness and elemental mastery
---
There will be 100% speed mounts, just not from Warlock or Paladin quests. I think we're on the same page.
---
World of Roguecraft was always fake news.  The devs knew it too- they eventually buffed non-naked rogues as a result of it.
---
&gt; I also feel like there will be too many Warriors to find dungeon
---
tank them urself and boom all u need is a healer ( not even specd right) and any random dps which are a dime a dozen
---
warrior rotation is fun enough, better than magers and warlocks anyway. its a priority system I think same for tanking.
---
for raids yeah its trickier but there are also lots of raid slots for warriors cuz they are the best dps and the main tanks.. and if u did the 5man tank enough then u got all the preraid bis and it puts u ahead of the average btw that gear will last a long time
---
I’m not sure that is the mentality. I think it’s just that Activision-Blizzard would need to pay community managers to work on things like this. Unfortunately Activision-Blizzard has discovered that firing “non-essential” employees is a good way to direct more money to shareholders in the short term. 
---
I mean, I would love to be paid to work on community management for blizzard, considering how many of their games I love, yet at the same time I would hate it because I would have no job security. 
---
When you used judgement with it, was it similar to taunt?
---
I will use a guide as a loose outline of what zone or quest hub to go to next, but won't follow it like a check list.
---
Does the ability make a difference, isn't it irrelevant as long as it has a cooldown? Because I just tried (there's plenty of chicken critters in Brill), and oneshotted the first chicken placing Gouge on cooldown, went to the other chicken right afterwards while Gouge was on cooldown and it started autoattacking?
---
Giant overblown populations lead to very adverse gameplay changes such as needing dynamic respawns and massively inflated economies.
---
I'll take 2-3k pop server caps with regional locks anyday.
---
Undead used to actually be undead, and all the priest / paladin spells that were undead exclusive could be used against them.  They were made regular humanoids in an early patch, but I always thought it was way cooler before.
---
I was under the impression the same mechanic that made both hunter and rogue more complex at high level play was timing their skill usage around auto attacks to optimize swing timer resets.
---
Yea, I wonder how people think they have any choice. Are they going to sit on their hands for a month. Doubt it.
---
I'm just going to pick a PvE EST server with the name I like the most. When things stabilize, consider a paid server swap if they are going to allow it and I feel I need it. Otherwise count on blizz to keep pop balanced with merges.
---
That's very cool. I guess they thought those abilities were too similar to what warriors already had so they removed them. 
---
I was looking at the Scimitar.  I use a Corsair M65 Pro, so it seemed like the natural transition.
---
1) Vs good mages it never works..
---
2) even when i manage to cancel my cast, server never registers and i get countered anyway
---
PW:Shield inhibits rage generation keep that in mind. 
---
&gt; Is it easier to get a spot in groups/raids as lock? 
---
much easier
---
I'm currently remembering how poorly crafting professions scale with toon level. My level 26 priest just learned how to craft woolen shoulders. They're common quality. With no stats. My back piece? 2 spirit if I recall correctly. Why don't I craft something better? Because it requires silk cloth which is primarily obtained in scarlet monestary which is way to high for a level 26.
---
Thanks for the quick and constructive reply. 
---
Whoops, that + was supposed to be a /. My bad for trying type too fast.
---
It's 1024x768 tho. I played Vanilla in 1280x1024 iirc
---
if you hit something hard enough it may as well have been
---
People overvalue perception so much in vanilla IMO. It's not a passive, it's a very long cooldown, short duration. You mainly use it in duels, or if you hear the stealth sound. Maybe it'll help if a rogue vanishes, tho I think while the vanish effect is still up they are invisible, not stealthed (correct me if this is wrong) I dunno, not worth it to me. I'd rather have the 1 minute CD escape artist, +engineering, +int.  
---
As /u/Serasangel laid out, a hunter can get higher anyway, and perception gets you to level 74 for 20 seconds. Gnome you can get to 70 without perception. Not worth it to me personally.
---
I actually fall into the same kind of position you are in. I started as a rogue in vanilla and was a scrub. I didn’t achieve the success you had at the class even into TBC though. I guess I was just your average player at the time. It wasn’t until wrath that I rerolled with a good friend (who picked up rogue again ironically) and gave priest a try. I learned the mechanics, dug up every guide I could find, and ended up being a 2400 arena rating disc. The success followed me into later expansions and was the renowned healer out of my group of IRL friends. Ever since I’ve loved healers and support roles in general. I plan on continuing that into classic, albeit I haven’t quite decided if I want to do priest or R shammy. If you are like me, then you probably find a lot of enjoyment out of being one of the most “desired” players out of your inner group. Someone the guild/your friends can always rely on. I think you would find more of that as a healer in classic since a vast majority of players will probably roll rogue. Everyone needs heals for their dungeons and being good at that role will build a reputation for yourself quick. I do find myself missing that dps roll sometimes and have dabbled in Mage and warlock to relive that shot calling experience, but I know healer is what I will enjoy most come classic
---
Why do you need your pinky free?
---
MOAR DOTS? . . . . . 
---
Not that I know of, maybe the GCD is a factor though. Does Gouge trigger the gcd?
---
I know it can be easier as a dwarf for the racial but beware u cant do it during shadowform 
---
Maybe its a me playing vs russians on a worldwide server issue
---
It's impossible to *prove* that it was fake unless you've got actual evidence that Blizzard 100% will not be announcing a classic date at an unrelated history of PVP panel.
---
I think what msbr\_ meant was the same thing I said, other posters in that forum pointed out that the OP had a history of posting BS "leaks". That technically doesn't disprove anything, it just means that it's more than likely also BS, which was obvious from the start anyway. You should never have to disprove something that was never proven to begin with. 
---
Shadowguard is arguably a better shadow racial ability for horde.  It procs blackout, and it is not as easily dispelled.
---
but can u make it if u dont know the kiting techniques?
---
I also click until this day and killed every raidboss since classic before the next Expansion came out. I wouldn't be too concerned. 
---
Its more that it made the Paladin a viable alternative to a Warrior as a plate DPS/Tank class and the two lead designers left around launch time were complete twats about that sort of thing. 
---
In original AV, I would ask for a BoP and heals, jump into giant mass of people and lay on hellfire. Lots of fun, unless they saw it coming. If you did it in conjunction with a lot of arcane exploding mages, you could really cause some havoc.  
---
Those MMO mice have so many buttons, I just feel like it would be hard to not hit the wrong ones by accident.  This would be the most natural way for me to play though, because part of the reason for clicking is that my fingers feel glued to W, Q, &amp; E to not stand in the fire and shit.
---
Agree'd with this, and would add:  
---
Don't judge an entire class/spec by specific individuals, or visa-versa, don't let the past-perceptions of a class/spec deter you from letting an individual show you what they can do!  
---
Make your judgements by the individual, rather than by perceived bias. 
---
4-5k population is ideal.
---
Imo above 5k u cause financial inflation and will change the dynamic of the game... But Below 3k it might seem fine at start but 7-10 months in there will be many PVP issues and amssive queues. Imo 4,500 will be ideal
---
That’s what I always told myself on P servers. You’ll have a lot more success with jukes once the servers are back in blizzards hands 
---
You don't understand. It's not about refreshing your world buff, it's about not even having it in the first place. What happens if a guild pops ony an hour before your raid is even scheduled to start? Are you going to postpone your raid until the world buff cooldown is over? Is the entire guild required to be AFK at org at all times to make sure they never miss a buff? People are so used to private server bugs that the thought of playing without them doesn't even cross their mind. Tanks aren't supposed to have access to a 25% damage buff whenever they want. You're not supposed to have ony/nef buff whenever you want. All the mob stats are guessed and we have no idea what any of it is supposed to be. How many DPS in the raid are going to be threat capped without world buffs? Will the melee be threat capped with proper armor values? You can't base everything on private servers.
---
While sippin tea.
---
troll master race confirmed
---
They will rename Classic to "Peaches and Cream" as a play on Vanilla and will made hunters the defacto tank. 
---
Higher pop also makes raiding more available. Many people couldn't get through naxx because there wasn't a big enough pool of players to pull together to make strong enough guilds. Those 15k pop servers developed the high end meta of Vanilla more in 2 years than the previous 12 years did it feels like.
---
I loved HoMM3, but never really played it online.  How was it unbalanced?

Woooooooo.  Good lord.  You need a gig or something.

Someone said the rumor was proven false.  You shouldn't have to prove it false but if you say it was proven false you should back it up.

You can find resist calculators for vanilla online, but it's all "tiered" per se. You'll get say 100 fire resist and now take a10% less fire damage. But you may need 300 to have a chance to fully resist fire damage.
---
That's why it isn't feasible really for your strategy
---
Based on the state of the demo, they better plan a 2 month beta, so at this point I'm thinking late summer. 
---
Remember finding the bugs is only a small piece of the puzzle. Can often take a long time to fix. And fixing things often can break other things or bring to light other issues. And with a small dev team, if even just 100 bugs are reported, that's probably a month of work easily. Have to QA those fixes, update the beta, and make sure they are stable.
---
You're pretty spot on, it's about timing with auto attacks. Difference is timing with hunter is way easier because pace of shots versus pace of attacks with two melee weapons. Rogue you also get to be more mobile in trying to stay behind the boss, moving with the tank. hunter you pretty much stand in the same shot and repeat your rotation until death. 
---
I've never heard anyone call hunter rotations complex, theres small tweaks based on the RoF for the bow or gun, otherwise it's super basic. 
---
You both get a nickel in a jar for being complete jaggoffs
---
Pick a server named after a well known lore character and you can almost be guaranteed it will be high population. Low population is harder to guess at but just pick more general names like Eredar. 
---
Lets hope so.. fake casting is very satisfying... when it works 😅
---
&gt;Copper and Silver - I miss money being a relevant aspect of the game. The feeling of earning a few silver so that you can get a 6 slot bag or afford training. It’s a dimension that’s been lost due to hyperinflation up till BFA.
---
this is only really relevant for your first character until you have your mount, and not relevant at all to paladins/warlocks.
---
DON'T TAKE SOUL HARVESTER! TAKE THE TRINKET!! Its too good, was used well into BC.
---
Mouse wheel macro!
---
Yeah it's on gcd.
---
I was on nazjatar, horde side.
---
By the time server merges came around, thered be MAYBE 5 people in org, and the AH was so bare i was selling wool cloth for 2k a stack.
---
Thanks. It sounds like I'm better off just going for the PVP set. Too bad they release the dungeon sets so late.
---
I think you replied to the wrong comment
---
Yep reserved from the very beginning with [Foreman's Blackjack] lol
---
Thanks so much, I read it all and have a better understanding. 
---
Not anymore since they re-added it, no?
---
High end guilds yes, but it won't be the standard issue for every raider like it is on private servers 
---
Look.at you with that fire wand
---
Reasons?
---
Berserking only ever affects one spell for shadow priest. UD is just better all around.
---
Yep I'm with you on that !
---
Got a laugh out of me with this one.
---
Hi, /u/BigGermanGuy
---
Elwynn Forest is such a beautiful start to leveling. Then you go to Westfall and then Duskwood, which are so depressing lol. Luckily you can go to Redridge or Loch Modan easily to mix it up.
---
Would actually love to have it as respeccing is what I dislike most about Vanilla, but it is 100% not going to happen.
---
Practically, there’s not a problem. It follows the spirit of the law.
---
Technically, Blizz could see it as an external application pressing commands for you. It looks like botting, even though it’s not. 
---
In a 1vs1 PvP as a mage, I always felt like I don't ever want to take my fingers off of movement keys.  Strafe is often the only thing keeping me alive.  Same for raids.  Well, in raids it's a bit different.  For Patchwork style fights, I spam my main nuke with the keyboard just because it's easier to play with one hand.
---
Yeah, I didn't, I just said it wasn't a leak like you claimed. I can make up any old horse shit and call it a leak, doesn't make it a leak. I don't get what you're even arguing at this point, move on. 
---
I played on public almost the entire time vanilla was out, raiding.  We used to have at least 1 Rey paladin for BWL/MC/ZG/AQ.  I can’t remember which boss it was, but in my time on a private server there was 1 boss in Naxx we always had a prot paladin!  I remember it being so important to the raid that we actually would have a spare geared up just In case.  Anyone else remember this?
---
Odds are about things having more of a tendency to happen. If I put 5 checkers 4 black and 1 red in a bag and retrieved one at random I wouldn't have a 50% chance of getting a red checker.
---
So Blizzard is going to PAX. What can we expect from them?
---
Here is what has been confirmed through various sources:
---
- Classic release date announcement, Classic demo from BlizzCon playable on game floor
---
- 8.2 Mechagon and Nazjatar zone reveal and PTR playable on game floor
---
- Announcement that they decided to port Diablo: Immortal to PC
---
- Warcraft 3: Reforged map reveals with demo announcement
---
- No Overwatch, HotS or Starcraft floor presence outside of logos/devs/panel
---
Also, Thursday is gonna be huge for Diablo fans.
---
That is all I can say for now.

I read BoA and was ready to downvote anticipating some schmuck asking for Bind on Account gear. &gt;:(
---
Thats kind of what I was thinking. And with all the customer support layoffs I wouldnt want to test my luck appealing that it wasnt botting if I got flagged as a bot. 
---
You will have to work far harder to will be a lot worse than everyone else.
---
Best example I can give you real quick:  
---
https://streamable.com/mdivj  
---
Still not sure if that's exactly what you wanted, but that macro have always seemed to work perfectly fine for me at least.
---
My thoughts exactly. The only way to tell if a huge chunk of people will be somewhere at launch is if a popular streamer broadcasts that they chose that realm beforehand.
---
I do understand. Top guilds will find ways to get world buffs for their raids. Just like they did in Vanilla. Be that raiding at specific times, or colluding with other guilds. To be honest, that buff is probably going to drop every 2 hours on the dot by the time we are progressing into BWL. It will not be hard to catch a buff before raid.
---
How many DPS in the raid are going to be threat capped without world buffs?
---
If the tank doesn't have world buffs, threat issues will be just as bad as with world buffs, if not worse.
---
Tanks aren't supposed to have access to a 25% damage buff whenever they want.
---
Fury Prot still is more threat without Enrage.
---
Will the melee be threat capped with proper armor values? 
---
Well, did you play Vanilla? If you don't remember threat issues in Vanilla, I doubt you played. But, yes, this COULD be different than private servers. We are not sure of the tank meta and what it will be, as I just said in my previous post. 
---
To quote myself :
---
"It could play out in a number of ways. But if you think about it, it's very likely to still be a viable spec in Vanilla." (I mean Classic not Vanilla)
---
None of what you have said is actually indicative that there will be a significant difference in threat in Classic.
---
sure you would, either you would get the red one of you wouldnt - 50%
---
What are they?
---
If it doesn't work vs a mage he's better than you. It should read "it doesn't work vs mages better than me". If you're as good at fake casting as he is at spell locking then it's a fair fight, nobody has the advantage here.
---
If server doesn't register it's because youøre playing on a private server vs people from god knows where.
---
As long as someone is marking mobs it's no problem. If you don't know the dungeon, give someone else lead so they can mark. Then you'll know where to go and everyone else will know what to hit/CC. Mob marking is half the battle in 5mans.
---
I have way less time to play then I did when I was 12 so here is my master plan...
---
Orc Hunter while following [Joana's Speed Leveling Guide](https://www.joanasworld.com/). Do some PvP and Casual raiding at 60. Would like to finish BWL and maybe try some AQ. 
---
I was worried that too many people would roll hunter but based on the surveys i have seen recently looks like it wouldn't be too hard to find a raid spot as a hunter?
---
Why is everyone saying go to Durotar? Durotar has leveling gaps that you need to grind out due to lack of quests - biggest gap being level 6 where there's just nothing since the human killin' and crab stompin' quests are level 7.
---
Other than ST. That place drove me nuts.
---
Counterpoint: No on equips that trinket while raiding, ever, but in MC a warlock can use the harvester for the +hit, aiding progression.
---
Do you care about getting the occasional free shard while soloing, or do you care more about raid progression?
---
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half.
---
That's a good point.  I think this is a good starting point for me, along with binding extra mouse buttons.
---
they're all going to be capped at around 3K. There's no way of knowing which will be the "high pop" servers until after the initial crush dies down.
---
People do understand this. Hunter mainspec comes before warrior off spec, but 2H fury warrior is very good for the early raids because there aren’t really any good 1 handers in MC. The warrior is based mostly around their weapon damage, so they have priority on melee weapons for main spec over hunters, just as hunters have priority for ranged.
---
Ah okay, thanks
---
The argument that you'll replace the staff but never the trinket doesn't make sense to me. Being able to generate a shard every now and then is not valuable to me at all.
---
Of course not. It wasnt part of vanilla. It wasnt even part of TBC. Why in the hell one would think classic wow would have dual spec blows my mind.
---
Did they? I remember when I stopped playing early BFA it was unobtainable via drops and was only circulating as a BOE tradeable. 
---
No, you didn't, but you got involved in a conversation that did.  You need to read more or not be so crazy.
---
Hi, /u/Omnix_NerZ
---
Yeah, I get that. The limitations of speech recognition would still be the same, I was using Alexa as that’s what had already been discussed and was mentioned in his comment. 
---
The fact is that, beyond the coolness factor, it wouldn’t be an advantage at all. I don’t really know what point you were trying to make. 
---
The 12 thumb button one?  That seems like a lot for one finger.  I think the hex one might be a lot easier.
---
Spirit of Aquementas
---
Songstone of Ironforge
---
The most important advice to fight huntardism is to MAKE KEYBINDS for Pet Attack and Pet Passive in your easiest to reach spot (mine are the thumb up/down buttons of my mouse) and to ALWAYS keep your pet's attack mode on passive. This will ensure it only attacks what you want it to, when you want it to.
---
Literally none of these are "confirmed".
---
Rank 1 Rain of Fire or Hellfire stuns when searching for Rogues could be game winning.  If you can get off a Soul Fire and it stuns as a deep destro build it's basically a 25% chance to instantly win a fight.
---
It's great for casual PvP and goofing around.  Very fun but not in any serious PvP builds.
---
Raided Naxx up to 4horsemen in vanilla (non-private server) as alliance. Nobody ever even fielded the idea of a prot paladin in a serious manner.
---
Keep in mind that the Tier 0.5 is primarily designed for non-raiders. By the time it is available, the Tier 1 and Tier 2 class sets from raiding are much better.
---
God I fucking miss Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb.
---
They added battlemasters in the major cities at some point in vanilla, allowing you to queue from there as well.  Queue from anywhere was never part of vanilla iirc.
---
Seems ez enough
---
Many.

Hi, /u/creib_

"OP announcing a "leak" that Legion is called Eye of Azshara

OP posting a fake link to a terrible Eye of Azshara photoshop job.
---
OP confirming that Legion beta was "soon" in August 2015 (it wouldn't be released until April 2016)
---
But this one's legit boys"
---
It's also insanely difficult to get the .5 sets without help from geared players.
---
I always saw them as something geared players in a guild helped their non raiding casual guildmates get.
---
I know almost no one that was in a tier 0 geared group that was able to upgrade to .5 without any help from people with better gear.
---
Completing the quest line is mega expensive. You'll spend a lot more time farming gold than you will running dungeons.
---
A reason is a cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event. But that's not important right now.
---
72 Man raids in Everquesr were like that. The Officer in charge set up his macro with a whole book-load of chat on what we were supposed to do when the raids started.
---
I remember it being a big deal cause people gave asmongold one then he went to go farm one and it was just absolutely crowded on every realm he hopped to
---
that's a common misconception. Vanish is a form of stealth and it is a lower stealth level than the default level based stealth. The main benefit is that the very first second - if I remember it correctly the advanced combat log spell id name was vanish purge - makes you immune to stealth detection (aside from the bugs that plagued the mechanic of pets and npcs still autoattacking you out of stealth, but that was a netcode related issue for the most part)
---
The other thing about stealth detect is - the more the better.
---
That sounds like a silly statement, but it is easy to understand when you try to stealth around higher lvl npcs. A single level makes a monstrous difference. In some cases (low lvl runs through arathi for example) you end up pulling npcs from behind hills despite being stealthed just because one of the buggers spawned one or two lvls higher than his friends.
---
SWC EU? Represent.
---
Alliance, that is..
---
Oh I know
---
I’m really curious if they’ll make new server names or use old ones 
---
I can get behind this. 
---
It's not that it wouldn't be allowed, rather what the program would have to do (automate keys) would be similar to a bot's action and could be seen as sketchy to blizzard's anticheat.
---
I always fired tranquilizing shot right from the spell book in MC. Basically because I never had to use it anywhere else and I was to lazy to find a good spot in the hud. I know.. hunters amiright
---
Luxembourg’s Chew Toys it is! 
---
Look at that draw distance from those players.. in retail they phase out if you move 10 meter away from them
---
The breakdown you guys did on whether 1.12 AV is right for this game was so well done. You put my exact thoughts into words. Well done guys. Keep the content coming Josh!
---
correct me if I'm wrong but the massive buff to perception came during 2.4 if I'm not completely going senile here. (which is a possibility :p)
---
Herbs should be consumeable.
---
So Wyrmrest Accord then.
---
&gt; What a phenomenal way for Blizzard to get me to keep my promise to never spend another cent on a Blizzard product.
---
Honestly part of me agrees with this sentiment. That being said. Part of me still feels like being able to farm gold in an instance. Kind of does not fit with the rest of classic. I sure do like doing it though lol.
---
&gt;  hardest times finding a raid spot.
---
but if u did got a spot its gonna be easy to get tier gear cuz u compete with few hunters
---
same for druids
---
battlemasters will end up getting us city shards
---
There's so many different gaming mice, you don't have to get one that has a million buttons. I use the g700s (I think it's discontinued now sadly, the g602 looks pretty similar but it's wireless only) with 4 thumb buttons and 3 pointer finger buttons and it's perfect without being overwhelming. 
---
The 'vanish purge' is mostly what I was referring to! I know that staying stealth with vanish isn't invsibility the whole time haha, thanks for clarifying.  
---
Yeah I realize the higher the better, but perception you have to know the rogue is there already anyway.
---
Oh, yeah, 2 rings that look the same sitting on top of each other with statues that have to be activated in the right order?  All this behind an open world section that is a maze to navigate just to get to the instance portal?  
---
I LOVE sunken temple.

I would roll 5 ret paladins and 1 prot paladin in my raids and have them all judge different ranks of Crusader on the boss, and proceed to destroy it with absurd levels of holy damage. 
---
&gt; Whatever the Alliance says at that point!
---
I'm pretty sure they say something like "Don't ask, don't tell." I don't know what it means but it's pretty important to them.
---
So dope
---
A lot of them are blood elves, but it's mostly because Blizzard could have had a small faction of neutral elves that could assist both sides with the inevitable upcoming void stuff while also having a narrative about a group of, essentially, ticking time bombs that threaten to turn into eldritch horrors (Alleria included) over the course of several expansions before the last remnant turn en masse and give us a dungeon where we fight the twisted forms of former allies that had been with us for a few years.  
---
except now that Void Elves are a playable race for Alliance only, they can't really do most of that since it can now include a player character, making them either non-existent lorewise or a mary sue "oh I can't be corrupted even though everyone else is" if they do go down that route... so a lot of the edge off the fact that they are dabbling in powers that have been shown to easily corrupt and enthrall those who dabble in them since we know they'll generally be safe from all that. 
---
\*feels like ignoring Silas Darkmoon\*
---
Just like av being the exact same right?
---
What's a jaggoff?
---
But 'sexcoil' isn't a fear. Undead play patterns were fairly predictable when I did Human lock. Fear them, they laugh and pop WotF, then you Coil them then, wait a beat, then start recasting fear. 
---
Whoops.
---
They have stated that they have no intention of having RP-PVP servers. Sorry. 
---
If I may piggyback off of this... how good is full Resto raid spec for healing BGs?
---
Very effective against elementals 
---
There is no way shield slam and one handed weapon specialization gives you more threat than the collective of flurry and Bloodthirst. Never mind enrage and Death Wish and DW specialization and unbridled wrath. Even in average tank gear like Tier 1. You do need enough hit to dual wield though.
---
Just, no. Why would you "expect" Prot to be higher threat? There is absolutely no reason this would be the case.
---
Not even close to the same. The AV were getting WAS in vanilla. 
---
Dual spec didnt exist until AFTER the launch of WotLK. 
---
Would you like to compare more oranges to apples now?
---
tanks for 5mans and healers for raids ( any of them tbh)
---
if u pick alliance priest make it a dwarf
---
cart horse
---
This is 100% what i want to happen.
---
No need to worry about it. As mentioned - the chances of hunters not using the ability because they don't know what it does is relatively high for your typical day to day encounter.
---
try hard premade groups may be another story, but in those you are not going to be the solo murder monster but the crowd control assist for your group
---
Link? 
---
Well, if you are silenced or were just hit with a shield bash, you are in combat anyway and can´t use any mounts.
---
And you are getting your 40 mount for free while many other players spend the whole gold they saved while leveling, that is a big advantages. And when you are 60 you should not really worry about having enough mana for the mount, and if you are really oom you just have to spend one GCD for lifetap.
---
Yes, with rogues, the best way to win as a lock is to just get them off you long enough to be able to Charm them, then heal up and restart the fight. Least how I rememer it anyway.
---
you cant track herbs and mining at the same time but there are 1.12 macros to swap them more easily. Depends on how the macro system works on classic wows legion api if a macro can be made for swapping
---
Ha that asmongold vid was the reason I was under the impression it was unobtainable. Just looked it up and yeah, apparently the mob is surrounded by multiboxing monks on every server AND has a 1.5 to 3 hour respawn timer Fuck that!
---
The first year I played vanilla without knowing there was an in-game amp. I was thirteen navigating from Dun Morogh to Westfall from memory
---
No, you said you were herbing and mining, which can not be tracked at the same time. So did you use a macro to switch tracking.

Diablo Mobile
---
I figured this was the case.  Often times a good majority of the private server bosses had broken mechanics that gave them 3x the normal HP or some kind of overly complex wipe mechanic to”change things up”. I can always drop the extra gold for a respec if I want to PvP(which is exactly what I plan on doing).  I usually heal and farm all my mats religiously!
---
Its not that far from org to wsg entrance.   No need for queue button
---
Mobile Vanilla would be pretty cool IMHO (provided no MTX)
---
I dunno i imagine it could be very useful to throw out 1 or 2 ticks to interrupt a heal if you get a little lucky
---
What's the alternative, like 6% stamina and 6% searing pain crit or something 
---
Pretty sure that they won´t release the quest chain if you have to do a dungeon, that is not released yet. But you can collect the mats that you need for the quest in advance, if they don´t change the quest chain.
---
This. In pvp, especially later into vanilla when a bit more mail +damage and healing gear became available, ele with a touch of resto was an amazing BG spec. Your heals are only slightly weaker than a full resto shaman with the added bonus of being able to nuke targets too. Mana tide totem isn’t amazing for pvp and many of the deep resto talents arnt needed to be effective. Natures swiftness over elemental mastery is the way to go, as this gives you a clutch cooldown to actually make your heals count when they need to. Also has the added bonus of being used for an instant lightning bolt/chain lightning as well. Currently the route I’m debating playing if I don’t end up on priest
---
Cheeky
---
I can relate, but would like to point out:
---
Maybe it's just me, but when I played Vanilla (at least in my case), professions was something that was useful at minimal levels (15ish) and top levels (55+). Everything in between that was mildly useful would cost too much to make, especially when there were better, easier-to-get alternatives in dungeons of your level. This was the case for Leatherworking, Blasksmithing, and to some extent, Tailoring. I remember that if I wanted to level one of those professions, I had to dedicate almost as much time and effort to it as leveling a character, it was brutal. Tailoring had a + because of the bags, so there was some utility to it. Utility professions (Alchemy, Engineering, Enchanting) were a bit more useful, but even they were a nightmare. Do you guys remember the different levels of enchanting rods that you had to get at different phases of enchanting? They were EXPENSIVE, especially the top-tier one that required arcanite bars.  By contrast, I am actually playing retail right now, and all of the "bad" expansions that people like to hate on are the ones that made professions relevant mid-game rather than only beginning and end. I played Legion and BFA and had some useful, relatively cheaply crafted gear.
---
For me, the big things from Classic are class identity (as you mentioned) and also NO SHARDING or PHASING. My god! Watching people (and resource nodes) pop in and out of my world in BFA is frustrating to say the least and at best immersion breaking. If some guy is being an asshole to me in the game while I'm questing or gathering resources, there's a 99% chance I won't come across him anymore because he is from another server, and I can't have that! I have to know that there's a prospect of me getting revenge in the future. Remember how you would see a person's name in your general chat and shift+click it to see the level, class, race, and zone that person is in? Doesn't happen anymore except in the off chance that the person is from your ACTUAL server and not a sharded one. If that person is from a different server, shift clicking will say "0 players online".
---
Don't get me wrong, I still like retail WoW, I just wish it would fix the things that make it terrible. I do love the content in a sense. I love a lot of the post-vanilla races (Worgens, Kul'Tiran humans, Nightborn elves, Dark Iron dwarves, etc.), and even things like transmog have a very useful place in RP servers, but man, I do not like that the world feels like a tear in the fabric of reality with people popping in and out like quantum particles and you feeling like the whole thing is an illusion and everyone around you is AI and you are actually playing a single-player game.
---
Yes, but, allow us to "copy" our 60 toons over, while still leaving the 60 toon playable on classic vanilla.
---
Impale spec still puts 3 points in fury for 3% crit. Yes its worth it.
---
Spam the highest level of flash heal on the tank while watching youtube videos
---
People who undercut on the ah are cheating themselves. Important mats move fast. You can list your small stacks priced higher than the lower priced ones, and once those sell, yours will be the cheapest. Patience pays off every time. The game is a marathon, not a sprint.
---
That's the part about open world pvp whereby rogues, druids and NE have the upper hand. You won't know that they are there unless you are psychic. Which brings us back to the original statement. It all boils down to the player's preference. Some see escape artist as a poor man's FAP. Others see the best invention since sliced bread in it. 
---
and while I know that this is getting off topic a bit. But posts like this make me so giddy for classic. Just the thought that world pvp without flying mounts is going to be a thing again.

Well, I didn't, someone else did. But I misread that as a macro to swap trinkets, and thought he was confused. I've had herbing and mining before. You can build up all the node spots with something like Gatherer, and just manually swap every so often when you are near the node spots.

Actually, Felcloth are constantly in *huge* demand and easy to farm, so with an AH price from 12-16g a piece, you could easily get over 150g/h

Druid. High flexibility. Druids can fill any role in 5 mans. 
---
&gt; - No world pvp, it just doesn't really interest me. If I want to pvp I'll do a battleground.
---
Stealth!
---
&gt; - Probably no raiding. My schedule is erratic so I can't promise 3-4 hour blocks in advance. If I do any raiding at all it'll be casual and sporadic.
---
Druid does everything. Its the multi-alt that shares levels with your main, just change gear!
---
&gt; - I'd like to do 5-man dungeons often. My favourite memories are from deadmines and scarlet monastary.
---
Druids are welcomed in groups (while it is unlikely anyone will be LF1 druid specifically)
---
&gt; - I'd like to make dosh. Moolah. e-m-o-n-e, loadsamoney.

You will learn to use double mouse click-and-hold as a way to move your character then you can release your fingers from WASD to use keybinds. It really isnt too hard and learning to play with keybinds will open a new world for you with how you are able to paly the game. There is for sure a pretty low ceiling on performance when clicking abilities
---
Skill levels have gone up since vanilla, be prepared to get kited to oblivion if you roll a rogue
---
Yup, this makes the most sense for Blizzard just to keep us non-retail players playing.
---
Classic WoW for 2-3 years &gt; classic TBC for \~2 years &gt; fresh classic WoW servers for 2-3 years &gt; fresh TBC servers for \~2 years &gt; etc etc..
---
They can literally just do this until the genre dies out. Easy cash flow from the 1m+ subs that they wouldn't have with only retail and post-Naxx classic servers. The problem will be the amount of different servers that will exists and probably confuse a lot of people.. especially new people, but that's a problem they have to deal with in 5+ years.
---
Lol ur still posting so u fit right in there with us you jaggoff!
---
At this point it becomes a litteral gamble...
---
I see thanks for ur input
---
I would definitely lean toward higher population.
---
I rerolled mid vanilla on a fresh server and while it was awesome through BWL it eventually killed my guild because there wasn't enough players on the server where we were able to progress through AQ40.  We were the only guild on the Horde side who was even past Ragnaros at that time, so there were literally 0 players outside of our guild ready for AQ40.  Once our geared players server xfered to high pop servers it was a wrap, and I had to server xfer a character from my old server to play on the opposite faction to progress.
---
Hunter's cant get higher. First off they cant get perception, but they can benefit from a warlocks paranoia, which doesn't bring them up to a human warlock with perceptions detection anyway.   
---
Perception, paranoia, Catseye goggles, catseye elixir is as high as you'll get. Hunter can get Paranoia, Track hidden, catseye goggles and catseye elixir.
---
Seems weak at first glance but if you factor in the average crit chance of a warrior you can quickly see that it increases your damage significantly. Also you only should lose 2 out of 5 points of crit in Cruelty.
---
Though you lose out on 5% parry which is IMO quite huge. Remember 1% avoidance is worth about 8-9def roughly speaking, so 5% parry is quite huge in terms of value, especially since it also proccs revenge.
---
It's not just patient pulls, it's the mechanics of it, you know? In retail, I press about 4 different buttons on random targets over and over and over again until they are all dead. I want for us to sit there and decide which mob to sap and which to sheep. I want someone to yell out "PATS" when patrols roll up from behind because you forgot about them and pulled the other group. And I want for "bad pulls" to end up with a wipe and the healer having to use the soulstone the lock provided to rez everyone, and I especially want these wipes to happen to make it THAT MUCH MORE SATISFYING when you have a bad pull but everyone in your group is such a good sport that you don't panic, recover, and save the day by having a quick-thinking hunter freeze trap one, the druid healer sleep a dragonkin, and a rogue evasion tank a melee mob while your tank is getting b-rezzed by the druid.
---
Yea vanish doesn't make you immune to stealth detect it just increases your stealth level a ton for the 10 second buff it gives. You're still at mercy of netcode and how in flight spells/swings get resloved.
---
For example at 60 vanish rank 2 gives the caster an additional 360 points of stealth skill or the stealth effectiveness of a level 132 player assuming no other modifiers.

---
How are they going to force every other guild to raid at the same time as them? What's stopping someone from turning in the buff an hour before the raid beings? Are they going to collude with every other guild to set up a buff schedule so it lines up with their raid times? What's stopping some random guild from messing that up?
---
How would threat issues be worse when the tank doesn't have world buffs? More damage means more threat, but what about things like sunder? World buffs don't give sunder more threat. And why would the DPS not being doing less threat too? Are you only giving your tank world buffs or something?
---
According to the threat sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRVNabnxWQoq4Ya_cNDMKuZJwf9zbfzWhe3qf6d08gEk3OuJJ_z_zgERPRaDioAGux14ORx6thE6Hub/pubhtml#) fury does LESS threat than prot without world buffs. So without an on-demand enrage it's going to be even worse than that. And to even pull ahead of prot in the first place you need world buffs, which you can't guarantee.
---
By that logic I better not see any sharding either then.
---
I meant elemental fury, 1 talent point for 100% crit bonus. Minor oops there
---
Yeah there was a segment in there about the hidden link quest or whatever from un'goro thats how i found out about that quest
---
Well it needed that buff. Same went for paranoia. You may remember the old world of roguecraft videos. Those effects did basically nothing in the release version of the game. Like ~ 2 yards vision range aka +5 (1 lvl)
---
Though I don't have any numbers in my head from that time. We weren't that deep into experiments/thottbot diving prior to the boredom that came during hive grinds for aq40. (it took ages even while shoving everything into a human to get the rep up with just 2 guilds actively working on it ~.~)
---
Oh yeah totally, a huge boost to damage
---
Yins jagoffs n'at
---
That I definitely agree with, but I doubt that will be any different this time around. People were lazy and dumb in 2005 and they're lazy and dumb in 2019.
---
Do you boo
---
I also decided against priest, my usual main, to do shaman. That nuke damage, buff variety, chain heal and raid priority is really good stuff
---
#nochanges 
---
It is decided for me then...
---
I shall play an old Dwarf Queen (the one with the grumpy, mad face cuz it is the only right one) 👑 
---
#masterrace
---
I don't think that's true. I can't see a real parallel between those sort of "QOL" features that really just killed it, and wanting your class to be actually playable at end game.
---
To be sure, I am not in favor of major changes like "welfare epics", group finder, etc in classic. I would be in favor of tweaking druid/pally to be viable raid tanks, etc
---
The alternatives aren't impressive if you're already going deep destro yeah.  Probably end up with 7/7/34 with 3 points for whatever you like.
---
I'm a big fan of pyroclasm but I also like to get off lots of soul fires, which could now stun and slow, and like the edge against rogues.
---
I think destro is just for fun anyway.  If you were serious you'd be SM/Ruin or something.
---
Gandalf the ultimate Ninja douche! 
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Ungoro / Burning steps/ winter spring/ silithus 
---
Yep, I've landed on nelf priest too.
---
They can find two dwarves for those few bosses, I played a dwarf for a decade collectively, I want somthing a bit longer this time round. 
---
Yeah, I played R shammy on p servers and really enjoyed it. Problem was, I had to do most of my mat farming on my brothers warlock. Only reason priest is still in contention for me is cause dispel magic is incredible, totally shuts down Frost mages in pvp and such. Also destroying nerds as shadow sounds very appealing. Ugh...choices, choices.....
---
Well in world pvp maybe but in battleground you will often know when there is a rogue around.
---
Really enjoyed listening to Mute and Kevin.
---
A small criticism, i think the narrative of the interview with Mute was a bit off. Mute didn’t make these videos because he loved the class, he made them because he hated them.
---
He wasn’t trying to show skill, but rather the lack of skill.
---
The context for this comes from the premise of the skits mixed within the original videos. There was a general feeling of contempt at the time for rogues that thought they were badass and “ganking gods” and he essentially wanted to shove it in their faces... it’s not you thats good, your class is just overpowered.
---
This is what made that video resonate with a lot of us because it wasn’t just another pvp compilation, it was directly focused at the social behavior of players who felt entitled to being op when threatened with nerfs.
---
It felt a little tone deaf when the other guests were telling him how it inspired him to play a rogue and asking if he would play rogue when he returned. That was the exact opposite of what he was trying to demonstrate and why he bothered to gear his warlock and not a rogue.
---
I still enjoyed hearing from him, but there was a lot of space left to engage with him and the context of the video.
---
If i play a lock I'll be SM/ruin for raiding so yeah destro is for fun
---
I was planning on something like 17/0/34 to play around with pyroclasm.  A bit more glassy a cannon but it could be fun :D 
---
if everything fails the good old \*grab 4 friends/guildmates and farm dungeons till all of you end up hating each other or until you know more about each other than your own wifes/husbands\* ;p
---
Seriously that is up to this day an underrated option. Split the earnings from white/grey. Sell/disenchant unneeded gear and split the profit. It may not be the 'omg 100g per hour' farm, but it will still net a profit - it will help with gearing up - and it earns recipes to either utilize or resell.

Can't find the dungeon finder stuff, but it's out there somewhere. They mention it a lot in a negative way when speaking about Classic though and there was a Blizzcon panel that said no dungeon finder, ever.
---
It's wrong.
---
do u know a video guide for it?
---
Ok.
---
So what line of mental gymnastics did you have to jump through to come to that lol. Fury warriors are insane dps and they pretty much never get enrage while dps'ing. So you really think that enrage is what scales furys damage?
---
Probably Ashenvale. I was just a young orc warrior that had only seen the sunny yellow and orange-ish zones of Durotar and the Barrens. Stepping past the outpost at the northern end of the zone into a dark and eery forest, seeing the contested territory text pop up was something else.
---
You mean exactly what Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland did with Rick and Morty season 3? Tell everyone Season 3 episode 1 is up on Adult Swim, watch everyone say "Haha, nice try, April fools!" and the other half of the people plead with them "No, seriously, go on Adult Swim, it's there!"
---
Good times :P what a great episode that was too... Man, I miss Rick and Morty, when's season 4?
---
I mean it makes sense to a grown up man, maybe you took it personally? "shouldn't be insulted", well technically asking to drag a raid down is insulting, so what goes around comes around? Sakana seemed to say the raid has objective needs, and putting 40 people's time at risk to please 1 of them is insulting. See how that works?
---
because he needed a strawman to demonize. 
---
I will. I don't have a large amount of friends who plan on playing Cassic, so I'll want to join a guild that can get 40+ people on for a raid consistently. 
---
I hope they release classic early summer or mid eventually. If they release it late august or in september I am going to fucking cry 
---
well the reps will eventually be completed while nothing will solve ur racial looks
---
the sword racial is how important tho? 5% more dmg? what if u take a dagger spec?
---
I can only get so hard... top before I get a priapism. 
---
dwarves help vs rogues too
---
also undead priests
---
I think perception is +50, or 10 levels worth of detection
---
Female tauren should get a debuff that lasts until someone milks uou
---
Of course, they should leave the option for original, unchanging servers. I can't see them lasting very long with an alternate progression Classic though.
---
Glad you nipped that in the butt, for all intensive porpoises, it really doesnt madder thou.
---
I have fond memories of this.
---
I do not have fond memories of just looting and running all the way down only to realise I was supposed to do something with what I looted because I was an idiot.

Yeah, I don’t think anyone considered the side effects of LFG. I remember the relief people expressed not having to spam /2.

I love how he tried to literally put the item from his bag onto the plate.  It's just such a natural way of thinking, but has been completely conditioned out of us by playing the game.

I mean, you’re gonna die fast if you’re casting hellfire. But yeah, is fun. 
---
There is absolutely rouge spec that is capable of producing enough tps to be on top on a boss fights
---
And if your hps get enough tps to beat a melee I’m almost amazed on how low tps they got.  
---
As heals is half threat of a dps spell 
---
And bosses needs to be x% over threat from ranged to switch to them.  
---
You are correct.  It was an aura that cow palys had for a single patch when tauren first became palys
---
The tanks can stance dance anyways.
---
I would bet a lot of money that dwarven priests are not gonna be as rare as they were in vanilla. People are aware now that it's the OP race for alliance, so a lot of people are gonna pick it. 
---
Moonkins aren't totally useless though. Considering the +3% crit buff for raids could've been worth it if Balance was a little stronger, sure, that's a legit complaint. I've seen plenty of good Moonkin PvP though, and it also seems the preferred spec for a lot of dungeon solo'ing, which is cool.
---
I'd it if a fully geared Moonkin was worth bringing to a raid like a geared Feral or a geared Shadow Priest, but *at least* there is that role for Ferals, unlike Ret Pallies.
---
Here's hoping for 1.13 in a couple years!
---
Lol right? I mean, realistically it won't even affect me as I'll be playing a warrior or rogue but more raid content would be soooo fucking cool, especially with got much stuff was left unfinished in the vanilla world (Kara, Hyjal, Uldum, etc)
---
Thanks for your thoughtful reply. Everything you've said makes sense, I think what's keeping me leaning still towards rogue is twofold: 1) nostalgia overload, it's kind of silly but just the idea of returning to the same character from before gives me that same feeling as when I'm anticipating catching up with an old friend. 2.) Not reinventing the wheel. I have loved playing healer in games since, for many of the reasons you've mentioned, absolutely, and it would make sense to carry that into WoW classic. But it's daunting to consider all the work I invested into understanding how to dps rogue, and starting from scratch with a brand new archetype... I almost feel like if I want to play healer I might as well consider all the many games I could do that in besides WoW... I'm sure there's a lot I will have to re-learn even as a rogue, but the idea of being ahead of the learning curve, right out of the gate, progressing with the content as it releases, isn't something I had the good fortune to experience before, and is definitely part of the allure of returning...
---
Part of me feels like it would be wise to hop back into the private servers right now, play a priest, see how it feels, give it a chance before the real thing drops... but then, I also don't want to walk into WoW Classic already feeling tired of WoW. Heh, I'm probably overthinking it. Appreciate your food for thought :)

---
I've played many pserver launches and I think sharding on launch is a fair alternative to fast respawns and reduced vision.
---
not quite 132 with only +270 but alas if the buffs stack instead of replacing them, then it's obviously way above any form of potential detection.
---
Aside from the usual panic sapper charges and the usual doodles. But that's moving a bit too far off topic.
---
anyway thanks for the database. If they have the correct values it'll be a nice read for later to dig in the old files
---
Dispell, levitate, PWS, blackout, fade, Mana burn &amp; MIND CONTROL. super tough to give up
---
Who gives a shit if they do if they are gonna fix a class they better do it for the one that needs it. Otherwise it’ll cause a bigger problem.
---
The obnoxious no changes people will bitch about anything even if the devs ideally buff a class with no repercussions 
---
I'm pretty sure it actually doesn't.  On pservers at least. 
---
Hey If you join the Discord and just copy paste your questions from herw then the Guild Leader Nymis will give you a long answer for all your questions.
---
Well, thats better than we usually get
---
Troll or UD mage?
---
My plan is roling mage for classic. I'll be lvling with a friend, he's taking orc, so, the best choice would be picking troll for not losing the time going from UD zone to durotar.
---
I'll be mainly doing pve but also want to do some pvp (wpvp, going for the mount, etc). As i've read, UD pasive is not that bad for pve, but trolls are suppose to be the best in that field?
---
So, just need a bit of help to decide :D
---
Taladril's testing is questionable.  Wearing full mitigation gear for fury spec ????
---
Which exact lines are you comparing? From this spreadsheet, with ultra threat gear, fury is just a bit behind prot in threat generation. And only if you don't dual wield, don't pop death wish or recklessness, dont use /sit. 
---
It also assumes you have Thunderfury. If you have a different weapon, you don't  get all that threat from the proc. So your threat will be more dependent on your attack power. 90% of tanks will be fine in impale spec with thunderfury. 
---
But the big issue with Taladril's analysis is his fury spec rotation is garbage. We don't need shield block on CD. We don't need to prio sunder over heroic strike.   This testing is not conclusive. In fact, if you consider how unfair he was to fury spec's rotation, it makes sense that fury will come out ahead when you see how close those numbers are. Or you know you could play the game and see for yourself. Don't just trust everything you read online.
---
"So without an on-demand enrage it's going to be even worse than that."
---
No, This testing tests for if /sit is used and if not. 
---
Basically, after a certain point in server. The ony buff will drop every cd. All you have to do is be online for the CD to pop. 
---
At worst, one guild member being online 2 hours early will be able to determine when the next buff can drop.  You might have to log on a bit early or post pone your raid a bit. Top level guilds don't mind. At best, everyone is on 2 hours early and it's easy to get buff.
---
Again, guilds got world buffs for all their Naxx attempts in original vanilla. This isn't the insurmountable problem you are making it out to be. 
---
Somehow I thought you were fishing using your mobile phone

I'll be picking the highest pop PvP server I can find on launch day, with my friends. Back in the day I played on Detheroc, and it was a terrible decision. My friends and I picked it at the time due to the fact that it was a Low Pop server, and we didn't want to ever have to wait in a queue. Bad decision. Always wished I was on Illidan.
---
what do all of those stand for
---
So, Dark Below confirmed?
---
Well i don't have exact number (thinking about it 2x might have been a little over-exaggerated) but it is at least 50% more. Our top dps that used to have to slow down on a lot of boss now don't even need salvation to go all out. Some of our off tanks are switching to fury dualwield because of that and get about the same result.
---
If the boss hit hard he can still put a shield and still do slightly more threat than what he used to with a prot build. Survivability wise, he only lose 6 sec on shield wall.
---
His threat is still lower than what i can do on my druid (except burst threat for the first few seconds he is more reliable on that) but he get pretty close. Have to use the gnome mace to really make a difference.
---
If my info is outdated then that's just better news for humans. Go team humans (stomp the gnomes :p) at least my port slaves will be humans either way ;)
---
&gt; Moonkins aren't totally useless though.
---
just 99%
---
That's wise, to go with your current interests and stay open to "re-creating your vanilla experience" on an alt. I'm still leaning towards revisiting my old friend, but I do really appreciate your input, and will spend more time considering it :)
---
Funny enough, listening to music while gaming is something I haven't done much since WoW. Nearly all the single player games I play I tend to have the sound on, listen to dialogue, etc. and for multiplayer games I listen to chat.
---
WoW raiding/leveling/dungeoning/questing was a time of many jamz and beats my son. Not that I didn't also listen to the in-game music, but it was like 60-40 music to in-game.
---
Everyone says attitude is more important than what you play and as someone who has officer experience from a legion guild I agree 100%. We would regularly bitch about people who under performed but we would keep them in the raid because they had an excellent attitude and weren’t a drag on the raid morale. If you’re good and a complete ass hole you’re out so quick you don’t even get a chance to blink. 
---
That was my experience. 
---
Ive never ever seen felcloth go for more than 3 lets say 5g sometimes
---
only on pservers with broken 10k pop
---
That's fair, I'm sure I won't hold a candle next to those who have been perfecting their craft ever since private servers have been a thing, in PvP... and probably in PvE as well...
---
Correctly spec'd a warlock will beat a rogue &amp; warrior in 1v1 with full consumes 9 times out of 10.
---
Only way a warrior can beat you is if he gets an insane mortal strike crit on his first hit. If you sac VW shield and resummon you'll kill the warrior without him using any abilities.
---
Spot the man from the UK. This'll be lost on the majority here.
---
I was in the NA closed beta...but I sure as hell wont be able to find screenshots from it! hah
---
You can trick more people into giving you things as fem nelf tho 
---
Yep, will be cool if they keep the pops down again. Naxx will actually feel like a real treat, as opposed to the Pserver scene, where it's all about who can down the current raid boss in under an hour after it's released.
---
Rogue's sweatin'
---
I was in the second to last heat of the open beta and I heard about the very end when they let infernals down everywhere and killed all the players.
---
I juuuuuust missed it.
---
Satan? Is that you?
---
Oh man, yeah I totally feel you. I haven’t really touched a rogue since those early days, and I know I would have a blast picking one back up again. Knowing everything I do now, and really going into it tryhard sweatband nerd style would be awesome. There was so much I didn’t know about the class that I would get to abuse the second time around. Problem for me though is I already have 1-2 IRL friends dead-set on playing the class so I wouldn’t want to step on their toes...maybe as an alt in the future.
---
As for the P servers, I understand. Burn out is real and you don’t want to do 1-60 as a priest only to do it again come summer time. I’ve steered away from them for the last few months and tried to occupy myself with other games as the hype builds. There are a few p servers where you can make an instant level 60 with gear vendors so you can atleast dabble around on the class to get a feel for it. Maybe do a bit of dueling or kill some mobs to see how the shoe fits
---
Everyone be like 'fear ward fear ward' must have much wow
---
and yet we've only got our first dwarf priest into the raid when we ate yet another guild before naxx opened up.
---
The only reason why you 'need' it are lazy warriors and pseudo tank druids - which you will stomp into a corner when naxx arrives anyway
---
BRD man - 19 bosses - the 5 man dream.
---
Paladin and Priest might have specs that let you heal and farm. Since you are not raiding you have some nice flexibility. I know Paladins can AoE farm pretty well since they are tanky and have cons aura. Priests can even manage with holy nova. You can just make a spec that will let you farm and heal 5 mans. Healing 5 mans isnt too demanding, especially if you have good blues. 
---
Paladins are amazing PvP healers. Super tanky and provide amazing support with abilities like blessing of freedom. 
---
Priests can go shadow with very little gear and melt people in PvP. 
---
rogues also have an item or two to increase stealth.
---
Why not play a Druid then?
---
Well, they are now in the second fear DR and you spent a coil, while they only spent a racial.
---
Huh, never knew that. TIL.
---
Oh I acknowledge it's not actually worth it. A combo of 4 Mages/Locks with +3% crit and a Moonkin is still probably less dmg than just getting another Mage, sure. It'd be sweet if it was a 10-min castable buff instead of an aura; THAT would probably make it worth bringing one meme spec. Well, I guess at that point it wouldn't be a meme anymore...
---
And weren't they immune to other forms of crowd control? It's pretty cool balancing upsides with downsides like that.
---
I wouldn't count on post-cata retail landscapes being more similar to vanilla than pservers to be honest. I don't know much about pservers, but I can tell you they changed a TON of terrain, especially at the edges of zones, for the cataclysm.  
---
It's the sort of thing you just have to bite the bullet to fix. Not sure what addons will be out in vanilla, but most likely some sort of bar addon (bartender??) and/or an aura addon. Both of these can be used to make clicking abilities with your mouse impossible. Play with that for a while before switching back and you'll find that you can't go back to being a clicker. 
---
I used to have macros that did the /cast in chat commands and I thought it looked so cool. 
---
Good catch, vanish applies SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH not SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH_LEVEL so you're right it doesn't stack.
---
However vanish is still a level scaling spell which these online web databases don't show completely.
---
BasePoints = 270 + Level * 5.00
---
In this case Vanish Rank 2 has a base level of 42 so at 60 the difference is 18 so it becomes 270 + 18 * 5
---
So effectively level 72 stealth before talents/items.
---
https://imgur.com/a/6F1UJcb
---
Sure, but if we're talking a 1v1, all a good warlock needs is time. They certainly aren't hurting for HP once you get Voidwalker shields and Drain Life into the mix.
---
I personally hope they do release TBC, and continue to move forward with the other expansions. 
---
A typical WoW expansions lasts for about 2 years'sh. We're approaching the 1 year mark of BFA, which is going to be around the time Classic WoW releases (Summer 2019). We might get WoW's newest Expansion in the summer of 2020, which will mark the 1 year anniversary of Classic WoW. 
---
Having new/old content release every year would personally keep me and a ton of friends sub'ed all year round. Currently, about 90% of my friends have quit, waiting for classic.

Still remember how UD were UD and wet themselves when priests or paladins rampaged through the lands. Ah - when UD rogues were running away from priests -  good times
---
As with any good raider, look up the fights ahead of time to learn whats needed. Or ask your raid leader whats expect of you so you can prepare. Most guilds/raidleads will be friendly as long as your honest with what you know/dont know and open to working on making yourself better.
---
Heck, now that I think of it, if you do it at launch there's a non-zero chance that you'll even have company for your journey. 
---
&gt;Moderators
---
No, it's easily spotted in dungeons too, because when there's only 3 DPS (or you are the sole tank/healer) your performance is quickly noticeable. But yeah, any place your shoddy performance can be lost in the crowd, you can get away with it.
---
Ppl around you still mostly will judging the spec.  
---
Let's say you have 10 premades/dungeons/raids you want to enter.  
---
If you pick "suboptimal" spec you will have doors open to 6-8 of them.  
---
"Optimal" - 8-10.
---
Your mastery and commitment are only modifiers for these numbers.
---
The choice is obviously yours, of cource, maybe you are not even interested in such activities or you are willing to struggle more for the sake of playing the spec you like.
---
I'd love to see a new game like classic, that takes a ton of time commitment and has mysterious random broken elements with massive advantages and disadvantages to each class. I dont see anything like that in the industry tho. I blame the zoomers
---
It'd have to be juuuust early/late enough to almost seem legit, but be left to question.
---
So like...... late may or late september. Then they release some kind of riddle that's supposed to help us figure out which it is. Then they don't dispel it/release any info until a month later.
---
They could even leak other fake info via social media, create a viral marketing campaign where we all foam at the mouth and try to crack the code.
---
Then, while no one is looking, they release the classic severs by adding them to the realm list under inconspicuous names. Its only by picking that server and creating a character that deep deep deep in the blades edge mountains there's a tunneling device, similar to the ones in blackrock mountain. 
---
This device leads you to the caverns of time where, upon  completing a series of quests you're awarded a remote with 11 charges, a 23 minute cooldown, and awards 2004 experience upon use. When you finally use all of the charges the game crashes and upon re-entering, all of your characters have been deleted and your game reverts to 1.13. 
---
Upon creating a character, Chromie awaits you to inform you that the last 15 years of time have been erased and the remote was created as a safeguard that a noble champion would use to undo the damage. 
---
Or, you know..... they could just troll us with another fake class that looks funny.
---
My bad indeed, this one needs an ounce of logic: reddit is no good place for such a thing. 
---
The class flavor fits NEs so well too. they just look so cool as priests.

Hi Thoryan,
---
Thanks so much for listening and please don’t worry or be shy about constructive criticism, you bring up some very valid points! If I could do it over I would definitely have taken this advice into account, it all came together very last second, as we recorded late at night about 20 mins after Mute first contacted me, so we all may have been a bit flustered haha. Thanks so much again.

---
I feel like you are selling hunters a little short. They are pretty hard to master and engineering helps them alot but they are quite powerful in PvP. Any class can get CC'ed, that's classic wow. 
---
They also have the least competition for gear after the tanks. Raids don't want a lot of them and their ranged weapons have no other class that wants them. 
---
Warlocks will have a lot of competition for rings, trinkets, and weapons. They will get their tier fairly easily though. Which is useful in PvP mostly. Speaking of PvP, with gear, they are scary.
---
I would just play what class you enjoy the most in PvE and PvP. Gear will come.
---
It's not just the color, though; the reason I'm specifically gunning for a young nightsaber from Shadowglen has absolutely nothing to do with mechanics and everything to do with my being a complete sap.
---
By way of explanation, my first character was a night elf hunter (female, naturally; I was a teenager at the time). Upon reaching level 10 I ran her back to Shadowglen and deliberately sought out a level 1 nightsaber because I liked the idea of her pet going from 1-60, same as her, and being her constant companion at every level along the way.
---
I never actually got that character to 60; I made some new friends and rerolled on a different server somewhere in the middle of '05 and she stalled out around 55ish. He's still there with her, though, which is what matters to my crazy brain that somehow managed to form a genuine emotional connection with a virtual collections of code and polygons.
---
Since Classic is going to be something of a stroll down memory lane for me anyway, I figure I may as well go all in and repeat that experience, even though I'll be primarily playing Horde this time.
---
I'll definitely keep that in mind for my other hunter who won't be taming a primary pet based on nostalgia, though. Thanks for the info. :)
---
Never a queue. The greatness of vanilla is that you actually had to go places yourself to do things, regardless if its just going to a city to queue
---
Can you even be a Nelf priest, could swear was implemented in wrath or cata
---
Yep it's so ridiculous. No one cared what race you were back then, I was a nelf priest and no one ever gave me grief about it. By the time people realized that dwarves were helpful on certain encounters most decent guilds had already cleared the content. People made fun of any guild that 'needed' a dwarf.
---
But if you play a nelf on pservers randos will tell you to kill yourself. 🤷‍♀️

---
Hmmmm, it's almost like different people have different opinions.
---
I really want to roll human for that spirit buff, because I'll be disc, but idk man, shadowmeld is just too useful on a PvP server... and of course Night Elves are just simply the coolest models by far.
---
Might I suggest a gaming keypad, such as the Tartarus V2? It makes it much easier to not lose your place on your keyboard, and the keys are easier to reach. In addition, you replace the space bar with 4 buttons (and two very close by), which is a FAR better use of your thumb that just one big dumb bar. It's like having two extra fingers!
---
At launch, think there might be one later.
---
Were extra action bars even added then?
---
I remember waiting an eternity for them to add that? Or am I just thinking about the far right action bars?
---
Vanish has two different effects. Vanish purge, which breaks target and makes you completely invisible for one second. The other is the vanish buff/aura, which increases subtetly by 270 (at rank 2) for 10 seconds. Quite a dramatic increase in stealth level in other words.

---
I can hear these words in his voice and I can't stop giggling at work.
---
female nelf casting animations are hands down the best in the game.
---
Will that make Fear Ward redundant on the bosses that need them? How many dwarf priests is too many?
---
Mining nodes aren't hard to spot most of the time, especially once you learn the spawns
---
Nah that picture has circulated enough that I've seen it plenty of times and I'm from the US.
---
nelf priest is a better raid healer than a nelf druid
---
Hmm that kind of sucks. I hope they release them earlier, it doesn’t make sense otherwise. 
---
Whichever item has more shadow damage is the better piece in 99% of situations.
---
I have a Razer Hex, but our mice share the same basic shape. with MMO mice, you pretty much need your pinkie pinching the mouse, rubbing against the mousepad to give your thumbs leverage. If you've always had a lazy mouse hand and just laid your hand across the top, I can see why you're having issues. You have to use your pinkie to hold the mouse in place and get leverage straight across from the side buttons. Start by gripping the mouse from the sides only with your pinkie and thumb being the only contact points, and figure out a natural position from there. 
---
I googled your mouse and I dont think you'll have trouble with it after you learn how to use it properly. The design is working as intended and I could absolutely play with what you've got for side button keybinds. 
---
Summer there is actually pretty nice around July 16th. 
---
&gt; really going into it tryhard sweatband nerd style 
---
Ok, for starters, I'm totally going to steal this phrasing it's perfect hehe :)
---
You're a good friend for conceding to your other friends :) Jumping into a lvl60 server with priest is actually a great idea! I actually am REALLY looking forward to the leveling process in Classic, and want to milk it for all it's worth, before endgame becomes the whole game... so the idea of playing vanilla without spoiling that experience is genius, thank you!
---
Although, someone in this thread has pointed out that the skill level of vanilla is not the same now as it once was before... and even though they were referring to PvP, it has given me pause to think about PvE as well...I'm foolish if I think I'll be able to pick it back up like riding a bike and perform at the same level as before... I don't know, lots to consider, maybe I should tool around on a lvl60 priest and rogue and take it from there... (and warrior... damn...)
---
Ahh that’s too bad. I know the game emphasizes community, but I like the idea of jumping in solo when I can and working my way toward something great. 
---
The real reason to roll NE: flips and the bounce ;).
---
Lol, NE racials aren't as bad as people make them out to be for priest. Starshards in particular is an underrated leveling spell. But I will say they really are inferior to dwarf. Desperate prayer and stoneform are amazing, especially in pvp. You don't realize how obnoxious blind, crippling poison, and viper sting are until you play a horde priest. 
---
Fear ward is obviously great, and I don't think I need to repeat the reasons why. I will add that it's castable on the entire raid and during combat, meaning more dwarves equals more fear immunity during a fight. Also amazingly good for pvp. An alliance druid carrying a flag can be saved by a well timed fear ward. Flash bombs are their nemesis. 
---
The Tier 0 and Tier 0.5 sets have a lot of curb appeal and are worth it for that reason alone.
---
Can we get a release date for the release date please?
---
Dwarfs are ugly and Humans are boring. I don't mind playing a Human Pally but there's no way I can have two human characters. Going Night Elf all the way. They look so much better and everything NE is cooler. Besides, people way overestimate how much the racials matter.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=6898
---
Damage received = more rage and when you take no damage well then thar doesn't happen.
---
I would not have leveled as a resto druid from launch.  Ouch that was rough.
---
They're not bad, but I would argue that human female casting animations actually fit priests the best
---
I feel the same struggle. Orc is clearly the superior rogue race hands down but, I wanna be undead way more. Prolly gonna go undead though. Orc rogue just looks was too crappy. So Glad I don't play Allie. At least my options arent short as hell. I am 6'3 in real life. I can't even wrap my mind around tiny people stuff. It just makes me uncomfortable.
---
Personally, I would say that the one with the “flavor” that speaks to you would be better.
---
Ignore distance for starting zones and ignore racial (if you’re not min/maxing).  Simply put, what looks better to you and makes you think, “yeah, that’s ME.  That’s MY character.”
---
1) Warrior rotation is fun and so is tanking. They are one of the more engaging classes in that respect.
---
2) The only hard thing to find will be a tank slot in raids. Those are usually filled immediately. If you start looking now you can probably find one.
---
I think leveling a mage first makes sense. Being a DPS warrior in a raid is very expensive. You need BOE pieces that can cost a ton. The bottom line is how much time you have to play to be honest. Being a warrior is a bigger time investment than a mage.
---
Yeah I'm not disagreeing with you 
---
Can you heal late/max level 5mans in feral spec at all? It would certainly cut down on costs of constantly respeccing. 
---
Also, what turns me off a little from druid is not having an out of combat resurrect, but I'm not completely sure how big of a downside that is outside of raids.  
---
You know the legendary Buddhist will be returning to classic? We will make this land our kingdom once again
---
I don't know why op listed all the most obvious and intuitive parts of beginning a hunter, and left out this, one of the most important and unintuitive aspects lol
---
I've actually been eyeing both classes. Priests seem pretty neat, actually. But for both of them I'm wondering if there's a dps/hybrid spec that will let me heal 5man content without having to respec every time I want to go out to gather mats and kill mobs on my own. Also on both, but probably the paladin especially, I'm worried about having to maintain two sets of gear. 
---
This guy has it.
---
I'll add. A lot of PvE is boring as pure classes.
---
Keep hemo applied. Keep slice and dice up. Hit for solid white numbers. 
---
PvP is more complicated because every matchup you can set up to your strengths or remove theirs. Warlock is very similar. Only thing is we are built to kill a target so there's a lot of waiting for 2-5 minutes between 1v1 when they happen. 
---
Loved my warlock and rogue in vanilla. Hated raid lock. Rogue at least kept me always trying instead of snoozing. PvP loved both.
---
So many people will roll mages. Being a warlock or rogue should be a good time. Probably some other good options but I only played the two classes competitively in classic.
---
That's so fucked up it's not even funny...
---
lol tho
---
The difference here is... 1 Agility = 1 Attack power and then some cross over in crit and dodge.   For casters in general.. Int = mana and crit.. and spell power is a stat.  we would only have this setup if int = spell power and mana / crit.
---
So really just flat spell power will be your best stat for dealing the most damage. 
---
Good riddance, Gamergate Apologist chud
---
How is the 21/0/30 or 20/0/31 build for Paladins?
---
I really want to play paladin for end game content but I'm constantly hearing how ret isn't good for raids and at most will bring 1. I don't mind healing but I'd hate to have to respec everytime I want to pvp or do solo content as ret.
---
It’s nice to run into people like this that won’t steam roll over you for being a noob. We all start somewhere and little interactions like this make the game great.
---
You can never remember who taught you certain things but it really is great to think about 
---
Priest with herbalism and tailoring. Tailoring for bags, especially at start.
---
Pvp, you will get stuck at some point because of lack of gear (since you don't raid nor will have time for the epic pvp set). But it's easy to find a group and it's noob friendly healing.
---
This is something I was awful at and lost money mostly.  I thought it was better to sell the item faster than making a decent profit.  You know, one in the hand is better than two in the bush they say.  Twice vendor price on this blue I found seems reasonable.  Man was I a n00b.
---
Also...I know of no guild (short of the spriest being the GM or a very high ranking officer) that would prio an spriest on gear over any decent warlock.
---
We had a lock in our guild recently hit 60 and the same week be number like 4 in DPS in MC and probably number 8 in BWL, despite competing against mages and other warlocks who were a shitton more geared than he. A good spec, knowledge of the class, and some basic consumes can go a long way with Warlock. I wouldn't let anything like that dissuade you from the class.
---
I don’t think 11-20 ever existed. I vaguely remember it being 21-30 as the lowest. I only have this memory Bc I had a 30 Tauren Sham with corpsemaker and topped the charts. I’m pretty sure I didn’t use purge back then also lol. I have a vivid image in my head of me one shotting a fem human mage on the ramp in wsg. I remember I wasn’t hooked on wow at first and played here and there, then the bgs came out and I turned into a junkie. 
---
This is the real advantage.
---
I want no changes, so I don't want 10-15k as that is not close to being like Classic. 
---
That zf mace looks like totem. 
---
Dopest.
---
Jesus man dude is dead. Learn some social graces. Crap isn't that serious.
---
Not sure what's the correlation between being disc and spirit if the talent that gives you +heal for spirit is in the last tiers of holy spec.
---
Like I said, a couple of rogues claimed that they could tank, and their threat was quite small. I would wait as long as I could, so they could generate as much threat as possible. Then cast the smallest heal I could to generate as little threat as possible. And the instant I cast that single heal, the mob would peel off the rogues and attack me. Thing I found most humorous about the situation is the rogues complained about me being a "shit healer" and the mage standing next to me (doing absolutely nothing) replied "what do you expect? The instant she casts a single spell, she gets aggro." (I was playing a female draenei priest). But honestly, rogues are melee (obviously) and I'm not surprised at their having a lot of threat mitigation built in.
---
Strength of earth and grace of air add more damage than Kings
---
\&gt; Fear Ward is now only available to Dwarf Females.
---
Fucking brutal
---
Sounds disrespectful.
---
In theory, all pets have the same same health/dps/movement speed/base resistances (0). The only difference is the pet's attack speed. You have pets with 1.0 attack speed like Broken Tooth, which are very useful in PVP as faster attacks mean more pushback against casters.
---
The only other notable thing to keep in mind is to not tame pets that have a mana bar. Those have lesser stats and will have 30% less stats/damage than a non-caster pet of the same level.
---
TL;DR
---
* Only difference is attack speed
---
* Don't make caster beasts your pets, they'll keep their worse stats
---
This made  me laugh more than it should've.
---
Does a 31/20/0 elemental devastation spec have any viability in PVE or PVP? 
---
The idea would be to burn mana on high rank lighting bolts and shocks and fish for ED procs, then switch out caster weapons and shields to a 2h and auto attack with +9% crit and flurry to for a while to Regen Mana. 
---
The issue I see with this is itemization might be impossible. 
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zE0hqoxVbdV

sounds like it was one of the later-added quests, at level 50. would have been late vanilla. a lot of classes had level 50 quests added that took them to ST.

But I enjoy all of them :( lol

---
Night Elf Priest can Shadowmeld at the Great Lift and MC Horde off the cliffs. This is far better than Fear Ward will ever be.
---
I'm going in blind with the help of my 15yr old memories.

As some famous halfling once said...

"I'm going on an adventure!!" with tears in my eyes and the largest grin imaginable I'll dive headfirst in to some of the best memories I've ever had.
---
It was last year when I realised that the Hardware Store is not a machinima song, but a Weird Als. I always thought it has been created for the WoW video.
---
&gt; I find it annoying that if I have rank 6 bite, I need 20 skill points for rank 7, but I also paid for the rank 6 bite (let's say 15p), meaning I pay 35 points total for rank 7.
---
Not how it works, unless you're playing on a really poorly scripted private server. If you have Rank 6 Bite (15 CP cost) and want to learn Rank 7 Bite (20 CP cost), you'll only spend 5 CP, which is the difference between the two ranks.
---
The only issue is that the cost displayed on the beast training tab doesn't change regardless of what rank you have.
---
The virgin meta slave dwarf vs the chad meta breaker night elf 
---
Rank 14 weapons are all the same. But that's a lot of pvp...
---
Hellfire will no longer kill you in retail (if it’s even still in the game). Besides being a handy way to avoid repair fees, it was an incredibly thematic consequence of the spell considering the whole class theme of Warlocks revolved around harnessing hostile power.
---
For duo leveling with my sister: Priest/Warrior or Shaman/Warrior?
---
Exactly what im doing
---
Yeah, but besides armor I swear it gave attack power of sorts. Which could have made sense if you were staffing people in the face. But wands were superior. Someone told me of a secret strength Priest leveling method once. Never tried it though..
---
Well if it’s in tbc + there is a few threat reduction things incl.  in the builds.  
---
The times I have heard.  It’s my fault when I heal and a dps caught aggro....   
---
My standard reply (had it macroed) was: 
---
I decide to live or die, with the good of the fight in mind. I will sacrifice everyone to make it.  You are expendable.  
---
Explain: 
---
You can sacrifice a tank if you make the fight the last % when range dps is spread out.  You can sacrifice your self.  If you think it’s the best.  No one is critical there is no I in Group. 
---
Haha oh yeah I remember that now! Pretty sure I accidentally killed myself I dungeons a couple of times as a new player!
---
The most important thing when taming a new pet (aside from completing the 2nd quest to learn feeding/res/etc.): 
---
The pet's happiness isn't displayed in the pet tab, it's displayed next to the default UI's pet frame. The "happiness" icon in the pet tab is always green no matter what and only serves to know your pet's diet when you mouseover it.

It's not racials, but racial spells, specifically a feature of the priest class. Check out how "awesome" 2 spells that were made for the nightelf and think again, maybe, every time you lose a fight because of fear or not being able to DP yourself you would blame yourself for not rolling dwarf. There is a very limited usage for starshards (mainly the same as arcane missiles in vanilla-tbc, when your target is going to go out of LoS and with starshards you would still be able to continue damaging him) and the second spell is not even worth talking about.
---
Meditation means your spirit contributes to in-combat mana regen, good for long fights and PvP. If you have more mana regen, you can use higher rank spells more often.
---
It is going to extend past launch. We will see Sharding/Phasing be a norm in Classic WoW.

2 Years? What's the rush?

It took me well over a year to hit 70 during TBC.

I still remember taking a few months off when I started college.

It's like Resident Evil 1. One of my favorite games of all time. I don't care if I haven't played in 6 years, I wanna plop that disc in my PSX and have a Jill Sandwich. Same for Vanilla. I want it there when I wanna play. Now. Or when I have grand kids.

Sorry, didn’t mean to sound like I disagreed 😅 I was just adding on 😋

Apparently, u/totzz has found a way around our "no politics" rule... clever girl.

I had both a human and gnome rogue. I'll make a gnome or dwarf rogue this time unless forced Horde. 
---
The number of times I literally hid in a bush as gnome waiting for stealth to be available is reason enough. Weapons look great on them. 
---
Escape Artist: Escape the effects of any immobilization or movement speed reduction effect. Good warriors were always a loss for me unless I fled or dragged the fight for 5+ minutes. As a gnome it was much easier. People don't get a lot of PvP practice against uncommon race and class combos so you wait for the inevitable charge hamstring.

Considering that both holy and shadow specs could grab this talent I don't think that this can be called as "disc".

Yeah, I think it was only in the initial release before racial abilities even existed.  I only heard that second hand so idk if it's true.

could be, I just picked lvl 35 because that is the usual lvl for artisan, didn't specifically check engineering 
---
*rolls on hand of justice*
---
I guess you have a point about the simple rotations.. A little bit sad. 
---
I've never thought about the /trade for food and water which might be more annoying that having to farm shards. Also I like having a pet since it does make leveling a lot easier, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. I'll probably go good ol' Warlock. 
---
You will have lots of time from 1-60 to practice with your new spells and key bindings, just slowly learn as you level and it will kind of fall into place easier. Not like your gonna be overwhelmed with a hot key or two to start. 
---
Yeah it did give us that. For when we're OOM and have to melee because we're level 25 and still haven't gotten a wand drop and too poor to buy one.
---
It isn't necessary on private servers either, its just another way to play play. Also you keep saying hit % is off (implying its massivly off even) and that just not true, at least across the board. There is plenty of data on hit % from vanilla forums and videos.
---
But it is far when you’re leveling
---
No doubt about that
---
lol you clearly never played Nost the first week.
---
You are very true about the mounts, but I remember the Dreadsteed quest taking ages, so maybe it would take around the same time, playing as a mage, to farm the gold required for the 100 % mount. 
---
Food for thought, thank you.  
---
U might be mixing felcloth with moon cloth on ah prices. 
---
Staged release.
---
Do you want a number?
---
Theres no gap if you do your grinding as you do you questing, rather than doing them separately.
---
Mooncloth is on a 4 day cooldown, and requires 2 Felcloth to make. Mooncloth is around 80-100g on AH, and Felcloth 12-16g
---
The other main factor, the PvP set is actually designed for feral/resto combo, which is far better for PvP than a caster only T0.5 set. 
---
Priest/Warrior is a little more straightforward than Sham/Warr imo. You also won't be competing for gear with each other. Sham/Warr is a bit more of a challenge, but both have good utility and will be good farming duos endgame. Whatever you and she prefer.
---
It is not a wand, it's just my melee autoattack with my staff. I thought I had to have it on my action bar in order to be able to attack. /facepalm

You can be ret and still heal really well as a paladin. Especially as anything less than hardcore min-max I don't think respeccing is necessary. You'll absolutely have to have a good healing gear set though. Do not try to heal in ret gear unless it is understood by your guild you'll be raiding as ret and throwing support heals.
---
First of all try to esdf instead wsad, now try to justify how often used and how important spells must bind blinded, also think about shift, alt, ctrl modifiers, for me shift is best mod, alt is less, ctrl is worst. 
---
For example i have caps for any emergency oh shit button(bubble, fd, ice block etc, w for any stand still but very often used spell: flash of light, frostbolts, r pretty same as w but least used: holy light, scorch/fire ball, a for frost nova, q for fire blast, c for any strong instant cc, or spell interrupt: silence, pummel, scatter shot, intimidate etc, for number keys i mostly use only 3 for casting cc: sheep, fear, and 4 top trinket slot, 1 and 2 usually binded for rarely using shit like seal of justice, first rank of fire ball, course of reckless etc. 
---
Also try to hide all spells that dont have cds. 
---
But in other hand you need to always keep your left hand on keyboard. 
---
Thank you so much for this! I work in a quiet office, and loudly cracked up several times reading this.
---
Damn I thought you cracked the code :(
---
I'm using it as an opportunity to do what I always fancied, which is heal.
---
The reason Inner Fire gave Attack Power is because Disc Priests were originally conceived of as a melee priest. 
---
I'm surprised that people still speculate on dates other than this one, it's basically the only thing from Blizzard that gives even a small glimmer of what it could be.
---
What items would you buy / what would your tactic be ? 
---
I thank you and others like you for all my epic mounts ;)
---
Usually Blizz april fools are quite obvious and just plain silly. I guess they don't want to really fool anyone.
---
While I’m in the camp of people who think temporary starter zone only sharding is ok, perhaps they could do a less obvious population coping method like dynamic respawns.  
---
I’ll just create characters in ALL realms at launch then wait 1-2 months till just messing around before I get serious 
---
maybe but dreadsteed looks cool
---
Not even THAT hung
---
That show might be what started me listening to podcasts.  
---
In vanilla shadowmelt cant be used in combat
---
Not sure why people shit talk shadowmeld, it's a nice racial that allows you to drink-eat in stealth and being able to camp spots/flag on WSG/defend AB base with rogues/druids/NEhunters. But I think the most value out of this racial comes with a hunter. Not only that your cat pet can have stealth too, FD allows you to have to make a bootleg stationary vanish out of shadowmeld because it puts you out of combat.
---
15 years later still learning shit.
---
Playing a shadow priest and randoms whispering you asking for healing. It's like "ok, but you're not gonna like it."
---
Melderon of Defcamp and Melderon has full length videos of each dungeon with commentary. Watch one of those before you run s Dungeon, maybe on your lunch break. That way you have your head straight during the run. 
---
Technically the breaking point where more Dwarf priests has no benefit is when all the melee can get a FW (not including the tanks assuming they aren't too lazy to stance dance). It's really not a huge difference, but every melee that doesn't have to stop DPS during fear is technically a DPS increase. 
---
dynamic respawns, even fucking private servers had it
---
You are out of combat once your target dies. In world pvp it can be the difference between getting away or getting mauled by reinforcements.
---
I'd like to add that I love most of the useless spells we have. I don't think I've ever needed Detect Elementals, but it just added to the fantasy of being a badass warlock who is a master of elementals and demons.
---
Except for those useless conjured stones. This time, I won't even learn them when I had 10,000 gold in the bank.
---
Preach it brotha!
---
I think I personally would like the battlemaster system because lower levels won't be ganked constantly by higher levels at the entrance.  Kind of a trade off between queuing anywhere and walking there.
---
I don't think dynamic respawns would fully fix the problem, and I'm almost certain they're doing that anyway.
---
Same. I've always loved my warlock, even after certain nerfs or buffs... I ALWAYS come back to my warlock. 
---
It's what I'll be rolling day 1 when classic launches and I cant wait to do the class quests again, honestly its why I'm holding out for classic, because getting that lvl 60 Dreadsteed is a JOURNEY and feels extremely rewarding in the end. 
---
All good :)
---
1v1 is part of the set of 1vx
---
Just go once and sit
---
Ya, someone who plays a shit spec and plays it poorly should be welcome in every raid group! How dare someone have consideration for 39 other people.
---
How would they determine who gets to play first? Seems like a good way to piss people off.
---
On a pvp server shadowmeld has aced my ass INNUMERABLE times that fear ward wouldn’t have 
---
Min makers can eat my tall curvy stealthed ass.
---
200+ players in a starter zone killing mobs that spawn every 10 seconds? That sounds "reasonable" to you?
---
How far does this go? More herbs, more skins, more ore for only certain zones? All zones? Unlimited consumables and AH market blown out?
---
They’re gonna change that, just watch. 
---
This
---
Server queues.  It worked in 2004.  I don't see why it won't work today.
---
It fits the Classic style perfectly.  Delayed gratification.
---
I think i saw Byron Bernstein do that in arena once when he didn't have the right keybinds. He types really fast.
---
night elf priest was my main in vanilla so good.  I was one of the best pvp priests on the server and starshards and shadowmeld were invaluable. I'm now regrettably a human for arenas but fuck retail 
---
I'm with you. It's so annoying to read "should of" ... once I can shrug of, but twice?!
---
I should probably keep this to myself but fuck it.
---
Deadwind Pass buzzards.  As a prot you can go around in a large circle killing the buzzards.  The respawn is setup as such once you finish the circle the first buzzard should be respawning.  These birds drop great vend material in feathers and strange eggs.
---
Azshara thorium grinding.  In the north east side there is a tower with 2 thorium nodes that spawn right next to each other. Park there and fish for eels and winter squid.  Gather the nodes when they pop.
---
Ungoro:  farm raptors for vends/gather crystals/soils for resale’s.   Use your soils for marrowgrain and resale.  (Made my mount just from marrowgrain resale)
---
Dm:e:  2-3 man.  Bring an enchanter and you be the only miner.  Their are 2 guaranteed nodes at end.
---
If RP-PvP isn’t available on launch I’m just rolling a normal PvP server and never looking back. Screw rerolling. 
---
more like the combination of mark of the wild and mage armor kicking in ;)
---
*holy shield 2
---
I oddly look forward to having soul shards and summon requests (without anyone lined up to assist) again. 
---
\*moaning\*
---
Which is why I said it. There isn't a viable or reasonable alternative.
---
Dynamic spawning is pure poison and wrecks the economy. How many zones would be affected by it? It is highly exploitable.
---
i use wasdqr and tab with my left hand and set the skills to left down up and right for my right hand. I change bars with 1/2/3/4 so i can have 16 skills to use easily. also i get to keep my hands in the same places as when i played maplestory
---
The only time that a female nelf (and priest especially) looked awesome and attractive to me was back when that nelf priest pvp video in barrens showed up, where the guy (I mean obviously it's a guy player, right?) was mind-controlling lowbie hordies off the elevator down into the 1k needles. All supported by a "Smack my Bitch Up" by the Prodigy (RIP). Pretty cool old-school vid.
---
Well, I guess the double backflip jump is also nice. And that the voice actress for the fem nelf sounds like a hot stripper.
---
it's literally 1/4th of the damage these dudes do on the private servers.  
---
The prot warrior sacrifices alot of dps compared to ordinary fury warriors:  
---
being gimped by dodge/parry from standing infront of the mob,   
---
having offtank pieces to not get oneshot,   
---
wasting talent points in prot to get shield block (missing impale).  
---
the tradeoff becomes more balanced, and the previously obvious choice to go fury for threat is not obvious anymore.
---
In BGs Troll clearly has the edge over UD, especially if were talking premade vs premade. The consistency of Hex is just too good to pass on compared to the powerful but situational utility of WotF.
---
And it becomes even more apparent if you spec Blackout for Shadow Guard proccs. There are *many* good Priest specs for PvP. If you strive for maximum flexibility/utility and mobility you can do something like this for example:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGs0bZfVzbZVMgzcd
---
This spec give you the three big PvP talents: Improved Manaburn, Holy Nova, Silence. It lacks the efficiency of a more specialized build since it doesn't reach Mental Agility &amp; Strength or Spiritual Guidance &amp; Healing or full Shadow Weaving &amp; Darkness, but it makes very good tradeoffs for a mix of survivability, offense and protection.
---
Oh my god the moment i mount that magnificent monster is amazing every time
---
awesome! So I could heal as a full ret build? As long as I have a healing gear set right? 
---
But I’d rather make use of my time and level as I wait for bugs wouldn’t you think that’s a lot more efficient?
---
No sorry, SWC NA.  :)
---
To me the dumbest spell was Create Firestone, giving a warlock the chance to deal 80-121 damage on each *melee* attack.
---
All you need to do is unequip your off-hand and equip that useless thing.
---
I don't even know what they were thinking when inventing that. Later it was buffed to also increase spell damage by a tiny amount, but even then, only fire damage.
---
YES
---
And even some of the spells like curse of weakness/recklessness had very niche uses, which made you feel like you had a dark little trick for every situation
---
Each time I whisper the members and be like “does this guy seem bossy to you?” And they always agree. 
---
The vanilla community has no room for these assholes. And there’s definitely a difference between giving well-meaning but direct suggestions, and barking orders like a dick. 
---
Great, except it's past the point of opinion. This won't be in classic. Really shouldn't need to explain that one. 
---
You would never know someone is popular as a bystander because 15 realms are shoved together in 19634 shards so you'll literally never run into them randomly and would have to work hard to find them and their groupies
---
One cancer to cure another, sharding completely avoids the streamer annoyance.
---
Technically, it's taped.
---
I've legit never seen anyone go that spec.  I mean, I'm sure it has been done before but nothing that had any longstanding or widespread efficacy. 
---
The most common PvP specs are 
---
30/0/21 (Elemental Spec + Nature's Swiftness)
---
31/0/20 (Pure Elemental Spec + synergy talents in resto)
---
0/30/21 (Enhancement 2H + Nature's Swiftness)
---
20/31/0 (Stormstrike+Clearcasting/Eye of the Storm)
---
The last spec is an all out aggressive spec that really only works at very high end game gear/enchants.
---
Can't listen to that shit without tearing up.
---
Varies greatly by realm. Safe bet though are BoE blues (especially those that require the upper end of a level bracket) for pvp twinks and low-mid level crafting materials for when people start leveling alts or for the AQ event. The materials for greater fire/nature/shadow/frost protection potions will also sell well when bosses that deal those damage types are released 
---
&gt; Can you heal late/max level 5mans in feral spec at all? It would certainly cut down on costs of constantly respeccing.
---
Can, but depends on if the tank is overgears content. You lose faster HT, mana efficency, and your oh-shit button.
---
&gt; Also, what turns me off a little from druid is not having an out of combat resurrect, 
---
Just don't let people die ;) 
---
https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com has some private servers. but no data is from the start.
---
I think krhonos 3 is the latest classic where data is  missing the first 6 months or so.
---
if you find something else please let me know
---
It can absolutely be too many, you need paladin healers as well.
---
A lot of people are going to roll a character, get to 20 and realize it's not so much fun  as a solo warrior or paladin.
---
Then, they'll roll a hunter.
---
That's literally what I did in retail. Level a pally to 42, then hunter to 60, then back to the pally.
---
Ya, can’t decide Undead Warrior or Warlock for main. Probably will go Warrior in the end 
---
Yeop.
---
I wouldn't be too sure of that. It would alienate the hardcore playerbase, but the casuals and the tourists won't care. And Blizz could very easily start catering to them, if the higher ups tell them to make Classic more profitable. Sure, the Classic Dev team is doing well at the moment in regards to community faith...but Blizzard as a company? They have over a decade of bad faith to try and get over.
---
Better to not have sharding at all so that the precedent is not there, rather than having to trust Blizzard not to fuck things up.
---
Completely wrecked the concept of the game. People crying for no changes ... yet ask for mobs to spawn and profession collection to be 5 times faster and makes consumables for raiding a complete easy mode venture which trivializes all content in game. Those people even pvp with full consumable buff stacking because of how easy materials are to get. Gold farming is also HEAVILY exploited by it.
---
Im so close to roll one in classic...
---
That trinket doesn’t sound very good lol. I’ll take the soul harvester 
---
lol
---
Wow does have  [https://theunderminejournal.com/](https://theunderminejournal.com/)  BUT it depends if UMJ will be able to access the same type of data using the API. 
---
I am more than confident someone will create a site, or UMJ will add the ability. The way we used to do it was uploading our Auctioneer data to the site, so it was not perfect. Now they have full API access to the going prices.
---
If TSM (Trade Skill Master) gets ported for Classic then this will be in place. . And MAN I hope we get TSM for Classic. Mostly for the nice crafting and mailing system integration. 
---
Curse of Recklessness should be used on every boss encounter to increase all the warrior / rogue DPS I'm pretty sure.
---
FW is almost always prioritized on tanks so they don't need to stance dance.
---
**Amplify magic** and **dampen magic**.  They are buffs.  One makes you take less healing, the other makes you take more magic damage.
---
**Curse of Recklesness** makes enemies hit stronger.
---
A lot of Paladin **Judgments** don't have damage baked in.  There aren't many abilities in modern WoW that are JUST for utility.
---
**No auto-dismount/auto-cancel-form.**  If you can't do it on your mount, it doesn't automatically dismount you.  Oh, and you can't even talk to NPCs in bear form.  Even druids.
---
**Hunter deadzone.**  Also that hunters don't automatically auto-shot on right-click.
---
**Downranking** simply doesn't exist past WotLK, but in Vanilla was a huge part of healing.  The five-second rule is also something that might be new to him (the idea that batching your spells improves things).
---
**There is no AoE damage cap.**  If an ability does 100 damage to 1 mob, and 1000 to 10 mobs, it will do 10,000 to 100 mobs.  Instead of doing 1000 to 100 mobs and only doing 10 damage per mob.
---
Also behind the flight master at the horde camp in Felwood.  
---
Shadowmeld back there, wait for someone to land, MC and toss them off the cliff into Darkshore.  
---
Username checks out
---
Nerds united in this thread
---
Oh I’m prepared for this. My bro and I are duo leveling one toon (him a lock and me a Pally) and will have another solo toon. My solo toon will be a feral Druid. 
---
Horde players would like to have a talk with you.
---
Since the coward u/snowb0und_ deleted his comment, I'm putting it here just so people can see what he said.
---
&gt;Good riddance, Gamergate Apologist chud
---
And in reply: You have a GROSS misunderstanding of the nature of his involvement in the gamergate situation. He was a massive force in advocating for truth and transparency in the relationship between the gaming industry and the consumer. You have no idea how important it was too have that voice on your side, and you should feel shame for saying such awful things about someone who cared so much about protecting what we all love.
---
I feel ya.. gonna play troll Enhancement Shaman
---
he said wow isn't a slow grind...lol
---
That works fine when the server population is spread out already. On a 1st day launch, a noob zone becomes instantly overpopulated by a factor of 10 or more. To preserve a functional population over 2-3 of the early zones, the queue would have people waiting for hours or even tens of hours.
---
Going into a cave felt like a solo dungeon crawl. Was awesome
---
Question because I forget: if you're out in the world and a party member queues you into a BG at the battlemaster, when you exit the BG are you dropped back at that point in the world or at the battlemaster?
---
Still have this toon?
---
Unless they cycle again to build up the hype.  I can see Vanilla -&gt; TBC -&gt; Wrath -&gt; Reset.  Give players a 4 year (ish) break before giving them Vanilla again.
---
*laughs in combat rogue*
---
Which i wish they had gone with instead of gimping paladins to fill that role for vanilla. The paladin from beta and TBC onwards was so different. Screw you, Tigole and Furor
---
I highly recommend a Razer Naga Hex v2 for the MMO genre. Super easy to use and has 7 thumb buttons plus the DPI buttons that can be rebound.
---
Well for raids its between that and curse of elements/shadows, depending on your comp.
---
What i meant was during the leveling process when your fighting humanoids in a densely packed zone and you dont want them to run and pull the other group.
---
Well it seems like a good way to ensure the more casual or "just curious" players quit after one night rather than two weeks. I agree delayed gratification is/was a part of vanilla's appeal, but getting to log into the game shouldn't be considered "gratification" in itself.
---
I would say it's not worth $200 extra, especially because the specs are the same. The GTX 1050 is a low power gpu and I wouldn't worry about the laptop overheating. $550 for the Ideapad 330 is a great deal, just make sure you buy an SSD separately as it doesn't come with one.
---
only for starting zones you fucking retard lmao
---
Jeydax perhaps?
---
But humans are taller than orcs...
---
Good thing there are not that many cave layouts then, makes planning the route easier :P
---
I love caves too, though, practically lived in the wetlands spider cave with many chars just grinding away and looting the chest at the end!
---
You should always use Recklessness, Elements, and Shadow for EVERY raid encounter.
---
The epic battles while people waited for the AV queue tho... Probably some of my fondest world pvp memories.
---
Still insanely good for PvP
---
Also, Servers near the top or very bottom of the list are more likely to be popular on launch.
---
Cornering the market and charging outrageous prices is exactly what happened on the private servers. Recipes worth 1g at the vendor were constantly 50g on the AH. Now I know pservers are not a good representation of actual vanilla, but this is my main concern with it. And sure they made good money from this, but feels unethical in my personal opinion.
---
Pay a mage to teleport you to Stormwind.
---
I laughed so loud in the middle of a lane at Costco.
---
What's holding you back? 
---
Yep
---
I loved MMOs prior to WoW, but within 5 minutes of playing WoW back in November 2004, I knew the genre as I knew it was changed forever (for the better)  
---
They took so many flaws of the current MMO formula and challenged the wisdom behind them and were correctly at nearly every single pass.  There wasn't a single gaming friend I had that didn't get their mind blown by World of Warcraft.
---
The only alternative that makes sense to me is to create multiple sub-servers of a single server:
---
RealmName1
---
RealmName2
---
RealmName3
---
... and so on.
---
Those servers would share a single character and guild name database which means they can be merged at will as populations come down in the weeks following launch. And if populations don't come down as much as expected these sub-servers can easily be turned into full separate servers, just rename them (not really necessary but Blizz probably doesn't want to end up with a bunch of RealmName# servers) and fracture the name database.
---
It is effectively sharding but with fixed shards.
---
nope, NE priests have been available since day 1.
---
inner fire gave AP because inner fire in wc3 gave attack damage 
---
I've noticed that the adamant "you need to do this" crowd tend to have not played the original game and/or were too young to experience the content.
---
There's literally a video from back in the day for 40 priests doing Onyxia for christs sake, and yet there are people here and on the forums will scream about there being an optimal raid setup that you must stick to no matter what.
---
I will be aiming for a lower population server and hoping it ends up being a mid pop server. I will be doing this by selecting a PvP server that is somewhere in the middle of the list and has a non-cool / non-well-known name.
---
I don't understand the problem with some fine tuning, truly.  All my friends and family should be able to play the classes they relate to and enjoy.  Wow has always been adjusted as the needs require since vanilla. They are called patches.  Balance should be a normal idea, a percentage here for damage, a percentage here for Mana efficacy, gameplay fundamentally unchanged though.
---
More people playing what they love will definitely contribute to the success of classic.
---
If I didn't wanna play so badly, I'd wait...but unfortunately I'll likely do the same. 
---
Oh I'll be conducting impromptu discussions with horde as often as I can come classic's launch.
---
&gt; And that the voice actress for the fem nelf sounds like a hot stripper.
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Oh gawd I hope so!
---
install any mouse gestures addon for Chrome/Firefox/whatever you use, refresh is: hold RMB, move up, move down, release
---
Thank me later
---
And of course lets not forget lumber mill in AB
---
I started with a Warrior. Brought him almost to max level. Then made a Rogue and capped him. Then I went back and capped Warrior and made him my main. 
---
I pretty much always played melee and I feel like this time I want to go Ranged. I’m leaning towards Hunter and Mage equally. Not sure which one to go! 
---
Warlock could have been a choice as well although they have garbage mobility and I’m thinking about having to fight a bunch of Undead players which would be a pain in the ass.
---
still nobody gonna kick you from the raid cuz you are a rdudu
---
2 dawns edge with agy enchants is way better stat wise than anything a hunter can get from MC. For a guild to give a bonereavers edge to a hunter over a pvp ranking warrior is just flat out retarded.
---
What you want to look for are ones where the buttons are all slightly different from each other, whether in size or angle. That way you can tell by feel which button is which. The position of your thumb (and how you have to change to hit each button) also helps train your muscle memory. I used to do a mix of clicking and key binds (1-4 keys, everything else click) and now with a mouse I can comfortably do 1-12 with just my right thumb.
---
I bet they change it though. The RP-PvP server polls better than regular RP servers. I think the community has been very vocal and we only need 1 server. Blizzard pls. 
---
*M'stripper.*
---
y u can
---
The Kingdom of Ernor!
---
It definitely does not show a "wrong" picture, it shows a different one. And I completely disagree that most picked within a faction is at all important, let alone "correct". Restricting classes to Alliance or Horde is akin to restricting them to a race. Who cares what most picked Human class is? You do not encounter only Humans, but all the other races. The same way you do not encounter only your own faction, but both.
---
Anyway, I never really labelled any of the representations as right or wrong, and this discussion on importance is only provoked by your inexplicable statements. Unless we agree on "importance", all discussions will digress to throwing around opinions. The idea was to have the full picture, people should draw conclusions based on what information they find appealing.
---
Im not super tech savvy but is the I5 ok to game with  is the I7 not worth upgrading to?
---
Yeah... Am I just retarded? The trinket sounds basically worthless. You are already going to farm a billion soul shards a week if you raid. How is it even conceivable that not having to farm a couple more is better than the staff? 
---
I thought about this but I’m not sure there will be a static server list like there was for vanilla, where it was alphabetical IIRC. I think it would make more sense to randomize the list for everyone specifically to avoid the ones at the top and bottom from filling up immediately. 
---
Git gud 
---
Soul shards tho. 
---
They had it because that's the best they could do to deal with their insane pop numbers. 
---
And people abused that shit to level even faster than you normally could.
---
Pro strats... Unfortunately I work on an Air Force base and can't install anything useful lol.
---
Might be soon to schedule vacation 
---
You do realize enrage isn't gonna go from 100 % up time to like 10 % right? They'll still proc enrage naturally pretty often doing the same shit pushing threat beyond what being prot will do for them.  
---
Look I get it you probably don't like that the way vanilla was designed and whats min max are two different things. But those people are going to continue to do what they've always done.
---
Haha you're going to make 3 hunters?
---
Kargoz Paladin Leveling Guide on Youtube
---
Male dwarf here. My /seduce game is fire.
---
Has servers been confirmed? 
---
I never raided in vanilla. Hit max in tbc where it wasnt a big problem. 
---
That being said, trapping your enemies soul inside a trinket really sticks to the theme.
---
“Discussions”
---
I've only seen it used to prevent fearing of a specific mob. All raids I've done curse of elements or curse of shadows is used to increase non-melee dps.
---
This doesn't really solve the problem for me. Yes, it fixes the extremely high populations at launch in starting zones and cities, but would make later zones even less populous (at least until the realms are merged). I just see (temporary) sharding as a better solution. 
---
I could see it for Harvester maybe? AoE was usefull and warriors kinda sucked at it.
---
I know right!
---
You will have to wait several patches before they add in DM just so you know.
---
If you rush to 60 you will be waiting months for that dreadsteed 
---
You can
---
On paper, the Warlock always looked interesting to me. But in reality, I have always found the class to be the most underperforming, tedious  to play and not as engaging. Especially before Wotlk. Guess it's just not my cup of tea.
---
I'm fairly certain humans have more because that's how it is in DND? The devs were pretty influenced by DND, as most played it themselves (from what I hear from the devs themselves). I mean, a bunch of the abilities in the game are straight ripped from DND (take mage abilities for example). At character creation in DND, Humans get extra ability points and the option to choose a feat. So although I do agree it is a tad bit unbalanced in the context of Wow with 2 opposing factions, it is consistent with DND which would make sense. In my experience High-Fantasy games (such as WoW or DND) tend to treat Humans as the balanced, "Jack of all Trades" race: nothing overpowered, just a lot of little useful things.
---
Yes, they get a 5th racial, *but* you'll notice they are the *only* race without a "castable" spell as a racial (such as WarStomp, Shadowmeld, Stoneform, etc), and they are the only Alliance race without some sort of racial resistance buff (improved nature resist, etc.). (for the record I play Horde so I'm not defending what I play 😅)
---
1. I want a very specific answer from them on what zones and for how long Sharding is going to take place.
---
2. I want a realm list so that we can start coordinating where we want to play
---
3. I also want them to scale back AV to the original release or provide the ability to queue up for either version.
---
For budget gaming an I5 is just fine 
---
Oh, how many fell to my trickery at the lumber mill.  
---
Yes, they could be priest in classic. Nelfs could not be mages till cata I believe. Lore wise this was because it was arcane magic that caused the world to get noticed by the burning legion and then  Azshara and her Highborne mages tried to summon the legion through the well. Which when the other elves found out about this said "fuck that shit" and stopped Azshara but sundered the well and the world, so Nelfs stayed away from magic mostly.
---
Have you tried casting Mind Control on him?
---
First bwl clear. Top dps. Lol so full of shit
---
Pm'd you! 
---
My guild fell apart because the guild leader was a prot paladin. We were a top guild until AQ and he just couldnt hold up and refused to let a real tank tank.       Prot pallies arent going to cut it sadly.   Ret pallies are pretty awful too.  They can come, but pretty much anyone else would be better, sadly.

Ah. TBC brings back memories. A couple of months before WotLK was released, I decided to roll and level a character of every class in parallel. By that I mean that at no time while leveling the characters would any character be more than 1 level away from any of the other characters (with the exception of the bank alt). I also decided that this group of characters would have every race/gender combination. Let's see if I remember 'em all.
---
Draenei female priest
---
Draenei male shaman
---
Human female warrior
---
Human male paladin
---
Dwarf female hunter
---
Dwarf male rogue
---
Gnome female warlock
---
Gnome male mage
---
Night Elf female druid
---
Night Elf male rogue (bank alt)
---
And when WotLF was release, the Night Elf bank alt was deleted and a Death Knight took his place.
---
Got 'em all to the high 60s before WotLK was released and since the guild I was in needed a Raid healer, the priest was rapidly leveled to 80, leaving the other 9 behind. I was rather surprised at what classes I enjoyed playing compared to classes I didn't enjoy. Loved Paladin, hated Warrior. Loved Warlock, hated Mage. Loved Druid, hated Rogue. 
---
The OP is about 1v1.
---
Which the spriest is king of 1v1
---
smart guy.
---
I really hope that Blizzard would block all API calls for first 12-18 months. What is the point of playing Classic if you are just going to add back in all the conveniences in form of add ons?
---
I will be playing as blind as I can. Obviously I remember stuff, but I won't be using wowhead or quest helpers like a bitch.
---
Not for a lvl 19 twink
---
My fondest memory is actually of Vanilla Warlocks is from my wife. We both played in one room at the time and she was more into PvP than I was. I was doing my own thing and suddenly I start hearing her giggling. Turn around and she’s got some poor bastard feared while she’s nuking/doting the shit out of them. She had entirely too much fun with her lock. :)
---
Guns
---
The biggest fallacy you have here though is acting like Ony head is the only world buff. 
---
Guilds can still easily get all the other buffs, even if Ony head is completely off the table.
---
How would threat issues be worse when the tank doesn't have world buffs? More damage means more threat, but what about things like sunder? World buffs don't give sunder more threat. 
---
Well, tanks get a % increase to their threat from both defensive stance and the Defiance talent.
---
1 more dmg to the dps is 1 more threat for them. 1 more dmg to the tank is 1.45 more threat for them. 
---
So, as you increase tank and dps dmg with world buffs, tanks come out ahead.
---
Honestly, if you don't know basic stuff about tanking and threat, you should probably just not participate in these discussions. 
---
Well I can see situations where being able to generate a shard would be handy but personally with how cool the staff looks and how it is pre-raid bis it’s a no brainer to take it. 
---
The i5-8300H is a great chip, and will not be your limiting factor while gaming with a 1050.
---
Brah you can downrank to rank 1 so it does hardly any damage.  Or use rain of fire if you're that worried 
---
Saaame. I'm not much into priests but a year or two from now I'm going to roll one just for those sweet starshards.
---
I’d still go dwarf just for the looks
---
Pretty sure the Tauren Chieftain hero in Warcraft 3 says “I’ve got an axe to grind!” and also used a massive axe. He existed long before World of Warcraft.
---
Best quest in the game - hands down. Change my mind.
---
Going to make me compare 3rd edition racials when I get home and can compare them. I say 3rd because 3.5 came out in 2003 but I know I have a 3rd PHB. 
---

That's what it used to be, now it's just full of people spamming MAGA

Works without the crits as well, usually popped ZHC or BWL shaman trinket for 1v2's -- not always though. 
---
Even without crits I'm taking out 3k hp at the very least with LB+CL+Shock combo with near BiS gear. 
---
He was probably comparing it to EverQuest II and Lineage II, which both came out in 2004 in North America.
---
I'm torn between Warlock and Mage, I played Mage my first go round in Vanilla so it would be different but Warlock only seems to rock 2 cookie cutter specs and spam shadow bolt, that doesnt seem fun.        
---
           
---
Plus the shards you gota farm and keep, I think I'll stick to my boring old Mage or go real crazy a level a Hunter! but then I start to think about how their DPS doesnt scale too well for Naxx... Then I think about actually getting into Naxx and I laugh so hard a pee a little. I dunno maybe Mage.
---
"oh no he broke my fear, guess I'll just void sac, death coil, quick summon, dot him up, fear again, and void sac again if necessary"
---
I for one love Barrens chat.  It's very active, and a zany way to share some thoughts while doing low level PVE.  
---
Low level PVE is pretty boring, so plenty of time to shoot the breeze.  Sometimes there is relatively real discussion that goes on, but then when it heats up and several people might be talking it scrolls real quick.  It's a lot of fun and most importantly it is what YOU make of it, so if you want fun Barrens chat contribute to it in a positive way. 
---
And funny enough the argument can be made that human is actually stronger than dwarf. If your tanks just stance dance, which they should be doing anyways, then FW won’t be used as much. Therefore the increased spirit on human would have more value. I get fear ward has its place but I really don’t get why people think dwarf is the end all be all. And this is coming from a healer main obsessed with min maxing. 
---
And now I will dream of Night Elf Priests, joining Molten Core Raids with Dancing Queen blaring through the Discord.
---
Thank you for that Nightmare.
---
The issue will be the alliance/horde imbalance. I hope there’s some sort of filter that prevents people from making another horde character if there’s already a huge disparity between the two. 
---
I played Alliance on Hakkar and it made for instant pvp queues but the horde Pvpers would have to wait 40 minutes for a game. 
---
In TBC I made a character on a fresh pvp server (Auchindoun) that was 80% horde(4:1 ratio) and world pvp was a nightmare. Luckily I rolled rogue, but everyone else suffered and a lot of alliance quit due to the imbalance, which made things even worse resulting in a 90% horde server. 
---
I am of two minds on this subject:
---
**On one hand, there is more to the game than your numbers.**  In a 5-man, having someone who can pick up aggro if the tank dies/gets slept/goes AFK, or having someone who can CC or dispel, is often more valuable than raw damage output.  In solo play and PvP, a lot of things become more important than raw numbers.  So a lot of these "useless" specializations are actually very useful somewhere, even if they're not useful in T3 40-man raids.
---
**However**, if you are in a raid team, then you've got 19 or 39 other people that want you to be the best you can possibly be.  In this scenario, your extra abilities are not as necessary, because you have players dedicated to being the off-tank.  Your job becomes much more focused, and a specialization that better suits that focus will better suit the raid.
---
If I am leading a raid, I want to see that players are taking steps to improve their performance, especially if we've hit a wall.  Those steps can be:
---
* Change your spec to be more optimal (this can be a complete rebuild or it can be shuffling points around)
---
* Hunt down better gear from other sources (crafting, dungeons, BoEs, etc)
---
* Enchant your gear
---
* Do research on your class to make sure you're gearing and building in the right direction (watch videos, read guides, ask questions, do spreadsheets)
---
* Do dungeon runs to hone your skills
---
* Research the fights and make sure you know them inside and out
---
There's a lot of things you can do.  Changing your spec is only one of them, but it can also be the easiest one to do, and is a good show of faith to the raid that you're willing to commit to success.
---
With that said, if you are in a sub-optimal spec and the raid is progressing satisfactorily, then you should be fine to continue.  But if your raid hits a wall, then you should do everything you can to improve performance.
---
The problem that everybody is realizing how awesome warlocks are and how their in danger of being insanely overpopulated.
---
I would force everyone to reroll their priests as dwarfs, dwarf master race!
---
I prefer Dwarf Priests not for the Fear Ward, but for the Stoneskin. Priests are the only healers who can't remove Poisons and it feels so good to be able to shrug off the dreaded Viper Sting from a hunter and the Crippling Poison from a rogue, along with other annoying poison debuffs while leveling. I see that as much more of a PvP advantage than Shadowmeld.
---
But hey just role what you want. I have over 100 days played on my retail priest from 2006 and he was a Troll. Not sure if Troll was ever optimal but damn do I love Trolls.
---
I keep playing with the idea that I'll roll dwarf priest, but I just don't think I can do that.  Nelf is what I'm used to, and the content isn't so hard as to where one less fear ward will make that much difference.  
---
While I'm not sure how Starshards made it off the developers table originally, Nelf is what I'm comfortable with and healing is what I do.  Night Elf Priest it is.  
---
Sloth or Edwin?
---
Yes, he still exists! Currently level 85, I think. Transmogged into a bunch of TBC raid items.
---
I never reached level 60 before TBC came out, the first raid I ever did was Karazhan, playing on this toon. Those days raiding Kara and Magtheridon were the most rewarding and social gaming experiences of my adolescence. Rishilla reached level 80 during WOTLK and raided through T7, but that guild fell apart. I continued playing WOTLK sporadically, and ended up stopping playing WoW a little before Cata was released due to the time conflict of going to university for Bachelors degree in Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology.
---
I am now in the 3rd year of a PhD program studying Evolution, Ecology, &amp; Behavior, with a PhD minor in Genetics. But I'll be damned if I let grad school get in the way of playing Classic this summer!!!
---
*Laughs in Darnassian*
---
Loot Trading is back
---
I wouldn't /delete or vendor it if it was the only quest reward. But that was mostly my point, it seems terrible to take over the other two options.
---
There should be Battlemasters. You only had to walk to the physical entrance of the Battlegrounds for about 4 weeks. Battlemasters in major cities were added very quickly (I believe in Patch 1.6) right after the Battleground were added in Patch 1.5.
---
And t's soooo good to be able to AFK whenever and wherever you want to. Just for that I find it disorienting to play different races.
---
So by 1.11, I imagine they were already in the trenches working on Burning Crusade. I find this interesting, because there are a few elements of these patch notes that are far less 'evil' than the rest, that eventually became part of the game. Things like conflicting faction reputation (Aldor vs Scryer in TBC, Frenzyheart vs Oracles in WOTLK), removing HP-missing scaling from troll Berserking, and the like.       
---
         
---
I wonder if they ever used April Fool's patch notes to test the waters on some of the less clear design choices they were thinking of making. If a bunch of the community react to a given bullet point with a strongly negative view, they can brush it off as having always been a joke. On the other hand, if people generally say, "Actually, this one doesn't really seem all that bad" they can note it and circle back to it later.
---
At it's most basic level: it's anywhere in the game where player population is too large for a single, regional chat channel to handle. Human nature takes over and the vocal minority take over.
---
Metzen: "Hope you feel at the heart of it". 
---
So strange to hear them talk about the game pre-launch; before they realised just how successful WoW would be.
---
Great video, thanks for posting it, 15 years in and I'd never seen it. 
---
Steeper climbs make for stronger calves.
---
&gt;but I think that might be slower.
---
Why would that matter? Are you getting paid for reaching max level as fast as possible?
---
People are putting so much effort into optimising levelling for really no return. Unless you are part of the very top hardcore guilds you won't be missing anything by taking your time. In fact things will just be better when all the asshats have already cleared the content and you don't have to play with them.
---
It goes without saying they'll have some sort improved respawn system in. I guess you could just shard everyone so that there's max 15 people in any one zone so they could quest with vanilla respawns but that sounds pretty dumb. If you want to facilitate intended gameplay and you want to limit sharding obviously you'll need an improved respawning system.
---
Not really. I just follow the swarm of Horde players on one PvE server, since we are always in the minority.
---
That's why we need Realm names. We need to organize this shit.
---
See you at rank 14.
---
I think it's a bad mouse. I've tested it for 2 weeks, and I would've kept it if was shaped better, it didn't have a rubber coating, and the thumbgrid buttons weren't so mushy and wobbly.
---
The reason why I find the mouse shaped bad is because:
---
* The top of the palm rest is arched to high. 
---
* The bottom of the palm rest is too narrowly slanted, so that if you keep your palm in a fixed position but use your fingers to pull the mouse toward you (like you would do to move the cursor downward), pushing he mouse into your palm, the bottom part of your palm gets caught underneath the mouse in between it and the desktop. Like your skin is getting pinched. Hope you get what I'm trying to describe. It was a little thing, but it was very annoying over time.
---
* It was too long. I don't have the biggest hands in the world, so your situation might be different, but my fingers were too far back of the left &amp; right primary buttons, so that it costed me more force to actuate.
---
The reason why the rubbercoating is bad:
---
* Manufacturers add rubbercoatings to handheld products for either a premium feel or to give it more grip. Corsair probably did the former, as you really don't need more grip for a mouse than what you get with matte plastic. But what's so premium about it when your product gets disgusting very quickly, as all rubbercoatings universally do if touched with bare hands. For me after a week of usage the Scimitar was covered in grease stains (I always washed my hands when I had handled food before I'd touch the mouse again by the way), and as rubber is porous and therefore difficult to clean, it takes a lot of wiping and even then there's still some visible staining left. Skin grease stains will over time start to smell as well. On top of that rubbercoatings always degrade over time, because they dry up. The original Naga had a rubber coating, and it started to disintegrate into tiny rubber particles, leaving wear marks behind on the left &amp; right primary buttons, and exposing the plastic housing underneath where the rubbercoating used to be. The same will happen to the Scimitar.
---
The reason why thumbgrid buttons were not as good as Naga Chroma's:
---
* As said, they were mushy and wobbly. I can understand why they were, because their travel distance is greater than that of the Naga Chroma's. And seeing as there is very little space to stabilize the buttons, this is the result. You may like the greater travel distance, but personally I prefer my buttons to be stable and feel more snappy for a faster response. 
---
The Naga Chroma on the other hand is shaped nearly perfectly when compared to the original Naga, G600 and Scimitar. It should work for small and big hands, and anything in between.  It has a nice matte plastic surface. And out of all the mice I mentioned I prefer its thumbgrid buttons (from worst to best: original Naga, Scimitar, G600, Naga Chroma). They've got a distinct clicky sound (G600 and Scimitar sounded a bit too quiet), they're smooth (better for gliding your thumb across them, though they are angled differently so you can still distinguish them), and they're not too big so that they're better to access without moving your back and forth too much (the front rows 1-2-3 and 4-5-6 can be easily access with the tip of your thumb, and rows 7-8-9 and 10-11-12 with the ball joint of your thumb).
---
The downsides though of the Naga Chroma are that:
---
* Razer Synapse isn't cross platform (though there are two third party Linux ports available), requires cloud to save &amp; restore settings (though there is a third party Windows port, but it isn't seeded anymore on TPB, and no idea if it is free of malware as the source code hasn't been released), Synapse can't run on two user accounts on the same Windows install at the same time (i.e. if user 1 logs in first, then Synapse is booted; if user 2 logs in after user 1 while user 1 is still signed in, then Synapse won't boot for user 2 since it still runs on user 1's account), and Synapse is relatively speaking slow to load (it's one of the last software in my startup folder that is fully launched).
---
* The LEDs on my Naga Chroma and that of my brother's Naga Chroma Epic's are fked up. In the beginning they could display white (or rather: it's never been a pure white but more closer to cyan), but over time the scroll wheel's LED couldn't display cyan anymore but turned to amber. Fast forward to now (I think I've got the mouse since 2015 or so), the the scroll wheel, logo and thumbgrid LEDs can't display white/cyan nor many other colours that I set in Synapse to display. From what I've read Razer has to do a hardware replacement, but my mouse isn't under warranty anymore. Razer is known to built devices that are not made to last. So it wouldn't surprise me if this is done deliberately to encourage customers to buy a new mouse (I don't, because I don't want to spend more on a mouse that otherwise works perfectly fine, not to mention that there isn't any other thumbgrid mouse OEM I can run to).
---
* Over time there can occur a 'double-click' issue. It is literally that. Apparently when debris builds up on the contacts of the primary buttons, your regular single-clicks turn into unintended double-clicks. I had this on my original Naga, my current Naga Chroma, and my brother's Naga Chroma Epic. If it happens you *can* apparently solve it by blowing in between the primary buttons and the plastic housing, and I guess that air moves the debris, which I did, and it does seem to work for now, but if not then you have to pry it upon and clean with an alcohol swap. I've never had this issue on my Logitech G5 that I've used since TBC and is still in use by my parents. So either this is a design fault, or again planned obsolescence by Razer.
---
* The Nage Chroma (non-Epic) is in Synapse 3 listed as a "legacy device". I don't know what that exactly means. It does work fine with Synapse 3, but it might mean that it might eventually be dropped from support, and/or that Razer is planning a refresh of the current Naga Chroma. But who knows. Just thought it was worth mentioning.
---
Also don't bother with the Epic version of the Naga Chroma. That thing is absolutely garbage. Wireless cuts out frequently, it is a heavy mouse due to the battery, due to its weight it pushes down harder on a soft mousepad, causing accelerated wear on the teflon feet, as well as causing the plastic stick on the bottom to bubble and severely increase drag overtime, and if that's not all then there's the fact that Razer doesn't support it in Synapse 3, which means that once Synapse 3 is out of beta and Synapse 2 won't be supported anymore, you have to hope that Synapse 2 will continue to work for as long as you use the mouse.
---
With all that said, imo, the Naga Chroma is the best option of all thumbgrid mice that are out there. Or I should rather say: least worst? If there is ever a mouse that is shaped like the Naga Chroma, has got the same surface texture, has got the same thumbgrid button feel and design, but its LEDs are longer lasting, primary buttons don't suffer from debris buildup, doesn't requires software that requires an internet connection, or (preferable) the entire configuration can be stored on the mouse so that on Linux/Windows/MacOS it doesn't require external software to function, I would switch to that mouse in a heartbeat.
---
As long as the person is working toward an acceptable performance level, I don't care.  But if a person has limitations and refuses to address them, they are holding the raid back.
---
Eh, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Class population is pretty even all around. Unless you're a warrior or druid then it's pretty much all the same. 
---
nah now its basically thedonald
---
Rank 1 is still decent damage. Also, are you just trying to stun or are you trying to kill. 
---
Because server population was spread out when WoW launched in 2004?
---
Your wife sounds awesome and maniacal. Hold onto that one. 
---
I'm also just assuming he hadn't fully completed leveling to 60, since the review was made the same month of release. Probably didn't realize the grind to come.
---
All software needs beta tests and stress tests. They may not be need to be public, but not testing your software is fucking stupid. Don't try to be condescending and dismissive because we the public don't know the inner workings of a specific project. It's a reality that software needs to be tested. We do know it needs to not be buggy and we know it needs to be stable, and the way to ensure those two things is by testing the product in circumstances similar to launch.
---
Smite's mighty hammer (or Rock Pounder from Redridge quest) 
---
-&gt; Verigan's fist around level 25 or earlier if you find some friends -&gt; 
---
RFK level 30 Corpsemaker -&gt; 
---
Vaniquisher's Sword 1h around level 35-36 if you're healing SM, quest reward, -&gt;
---
Might of Mograine level 39 I think (or 40) 2h.  That'll get you well into 40s at which point you can keep doing dungeons like Uldaman / ZF for their 2h weaps.  Not really necessary though IMO- if you get to around level 50 with Might of Mog (totally doable) then you can do Mara for the 2h mace which can get you to 60, and do BRD or ST for 1h caster type weapons too for your healing set. 
---
Might of Mograine -&gt; Princess Theradres' scepter IMO.  But I'm not a huge fan of Ulda or ZF so that's just me!  Princess scepter can take you to 60 no prob
---
Yeah, I don't blame ya for thinking I'm full of shit :) I always went into every fresh raid encounter having watched the videos and done my homework. I was blown away when it happened, the moment has stuck with me through the years. I'm sure I was a little lucky and got in some dps after the other rogues had dropped, or something. I earned massive amounts of respect from my new guild in that moment. I obviously can't prove anything to ya so I'll just accept your doubt as the highest form of a compliment, so thanks!
---
Well, the offensive one is certainly one of the best cast animations, but i really dislike the defensive one.
---
True, and all the videos of gameplay is from (very) low levels.
---
I doubt that unless its a full stack, I think the most I ever had during Vanilla was 30-40 gold, fuck me i'm going to pay that much for middle mats. 
---
A lvl 19 think could be leveling up their professions or gathering mats to make money or just have some fun killing some people in the world as they wait for bgs
---
So even a twink would have a use for queuing within a battle master
---
I wouldn't have wasted my time trying out "Firestone Warlock"
---
It's fun to level with but ultimately gets pretty difficult to always be online at the same times
---
My brother played a Nelf Priest in vanilla. His guild cleared half of Naxx. I wouldn't worry about racials too much.
---
not even a browser addon? sux 2 b u bruh
---
Everything in Vanilla was gratifying.  Logging in.  Getting a 6 slot bag.  Finally getting that stupid item from these stupid mobs that I've been grinding for 2 stupid hours.
---
Queues make the game seem more exclusive, show the other fans there are people waiting to play it (so it must be good).  It's just like opening night for a movie when the line is out the door.
---
Soul shards aren't a big deal in pve. You'll probably run out of them during 4h raid, but once you start running low you just save them for soulstones. The most annoying thing about them I would say is for pvp, because its annoying to try and get souls of players during pvp and its annoying to interrupt doing pvp by going to farm souls. You can bank souls too so if you know that you are gonna be doing pvp for whole day you can fill your bank with them and inventory and then do some pvp and refill and then when you are fully out take a break and go farm bank &amp; inventory full again. For pve it can get annoying if you have lots of gear saved (old sets, pve &amp; pvp gear, resistance gears, shit ton of consumables, trinkets, etc) and still need to bring as much souls shards as possible.
---
Depends on the situation, but I'd guess hoping for a stun most times rather than doing it for damage 
---
Where did I say I was going to have only one of each of those?
---
Add a wow token /s
---
I've never thought about a FD/Shadowmeld macro to essentially make your player disappear. Does this work? Also, does sending your pet into combat cancel your shadowmeld? If not, you could use this macro during wPvP to disappear and let your pet keep doing damage. 
---
mmh reminds me of the 40 hunters rag zerg :D
---
You go to wherever they queued from. So either a battlemaster or the entrance to the BG
---
I was considering a NE because I'm a mom and Shadowmeld is as good as it gets to pausing the game haha
---
Like most of the posts on this reddit
---
My first character was Night Elf Priest. I am going with Night Elf Druid this time, I just need to figure out the name (I always use high fantasy themed names, so I can immerse even more), and profs :)
---
Reminds me of when I used to play Achaea, the whole game was text based so if you hadn't written any scripts group fights would just be 100 line/sec spam of "X sips from an oaken flask. X begins holding their breath. X gains an aura of rebounding" and so on. And once you had written scripts it was hardly better because it would just be lines upon lines of "TARGETING @ left leg torso DWHIRL.   REBOUNDING UP. TARGETING @body SHATTER"
---
Man i had some good times with that game. Took way too much time and i had to dump it eventually, shoutout to my Mhaldor homies though
---
Sit on the toilet before you try to fart just in case....OH SHARDING...not sharting...nm.
---
Female dwarf here, my twerk game on point 
---
Not even. Pretty sure browser addons are actually the least safe installs
---
1. Can be tested internally
---
2. AQ isn't even released for many months after release.
---
3. See #2.
---
4. See #2.
---
5. Easily tested internally.
---
Have patience dude.
---
Lol no. Data mining is just extracting things from the DB. You can still obfuscate the contents of the DB in a number of ways. If someone wanted to hide a quest from data miners, they could. Data miners might detect that something is being hidden from them, but they wouldn't be able to necessarily extract info about the quest.
---
I want to recreate my original fire mage from vanilla, but I'm concerned about having to respecc for Molten Core and the rotation being boring compared to Legion (haven't played BFA). 
---
Do Locks have more interesting rotations/are they viable in endgame?
---
Night Elf Mohawk.
---
Yeah you could always be a night elf priest.
---
I expect 1.12 items on stats at launch. But items not added to loot tables until 1.10 aren't available in phase 1.
---
Along with click to move: win
---
Just remember the first rule of a character in WoW. You're gonna have to look at its ass for 60 levels. Make it an ass worth looking at.
---
When it comes to server choice there are 2 things to take into consideration.
---
1. Server type (PVP/PVE/RP)
---
2. Population, This includes horde/alliance balance
---
I already decided that I will be on a PVP server. I also decided that I want to be on a high pop server with a close to 50/50 balance.
---
I am sure that once the server names are announced there was be quite a bit of coordination on this subreddit regarding where people are going to be joining.
---
You missed a step. Cast spells by spelling them out in the chat box using eyetracking on a virtual keyboard.
---
1.7
---
Illidan was originally a mage 
---
Spot! Use right paw!
---
I could be wrong, but Undermine Journal wasn't around in Vanilla, or at least it was not well known. If classic WoW uses a modern API system, then it "should" be able to access the AH for each server.
---
Your probably thinking about how impatient and terrible people are to tanks who don't do dungeons at lightning speed on retail aren't you? It wasn't like that at all in vanilla, and hopefully classic will be closer to that feeling. 
---
Don't get me wrong people might get frustrated if you take twice as long to do a dungeon and get lost a dozen times. That's not really likely to happen though. Most dungeons are pretty strait forward pathing wise, and there isn't a whole lot of skipping trash. 
---
There's a few exceptions, but everyone knows how confusing a dungeon like sunken temple or BFD can be the first few times and if anyone knows the way they'll be willing to help out. If they get upset that you don't know the way and they don't either... Put them on ignore :).

Camaraderie&gt;Raiding&gt;PVE&gt;PvP
---
I played vanilla religiously and was almost full t2 when BC launched. I intend on raiding as much as possible with it being my main focus. 
---
I want a semi-serious guild thats main goal is guild progression. As this is my main goal. I will be a super active player and expect the clan to be super active as well. 
---
Comment or PM if this sounds like your guild.
---
Not much, and why would they? This is the perfect use for sharding.
---
&gt;I work on an Air Force base
---
While you're at it, could you please check with the flight masters and tell them to fix their goddamn flight paths? Last time I checked they were all over the place!
---
Why don't you just run to the Orc starting zone?  Do you really think that waiting 5 minutes is going to make that much of a difference to your leveling?
---
I was Horde player for release too, but my brother and I thought playing Alliance in Beta is much better since you won't spoil any of the Horde areas or quests. 
---
Normally I'd be with you on giving players the option. For example, if Blizzard raises the maximum server cap (which seems likely), they should still leave some servers with the lower caps for the purists. Neither one really affects the other.
---
That's not true with having a frozen 1.12 balance server and also having an incremental rebalancing server. There's already a distorting effect on class ratio by having a frozen 1.12 server - people are more aware now of what is good and what is meta and allowed to come to raids, and there's also little hope to rely on Blizzard changing the balance to change the meta. So we should expect to see on a frozen 1.12 server (as we do in private servers) a significantly higher amount of rogues/warrior/mages, and fewer people trying to make it as a non healer hybrid. 
---
But now imagine we threw in an incremental rebalancing server. What do you think the effect would be? We would see those interested in playing non-healing hybrids (and other off meta specs) to all roll on that server (and hell, we would probably expect a greater ratio of healing hybrids as well, just from people who were planning to heal on them but want the flexibility). But we should expect fewer rogues/warriors/mages, as they would prefer to stay on their frozen balance server. As such, we'd have two communities with unblizzlike (and probably unhealthy) class ratios. And this class ratio would probably be even worse than the already bad class ratio you have when you only have a frozen 1.12 server. It probably shouldn't come as a surprise (considering that Vanilla was NOT a frozen state of balance, and there was incremental rebalancing happening all the time) but the only way to actually get a blizzlike class ratio would be to only have one server, which does incremental rebalancing.
---
Only gotcha with a Warlock in Vanilla is the rather limited number of debuf slots the Bosses have. So warlocks are rather limited in raids because of this silly limit.
---
I hear they're putting Alexa in the next xpac! 
---
Barrens chat is a means to find, at last, where the wif of Mankrek rests. That is the sole purpose of Barrens chet.
---
TIL that 60/2 = 44
---
Is there a shit ton of druids usually?
---
I forget what class I rolled my first time playing. But when I saw a lock and his little imp pet next to him in Deathknell... Yeah, I immediately logged out and rolled a lock. I want a friggin demon to fight along side me too!
---
Don’t downvote - use this as a PSA
---
Yes but there won't be any Bind On Account items like heirlooms and stuff.
---
Its amazing. The bond betweem a warlock and his voidwalker is deep.
---
Ask why does the dude from FF6 have a cannon on his arm like that Metroid guy.
---
Just remember the basic principle: "I act annoying, so people get annoyed" isn't exactly psychological science.
---
BC sl/sl underperforming?? *excuse me*?
---
&gt;they believe they influence Blizzard to make decisions on their own game
---
People are influencing. See the blue posts. And is that so bad? Shouldn't Blizz listen to the players (to some extent)?
---
&gt;they ruin the game with flooding popular gold grinding and xp efficient areas by telling everyone the secrets we already knew
---
How are they ruining it by telling everyone if *everyone already knows*?
---
&gt;[I] dont want to end up on some fanboi server where you cant step in Org/Ironforge without seeing a pack of lowbies surrounding some streamer
---
I don't think streamers are going to be the nuisance some claim they will be. And what *can* Blizz going to do to help? Ban streaming?
---
&gt;All this while they spend mommy and daddys money on donations to keep their electric bill.
---
What is this sentence?
---
I am bookmarking this post for... future *research* 
---
That's private server players for you.
---
What other class can you think of that's capable at level 40 of killing level 41 and level 42 elite dragons ... naked. No gear, no rings, no trinkets. NOTHING. Just you, your minion, and the elite 2 levels above you that you kill. I know a warlock can do that. While leveling my warlocks, I would frequently practice killing those dragons at the southern end of Lethlore Ravine.
---
He knows that. His point is that fear ward always has value even if all tanks have a fear ward assigned -  just diminished value after tanks get one.
---
Once all the tanks are FW (30 sec CD), you can FW others like melee and maybe a healer or two.
---
Honestly, I won't play a lot, even if I get invited. Because I want to jump straight into a final, finished Classic, ready to play, with no need to report bugs. 
---
Just like 92 is halfway to 99.
---
No, the exact opposite.   
---
You won't be able to throw a rock without hitting a warrior.  
---
Goodluck finding a druid. 
---
Horde: jump on the roof of the building next to blacksmith in Darkshire, here: https://imgur.com/a/G6mexE0
---
It's a tricky jump, climb on the small hills behind the building and try to jump on the corner of the roof, it takes a few tries but once you're there you can basically nuke entire village with your spells. I almost got banned for sitting there for 30 minutes on Nost :) 
---
Are you referring to all pserver streamers or some in specific? Because none of this is true.
---
Even in five mans, proper use of curses is what separates the good locks from the scrubs.  In a group with a hunter and rogue dps and a warrior tank?  Drop recklessness on the mobs to do 3x more damage than agony.  Someone accidentally pulls an extra pack?  Tab target weakness on each of them to mitigate and fear juggle one of them with weakness/recklessness.  Lock's really have a solution for every problem; the only thing I'm going to miss in vanilla is being able to talent howl of fear down to an instant cast.
---
True, that dude has saved my ass countless times
---
Nothing better than a good Hillsbrad Foothills back and forth between Southshore and Tauren Mill until your AV queue popped.
---
I’ve only leveled up in a duo in vanilla. I don’t really like joy leveling that much so having a buddy makes it more fun. Also playing a warrior having any other class with you makes it feel faster even if you need to collect double drops for every quest. 
---
I've thought about this in a different way but not looked into it at all -- what is the mid way point in terms of experience required? It's probably somewhere in the mid-late 40s.
---
100% agree with you. FW is heavily overrated - yes it's useful and raid leaders will probably try and pick a dwarf priest whenever they can, but they really shouldn't turn down a human or nelf priest when they can provide the skill/gear needed. Let's be real for a second, classic wasn't the most complex expansion in terms of raid mechanics. Stance dancing will be the bare minimum that's expected from capable tanks, as they won't have much else to worry about.
---
Sounds about right.  Given you need 4,084,700 xp to level from 1 to 60, half of that lands you solidly at level 47.  44 makes sense as a matter of quests becoming a bit more dense on the high end versus the low end, so those last few hundred k are quicker to level through than the initial 2mil.  
---
Haha ok cool. I am rolling druid because of the utility and lack of player base, besides the fact it is truly one if the few classes I have never played.  
---
Thank you.
---
That's just a very specific example, though. Every class has a niche power. The mage for example, can AOE melt the biggest groups of mobs faster than anyone else (using blizz/nova).  The Hunter can kite anything indefinitely. The druid can, well, turn into a sealion and  be useless.
---
I'm not saying the Warlock is bad or anything, in fact it has one of the strongest class fantasies as already mentioned here. It's just too much of a hassle to play, and is not such a potent *direct* damage dealer, unlike a rogue, warrior or mage.
---
Inb4 3k shadowbolt crits, but still. I never liked the idea of applying 3 different dots on an enemy each time and relying on a pet to keep it occupied while I micro-manage 80% of my inventory which happens to be stones and shards.
---
Don’t hype yourself up for an announcement at pax chances are it won’t be related to classic 
---
Yea i goto say bc was prime warlock time. Probably the strongest dps class in the game for pvp and pve throughout the xpac
---
&gt;with this level of hype, a beta would behave almost like an actual launch, but only for a select elite of nolifers content creators and streamers.
---
Honestly, that would be not a bad option. On streams, not only the players, but also watchers would spot the bugs. And those, who wanted to play, would be quite hyped up by the streams - but that shouldn't happen more than a few weeks before release.
---
But, honestly, I believe that beta should be available to more wider audience, but instead, on the NDA. With 3 months of beta, players would be able to get into late game, and NDA means no hype-killing streams for 3 months. Even if there is no secret, because all the content is already known - the NDA would make sense.
---
I wish we could ban the people making all these stupid posts instead.
---
he specifically excluded the tanks though...
---
I just have a few things to say to all this.
---
1. I don't think pserver streamers should be banned. How is Blizz going to prove a streamer is any specific player on an official server if they don't share their account name, character name, and server while streaming private servers after Classic launches? Blizz has been very uncharacteristically tolerant of private servers and discussions of private servers (as long as you don't name them outright). Just up and banning them all of a sudden would be an odd thing for them to do before Classic launches.
---
2. I agree that there's at least a portion of the pserver crowd who mistakenly thinks this project happened because they signed a petition. It's happening because of copyright and abandonware reasons. It's to protect their own intellectual property, and will probably give more weight to shutting down private servers in countries that have thus far poorly enforced copyright (France for instance).
---
3. Streamers and their groupies are not a new thing to WoW and probably not going anywhere anytime soon. Best get used to it, and wait to pick a server until after launch hype and you know which server the popular streamers are playing on. Or, you know, live and let live, and who knows, you might find your server celebrity/ies are perfectly normal, decent people and competent players.
---
Yes that is accurate.
---
We just grouped up on the warrior.
---
Considering he played rogue up till wrath (forget if he played after) I'm pretty sure he loved the the class, just not how broken they were.
---
It would not be great. I don't care about these people. But it seems you do, so hoping it works out for you.
---
The ability to just pop out of no where with a big heal can be huge when helping to defend a point in AB against incoming mages/locks who would be looking for someone to CC
---
&gt;Rebirth as a normal resurrection
---
would save so much salt but I wouldn't give up battle rez tbh
---
Yeah, it used to be a naturally occurring source of noobies looking for help and sarcastic answers, both rife with spelling errors. And it was all amusing and entertaining in its own way.
---
Now its just a bunch of people who heard that Barrens chat is where you go to "epic trollz" and spam dumb 4chan memes and shit.
---
When your guild is rallying for raids, Mages can pretend to be Warlocks and say "please click the summoning portal", then cast Teleport: Darnassus. If people aren't really paying much attention they'll just click it and get ported halfway across the world. Good for griefing your own faction. 
---
Bandages health pots and swiftness pots as much Stam/health gear as possible spell dmg doesn't mean anything for farming
---
*kek*
---
&gt;And people abused that shit to level even faster than you normally could.
---
Implying you can't abuse sharding? 
---
a list for griefing? imagine being that much of a bitch
---
I'd give anything to hear Happy Hour Tavern again. Those guys were funny and enthusiastic. 
---
But you have a memory of it! Which is more than I can say for much of the questing experience post-vanilla.
---
The last part might be referring to a certain pserver that spent donation money on bills and vacations. The big rub was not as much angry that the admins want to be paid for their work turns out, but more that there was zero transparency about it and people felt robbed and would have opted out of donating if they felt their funds weren't 100% supporting the server itself. It was quite the controversy.
---
Will this be finished before launch? Color me interested as I plan to roll ally after playing horde my whole wow life ;)
---
Just think of Classic Legion in 12 years when shadowmeld will be the best racial for M+!
---
Sleep.
---
Haha the butthurt is so real.  Gonna be a ton of fun with you kids in classic
---
Honestly I don’t, just expressing how great it would be haha
---
Dynamic means it depends on player population, this does not have to be total population. The spawntimers used on pservers depends on the amount of players in a xxx yard radius. If you have 1k players picking 10k veins, it's no different from having 100 players pick 1k veins for the server economy. 
---
OP is about 1vX.
---
Hs became instant in  cata or mop not tbc
---
&gt;The demo was just a proof of concept. No one said it was 100% authentic, especially not Blizzard. Most bugs were met with the response "Yes, we know that."
---
There were responses only to few bugs, though. That's why all that complaining about lack of communication.
---
On the other hand, the demo didn't include all the bugs, because it was limited. Even if they go through the zones themselves, and check everything, the bugs can appear in the UI, weather system, music looping methods, etc.
---
TIL Illidan was originally a boomkin
---
These "purists" also tend to be people who think private server gimmicks will work in proper classic, things like front stabbing/activating crit effects by sitting.
---
So I ran 21/0/30 as a paladin for most of vanilla.  It is by far my favorite spec.  With a healing set you heal great in 5 mans and raids.  You're just as good if not more efficient at mana because of your higher crits giving you free heals.
---
In pvp and pve ret can put out some real damage if people will have you.  Threat management becomes a real problem tho.  You have pull your punches once you are geared fully.  Going toe to toe in pvp there wasn't a class I couldn't take on.
---
Oh apparently i misread that. Legit no idea what he is talking about then lmao
---
Unless you can use sharding to have near instant respawns on mobs, then no, I doubt it.
---
Someone once tried to tell Chuck Norris that roundhouse kicks aren't the best way to kick someone.
---
That someone was Mankrik's wife.
---
&gt; I don't see why it won't work today
---
Because 15 years later we have sharding technology which would solve this problem
---
I guess that was on the Insane High Pop type of pservers.  I played on Those Other Ones and this was never an issue.   If you triple or quadruple the population while the respawn rate of these items stays the same , I can imagine a problem evolves  and this behaviour..   However I would not worry about it in classic 
---
Came here to say this. Could also just be permanent shards.
---
But you can?
---
You kill a bunch of mobs, then use invites to get into a different shard which has the mobs back up.
---
One server for each region*
---
Simply become the new angwe
---
Well, the majority of people (I think, at least), will eventually get bored of Vanilla, and want to move on.
---
I am looking forward to Vanilla A TON. But I know once I've got all of the raids on farm status, that nostalgia will fade, and naturally, I will want to move on. Whether that is in TBC, or not, depends entirely on Blizzard. 
---
Maybe they'll somehow allow us to port Vanilla characters to a separate TBC server, keeping Vanilla open to those who wish to stay.
---
I wasn't saying everything Allie is short. I was saying the good thing about being horde is that none of your choices are awful. If you don't wanna be short. The idea of being a gnome or a dwarf sounds awful. Worst looking horde race to me is Troll. A race that would look fine except the feet.
---
Lol.... I dont deal with planes at all. I'm in the cyber world :D
---
They do look the part tho. Aesthetics &gt; all. You're gonna be watching the back of that character for a while, you better like it.
---
My first screenshot was me awkwardly running back to Wailing Caverns after a wipe. It was an accident and I didn't know screenshotting was a thing.
---
Too late. Timeline lines up a bit for a classic announcement, if we dont get it at PAX then my F5 key is definitely ging to break in the next month.
---
Good thing it will only be limited to starting zones then.
---
Look at Mr. Bigshot here, shopping at Costco. 
---
There is no real rotation for both Warlocks and Mages, they both just spam shadowbolt/frostbolt/fireball and refreshing Scorch and Curses. Though they have more stuff to do than dpsing the boss like AoE damage, buffing, kiting (for mages), tanking (for warlock) etc
---
My memory wants to say that yes, this was fixed before 1.12. I googled it and sure enough, level brackets were changed in patch 1.7 for WSG and AB. As far as I can tell AV remained 51-60.
---
The solution for later is that the servers merge, as you pointed out. It would be the same as sharding except you don’t get that ridiculous popping in and out feeling of sharding. They could also possibly develop a technology that does permanent sharding within a realm, which would give more dynamic control over the populations of starting zones (i.e they could split the starting zone in the future if needed)
---
I will roll one only if my friends want to play horde, but they'll probably want to play ally for the nostalgia. I'm not too keen on a ally lock tho because of undeads.
---
Using on-screen keyboard to /cast spells.
---
I highly doubt they'll do servers outside of their original sizes, the game was designed for a specific amount of players to share the world. I also doubt they would ever implement dynamic respawns which are basically a necessity for high-pop servers.
---
It was strong but he is right about it not being engaging. Compared to a mage it can feel pretty clunky to play warlock imo.  
---
This is exactly how I thought things should work. This keeps Vanilla realms still populated and you can keep your vanilla progress, but still try out TBC/WotLK. 
---
I can't decide between horde or alliance (it really depends on which faction my friends will play).
---
Enhance shaman or Ret paladin. Will heal groups and end-game. I mained a healadin from Wrath through WoD. I really enjoy healing so that is almost certainly what I will be doing in 5-mans and end-game.
---
An then you run with a shit tank who doesn't know what the hell stance dancing is, they get feared, boom wipe. Id rather have the ability to nullify fear myself. Plus stoneform is better than perception CMV.
---
Sounds like you need some DPS. Kitty Druid should be okay. Otherwise Mage, Lock, Hunter, Rogue. As someone said, stay away from plate, FFS. 
---
Haha
---
I suggest leveling with a warlock or something else because you don't get good aoe spells until level 30 or so.
---
Going to multibox a group of the following:
---
Human Warrior Fury Tank
---
Human Paladin
---
Human Shadow Priest
---
Human Warlock
---
Human Mage
---
Plan is to get them to 60 and then get social with the warrior, ideally finding myself in a raid guild as either MT (switching to Prot obviously) or OT Fury (because MT is a lot of pressure).  I’ll use the multibox stuff if I need to farm an instance for something, otherwise they’re going to be craft/cool down mules.  
---
Never played a tank in Vanilla, so I’m not sure what to expect as far as ease of finding groups.  Might level 5 more boxes if I decide I’d rather farm Dal’rends and other crap from UBRS solo.  Kind of depends on how plan A turns out.  
---
Same. For Science.
---
Never understood why people choose to be worse.
---
currently leveling a priest on a popular pvp server and there's no way i'll choose a pvp server if the blizzard caps are similar. there's neither fun nor any sense of accomplishment involved in getting eridicated by endless numbers of rogues, druids, hunters and lv 60 campers, in fights you simply can't win or run away from. 
---
blizzard should definitely think about creating these giant servers since they've been very popular in the private scene, but you won't see my ass on them. 
---
I plan to roll a couple characters for different reasons.
---
1. Undead Mage/Frost - OP DPS in PVP and PVE
---
2. Undead Priest/Shadow - Mind Control noobs into lava in Blackrock mountain all day
---
3. Orc Rogue/Possibly Mace specced Combat - Ganking lowbies and causing rage quits
---
4. Tauren Shaman/Probably Elemental - Casual leveling because I love shamans
---
Dynamic spawning in a more dangerous world is also incredibly bad for the player experience.  Things respawning faster than you can kill them turns really bad if suddenly everyone else finishes their quest and youre the only one there.  RIP you.
---
I mean, ive had some issues with that on retail even while leveling 'soft' alts.  
---
hookers and blow
---
One of the best choices for leveling. Should be good. Mail your ores to a bank alt as you go.
---
Good luck!
---
Im looking forward to classic because I didn't even realize keybinds were a thing until TBC came out and I know it'll be a lot different. Imagine your left hand on the arrow keys and your right hand clicking spells on your action bar - that was me all the way through plague wing in Naxx
---
Can't help you. Don't have friends.
---
Yeah lets base this launch on 2004. Constant server crashes, disconnects, massive lag, hour long queues, and when you get in you can't do shit because the zone is filled with people.
---
Does casting break shadowmeld?
---
The spells you're mentioning didn't have too many uses but you're leaving out the beneficial aspects of them, they weren't completely negative buffs.
---
Amplify made you take more magic damage but also increased healing received. Useful on raid encounters where the damage is mostly/all physical. Also useful in group pvp where you have dedicated healers.
---
Dampen reduced healing received but also reduced magic damage taken. Useful in world pvp / duels where you don't have a healer. Also used for some raid encounters like Sapphiron where the magic damage reduction outweighs the reduced healing.
---
Curse of Recklessness gave AP but also reduced enemies armor. Used on a lot of raid encounters to increase melee dps on a boss/add. Can also be used to prevent mobs from running away at low HP and aggroing more mobs. Also if you don't have any reliable CC in a group like sheep, you can juggle fears by casting Curse of Reck to remove fear when the mob gets too close to another pack then recast fear.
---
I don't think there is a too many dwarf priests threshold. You'll take as many as you can get into a raid until you have too many priests. That being said, if I was putting together a raid and I had no dwarf priests and I had to choose between a dwarf and race x, I'd probably take the dwarf. 
---
To answer your question. I'd stop giving a shit about what race the priest was after already having 1-2 dwarf priests, but I'd happily fill my priests slots with dwarves if presented the opportunity.
---
Yep.  Shadows / Elements is used for Warlocks / Mages and recklessness is used for melee dps since it lowers armor on the boss.  
---
Alliance, Night Elf hunter: PvP flag with a generic named low level pet like "Boar" or "Plainstrider" outside Crossroads or other populated Horde hub and wait for lowbies to attack pet, get flagged, and kill them.
---
Any faction: camp Humar the Pridelord in Barrens and kill him. Pre-cata his spawn timer was estimated at 8-12 hours and was a popular hunter tame.
---
thinking of starting a nelf or gnome rogue
---
some sort of assassin/hemo spec or daggers and use it for stealth runs to make gold and ganking
---
a thousand monkeys writing for a thousand years might create a Shakespeare novel
---
Our faction leader is a priest.
---
A well enough and you could land them in the middle of Auberdine to get mauled by guards
---
You will spend 1-4 weeks in Barrens leveling up, depending on how much you play. This meant you saw a lot of the same people, making jokes. 
---
Feral druids are considered optimal tanks in early TBC now.  On retail no one ran a feral tank seriously until 2.3 patch.
---
Amp and dampen magic either reduce both magic dmg and healing received or increase both magic dmg and healing received.
---
Good question. At my current rate, I estimate it would take me about 3 more months to finish, which would be right at the beginning of summer. I certainly have a much better appreciation now for all the hard work that Joana, Jame, Brian Kopp and others have put into their own leveling guides in the past.
---
Sorry, by them I mostly meant the rogue “players” he was targeting with the skits in the movies.
---
And opens up new problems.  The game flourished under the old system.  Don't break it because it's not "the latest technology".
---
What would be better though, 20 int + 10 spell power, or 5 int + 15 spell power? There's stamina to consider as well.
---
From what I remember of leveling in Barrens in February 2005, it was mostly a lot of noobs asking for help with quests, dungeons and gear stuff. It was a very active chat compared to other zones so I guess that's why it is fondly remembered. The Chuck Norris meme jokes started coming in later like in 2006, cause from leveling alts in 2006 I remember a lot more memes and jokes in chat, but nothing that offensive. 
---
The game flourished then.  It isn't now.
---
Sidegrade and offspec gear doesn't solve the problem of naxx gear power creep being too fucking much for the gameplay at 60.
---
Warlock was my first true love 💘
---
Oh I hate gnomes with a passion, I think the Alliance should've had blood elves or something as their fourth race. They give gnomes warriors, but when TBC launches blood elves can only roll paladins?Dwarves are alright, you couldn't pay me to play one, but they at least make sense to me.
---
Ironically I think trolls and undead are the best looking races on the horde side. The large frames of orcs and tauren looked awful with the less than great textures from back in the day. Also if you think troll feet are weird just look at orc wrists, oh wait they haven't got any.
---
I was merely pointing out abilities that wouldn't fly in the game today, and why they wouldn't fly in the game today.
---
I wasn't passing any other judgment on them than that.
---
The 40s is the most painful bracket to level through on most characters imo.
---
Woah, we’re half way there, wwwoooaahhh, livin on a (Prayer)
---
Clickbait shit title
---
As a warrior main, that shit ain't funny.
---
Try this: dot people at max range. Fear them. Wait until they get out of it. Fear them again. Use non-instant dots like UA or Immolation. Then Fear them a 3rd time. Keep maintaining 1200 range. Mouse side buttons are great for pet special skills like sleep/spell lock etc. A macro like fear on mouse-over is extremely useful vs enemy healers.
---
Same thing with Westfall on private servers.
---
I stand corrected.
---
Pve was definitely boring, but pvp was very fun as a lock. 
---
Hmm not so sure. He had arcane magic, like queen azshara, the Highborne, which would become the high elves and eventually the blood elves: known mages. 
---
Illidan did try to become a Druid and failed. He was pretty competent with arcane magic, though, so not a failure if he was a Druid. Which means that, since he was a failure of a Druid, he was an arcane mage. 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Highborne
---
“A kaldorei without Highborne blood — such as Illidan Stormrage — could master arcane power if he so wished (and had access to it). In fact, the mastering of the arcane arts was common among the populace, resulting in organizations such as the Moon Guard, the official military sorcerers.”
---
It’s tough to say they’re druids when they don’t know any nature magic. Even boomkins spam wrath, a nature damage spell. Its not like they’re just moonfire spamming lol. 
---
Maybe illidan falls in that in between, like rexxar. Rexxar is half hunter half warrior. Or maybe it’s like trying to figure out if a witch doctor is a shaman or a priest. 
---
Do I need spell hit in addition to putting points in shadow focus?
---
Any idea how stamina and spirit compare to int, sp and mp5?
---
The spoof of a typical rogue pvp video at the end of Roguecraft 1 killed me.
---
One of the reasons I'm not gonna miss pservers.
---
Get him to finish mythic 25 in bfa then he will be prepared for classic... Leveling...Classic wow leveling that is
---
If I can reaffirm your decision to play what you like: I played a Troll in Cata and MoP for the minmax and hated looking at my character every day. Every cast. Every movement. Will pick next character based largely on appearance.
---
did the game scale the screenshots down to a certain res? Did OP possibly make the file 1024x768?
---
Yeah it was always lowkey helpful and goofy. Now its just a cesspool and I don't think Classic will really be able to capture that magic. Barrens today isn't the Barrens of yesteryear. 
---
I would actually prefer it if the brackets were changed back how to they were originally at 20-30, 30-40, 50-60. Speficically because shamans get massive boosts every 10'th level, and would give other classes some key skills.
---
I think it was changed because being at the top level in a bracket gave you a much bigger advantage against players who were not.
---
Kevin Jordan has said it before, but it's good to hear it again. The original intention was for hybrids to operate at 90% efficiency (and later on 5% and even less, but that probably was not Vanilla). He then goes on to say that operating at 90% efficiency was not enough.
---
But I do wonder if that's true. When comparing an enhancement shaman to a warrior for example, they're not operating at 90% efficiency. Its closer to 40%. If it really were operating a 90% efficiency, I can't imagine enhancement shaman would be the meme spec that it is now - I don't think it would even really face that much hardship getting into premades or raid groups. I mean to put it into perspective, non-human sword rogues on alliance are operating on right around (and probably even worse) than 90% efficiency. 
---
This was a rollercoaster of emotion haha
---
I don't know why they would answer to every bug. It was just too early for that. They were still doing early things like adding colour to lightsources that didn't have one defined (which used to result in white, but was later changed to magenta to find mistakes more easily)
---
I can't say I'm too convinced of the need for a beta to point out bugs like you mentioned. They will be able to find major bugs without it, and minor bugs are, well, minor. I wouldn't bee to bothered if they forgot to enable rain in Tirisfal, or if the music doesn't properly loop for the first month. 
---
&gt; 2) Professions when levelling - having some use for a profession while you level is so exciting for me. I loved sticking to the 5level rule (keep profession skills at least 5 your level to make sure you keep up). And creating items that genuinely helped while levelling.
---
The only thing crafting professions did to you while leveling was sucked your gold away.
---
Pretty much anything you could make with them, you'd have been better off investing that gold into buying it from the AH.
---
Agreed on everything else.
---
THICCer than a bowl of oatmeal
---
Same, but i can't decide between, rogue, priest, warlock, druid and maybe a paladin or a warrior.
---
I honestly can’t remember if there was ever an 11-20 bracket. I feel like they added the 10-19 bracket after they made the switch. I want to say the level group switch happened around when they added AB? I remember dominating the 31-40 bracket with a few friends because having a mount in that bracket was so overpowered. Then I remember leveling beyond 40 when I heard the switch was happening, and I remember doing AB for the first time in my mid 40s.
---
Gonna give you the tldr since i cant link my  spread sheet but what you need to know that no amount of stam int sp or mp5 is worth giving up spell power
---
The int and stam you get from your spell power gear is all the int and stam you get
---
&gt;  I want for us to sit there and decide which mob to sap and which to sheep.
---
Do high-level mythic+, the planning before a run can take more time then the run itself.
---
&gt; Is that a good plan
---
Yes sir!
---
Gotta note that their german is pretty bad, probably middle school level, which i guess was the average age for many classic players.
---
*Dances in Moonkin*
---
At this point my entire Classic experience will comprise passive-aggressively dancing at anyone who insults the feathered majesty of the greatest form ever to grace a computer game.
---
I'm more of an Aldi man myself but more often than not, I'm at Jewels spending all my money
---
... and my axe?
---
Ita the same with me with a bit of hunter added to the pool...
---
/sitting proc'd crit effects for awhile in vanilla but it was fixed and since we're playing 1.12 we definitely won't be able to proc it by sitting.
---
My Oats are WHOLE WHEAT 🌾 
---
I think it was Kevin Jordan who said on a podcast that Warlocks were not originally part of the plan for Vanilla. The class was a late addition that they felt very excited about because, unlike most of the other classes, it wasn't directly ripped off from Everquest or DnD. Perhaps its that originality that makes you like it so much...you've probably not played or read about many things that are quite like a WoW Warlock. 
---
Currently the choice is between rogue or hunter. I will be playing horde, and I am interested in all content. I love hunters a lot, and the ability to be a Tauren is a big plus to me. But I want a character that I can clear naxx with if I feel inclined to play that much. I heard they become less desirable the further on you progress in raids. Meanwhile I hear rogues are awesome damage at all times and groups usually want more of them. Basically, which class would be easier to get a spot in a raid? 
---
Set bonus for paladin: "Judgement now has an added taunt effect." Hnngggg
---
But that won't happen.
---
i'm doing skinning and enchanting.  You can disenchant anything regardless of your skill level in vanilla practically.  I'll disenchant any junk gear that I deem not worthy of AH to save trips.
---
He didn't like Classic and was against it. Loved his Cata videos. Just not his attitude in later years. 
---
Shaman is also raid useful with terrible gear. Their utility just doesn't need it. 
---
While perception is awesome the ultimate rogue counter racial is dwarf. Simply because its a free trinket against blind.
---
its a number only for a very short time frame
---
Dont forget about mankriks wife...although that came after Norris jokes I think
---
I knew they shipped the warlock unfinished (firestones, multiple redundant spells etcc...) But i didnt know they were a late addition. Considering the lore of WoW, they fit in perectly. This is news to me.
---
But yea, thats probably why i like them so much and why i cant find anything similar
---
Eventually it was turned into a stone in your bags and you just used it as a temporary enhancement on your weapon.  They were actually pretty neat.
---
IIRC the firestone increased crit, and the spellstone increased haste.  That would have been in Wrath.
---
Retail isn't all that different, and sadly classic is likely to be the same
---
Make sure to have chains
---
I just play normally, and I never recall having to grind because I was out of quests in Durotar.
---
Are you on some kind of "optimised" route that leads to that situation?
---
I believe AV was the only 51-60 bracket. WSG and AB were 51-59 and then each had there only 60 brackets.
---
mage
---
That vanilla UI is so timeless. It's so clean, functional, intuitive, and thematic. 
---
So many other MMOs I load up for the full time and feel overwhelmed by the UI and end up quitting shortly after.
---
I wanted their original mounts more than anything 
---
Best answer is going with whichever has the lowest ping for you
---
Really? I love the level 40's (Tanaris/Feralas/Ungoro)
---
Only mid way (after feralas) is a bit of a struggle but otherwise it feels good in my opnion :p
---
Maybe it has something to do with Tanaris being my favorite zone tho
---
This is what I want. 
---
This would allow people to see the same faces day after day. 
---
More importantly, it would obviate the possibility/temptation that Blizzard would re-introduce sharding outside of the original plan. I don't *hate* the idea of sharding the starting zones but I'm in my 30s now. I've learned that temptation and convenience almost always defeat patience. Sharding is, to me, The One Ring. They intend to use it for good but I expect that it will spread. 
---
Racials don't make a big difference in this game. Unless you want to min-max every race-class-combination is viable.
---
 Thought this one was pretty funny. First of all, it's a classic example of our then-raid leader being a complete douche - believe me it wasn't the only time he spazzed after a wipe (though most were his fault lol). Secondly, what the hell was I thinking trying to tank with Lionheart Helm? Nobody knows. 
---
Going similar but prob going to do a 'give me gold and I'll do this instance' route with a tank 2 mages and priest
---
Rolled male dwarf back in vanilla, had to have fear ward for some fights!
---
What class are you because the itemization you would need is dependant on that. tbh alot of dungeon blues are better than epics especially after war effort in aq. the ds1 is all around terrible, ds2 generally has only a couple good peices and even then that's only for specific specializations of diff classes, as I had said before .
---
It's nice to know I'm not the only one who developed a wholly-irrational-yet-no-less-genuine emotional connection to a virtual collection of code and polygons. As far as my feeling brain is concerned, Orion was every bit as real as my actual cat, Tipper, who liked to sleep in the crook of my knees at night.
---
Gods, I can't wait for "summer."
---
Dynamic spawns was limited to population and naturally faded as people spread out and specifically for players who was higher level than others.
---
The only thing a paladin would need is a taunt, possibly as a talent deep in the prot tree.
---
As a warrior, your sole reason for existence is so that we priests can MC you off of a cliff.  
---
That, and tanking stuff.  :)
---
Amen to this
---
What problems does it open?
---
the pair of you are absolute jagoffs
---
Not because of unstable servers and queue times, I can tell you that.
---
I think the list is too short:)
---
[Number one reason to roll a female night elf of any class.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6omsDyFNlk)
---
Ony was a joke though. Also, knowing how mechanics work now, you willingly limit yourself by not choosing dwarf for pve and raid progression. It's okay to choose what you want, but you can't deny nelf priest doesn't get useful healing racials.
---
To be fair, as people became more aware of the game, “wow” probably became a more common search as opposed to the full title. And once any expansions were out, searches would also be divided with just searching the name of the expansion.
---
Originally I was planning on rolling warrior and I still am but in recent weeks I wonder whatever I shouldn't pick warlock instead, especially since Warlock is one class that I never played pass level 20.
---
Other than the fact that this absolutely isn't r/wow where shitpost like this belong, why do you think a 15 year old game would be as popular now as it was when it released?
---
What honestly is the point of low effort post like this?
---
Lionhearted helm is actually one of the best TPS helms in the game so I say you knew what you were doing even back then :D
---
Druid was a FUN leveling PvP server class. Then frustrating to raid with until late BWL. 
---
Warlock was strong but not as fun solo or small group PvP. At 60 I preferred my warlock to my druid in all aspects.
---
Im not denying that shadowguard is good, just offering a counterpoint to "unless you want to play holy all the time and focus on pve only its the better choice" that the other guy said, which I don't see how holds any weight at all.
---
There's a lot wrong here.
---
I think 40’s slows down because that’s about the point where you hit maximum spread on leveling zones, so it’s real easy (relatively) to exhaust the area you’re in, hit that point where the ‘!’ Marks disappear from NPCs in the other level appropriate zones because you’re now more than 4 levels above that quest level, which stops you from knocking out the low level quests that open the higher level quests in the chain.  
---
It gets better after level 50 because at that point you’ve been funneled to either Un’goro/Silithus, Winterspring, the Plague Lands, Searing Gorge/Burning Steppes, or Blasted Lands, and you can start the zones at 50 and usually finish them (with some difficulty) if you can get to 56.  Even if you run out, there are only 4 other places to go compared to like the 12 areas you get in the 40’s, and they’re usually out of the way.  
---
I wana go herbalism and alchemy but I feel like I need to go engineering for pvp
---
&gt;  As far as I can tell AV remained 51-60.
---
As it should be.
---
Good good
---
A while back, there was a huge drama on one of the fresh servers because people figured out how to force the respawns to pop as if the zone was full. 
---
The speed levelers greatly benefited from it, then a week later they dialed back on the dynamic spawns and there rest of the players were stuck fighting over each mob.
---
Okay this is getting out of hand. I know the game was completely new to everyone back then, but 99% of these screenshots show people who not only have  default 0-= binds on the main bar, but also completely unbound extra action buttons. I mean, you had the option to rebind keys to anything else right from launch.
---
I remember quickly setting up custom binds way back then since my little hands could not reach past 5...
---
Not trying to sound elitist, but it's just very weird. Think of how much more efficient a player can be if he sets up proper keybinds to help him use abilities. We're talking a big percentage increase in efficiency!
---
I always liked the 40s; you have your mount, every spec is pretty filled out at that point, I like most of the main zones (although Dustwallow is terrible imo), and Zul'Farrak is my favorite pre-60 instance.
---
I dread 50+.  The only good thing is you're almost to 60, haha.
---
I'd rather have a tank that didn't know what to pull than one who didn't know how to tank it.
---
The downside of a dkp system vs loot council.
---
I had a somewhat similar experience on a priest. Needed the shoulders to complete. Whenever I ran BWL not on the priest, they would drop. :(
---
One of those godforsaken vultures with their sadistic stun
---
A lifelong mage and still a bit torn between rolling a warlock or holy priest. It's going to be torture until release.
---
Agreed.  They both have strengths.
---
Shaman was in a good place race wise. Tauren shaman you got to love stomp stun racial. Troll was great throughput. Orc anti stun was great since stuns wreck shamans. Shaman really took off after LVL 30ish and was enjoyable to level. I didn't raid as shaman so no input other than pretty much every shaman was a cool person. 
---
Always keep lvl1 Frost shock bound.if you PvP. Cancer ability. 
---
Yeah, but good luck making that time back during your scepter or R14 grinds.
---
You should have told me this back then, I completely agree... kinda like those cringeworthy facebook posts from 13 years ago
---
Winterspring 
---
Even if you get him to start, he won't really care, and will quit as soon as something else comes along.
---
I will go skinning mining on my warrior for eventual engineering. 
---
I will go skinning tailoring on my Mage. I will eventually drop the skinning for enchanting. But not until my mount is purchased. 
---
My bank alt will have enchanting leveled up enough to make a wand (10-15?) and disenchant anything sent to him. 
---
I don't need glue for that.
---
Here OP, I fixed your r/wow Shitpost (As u/Maezriel_ said ).

I have no memory of rescaling the image... I found the file where I had backed up pictures from my first computer ( !!! ) and posted the image without modifying it.
---
The reasonable alternative is "suck in up buttercup" and deal with queues.
---
Sharding WOULD be a reasonable solution IF we could trust Blizzard to NEVER use it in any zone past the starter zones, at any time past the first week. We can't trust them, given their 10+ years of fucking up. So sharding is not an option, because it would set a precedent that would allow them to add it much more easily.
---
Saying that tanks can just stance dance instead of using fear ward is just wrong. Fear ward is irreplaceable on Nefarian and Bug Family.   
---
Dwarf IS the end all be all. More fear wards in your raid let you fear ward dps or healers. This dramatically increases your raid damage/healing. This is a far greater contribution to the raid than a measly bonus to spirit.
---
Community and world-building.
---
Read the 15 billion threads on this subject in this subreddit for more details.
---
I'd also recommend staying in your home area unless you're going to another starting area where hunters can be made.
---
Ran into this problem on a dwarf I created and decided on leveling in Elwynn. Basically 0 usable weapons from quest rewards in the whole zone. And of course having to run to SW, take the tram, and find a hunter trainer every couple levels where you get an important unlock.
---
...and yet the game flourished.
---
Against level 63 mobs you will need 17% hit from all sources if you want to cap, although that's mostly impractical so just get as much as you can.
---
Make PvP videos
---
Gorgeous. &lt;3
---
it for sure works and you can absolutely send your pet in and stay shadowmelded.
---
on my low lvl PvP hunter(parked in ashenvale) not really a twink but decent gear, I would park my pet on one side of the road and shadowmeld on the other. With the dragon hawk thing sometimes i wouldn't even drop out of stealth while killing people lol. 2v1 was easy cause I could just be stealthed while I watched my pet kill one, kite the other into a trap then revive pet and fuck off while Kek did his work 
---
Upvoted because Barren’s chat was always just Chuck Norris joke chat...
---
Shaman numbers are very low too, mostly due to being 1 faction. 
---
Those aren't High Elves. 
---
raiding as warlock is incredibly dull, i played one for a bit. only excitement is from worrying about threat, some hellfire anxiety and thats about it.
---
mages have ignite and cc/aoe shenanigans going on and melees at least have rotations and have to jump around a bit
---
I did a bit of hunting for you since you seem into this :D

Go to 1:12 to hear Kevin talk about the creation of the class. 
---
Why is every delusional fanboy such a fucking idiot...
---
Oh, they actually never gave a timeframe on PvP rewards let alone which items to phase out. 
---
Sure, I don't disagree. But the difference is that that everything *before* that is pretty much as he said, button mashing till your hands hurt. Vanilla had that at pretty much all levels.
---
Found the source of the statement, the link on the page is broken but here is the readable part: flintlocke-vs-the-horde/episode-6-to-the-barrens

Just because you can do something suboptimally, doesn't mean you should not try to do it more optimally.   
---
The points you make actually illustrate this. Sure, you can do Onyxia with 40 priests. Should you? Hell no.   
---
Sure you can get through the content with no dwarf priest. Doesnt mean you should.
---
Careful lads, the Blizzard Defence force is out in full force tonight!
---
So what if it doesn’t? How does it limit you?
---
If you mean limits you by not being accepted by a top of the range leet pve must have server firsts guild then that’s no skin off my nose
---
https://barrens.chat
---
Plays a shit spec.  Lol
---
You can play any spec.  It doesn't matter.
---
Yea idk when I’ve looked up the full name lol  probably not since 2004 xD 
---
Wow, just accidentally deleted my in-progress edit. Time to re-edit lol.
---
41.
---
PUG raids in the modern era can be expected to wipe once or twice on Onyxia then succeed. Back in the day, "organized raid guilds" full of angry gatekeeping nerds, who *insisted* on controlling their members' race and spec and gear choices, would go through a long period of not being able to succeed on Onyxia at all.
---
The skill and knowledge levels difference is *huge*. Don't get me wrong, I love classic WoW, but fundamentally this is the same fantasy as "I wish I had my time over to do high school again, I would be the school captain and take the hottest date to prom and also be maths olympiad champion ..." because you're taking the test to which you know all the answers.
---
Classic WoW is literally having your time over again to make better choices.
---
This is what convinced me to alt warlock instead of maining one.
---
Okay so it doesn't create any problems other than some imaginary delusions from fanboys. Great.
---
These streamers in large part are why we are getting classic. If you think we'd be here today without them. You are a wrong. Like them or not they are us and they are a part of our community. I for one would not like to see them banned. That would be some cold shit on blizzards part.
---
trolls are amazing priest healers for sure 
---
Beat me to it
---
I don’t think anyone is claiming that NE has better racials than dwarf in PvP. NE is more fun to play though, because of it’s racial. 
---
Everything that you've asked works, but don't forget that any dot would get your out of shadowmeld and, unlike vanish, shadowmeld doesn't have a grace period of invisibility that makes you stay om stealth even if dot ticked on use of the ability.
---
If only there was a place where *roads crossed*. That seems like it would be a natural place.
---
I feel like that would be a nice addition to their kit.  Make it a sword/shield 2 item set like the Hakkari blades? That could be sweet
---
Shadowmeld is so much more powerful in PvP than fear ward 
---
They could hard cap the dynamic spawns to prevent the instant respawns. Rather than mobs spawning as soon as they die it takes 1 minute. Seems like a decent compromise between 6 minute respawns and the unchecked dynamic spawns we have seen get abused on pservers.
---
After two dwarf priests, human is stronger. I'm still debating between the two knowing that there will likely be enough dwarves around.
---
You mean the people that call out doomsayers for spewing nonsense? 
---
Warlocks are a great experience. Best class quests in vanilla, arguably. If you haven't done one yet, don't rule it out
---
I think blizzard will probably ruin this in todays politically correct environment. Very sad
---
So the problem was easily fixed by volunteer pservers admins once they found out, surely blizzard could figure out how to do the same ting. 
---
Keep in mind Ret was broken until much later in Vanilla. Might be a little more rough than you expect going that way.
---
I don't think I should play on a PvP server. As a rogue it might be fun, but in PvP I tend to panic and press all the wrong buttons, which then leads to me raging and punching walls. It brings out the worst in me, lol. 
---
It's good to know I shouldn't worry about race too much though, I'm sure I'll find a guild that has a pasture waiting for this cow.
---
Summoning people off cliffs as a Warlock was pretty fun
---
😏👉👉
---
just make an alt and get enchanting on him. then mail your greens to him and have him disenchant 
---
This is accurate and hilarious.
---
I don't think you understand how dynamic spawn works. 
---
Mage raiding is frostbolt spam until AQ, so there's not too much going on there.
---
Only reason I am not maining a lock is my group of friends needs a tank while we level and gear up, so I'm going druid bear.
---
Lock is my love though &lt;3
---
Oh yes I did this with my hunter a long time ago, it's a nasty place to be, and swarming with filthy Alliance scum
---
yeah I love undead rogues cause my HOJ actually lands and makes the fight so much easier. orc rogues are so fucking annoying dude
---
Still not decided between rogue or lock for Classic.
---
I'm a DK main on retail, so I'm kinda leaning towards lock. I used to play both rogue and lock back in vanilla and TBC, then changed main to DK. Lock kinda reminds me of DKs, especially unholy has really similiar feel.
---
If I'll go lock, it won't be undead like most of the people, but orc. Imo orc warlock just fits perfectly lore wise.
---
Questionable. It kills off fear for both priest and warrior. Much harder with a warlock, since he can just throw second fear after, but you can trick him into shadow reflector fearing himself much easier after that because he would be thinking more about getting value out of countering your FW than watching closely for your trinket usage.
---
Honestly, there's people like your co workers on retail (at least as recently as Legion, haven't played BFA). Some people just want to log in and do whatever they want to do and don't want to learn anything.
---
Are you denying the game flourished?
---
Blizzard is clearly in cahoots with keyboard manufacturers. 
---
To be fair, once people start playing it, they're not googling it...
---
Well that's good to hear, takes a lil bit of the pressure off. I probs will go for the "figure stuff out on my own, unless I really am stuck" route.
---
If the only partner available is someone who just has to use a helper addon and duo leveling is definitely faster, well...havn't really thought about that.
---
Will there be a way to tell how many people are on the servers at a time? I only remember being able to see Low-High population when selecting a server.
---
If you are aware of these problems and think they are just the "delusions of fanboys", please just play Live.  Don't try to ruin Classic for the rest of us.
---
Dude. You have to chill out. If your post doesnt get as much as attention or upvotes you had wished for, it doesnt equal as everyone else acting like kids. Maybe some time for self reflection on this one? Lets spread positivity here rather than conflict
---
You're a monster.
---
Thats the most horrible thing ive seen made to someone in wow. Its not like making them loose the ship, it literally wastes like 1-2hours of their playtime.
---
Not when you outgear/outlevel/are in the right specs for the content.
---
While a good idea in theory, it's awful here.
---
Classic isn't the place for this kind of changes. Leave that for live expansions.
---
One thing I'm considering is messing around with a Shaman Tank. It's possible via talents and spells. Just not easy and only viable for dungeons from what I understand. Or at least it'll be fun trying to make it viable.
---
&gt; The druid can, well, turn into a sealion and be useless.
---
Druids can definitely solo any world elite mobs with just Entangling Roots + Balance spells alone.
---
Druids can pack farm stuff like the DM:E Lashers just as well as mages and locks as well. Maybe not as *fast* as a Mage cant, but it's quick enough. Quicker than Paladins do it anyway.
---
I spent pretty sure the entirety of vanilla without creating any custom keybinds. I clicked various things. I was in a twin emps, early naxx guild. 
---
Lots of people just didnt bother I'd imagine. 
---
Rogues:
---
1) Sap opposing players, but don't ever unstealth. Just slow down their leveling as much as possible.
---
2) Stalk a player and throw Distract at them while they're running just to interrupt their auto-run or /following... or just to annoy them even if they're just regularly running.
---
As a Priest, MCing is great in all areas, especially in BRM by throwing people into the lava
---
Orc Rogue is hands down the best Rogue. They do comparable damage to Trolls in PVE and have the Stun Resist in pvp. Undead are viable but Orc is 100% optimal. They look like shit though.
---
Talking PvP: Stoneform and Fear Ward both outweigh anything the other alliance races can offer by a mile.
---
A very common sight in a PvP zerg is Warriors going full ham into the backline preferably on a Priest since they lack out "outs" and "oh shits" other classes have and if left alone are too powerful with their flexible dispell and healing utilities.
---
So a Warrior will always try to fear as many people as possible with their undispellable fear, while focussing on a target like a Priest. This is where Fear Ward can save your life, by putting it on someone who can peel off the onslaught away from you until you recover from MS + crits.
---
Then you'll be covered in bleeds (Warrior/Druid) and poisons (Hunter/Rogue), these will slow you down, deplete your mana and health pool. This is where Stoneform comes in: It will remove them and make you tankier for a duration.
---
Think about these situations when choosing a race for PvP, you want to be as surviable as possible and not have slightly more mana regenation or a gimmicky stealth ability.
---
Ya I would have to find the right person I think, but hey that's what this forum is for.
---
Even with a flexible schedule such as mine, the amount of playtime still has to match up, which I guess I am also flexible with. Having a partner there could help get time in too during some grindier sections...like having a workout partner or something.
---
This is why i roll Nelf. Even as a Tank. Nelf it is. 
---
It was even an unwritten rule in our guild that you allow someone with 7/8 to complete their set. I'm pretty sure I just turned my computer off, didn't care to fight Nef after that.. 15 year old me was MAD 
---
Sad, but would make sense. 
---
I remember shroud saying he believes it’ll hit a million views on launch. I don’t doubt it.
---
100% me i made every alt posible then leveled my  "main"  to 42 then i had so much fun with my warlock alt so it ended up being my main for 10 year
---
Had a similar thought; I'm more familiar with 5e than 3.5 since 5e is a lot more recent
---
&gt; It was just too early for that
---
= they were not working on them yet
---
= they didn't know about them.
---
&gt; They were still doing early things like adding colour to lightsources that didn't have one defined
---
no, they had already had it done at the point when they started preparing for the presentation. They were working on crit rates, for example, as stated by one of the blue posts - and that didn't make to the demo.
---
&gt; They will be able to find major bugs without it, and minor bugs are, well, minor. 
---
still, the less minor bugs, the better. And, nobody would complain, if they let an elite of 2000 players in, on NDA.
---
yeah with only mc/bwl raiding as mage is pretty dull too
---
PvP, my time zone, and avoiding any big streamers are my three criteria. 
---
Only when it's 8 debuff slots. Once the game hit 16 (and we still don't know when Classic will roll out 16), Curse of Shadow gains a definite spot, and sometimes a Shadow Priest as well. You don't use DoTs really for most bosses anyway, just add 3 Curses and Shadowbolt spam.
---
*/cast portal: orgrimmar* is da onli wae
---
Even on private servers to this day, dwarf priests are too rare. It is hard to find dwarfs for raids, but human and Nelfs are plentiful. Seems like veryone thinks that someone else will pick dwarf to make up for their choice not to. 
---
Shadowmeld + MC is disgusting, think of how many horde players you can grief with this.
---
Human or Dwarf priest?
---
The min/maxer in me is saying dwarf, but realistically I won't have enough free time to be a regular raider, so I'd be min/maxing for what purpose?
---
I slightly prefer the aesthetics of human, and I do like the spirit racial. Even though this is a huge what-if scenario, I don't want to be stuck a dwarf if we ever get TBC, since fear ward should be available to all priests at that point. (I prefer TBC to vanilla)
---
I can see myself being happy with either choice.
---
They both will have a spec that can manage in 5 mans and still be able to farm. Healing in 5 mans isn't too hard. Paladins can tank, if you are interested in that. Your farming gear will look different than your healing gear, due to +healing and spell damage being different.
---
I think I remember horde doing something similar on the roofs of that town in Ashenvale. 
---
I think you're reading a bit too much into this. The rep thing for example already existed in vanilla with the Bloodsail Buccaneers and the goblin factions, which makes sense from a lore perspective. Tying AD rep with timbermaw makes no sense since they have no reason to hate each other and the reps are both used for crafting recipes. I think that's the joke here, the fact that they have nothing to do with each other. The berserking scaling I'm not sure what it implies because I main alliance. Also Scryer vs Aldor and Frenzyheart vs Oracles also made sense from a story perspective.
---
If you sit down long enough, the sweat glands in your butt cheeks start to excrete glue. This is due to billions of years of evolution and the human genome expecting Classic WoW to release.
---
I think on april 1st theyre gonna say "Yknow why we havent had a release date even though we're &lt; 4 months out? Cause the whole project got scrapped! Sorry Boys!" then april 2nd comes and the post is still there. real sad boy hours
---
Doubt it, if those people don't want to be MC's off cliffs or nuked from rooftops they shouldn't have joined a PVP server.
---
Look into BRD pickpocketing!
---
Your brother prevented his guild from clearing the other half of naxx and you're acting like it's no big deal.
---
I've been playing with this and the naga since wotlk and honestly I couldn't switch back. Having shift, control, alt plus regular 1 - = plus z, x, f, g, etc. is op. I rest the weight of my hand on my palm over the logitech logo and its enough to keep it from moving while hitting the side buttons. My pinky also rests on the side and on my desk to give more support
---
Even though I disagree on the PvE aspect, having Fear Ward is a clear advantage of Alliance in raiding. The huge advantage of Dwarf Priests in PvP over other Alliance races heavily outweighs anything the others bring on a table.
---
That said, as a Priest you will *always* find a spot that fits your style (from casual to hardcore) for both PvP and PvE regardless of your race, so if you want to choose a race based on flavor then just do it.
---
Yeah, that would be sweet. Ranged pull would be nice too. (Outside of trinkets and consumables)
---
I doubt it was his fault. I mean I guess it's possible. A lot of guilds didn't even get to Naxx and the point of the game is to have fun not to min-max all the flavor away.
---
Hold on.. I remember playing hunter in MC/BWL and being top 2/3 on the DPS charts consistently.  There utility is great but I think you are underestimating the amount of damage a good hunter can bring to late game raids.
---
/s
---
If I go Alliance I will be a Gnome "Prince of Darkness". If Horde then mb Orc because that's what Gul'dan is.
---
Neat.  I always suspected halfway to 60 landed right at 45.
---
You are not arguing in good faith here. We are obviously not talking about Priests vs. Pallies but about Dwarf Priests vs. non-Dwarf Priests.
---
Gotcha
---
Stockpile on shit buckets now
---
Please no, don't give them ideas. I don't want to play Classic alone. I mean most of my friends want to play Classic, but if they had to play BfA in order to play Classic, well I guess they would give up pretty fast.
---
So worth it while leveling or farming, being able to meld somewhere and run off to grab a drink/pee break is invaluable. Avoid the long spirit runs from some dick ganking you or a mob killing you.
---
I used it this way on my hunter back in the day. Made sure to get a cat with stealth specifically so we could both hide while I went afk haha
---
I prefer the version wherein the tauren simply stomp in and take control of the Horde. "Nope, sorry; all y'all have screwed everything up too many times now. You're welcome to stay in the Horde, but make no mistake: This. Shit. Is. Ours. Now."
---
You already got a bud?
---
Hunter rhok'delar quest imo
---
Ah yes, the days where Warriors need a Bow and to buy arrows so you don't body pull the entire zone.
---
I love warlock too, I have been leveling pretty much every class on pserver to decide what to play and warlock was one that surprised me the most. I wasn't even expecting to like it, but it blew me away starting at about level 4 when you get Imp. You can dot mobs and have your imp finish them off while you go find the next mob, or loot, or something. No mana issues so you can do that indefinitely. By far easiest level 1-10 and probably 11-20 as well. I soloed a 24 elite rare spawn at level 21 just by continually fearing and popping that void sac when necessary. Void sac is dope to have around and feels so fucking good when you pop it.
---
Multiple viable talent specs. Strong in PvP. You get to eat mages for breakfast. Summon other players. Free mount that looks cool af. Healthstone, soulstone, etc.
---
And I having to use soul shards is pretty badass thematically. The idea that you have to kill shit and stock up some power before you can summon demons/players, cast certain spells, etc, really adds to the class fantasy imo. It really hits home that dark caster/summoner feel you described, without going in to some weird kind of necromancer mechanic that tends to feel gimmicky to me in other games. I'm sure soul shards get obnoxious af when raiding though.
---
If I weren't playing primarily for PvE I'd 100% roll one as my main. They of course bring utility to groups but I much prefer to play healer in group play, so I'll probably be rolling shaman. But warlock is really high up there. After writing this I'm tempted to say fuck it and main a lock anyway. God damn it.
---
At some point during vanilla you were able to cast Aimed Shot while melded, not sure if they removed that before 1.12 though?
---
Tauren Shaman - North American Server - Normal Server Preferred
---
Looking to Raid 2 - 3 days a week anywhere from 6 PM - Midnight.
---
I am a student so I will have a lot of free time during the evenings but I also work. I am planning to be a ranged dps but if this guild is lacking healers, I would be willing to step in here and there. I really want to be apart of a guild that wants to raid consistantly. Can't wait for classic! Message me if you have a discord forming or anything like that. Thank you!
---
Probably hunter, honestly.
---
Rogues will be very, very popular if you are on a PVP server and skilled hunters are harder to come by. 
---
Seems like we had different experiences then. When I played on Nostalrius, basically every dungeon run 1-60 included some kind of CC'ing (more often than not after a realization that we can't actually pull huge groups of mobs). At most there was one "minmaxer" in the group who told us what to CC and what is the most optimal path to take.
---
Sure when I hit 60 and had farmed my pre-raid BiS gear and the dungeon runs had become a bit more of a routine, I knew all the patrols and paths to take but I still had to take part in CC'ing. I'm not sure if you're trying to prove something, but what you're describing is people who have already had extensive experience in the game, further cementing the point that vanilla had all that *before* level 60.
---
Why do you think that having a bit more spirit on one priest is stronger than a DPS or healer not being feared for half the fight?
---
It’s gonna be full of min-maxers, unlike 15 years ago when no one knew wtf they were doing. Personally, I’m not going to minmax my game experience away, and I’m going to roll a human priest probably
---
Why you gotta call me out like thi. 
---
I don't want to be indecisive
---
Warriors are one of, if not the, slowest levelers soo....
---
One faction per realm, it's a no brainer decision with no reason to change it.
---
Hear hear! Thanks for saying what we were all thinking.
---
I mean, I'd certainly *like* to have two servers for each region so the altoholics like myself can play both factions.
---
I'm not counting on that being the case, mind, but as long as we're hoping anyway.
---
Complete? Not really, but here is a great start: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5mh0e/wow_classic_class_guides_resources/
---
...not all duos are faster than all classes on their own...
---
I'm not going to advocate for this, but I'd have found it pretty sick if there was a raid-tier class quest for a trinket that stored souls inside it as charges. Would've been much more exciting than just another soul bag
---
Yes, for Hunters it's huge, because they often have defensive roles. But as a Priest you will be zerging/fighting constantly and not defend points/flags, so Shadowmeld has very limited utility for them. Stoneform and Fear Ward can repeatedly save your ass there.
---
Made this post here looking, for a partner:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b67z3o/leveling_budsteams/
---
Only if you genuinely give a shit what my 5 things are 
---
I’m down for that!! 
---
I don't think anyone actually believes this. Fear ward is directly relevant in 3 different matchups. Never mind you also get Stoneform.
---
"4. Grouping - having a genuine reason to group up while levelling so that you can attempt those harder quests and kill more mobs and die less."
---
This is the whole key to Classic for me.  Accumulating 5-man quests as you level, and then putting together a group to not just mindlessly zerg through each instance, but actually have to communicate with people and use teamwork to figure it out, all while you and your companions are learning to play your class.  Then doing the same to get your blue dungeon gear at 60.  It's so much more rewarding and fun than LFD, and it forms the basis of the community.  Then raiding guilds take that to the next level.  It was great MMO design.
---
I'd probs run that duo with ya. Here's a post I created to find a partner:
---
Does multi-shot expend one ammo per unit hit, or one ammo overall per cast? 
---
It's not OP. It's marginally better and the choice of min-maxers like troll warrior. All content in the game can be cleared just the same with any race class combo.
---
Awesome thanks for the info! Is it pretty easy to install ssd? I've never really done any of that before. I asked lenovo and of course all the other gaming laptops come with customizable ssd or hdd except for this one. Kinda sucks I would easily pay an extra 100 just for ssd 
---
My point was that the tanks technically don't need FW to not lose any uptime on the boss, whereas non-warrior DPS *do.* In other words the marginal value of an additional FW goes down drastically after all the melee have a FW; even further down when all the melee + all the tanks have a FW; further still once all the healers have a FW. 
---
I know that's not how FW is usually prioritized in practice, but the person I was responding to was basically just asking at what point are there so many Dwarf priests that it doesn't matter if they're all Dwarf or not.
---
Why do rotors need silver as a currency?
---
I am hoping it's releasing in July for sweet vacation days
---
That assumes enough people are playing both retail and classic.
---
I for one won't be touching retail with a 10 foot pole.
---
You can skip a rank or 2 of things like claw and bite without noticing much of a difference, but you'll want to pick up new - screech and dive (dash) for your owl abilities when become available (and when you don't have to go to far out of your way to get them). 
---
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
---
Don’t do this to yourself just put yourself in a cryogenic chamber and you’ll wake up to a classic wow 
---
Because there's only about 2 fights per raid tier where fear comes into play
---
Yeh my cousin is my duo partner it’s great because you know family ain’t gonna abandon you. 
---
Barrens Chat is where low effort trolls go to get their accounts banned. 
---
Compromising photos always do the trick.
---
Why are you so angry bro. 
---
That's fair I suppose. I would still rather have dwarf priests.
---
I'm planning on playing an Undead Shadow Priest because I'm dead inside :,) Is this good for solo play leveling and PVP? I want to only do casual raids, but will probably join a guild.
---
nelf female is so hawt tho
---
You use the abilities you do have and get on with the game.  Always fun to watch people not know how to handle you.  I once had a rogue beat himself to death off my reflected damage as a prot pally.  Would have been circa BC I think, but it was hilarious to watch.  
---
Nah felcloth is usually 2-3 gold, mooncloth 20-25 gold
---
Yeah because kr0nos doesn't know shit about making servers and it's hardly relevant since blizzard isn't kr0nos. 
---
Top guilds aren't going to fault you for your race choice. They invite you because of your class choice and your ability/behaviour as a player.
---
Casual guilds don't have any choice, because they are usually starved for utility classes, so they just invite you if you're not an ass.
---
So it is completely up to you. If you like dwarves, pick one. If you don't you need to choose between flavor and superiour utility. And there is absolutely no doubt that dwarves have the upper hand regarding the latter.
---
But I personally recommend to anyone for picking for flavor in that case, because if that is important to you, you'll regret the wrong choice after a while. It's an RPG after all.
---
In vanilla I got my hunter to lvl 55, my friends were aghast as I rerolled a Druid, and brought it to 60.
---
Then I rerolled a warrior and brought it to 60, before going back to my hunter and finally getting it across the finish line.
---
Oh, their patience with me...
---
My bet would be it would just make things even worse. At the moment I start the client, look at the screen, I will know what I will play. Which class I will put many many hours or gameplay in. And I know you will too. ..
---
If you no life it or like playing AH spreadsheet simulator you can make enough money to constantly respec. Most people just pvp in pve spec really. The only sort of serious pvp in vanilla is premade bg groups which is usually less than 1% of players are interested in. If you're just screwing around for fun or grinding honour/rep for a specific item you generally just do it in pve spec. 
---
Second this, I used to click click click away, but once I finally forced myself to use keybinds (despite a terrible dip in my performance for awhile) I came out the other end better, faster, stronger. I think.
---
Yeah this was a serious problem as a warrior. I just PVE’d in my PVP spec and did garbage damage, but at one point they expected me to tank so the respeccing became very expensive. 
---
My advice is to focus on one or the other otherwise you’re gonna spend hours farming gold. 
---
When I first started WoW, I went Human.  I ended up being so sick of it.  Only when a severe guild upheaval and changing servers happened did I finally go Orc and I was much happier with that character model.
---
almost as bad as this guy's grammar
---
classes and classic. An awful pair, indeed. 
---
Too OP
---
Yes, part of it is eating the gold cost. But, there are a few other things. 1. You do them each in waves. Maybe you’re PvE spec for a few weeks, then go PvP spec while content is on farm, then you respec when the new raid is released. 2. You level a PvP alt. The priest class leader in my guild in 2004-2006 leveled a Rogue alt and got High Warlord. 3. You do your raid role in PvP. PvPing Prot spec in full T1 is actually kind of hilarious, nothing can kill you and you do tons of stuns. And a holy priest/paly is actually a god-Tier PvP healer. You can make a much bigger difference sometimes if you stay raid spec for PvP. 
---
Even though they are both caster DPS, they are very different from eachother. It is like comparing a Rogue to a Warrior.
---
I do use voice command for a lot of games, i use voice attack, works quite well. Especially for vr games. Me an q buddy also use it in path of exile for pots. Gets a bit annoying though. 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1234, 1, 1. Lol
---
Just be aware its a very weak class, especially in 1.12
---
spend an extra 2 hours or so farming respec gold
---
yes it is a common problem if u wanna be any decent in pvp
---
only a handful of classes/specs can get away without respec
---
I may be a little, just a little biased but I say it's 2
---
It's nice anyway to have one for instances, but yeah it's a lot harder to just yeet and charge in unless you like dying
---
It stops being "viable" when you get into the 50's, and is only half decent for very niche caster based enemies or mobs, in which any other shaman can tank equally as well.
---
LOL I feel like most people did this. 
---
I mainly did it because I felt like my first char I made was weak (enhancement shaman started @ TBC)
---
And then I made a hunter and he seemed so much better. I guess just everything about my hunter felt like it fit my game play. 
---
Ended up maining my hunter and leaving my shaman in the dust around level 40's lol. I eventually did bring my shaman up to max level, but my hunter took most of my time.
---
Unless you actually played before and know the classes, for completely new players making new chars might not be a bad idea to explore your options.
---
I would recommend Priest/Warrior. Shaman will get travel form that won't be utilized as efficiently when the warrior can't keep up. This might cause in issue mid-game and the shaman wouldn't be able to benefit as much from the neat perk that shamans get. Priest/Warrior would complement each other well while duo-leveling and will always have tremendous PVE value.
---
STARSHARRRRRDDDDDDDDSSSSSSSSSSSSS BOIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
Yeah man, when I make a character, they have to look a certain way, and 9 times out of ten they either have to be pretty or an edgelord.
---
Not true. You have plenty of fun AoE jobs in MC and BWL, not to mention decursing and minmaxing castrange. 
---
 Frostbolt spam is such a meme, it's not even close to the dullness of shadowbolt spam.
---
Which classes can get away without it?
---
the link clankm.net doesnt work?
---
this is our facebook page as well : https://www.facebook.com/groups/clankm/
---
Fun fact: [We almost didn't have warlocks](https://youtu.be/Rd-Zt8bueFk?t=2819)
---
So I have a question: Since we know there will be sharding at starting zones at launch, if you are sharded, are you also chat sharded or not?
---
Actually I disagree on that. Even on pservers there are tons of people who don't min-max these things and pick flavor over utiltiy.
---
Look at the high amount of Undead Priests, Undead Rogues, Tauren Warriors etc. There should be *way* more Trolls on Horde side but they are the least played race. And even regarding Alliance Priests, yes, on pservers the most Priests are Dwarves, but there are still plenty of Humans and Night Elves who are in theory inferiour for all types of content.
---
And in classic it will shift even more towards flavor. I advise anyone to simply *not care* about race choices when it comes to min-maxing. If flavor has any importance to you, then pick for flavor, or you *will* regret it.
---
But sometimes people will bother you with shit thinking you’re a girl, so it goes both ways 
---
that sweet 4:3
---
No one really knows.
---
Most people want servers dedicated to specific expansions. 
---
Let's hope Blizzard does just that.
---
Arms warrior. Haven't played a warrior past lvl 20 ish, looking forward to the grind and to wreaking havoc at 60
---
I remember Blizzard(Might not of been 100% them, but Rob Pardo) tl;dr saying, arenas were a mistake.
---
https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/13/blizzard-arenas-were-a-mistake/
---
Going with the AC comment, Rogue/Druid would likely be best.  Mail and plate are already going to be somewhat contentious with a War/Pally.
---
Cloth is also very intellect driven, so a Pally healer may compete with those.  Iirc, leather isn’t as sought after and probably gives the best balance to your party.
---
I’m no expert, though!
---
This used to be me when I was 10-13 give or take
---
I'm 25 now and I'm gunning for a straight 1-60 human female rogue  main and then a pally second main afterwards
---
I really want a skele rogue but I just don't like how dismal the horde areas are.
---
I can't understand how the horde is where the "adults" play and alliance is for the noobs when horde areas are so dull and depressing
---
I grew up on the sound of stormwind and the warm greeting from goldshire 
---
Not sure why people look at that in disgust ..
---
That’s exactly what I was referring to. We heard it from a devs mouth that Paladins and Druids were supposed to all be able to tank all endgame equally. I would suspect that Ret and some other specs also fell short of their original design goals and I’d love to see them finally get the attention they deserved. 
---
Easy to get that raid invite when you are the raid leaders gf uwu
---
I did that too on an alt - unfortunately I don't think BG's will be in Phase 1. So I expect to level without it like I did the first time.
---
how you ded but still 100% durability tho?
---
not even 40 people in raid thats hardcore
---
&gt; Yeah, I don’t think anyone considered the side effects of LFG. I remember the relief people expressed not having to spam /2.
---
People on heavily populated servers considered the side effects well. People on servers that were basically dead, however found relief.
---
So you did the most sensible thing and waited til you were a higher level before queuing for BGs?
---
Nah, noone else done it...
---
Yep this , 
---
This is perfection. 
---
That is a good one!
---
It was more or less i joined to gank on the Lowbies... 
---
But okay be a dick about it :) 
---
People that hated re-specing used to just level another char of the same class for specific reasons whether that be pve or pvp
---
Which I hope will be the case on classic as well. People should be able to play the race they prefer, not the one that the min/maxing wanna-be-hardcore raid leaders prefer, when it's totally not needed in classic raiding.
---
Felt like eternity with my rogue. 
---
As a father, I can't agree more. Plus shadowmeld + mind control people off cliffs!
---
Well 100% Im not angry so theres that
---
Blackmail? I’d say blackmail 
---
Types opinion, told to chill our.  Noted
---
2 is all you need, anything more is excessive. Human priests have the advantage from a pure numbers perspective. Stronger innervates, stronger Darkmoon blue dragon card..

My first time I chose Warrior and I did commit to that decision from the start of my WoW career until Burning Crusade. I was miserable. BC Came out and I made a BE mage which became my main. I've done Druid as well. 
---
This time? Fuck it; I'm going to alt up the ass. Gonna put a Paladin on the RP realm, the PVE realm is going to be Warrior (so I can do it right), Mage (because I loved it so much) Priest and Warlock (Because I never played them and they both seemed fun)

And I'm going to make a UD Rogue on the PVP realm that I'll probably never touch.

I mained Resto Druid in Vanilla and I really liked it! Not the best healer on meters, but they provide great unique utility to the raid. Battle Rez can save a wipe and Hotting people up is a fun way to heal people. Don't really need to fight over gear much and the "what race do I play" question doesn't apply because you're forced.
---
Barrens chat is for some a nice and also disturbing experience and for others a lifestyle. 
---
I feel attacked 
---
Yes, that is why it was impossible for horde raids to clear bwl and aq. 
---
please explain?
---
Shamans are the second most populated class hordeside
---
Don’t mind me... just bookmarking my spot in reddit for reading after I sleep... ZZZ
---
1. You spend more time blasting through level capped dungeons, then you do doing leveling dungeons. Pre-Bis requires many, many runs, and it doesn't farm itself.
---
2. When you're undergeared for BFA content, you will also struggle with M+10s.
---
/r/homebrewing probably beats it out :P
---
Im a freaking youngin' over there, and im getting dangerously close to 30.
---
Jealousy?  I play as much as I want and I enjoy the rest of my life.  I love streamers of different content, I watch and subscribe to a ton of them.  That is normally what I watch on a different monitor doing work at home or gaming.  I dislike “content creators” of classic wow who ruin the classic experience.  Sorry you feel that Im a failed man because of pserver streamers haha
---
I didn't say the fights were impossible without fear ward. I said it was irreplaceable. There is a difference.  
---
Horde has a little thing called Tremor Totem :)
---
I don't really care about all the hard core raids. I'm rolling NE priest for sure
---
My 14 y/o self in every mmo
---
That sounds familiar LOL
---
The only thing i liked about TBC was it unfuckdd a lot of classes and greatly helped out the specs that generally sucked at every facet of the game.
---
If they got 1.13 talents for classic wow that used up to the 31st pt talent of the TBC talent trees the game would be in a lot better shape.
---
5% spirit is whatever. The real OP human racial is 10% bonus rep. Look at how many fucking rep grinds their are in vanilla and imagine how much time you save by taking 10% off of all of them.
---
My friend and I used to have typing duels where we were only allowed to cast spells by typing them out. It's a really fun way to make things totally hectic while at the same time acting as complete imbeciles.

Eventually the meta evolved to turning on click to move so that you could have little windows to type in between moving.

You are arguing that making a subscription-based game PLAYABLE in the first month is somehow a bad thing, based on some imaginary ideas you pulled out of your ass. You are honestly either too deluded or too retarded to comment on this objectively.
---
Druids are fun in open world pvp because of their mobility and their HoTs/DoTs. Not many can really match up with them one on one in an open world setting. The fights may be long, but the druid usually comes out on top.
---
I enjoy the leveling process more than the end game. I am guilty of this. 
---
So basically Dwarf. 
---
It flourished despite the shit servers, not because of them you fucking idiot.
---
I agree to an extent. I think people should play the class they want to play for whatever reason they want. But if you are a player who wants to maximize their contribution to raid, then dwarf is the way to go. 
---
People here are underselling the value of fear ward. I am trying to express that it is very valuable in raids and shouldn't be seen as "a crutch for warriors that can't stance dance". It is much more than that.
---
However, if you really prefer night elf, go for it. But don't be deceived, dwarfs are more desired for a reason. And that reason isn't that tanks are bad at stance dancing.
---
Damn, I still do this
---
Yet you're the one who's so butthurt about some streamers that you had to make a thread about wishing they'd get banned.
---
Yeah, cant wait to play with the likes of you...
---
Horde tanks just stance danced because it's not hard and much more reliable than tremor.
---
"irreplaceable" is English not your primary language? 
---
I would say hunter is more unique. Everything about them is unique. From the "stand still for 0.5 seconds to autoshot" to the "tame beasts to learn trainable spells" it's so far removed from every other class in the game. They are the only ranged DPS unaffected by interrupts/silence and only half of their damage actually costs mana. Some of their abilities scale with AP, some of them scale with spell damage, some of them don't scale at all. And although warlocks also have pets, the more utility-based warlock pets have a very different effect on gameplay than the hunter pet powerhouses.

&gt; [If millions of people show up and play for years, that’s awesome. And if just tens of people show up and play for years, we’re fine either way. What’s important to us is that we have this Classic experience people can enjoy, that people do have the opportunity to go back to.](https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/)
---
&gt; [One of the things we do know is that by announcing this, **we're in the WOW Classic business forever**. Once that starts, there's a commitment on our end that we're going to continue maintaining those servers for as long as there is a World of Warcraft. I think there will be people that come and do the nostalgia trip, they go to the Barrens and find Mankrik's wife, and then they're done. That's fine. Some amount of people, however, are going to create a new Classic community and that's what we'll be providing.](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-04-wow-classic-blizzard-answers-some-of-the-big-questions)
---
Basically, regardless of whether we end up with BC servers or whatnot, there will always be Classic WoW servers as long as there is WoW.
---
Ive always envied hunter pet diversity. Wish our enslave demon spell was permanent like hunter tame
---
However, one gets a lot more xp per mob and quest in the higher levels. 
---
Hvala brate :)
---
Add to your plan to have your friend go withc alchemy, he can make arcanite bars that blacksmithing uses a lot. 
---
He will then have herbalism making you have 3/3 gathering professions and skinning on the melee.
---
That isn't true. On Nefarian, Onyxia and Bug Family, the fear is cast more often than your berserker rage CD. It is not possible to stance dance every fear on these fights. You still stance dance as much as possible at least horde side, but they have Tremor Totem helping them too. 
---
This is just awful.
---
8 or 16 slots effectively kills off warlock DPS. Yes, Destruction and Demonology warlocks don't use DoTs. But for sustained high mana efficient damage, it's almost impossible to beat an Affliction warlock. And the damage from an Affliction warlock is primarily DoTs. Warlocks are the most affect class by limited debuf slots, but by no means the only class so affected. Paladin Judgements, Priests Shadow word:Pain, Vampiric Touch, and Devouring Plague (assuming you like undead), Rogues poison, Garrote, and Rupture. The list goes on. The debuff limit was due to technical limitations that no longer exist and honestly getting rid of that limit would be one improvement over the original Vanilla that I would whole heartedly approve of.
---
Debuff limit history:
---
Release: 8
---
Patch 1.7: 16
---
TBC: 40 (But raids were reduced from 40 to 25)
---
WotLK: Unknown, but unreachable. So call it unlimited.
---
I just saw " New RageFire Chasm quests added for Alliance players as currently only Horde had quests there. " they predicted the future...
---
So digging into 3e at a quick glance humans really aren't too strong over other races. While they get skill points they don't get any bonus to any rolls otherwise or a senses perk (vision, hearing). And yes 1 extra feat.
---
The skill points are for buying the + rolls which there are a ton because it doesn't roll them into categories like 5e. Like in 5e athletics covers climb, jump, swim in 3e they are all separate skills you have to put those skill points into. 
---
Anywho yeah in other games humans are like that typically but you're just trying to distract from Tauren deserving that sweet sweet mace specialization.
---
Too much work. Install AutoRefresh and set the page to refresh itself every 10 seconds.
---
Even in the days of world firsts there were many successful casual guilds two tiers behind. They would usually get to late BWL and AQ20.
---
The hard part of not being maxed was patience. Casual 40 person groups get held back more from attunement so they cannot start raiding until later. If you're cool with being a couple months behind it doesn't matter. 
---
We have hindsight this time. The game is known. The boss mechanics are known. From pserver experience it doesn't take long to step into a casual raid spot after attunement as they don't need pre raid bis as long as they nail mechanics. 
---
Elemental resistance fights are worse. So many people try to get in without minimal resists. They suck Mana from healers. They do no DMG when dead.
---
Ugh same... I wish I knew what endgame was like and I might have leveled. I made so many characters even making a twink before I had a 60... at the end of vanilla I did get to 60, but with 14 alts 
---
Altoholics Anonymous

Me too man.  I live by the quarry. We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there!
---
Huh, I never thought of them as “offensive” and “defensive,” but that makes sense. I always thought of them as “up” cast and “forward” cast. 
---
Not me.  Staring at Night Elf Chicks Ass &gt; OP racial
---
I want to duel box a Fury and Shaman, solo DME jump runs. would be awesome, shaman can be mining and enchanting. Warrior is main with engineering/blacksmithing bis professions
---
So I'm stuck between maining mage or warlock horde. I work so won't be able to no life. I love world and BG PVP and would do raids for gear mostly. I'm thinking mage mostly for the ability to AOE farm and I LOVE exploring the world and their spells like blink and slowfall are super fun to me. I was thinking undead for each class but seeing how many seem to want to Main undead mage makes me consider a more obscure or seeing which race would be min max for pvp
---
Has limited time to play
---
Wants to main 2 chars
---
...
---
Gotta be careful though, my exwife was a warlock - she cursed me, corrupted our relationship, and then drained 1/2 my shit!
---
Not everybody enjoys min-maxing.
---
Apparently it must of been just my server then or I was completely oblivious all those years ago. Sure felt like Warriors Mages and Rogues greatly outnumbered Shamans/Druids. I had many friends play and was a part of 3 different small guilds. I was the only Shaman in 2 of the 3 guilds.
---
I got so tilted when I saw that. I'm a BC baby, so that was the first April Fool's joke I experienced.
---
Tarren mill* teehee
---
&gt;it is much more than that
---
Well, it's a dps increase in the sense that dps don't need to go out of their way to dodge a fear, like with the dog in MC. What melees need to do without FW is pretty much run to 30 yards with some speed boost, wait for fear to go off and run back at him (or use something like shadowstep). If you have a lot of melee dps this can make a difference sure, but usually it's an even split of ranged, casters and melee, which reduces that impact. The fights are also designed to be do-able without FW at all, so I really wouldn't worry about FW at all. As raid leader I'd try to get dps who are aware of mechanics, not get healers who nullify the need for dps to think at all, even when it's a nice thing in theory.
---
Just my opinion though, I get your reasoning too. I'm simply biased because I cannot see myself EVER rolling a dwarf, and since we probably can't use tmorph I see no other solution than to roll a race I can enjoy to look at.
---
There also wasn’t a few million waiting for  the door to open on launch day of wow, it was months after the game then took off dramatically in subs.
---
Tell em to suck a lemon.
---
Yes i considered the cataclysm, the point is that if it happens to also work on retail, which it wouldnt if it was changed, could be a sign of remnant left from the old world and would be an offical blizzard example of this method
---
Yup, installing an SSD is really simple. You'd remove ~12 screws from the back and pop the lid off, then a few more screws to remove the drive from it's cage. One thing to note is that this laptop only has room for a single 2.5 inch SATA drive, so if you buy an SSD it will replace the 1TB mechanical drive that it comes with. The smallest size I'd recommend is 256GB, but try for a 512GB one if you can swing it. Something like this (https://m.newegg.com/products/20-147-674)[Samsung 860 Evo 500GB].
---
FW is quite good for PvP. It’s interesting to me that when FW comes up, people talk PvE. Stoneform is also exceptional for PvP, especially as a priest. Breaks crippling, viper sting and blind. 
---
Yeah, I'm with you. I really hope I don't get stuck on some streamer's server, I'm not interested in them, unless they're on the opposing faction and I can mind control them off a bridge.
---
you are going to have to stare at your character or a really long time. I have firmly confirmed I will be choosing my race by aesthetics (with the possible exception of going orc warrior cus god damn that is a big difference between orc/human and other races)
---
Nah bro I think he's right. Nobody has ever done this. This is actually revolutionary.  
---
Everyone I know enters BGs exclusively at the low end of the bracket.  
---
This is my opportunity to play Classic correctly. I'm excited.  
---
So I take it you're only doing this on your alt then yeah?  
---
It comes down to what people prefer. You prefer ally and seem to have have nostalgia of the alliance areas so theres that.
---
 I really like the pvp style of Classic aswell, one wrong move can end the duel i really like that. And there arent such clear power gaps because of engineering gadgetz and consumables you basically got a shot against any class ig played properly.
---
I think devs dont do mmos anymore because they're really hard to nail and are a huge money hole for development, compared to something like a mobs or a shooter game. So noone takes the risk and i cant blame them. But honestly how cool would it be to have another classic-like big world phenomenon
---
I don't think they're gonna keep sharding active.  They already said they wouldn't and people would have a fit if they did. 
---
Yes...............
---
yes, that is the joke
---
I've been debating between warlock and druid for months. I've played both extensively on undocumented servers and enjoyed them both.
---
\- Both are great 1v1 duelers and world pvp gods (most important thing for me).
---
\- Both have great leveling experiences.
---
My only choice now is do I want to raid heal as druid or dps as lock. I'll probably end up making both, but man... the decision is killing me.
---
"I'm simply biased because I cannot see myself EVER rolling a dwarf, and since we probably can't use tmorph I see no other solution than to roll a race I can enjoy to look at."
---
Yea, as are most people in this thread. Dwarves are ugly to me too.
---
"The fights are also designed to be do-able without FW at all"
---
True. But, the fight is much better and easier with fear ward. Nefarian is much more enjoyable for DPS because they aren't severely threat capped the whole time. 
---
Don't talk him into it. Just play it when it comes out and if he's interested, he'll join in. Wow (especially classic) is a massive time commitment. Can't expect someone to commit that kind of time to something they're not interested in. You'll find plenty of people to group with. 
---
When I started WoW, I thought the Alliance was boring. Races I had seen time and time again. Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, all races that are very prominent in every fantasy genre. On the flipside, Horde was more interesting, and I didn't feel like I knew everything about the races before I started. The mystery of the Trolls, the brutality of the Orcs, the peaceful nature of the Tauren, and the edginess of the Undead. Each race felt different and exciting. 
---
Eventually I came to appreciate the architecture and feel of the Alliance, but I've still never mained an Alliance character. 
---
http://east.paxsite.com/schedule
---
Sorry bub, im in the same boat but nothing to do with blizzard this year at PAX East, only one very small panel for PvP in BFA (Not even hosted by blizzard).
---
First year they don't even have a booth there:(
---
Female nelf everything animations are the best in the game. The staff style animations are white hot. 
---
People over complicate playing video games. What happened to just playing the game and living in the moment? The good ol’ days,
---
One positive and one negative aspect for each class I'm considering. Change my mind! For PvP and dungeons, maybe some very softcore raiding. T0.5 will probably be a main goal. Horde.
---
Druid (feral)
---
+ Maybe the best spec in the game to fill two roles (without having to respec)
---
- Awkward to gear for PvP and lotsa gear management zzz
---
Hunter
---
+ Unmatched open world prowess and independance
---
- Competition for gear and which need/greed ethics are there for all dat hunter loot..?
---
Priest (disc)
---
+ Most fun and diverse healer
---
- Relative vulnerability in solo world PvP due to low dmg and mobility
---
Shaman (resto and/or ele)
---
+ Low competition for gear, especially when queueing as healer
---
- Gazillion hotkeys. Also anyone with solo world PvP or duel experience as resto?
---
Warlock
---
+ Many quite subtle utility spells and effects
---
- Gear competition with other spelldmg friends
---
I'm also wandering:
---
- Which of these classes do you think is easiest to gear up for PvP and PvE?
---
- Which is easiest to play? Which is hardest to master?
---
- Which is most popular for groups? And least popular?
---
- Thoughts on 0.5 sets for these classes?
---
- Any other thoughts? 
---
Tyvm! &lt;3
---
Who is watching me? 
---
It's not just a DPS increase in that sense. I described it elsewhere, but no fear ward essentially means two tanks have to swap aggro on the boss. This means raid has to stay behind the offtank in threat. The offtank isnt taking much damage, isnt getting much rage and wont be generating much threat at all. He also has to eat fears to stay "offset' in stance dancing from the other tank.
---
The end result is that threat is totally fucked on Nefarian without fear ward, depending on class calls. This is a massive raid wide DPS drop, not just a matter of melee dodging a fear.
---
That can't be true.  
---
It's gotta be like 96 or 97.  
---
Druid can kill any mob solo that can be rooted, eventually.  Turns the hardest elite group quest boss into a joke if you don't mind laughing for at least 15 minutes.
---
This is me 100%. Even when I think I've got every class... I gotta make doubles. Gotta have one on Horde AND Alliance. I said Classic would be different but even now, I'm thinking of all the race/class combos I want.
---
This is why I look forward to playing on a german server again (if they exist). There are usually way less edgy memers...or at least different memes...
---
I actually love the 40s. Tanaris is one of my favorite areas in the game 
---
Perfect application of that quote, thank you. Never thought about that article in this context.
---
&gt; Classic WoW is literally having your time over again to make better choices.
---
Except you know.... all that time I no longer have. 
---
No such thing as an optimal spec for both. But sub-optimal doesn't always mean bad. It certainly doesn't mean you can't raid. You can raid with sub-optimal specs. You won't be getting into a world first progression guild, but few people will. Take a look at any good recruitment thread; 85% of them say "any spec allowed in as long as you put in work and are a nice person." 
---
From posts I've seen here; some warlocks can go SM/Ruin for PVP and PVE. Warriors can decently PVP and DPS/OT with a hybrid build. Druids can go HOTW, be very competitive in PVP and heal most raids in the same spec with a change of gear. Again, they won't be optimal or the best, but a much smaller percentage of players and guild leaders will care about that than represented here. 
---
So really, people can (to an extent) probably go any spec they want and do okay...especially in t1 raids. In vanilla the only reason my rogue with abomination talents and a MH priests mace got into MC was because many guilds by that stage could do MC with 36-37 players. Anyone else was just there for the ride. 
---
So unless you're going for progression and late game raiding (a tiny, tiny percentage of players saw Naxx) you should be able to find a spec that'll get you by in both. The private server crowd may not like it (and that's okay) but if you aren't involved with them and a min-maxing guild I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just learn your class.
---
Is it just 5% for pvp?
---
^
---
A meme that caught me off guard. Good work dude. Had a good laugh at that
---
This is so understated.
---
Our T3 bis druid was so good damn OP. He could main tank MC in caster form to help friends in other guilds. Warriors and shamans after AQ were insane. As a rogue when arena was in beta we would instantly kill most cloth wearers. 2 warlocks with destruction spec in BG's could wipe groups casting the self damage fire aoe at graveyard. We would beta arena naked with just nax weapons no issues.
---
T3 power creep was nuts but T1+ would start to compete in PvP at least. ZG and AQ 20 wasn't terribly difficult and helped a ton.
---
I'm not amazing at lore, but I think Orcs were the original Warlocks so it sounds epic to me.
---
you crazy cat
---
Nah I know what I'm getting into. It's only for leveling. I might try some prot AoE leveling, that's how I did it in TBC but not sure if it works the same in vanilla.
---
I love everything paladin, though, so it's all good.
---
Arenas themselves were a fine addition, the real change was tying the gear to arenas &amp; leaving battlegrounds in the dust. Then it became insufficient to have classes niche in large team games; they had to be viable in 3v3 and 2v2. It was that re-prioritization of class balance that the one dev considered the "mistake". Nobody would've batted an eye if arenas didn't have the BiS rewards.
---
Berserking is a troll racial, he had low hp, it makes his Mojo bigger.
---
Where did you get that from? Didn't find actual Blizzard statistics but from the private server stats I found, Shaman came in 5th. Druid Lock and Priest were lower. 
---
Undead tho
---
... So it is replaceable 
---
Well, there's a darn good reason that dwarves are noted for being heavy drinkers. That reason is two fold:
---
1. Beer goggles.
---
2. Dwarven Females.
---
&gt; could people really be that upset
---
It's the internet, people will be upset no matter what. Don't let that get in the way of good design though
---
kiiiiiiiiinda...thing is your heal efficiency is via crits which Holy Power gives you an additional 5% and can't be understated. Is it as good, no, will it work, yeah.
---
Man, what were they thinking when they felt the need to switch cameras every 2 seconds? One of the most iconic dances in gaming and we don't have a stable footage of it by the original artist. The closest one [I've found is fan made.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3bHEZ5e0t0)
---
&gt; But if you are a player who wants to maximize their contribution to raid, then dwarf is the way to go.
---
Realistically only the 1% care that much and that's only for new content. For Classic, it's a game people have played before, even further minimizing the need to min/max to quite that extent.
---
Post says I can ask about profs so:
---
If I roll Lock, any potential issues with leveling as mining + engineering during launch? It'd be so much fun to have engi stuff while leveling.
---
One concern is major competition for nodes. Also opportunity cost of not taking skinning - leaving some gold on the table there. Although maybe it'd offset if I take the time to keep mining up to date while leveling? Would skinning + engineering be silly? Maybe could nab the mats cheap on AH since economy wouldn't be inflated yet.
---
Other considerations would be Tailoring for easy access to Shadoweave set and BoP tailoring items later on.
---
I disagree that a restriction to a faction is at all similar to restricting them to a race because the impact of that choice is very different in importance. Generally the point of a statistical analysis is to gain some knowledge from it and potentially draw conclusions or even decisions from it. So, what is the goal of the analysis?
---
I'll admit that I chose my words "correct" and "important" poorly. "Important" is, I agree subjective and depends on the goal. And while the analysis regarding the share of paladins and shamans is not incorrect, I'd say that it could be misleading. Currently it seems that paladins and shamans are the two least picked classes according to your analysis. While that is technically correct, it does not show the full picture. Because the (imo) very important distinction of faction exclusivity is omitted.
---
IDK if it will work the same but more for priests:
---
MC the horde flight master at EPL from the right spot and guards will kill it in about 10 or 15 seconds. Immediately run away and/or remove armor to prevent durability loss incase the guards catch you.
---
MC neutral goblins in certain spots where you don't aggro the others and you can one show level characters with the bruisers' gun shot and net abilities.
---
MC people off the boats between continents although this one is relatively well known.
---
Night elves can shadowmeld in various areas and MC unsuspecting hordes off of cliffs (BRD lava, Arathi basin lumber mill etc)
---
I remember running a Stratholme with a NE Priest and they healed us flawlessly the whole time. We get to the party with all of the Aboms and she went into shadow form and I was stunned. I think they were geared really well, but I honestly didn't know much about the game at the time. It was pretty awesome to see that we had cleared without a "healer" up to that point and then she got serious with the shadowform for extra dps at that point. 
---
It is irreplaceable because alliance can't get tremor totem. I guess I should have said it is irreplaceable alliance side. I thought people were smart enough to understand that.   
---
I suppose its replaceable in TBC :p.
---
Yeah, I figured that was the optimal decision. I just wanted to play with my friend while I was his roommate. Maybe I can convince him when it comes out.
---
Why would they not have guaranteed crits on sitting targets in Classic even though it was a part of the game in the day?
---
Well, it shaves off 10% of the time required.
---
I personally wouldn't go human just for diplomacy, personally.
---
Debuff slots really don't effect Warlock DPS that much. The only things you need are Curse of Shadows and Shadow Weaving from your eventual Shadow Priest post 1.7 if the debuffs remain Blizzlike (which they should)
---
Some Warlocks will be Nightfall spec with Corruption, but most of your raids DPS is centered around your melee and eventual Mages when they spec Fire for AQ40+. Most Warlocks will be 0/21/40 - your job is a to have 100% uptime on your assigned curse, spam Shadowbolt and you can use Shadowburn on CD if you really want to tryhard. Hellfire on some AoE bosses like Lucifron, Sulfuron, etc.
---
Group up with some warriors and heal them up and keep STR and WF down and you will be absolutely LOVED
---
Not overshadowed by the short, wide figure you have to stare at while those braids are flying.
---
I'm gonna go ahead and guess that the guy above you is talking about OSRS, not D2
---
You cant miss with a mage honestly. Im goin mage as well
---
Damn it. I was hoping I was mistaken because I only ever reached level 98.  
---
My greatest regret in that game was not doing just ONE MORE DAMN LEVEL.  
---
And then that person quits because "everyone outleveled me and it's no fun by yourself"
---
Bastards... I'm very disappointed now
---
By that logic dual spec improves server stability.
---
I think the DPS in your raid would rather use abilities on Nefarian than sit their watching the offtank barely generate threat. 
---
When you tell them they all have to do a fraction of the DPS they could because this is not a world first  or speed run, and you find Night Elves pretty,  well we will see how much they care that's all I can say. You will have a raid full of HUMAN rogues and warriors that picked their race to maximize their raid contribution, and you just cucked them all because of your choice. 
---
I don't think like you need to reject night elf priests from your raid. But acting like Fear Ward is something only relevant to the 1% / world firsts is bullshit. 
---
Ganking lowbies is for squares. Keep it green at least! Have some honor!
---
The barrens had a unique aspect that other zones in the game didn't.  It was designated for characters anywhere from level 10-25.  In contrast, most zones in the game were intended to provide quests for about 5-10 levels before moving on.  Also, it is the next place to go after the lvl 1-10 starting areas for 3/4 horde races.  Essentially, you have so many people spending so much time in one area that it resembles more of a chat room or hangout.
---
I hope it will not find its way into classic. 
---
I have 4 characters in mid 20s and a lvl 39 on pserver. I’m hoping to get all of that out of my system before actual classic..
---
Imo ele shaman is actually more of a PvP healer than people give it credit for. Everyone is always focused on doing that crit combo, while they forget to heal their team mates. But really shamans flash heal is great and your shocks still crit for 1k, pretty good for an instant cast with low cd.
---
That's how I played it anyway. I think playing like a healing / dmg hybrid is way more impactful than braindead tunnelvisioning on one target
---
if they need a priest, you can get in with some no the best pieces. you dont  necessarily need to have fulliest prebis just around that.
---
ppl usually look at enchants, you need to have enchants (which signifies you put effort into your character), and at least some key good pieces from prebis for your character. 
---
ppl that inspect know all gear, so there is no need for gearscore or stuff like that.
---
It might work, you'll be doing a lot of judgement swapping. Keep in mind most threat for Paladins wasn't based off of damage. So if you try to AoE grind it might work but it's going to take a bit.
---
Then I don't agree with the servers existence then. Im fine with creating your own thing, but not at the expense of us who asked and were specifically granted Vanilla WoW as it was.
---
You won't find much pushback to getting other projects approved and run separately, but you have to understand, the community that has been pushing for classic wow since Cataclysm will never support an idea that just ERASES what they have spent all this time petitioning for, in favor of a completely and relatively new movement/request. That's not fair, and its not reasonable to expect us to be anything other than hostile towards such a thing.
---
To be fair, while troll racials are super strong for DPS.  The original will of the forsaken and built in shadow resistance make undead priests pretty equal as a healer.
---
And if you're going Shadow . . . Berserking is all well and good, but if you have the mana . . . UD Shadow Priests are unstoppable face melting machines. 
---
For what it’s worth I understood your point just fine.
---
Exactly. Highly likely we’ll get Item Gating not progressive itemisation. 
---
Progressive itemisation is far to confusing for most people. That green I vendered a few times a month ago has no turned into an awesome item? Most people will not be impressed. Additionally, item Gating is far far far easier for Blizzard and doesn’t require changing data which they’ve said they are trying hard not to do 
---
Sodapoppin already said he's rolling PvP
---
2 minutes
---
I adore pretty much everything about TBC, and I do agree what they did with classes was terrific, I really believe it was the best state the classes have ever been in.
---
Im actually scared this will happen to me lol.
---
I love some of them dont get me wrong, but the trolling will be real and the general communities will likely be toxic af. Hopefully they all make it known where they are rolling.
---
Oh yeah I'm sure it is. But it'll be interesting to see if I can't have some fun with it though. Never really thought of experimenting with it when I first started back around the Dire Maul release.
---
Pardon my language, but BULLSHIT
---
For an Affliction warlock, Curse of Agony and Corruption are the bread and butter of their DPS. So with a small number of debuff slots, the three specs of warlocks are effectively
---
1. Affliction - Yes, your DPS is quite high, but we don't have the debuf slots to support you. Go away.
---
2. Demonology - OK. Go for it if you want to be a wanna be hunter.
---
3. Destruction - OK. Go for it if you want to be a wanna be mage.
---
You referencing a 0/21/40 spec is due to the restricted debuff slots, an affliction build has significantly higher DPS than that build. But as mentioned, the restricted slots prevent it. So warlocks are required to play as either hunters or mages and never as an actual warlock.
---
Reputation isn't really that huge in vanilla. 
---
And now we're both downvoted lol.
---
I was going to reply to some of the folks here and expand on what you mentioned. A common theme is "well even saving just a few moments is still better than nothing" but they don't consider the overhead of things like a) logging in, b) running from the inn to the place you will grind (and this is level dependent so not the same place -- likely further from the inn than you think) then b) running back to log out in the inn.
---
I say that \*I was going to reply\* because it is clear they do not care about understanding whats going on here. They have already made up their minds, as incorrect as they are. I think you nailed it with #1 above, its an echo chamber in here. Shame.
---
Mage I just two cookie cutter specs too lol. Pick warock, they're played much less often and are just as viable 
---
I dual boxed shaman and warrior back in vanilla and I can recommend it for sure. It's an amazing combo. Would recommend a plugin to use a single keyboard though for sure.
---
PvP didn't give xp in vanilla brah. And yes anyone with a brain waited till they were in the upper range of a bracket to join it. Only a masochist would go in at a low level.
---
Do you have a link for this video?
---
Diablo mobile, ohhh wait...
---
Gnome is the best caster racer.
---
Why would only 1% of players care about optimizing their character? Makes no sense.
---
Cooldown was 10 minutes before they changed it and added the horror effect in 1.8.

Alright, thanks again. 
---
&gt;hey.. where's Makrik's wife?
---
&gt;where I left her
---
hur epic lols
---
I don’t think so because vanilla isn’t about numbers. You bring people because of unique utility.
---
When you’re making a group you just inspect someone and talk to them if you need to, but the general mindset if you’re doing a guild run with some pugs is..try them out, if they fail or suck give them a warning and then kick maybe. Depends if it’s progression or farm, but if you invite a hunter who never Tranq shots the frenzied mobs and it keeps wiping the raid, say buh bye
---
i doubt it. Gearing in Classic isn't so cut-and-dry. Some earlier/lower level gear can be much better than later stuff due to stat distribution and stat weight (which vastly varies by class/spec).
---
I'm an Altaholic but at least I can manage to level two mains to max and play them like 70% of the time. Gotta learn to control the urge to play alts lol.
---
undead priest op
---
Just what I was thinking.  I remember running SFK after twinking got big to get that blue dagger because it was going for 150g on my realm.
---
I don't think there is any need to worry.
---
Gear score in Vanilla looks like this:
---
LFM AQ20 - Gear check on top of bank. (Horde)
---
LFM AQ20 - Inspect at bridge. (Alliance)
---
There really is no need for a Gearscore addon and it would be super complicated to make with all weird bis gear.
---
It does seem like all these builds people chant about are all around end game raiding. 
---
Where is the roll play! Where is the 3 page backstory on your character??? 
---
Yeah definitely me. Just started playing on *ahem* in january and have 1 70, 68, 67, and multiple in their 30s and 40s. Still don't know what to play.
---
I doubt it. There's too much stuff that's great that would score low.
---
Feral for example, would get a lower score for using a level 40 helm and 29 mace, even though those are the best options over "better" level 60 gear.
---
I'm not really interested in tanking, honestly. I briefly did it in TBC, but compared to dps or healing it's just too stressful for me for some reason. For that reason I kinda feel like priest might be the better option, since on the 5-man level they're probably a bit more lenient gear and spec wise to do a middle of the road kinda thing compared to paladins. I think.   
---
Druids look interesting too, but not having an out of combat res worries me a bit, as does trying to find a balance between feral and restoration. So they're probably in the same category as paladins as far as doing both things at once on a 5-man level go. Again, I think, I just don't really know. 
---
A GCD that lets a DPS do damage for 10 seconds instead of 0 damage is not a wasted GCD.   
---
All that mana you have left over at end of fight because of your extra spirit is wasted, though. 
---
Can we please stop making this thread? This has been discussed ad nauseum. 
---
Man I wonder if I can get in on the show during the paladin talk. 
---
Only way I can handle my commute to work. 
---
God damn I love this podcast. 
---
Better than halfway to 99 being 92 (:
---
I don’t think a lot will happen for quite a while, most people will take good time clearing all content and many of us will be perfectly content just goofing around regardless of which phase it is. Most people playing will still be casuals.
---
Long term I hope for BC servers and fresh classic servers.
---
Just tried to search for it but I can't find it. It  was super popular back in the day. It had a female night elf priest rolling around Barrens griefing people with the prodigy song in the background. Maybe someone will remember the exact video name.
---
Just go to the battlemaster’s that will be implemented at 1.12
---
Irreplaceable means cannot be replaced. If the fights can be done without it... That's not the right word. 
---
People don't care as much as you think they do. Troll is currently the best race for Mythic Jaina in BOD in Retail, yet only 5.9% of the 120 population is Troll, number 8 on the list.
---
Hey mate, thanks so much for the love. Unfortunately I’ve already got someone lined up for the Paladin call but by all means please do hit me up on discord via a PM and let me know and if something falls through with who I have then I’d be happy to get you in there :)
---
Be rogue, distract people off thunderbluff, ???, profit.
---
Not to mention that the extra monster kill xp won’t save you total amount of quests needed to hit level 10. Or the curve of XP granted based on quest color. It’s fine man they don’t want our well thought out counter points. 
---
As a speedrunner, this is the opposite of what I do - the bonus training points from pet loyalty are essential for efficient grinding. 
---
The only time I go get another pet are at efficient points to get skill upgrades for my main pet. 
---
I'm thinking about dual boxing a lock and pally combo or lock and mage combo. I'm finding it a tough call. If I dont end up doing it then I'll either just solo lock or mage.
---
Getting prebis for raids is fun and not very hard.
---
There are many lists online with priest bis and here is one that is really good:
---

Baby don't hurt me.
---
Shadowbolt spam gets extra dullness points because it actually persists as one of the top dps specs of the class all the way through TBC even... Thats a LOT of damn years to be running a rotation that spams freaking shadowbolts almost exclusively.
---
Cheers for the kind words, I love discussing these things, so it's really rewarding to talk with people who like to dissect these ideas. 
---
&gt; First of all, how would you implement the raids from later expansions? I mean how do you integrate them in the world? Are Outland and Northrend available as well? Can you get gear and rep and other content from these places? Also I would personally increase raid sizes for these raids to 40 as well (but maybe this goes against your idea of rewarding 40 player raids with better gear).
---
There's a couple of questions there. In the document linked above Outland and Northrend content was presented primarily as an example of multiple content paths, but in my original document they were definitely part of the vision for 'World of Warcraft: Classic Redux' (for lack of a better term), and I won't pretend I still don't want that scenario (Otherwise I'd have referred to them as Path 1 Raid 1 and so on). [I brushed over my original approach to their implementation above](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5at42/a_proposal_for_what_to_do_after_phase_6/ejcdfhm/), essentially I think introducing new continents is something that needs to be done with care. I don't believe adding Outland and Northrend as they are now to the environment outlined in my write-up is a good idea, but I do believe a cut-down highlights reel of Outland and Northrend is fine.
---
As an example with regards to Outland I'd begin by removing Shattrath as a functional capital, using it only as a hub for the Aldor and Scryer factions, and instead introducing two new faction hubs (on the scale of Booty Bay) at opposing sides of the 'continent', these should both include travel links from non-capital cities (this should encourage Alliance players to try and use the Horde player portal if it is closer or more convenient, and vice versa - whereas a portal straight to Orgrimmar would obviously not do that). I'd like to believe that these faction portals would be part of an expanded network of mildly inconvenient routes to Outland, as with the only access to Outland being through the Dark Portal it discourages players from returning to Eastern Kingdom and Kalimdor, unless they absolutely need to. Then I'd make sure that every zone had a defined purpose, or was either removed or significantly cut down in size. My personal ideal director's cut of Outland would feature Hellfire Peninsula for questing at Level 45-55, Nagrand at level 50-60, and significantly smaller versions of Zangarmarsh and Terokkar Forest as one zone. Netherstorm's entire northern half would be gone, limiting the zone to two conservation bubbles at most, and Tempest Keep - in my mind the Horde faction base should be in Netherstorm, due to the Horde's association with Blood Elves (even if they are not a playable race, I'd still argue they should be allied with the Horde). Shadowmoon Valley would mostly be an extension of southern Zangarmarsh/Terokkar Forest, and the Alliance hub should be on it's border. Blade's Edge Mountains would be reduced to a zone that exists primarily for passing through, similarly to Deadwind Pass, as well as hosting Gruul's Lair. 
---
&gt; Can you get gear and rep and other content from these places?
---
Sure, I mean, why not? As long as that gear doesn't supercede 'Azerothian gear', the system works. Your starting point in these new paths could be questing for basic resistance gear. Additionally some of that gear could better suit different characters. There's nothing wrong with the best Frost Mage gear being in Northrend, as long as not all players have to farm Northrend for the best gear, in my mind, although I did think it is best for the sake of a consistent experience if the continent is associated with a progression path. 
---
&gt; Also I would personally increase raid sizes for these raids to 40 as well (but maybe this goes against your idea of rewarding 40 player raids with better gear).
---
I feel that a lot of the content in those raids, although it would all have to be re-tooled, was designed for the size of the groups they allow (Excluding Wrath - but even there, some of the encounters clearly favoured larger groups or smaller groups). With a 40 person raid a lot of encounters would have to be re-designed from the ground up. 
---
I think a lot of it is down to personal taste, but I feel that also supports the idea of providing more options than fewer. Classic already offers encounters for 5 people, 10 people, 20 people, and 40 people. I believe that's a strength something to expand upon, rather than turn away from. 
---
&gt; Wouldn't it make more sense to just get different recipe drops in the other expansion raids or attain the recipes through NPC's in the respective continents?
---
My intention was to try and allow players to further develop their professions in a more dynamic way, rather than being a Blacksmith with 'this recipe' you become an Azerothian Blacksmith with a wealth of Azerothian recipes. Essentially, I wanted to try and further expand upon the specific disciplines that most of the professions have already, and offer yet more choice, but less permanent choice. 
---
Ultimately there's not much difference, beyond another bar to fill, but filling bars allows many players to feel accomplished. WoW's professions, even in Vanilla, are a relatively weak part of the game for the many MMO players who love to engross themselves in a crafting system. I won't pretend my solution fixes that, but I think a level of dynamacy could help that. 
---
&gt;  I follow your line of reasoning in removing dishonorable kills and instead incentivizing the killing of griefing players. However, I'm not sure if this should apply to lower level players. Oftentimes when you're max level you just kill them when they compete with you for certain resources. You shouldn't be punished for that in my opinion. 
---
I agree entirely. That's why I believe a fairly dynamic system is a good thing. I only believe you should have a bounty (as it's a fitting term) applied for a short duration immediately after killing a lower level player (1 minute) and after a significant number of kills. As I wrote I perceived this to be a decaying effect, so if you killed only one person every ten to twenty minutes you should only ever have a short term bounty, but if you went a spree and killed a person a minute, you should quickly get a longer term bounty. Obviously this should only apply to killing lower level players. 
---
I'm definitely keen to see reputation rewards for killing enemy players who are on a kill streak, and I touched on that in the document. Grinding reputation is a relatively straight forward and undynamic pursuit, and I think this could help to encourage players to engage in open world PvP whilst also providing multiple forms of character progression for doing so, and encouraging players to stand up for their faction. 
---
&gt; I'm also not a fan of adding drops to World PvP. Especially the idea of receiving grays or crafting materials from players. This seems to turn them into some sort of NPC. Maybe a separate honor token or something similar could be generated. Or maybe when killing players in World PvP it would increase your rep towards a faction that would reward World PvP specific items. 
---
I feel earning reputation towards a World PvP vendor would be ultimately the same system, but without the feeling of a quest behind it. It also feels very similar to the Honour system, but without the decay effect and competitive nature. Personally I really enjoyed the idea of being able to attach a story and an enemy player to how you got an item, and that's why I put forward that particular system.
---
I also felt the random drop aspect made it less likely it could supplant currently existing systems, but instead live along side them. I worry many players could feel a more sure-fire reputation system was an easier and more reliable method to get good quality gear than engaging in the Honour grind. That I felt would have been a loss to the game. 
---
As for concerns about looting I took the initial idea from looting enemy insignias in Battlegrounds, which perhaps helped me to feel more natural about the system. 
---
&gt; Ever since I started playing WoW, I thought it was pretty weird that a faction would essentially treat you exactly the same from neutral through exalted.
---
Well, you get a discount I guess, but I'd never have noticed when I was first playing unless someone had told me. I think subtle nods to the player and shows of respect from the NPC faction can add a lot to the world, as long as you're not bombarded with salutes every time you walk past an NPC with whom's faction you are exalted. 
---
He just wants you to spell Balorg correctly Trev...
---
You’re right, I’ve missed it out
---
Undead frost mage. Going with pvp spec to use for leveling, dungeons, wpvp
---
It was a bug. It got patched before 1.12
---
You're kind of overthinking it, I promise you if we knew server names now the server populations would balance out when a bunch people decide to go to low pop servers for easier leveling, a lot of guilds will end up avoiding the popular servers on the polls due to this reasoning.
---
Ah np I gotcha lol
---
The undead don’t have any honor 
---
I keep trying to release spirit.
---
It's pretty big if you're an enchanter, but outside that yeah, rep really isn't too important.
---
Idk, when I first started playing I was about the same age as you, and I rolled Horde because I wanted to play the "bad guys" and thought Alliance was boring. Now that I'm older I actually prefer the Alliance.
---
It’s “fucking stupid” to try to make demands for a public beta test.
---
Semantics. How about you address the meat of my argument ? 
---
Imagine a chatroom filled with angsty teenagers trying to be edgy and clever mixed with people asking same 5 questions about how to do certain quests.
---
I'm pretty sure that barrens chat was responsible for birthing the "anal &lt;item name&gt;" meme
---
I remember on Frostmane (NA) there was a bear that sat on the mailbox at Crossroads and all he did was tell stories and join in conversations.
---
A bit too toxic for me.
---
That's very debatable honestly, the only extra DoT you'd be using is CoA (Which you're probably assigned CoS/CoR/CoE anyway and won't be using CoA) and you're wasting that GCD which could be a Shadowbolt or Shadowburn and taking up a debuff slot. Vanilla doesn't need more than 16 debuff slots, raids are simple enough already.
---
Getting preraid bis is fun and not super hard. Here is a nice list to follow:
---
My experience is that you are expected to have full or almost full preraid bis for raids but at the same time if the guild is struggling to have 40 players they will take anything ;)
---
It’s 20 and 21
---
Lol. BRD? ST? ZF? Mara? Yeah, totally
---
Linear.
---
The only real benefit of rolling human over gnome is the fact that you’re not a gnome. diplomacy is just a nice little bonus on top of that.
---
Barrens chat is the result of new players from the Orcs, Trolls, and Tauren sharing the same level 10-20ish zone. So most of the Horde population has to level there or hop the Zeppelin over to Silver Pine. That means you get everything from newbs to people getting power leveled to high level people waiting for the next Crossroads attack.
---
Im trying to shadowmeld but im DUMMY T H I C C and the clap from my ass cheeks keeps alerting the horde.
---
levitate cant be casted on other players.
---
You are asking multiple things here so I'll try my best to not go on tangents but we need a bit of a broader perspective here.
---
First of all crafting professions are generally avoided by people who want to level up fast. For speed levelers that is ok, because they have that specific goal. But for everyone else, choosing a crafting profession while leveling has some advantages if done right.
---
If you are following a leveling/questing guide then it is quite suboptimal to have a crafting profession you want to keep up with, because they are not optimized for it and you will constantly be starved for ressources or waste time gathering these after the fact. So the simple way of leveling up is to "maybe" have a gathering profession and then level up your crafting profession or both after you hit 60.
---
But if you tailor (no pun intended) your leveling to your crafting/gathering and secondary professions, then you will not only save time, but also generate more money in the long run. This requires you to plan your leveling routes yourself and skip quests in favor of grinding.
---
Both herbalism and mining have objects that naturally occur in certain types of areas. Mining nodes usually occur in caves and mountains more often than in the open field and there are zones that heavily favor one type of ore over the other. Herbs function the same but are a bit more complex in that regard because there are simply more types of herbs. So what you want to do is to resarch where these objects are best found with databases and and an addon and then adapt your leveling/grinding accordingly. So if you are leveling mining to supplement your engineering you will absolutely find enough nodes on a fresh server IF you plan ahead and don't blindly follow questing guides.
---
In regards to skinning: Skinning is a highly overrated and overused profession. For the majority of your leveling you will just vendor the vast majority your skins for a small profit that often not even outweighs the time you took getting them. You only start get decent AH prices from your mid 40ies and it gets really good after you start getting high value skins when you are much closer to 60. So the general rule is: Don't learn skinning if you don't plan on LW or at least farming skins at 60 for quite some time. So in regards to your plan on using engineering + skinning: Don't.
---
Also I highly advise you against leveling engineering w/o mining except you do it after you hit 60. Leveling up engineering w/o mining is simply not affordable. You'll spend hundreds of gold for it.
---
I have another plan for you: Level up tailoring and mining. Make a couple of bank alts and store the mining materials there. Make money on the AH by selling Bags and get your BoP stuff from tailoring. After you've done that you can ditch either profession and level up engineering. Or simply do engineering + mining from the start.
---
I told you, choose flavor if you want. But if you want useful racials, choose another race. That's all. It's not an attack on you, and you seem really defensive about it.   
---
You seem like you rather have people pat you your back than have a real discussion. 
---
Alright. I don't know anything about Jaina on retail. But I would ask, how much of a difference does it make to have a troll vs another race and how does that compare to the difference that fear ward makes. 
---
Would be sick for them to make a different expansion after TBC or maybe a new raid. It sounds crazy but I would love it. Probably will never happen tho.
---
What os FAP?
---
I'm the level 60 and the Jerry/clones represent my buddy Guirk. Every time I come back to WoW I strictly have one main and 0 alts. I dump all my time and investment into it. All the while he has like 4 alts that are all decently geared but not current tier.
---
Damn. Was that a later edition? Or maybe I'm mis-remembering it entirely.  
---
It should be illegal to use the big white WoW thumbnail in anything other than blue threads. I though we got a new dose of “soon” and was disappointed.
---
I might be biased because I was on a low pop server the entire time. It was a huge boon for us - BGs and Dungeons.
---
But it's speller Balrog?
---
CC!!!!!!!!!!! 
---
I’m atheist, but if I ever feel my soul dying, it’s when I see a current WoW dungeon run.
---
Roll a priest and mind control people off of tall things.
---
Keep in mind that the cost for respecing is cumulative in Vanilla. That means the cost goes up each time. The cap was 50g and it decayed by 5g a month with a minimum cost of 10g. Doesn’t seem like much but to put it into perspective having a regular mount+riding was 100g and epic mounts+riding was 1000. Most players didn’t get their mount on their own until they hit their 50s.
---
Why 2 command, just Alexa, git me the fuck outa here.
---
That was totally me. 
---
Levels caster to 20something, get my standard SFK robes and shoulders, get BFD staff and ONWARD TO THE NEXT CASTER!
---
no idea, but in vanilla its self cast only
---
Yup, makes fear a reliable CC when the lock can control them if they go the wrong way
---
Where's the stolen silver?!?!?!?!!?!?!!!?!
---
There are never enough warlocks.
---
Summoning will always get one in my groups. Speeds everything up, prevent long repair runs.
---
You always have a spot in any group
---
Can you predict everytime someone is about to stun you?
---
Do you only expect to get stunned every two minutes?
---
Do you have enough enough money to pop FAPs on CD?
---
but why male models?
---
I can imagine you'd be able to get much done in the barrene at level 6
---
I rolled a female dwarf priest for fear ward. I then proceeded to play most of pre BC as a shadow priest focused on pvp mostly. 
---
Then expansion hits and shadow became good for over as well.
---
But do it play a dwarf they're awesome
---
I’m assuming you mean that your goal is to just have multiple classes at 60 in a more time efficient way.
---
Multiboxing multiple characters while you level is much more time efficient than leveling them individually, but unless you’re extremely good at piloting them and develop some crazy strategy it’ll probably take you ~50% longer to get to 60 than it would if you were just leveling 1 character. 
---
I plan on multiboxing 5 through dungeons as I level and in my practice runs at some level ranges I’m actually on par or ever faster than joana’s world record pace from just aoe grinding mobs in dungeons. 
---
You also have to keep in mind that you’re not going to be doing any dungeons while you level unless you’re doing them alone as no one is going to want to take a multiboxer on their dungeon runs, so I hope you don’t mind having no friends for a while. 
---
I felt it fly for me 35-50. Way more things to do 50+ that its like reaching the finish line almost
---
Tauren’s start in Mulgore and Barrons feels pretty warm and happy to me
---
Let's just agree to disagree. To me, it's rather obvious that you don't play a warlock as your main and if by some slim chance you do, you don't play affliction. Affliction warlocks are odd in that they have very low burst damage. But they have extremely high sustained damage once their DoTs are able to ramp up. And guess what? Boss fights are perfect for sustained throughput. But Affliction warlocks can't really be used for Vanilla Raids since they're gonna use 2 debuff slots each. And when I play a warlock. I WANT TO PLAY A WARLOCK! Frankly Demonology is a wanna be Hunter and I'd rather play a hunter than a Demonology Warlock. Higher DPS that way. And Destruction Warlock is a wanna be Mage. And guess what? Instead of a wanna be mage, I'll play a mage. Being restricted to a non-Affliction spec warlock because of a technical limitation that NO LONGER EXISTS is just plain stupidity.
---
On fresh starts, I level with skinning + herb. I then drop skinning mid-30s and pickup engineering if I want to PvP in that bracket. Otherwise, keep skinning until you want eng gadgets. You just vendor skins, so it's a nice little boost to your gold. Herb is better than mining early on because it's easier to level and the lower level herbs are more valuable than ore. Sell herbs --&gt; buy ore --&gt; level eng.
---
Thanks for the detailed response.
---
I’m curious why you say skinning is overused though. Yeah, the drops at low level aren’t worth anything, you’re mostly just leveling it. But around 40 you start to get some ok vendor prices. Sure AH prices are crap, but you’re taking it to vendor stuff not AH. Seems like if you’re not going to level mining or herbs, might as well skin mobs and vendor it for extra income. 
---
I would want to pick a sever without a twitch streamer. Leveling in the same time would be a bitch as well as if you are horde and they are alliance. Or it could be even worst you roll a mage and a twitch streamer picks a mage as well finding a guild will be 10 time as difficult. 
---
You'll just have hordes of kids following this twitch streamer around doing anything he wish. If that means doing a raid on storm wind. Well than you are fucked as well.
---
I will be picking a sever that doesn't have A twitch person on it. 
---
Going for a medium population sever.  PvP so if the worst thing happen the twitch stream pick my realm I can kill him over and over again.
---
Ahh I fixed the mistake.  [Https://clankm.net](Https://clankm.net) is the wrong link.  The proper link is [http://clankm.net](http://clankm.net)
---
Sorry for the scare!
---
I prefer extortion. The X makes it sound cool. 
---
I remember playing a Warlock in Vanilla. Myself and 2 guild mates would swim to the bottom of the ocean (Water Breathing Spell) and invite random newbies to our group and summon them to the bottom of the ocean with us. We would promptly then kick them from group and watch them die.
---
Not to mention that sometimes those weird-ass items that *nobody* uses, find a use in some weird, niche build. The fact that spell power ret paladin both exists and is *on-par* or better for the first half of raids is insane.
---
shadowmeld is useful pretty much all the time tho and can be actually used so often
---
that makes me appreciate the episode a lot more :')
---
Doubt it was "back in the day" seeing the guy named Mizukage after Naruto
---
The red canyons of Orgrimmar before the Cataclysm update were always gorgeous in my opinion. I was a tiny bit older than you but I went horde because I really liked the Orcish story in WarCraft 3. Hell, in the Rexxar WC3 missions you literally clear out Durotar and pave the way for the new capital city.
---
I have no idea what I'll pick in Classic so I'll probably let some friends decide this time around.
---
Mobs have execute?
---
Thank you so much for this idea
---
nope.
---
What always got me about Ele shaman in BC was that it had hands-down the highest DPS in the game, but was held back by threat generation. You could blow something the fuck up, but you'd probably die alongside it.-
---
They've said that multiboxing will be against ToS. I really hope they enforce this. Get out of here with this private server mob tagging BS

I do respect the few that choose to roll nelf despite their obvious racial disadvantage. You definitely stick out in a crowd.
---
&gt;were specifically granted Vanilla WoW as it was.
---
Right I think we're just going to agree to disagree on what this means. Vanilla WoW was an iterative process that had constant rebalancing (I mean every version had major balance changes, and starting in 1.6 every class got a talent overhaul). To use a specific example of the balance, versions pre 1.6 (and really pre 1.8) fury warriors were really not that great of a PvE DPS (and pre 1.4 an enhancement shaman would be on par if not better!). Using a static version 1.12 where they dominate doesn't do a great job of representing the balance of Vanilla WoW as a whole, and does a very poor job of representing Vanilla as a game that was in flux. So to me a version with static 1.12 really isn't Vanilla WoW as it was. 
---
That said, a frozen 1.12 version (at least at phase 6 once all the content is released) does do a good job of recreating 1.12. And what we're actually getting with the progressive content release does a good job of recreating the Nostalrius private server.
---
I imagine you disagree, and see a frozen 1.12 as giving us "Vanilla WoW as it was."
---
&gt;the community that has been pushing for classic wow since Cataclysm will never support an idea that just ERASES what they have spent all this time petitioning for, in favor of a completely and relatively new movement/request.
---
I mean, in the major poll that was done, most people were in favor of additional content after Naxx. So I don't even think you're correct about this. In any event, I strongly disagree that some sort of rebalancing would "ERASE" Vanilla WoW. I mean again, look at the private servers. In progressive MC (which is trying to mimick pre-patch 1.6) having fury warriors top the charts is extremely novel and totally unblizzlike. Yet I don't think anybody holds that this extremely unblizzlike state of balance is "erases" Vanilla WoW.
---
The core vanilla experience is this RPG which really invites you and gets you invested in the world, as a world. You are constantly interacting with the environment, both when you level, and then even later one when you're traveling to dungeons or raids or collecting herbs or just exploring. There's also a strong social aspect to the game where you have a reputation and make friends and enemies, and partake in guild drama and factionalism and so on.
---
This is why things like LFG/LFR and excessive teleporters (makes the world feel like a hub or waiting room that you just sit in until your dungeon pops), same-zone sharding, flying mounts (no more interaction with world, it is just a series of waypoints), and so on are so damaging to the game - because they directly attack the core world concept. 
---
It would be changes like those which "ERASE" Vanilla WoW.
---
Could some balancing attack the core game as well? Definitely, but this would be something which changes the core leveling experience and the way players interact with the world. It would be like retail style where you can take on a huge amount of mobs at the same time no problem. It is basically changing the RPG and world aspects of the game to make you go from an adventurer who has to be careful in the world to a superhero who is above the mere mortal mobs of the world.
---
But class rebalancing to make certain specs more viable? This is totally different from the above, and doesn't unduly erode the "core" of vanilla, if it even affects it at all.
---
Most of them will probably play on a PVE server anyway so we are safe.
---
I much prefer dwarves. Really helps that fear ward is borderline OP.  But hey, play whatever you want.
---
It was WONDERFUL.
---
And it was something that we all wrote / agreed upon that should be done more often.  Especially right after release when servers would be down for hours, talents / spells weren't working right, it just made the  game that.much.more.fun.
---
We had dev's / GM's out in South Shore as those huge gigantic trees just killing everyone on the road.  We banded together as best as gray / green young-uns could, and would just zap, zap, zap 'em, but never killed them.  We laughed with each rez / run back.
---
But then, none of us really understood the entire concept of the game yet, we were still trying to figure out who Mankirk was and why his wife was so damn important.  :)
---
Found the WOTLK baby.
---
blizzard its a company and they like to make money. so I don't believe it will be against the tos. If I am wrong could you provide me with a link?
---
Dear warriors:
---
Forget fear ward, it's for Alliance sissies.
---
Learn2stanceDance
---
Sincerely, an undead healing priest.
---
AQ is when they start dropping off.
---
Orc isn't that amazing in premade but still some of the absolute best and giving bonuses outside of premade makes them the best.
---
This is why I love Classic. The game isn't just the endgame, but the entire game.
---
So if we're talking farm content where you can go like half DPS gear and dual wield without worrying about dying, yeah I can see your point. Dual wielding with all of that is probably better. I do not expect that to be common on progression fights or some of the harder hitting fights. If we're just talking about DW tanking vs sword and board tanking, yeah, you're right dual wield would be better as fury, but I don't expect that to be all that common on progression fights and I don't care at all about what spec people use for farm content.
---
If we're talking about progression fights, Enrage should have low to 0% uptime (as soon as you defense cap out of MC/into BWL), Death Wish is going to be risky and probably not worth it, Flurry is going to have low uptime with your low crit, and Bloodthirst without inherent threat (like shield slam has built in) won't do that much threat. Unbridled Wrath I'll admit looks great, but the other stuff is more powerful when you're on content that's a joke to your guild and you can gear down for speed runs.
---
Also yeah, threat matters in BWL in general (missed/resisted taunts on Firemaw, Broodlord's knockback, just threat in general is good), but why particularly Nef? I don't remember him having a de-aggro.
---
Some mobs do yes, typically named Slayer and they are annoying as fuck.
---
I sure I can get into a group as a multi boxer. I done it before in a private sever with no issue 
---
Some murlocs do too. I think the random mobs with very high shadow, nature, frost resistance or immunity etc is more annoying but it's still part of the charm of vanilla levelling I guess.
---
This was me all of Vanilla. Didn't hit 60 until literally the day before BC released. And the only reason that happened was because that buddy with a lvl 60 toon told me a few months before its release, "Dude, ur not gonna even be able to play BC until you hit 60...quit fucking around!". Yea, I was that noob. Still trying to "get gud" at video games to this day.
---
Just to be sure, you know it can only be used when out of combat in Vanilla right?
---
There will be a warrior trying to fear you in every single BG. Stoneform saves you vs rogues. Fear ward doesnt just save you either, it can save your whole BG team. Its not even a contest dwarf is way better.
---
&gt;Hunter
---
&gt;-Competition for gear and which need/greed ethics are there for all dat hunter loot..?
---
You said you won't be raiding, so who cares. Run dungeons as much as you want, you'll eventually get what you want.
---
&gt;Priest (disc)
---
&gt;-Relative vulnerability in solo world PvP due to low dmg and mobility
---
Are you leveling as Disc? You won't be solo in world PvP often at endgame if you're a healer.
---
&gt;Shaman (resto and/or ele)
---
&gt;-Gazillion hotkeys. Also anyone with solo world PvP or duel experience as resto?
---
You'll PvP as Ele/Resto. Super fun spec, IMO in solo or group. Not the best solo class, but not the worst. Melee pressure is difficult to handle compared to other healers/casters.
---
Unfortunately Shadowmeld doesn't work in combat like it does in later expansions or it would have been perfect!
---
&gt; = they were not working on them yet
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; = they didn't know about them.
---
Uhm, I'm not sure about that line of reasoning. When I'm cleaning the house and didn't vacuum, that doesn't imply that I don't know the floor needs vacuuming.
---
My first blizzard April fools day was 2006 very shortly after I started playing.  
---
Barrens as a permanent pvp zone regardless of server type.
---
Didn’t realize it was April 1st and I was a new player, they got me with that one.
---
No, I don't have a link. They've addressed this point multiple times on stream.
---
&gt;blizzard its a company and they like to make money.
---
can't wait to purchase a level 60 in full raid gear!
---
It automatically threw the thumbnail in there from the source link. Sorry to disappoint!
---
* Chinese government surveillance
---
* Chinese meta intelligence
---
* Chinese farmer wealth
---
Obviously I'm joking. The answer to all three is no.
---
And that's why I'm rolling PvE. Y'all motha fuckahs way too creative
---
&lt;3
---
Know how many times I've healed a 'practice' of the she-dragon so that our alt tanks could learn to stance dance correctly?
---
Know how quickly I trained it when available to Horde?
---
**never**  /s
---
I dont know anything about Naruto but this was for sure back in Vanilla, pulled it from my old photobucket.
---
Her bow animations are definitely top. 
---
If it helps, when I played Priest, nobody gave a shit that I was Human. Holy Priests are so valuable, guilds eat them up, regardless of race.
---
I love healing as a Holy Priest so I will be going with that once again. Not sure what race yet, I was an Undead Priest so thinking maybe trying the alliance side. But I do love the horde designs so will be waiting to see what my friends play as.
---
I plan on going a little nutty and going 16 Disc/35 Holy spec once I hit lvl 60.
---
Dungeons and “starter” raids are my main goals (MC/BWL/ZG) if even possible with my now limited schedule.
---
&gt;All these guides are great and all and I appreciate the time put into making them but why are so many people so rushed?
---
Cause we really love this game
---
&gt;Take the time
---
&gt;Immerse yourself
---
I will while also optimizing cause I enjoy putting effort into things and seeing results, that is my immersion
---
&gt;Make great friends that can last a lifetime
---
Trust me I will, I honestly am so incredibly hyped making new friends and reconnecting with old ones just farming stuff while having a blast :)
---
&gt;Speeding through the content just ends it sooner
---
"Speeding" in this game is still a 100+ (sometimes even 200+) hour thing, and then you're only a fresh 60
---
&gt;Savor the flavor
---
I will, and I hope you do the same however you want in this wonderful game, for me it will be like being a kid again, making more friends across the world that love the same world as me, however they want to play to enjoy it!
---
I was in a group once and a person said  "we where moving to fast." We asked him  "what is taking so long?" He said "he had to open up his spell book." Needless to say we told him he could drag and drop his spell on to his key board. 
---
Oldie but a goodie!
---
Most people won't even sniff Naxx. Basing your class choice on it is insane.
---
Half of this sub is going to quit before BWL is even released.
---
Personally 
---
This is what I'm expecting as well. I'm excited at the idea of having to rethink our gearing strategies for early endgame content.
---
I do think some definite clarification would be good though, as I've seen some Phase 1 BIS lists floating around with wildly different variances. I've made a couple myself, but all have been specifically based around the notion that DM/1.10 added items are not in play and we're getting the buffed 1.10 stats on items that were in the game at launch.
---
Good to know, since I plan on leveling a Hunter alt.
---
Oh, I main a Warrior, so flirting with low health is kinda part of the game for me. 
---
Enh shaman, because you might trick your not so well educated RL into believing that improved windfury totems are a thing.
---
Just thought I'd point out that while it is "semantics" that's not really an argument in your favor when the argument is over whether the meaning of the word fits your argument.
---
The first time I realized mobs had execute was the carrion birds in Shimmering Flats. They suck ass. Pretty sure every carrion bird has execute.
---
I am in a similar boat, only I have narrowed the decision between Priest and Warlock.  I want to play Lock, but PVP healing scratches a unique itch.  
---
I played Druid for an embarrassing number of days /played.  (Vanilla &gt; Wrath) Mostly Resto though..    
---
Priest was much more straight forward than Druid (at any point).  
---
There is a finesse for when to shift, when to Bear and turtle, when to just disengage.  
---
Group popularity:  If you had listed Resto druid, this would be more difficult.  Priest/Shaman wins the popular vote.  Feral is going to be competing with Rogues/Hunters/Fury Warriors even for some slots.  Lock is going to deal with the peoples' love for Mage sheep.    
---
One big thing I suggest you weigh:  How much effort do you want to expend every time you fire the game up:  
---
I would rank them:  Feral &gt; Hunter = Priest &gt; Lock  
---
One misplay as Feral can snowball into losing what was an even-ish fight.  
---
I put Hunter = Priest assuming you are micro managing your pet / traps, really trying to always keep positional advantage..  Also on the Priest angle, having just enough addons to help you make quick decisions without a ton of clutter.  This also assumes Focus, Target, and Target of Target macros for several key spells.  I say the attention needed is about equal.  
---
Note I didn't really touch on Shaman.  While you have access to a TON of abilities, it seems as though you can perform your role to an above average degree without usage of very many.  Certainly less constantly used macros than Hunter.  
---
Other part 2 :  How savvy are you at the ingame economy?  How do you plan to make your day to day gold?  Hunter and Lock win this one for mob farming, with Hunter of course being higher.  If you don't want to respec, a pvp healer needs non mob grinding ways to keep the cash flowing.  
---
With the limitations of Vanilla being so well known:  My 2 cents:  
---
The decision is between Priest and Shaman.  If you like to PVP heal, nothing else is going to be quite as satisfying.  
---
Even if you, by the numbers, farm more gold with Hunter, or have a higher win ratio in fights with Lock, a good PVP healer requires a certain type of person, and that type is not common.  
---
gl hf
---
You will likely not have def cap going into BWL. Look at the gear available. 1.12 itemization means defense gear is nerfed already. You also dont need or want Def cap other than mayb early brood lord kills. 
---
But yep you are right. The vast majority of guilds wont and shouldnt use fury spec during progression. Some top guilds might go straight into MC or BWL with a fury/ dual wield tank in order to push world first/ speed run times.
---
Death Wish is actually not as risky as you think. Stoneshield potion and one priest focused on proccing inspiration is enough mitigation to negate the increase in damage taken. 
---
Maybe if people are having lots of trouble finding enough people for a group.. there is a lot of hate for multiboxing on retail and I don’t see why anyone would take a multiboxer over multiple players
---
Is that a thing?  I used to use distract to help catch up to people for the opener but I've never had someone take more than a few steps before realizing what had happened and correcting their heading. 
---
Well if you cannot provide me with a link than I guess I going to be multi boxing:D
---
&gt;When I'm cleaning the house and didn't vacuum yet, that doesn't imply that I don't know the floor needs vacuuming.
---
But Blizzard is adult, and when the mom comes with 10 request, Blizzard has better words than repeating "just a moment" for each.
---
Would you want to get 300 messages from Blizzard, each about every single bug you reported, saying "soon™"? You'll probably report it as spam...
---
T0 is really bad though
---
Gear score will not since gear is so variable. 
---
Raider.io doesn’t fit since there is no m+ to track. 
---
Logs will exist- logging is happening on private vanilla servers and is useful. But since those don’t boil down to a single number like io, it won’t be used like io. 
---
I really hate gankers with a passion, but this was still pretty funny despite that :P
---
I'd say silverpine from 10 to 13 or 14 before barrens is a better shout and makes the zone a bit smoother. Love him or hate him Alex did a good horde lvling guide that explains why.
---
I might just have to play the founding of durotar to pass some time before classic launches. 
---
I am not here to argue about the meaning of irreplaceable but fine.
---
Fear Ward means your tank will never eat a fear on Nefarian.  Since there is no other way to achieve this, it is irreplaceable. 
---
It takes good timing and sometimes latency will fuck you but ya. Id sit there all day and knock people off. Same for the bridge in AV. It works better if they are on a mount or auto running too.
---
But warlock just is the most fun class to play. Sure you'll have to bother with threat if the tank is retarded, but you get crits in the 5k-6k range or even higher (I've seen over 8k) and you have so many tools for PvP you don't even need engineering. 
---
Shadow is excellent for solo leveling and pvp, raiding can be rough if you intend to stick to Shadow Priest.
---
If you don’t know, Shadow Priest mana can be rough, specifically in long fights, and hard core guilds will only take 1 for Shadow Weaving, but more casual guilds may take a few more per raid.
---
Also something to note, there probably won’t be a *ton* of shadow priests looking to raid in the first place, so it might now be too rough to get a spot.
---
Where is that? Dragon location or something?
---
&gt;Arguably the biggest enemy in the warcraft universe is the burning legion
---
Not my intention to be a dick, but the Void Lords are the biggest enemy thus far and if the Codex of Blood is to be believed then the powers of entities like Murmur are beyond belief.
---
The Void Lords created the Old Gods to infest planets and corrupt all life on them, most importantly hoping that one of the planets they corrupt hosts a titan world soul for them to corrupt. Like Azeroth does.
---
Sargeras believes that the best way to stop the corruption of the Void Lords is to simply destroy all life, leaving nothing for them to corrupt.
---
It's definitely less than 17, 5 sounds right but I'm not 100% sure
---
&gt;Uhm, I'm not sure about that line of reasoning. When I'm cleaning the house and didn't vacuum yet, that doesn't imply that I don't know the floor needs vacuuming.
---
but, if the floor isn't vacuumed, it doesn't imply that vacuuming it is on the checklist. All I see is the dirty floor - I've never looked at your checklist.
---
By telling you to vacuum it, I make sure that it gets cleared. 
---
I started playing from release but didn't have a level 60 until a few months before BC came out.  I'm going to try and be better this time around.  
---
They changed the intro song to some epic shit.  Not the same without the Beatles 'YESTERDAYYYYYYYYYY'  Still 10/10 classic vid.
---
Here’s my biggest argument whenever I see a priest alliance discussion, horde doesn’t have fear ward, yet it’s made out to seem as though it’s absolutely necessary.
---
There are going to be a shit ton of dwarves, play what you want :), personally I’m going with animations to make my choice.
---
You can't cast levitate on other players in vanilla, sadly.
---
I have similar dilemma. I wanna roll Horde, but the Alliance leveling areas are so Uber. It’s no contest!!!
---
Come to think of it.. I recall getting hit super hard, like crushing blow hard,  by a mob my level and being really confused. Looking back it must have been an execute. I guess I’ll monitor my health better in classic
---
If you're a stealth class, waiting at the opposing factions boat or whatever and killing people waiting right before it arrives. Another stealth activity, hanging out in the other factions capitals, and ganking unsuspecting people coming back pvp flagged.
---
Just play it on the TV in the living room
---
Same. You can really see how Blizzard started going hard into the RPG direction with that campaign. It feels like a WoW prequel more than anything else in the games.
---
Furbolg Medicine Pouch
---
I get real anxiety trying to decide what I'm playing for classic. I wanna try something new, but I loved how pampered I used to be as an alliance warlock. 
---
Carrot on a Stick
---
That may be very true haha. However I still wanna be able to capable of doing it on the off chance I make it that far. Basically I’m interested in hunter but I don’t wanna pick a dps class that turns out to be considered kinda shit by the player base, thereby not being invited to things like that. 
---
As a dwarf main all I have to say is: Never trust an elf!
---
Darnassus, Temple of the Moon. 
---
Nice to know more about the backstory. I knew sargeras was killing everybody to prevent the void lords from consuming everything, but i didnt know they were connected to the old gods.
---
Side question, why are warlocks able to bind voidwalkers if they are the enemies of demons, and not demons themselves?
---
Multi-boxxing is not, nor ever has been, against blizz ToS. Multi-boxxers that get banned are usually using automation software/illegal addons, but it is not against ToS to simply multi-box.
---
Unless this has somehow changed for Classic WoW.
---
These old school 'nilla pics are slowly persuading me to dig my old hard drive out of the pile and see what I can find.
---
Love it
---
gonna have to spend a few hrs gold farming per week for them respecs
---
Yo.... stop hyping our class up like this. Warlock fits me in every way and I LOVED being absolutely pampered as one of the 4 alliance warlocks in our guild lol. 
---
I’ve always wanted  but never got destroyer of worlds, the unstoppable force, and Ashkandi. If I could get any one of those I’d be so stoked
---
Hahaha!
---
I'm rolling alliance this time, partially because i want to be a rarity 
---
Warlocks were very common horde side.
---
Meh.. from my understanding, 5% int isn't that big of a deal. Plus humans get bonus spirit, which for a warlock means more bonus mana since health is a mana resource to them.
---
You probably won’t get it out of your system. It’s a legit sickness!
---
I just fapped. 
---
O and threat on Nef can be an issue if you dont have fear ward and have to tank swap. Or with bad luck on warrior and paladin class calls.
---
My girlfriend usually plays healer. She is the incarnation of the bottom one of these:

---
Apparently it has since been hotfixed, but here's the breakdown of how it helped people for the first month it was out. I think it was just this one world first guild that really race changed en masse. Not many others bothered (not even the world 2nd guild). But the effect was fairly big.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=290112/world-first-jaina-commentary-and-fight-breakdown-by-methodjosh#why-did-method-go-troll
---
In short Troll racial meant that people took a lot less damage for 2/3rd of the fight which is big by itself, but at certain points in the fight less healing means healers can help burst dps, and of course there's the other racial that gives a haste buff which is also good for burn phases.
---
I was going to say something similar! It always felt like a WoW proof of concept, though WoW had already been in development prior to TFT.
---
I feel attacked
---
When will these fools realize we are the total package? Competitive DPS, amazing utility, breezy leveling, PvP dominance, free mounts, oozing class fantasy. So damn good.  
---
Hunters are fantastic in mc and BWL, they start to drop off in naxx but you shine early. Here are some tips to get you started!
---
As a dwarf you need to find a good gun so you can utilise your +5 gun racial, it’s a pre-requisite to get into a raid.
---
You get a hidden pet stamina buff if you have a max trained bear as a dwarf, and it’s similar to a feral Druid. It actually tanks better early in MC then a warrior so the first few bosses your pet will be tanking. 
---
There’s a drop called “book of Tranquilizing shot” in MC. The first few books go to fury warriors, they don’t scale in dps until the later raids so they are brought for utility. DO NOT ROLL unless all the warriors have theirs already. You will need it but not until late BWL.
---
You are a mana heavy class, so try not to use multi-shot unless there are 6+ mobs. Your main rotation should start with a aimshot, then you rotate between serpent sting, arcane shot and auto shot. If you see serpent sting drop off the debuff bar it’s a small bug in 1.12 so just keep reapplying it. When your mana is low, ask the Druid for an innervate...there should be minimum 6-8 druids in the raid because battle Rez and innervate are needed for every group. During innervate you can cast a few multi shots for more dps.
---
You need herbalism as a hunter. To get your Rhok-dolar you have to herb the “petrified leaf” off of a rare stone golem named “Golemagg”. He only spawns 1 in every 10 runs and you don’t want to miss the chance.
---
Other then that enjoy it! Your tier 1 set isn’t the best in stats so you will probably stick with your dungeon set for most of MC, but it does look pretty cool. Have fun :)
---
LOL! I love the rogue comment. I did the same thing to mages in BGs who didn't give me water when I asked.  "Oh, you're almost dead...that sucks \* heals self, bubbles, and runs by\*

[Kargoz's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOcqrIfi0qI) is pretty complete.
---
There are a few things that are debatable but 99% of it is sound advice. The only thing I've had an issue with was the pre-bis and bis gear in his slides. Pre-bis has a few wrong pieces and bis gear for each stage is realistically impossible to obtain unless you've got a corrupt loot council giving you prio.
---
This is a genuine worry of mine.  Steamers and full time gamers were not a thing back then.  I worry I gank the wrong person and I get swamped with hate tells or something.  But then I type it out and it sounds crazy.  Let's hope it doesn't evolve into something like that.

---
&gt; Druid (feral) (...) -Awkward to gear for PvP and lotsa gear management zzz
---
Actually druids are very nice to gear up for both PvP and PvE early on. The dungeon and the blue PvP sets are actually quite good for PvP Druids, because their optimal playstile is constantly switching back and forth between all forms. There is basically no stat that doesn't benefit you in one way or another and the same is true for the epic PvP set. PvE ferals benefit from the epic PvP set as well, and their BiS (forever) weapon is a BoE world drop.
---
&gt; Which of these classes do you think is easiest to gear up for PvP and PvE?
---
Druid, because you'll easily find groups and raiding guilds and they don't compete nearly as much as others for gear because there simply aren't as many Druids.
---
Then Priests/Shamans second. Simply because they are sought out healers.
---
&gt; Which is easiest to play? Which is hardest to master?
---
Interestingly you compiled a list of what I would argue to have the highest skill ceiling classes in the game. 
---
Priests are quite easy to learn because they have a straight forward playstile but as you do more advanced content such as raiding and PvP, you'll find that the class has tons of depth. Shadow spec dumbs down the class significantly but it is still a fun spec.
---
Shamans are very similar if you spec resto for PvE and ele/resto for PvP. Enh to a lesser degree. The class has *tons* of depth in PvP because it has so much utility and you'll be constantly starved for GCD.
---
Druids are weird. Tanking is quite a lot easier than Warrior tanking. Cat DPS have quite an "advanced" rotation but keep in mind that DPSing is very straight forward to begin with, just because you have to worry about way less things than tanks or healers. Healing with Druid is probably the trickiest out of all if you choose the Swiftmend spec. In PvP they are hard to play but at the same time worth it because they can be absolute bonkers.
---
Hunters are probably the best example of easy to learn hard to master in vanilla. They are completely braindead easy and fast to level. They have an advanced PvE rotation and dungeon farming techniques. In PvP they aren't as flashy as other classes but good Hunters excell at being the most obnoxious, pain in the ass class to play against, as they can pretty much grind down anyone even if they just around around in shit gear. Only the best duelers can take them on consistently like Druids or Rogues if they get the jump on them, and they suffer from Paladins and FAP if their Priests and Shamans aren't dispelling enough. Even though thre are a lot of them, good Hunters are a rare breed. I've repeatedly seen good guilds recruiting Hunters because of this.
---
Warlocks probably the best "noob" stompers after Shadowpriests. They also fit the easy to learn, hard to master theme well. In PvP that is. In PvE they are extremely straight forward. Many people compare them to Mages but they couldn't be more different from eachother. Warlocks stay way more in the back, similar to Hunters, and apply debuffs etc while looking for good fears/burst damage on the right targets. You have to kill a Warlock 3 times before you win a fight against them, while their dots are grinding you down.

Fear Ward on Nef can nearly double raid wide dps. It is also strong for every raid tier not just one fight. Thanks for the info but I think fear ward is alot more impactful overall. 
---
It was for many people, their first exposure to the textual diarrhea of the internet, quantified in allegedly digestible form of a chat box.
---
But these days, it's nothing special anymore. Visit any twitch chat reel or play any F2P mmo with a server channel. Witness it and partake in it, because stupidity is community service.

Maybe you should have read the press releases and interviews I gave in which I explained that I know that the house isn't clean because I'm still in the process of cleaning it. I just wanted to give you a glimpse so you can hype up to our summer vacation in my house.
---
And if you don't think I pull through, why do you think I would just because 1,000 people told me in the forums to do it? Do you want me cleaning or sitting at my PC wasting my time on the forums? 
---
True. Just giving the guy a couple ideas of what could of happened if you had been playing at a higher res. They are all wondering why its 1024, I could care less lol.
---
What kind of absolute madman dings 60 on a warrior and thinks "you know what I'll have another". In the time it takes you to level a second warrior to 60 you could farm around 6 or 7 thousand gold, enough to respec your character twice every week for a year and a half straight.
---
I... just... I don't even...
---
The night elf barrow dens. It's a nightmare on pservers because of dynamic spawns, but it's a huge pain anyways because of the sheer mob density. If you die, you need to run all the way back and mobs might have respawned on your corpse if you're unlucky.
---
See guys. Ret. 
---
Tell your tanks to stop sucking and learn how to stance dance to avoid fears, then you don't have to be a dwarf.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info 
---
Starting zone congestion should be way lower on your priorities than racials/what you want to play. There will also probably be sharding in the starting zones so it won’t matter...
---
That being said, mulgore and Teldrassil
---
Thanks man!
---
Mulgore(Tauren) and Teldrassil(NE), won't matter though
---
Well when I played in Vanilla I actually played as an enhancement shaman. And I used a 1H weapon and a shield, if you can believe that. And my guild was definitely will to take me to every raid (i think they just needed the warm body). So I think back in vanilla you probably saw both enhancement and ret a whole lot.
---
That said, it's my understanding from playing on private servers that Ret is more common than enhancement because Ret actually has better nightfall uptime than enhancement! I would expect the behavior on Classic (assuming no balance changes) to mirror the private server more than Vanilla. 
---
I never found soul shards to be much of an issue if you're a pretty active raider. The overall consumables a warlock needs to farm each week for raiding is MUCH less than other classes so farming some shards on the side is pretty minor prep. If you only have 2 warlocks in your raid you might need 40 each, but you can always farm some mid-raid on the trash to restock a little bit. You really aren't passing  out health stones to every raid member, usually just the tanks and maybe some healers. 
---
Cool concept, but I’d imagine undead being 100% permanently immune to fear would make any UD fighting against a warlock super easy, and any fight against a paladin would become super hard with exorcism, turn undead, etc. 
---
What was your original "main" ?
---
I always commit too one main, one endgame alt then go crazy with twinks. Until cata anyway. Then I had 6 85s because it was so easy and content bored me. My goal with classic is one toon leveling with my wife, one for when she cant play and eventually twinks. 
---
Yeah that was it! Good times.
---
I think that's very good advice.  But what's the matter with undead rogues for pvp? Being able to shed a fear will keep you alive against a (especially dwarf) priest until you're rocking 5 piece Tier 1 and can pull of a complete stunlock. 
---
It also turns warlocks with their succi out into a free kill. 
---
Isn’t perception castable? Super situational, but still it was an active ability 
---
A man of culture i see
---
For humans, just the Defias near the grapes will probably be enough; Dwarves/gnomes will be the troll cave; Night Elves the spider cave.
---
Since there's likely to be a lot of people who only started playing in Cataclysm and beyond, they wont be taking these start zone areas seriously and will pull more than they can handle. Even with the zones being packed, all it will take are the guys running around trying to tag lots of things before others do, and getting their painful lesson. Skeletons everywhere.
---
I would say Retadin. I would say neither would be accepted but I have heard you can make Ret "viable" in Naxx. I have no experience with it but it's what I heard. As far as whats "unworkable". I would say Ele Shaman is prolly the most unworkable raid spec in the game. It can do some damage but you will be oom before 20 seconds passes.
---
This is as concise as an answer to this question is going to get. Those things won't carry over from retail.
---
Im really no expert on the lore, but my best guess is that it is just an inconsistency Blizzard didn't want to remove for the sake of gameplay. Just like the playable Undead race are human now, not undead.
---
The lore of WoW has been evolving for two decades now, so when they created the Void Walkers as Warlock pets they maybe didn't know where their own lore would take them or they knowingly ignored it straight away. Warlock's also strive for more power more than anything. They don't particularly care if it is fel magic or not. Void Walkers are probably the weakest force of the Void so maybe Warlocks are simply powerful enough to control those lesser beings who knows.
---
This is me and my brother and unfortunately I'm the indecisive one =( 
---
Altoholic is the term I used with friends, to warn them not to level with me. Over a dozen alts in vanilla that never made it past 20.
---
Hi, I'm BurntPaper  
---
*Hi Burntpaper*  
---
I've been an Altoholic since December 2005. I started out like any of you. I decided I wanted to be a Paladin. A noble warrior of justice and light. Wearing the finest plate armor, wielding holy knowledge to vanquish those that would stand against righteousness. Everything was going well, I was enjoying myself. I was able to stand strong against evil, and give strength to those around me. 
---
But then... I saw the way my brother in Arms swung his mighty axe. The way his enemies crumpled before him into heaps, scarcely hitting the ground to come to their final rest before his axe was raised once more over his head, poised and ready to deliver a deadly blow to the next foe. So I thought, what's the harm? I've made progress in my career as a Paladin. I can take a break and try the life of a Warrior. It will give me the rest I need!  
---
Well, I was wrong. It was the beginning of the end. Soon I looked to another companion. This one stalked his prey from the shadows. Before their enemies knew what hit them, it was already too late; Poison coursing through their veins, the light fading, and the last thing they would see would be two sharpened blades. So I strayed from my path once again, to try the life of a Rogue.  
---
By this time, my original companions had left me behind. I was starting over yet again, in the leather scraps of my low level rogue. They, in their shining armor, mystical glows, and weapons of legend, no longer had a use for me. I'd just be a liability. They went on to vanquish Dragons, Gods of flame and shadows, ancient arachnid horrors. And what did I have? A level 35 weakling. A level 22 pawn. A level 9 disgrace. 
---
The life of an altoholic seems so good. Endless options, always learning something new, being able to follow any path you want. But I soon realized that it is a life of loneliness. A life where you're never as strong as you'd like to be. Soon you're getting kicked from your guild. People you once called friends have made new rules about raid attendance. "You can still hand out in the Ventrillo server", they'd say. But I knew they saw me as a lesser person because of my disability. 
---
Please, don't be me. Stick to one toon. 
---
Lifestone. I still have one on one of my characters. It was the first epic I ever got, even if it did kinda suck. Can't wait to get a real one again!
---
🙌

With a bit of gear, you can farm the timbermaw fairly easily. Firewater and Eko sells fairly well, or just use it for yourself. Once you have the gears for it, if you can solo the chief it was a 60-70% drop rate on a firewater every 5 minutes. There are chests in the area and mineral nodes too
---
My heart belongs to two opposite classes in WoW: to paladins and warlocks (and priests, cause they combine both light and darkness). All three class archetypes are well-shaped, distinct and well represented in Warcraft storyline.
---
Whatever the first cave is that a player enters.
---
This will get you banned if the guards can’t get you 
---
Just as an aside about Orc - one of the reasons they're still the best even in super advanced tryhard PvP is because of the way grenades work.
---
Basically, everybody will be using grenades. And despite being a hard CC which breaks on damage (what is typically an incapacitate effect), for whatever reason it's actually a special type of STUN that breaks on damage. As such, Orc resists a bunch of grenades, which makes their advantage even bigger in serious PvP!
---
&gt;My take, which I would like to be corrected on, is that orc is still clearly superior for hunters. 
---
Agree. Pet racial is nice too. 
---
&gt;Warrior: Tauren, with increased hitbox, 5% hp, and warstomp, is a very solid option for warrior. Is FAP play enough to push tauren over orc? This is the one i most wonder about as a possibility.
---
There's a few issues with warstomp. First it has a .5 second cast time. Secondly, it reset your swing timer (This is a huge deal with Warrior). Lastly it costs rage (!!!). If these weren't the case you'd probably be right, but Orc is still where it's at.
---
?​
---
Warlock: Undead's wotf is pretty strong, and other undead racials aren't useless. Will FAPs make undead supreme? Seems like one of the less likely ones when pvp trinket doesn't break stun (for when you are opened on)
---

---
Yeah I'd still go with orc here. 
---
&gt;Shaman: Tauren is a great option for shamans. You don't have other stuns, so war stomp is especially nice for them. I'm guessing orc is still superior for premade bgs though, war stomp is probably going to matter less for you in team fights where you are staying back?
---
Actually, for elemental, the general agreement is tauren is possibly better than orc (though if you plan on doing enhance, and god help you if you do, go orc). You can warstomp and then cast a spell in somebody's face directly afterward. You can warstomp while your fire nova totem is cooking and about to explode in their face. The cast time doesn't really matter because the enemy is coming to you, so you're sure to get a hit.
---
I farmed AV for about 4 weeks straight....just sat on a hill watching the fight as a paladin because if you die you don’t get honour from kills.
---
When I finally got unstoppable it felt amazing....for 3 days and then they released it so you could buy it with honour marks or gold I forget.
---
I’m still salty about it to this day.
---
Clearly priest is the best choice for this endeavor:
---
Crucio - Power Word Pain
---
Avada Kedavra - Power Word Death
---
Wingardium Leviosa - Levitate
---
Imperio - Mind Control
---
&gt; Do you want me cleaning or sitting at my PC wasting my time on the forums?
---
You are right, I should not waste my time listening to forum users like you.
---
Blizzard, open the beta!
