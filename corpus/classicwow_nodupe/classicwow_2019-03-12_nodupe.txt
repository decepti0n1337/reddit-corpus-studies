It is nice for anyone not maining a mage. Although hunters will be flooding Mara by the thousands. 
---
---
---
For me it comes down to Bg's are just a way for me to have fun. They aren't serious and I don't wanna wait to play one. It's okay if you feel differently but I don't wanna wait in a city for 30 minutes just to do a BG.
---
Orc BM/Survival melee hunter with a big fuck-off axe and a pet wolf. Become a legend. Rexxar approved.
---
If I roll a priest alt I'll likely take alchemy and herbs and be willing to help guildies. But I'm rolling meme spec ret for a main and need all the tryhard dps help I can get! 
---
Bad bot.
---
&gt; I honestly don't think so.
---

---
Flat earthers think silly things too. You can't win an argument over facts by announcing that you have a silly opinion.
---
&gt; You're being asked to provide your reasoning as to why you believe people are doing twice the DPS and you said because of private server numbers being off. It's literally common sense you back that up with the actual source for that.
---
I think you are just deliberately wasting my time now. But I'll explain it to you slowly.
---
In game called WoW, monster have "health". Monster not fall down until monster got no "health".
---
DPS make health go down.
---
Twice DPS make health go down twice fast.
---
Monster fall down three times fast.
---
How much DPS we do?
---
Mage do DPS by mash frost bolt. Mage DPS have no skill.
---
You say mage do three times DPS by mash frost bolt with much skill.
---
You not right.
---
&gt; bviously I can't precisely do the math and say "that adds up to twice the damage nowadays"
---
Yes. You can't. Nobody can. Even these supposed open source gurus who know everything about the code and how kosher it is.
---
Almost as if the people who know the most about the code know how much of it is guesswork or wrong.
---
&gt; You're too busy being the victim and screaming burden of proof.
---
That's a funny way of saying "calmly keeping the burden of proof on the person making the extraordinary claim with totally inadequate arguments".
---
&gt; If you actually had any proof of the numbers being wrong, you would've showed them already
---
Monster fall over three times fast.
---
You go look up what "proof" mean. It not mean what you think.
---
I remember when MC raids where 8 hours minimum, 12-14 on friday nights for full clear..good times
---
How much of a bigger time sink and gold grinding is needed to tank in raids compared to say a dps?
---
Talents and spell additions can arguably be considered content, and they are now stating it will emulate 1.2 at launch. My point is, you cant go off their original announcement when trying to figure out their plans. This new announcement we just received kind of breaks the mold on what we can say “We know.”

what exactly do you mean by walljumping please?
---
lol
---
&gt;Flat earthers think silly things too. You can't win an argument over facts by announcing that you have a silly opinion.
---
But he'll probably still back his statement of the earth being flat up, with whatever he believes to be proof.
---
&gt; Yes. You can't. Nobody can. Even these supposed open source gurus who know everything about the code and how kosher it is. 
---
The same way you can't back your statement up about the numbers being wrong.
---
So I take from this that you can't back that statement up at all and it was just thrown out there as a easy way to discredit someone comparing private server numbers to actual Vanilla.
---
So, all in all none of us can prove anything. Got it.
---
So you have server statistics to show is for the unreleased game? Where are you pulling the numbers for the pool of players being too big on blizzards servers for classic? Or are you just making up the numbers to make an argument?
---
Get an alt to hold all that random crap, it's making my OCD flare up.
---
I sooo can't wait until they release classic BFA
---

gonna be fucking amazing see u fellas there

100% gonna be me on a 2nd account while playing on main account.

[A little more granular data for you for r/classicwow!](https://i.imgur.com/OcuBwi6.png)
---
I agree with this guy. Queueing into premades is not fun and more specifically the same premade over and over.  
---
And you will say “ just make your own premade” or “get good scrub” but honestly if there becomes server imbalance and BGs become one-sided that would be far worse than adding battlegroups IMO.  
---
I can see why you would want server specific BGs but it likely won’t work without very high population which we already know isn’t happening. 
---
Two more plusses I can think of - no spirit regen interruption and more discreet mounting (no gfx/sound emission). Some may find BWL scroll trinket+mounting up useful, but has limited use to justify blowing a 5 min cd.
---
The bright aura surrounding the mount looks neat at night though.
---
I want both, but in which order is going to be dictated by whether or not riding skill is learned from the Charger quest. Saving a few hundred gold depending on the economy is pretty significant.
---
It might not be a problem at peak hours but for nocturnal al players it very possibly could. The whole debate is pretty pointless with no numbers.
---
Avoid any big streamer realm and you will be ok
---
Well as someone in another thread mentioned, a priest can go eng to be able to do DMN runs, but it’ll have to be a decision I make when I’m ready to drop Tailoring at end game I guess.
---
I agree. I love how drastically different a dungeon experience can be depending on what you end up with in your group. Case in point: I ran SFK with 2 mages and a priest. Our tank marked well and we had insane CC and breezed through it. Came back later with a different group composition and it was much harder. Similarly, I remember being well received on my enhancement shaman when I went to Maraudon in a group with a warrior and rogue, due to STR/WF/poison cleansing totem. I remember cheering whenever a mage joined the group because we got sheep and free water. 
---
You and tips are for sure just cashing out on the hype, Tips dosent even play vanilla and you got carried thru every raid you ever attended. You both have no original content, literally half of your guy's videos are a big facecam reading a blue forum post out loud or an epic "Top 10 CRAZY pvp items in Vanilla WoW" video. Always 10 minutes long, always have ads. So tired of you nerds trying to represent us 
---
Engineering really can help every class but I wont roll it on every class. I'm weird that I like having diffrent professions on any toon I make and maxing all of them. Even fishing and cooking!
---
Curses (except agony and weakness) are ALWAYS needed. You'll get corruption up, as long as it's cleared with your GL, and you'll slam shadow bolts until your number keys pop off.
---
Summer 2019 is when the hot pockets thaw, the mountain dew reaches perfect temperature and the neckbeards regrow.
---
That is really cool every time it ticks over 1000, im like hell yeh
---
Back in the day there was a trick you could do that let you climb normally impassible terrain. People used it to get to places like Ironforge Airport, Mount Hyjal, and to get the flag into impossible to get to locations in WSG.  
---
  
---
Nowadays the engine has changed and it is no longer possible to do this.
---
Progression raid your epic rotation is either curse of elemental/shadow SPAM bolt
---
Yeah. I don't mind not having post 1.10 items in, but I hope they just leave item stats in their final 1.12 state.
---
This is why I will never roll a cloth class in classic.
---
Yassss
---
Hah, same! I'm expecting us to hit 60,000 within 3 weeks, maybe a bit sooner, based on current rates. I'm expecting 75K by launch, but honestly, I could see upwards of 100K depending on how big the hype train is and how much Blizzard advertises the launch. We barely hit 30K before BlizzCon last year!
---
I agree with the Rogue/Druid/Hunter thing.
---
1. they are very good at engaging a target and disengaging.
---
2. They all have high skill ceilings when it comes to pvp so good players will get more value out of them. Druids are tricky in terms of fast decision making, Hunters can be mechanically intensive in terms of rythm and spacing, Rogues have to be on point with cooldown and risk management.
---
3. All of them are gear independand (Druid: Feral, Hunter: BM, Rogue: Prep/CB)
---
BUT in my personal opinion Shadow Priests are the strongest in terms of raw power. They don't have good tools to engage/disengage but when the fight happens they have the best tools to win any engagement.
---
Hunters are awesome. Nothing beats a good hunter raid leader pulling mobs and marking targets. I know how many times our hunters saved our raids from having to run back with jumper cables. And I can remember more than 1 %1 near wipe where all we had were 2 hunters still up to deliver a killing blow. 
---
ClassicDB seems to me better than Wowhead. I miss Thottbot.
---
"a truck can arguably be called a car" I believe he was referring specifically to content being the literal content in the sense of the word used by 99% of players, call it a colloquialism but his point was clear. Old talents sucked, 5 points or you had no arcane explosion and evocation takes a talent isnt fun imo. I didn't mean this post in a snarky way but his comment was not poorly worded and reddit has a way of adding nuance onto nuance onto nuance ad naseau.

Dwarf priest Opilol and gnome warlock opilolz. Was an officer in WiP by late 2014 I think.

Around 10 days of ingame time is a good average to hit 60 if i remember right.
---
I'm returning to this question, as the latest blue post shows evident knowledge by Blizzard of the 1.9 to 1.10 patch changes. How would they know that with 100% certainty \*without\* having found a way to reconstruct those databases? Are they actually using external sources for this?
---
It seems the most reliable to me. Most people swear by it too.
---
I will write in chat "all need" and then click need.
---
[removed]
---
They may have found a way to reconstruct the old database tables, because of how else can they confidently talk about 1.9 to 1.10 values in the latest update?
---
The question is if we can return to such a time at all. It’s hard to go back. I’m hopeful though.

If method didn't matter Mangala would be a hero and respected scientist.

Depends on how much of a casual you are, how many hours a day will you play and will it be every day consistently?
---
But Classic? Hell yea dude!
---
Grats, we did it :) they updated their Content Stage Release schedule from 4 to 6!
---
"The social interactions that everyone keeps crying about would never happen during the race to max level"
---
That's such bullshit its almost funny.
---
EU servers released feb 11th, 2005.
---
My first character was created Feb 17th, 2005.
---
I was ganking stonetalon at level 18 when I met 2 other rogues doing the same. They invited me to the group and a few hours of killing every ally that we would find in stonetalon I got invited to their guild.
---
Leveled with them to 60. Made a bunch of other friends in the guild that I still remember their character names 14 years later.
---
Learned to swear in Greek, learned how to stunlock and proper keybinds with those 2 rogues.
---
Sharding could have stopped me from ever meeting them were it a thing during release.
---
Think about the bullshit you guys spout as facts when making these posts 
---
Probably 3 hours a day almost every day, i mean i guess i would consider that casual for me lol.
---
I do wish people would stop including sharding in any list of things to be hated and fought against.
---
Yes sharding was not part of vanilla but blizz have said it will only be in at the start. I remember logging in for the first time into the dwarf starting area and it was chaos. Too many people chasing too few mobs and everybody getting pissed at having mobs tagged just before you could get to them, lagging to hell and back didn't help either, lol.
---
I never want to have to go through that again.
---
Would be nice if we got some sort of skin like this for Battle.net launcher when you select wow classic 
---
Let's hope they don't get fired too 🤔
---
They already said the debuff slots were due to technical limitations and not a design decision.  So they would be artificially limiting debuff slots for early patches just because that’s how it was back then. 
---
If that’s the case then they should also have old talent trees and game breaking bugs that were fixed later in Vanilla. 
---
I presume you will be playing on a 56k modem and CRT monitor as well? 
---
bind frostbolt to mouse wheel for raids
---
stop cast macro for poly/cs/iceblock/blink
---
If you prefer to bind shift so it downranks important spells like fireblast and cone of cold to rank 1 you can do that. It would macro frostbolt rank x and rank 1 and cast the rank1 whenever shift was held and rank x when not held down.
---
Recklessness is almost always used.

Was there ever "Welcoming Committees" like that?

Just another low effort repost.

Mootilda 👌🏻

Yeah, remember him =)

I've always wanted to play as a quillboar or gnoll. I love their ugly, hunchbacked shapes. Quillboar prot warrior and Gnoll hunter. I'd be all about it. I wouldn't ever play a Murloc but I'd be cool with the.
---
I like it. 
---
I ninja intellect gear on my warrior because I need it to spend less time grinding my weapon skills.
---
Afaik flame buffet would use the regular coefficient.  If those nades do fore damage then they should.

Idk.

2m CD with grenades. Just like invis pots puts other pots on CD. Grenades/sappers are on their own CD and do not share it with healthstone/root tubers/runes/mana gems.

Something like [clearing all of Faerlina’s trash at once](https://clips.twitch.tv/SpinelessFunnyWaterNinjaGrumpy)? Silencing bomb+bunch of sappers+AoE taunt+BoP on tank. 
---
And yet a core of my old RPG group is back together. Tons of friends got together to play on private Wow servers too.
---
The difference between retail Wow expansions and Classic is that Classic has a proven VASTLY superior retention rate as proven from private server metrics.
---
IF you get some old friends together who are actual fans of this specific genre, they have a statistical better chance of staying. There's at least that.
---
Great idea.
---
That’s not the problem. He hasn’t even finished buying bank space yet!
---
I did not play WoW when it first came out, but I AM excited for WoW Classic. I dont understand why is this such good news, though. Can someone explain?
---
All the player names look like they were generated by hitting the random button. 
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure it will take you roughly 3 months honestly
---
I don't really think that kind of community will ever exist again. The world of gaming in general has evolved so much in the last 15 years. Now, servers will have YouTube stars and all that. Can't imagine it returning to the old ways at all.
---
You had to hit revered to unlock Heroic.
---
Also no equipment in his rig from before 2005
---
I'm not that desperate. I didn't last a full 60 seconds before I gave up on the one video of his I did try to watch.
---
That is about right, if a player varies game play with dungeons and grinds a couple professions along the way. It could easily take longer if it's a new player not familiar to the Classic leveling path.
---
Record levels will likely be around 4 days played total if reflective of private server play. 
---
It's two patch cycles between BWL and MC.
---
It feels like I'm not growing in strength as I level up, which is basically the antithesis of an MMORPG.
---
BWL is P3.
---
That’s why moonfire is the best. Damage on cast and over time after that, and it doesn’t have projectile speed/flight time. 
---
Does that mean Levitate wont work then? :( That was something I looked forward to a lot damn....
---
I need alts for my alts.  So far, I have a 40 lock for summoning and tailor shuffle, a 40 that does the LW shuffle, and one that does my alchemy, and 4 bank alts, 3 that handle the mats/crafted goods for the professions and one for all-purpose AH.
---
No, they said the items ADDED after patch 1.10 (i.e. Diana's Pearl Necklace, Spellweaver's Turban) won't be in the game until AQ. The itemisation of gear that existed before then will still be in the state it was in 1.12.
---
So, Ban'Thok Sash will still be BiS for mages.
---
God I loved ZA, one of my all time favorites. 
---
Yes you can always wear the gear once you buy it regardless of your current rank.
---
Gotta lobotomize him and delete 99% of wow knowledge of the internet too.
---
Can't be vanilla if everyone either knows everything about the game or have easy access to all the information right
---
True. And I feel your pain since I PvE to PvP as well. Maybe till pvp system is intact focus on all your money making/alt leveling so that you’re all set for pvp once it drops. Hoping the pvp is introduced at 2nd phase of 6.
---
Spell additions are content just as much as items being added.  His point was clear but also kind of narrow sided. Using the first announcement we received as a backing was proof. I stated in the original post that I am well aware of what has been said. With the now open changes to their original plan, the announcement today sets a new precedent on what we can say “We know” according to the now outdated news. Almost everyone looked past that and saw it as an advocation for progressive talents and started quoting now outdated announcements. Reddit has a way of refusing to see things objectively and knit picking the wrong points.
---
**&lt;After Dark&gt; Alliance NA - PvE**
---
**Raid Time:** Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:00 AM CT (midnight) and Sunday 7:00 PM CT. **Subject to change upon discussion.**
---
**About:** &lt;After Dark&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild. It will be on a PvP server, because what is vanilla without PvP. It is open to everyone. English is the primary language. I am a busy adult that works 2nd shift. It has been hard to find a raiding guild on current WoW with my schedule. I'm sure a lot of you are in this same boat. This is our chance to experience Classic WoW, while still holding a second shift job. We may be few and far between, so we must come together as **night owls!**
---
**Goal:** My goal is to bring everyone together with a late night schedule. We will be able to **form dungeon groups, raid, and PvP, late at night.**
---
**Expectations:** I expect **you** to be somewhat respectful. But, if you do something **stupid,** you will get **flamed.** But, leave our mothers out of it. Or not. Oh yeah, we **will** be downing **Kel' Thuzad**.
---
**Extra Info:** I am not expecting to be the guild leader, but I can be. I will organize raids and other events, if so. I will promote a select number of **officers**. I do not have extreme Vanilla WoW knowledge, as I only hit level 30 in vanilla. I have played private servers and know the Molten Core mechanics. Again, it was hard to raid with my late night schedule. **If you have excessive Vanilla experience, or raiding leading experience in general, then DM me.**
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/fua5p6f
---
**Let's get it**
---
Looks like they have the AV mount so maybe they just got epic riding.  Also, I have most of my gold on a bank alt, because my main is not parked in a town 24/7.
---
Hey, are you planning on putting these up on a service to sell? :)
---
Don't worry about. Even after their damage falls off relative to other dps classes, guilds are going to want to bring three of them. 
---
Also depends on another definition of casual.
---
Those 3 hours per day, are they spent 100% leveling? Or an hour putzing around and 2 hours leveling? 50% leveling and 50% putz and fishing? Etc. There's different casuals.
---
Casual Player 1 might spend 160 hours leveling, casual here being non optimized leveling routes, just picking up quests and heading out and doing them.
---
@ 3 hours a day: Level 60 in 2 months
---
Casual Player 2 might level up in 120 hours. Casual here being 3 hours a day, but time spent most optimally with guides, routes, no froofery.
---
@ 3 hours a day: Level 60 in 1.5 months
---
Casual Player 2 might level up in 300 hours. Casual here being nonoptimized questing, leveling tailoring for shits and giggles, picking flowers cause you might do alchemy later, re-running dungeons you outlevel cause friends want to run them, etc.
---
@ 3 hours a day: 3.5 months.
---
I want sharding for starting  levels.  I have seen what 5 people can do to a section of the map I want to farm. Now multiply that by 1000.  No thanks...
---
The classic dev team is on our side. Do not attribute good things to those who had nothing to do with it.
---
Why would you account share anyway ? 
---
What is only for the US guys? I know it launched later in europe, but I'm a bit confused what your gripe is.
---
I was only on a single server too - Tichondrius. We even used consumables in world PvP, and the odd premade BG. I guess availability of reagents makes a difference. We would often have extended fishing trips, where 5 or 6 of us would all be out fishing in the same spot, just chatting, maybe having the odd drink.
---
I usually level 100% on the weekdays and do misc stuff on weekends
---
I would prefer instant respawns for quest objects, and dynamic spawns for mobs, to feeling like I'm not really on the server with all the other people that are supposed to be there.
---
Pve it's more complicated but for raids boring but basically every class is pretty boring for raids.
---
&gt;12g
---
Too real.
---
&gt; Around 10 or 11* days of ingame time is a good average to hit 60 if i remember right.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Edit : after digging around abit casual players giving it an hour or 2 most days say around 2 months
---
240 hours or 10 days /played @ an hour or two a day (1.5) is 5 months.
---
Playing on Australian internet no less: how bold.
---
Are there any decent builds for a leveling warrior that uses a shield but doesn't have much in the prot tree and instead focuses on damage? I found shields to be really good on my shaman and often eschewed the typical two hander for a mace  and shield when I was out and about. I've never played a warrior in vanilla and am not too familiar with their talents, but that definitely appeals to me.
---
I wouldnt survive the high warlord grind again at my age, so I hope so.. :) 
---
The early idea presented at BlizzCon had content being released at times it was not originally, and often in an odd order that would invalidate the content it was paired with. This new plan is much closer to the way it was originally.  
---
That’s it in a nutshell. 
---
I just copy pasted other people answers G /shrug
---
Fuck the haters, they are just idiots. You, and the rest of  the classicast guys are awesome people and give us a lot of content. I am very grateful we have you guys. I am looking very forward to seeing your content when classic releases.
---
And then WOTLK to finish it off :) Happy to see it stop there personally. 
---
well, the first thought that comes to my mind when seeing that, is "hey, Windows Vista!"
---
but, on the other hand, I have quite long memories running this launcher on Windows Vista. I even remember that trick to run this launcher after patch 3.1 (which changed it into the big one)
---
Anyway, this is definitely not Windows 8 or 10.
---
SAWBONES SHIRT. 
---
I cant wait to get it again.
---
Would love to buy a hd version to use as a wallpaper on my pc :)!
---
Really I didn’t know that but I’m glad to hear it. That takes off some pressure and spreads the magic around. Awesome shit 
---
Not everyone in the community wants to fight those things. We don’t even know exactly how they’ll be used.
---
Don't want to force my friends to play a game they are not into. Some guildmates from years ago got in contact with me. Will be 5-6 of us, I am pretty excited. Only downside is they want to play horde.
---
what about Elemental Invasions?
---
You're joking. After writing this I thought, hold on, Honored isn't that bad at all, why would I go through all of this questing effort and avoid Nagrand? I even remember going back at lvl 70 to do low level quests for rep. But I just posted anyway since I do remember going through all this effort.
---
Revered makes more sense. It took way longer to get into Heroics anyway since you needed good gear. I just don't remember struggling to get the key for anything other than Auchindoun and Coilfang, I think. And for Coilfang, I think most of my PTSD comes from farming rep to get that exalted druid weapon, which in my head is a hammer, but that's not possible. Best druid tanking weapon you could get at that stage anyway.
---
You missed the most important. The Classic Ghetto Hearth
---
Did you also cry during the original release of WoW that it wouldn't boot up on your Windows 95 machine that couldn't even run pinpall without completely freezing up? It's your own fault that you didn't save up for a new machine after 8 years my young paddawan, even worse is that you got a mac that isn't easy to upgrade.
---
That’s fair. I’m just excited for classic 
---
It was an old meme specifically for Blackrock because it had high pop due to being the home of a lot of both internet famous PVE and PVP players (ex: &lt;Nurfed&gt; and Reckful). It was also part of BG9 aka the US PVP BG.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Blackrock_US
---
This is pretty misleading. Most classes can't farm as well as you're making all-encompassing Person B out to be. Also, even if they DO have a spec that is fairly viable in farming as such, their ideal gear could be much harder to attain than other class' mix of Tier pieces and random blues/epics. Also the fact that they would likely have to respec multiple times a week to even farm like that would greatly cut into their margin between option A and B meaning instead of 5 hours they might have to do it 8 hours to make it be a net gain.
---
&gt;WOOT
---
Definitely 2005
---
But what New microtransctions will let get? That's what the people want
---
Lol that’s classy. But I was feeling more https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7QT7bhJTkAs
---
Did the trash in Scholo have a hire chance of dropping blues than mobs in any random zone? Is that a trait of all dungeon mobs?
---
I don't know why people think this. The moment Chinese gold farmers figured out DM:N Trib runs ALL of their characters disappeared from world farming. Vanilla players noticed that, especially on PvP servers where people made a point of pride of farming the farmers. Where did they go? Oh, look they are in DM all the time. I wonder what they are doing. Oh, hey, look at this, Mana Potions on the AH super cheap all the time all of a sudden. That is odd. I wonder where they came from. What can you do in DM that gets a ton of Mana Potions? 
---
I had a Chinese gold farmer who just mailed me Mana Potions directly from his runs. Basically supplied the entire guild with them. Everyone knew about solo Trib runs that Hunters could do. I concede initially the Chinese farmers were using a Z-axis hack but it got fixed and they kept doing it somehow, people figured it out.  
---
If you prefer spell power to attack power, you're a magic class
---
Wow...love it. I'm getting so excited for this!
---
I came
---
Let's be clear, regarding damage, you are gimping yourself a LOT by sword and boarding it. But you do take less damage, so better downtime, but still it is really not the best thing to do.
---
Having said that, I will be running a hybrid spec again, like I did in vanilla, but this time I will be stance-dancing from day one (or maybe day 5 when I get some stances) and usually will be using a 2-hander, then switching to shield when needed. 
---
Not sure what I'll do this time around, but leaning towards primarily Arms. There was an interesting guide I saw a while ago regarding levelling talents (ie which to choose in which order). I'll try and find the youtube video. It was focused around Fury 2-hand levelling, but I remember seeing it and thinking it was a really useful video because he explained why you would choose a talent at a specific level, before choosing another. So if you are unfamiliar with warrior, it gave a good grounding, and you could choose your own playstyle just from this knowledge.
---
Youtube is blocked at work, so I'll try to find tonight. 
---
Equip or Sell?
---
Shift modifier your regular frostbolt with the rank 1 version. 
---
Also was home to a great deal of the Oceanic population before we got our own servers.
---
How do the tanks survive that volley of shadow bolts at the first?
---
As someone who created a coalition of guilds to collectively farm Black Lotus in vanilla, they do not have a two hour respawn. It is an hour. A server, if they are farmed on CD, will produce 1,008 Black Lotuses per week. This is more than enough for multiple raid guilds that are actually trying, especially as you can stockpile them while content is on farm, with Blizz-like population caps. 
---
Nice! I have the one with the Night Elf cover and Dungeon Companion 2 (in addition to TBC dungeons and raids, up until Black Temple, it includes Naxxramas since it wasn't out when Dungeon Companion 1 was made.) Bought Dungeon Companion 1 used off amazon the other day. Can't wait for it to get here.
---
Nice! I’ll have to grab the other dungeon companion and the night elf version
---
of course they'll be banned for account sharing if it's proven, the normal ToS still aplies.
---
Not the new models, you are however able to set your standard options a good bit higher. But old games aren't necessarily visually worse, just a little tad less polished and sometimes a bit rough on the edges. 
---
The current WoW is too polished and if you can't live without it, I am not sure if Classic will be the game for you.
---
I really have this feeling that legendary weapons drop more on private servers than they should. I base this feeling purely on how few I saw in vanilla and watching a couple videos of private servers going "wow, 2 people with Thunderfury? Bullshit!" and not on anything worth listening to, but I still wouldn't be surprised.
---
My standard activity called "being bored":
---
1. Jumping around in the weirdest places, trying to get to places such as rooftops. Once I get there, I try to get as close to the edge as possible, without falling. One day, I'll try that IRL...
---
2. RPing around without actually RPing - like, walking towards random NPC, greeting them and asking how is their day going or saying that I haven't seen them for ages
---
3. Switching to walk animation and following the children sightseeing in Stormwind - do you know that they actually go in circles?
---
And you know what? The demo brought it back. I started doing such things, when I was bored. No, it was not because we were different, or because there were not enough games to play. This feeling CAN BE recreated!
---
For paladins it’s around 650ish roughly
---
Plus maybe unpopular for paladins but I prefer the normal horses, not just for looks but having it be a spell and cost mana gimps you a little. 
---
Curse of demons lol and you know mages don’t give a fuck
---
My master plan to grind dire maul 53 to 60 is now ruined :(
---
So there's a chance!?!??!
---
https://youtu.be/6gpXmzYkUCo&amp;t=2:40 is it the video talked about here?
---
curse of elements/shadow and you will spam shadowbolts. The thing that makes them weaker than mages is that Shadowbolt has no threat reduction whereas Frostbolt does. If you crit a couple times in a row with Shadowbolt you are liable to pull the boss, so Warlocks will have to sit there doing nothing to wait for their threat to reduce sometimes.
---
I think i had that atlas..... maybe..... i had one hard cover wow guide, but for some reason the colors to separate the faction flight paths had their colors opposite of what they were suppose to label.
---
That's so funny because I ran with "the pvp premade" on my server, we had all the eventual R14s in there, I was on my way to R14 but I had to quit the grind for IRL reasons. Anyway we were serious, the best of the best, and were up against the best of the best players.
---
And.... people rarely used Engineering!!! Can you believe that? That's how noob we were. If someone popped a potion in a BG, like a FAP, I remember thinking they were some sort of monopoly man rich god. lmao...
---
I suppose there was a huge difference in culture from server to server. I know for a fact my server wasn't one of the 'highest end' servers in the sense of progression, and of course I absolutely enjoyed it and loved it. Each server is it's own universe (in Vanilla).
---
We didn't feel like noobs because we were the best of the best... in our universe.
---
I do guess people will use much more FAPs and wbuffs and consumes, etc, in Classic.
---
I've never in my 15 years of playing WoW had any problem getting into a raiding guild, angry child. 
---
You'll fit right in with the WoW community then. 
---
I want sharding, especially at lower levels. I don't want it in cities or later zones.
---
I will release a load immediately after looting it.
---
Bfa kid? Who are you talking to?
---
Auch was 3/4 Lower City and maybe Consotrium for Mana Tombs? Or MT was just Lower City as well. Tempest Keep was Sha'tar rep. 
---
You have the Night Elf one it seems. On the left under the Atlas :)
---
It’s not as big as the other for some reason. So I was confused haha
---
So what happens at the end of this?  Do they just reset it and give us classic phase 1 again, or do we go into burning crusade and on from there? 
---
You buy a regular mount or wait for DM to be released.
---
thats kinda awesome
---
I so badly want this! My plans to play a rogue and wpvp as much as I can will come true if so!
---
Because it's a bit more complicated than that. They kept the option to keep showing the older faces and the likes, but they changed the bone structure so it was still different. The updated models work with different bones and aren't compatible with the original skeleton and vice versa, that includes things like the faces. 
---
It wouldn't be so controversial if the change wouldn't take away the option to play the game as it was originally and didn't change the gameplay, feeling and flow of the game (hitboxes actually differ, spell animation is different with the newer skeleton etc)
---
Tldr; You can't change one and not the other. 
---
I'm happy to argue! We're just trying to figure things out after all.
---
I glossed over the video yet again, and I don't see the part about buff stacking like you're suggesting. It has always been the case that some buffs stack and some buffs don't. There may be a few differences here and there in either direction. But nothing significant.
---
Ony head (and rend head) are on a "cooldown" which he mentions, and that will indeed change things. It will just take a lot more server wide coordination to consistently take advantage of those buffs.
---
&gt;titans will not be readily available to your average guild.
---
Probably so. The smart people will even hoard a lot of BLs for tier 2 content since you can easily clear MC without flasks. BWL is when you really start benefiting from the stat boosts.
---
Really the only absolute must have in MC (aside from class specific things like mana pots etc) is Greater Fire Protection Potion for Rag. Flasks would be overkill imo and I would advocate hoarding BLs in the guild bank, at least a portion of them if not all.
---
I had Retrimootion locked prior to taurens being able to be paladins
---
And where tf did you pull that 20-30% figure from, since there have been literally dozens of 'which class will you play' polls on this sub and the highest figure I've seen was like 17%...
---
Ah that fog. Basically all our crappy computers made the instances and zones feel so much larger, because of that fog. I like the aesthetic of it better with it than without.
---
Agreed. I'm very glad they decided to remove sharding.
---
&gt;unnerffed content way harder then I think some are expecting.
---
If I had to guess, probably Classic will be harder than pservers, but we can't be sure yet. And it may vary on a case by case basis. For all we know it might be easier, can't know yet. Armor debuff stacking is a big deal though, and it's still arguably up in the air.
---
Yup. Came to terms with the fact that I'll likely never get my Paladin mount today cause of the same thing. Gonna be a human on a cat for me.
---
Exactly, people need to understand that hunters are not a pure dps but a utility class that is actually one of the most essential classes in the game, good luck clearing without them. They are not meant to too the meters
---
I would prefer a week of hectic fun, than a Retail-esque "normalized" experience. If someone says "Hey, come check out the 50 naked Night Elves in Goldshire!" I want them to actually be there when I go look.
---
There was literally zero evidence blizzard wasn't listening to the community...
---
&gt;I miss having to CC mobs and knowing your toon well enough to be able to control your CC aswell as dps what the tank was focusing on.
---
You still do all this on retail in mythic+
---
Does he even have time to loot those boots?  Looks like he's got mail...might be urgent.
---
No armour epic mounts hype
---
TIL there is WoW classic. Since I missed out back in the OG days, and I didn't find the new stuff enjoyable when I gave it a try, would this be worth trying out?
---
There was literally zero evidence that blizzard wasn't listening to the community.  In fact there was a ton of evidence from the SC:R classic dev team showing how faithful they were to every community demand.
---
Pallies invis pot—&gt;bubble to pull all of them, then a rogue or someone comes in with an Arcanite Bomb to silence them. Then a warrior comes in and gets bopped+pops Challenging Shout. The tank is immune to melee but mobs are forced to hit him for the duration of CS. The raid then comes in with sappers and clears the packs in a second. 
---
That is 100% further away from classic than sharding in starter zones.
---
Dynamic spawns is way worse than sharding.
---
Woah! A real life Wrath baby. How ya do'n little fella? Ya excited to see the world of Vanilla?
---
While I agree that class identity was fantastic in Vanilla, there were still some issues in that many classes were stuck with only one viable end game spec. 
---
&gt;feral druid tank and a holy paladin healer
---
There were no feral druid tanks in the end game. Paladins could ONLY heal and buff despite supposedly being Warriors of light.
---
Class identity is garbage in retail, but there are still significant differences in party compositions when running high mythic+
---
damn! what about the regular mount? will it still be available?
---
I just had a thought, are they going to do anything with the Wow TCG cards? Maybe re-release them for classic? 
---
Hard to say without knowing server statistics or when you will be leveling. The longer it takes you the less safe contested zones will be. Redridge is definitely safer from ganks.
---
Got to r9 on a pserver playing 4 hours a day solo queue pretty much the whole time. I feel like r11 should be achievable at the same place.
---
Sure but blizzard designed encounters with these limitations in mind and without them some encounters may be too easy.
---
&gt; Let's get an incentive system for world pvp immediately
---
If your incentive isn't tears, you'll never make it.
---
I used to use swiftness pots like they were going out of style, but that is because I had oodles of mats (i spent a lot of downtime gathering, just a really relaxing pastime for me). Engineering was the big ? for me. I was never interested in it, never used it - just seemed like a lot of effort for little benefit, especially the backfires. 
---
Like you,I rarely ever saw engineers, very rarely saw anyone use charges or grenades or any of that stuff. And yet now, people say it is "mandatory" to have if you are a tank or a pvper. We managed alright back in the day, I think we'll manage alright now.
---
I might get outclassed in pvp nowadays, but that will be due more to my slower reactions and lack of practice than it will to someone using a grenade.
---
I never even thought twice about making sure all my mates had pots and elixirs before a BG. I didn't care if they lasted five minutes, I had heaps of mats and just made more. I never did much on the AH back then, so kind of hoarded everything. I guess the engineers had a different mindset.
---
We will have to see how the economy plays out in classic, see what people will be willing to part with and utilise in day-to-day activities. Some people think classic is all thought out, a foregone conclusion. I think we are going to be surprised what really does develop. Even in vanilla our experiences varied so much between servers, and population was a BIG deal.
---
Love to hear other people's experiences from back then, makes me realise just how many different ways there are to do things in WoW (at least back then).
---
You get it from the trainer. Easy peasy.
---
The level 40 mount (60%) will be available.. only the epic level 60 (100%) will not be due to the quest involving you go to Dire Maul
---
I guess I agree, we should just let cross realm BGs be 6-7 servers instead of the 2-3 I suggested, that way there's no hope of remembering anyone in the slightest.  
---
but which version of AV? that is the most important question imo
---
Because before guild banks were implemented, raid guilds had bank accounts that all the officers had access to.
---
The benefit of Engineering in raids and in PvP cannot be understated. It is absolutely massive.
---
That being said, people can and will manage without it. But the top guilds and top PvPers will (defacto) be taking advantage of Engi.
---
It's not progressive itemisation, which implies having an item with the stats it had during that patch. It's just not including the items CREATED after patch 1.10.
---
Hunter and warrior have okayish rotations.  
---
My gnome is still rocking that baby.  
---
Absolutely a huge feeling of nostalgia will hit those returning. The good news is the game is as good as remember.
---
But, also a massive portion of the viewers here have also played basically the same game over 3+ years. We know the new game play meta that is Classic is well worth learning whilst the feeling of nostalgia vanishes. ;)
---
Which two pieces?
---
I don’t think this sub is a large enough control group lol
---
It wouldnt be like private servers with people farming the same mob over and over. Your fears, and preconceptions may keep you from imagining a better solution.
---
&gt;  it really struck me how Tanks and Healers are carrying the group content, not DPS in even the slightest.
---
This is why it was so infuriating in the Vanilla/TBC days for warriors to refuse to tank in dungeons. Sure I can bear tank and the warrior can dps, but he brings absolutely nothing else to the table except dps. The group runs better if the warrior tanks and the druid dps's, because then the druid is available to CC beasts, off-heal or off-tank in a pinch.
---
I think one time I was tanking with a dps warrior and he rolled on dps leather. That was the last time.
---
https://i.imgur.com/HMrkEno.png  
---
Bottom right quadrant is the number of real time days it would take to hit 60 based on the numbers you select in the other axes.  
---
The problem with trying to calculate in game time required is that it depends how much you play a day. The less you play each day, the more of your leveling is done with rested xp. 
---
I know, I know. I've heard all that. It just isn't sinking in.
---
I think I will have to experience it before the light bulb, that everyone has been polishing, will go off.
---
All on me.
---
Not able to be carried around, but the Booty Bay teleporter to Gnomeregan is a teleporter 
---
 
---
there will be more people than mobs. 
---
I am excited to see if there is another gate opening event for the black AQ mount.  
---
Every single one a legend from birth. 
---
Shaman tank ftw
---
Sharding is not the solution.
---
When you start having to do mental gymnastics it loses its' charm. 
---
Well, it is about to be spring in the US and Blizzard did say classic will be coming in the summer. We just have this last season to go, right? Heh
---
The incentive *is* the PVP. Lowbies don't benefit from low level PVP outside of getting an early lead in ranking and potentially saving 10g on their lvl 40 mount.
---
What they've stated they are doing currently really doesn't change that much.
---
If you look at the pre-BiS lists for most classes, few items were added after patch 1.10, so people will still be in the same gear that has 1.12 stat values.
---
The honor system should be in the game at launch, imo. But they should hold back on having the epic set until BWL is released.
---
DM will be buffed so it may or may not reign after release.
---
Worriseome numbers- 56 thousands instead of millions
---
&gt;  people easily grind out the PvP mounts too easily 
---
Yes, because as we all know farming R11 for the mount takes less time than farming 1k gold for 100% mount. /s
---
Damn those pvpers devaluing my epic mount by getting a free one for 3x the time investment.
---
You can only loot trade with someone who was in the group at the time of the drop.
---
If your mate wanted the chest, they should just roll for it or request it from the master looter. In your example, you don’t need to be involved at all.
---
It did persist through death until 1.11. had to Google it as it does so on the private server I'm on atm. So guess it won't on classic.
---
GUILD DRAMA
---
They aren't doing stat updates on gear, i.e. Progressive Itemisation. They're just removing items that didn't exist before patch 1.10.
---
I’m a simple man. I see a classic wow post, and I upvote 
---
I played Kurtcowbain back in the day.
---
Shaman - Astral Recall
---
if they allow TCG loot you can get a mini dark portal that acts like a DK deathgate hearthstone. 
---
We're all gonna make it fam.
---
Dude it legit took me 2 weeks playing 4 hours a night to get to level 30... shit is gonna take people awhile, I played vanilla and it took me 8 months to get to level 54. 
---
There is low level PvP gear that can be obtain thru the bg quartermasters.
---
The thing is I hate grinding IRL, but I don't mind in WoW. Why can't RL be more like WoW?
---
&gt;UI design is not a nebulous concept.
---
It is not. Yet a part of UI design is sometimes fitting in decoration and aesthetically pleasing designs (as well as functional). Not every single part of every good UI design has purpose. Particularly common when the UI is created for a non-business environment, and even largely artistic medium. 
---
If you like minimalist UI design, that's fine again. It's doesn't make any UI design that goes against minimalism objectively "bad."
---
Most people will never get there epic mounts believe it or not. And the point of the epic mounts was that they are unique and sought after - allowing people to easily grind to get then will diminish the value.
---
You'll be going all over the place.  
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level
---
That's a rough design of each zone and their appropriate levels. More detailed guides exist out there.  
---
&gt;The problems die out in less than a week
---
Cool. Then wait a week until sharding's turned off. Then engage in weird shit in Goldshire to your heart's content.
---
&gt;Not a normalized "cater to everyone" type of experience.
---
But cater to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
---
Yeah I’m forgetting it was like 10 days played to 60. 240 hours just for that
---
But at max level, it’s not a mandatory time sink to keep up 
---
I think if they start TBC it will be a separate set of servers and you’ll re-roll.  Some people hated tbc.  And you can milk subs this way.  Like EQ prog servers.  You can make all sorts of servers with different eras and rulesets
---
That is actually true. Then again, both are equally addicting, so it's still ruining the kid's prospects.
---
Blizz doesn't have to adapt to pservers just because people are used to something, and they most likely won't.
---
I want to discuss alternate options, not be told by some idiot to just not play.  You are not adding anything to the conversation.  
---
I'm not asking for my own wants to be catered to. I'm trying to prevent unnatural changes to the game.
---
What patch was weapon normalisation? Will slow weapons be king?
---
&gt;We know the new game play meta that is Classic is well worth learning whilst the feeling of nostalgia vanishes
---
From my private server experience, the community was less meta-oriented than on actual vanilla
---
agreed
---
Yah people that are try hards and get to 60 hella fast are the ones impacted most.  You wont be able to rush to dire maul and farm gold and bis blues before guilds even start clearing MC
---
In Orgrimmar you have to run around the top of the bank building and land on each roof beam. If you land on any of the shingles in the middle you failed. Eventually your skilled will be honed to hexagonal precision the likes of which you never knew you were capable.  
---
Final Countdown was made after FMG got overpopulated and went to shit. Your character name sounds familiar but I could be wrong. I was Ewadizzle, one of like 4 Troll Rogues on the server. 
---
Nothing says world pvp like dishonorable kills.
---
Sign me up!!
---
It was a thing*  
---
Evasion mechanics changed later on in a way that made it impossible. The same evasion behavior is very likely to carry over into Classic making it impossible. But I will *sure* test it.  
---
Classic shithead response.  
---
"Well then just dont play if you dont like it."
---
Stating my preference is not the same as begging/demanding to be catered to, asshole.
---
&gt; I'm trying to prevent unnatural changes to the game.
---
- I would prefer dynamic mob respawns, and instant respawns on quest objects
---
- How many private server launches have we had?
---
Trying to prevent unnatural changes. Suggests private server changes, speak about how private servers did it better.
---
Edit: I responded to our now deleted comment.
---
Just make sure you paid for the commercial license ;) be nice to the good people over at [https://inkarnate.com/](https://inkarnate.com/) who work very hard to make a very nice service
---
Yeah, I am also afraid of hella lag.  People choose servers for fickle reasons, name sounds cool, its the first one, its the last one, etc.  I don’t want to wind up on a server that runs at 1 frame.  Seriously, no one makes a game with the intent of shit performance.  
---
Is it a joke about ret pallys being useless in early raid content and thus never getting their gear?
---
You didnt keep the title, you only got your highest achieved rank back when TBC 2.0 patch hit and they removed the honor system.
---
Horde guilds tend bring fewer hunters than Alliance, so if you're looking to get the set roll horde. Further more, due to how hunters gear progression goes. Guilds will want to gear up one hunter to 8/8, then the second, then the third etc.
---
IDK if stupid or what. You just told me not to play. I replied with your words in quotes to display how rude they are. I never said you shouldn't play.
---
I downvoted you because you are factually wrong :b
---
This isn't really an issue with no sharding and no shared quest items/vanilla respawns because there'd be no point talking to an NPC anyway.
---
&gt;And how did this bother you ? Was it particularly fun to outlevel a zone back in the day ? Yay mobs got green and give less XP ?
---
Yes it was actually. Because leveling to 60 takes as long as it does then finally getting out of a zone you have been in for a long time feels like a great accomplishment. Particularly notable would be doing the final parts of STV at 45+ after you spent the last fifteen levels since 30 going back there over and over.
---
Ah, yeah, I misunderstood.  I was just thinking of the character info page where it said "Highest achieved rank".  Wasn't thinking about actually displaying the title like "Knight-Captain Attrm" or whatever.  I always hid that title anyway.
---
&gt; there'd be no point talking to an NPC anyway
---
How do you get your quests and hand them in if you don't talk to an NPC?
---
this needed a video because none of us can read.

---
Hahaha, even kiting the innkeeper to the bank in Orgrimmar would be nice. Probably too hard to communicate in classic with the faction lock, but that would be great.
---
I'd rather have cross-realm Battlegrounds because I think I think PVP Community is more about world PVP then Battlegrounds when it came to Classic and since the Realms won't be crossing over in the world like they do now it's where most of the rivalries will show up I think
---
When I played classic I was in a PVP Guild for a while and I remember Battlegrounds were just for Honor farming and we had all our fun out in the world
---
Yes, yes, yes.  But none of you are telling Blizzard what they want to **Hear!!** 
---
pfffffffff
---
 "Yeah, hey Blizz, my mom's credit card number is 332....."
---
You stated that by farming the mats for flasks and other consumables people are loosing money for not being "the most efficient" with their farming. You also ignore the markup for buying flasks vs how much easier it is to farm the mats yourself in your math. Look, I get it, you want people to do the most and be the best at what you say is the "most beneficial" based on the choices.  
---
hey man! Sodapoppin is cool. He doesn't play retail trash like all these other guys who say they hate it but continue to stream it.
---
people who are fond of a game released in 2004 are children and cant afford to pay for things?
---
thats the joke right?
---
Until BWL is released, pvp gear is way more powerful than raid gear. If the honor system is released right away, the people who grind rank 14 will have huge advantages over every other player until BWL has been out for a while. Before someone suggests it, yes, players who put the time in to get rank 14 do deserve an advantage over people who don’t, but that gap is too wide with an initial release. 
---
Thank you Classic WoW team indeed. Maybe the entirety of Blizzard and Activision can learn a thing or two on how to treat their customers? Sometimes customers don't [ask for a better horse](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Henry_Ford#%22If_I%E2%80%99d_asked_people_what_they_wanted,_they_would_have_asked_for_a_better_horse%22), but just know what they want.
---
Sawbones shirt! Best in slot
---
Can confirm those are great episodes.
---
Also really liked the one with Nano from Nostalrius who was part of the group who Blizz paid to fly out to their HQ and discuss the earliest forms of classic.

What do you suggest?
---
is Blizzard or WOW Classic going there?
---
Blizzard should be there. This is what I’ve heard from a lot of BFA streamers.

Nah, Just thought it would be funnier that way.  But you make an interesting point, didn't consider the implications of the passage of time.

i wonder if Blizz just copy pastas Esfand ideas

Oooooooooo

Reported for reporting wow

You mean the reputation rewards that weren't in the game until 1.7 for AB rewards and 1.8 for WSG rewards?
---
The items that were added *after* the honor system was added?

Those stats are so fucking weird. Is it meant for DPS or prot warriors? Both? Neither?

I have it on my main dudes still too.

Don't mess up PvP rewards. No one wants to  see half the server running around in Grand marshal gear. 
---
Hi, /u/ithilras
---
when the only blizzard games you are hyped for are their old games like vanilla wow, warcraft 3 remake. Just goes to show they can't make anything original that is good anymore.
---
&gt;you got carried thru every raid you ever attended. 
---
He literally raid lead up through AQ40? Like, his entire guild was basically created for his raid team that was getting shafted in his old guild much before his twitch days? Also, to the no original content? Literally did the first ever Q1 stock earnings report stream based around an entire meme, like wtf? Also, dont pretend you arent a nerd either, its not a matter of them trying to represent you or anyone else, they just speak out loud for people to hear. If you dont like their opinions on stuff, make your own content contradicting it, speak out loud yourself. No one is claiming they represent anyone. They wanted their voices heard so they made content to do it. You want your voice heard, figure out a way to do it, dont just complain that others are doing it instead.
---
Please. It takes at least 3 to 5 times more time grinding BGs for R11 than it takes to get 1k gold and buy the damn thing.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about if you think R11 mounts are something "people easily grind", though that wasn't hard to see from your other posts in this thread.
---
If DM AE runs get nerfed, will mages still be the best farmers?  If not, who will be the next best?
---
I would play it till wrath.
---
Who cares if this was Wrath, the fact that he found this is amazing lol
---
Changing it so NPC's aren't restricted to a single player interaction.
---
If the choice was between sharding and adjusting NPC interaction and dynamic node spawn/drop rates for quest items I would rather have the latter.
---
If it were a choice between one or the other and no exceptions.
---
Blizzard already shared their thoughts on this. It would essentially make certain specs like shadow priest unable to perform in raids. 
---
Actually accurate
---
Wrong.
---
They're not added items CREATED after 1.10, like Diana's Pearl Necklace, Spellweaver's Turban, etc. As it stands, all other items will have 1.12 stat values.
---
This is fucking stupid. So we have to be content on boring MC for a long ass time? Have to use shitty itemization until  ZG and DM?    Classes that were fucked over by Tigole  needed those items to viable in end game. 
---
Sorry for the quality of screenshot and quality of paint edits, it's actually an edited screenshot of an edited screenshot, so you can't expect much.
---
Sure there's always gonna be people who shit on it, but there's A LOT of positivity towards classic there too. Read the top comments from the stagger announcement.
---
Gathering professions until 60 for pure profit, THEN once at 60 decide if you want to invest time to level a 2nd profession or whether you'd rather just grind. 
---
Some professions offer BOP stuff to boost your character's strength as well such as engineering or blacksmithing.  
---
As a rank13 since 2005 player I don't remember that at all. My experiences were all the pvpers were inside of bgs and it's how I made all my friends and we made groups to play with and enemies to play against.
---
Whattup Esfand - dont listen to the haters haha theyre just jealous gatekeepers like that other guy said.
---
I remember hearing about you back on Lightbringer when you were in raid 3 and now im a huge fan of classiccast years later. Not sure why everyone hates on video format - personally I love having the videos as a supplement to the text articles because I get to keep up with fresh off the presses wow news while im in my car on the commute home. Literally did just that today. Keep it up man, love your content!
---
Loot trading should have been there from the very start.
---
It's a harmless addition and a huge QOL improvement.
---
Unless you're planning to scam people as was the case before loot trading was enabled I don't see why you'd have to get worked up over it.
---
That's right. I was not part of FMG, I was an officer (15 years old lol) in LoD thru Rag/Ony and into early BWL with them. Guild began fragmenting, and some of us went to Final Countdown who was recruiting a handful of fringe raiders. My IRL friend Gladewolf (troll priest, probably don't know) and out MT Rektar (might know him, got thunderfury) joined with me
---
did your mom let you?
---
For EU players, Maraudon was part of the launch experience. Since the game launched in EU after the Maraudon patch.
---
Oh god, and I still am questioning my class choice. 
---
will there be any stream?
---
China bots used to farm Tyrs Hand but I have no idea just how viable that was.
---
From PAX East? I’m not sure. 
---
This information is classified for fear of stealing my names. :D
---
Clearly, you're not good at math and trying to insult someone else.
---
Phase 1 releases: 4-6 months (has Molten Core)
---
Phase 2 releases: 4-6 months (has no additional raid content except world bosses)
---
Phase 3 releases: Taking approximately 8-12 months to see BWL.
---
&gt; but he came out of nowhere (at least for me) asking for support and crying the blues
---
yeah that was true for alot of people. It was super bad timing. He had just started getting some traction on his videos after having been making them for a few months to that point when he lost his job. It was kind of a tipping point (no pun intended) for his to either find a new job and grind away at establishing a rapport at a new company and put youtube on the back burner or go all in for the content. His community he had around him convinced him to dive headfirst in because they liked his content that much. Dude went for it but hes got himself and his wife to support in a very expensive part of the country. So to the new viewer it seemed like he was just begging for cash/financial support out of nowhere while the older viewers were pushing for more content and streaming. Kind of a damned if you do, damned if you dont situation. really sucked.
---
The fact that they already know the phase 1 date.
---
And the fact that it feels as if they're already polishing it.
---
Which is the entire point, since giving warlocks an extra 15% damage is pretty huge.
---
personal loot didn't exist in vanilla. Do you even know how loot worked back then?
---
&gt; How can you be passionate about something you haven’t even experienced lmao?
---
Im super passionate about space but will probably never go there. I am super passionate about classic but Ive only every played private server classic. Im looking forward to classic just as much as anyone else here. Weve all seen the videos, heard the stories, read the forum posts of years past, we are ALL super excited for it but just because I havent played really vanilla, that makes me less passionate about it? Seems a bit of a false accusation to make.
---
I hope they allow enough time for people to actually gear up and run each gate of content and that it wont be something that only diehard neck beards end up doing before the next release comes.
---
Agi gives dodge, so... Prot?
---
What's wrong with right click reporting?
---
&gt; anor has changed wtf lol, why would you dislike someone for going fulltime with it and making more content for the people who watch it to enjoy. It's not like I gate anything I do behind a paywall, 
---
Hey Esfand, sorry if if there was some confusion but I was referring to Tipsout. I don't follow you actively but from what I have watched of you, seems like you're a passionate player invested in the community. Good luck out there. 
---
it isnt harmless. It incentivises screwing over outsiders to help your friends. 
---
Yeah back then we used this cool thing called TeamSpeak.  
---
Only if they roll out with the original pre-upgrade rewards, which I suspect they won't do. If we get the patch 1.11 version of PvP gear right from the start, it's so obscenely gamebreaking that the whole community will be consumed by discussions about it. Even the pre-upgrade R12+ rewards are a bit broken if available as soon as people can reach those ranks, which they will in just a few months, but at least T1 is good enough to compete with it. What we absolutely do not want is a situation where PvP becomes "you either have the 12h+ hours a day to grind for the top ranks or you cannot compete." On the private servers that had the upgraded rewards from the start, that was pretty much the case.
---
To those who don't know what I mean: PvP gear was upgraded very late in vanilla. Both the blue and epic sets received new stats and became way better. The blue set became on par with T1 and the epic set became on par with AQ40-level gear.
---
[Example](https://i.imgur.com/3wDLwZa.jpg)
---
I get the point youre making and I think you could take it even furthr haha
---
some people literally DONT even play the sport they love, never have or never could. How many huge fatass basketball fans are there that couldnt jump off the ground to save their lives lol doesnt mean they dont know every single stat of every single player of all time etc etc
---
Another good example is coaches.. if you think Bill Belicheck can actually perform/play half as good as even the worst bench rider in the nfl youre crazy. But of course his knowledge of things is god tier, he doesnt have to actively play or have ever played to be able to study and absorb info.
---
In light of this is crazy to think someone who played to lvl 38 ish on retail and then also played private servers is "too inexperienced" lol. those haters should go be the "voice of the community" then if they are oh-so-educated and perfect candidates themselves.
---
In fact I would argue people who played privates are even more knowledgeable than those who only played retail since retail knowledge is minimum 13-14 years old now and questionable at best even if you were that "hardcore rank 14 full clear naxx" kind of person everyone on this sub is lol its really just a sad attempt at gatekeeping IMO when people hate on tips

Just farming the first boss and dogs as a mage is an easy 100g a day (sometimes per hour). As much as a love this farm, the gold farmers will kill the economy if they don't do something about it. Hopefully p-servers just had some things wrong.
---
Dude I bet at most like, absolute maximum only 1/3 of WoW Classic players use Reddit. So that's still an easy peazy 150k+ subs and that aint bad at all.
---
Hunters are the best farmers with DM:T 150g/h.
---
Maybe it's different now but I tend to recall that PVE servers h.ad more alliance than PVP servers. RP servers also had more alliance from memory.
---
*Heaven is always just over the horizon..*
---
Or they could just idk tune the fights around 16 debuffs? That would solve both problems. 
---
Well we'll just have to agree to disagree then because that wasn't my experience and I got to rank 12 we would go out and gank and start World PvP with rival guilds and it was a lot more interesting than running Battlegrounds over and over
---
Just this sub because it’s different than all of reddit
---
They shared their thoughts on the release calendar and those views were modified. Personally the 8 debuff limit isn't a hill I'll die on, but the reasoning "it would essentially make certain specs like shadow priest unable to perform in raids" really rubs me the wrong way.
---
But this would effect the game, purely because people wouldn't actively looking for others and making it feel like a community of players, calling out for help. Why are people so insistent on trying to take this away? You're only damaging it for your self.  I mean, I'm sure something like it will happen, and I've a feeling it'll happen whether we like it or not, it's just something to consider. The true base of "Classic" WoW, is the community, coming together, bumping into one another, randomly grouping, and making friends, not just a quick invite from some system. The randomness is part of it, surely? That's the adventure? I suppose LFG is still 'random' but... ya know?  
---
It is amazing that people have set up these non-official bots in Discord though, that's pretty god damn smart. 
---
It’s a win/win. We get a more progressive content release that doesn’t immediately trivialize content and ruin immersion, and blizz gets at least another few rock solid months of subscriptions.
---
My spriest was named Flay mignon.
---
No Mookake then?
---
Is honor going to be in the game at launch?
---
The content schedule doesn't mention honor at all.
---
No. She doesn’t know
---
&gt; The day honor and ranks came out in vanilla
---
Which patch was that?  When do we get to see it again?!
---
With 16 debuff slots, locks can use Corruption, I believe.
---
Important Debuffs:
---
Sunder Armor
---
Curse of Recklessness
---
Faerie Fire
---
Annihilator debuff 
---
Gift of Arthas
---
Curse of Elements
---
Curse of Shadow
---
Shadow Weaving
---
Winter's Chill / Improved Scorch
---
Nightfall
---
Improved Shadowbolt
---
Ignite
---
&gt; absolute maximum only 1/3 of WoW Classic players use Reddit
---
Still not any close to that 12 millions!
---
Can you explain me how having shards the size of regular amount of people in starting zone will massively make the classic experience suck? Wouldn't that be the "blizzlike" lvling experience as opposed to having the zone overpopulated while everyone and their mother is trying to do the first quests?
---
Sure, and that's what I'd personally prefer: For Blizz to rebalance raid encounters based on the talents and gear available.
---
However, if you suggest it, you'll get buried in an avalanche of #nochanges spam
---

I wish I was serious enough to RP.  I did have fun as a paladin handing out hate literature against the pagan Night Elves, but I wasn't dedicated enough to refuse to join groups with Night Elves in them.
---
I know we are making fun of classic youtubers and content creator and I agree with everyone, but Tips is the one who make the shortest and most straight to the point videos IMO, most of his are under 10min mark.
---
Part of the fun of RPGs is coming back to earlier areas and showing off your new found power. It's a sense of growth.  
---
Besides nothing stopped you from completing the quest before, they just grayed out and stopped giving XP.
---
Sadly I doubt I will find anyone I played Vanilla/TBC with before Release. I was fucking 16 when the Game released and I pretty much only played with older people. I'm 31 now so they are probably all 40+ and I bet most of them won't come back. T.T
---
Not to mention I never had a real home in Vanilla and TBC and switched Servers a few times and Guilds even more often.
---
Made this in an hour, im kind of proud of it when seeing it on my server.

I specificaly remember that happening when there was no loot trading and certain cliques inside guilds got all the loot before anybody else.
---
Even DKP and master looter didn't prevent greedy bastards from screwing people over. The absolute worst I saw was the "oops I accidentaly gave it to this guy who is also my friend, sorry tough luck it's BOP better luck next time" excuse which wasn't even rare.
---
Introducing loot trading made loot drama go way down to almost non existent.
---
They should just implement this into the wow client. They could also use it for raids. It would be a great success. There’s no way this could go wrong. 
---
I still do that.
---
And, if that was not enough, I often just /cast Entagling roots and alt-arrow up

Then, that's a lot of "&amp;case Entagling Roots" spam :Ð
---
&gt;Worriseome numbers

Absolutely not.

56,000 people is completely respectable and profitable for an MMO - especially one that didn't have to be built from scratch.

Only 8 million played in vanilla.

Thank god. A no bullshit straightforward and to the point update.
---
Thanks man! It was definitely a classic experience for me even with it being during Wratch's lifeline. I didn't have any of the xpacs at the time, but it was quite the experience!
---
Was thinking about rolling paladin and on day one making the wetlands run to teldrasil to start getting that darnassus rep since I'd rather have a saber instead anyway
---
No
---
&gt; I wasn't dedicated enough to refuse to join groups with Night Elves in them.
---
on the other hand, I remember refusing to take gnomes into groups
---
God, I would refuse to take gnomes into a group when not role playing.  So annoying.
---
I loved macing them to death as a Horde rogue, though.  They squeaked like chew toys.
---
I've got a [contribution](https://i.imgur.com/jChag5L.jpg) to the [cause](https://i.imgur.com/i1yntN2.jpg) for this one.
---
Do you remember where they said this? I told my friend they said this but I dont remember exactly where I came across it.
---
Sounds like they will only remove items added with 1.10 but not change the items that got updated to 1.10 stats
---
I really, really hope their hearthstone was on cooldown... otherwise that is the dickest of moves. Not only a corpse run but then a swim to shore. 
---
*BEMILS*
---
You're going to get push back on any "system" that assist looking for group. The entire point of #nochanges on this subject is that we're looking for the community aspect of the game again. We know there are millions of things you can do to make everything more convenient in WoW, including group assistance. That's how we arrived at BFA.
---
I did always find it a bit odd that the Aus players always seemed to have worse connections/issues than us NZers.
---
I know :((
---
But it's honestly a very sustainable and profitable number that will grow if they treat Classic carefully and with care and start rolling out  new content eventually. I mean just look at OSRS, this MMO can definitely grow
---
I am looking for a est or cst alliance guild on a pvp server. 
---
My vanilla experience- Mage cleared up to 3 horseman naxx and rank 12 pvp.
---
My private server experience is a rank 13 druid and a raiding guild with priest. 
---
I am looking to hit 60 with the first 7 days of launch and aim to farm pre-raid bus with guild mates.
---
I have a lot of experience and hope to join a semi-hardcore or hardcore guild that seeks to be among the first guild to clear content. I plan on helping the guild anyway I can.
---
Feels kinda weird growing up watching your father be fiendishly addicted to the game, not understanding why, then trying it out and getting fiendishly addicted to the game, and asking your father if he's gonna get into wow classic when it comes out and have him respond with a no.
---
Addiction is weird.
---
no unfortunately not :(
---
Exactly like every fucking private server that i have been playing on for years.  What a genious company.

PvP notes missing. Honor rework inc
---
It depends on how similar Classic is to pservers. In a lot of pservers even rather casual guilds will want the dps to be in a fair amount of pre-raid BiS or very close to 2nd BiS. For tanks you'd want to be in nearly all BiS even if you're an offtank. That might sound like a lot of extra  time invested, but since you can find/form a group for essentially any 5 man in like 3 minutes it's usually easier. It's just hard getting that tank slot in a lot of guilds on pservers since it's usually a group of people that come over from another pserver and they already know as they're lvling who their tanks are going to be and aren't likely looking for more or perhaps just one more. 
---
Now, Classic could be a lot different where a 'casual' guild is much more laid back in accepting people with subpar gear, or maybe only being picky with classes they're mostly full on so it's hard to say. Really I don't think the time difference under any circumstance is that great and if you want to play a tank just go for it, I doubt it will be even too hard to find a guild unless you're simply adamant on wanting to be the guild's MT.
---
For gold, a lot of it should be provided to you by the guild, you will likely have to do something like fishing in addition to that or some other means, but if your  guild isn't helping the tanks at all with at least a portion of their consumable cost and repairs you're probably in a really crappy guild. I've mostly played healers and we're usually just on our own in that regard unlike the tanks.
---
I think had 13 days played to get 60 as a Paladin lol. Good times
---
As someone from a small guild ZG was my first raid. Very enjoyable. 
---
He is wrong. You can disenchant everything with lvl 1 enchanting.
---
Sweet, I've missed that one. Thank you for mentioning that.
---
Okay...  He has an ultrabook, which I assumed was short for "ultra powerful notebook", but it's actually "ultra portable notebook" and it may very well not play WoW Classic.
---
The funny part is, he has item duplicates in his bags that aren't fully stacked, didn't know messy bags bothered me this much until now :P
---
I am completely in the middle, i want sharding but only for areas with **extreme** overpopulation and **only** at launch.
---
Sure it's a nice sight but when there's tons of people at starter zone taking up mobs faster than a nanosecond then it's just not really that fun and it clogs up everything and really slows questing times down drastically, not only would this help the gameplay experience during launch but also from a technical perspective, assuming they operate different shards on different servers, this could be a very very good way of distributing the load and preventing serverside lag or crashing.
---
However i would say that sharding should completely be removed a week after launch after all the starter zones and whatnot have cleared up and most people have been more distributed throughout the game world, because as you said this would interfere with friend interaction, you wouldn't see the same thing your friends would most likely due to sharding.
---
That's how it was on my server. If you need it you better be immediately equipping it. The reason they sell for so much is because Warriors *need* them. The people selling them don't, hence why they're selling them.
---
This, it's usually like those scorpion pits in Uldamann or as far as boss fights go that one extra boss near the magic-immune zombies in Scholomance or the welps in Onyxia. You aren't just going to be flinging out a bunch of demoralizing shouts if you're tanking two or three elite mobs. It's really nice in circumstances like that though.
---
yeah i remember how broke i used to be then i read about things like .... not leveling a profession other than a gathering one while leveling....not buying shit from the AH....not training EVERY single skill only the ones that help me level faster etc.
---
PvP notes missing. Honor rework is definitely coming. 
---
While there might be a large amount of new players playing classic for the first time, there will also be a large amount of people who have been playing classic private servers for years and will clear content in less than 24 hours after release.
---
I think we need 6 stages instead of 4, guys
---
I see I see
---
I 2nd this. Ram and SSDs are slated to fall %30 this year. We're already seeing significant savings there. And we're seeing fire sales on ryzen and rx/vega cards. You can by Vega 64 cards = to rtx2070s with some overclocking/undervolting for as low $370 when the sales pop up.
---
There are already faction choice polls but I haven't seen any distinguish between PvP and PvE servers.
---
This is the best news since classic announcement!!! 
---
I agree with most everything you said, but I don't think you've ever tanked, or possibly ever even had a good tank.
---
Up until at least Legion, a tank's skill made a huge difference, although by the end the class didn't so much.
---
It's not all about threat.  Spamming Cleave will do pretty well most of the time.  But as the tank you control the whole instance, and you can certainly end up going faster or slower, and smoother or rougher, depending on the tank's abilities.
---
This took too much control away from the Alliance player here. At no time should someone's enjoyment and game play be temporarily suspended for the enjoyment of someone else when approaching the enemy faction on a PVP server and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I hope they implement a war mode that can be toggled off. 
---
How dare you, sir...think of the twinks...THINK OF THE TWINKS!!!!
---
I see a lot of cloth in your future. 
---
This would actually be really fun, but where would they put it? Personally I'd like it in winterspring
---
BWL won't be available this summer.  It's phase 2.
---
What the fuck is the point of these stupid ass comments
---
There’s a couple I still see around on the Horde side that I remember from Vanilla. The Circle of Power (my old guild back in the day) and Muteki are two I still see around. I don’t get on much though. I miss seeing the badasses from The Dark Carnival 
---
got dat smith's hammer
---
Really, Darkspear was Canadian?!  I'm Canadian and that's where I started!
---
...I hated it.
---
Play on a PvE server?
---
Tbf Reddit was already a thing in 2005 and Slashdot was around even before then,  I don't think there was much wow discussion there
---
could be number pad for those of us who use it
---
"He's immune to literature?!!"
---
Cowfefe
---
July, with Stage 2 scheduled for mid November.  That'll give player something more to do over the Thanksgiving and Christmas. Then comes March for Stage 3... perfect for spring break.  
---
Lol ok champ 
---
Are there any other items that have itemization similar to this or are the others a lot less glaring?
---
It depends on whether my brother wants to play a shaman or paladin.  I generally prefer Horde but chose Alliance on this one because I think he's going to settle on paladin.
---
/s?
---
Damn... u/Scofield442 basically lives here.
---
Mages can AoE farm the non elite's in Hearthglen's mines, sawmill, blacksmith and stables. Easily 100g an hour just from vendoring grays, not to mention the rare and epic drops you can get along with a mountain of runecloth.
---
Added so much later.
---
Sorry if it already posted but does this have an eta? I am out of the wow loop.
---
there was plenty of world PvP before the honor system was created. Back in 2004/early 2005, players didn't need any incentive system to go raid Tarren Mill / Southshore. We just went and fought.
---
There are 3 options here:
---
1) Private server 10k overpopulated insanity  
---
2) Traditional 3k population servers with crazy queue times at launch and massive mergers after the population dies down in ~2 months  
---
3) Sharded servers for early zones and launch week
---
The question we have to address is: *"What can be done to make Classic WoW as faithful a recreation of Vanilla as possible?"*
---
So let's look at how each of those answers that question.
---
1) Massive pserver-like launch.  This is explicitly *not* like Vanilla WoW.  The game would be unplayable for a week or two to anyone wanting to make actual progress at a normal rate.  You call out a "real server launch" in your opening argument, yet cite servers that *literally were not official* as to how things "should" be, which doesn't make any sense.
---
2) Traditional 3k population servers.  This would preserve a true Vanilla feeling for a while!  The problem then becomes one of player retention.  A while back, Blizzard revealed that 70% of players didn't make it past level 10.  So you'd be faced with servers that, after a month or two, have dwindled down to what, ~500 players?  Servers would be utterly dead, and merges would be a necessity to preserve any sense of community.  And how is playing on a server for 2 months before being merged with another any different from playing on a 2-month long shard?
---
3) Larger pop servers with sharded beginnings.  Yes, this is going to impact the crowded feel of launch.  But after a month, once populations have dropped from 12k to 5k, it's going to feel a lot more normal.  After two, three months, once larger numbers of folk start hitting 60, it will likely have dropped closer to the original 3k cap.  And it will have accomplished this all without impacting the community of the game at 60.
---
Starting zone shards are a necessary evil.  If you want a game that's both playable *and* preserves the sense of community we're all after, there's no better alternative.
---
Why? It makes fucking zero difference, just like DM being in at the start. People completley fail to understand something's about patch itemization and content. Some change's were just genuine mistakes blizzard fixed that make the content no harder or easier.
---
I'm in contact with exactly one person I played vanilla with - my brother.  I honestly don't expect him to stay because he's got real life now.
---
The impression we have right now is that we'll only have to pay the sub to play Classic.  
---
Not sure what the final word is going to be.  
---
Druids are aweseome in PvP, they are basically CC machines and can weave in and out of combat with great mobility and survivability. Great class overall IMO.
---
they're the best tanking boots until you get tier warrior gear, due to the massive amount of dodge you'll get and there aren't really any other alternatives. This means they fetch quite a high price on the AH.
---
Why does bow matter?
---
as long as they treat is carefully and with care. 
---
Moohummad 
---
You're arguing with a robot, ya' goof
---
Loot trading was absolutely included in vanilla - it just took several days and the intervention of a GM.  Huge pain in the ass for everyone involved.
---
Trolls also get Bow spec, which lets them reach their hit cap faster. On top of that Trolls have higher base agility.
---
It’s Blizzard man, what do you think lmao? I’m sure for the sweet sweet price of $59.99 and $14.99 per month we can enjoy it 
---
Not to burst a bubble here but it’s difficult to “switch on the fly” due to very expensive talent changes 
---
Neither option would massively suck in my eyes. Just arguing for small differences. I would prefer to have a crazy launch, than sharded world/chat. Launch week happens but it gets normal one way or the other. I want to see the insanity, not just what Blizzard thinks is the right thing to see.
---
I didn't even use the launcher for a lonnngg time.
---
I plan to be a warlock as well. Until DM releases (which will likely be 3-4 months after release) Warlocks will have to simply use their Felsteeds and save their gold, or learn the training and get an epic mount while waiting. Personally I plan to level a gnome warlock and get exalted with Darn. to get a saber since those are my favorite epic mounts. I'll still do the dreadsteed quest once DM releases though since it still looks very nice.
---
Cowboy
---
Absolutely agreed, yeah. And luckily we've been seeing them lately communicating and listening to us, so it's looking really good.
---
Every Friday night my mage friend and I would go to the horde hub in ashenvale and totally wipe the place out of npcs and players
---
Rodger that. I thought I remembered a video I watched saying that you wouldn’t have to repurchase the game. If they resold it I wouldn’t care. As long as it was a box set I could go stand in line for at Walmart and meet my local guildies :D Today was awesome!
---
Vent sucked
---
Get feral charge, get nature's grasp, get nature's swiftness. Focus the rest of the points where you want, the game play is pretty similar across them all anyway.  
---
You use your entire kit as a druid in PVP. You don't stay in form, you don't chain cast balance spells. You have to weave everything together perfectly. Master it and you become a god in PVP.  
---
I see, that makes sense. I guess it's been so long that I forgot how itemization could actually benefit certain classes in different ways despite looking kind of strange. I'm too used to retail where everything is pretty cut and dry.
---
this post is some psycho shit
---
Damn this is accurate lol 😃
---
/ReleaseSpirit
---
Helps after that rogue kills you in STV over and over.
---
Roll hunter and do princess runs, ez 
---
I want a box set then! Do they still do that? I haven’t played since TBC. Hell I haven’t owned a computer in 10 years.
---
&gt;finally
---
They always have been listening 
---
I don't mean changing talents, I mean changing forms in PVP. I mean, considering we are a lot less reliant on attack power and spell power in vanilla compared to live, that should be possible right? Cast some spells, move to cat or bear form until your mana regents, swap back and forth?
---
They mention that the PvP notes are missing. I'm guessing an honor rework is definitely coming. Why else would they reserve that schedule? They're already determining how loot effects the game and are making changes to the release schedule. They know their player base just isn't going to be the same as 2004-2008, it only makes sense for a rework.       
---
Maybe you have thoughts instead of downvotes 
---
&gt; You use your entire kit as a druid in PVP. You don't stay in form, you don't chain cast balance spells. You have to weave everything together perfectly. Master it and you become a god in PVP.
---
That's what really intrigues me! I've always wanted to play this way but it's never really been possible seeing how they have taken away hybridization from druids over the past several expansions. I don't need to be the best at any one role - that's not how it should be for a hybrid IMO.
---
I think you are underestimating how crazy it actually is in starting zones, especially if the population cap is higher than it was in vanilla (and if it isn't and the game will be as popular as people think, there will be too long queues for the most popular realms). Most people would prefer a playable launch instead of not being able to do anything :p
---
Never played any WoW games and recently felt like I really wanted to try it out. Not sure if this is the right sub to ask this but should I play the current WoW or should I wait for classic to get a taste of what everyone experienced years ago? I understand it might not be the same as it once was but I am hoping to make my own memories with some other friends. Thanks. 
---
Same, Classic Thru Wrath then an alternate timeline with different content from retail 
---
Is terenas still a server?
---
There is no "best" PvP spec for druids. There are some key talents you want to get in any build that is Feral/Resto focussed:
---
1. Usually 14 points in balance to get Omen of Clarity and 3/3 Natural Shapeshifter.
---
2. Feral charge.
---
3. 5/5 Furor
---
Anything that you build from there that also makes sense will be good. Obviously you want to adapt your gear to how much you spend either on Feral or Resto. Resto will gain you and your team better long term survival, and most importantly Nature's Swiftness while Feral gives you more damage and a nice stat buffer if you reach HotW.
---
Alternatively you can skip the Balance points entirely if you feel like you profit from more points in either Resto/Feral, but keep in mind that good PvP Druids Shapeshift a ton and do it fluently, so those points in Balance are going to really help with that.
---
It's private server video, but look up Stormx  
---
Him and Finalflash are about the best you're going to see of druid play.  
---
Summer 2019.
---
It was at blizzcon: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
Hah I remember Dark Carnival.  Damn that was a lifetime ago.  I left Eonar when they opened up the free transfer to Oceanic servers, It was pre-TBC but after Naxx had been out for a while iirc.  Most of my old guild transferred to Mal'Ganis around the same time.
---
Maybe they could fracture servers by number, and have small population caps, then as they see fit, based on level spread or w/e, they would recombine them as they see fit.
---
Completely agree. Classic should continue on its own path. 
---
Seriously though... if there is one thing I'm looking forward to about classic it is the return of the "Deep Delve". I wasn't the great of a player but I remember being absolutely enraptured by Gnomeragon and Scarlet Monastery. I got to BRD before BC dropped and I never saw all of it until much later. 
---
As of now, it's frozen at 1.12.
---
1.12 talents will already make MC a joke. And certain items will be in their buffed state. My understanding is that they're adding items as they were in the patch progress, but the upgraded version of an already existing item will be there. So Savage Gladiator Chain and all of the hot upgraded blues from BRD will be a thing.
---
Wait can someone explain this to me lol? I haven’t played a second of wow of my life but it sounds like they are re-releasing the old games?
---
This is your standard hybrid PvP build, it's fairly uncommon and isn't great.  Lets you do a little bit of everything.  Wearing this with tier 2.5 would allow you to do anything (poorly) in a pinch.  I highly recommend specializing into only one or two talent trees and swapping gear.  But to each their own.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0LhMmZxG0oZVEooco
---
This build is a feral focused build, also called HotW build.  It's not a true hybrid build, it's just feral with an emergency heal because your gear isn't going to allow you to heal and feral dps/tank without being changed out.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxTMsf0dLVEooco
---
This is what I'll be going with:
---
14/34/3
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZVgrscbdtc](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZVgrscbdtc)
---
Care to elaborate, which 1.12 talents make the raids ezmode? 
---
No pop in, plus you could tell your friends, hey we're going to start on Sargeras 06 and still find your friends without needing to party up and change shards right in front of your face.
---
Why not? It seems like a natural pick
---
It's gonna be all discord this time around.
---
Overwatch wasn't even $60.
---
Thank you! Have an upvote!
---
You don't think having DM at the start makes content easier?  Hmm
---
[me](https://pics.me.me/wot-n-ternation-11136082.png)
---
YIKES
---
Prolly phase 2 or 3.
---
Will classic be EXACTLY like the vanilla game or will there by some minor changes (besides bug fixes)? 
---
ohrly, the thing thats going to bring down a large game developer that has pros making games all day long is going to be the thing a handful of scrappy amatures did on their spare weekends
---
&gt;move to cat or bear form until your mana regens
---
Bruh you can die in less than 5 seconds in PvP. You don't exactly get to sit back and regen a full mana bar.
---
The raid size lowering was pretty much needed. Wrangling 40 Nerds into a raid was a pain in the arse.
---
Sunken Temple sits very firmly in my top 5 WoW dungeons of all time. It was truly a thing of beauty.  
---
(1: Blackrock Depths, 2: Blackfathom Deeps, 3: Sunken Temple, 4: The Burning of Stratholme, 5: Maraudon)
---
The upgrade in armour would not be worth the loss in other stats. Besides it's not like the mobs suddenly hit twice as hard just because you're level 40 rather than 39.   
---
Not to mention people generally have no gold left at 40 after buying their mount.  
---
Just ignore idiots like that
---
Keep what you have, replace it as you go.  
---
The guy you were talking to is a moron.  
---
That first build is terrible. Like, do not ever even bother with it bad. HOTW is a great spec however.
---
Well I think you mean RFD not RFK. RFK is a level 30 dungeon so a 41 warrior could probably tank it in leather. RFD itself is done a lot pre 40 so you don't need plate to tank that either. Plate is pretty useful for the next dungeon (ZF) but by then you should have plate in some slots from quest rewards. It sounds to me like you are thinking too hard about it. The low level dungeons can sometimes present a challenge but none that requires AH bought gear.
---
This kills the playerbase. On the other hand, I don't have to know the playerbase is dwindling because I literally never have to see them! Win-win.
---
/s
---
I couldn't remember - I thought D was the pig trench, not the Spiral. My mistake. 
---
Definitely don't trade in blue mail for crappy plate pieces. Armour is nice but you always have to balance it with stam and strength etc. It probably takes a good 5 levels or more to replace most of your mail depending on how many dungeons you do.
---
They haven't mentioned revamping the gear. All they have said they are doing is removing items added in 1.10 from the dungeons, until P5.
---
So we can assume that  the T1 mage helm will be the 1.12 version.
---
So if we talk about mage BiS items, this would mean that items like the cloth belt from the BRD arena would be in its 1.10 state rather than its 1.1 state. 
---
In short they seem to be doing what kronos 3 did, which was just remove items from the loot tables while not touching any of the actual itemisation.
---
So this is progressive items, not progressive itemisation.
---
It might kill it for some private server players, but not for the majority of people imo.
---
It's been discussed in other threads and nobody knows.  Imho, the expansion content will just be sitting there on the Blizz hard drives and they will already have experience rezzing an old game, so if there is adquate demand they will push out a new expansion.
---
It's possible to get Exalted with Darnassus by doing all available, level appropriate Night Elf quests in time for roughly level 45. Just plan out your questing route ahead of time and be a Human.
---
OxDEADBEEF
---
I also recommend the episode with Nixxiom and Asmongold.
---
They're doing progressive content patches. There won't be progressive stats, progressive talents, or progressive raid mechanics. That would just be very confusing and annoying for the vast majority of players.
---
Naxx is overturned on private servers
---
It's still (hopefully) at least a couple years down the road before they'll even begin to seriously think about these two options, assuming they release phases every four months or so. If, in that time, Blizz proves themselves true to their word, then I think it would be cool for them to tie up some loose ends regarding content that was planned but never released for vanilla like Hyjal, Uldum, Grim Batol, etc 
---
There as well probably, but for me I played RS much earlier than WoW but didn't play much at the time vanilla was released :P
---
Looks like Azeroth is back on the menu boys!
---
The bosses do but they are easier. It's to do with the interactions that aren't in server data. Essentially private servers had to just make things up and its net result is easier encounters with harder bosses.
---
No need to apologize, I just wanted to let you know.
---
Can anyone confirm if Humanoid Slaying works in pvp?
---
This is perfect.
---
git gud at pet control
---
Oh god that one's good... Well played.
---
That's a great one!
---
Haha! Epic
---
That's great!
---
This one's my favorite in here so far. 
---
PvE rotation is mainly curse, shadowbolt spam and shadowburn on CD. During early progression warlocks lack spell hit and there are many aoe fights, so hellfire is more dps than shadowbolt.
---
10 minutes long, in all the right places
---
it does not
---
There were a lot of top end guilds with feral druid off tanks, and for some fights, feral druids were actually better. They had the most threat in the game by a long shot with the right items, and the most mitigation in certain fights. 
---
You're parroting a copypasta tbh.
---
It was good for Horde (though what server wasn't eh? Stonemaul Alliance also got absolutely obliterated in battlegrounds until cross-server BGs were introduced). 
---
Peace be upon him.
---
Heh, nice.
---
You guys think you want this but you dont
---
Srsly, this is not as great as yall think it is. No 20man content. Shitty itemization, only raid is MC which will be a fucking joke regardless
---
Wtf were ppl smoking when they tought thid was gonna be a major net positive? 
---
The things we will lose (have gated) are not worth doing progression as it was in vanilla.
---
I was there all the way in vanilla and I am now just feeling like the living proof you cant please everyone. Honestly id rather start with everything and fuck it. I dont wanna spend the start of classic suffering in mc for shitty gear. Fuck this.
---
Love me a good 1 AM mara run. Something about that dungeon has great feels late at night.
---
OP, if I might interject here, think of the drug hybrid play a little differently and I think you'll find much more success.
---
Pick two trees that you would like to play. Typically both feral and balance pair well with resto but usually not eachother. I always recommend grabbing nature's swiftness in any spec, regardless of role unless you are really intending to focus on pve DPS (and in doing so completely ignore the strength of a druid).
---
A 1-29-21 build will allow you to tank or heal in pve (off tank or heal in raids), and let you have a versatile role in pvp. Being able to insta-healing touch yourself or allies is incredibly strong, as is insta-root. It will also allow you to flag carry in wsg while also being a top tier duel spec, and also bring a lot of utility to group pvp.
---
Feral charging to interrupt a heal, then a good ol warstomp to further delay the heal and interrupt nearby casters, then faerie firring the nearest rogue followed by a root to peel him off your healer who you then NS regrowth + rejuv to save the healers butt. Bear form and bash the enemy healer again, whose heal target is probably dead by now. Pop barkskin + tranquility to heal all allies near you, then catform sprint to chase down that pesky mage. Shift out of his Nova then charge again to close distance after his click, a couple mauls to his face and he'll be toast. If he ice blocks just regrowth + rejuv. If he ends IB early (the mage will if they are good) and CS's you, shift to bear and frenzied regen. If this sounds like fun to you, then play this spec. You legitimately have a counter to almost any strategy if you know what you're doing.
---
The same can be done with balance + resto specs, but I never considered myself very good at those so I won't comment on what an average fight might look like. Just don't expect to pull off many starfires. Moonfire + root + wrath will be the bread and butter.
---
The key to playing a druid effectively in pvp is being adaptable. Fluidly transitioning from one role to the next in order to counter your enemy and provide what your team needs in that particular moment. I often find that going in without a gameplan allows me to adapt more easily and effectively 
---
Deadmines is still in
---
Yup, they are creating seperate servers for vanilla or classic WoW, the game before the burning crusades expansion.
---
OP: once you realize that the truth is over half of Reddit is Non-US, the voting and anti American rhetoric makes more sense.   
---
EU communists can't stand common sense and thought out debate.    
---
Downvote away! 
---
Same here. 
---
Never use whites. AH if you absolutely have to, but you probably wont need to for most pf your pieces. Also, the Jouster's set is pure dogshit despite being lvl 40 plate. The other lvl 40 plate is called Embossed I believe and is way better. Again, should only be buying if you desperately need an upgrade tho.
---
This is either super late in the open beta, or early release in 2004/5.
---
This definitely isn’t closed beta.
---
There are a number of things on the screen which were not available in closed beta and were pushed in the last patch for open beta which then became release.
---
Cool video though. 
---
Why draw a line? Keep them coming. Other mmorpgs do it, WoW should too
---
I haven't played the very latest iterations of current WoW, but it is a very different game and gaming experience from Classic WoW.
---
My suggestion is that you wait til Classic comes out; so many other people are gonna be in a similar boat to you, insofar as even if they have played before, for many it might have been 10+ years since Classic so a lot of people are going to be pretty "new" to it. I get the impression that most people playing retail now have been playing for some time; the community (and game?) might be less approachable to a newbie.
---
Not disputing that current tanks have more abilities and perhaps a more thorough roll - only that all of them are homogenized so disastrously that as a group, its very little difference to you which tank you bring (almost none).
---
At least one Oceanic server please.
---
You guys are going to make me cry.   
---
I'm a career huntard.   I'm damn good at it too.   
---
You get the point of a hunter!     
---
It's a support class. We hold the raid together with utility.   
---
Aggro control, mob/add control, marking targets, range sniping mechanic objectives, bombs, rocket boots; being mobile to do whatever needed whenever its needed. 
---
It was a bit of pride to be a really good hunter.   
---
Like you were saying, it was always good to have a hunter really on the ball in a raid. 
---
Wrath still feels like the peak for us, and I *really* miss that. 
---
Blizz has forgotten. 
---
They took our mana, they took our weapons, they took our mark, they took our aspects, for most of two xpacs they took our dmg, they screwed with our pet attack.   
---
We're not much more than face rolling pure dps now.   
---
Rose-tinted glasses I suppose, but it's honestly not as fun anymore.   
---
To be a bit fair, I do like playing my hunter as BM this xpac more than at all during legion.  
---
A small step forward.   
---
If I could get my mark and aspects back, I'd be happier.   
---
I'll take the stun risk of old cheetah to get to where I'm needed. The new cheetah might as well not exist; better results just to disengage backwards.
---
World PvP, lol.
---
Naxx had some pretty great fight mechanics IIRC. Never got to raid it though so its all heresay
---
Seeing that UI, that clear UI should I say, that's why when I rarely subscribe to WoW for nostalgia (and get bored with it in a week :(( ) I don't install any addons. To me that UI is love 10/10
---
Flexing that 100g cash stack
---
Forgot.about classic scholo.... and temple... and lbrs...   and rfc... and stockades...   
---
Wtf blizz, lol.
---
Hi, /u/Raelalmighty
---
It blew my mind that there were 4 portals in Scarlet Monastery when I first arrived. Getting the key felt like such an achievement then there were so many bosses with crazy loot!
---
Definite changes. Blizzard has stated that they are starting the game at patch 1.12, which was the second to last patch to be released before BC and the last patch constituting what we know as Classic. The vast majority of Classic content was therefore experienced by players with the differing game mechanics represented by patches 1.1-1.11. This means that the Classic experience will depart from what many people played through before BC. That being said, they do still plan to stagger content (unclear if this pertains mostly to raids/battleground/events or ALSO itemization) in such a way that mimics Classic, ie, not all content will be available to progress through from day one.
---
Other changes include automization of GMs (no humans!) and the possible inclusion of sharding in the early stages of the game (first couple weeks?) to deal with the initial congestion before server population stabilizes. They have also brought up the idea of including loot trading; I sincerely hope they nix that.
---
Beyond those broad topics I'm not aware of any other planned changes. Someone else chime in?
---
Battlegrounds won't be there so I don't think the honor system as we know it will be there. Not positive though.
---
Does this mean people won't be playing paladins and warlocks at release?
---
I think your right.  After this, we moved to Black Rock &amp; used the lava.  Black Rock wasn't open during beta I don't think.
---
true true. 
---
As a Classic enthusiast I am celebrating old ST is coming back, as a tank im sweating how much of it ive forgotten...
---
I’m just happy you kept the video.
---
I lost everything.
---
Multiple pc changes and I recycled all my old decrepit harddrives as I upgraded along the way.
---
Didn’t use Photobucket or anything similar.
---
RIP
---
We should commence server openings with a 40 man raid on hogger. 
---
I agree, but he asked for it.  Haha
---
This may seem like a silly question but is this just content release or is it also class balance in each patch? Or do we get 1.12 class balance from the start?
---
To piggyback on this-- as you're leveling, the price of spells will begin to increase at a rate disproportional to the amount you make from questing/grouping/running dungeons. You're better off passing over some of the spells available to you to learn, at least until you have your 60% mount at level 40. I remember hitting 60 (as a priest) and still not wanting to spend my hard earned gold on niche spells like Mind Soothe or spells not in my (then-Shadow) damage rotation like Holy Fire. I don't even think I bought max rank rez until it was time to start raiding.
---
tl;dr: the gold bottleneck is real, make sure you dont buy spells you wont really use leveling so you have enough $$$ for mounts / gear
---
The whole idea is to emulate the past. If you have ANY other expectations, you will be disappointed. It's not just some fun server on the side, it's the beginning of WoW again.
---
Also Mara Princess runs and selling loot
---
BRD is so awesome, feels like a raid that’s easily accessible. I just wish I could find 4 tough Boys that are willing to do the entire dungeon from start to finish with me
---
Tee Bee See!!!!
---
I was way too impatient for this place pre cata. I dont think I ever cleared it aside from some of the mini troll bosses for 49 twink gear. I hope too make atleast one full clear this time.
---
Doing what you want isn't the same as listening.
---
For all we now, this was their plan regardless of what people here wanted.
---
The areas outside instances were sometimes almost as fun as the instances themselves. I loved Uldaman, in particular. It was really exhilarating being a lowbie exploring Loch Modan and wandering into the Badlands just to immediately see a meeting stone and seeing a big group of ?? Horde players hanging out there. Then, when finally at the level to run the instance, there's winding tunnels full of treasure, quests, and secret entrances/exits. There's lots of long quest chains that can only be resolved by traveling across several zones, fully exploring the complex, and making multiple runs.
---
Now, everyone just teleports straight in with every quest literally right next to the entrance.  Nobody talks during runs. It really takes the adventure out of the game. 
---
Same. Main priest, will play Pally in Classic. I have enjoyed every second of priest healing; I just want to try something different / challenge myself a bit on my next go around. ~~I definitely don't just want to Reck Bomb my way through leveling and wear the coolest T2 in the game even if the itemization isn't great for Holy~~.
---
That is... absolutely insane
---
But that 1000g can literally equate to an epic BOE item that is a NEED for your said class. Epic mount money etc. Its too much gold and gold is to valuable to everyone to pass on.
---
Hey, dumbass, we wouldn't even have Classic if it wasn't for them. We need to let giant corps like Activision-Blizzard know what we want, loudly and often. If everything was quiet, they would just do whatever the fuck they wanted. It's entirely possible this change was a direct result of the "200 euphoric" youtubers. Stop being a corporate apologist/slave. This isn't Blizzard 2004. This isn't gaming 1990-2010. You absolutely cannot trust a video game developer and publisher to do what is right by the gamer anymore. You need to be very very vocal.
---
I know.  I honestly can't believe I still have it.  Crazy how long its been.  
---
I also seem to remember sheeping people (mage) while they were swimming &amp; watching them go strait to the bottom like a anvil.  Baiting Alliance out into Booty Bay waters &amp; then, adios...  lol
---
I want to kiss you OP
---
The right answer to this is don't worry about it for 1 sec. 
---
Just play the game and enjoy.
---
Can anyone explain what this means from a noob standpoint?
---
Part of the vanilla experience is the craziness. Plus with us being veteran wow players I'd think that we would have no hesitation grouping up to complete quests so that we can start making friends right away... with sharding the experience becomes a little less invested in the world and the community of the world and becomes more about me me me.
---
Which is a non-issue since locks are horrible early on and so are spriests since there's practically no spell hit gear.
---
It was really hard to find a group for it, and even harder to find one where anybody in the group knew what they were doing. We would cobble together knowledge like "I remember a boss being this way..." 
---
Get a new computer and stop bitching.
---
Had lost all hype for classic with recent happenings with Blizzard but this announcement is perfect, shows that the team knows what they're doing
---
I was poor always I felt like.
---
The gnome raids on Argent Dawn when Blackrock crashed were hilarious.
---
Just what I wanted to know, thanks!
---
No, mc is face roll for anyone who can put 40 people together. It makes zero difference. Source I've ran a guild that has cleared it over and over for 7 years on countless servers. And we're terrible.
---
It will be much easier now, the competence of the average player is exponentially higher than that of the average 14 y/o in 2004.
---
But really though, it gives me anxiety thinking about which server to choose, and the list isn’t even available yet
---
Oh my god SC was my first server ever. I will be back with you my friend!
---
Sunken Temple might be one of the dungeons where this butchering doesn't bother me all too much. Vanilla ST is incredibly monotonous. Other longer dungeons in classic are varied and interesting.
---
May I ask why that would be a priority? Wouldn’t it be better since they would attract more people to party with?
---
Is phase 3 even. So who knows how many months that’ll be. I was there at BWL opening on Nost, hope it’s gonna be as epic on Classic too 👀😎
---
Scarlet Crusade and Silver Hand, HERE I COME
---
If a DPS refused to enter because I, as the tank, wasn't geared for the instance, I would gleefully kick him out and let a non-asshole in.
---
RFD is where you go to *get* plate.
---
Though some loot in DM and the large amount of gold that can be farmed from DM is better and more efficient than anything you can wear or gather from MC, is that correct?
---
Pretty sure that since you now have your account info you can log onto the Battlenet website and download the full game without paying a dime. Then when classic releases, start a $15 subscription and you are on your way 
---
Don't flatter yourself, no one has sexy curves like those.
---
we. think. we. do.
---
Is there a classic discord community created I can join the bandwagon on?
---
Stirring the pot is basically the point of endgame
---
Should it or not?

[A summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SbjASLwA34&amp;t=)
---
As of now, 1.12 class balance from the start.
---
Yes
---
Tauren look sexy with this set and Rokh Delar
---
Oh please stop with this excuses for implementing stuff which doesn't belong to Classic. 
---
You simply ban those who share accounts, everyone has to deal with the same issues. If you can't manage a raiding guild in Classic without account sharing you shouldn't leading that guild in the first place.
---
It's called trusting in other people like officers. I know this is a very strange concept if you only played retail in recent years, but you have to get used to it coming to Classic.
---
I could see huge faction imbalances for people trying to play with their favorite streamer, would be shitty for both sides. 
---
I’m really nervous about server selection. I feel like when the time comes to first log in I will not feel prepared (Illidan memes aside)
---
Watch his warrior deep dive with monkeynews and you'll understand
---
Don't ask tips, he has no idea.
---
Blizzard is creating seperate servers for vanilla/classic WoW, the game as it was before the burning crusades expansion. 
---
I'm absolutely agreed with you. This isn't so sudden surprise.
---
I have to agree.  We all know exactly how mmo launches go that don't incorporate some sort of instanced starting zones.  It's rough, servers crash, people cry, and if it is successful while saving blizzard loads of cash I think most will be fine with that in the beginning.
---
We will have to see what blizzard's game plan is for that case, and I hope it doesn't impact normal interaction for any longer than it needs to.
---
I am sorry but common sense is something that can't be found from US. 
---
Dude, what you're essentially saying is you hate if people get paid while doing content. That's like you going to a supermarket and telling the cashier that you don't like him getting paid for handling all your purchased goods. 
---
So essentially you don't like people that are getting paid for stuff.
---
I'm glad if content creators get paid for their work. I even try to give em money if I'm really happy with their produced content. But I hate when some people do it just for the money - getting out a video every day just to get paid from ads and such. this usually results in shitty content too.
---
If the content is great and I love it, I hope they get as much followers as possible and make a lot of money, so that they can produce more good content. 
---
Making a video is not that easy. You have to put in a lot of time to do it right. So if you have a full time job and a family, you can't really be the best content creator in terms of quality. So it's nice if they  get paid a lot from making content on Youtube or Patreon or whatever. So they have time to do the vids and being with their family. 
---
Prob longer imo.
---
Cool. All i really want to know is will they change the undead passive so that all of fucking horde isnt immune to fear?
---
Pvp is severely imbalanced because alliance cant use warlocks. Period. Even priests are badly hurt from this
---
So are they doing 8 or 16?
---
It would have blended great with how WC3 dealt with Pandaren as well. The Brewmaster was never seen unless you hired him, and the secret zones (like the waterfall behind a forest) prompted a Pandaren screenshot that filled the whole screen. It was cool and secretive that made the Pandaren enjoyable, not MoP
---
Now they just gotta come out and say they won't allow shared loot and all will be well!
---
Kinda wish they mentioned the mounts thing too
---
Imagine being this dramatic 
---
Wow, a beta video that's actually high quality. Post more dude, these are ancient relics. I lost my 2 vanilla videos ages ago.
---

No, you'll like your activision game filled launcher with dead games like destiny2 and COD.
---

Is this a joke? 
---
Good bot.
---
I hated every one of them.
---
FOR THE HORDE !!
---
Dude was an idiot. Unless you've got good blacksmithing yourself or some guildies willing to hook you up at-cost on some early greens, it's not remotely worth it. Threat is more important than armour in dungeons anyway, so you basically always want ~10% more damage dealt over 5% less damage taken, which are the kind of tradeoffs you're looking at.
---
We will see, it was possible on private servers but since they reverse engineered it from a tbc patch with increased reputation it isn’t necessarily true for classic.
---
If you're wielding a dagger, put flametongue weapon on it. If you're using flametongue weapon, wear gear with spell damage.
---
If spell damage gear is not available, wear gear with str/hit/crit/agi.  
---
If wearing melee DPS gear, use a slower 1h weapon like an axe or a mace.  
---
If using slower 1h weapons, use rockbiter/windfury weapon.
---
I want sharding 1-20 for the first two weeks or so. 
---
We will see.
---
There is no decent bow of rok, alles good ranger items are xbows. Even rok isn't much better then bloodseeker.
---
Perfect, thanks.
---
You messed up when you started to assume that everyone who is interested in classic wow even goes on Reddit, let alone frequents this sub.
---
I messed nothing up.  You didn't read my post.
---
&gt;And there are a lot of people who will join who are not subscribed to this subreddit.
---
Very nice but with 1.12 talents from the start still a mile off. but it is something.
---
Shadowburn is only a dps increase if you ignore ISB. However it cant apply ISB making it a slight dps loss becaus you essentially are having less applications and more chzrges eaten. Ignoring ISB however its a dps increase until aroudn the 2k sp mark which isnt something achievable
---
Who knows, many games get rushed these days. And they can release it without having worked on p2-6 as they will still have lots of time for that.

I understand if the video is just crap overall so 10 mins of something like a shitty top 10 is bad. But I also totally understand people stretching videos to 10 mins. As long as it’s entertaining then it’s fine. People seem to forget that if you wanna try and make a living off of YouTube you got to make your videos 10 mins or longer. It’s not the only way, but it’s an effective one

---

---
That's a pretty niche change, I have to claim ignorance as well. I also heard there is in later patches an elite in the upper arena which periodically stuns players, making mage arena farming in BRD a bad idea as well.
---
I am sure mage and hunter will still be top tier farming classes pre-dm. BRD farming not being an option is quite the surprise to me.
---
KIL’JAEDEN IS DOWN AGAIN 
---
The main portion of your dps will be coming from shadowbolts. There isn't as mutch as a rotation as its more of a priority system.
---
In most raids you will first apply your designated curse (being CoE, CoR or CoS) followed by corruption if the RL/CL assigned a slot to you for it. Followed from there you spam shadowbolt until either the curse runs out or corruption those followed by reapplication of them.
---
If you are to run out of mana you want to prio using Demonuc/ dark runes and Mana pots over Life tapping as they do not use up a global cooldown.
---
If a mob is about to doe befor you can get another shadowbolt of you want to finish with either a shadowburn or searingpain.
---
It is also recommended to use shadowburn or life tap whenever you got to move for a boss mechanic.
---
Would highly recommend you give [the classic warlock discord](https://discord.gg/3fvUDqF) a looksie as it is a great source for information of the kind along with spreadsheets that visualize some of thid stuff.

That's because it's not an either or. You can be running DM as usual, or be in Silithus to farm rep, etc, and mine a node and accrue more Arcanite Crystals.

It's not like just because someone took mining that they need to be or will be running in circles mining nodes instead of doing something else.

This was my first epic drop in Vanilla. I think I only got 14g for them. People thought they were mediocre back then. Wouldn’t mind seeing them drop in Classic, though.
---
I would assume they only shard crowded areas, in which case fucking around in Stonetalon wouldn't be sharded.  And in those crowded areas, you're just as likely to miss someone for the clutter (you can't spend time with 50 people at once) as miss them due to a shard.

---
Considering the new info about lack of 1.10+ items, that's a good point.
---
Casters have a huge lack of +hit gear before ZG.
---
Made by Inchina?
---
Or get the winterspring saber which is 10 times as cool anyway. 
---
This is true for people who never hit 60.  You'll get there this time.
---
What game are you even playing at that point
---
Remember when BG's werent auto-grouped. I lolled so hard everytime two children started each their raid and basically played Renly vs Stannis. 
---
Usually most other players would figure it out within a few minutes and one of the children play solo. 
---
Ya that's the point. People actually considering private server experience to be an authentic launch experience, which is NOT TRUE. 
---
Back in 2004 we haven't had a fucking 10000 pop servers.
---
We also haven't had thousands of players rushing to a SINGLE REALM at the SAME TIME.
---
Sharding is, without a doubt, bad if we're speaking about your BRM PvP or World Bosses. Levelling, however, simply was **NOT** designed to work with that many people in one zone.
---
seconding what zonq writes here. its hilarious that level 40 boots are that powerful, but if that doesnt scream vanilla itemization, nothing does
---
(the argent custodian - a level 30something mace - with +5 defense on it is perhaps an even more extreme case of a low level item being so strong)
---
His life avatar is a warrior, and I think he’s intending to play warrior? But he doesn’t even appear to know the basics. Has this guy *ever* played the game? 
---
lol. Are people still whining about the monthly fee. Back at release the price was rather steep, but now? Seriously?
---
You can use a item that chance your aperience, so its all legal 
---
So there is this Shaman on youtube that also happens to be a scientist IRL who did some testing and it turns out that (after level 30) the best weapon imbue for a one-hander is actually windfury and the best imbue for a two-hander is always rockbiter. Though the differences are pretty small and you can get lucky with 2h windfury, I thought it was interesting.
---
agree with the others. replace it as you go. youll find plate relatively quickly and there are some quest rewards that help you up your armor count
---
Here: (buy some potatoes)[https://www.pcgamesn.com/power-gaming-did-you-know-you-can-run-your-pc-on-potatoes] and stop bitching.

But the real question is, will this version have updated 2019 graphics? Think of the beauty.
---
Noggenfogger elixir? I meant permanently
---
As far as I'm aware he didn't cap in vanilla and never played at endgame but I think he does care even if he isnt ultra knowledgeable.
---
You know you're right, mechanically tbc was more fun for every class, especially the unviable  raiding specs from vanilla. My biggest bug bear is thematically, it feels all wrong. It suffers from disconnect of the world by leaving azeroth behind, even the leveling zones feel like they have less staying power than in classic, which is exacerbated by your eventual flying mount. I wish they had been able to solve more issues in vanilla without breaking the world at the same time.
---
I think vanilla is quite sum up here:
---
- epic are already so rare that you screenshot them when you drop one
---
- farming standard mobs might be quite dangerous
---
- the big UI
---
- the shitty skin
---
- (speculation) bags are full so the boots where not auto loot, so you must clear the bags
---
I member...
---
The introductory raiding spec for ungeared locks is 30 points in Affliction and 21 in Destruction. Something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0ruRbkVZZgx0tM0z
---
When you get better gear and/or want a pure raid dps spec, that's when you go for Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin, x/21/21+.
---
At 8 debuff slots in MC, Locks put on Curse of Elements and Curse of Recklessness; if Lock count is 4-5+, then Curse of Shadow *should* get more consideration, but isn't guaranteed. At 16, CoS is used, hopefully in conjunction with a Shadow Priest.
---
Literally not true, but whatever works for you, man
---
Ort of Deception 
---
I will let people who will equip it need it.  I dont care about gold in vanilla or in any game.  Id rather let someone enjoy themselves than have 1k gold in my pocket.  Making a friend and spreading good vibes is so much better than being a greedy dude with an epic mount one week faster.
---
Nah you've just gotta make shitty videos about low level zones as that is the furthest you've ever seen then conveniently lose your job when classic gets announced and start getting decent subs to piggy back off pateron dollars.

Raids aren't the only end game content.

Mara is mostly very linear. Especially considering most runs are just people porting into the end section, which is basically on rails, since nobody kills the goblin.

We expect all members to be well prepared before raids with knowledge of strats we’re going to use as well as full consumes and world buffs. All this information will be posted well in advance for each class and role. 
---
Members will be expected to be helpful where possible and respectful to the rest of the guild, if we all work together we will be able to achieve much more, much quicker. 
---
We believe faction pride and PvP is an important part of Vanilla. As well as our achievements as a guild &lt;Earthsinger&gt; will strive to work with other horde guilds to secure faction dominance on the server. A friendly relationship between active Horde guilds on the OCE-PvP server will ensure we have a healthy and thriving community. 
---
Socials are welcome, having a small community of socials and friends improves the guild atmosphere. Socials will all be expected to be kind and respectful to ALL players on our faction as your actions will reflect upon the entire guild.   
---
Any questions don’t hesitate to contact me on Discord @Polyrhythm#5944

Based on the info I've seen from [Defcamp &amp; Melderon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGm8RmKIW0EF1RfmNFVr2-Q) this isn't correct.
---
We used to use hacked files to do those model changes. And it was not allowed.

We also need to disable voting in the United States while we are at it. Because back in my days there were no Donald Trumps, only Bill Clintons and Barack Obamas.

You have no idea how much I toldy family "pretend like you care just lete tell you about [in-game thing that happened]
---
Who am I kidding this is classicwow of course y'all know what I'm talking about
---
Shard level 1-5 starting zones and nothing else maybe..? Sharding durotar/elwynn forest etc I think would suck so much already.. 
---
I think the proper origin was a Twitter user (I believe it was xposted to /r/BlackPeopleTwitter)
---
"I saw my ex getting jumped by 5 guys so I helped out

---
Very much depends on your class. If you are a healer, for proper gold grind you cannot do solo. You need a warrior and certain professions. But like i said, i will levelup 4-5 L60's in classic for sure. So i dont count the "lost" gold because i wouldnt be grinding gold anyways on my main.
---
Vanilla was full of dick moves. People would corpse camp for fun, meaning you'd spend half an hour getting ganked, running back, trying to rez and run, only to die again, etc. Part of the experience imo.
---
I would say Warlock is the class you search for 
---
Just take the boat to Menethil, swim towards IF and die in the right spot. Rez at Dun Morough and you're set. IF flight path, Deeprun Tram, SW flight path and you've got the traveling routes all the way up to 30+. Even easy acces to STV through Duskwood. From Darkshore get Ashenvale FP, Stonetalon FP and you've got Desolace waiting around the early 30's. Don't worry man!
---
I played lock and felt bourgeois as fuck having more than 100
---
Take off your gear that can break and die ? Doesnt change much, just few less bag spaces.
---
You apply a curse and then you spam shadowbolt. And sometimes you do nothing at all because you’ll pull threat. 
---
Depends on the server progression really. Mages have the focal sword that they will want atleast when they do the dungeon for their level, or early in the server progression they want it as a decent preraidBiS. Shamans want the shield for their mp5.
---
I rarely skipped it personally when I tanked the dungeon (however on pserver, therefore people were well aware of loot and the application for their class).
---
Well put
---
Plus still running 14 slot bags
---
DMN dogs, spiders. Some do kill the 1st boss (most skip it, it takes quite a bit of time and you absolutely need enchanting to make it worth doing). After that run DME, do the lashers there. 
---
That with skinning (dogs) and herbalism (~2 nodes you can take in DME every run). Add the sometimes spawning book DME.
---
I hate ST.  I had so many groups turn into 4-5 hours slogs because someone wanted to the entire dungeon and we kept wiping due to group stupidity.  The place just depresses me.
---
Love the excitement after completing a dungeon. 
---
To be fair I mained a rogue in vanilla. I had 8/8 T1, 8/8 T2, done plenty of PVP, etc. I can't remember if demo shout would remove stealth, it's been so damn long.
---
If players popping in and out can be avoided, though... They should split each server up my numbers each with their own population cap per race. Then as players disperse merge the servers back together. That way there is no players popping in and out, and people can tell their friends, hey lets all go to Sargeras 8 on launch day okay guys?
---
That's excellent reasoning.
---
Shaman/Pal are the most under-represented healers.
---
Warlocks are the most under-represented DPS. 
---
For a "Do some PvP, farm and raid without respec" -- I'd say warlock is where it's at. 
---
Ancient Chinese secret.
---
Have a question since i didnt play Vanilla, but Onyxia and Blackwings lair sounds like cata stuff? 
---
Wasn't SM one of the places you'd go to get some early plate? I can't remember this far back.
---
Attention epic garrison gamers😎
---
^fuck nope can't do it
---
I've never forgotten.  I killed my first rogue in Desolace using it.
---
I'm not saying that Blizzard should do anything about it, but people *will* try to get their stuff back and *will* try to get Blizzard to help. And in case the account gets stolen, there can be chargebacks and other expensive things happening.
---
Majordomo still sends shivers down my spine in a good nostalgic way. 4 tanks, 4 continous cc, continous target swapping, i just loved the chaos of the fight. Only thing i loved more was Razorgore. Sometimes I just stood on the top of the channelig platform and watched how everybody does their specific part of the job.
---
There was addons for it, but I’m not sure if theyre allowed. I’m not sure how would one get caught either
---
I wasn't full pate until around 52 on my warrior. If the states on the mail item was a lot better than a plate item, I kept the mail.  And I tanked a lot of dungeons while leveling.
---
I should be 60 by phase 5 or 6. Exciting.
---
Phase 7 of course.  They release all the raid bosses on the world and the world is consumed in fire and QQing.
---
video games are srs bzns
---
moorpheus
---
Fuck all of these youtubers. They had preliminary schedule and now they released info how they will do it. 
---
You didnt make it happen. They have been listening ALL the time.
---
Please tune it down with the all caps post. You are not more important than anyone else. Thank you. 
---
Someone actually went through the trouble to use photoshop for this meme to bash on someone for making videos online. Talk about a great vanilla community huh?
---
More importantly they did confirm patch itemization. Thats much, much more important than DM at launch.
---
MPQ editting. Its how I did back then.. No tMorph or anything at the time
---
Might be hunting the blues from the minibosses. Some of them were off the charts like cadaverous armor which blows early raid chests straight out of the water: [https://classicdb.ch/?item=14637](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14637)
---
You can do a miniboss run by jumping down the bridge into one ghoul pack below, go to rattlegore, kill him and straight to Ras/minibosses. These runs take like 20-30minutes with possible high level loot.
---
haha. You americans. Calling a dungeon by its boss initials. Non-sensical and just weird. Especially since the mines were there first. 
---
End retail and continue the story after Wrath in a way that isn't a complete shit storm of nonsense. While also maintaining the older style of gameplay and progression. 
---
EU Communism is working for me :)
---
Eh. 1% crit really isn't worth wasting time for, when you could easily get [Zum'Rah's Vexing Cane](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18082) or [Hypnotic Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7714) and [Spirit of Aquementas](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11904)
---
You wouldn't happen to have the link to video? I know I saw a video being recommended before that tried to take a scientific approach but the data was pretty flawed.
---
Retbull- Tauren retadin 🤓 
---
If i was a warrior, i would still sell them because thousands gold is worth more than a dps increase for me :)
---
No, RFD actually had a little. SM is basically all mail and down. 
---
Friend just do this: weapon proc of choice, ninja frost brand - light night shield - flame shock - heals - nothing else. (Lightning bolt for pulls)
---
If you are talking about lh, then no i'm not playing on this shady server.
---
TBC was designed for flying mounts (fuck flying BTW), and even if it didn't have flying, outland obsoletes azeroth.
---
Then northrend comes around and obsoletes outland.
---
They're not expansions of the world, they're a brand new "stand alone" game everytime.
---
I was talking more from a pserver standpoint with staggered itemisation following vanilla item upgrades in which Hypnotic Blade didn't get the upgrade until patch 1.10, therefore Blade didnt have Spelldamage and Zum'rahs have a shitty drop chance.
---
If the group is just done with princess there is really no reason to not jump down and clobber away on more trash for 4minutes to give the shaman and mage a chance on improving their gear.
---
You have to low key sell it because trademark and all. 
---
The problem there, like doing onyxia questline is, that you need to leave the instance to keep on going. Resulting in a lot of people in different stages of the quest. On private server on my warr alt, im on "hope" quest, everyone wants to do from the start or jailbreak thats AFTER the q im on.
---
The only change i would like for them to do, is to make it possible to do it all on one run. Another thing about BRD is the huge range in mob levels. Group that does the early parts easy might be in trouble in the end.
---
OMG, love this. 
---
As a horde hunter I made it my mission to tame the rare crocodile (sewer beast?) in the stormwind canals.  
---
I had this hydrocane staff that gave me underwater breathing, so I just swam around stormwind back and forth until it spawned. Occasionally guards would aggro, but I could just feign death to drop combat again. Was not killed by enemy players even once.   
---
As with many things, the journey was more fun than the result. When I got the tame, I promptly stuck it in my stable and went back to my usual pet.
---
It depends a lot, for example a certain prealm i am in has a lot of silithus black lotus spawns inside the elite caves, cloaking device is great to drop combat for long enough to loot the lotus. Also if you plan on running solo DM:tribute you need engineering.
---
Healers are the best on the other hand if you want to be the best enchanter/tailor or anything else as well, all the professions are good. But they also require a lot, having enchanting ie. is one of the worst, unless you are in your capital 24/7 and manage to get all the enchants and are active in selling them, then you can make a small fortune. 
---
Simply said, do what you want, you are not forced to do it one way or another, but as others have said, for money making certain ones are way better than others.
---
Same here cleared everything except KT on my rogue. Can’t remember that specific thing either..
---
Oh no he's retarded :/
---
&gt;Majordomo still sends shivers down my spine in a good nostalgic way. 4 tanks, 4 continous cc, continous target swapping, i just loved the chaos of the fight.
---
Or private server tactics. Group everything up (apart from domo) and aoe everything down. Its still chaos, just different kind...
---
To me dungeons are just a way to have fun. I definitely take bg’s more seriously. 
---
I’m sorry but if he was rank 13 and you were 12, you don’t have a say in this, he is a higher ranking officer and you do what he tells you. /s
---
Hmm, well this forum is for Classic WoW, not private servers.
---
I'm grateful for private servers for keeping the dream alive, but if you're on the subreddit, you should be talking about the official Classic release.
---
sure it should. And fuck booming voice btw.
---
"$10 million per year" isn't this the salary of anual pay of their chief fiancial officer ?
---
You were almost bang on the money! 28 minute video!
---
I'd rather not have stupidity shoved in my face when playing my favorite game all the time. When I first got to lvl 57 on EL (spring 2016), I simply lost the will to play and stopped, due to how bad it was then. When the server was down I even went on discrod. It was so insane there I had to puke. There has been a very noticable reduction in ns/cryptofascism/racism/misogyny jargon since then (after the break up perhaps?). (Note that the EL misogyny cryptos were blue pill af.)  
---
It's not that I can't deal with it, it's that I find it very toxic and meaningless to have racist jokes be the only fun jokes that people can think of. Jews, blacks, asians, leftists, normies, noobs, just about anyone were targeted.  
---
I get that it is fun to shock and stick it to the man, and I love politically incorrect stuff in general. I do find racist jokes fun at times, and I totally get that the mainstream media is super idiotic and should be avoided and ignored at all costs, but what does race has to do with all that? Nothing IMHO and I got super tired of listening to it, it's not a friendly or positive environment I enjoy and it is not a community I want to be part of.

Part of the great thing about wow is that it brings people together - you have no idea who that gnome mage is. I play with people I would never have a chance to interact with IRL, teenagers, foreigners, people of completely different profesions, rich people, poor people. I don't need to live in a box. Playing wow is about having fun with other people, it should be about the game and individuals, not about some idiotic US political agenda or specific brand of toxic personal/psychological problems of a certain subspecies of neckbeards. /Rant out.
---
Someone making a living out of playing videogames all day sure can stomach some banter. 
---
I never sub for anything. I have a lot of friends that aren't into reddit and still will play.
---
Alot of the gear in mc is worse then alot of blue gear in any 5man/15man dungeon at max level. Sure dm has some pretty good pieces the main problem is that blizzard did not really make gear for min/maxing until nax take class sets for example 
---
Well, ackchually most of WoW vanilla the hypnotic blade was worse than focal sword, because it got patched in 1.10, therefore most people would've killed goblin. 
---
But in the end its semantics. 
---
I expect them to have the improved gear right out of the gate. I only hope they dont have stuff like executioners helm right when classic hits, because these items are seriously good. 
---
I would love to see that if you choose WoW Classic from game menu it makes launcher look like this. Keep buttons and other things as they are but use these textures.
---
Where do I buy?
---
karazhan at lvl 70
---
I guess. Just seems weird to me. 
---
Off-hours farming is something I might consider. It only just occurred to me that my 4am wakeup time is useful for some things like this.
---
&gt;to me it seems like a flimsy way to justify your literal greed over a literal need
---
The thing is that no one actually "need" that item. You can go through all of vanilla up to naxx and never worn this glove and be fine. Sure you would do better with it but you don't "need" it, it is not required to progress. And it's also not like you "need" to drop it to get it, you could just go farm and buy it. So the argument that this guy "needs" it, is just absurd. 
---
The right word is that this guy "wants" this item, but everyone else want it too. This item would save him a couple of hours of farming, well it would also save me a couple of hours of farming, so we both want it equally, it wouldn't make him more happy than me to get the item. 
---
The real question is does he deserve it more than me ? And the answer is no because it's a world loot, it was absolute sheer luck that the item dropped he didn't do anything more than me to deserve the item.
---
He doesn't need it more than me, he doesn't want it more than me, he doesn't deserve more than me so why should he get the item over me ?

Unsurprisingly, elemental is the best, which I've been telling everyone for years, but no one has ever listened. 
---
If it was a choice between 6 or 3, I'll take 6. I'd rather it go just a bit longer. I've played the EQ progression servers and I feel like 3 months is a bit too fast. A lot of people that grew up playing vanilla now have lives and other things to do.
---
absolute madman printed it out
---
Nothing, people have been playing Vanilla on private servers since 2004 and nobodies complaining about lack of content.
---
Hey I started on Stonemaul (Alliance)! I never did much pvp before cross-server BG’s were a thing though. Cool to see it mentioned.
---
The class that fits your requisites the best is mage. Much better farmers than warlocks, but there are much more mages than locks. Resto/elemental hybrid is a decent choice, the PvP spec, because you can raid with it, it's just not optimal. 
---
NA Horde PvP.
---
Looking for a casual level guild to do 5 man's and occasional PvP. I'm a vanilla veteran and serial leveler. None of my old friends are coming back, but I want to make the most of this opportunity. 
---
What people would have done is irrelevant. It's what they will be doing in Classic that matters.
---
According to the latest Blizz statement, all items created after patch 1.10 (e.g. Spellweaver's Turban, Diana's Pearl Necklace, etc) won't be added until the AQ patch. All other items will retain their 1.12 itemisation state, e.g. Ban'Thok Sash.
---
I suspect things may be different this time around. People forget what the internet and the world were like in 2004. People had far less access to information. Video games were still seen as fairly nerdy. The first iPhone was still 5 years away! A lot of people playing wow did zero research and just dove right in. In today's world I suspect most people will read a couple "what should I play" articles or watch a similar YouTube video for 10 minutes. 
---
Timeline wise it would make sense for honor/rankings to be introduced in patch 2 and BGs in patch 3/4 I think.  They will most likely move BGs up and introduce all 3 at once unlike in vanilla since a large part of the population will get bored of world PvP otherwise.
---
You move onto a different game, possibly a different expansion remake by Blizzard.  I think altering content in Classic servers just because an arbitrary amount of times has passed would be a mistake.
---
Alternatively, seperate fresh realms spring up after the phases complete.  I don't think we'll ever see a Lv60 version of Karazan for example.
---
Rofl
---
Aye true. This post was in fact to make fun of those two (and gazillion others) previous posts wondering the same thing everyday.
---
That's because he would post it a lot different. And based on his previous videoes, he would probably get excited and get ahead of himself and conclude something which the post can't do. It's good he's hyped, but content creators have to state their opinion, and not try to outline some objective world they can't grasp entirely. 
---
Someone should make a reddit post at release for everyone to tell what realms they’re heading to etc. For good population 
---
Can mages raid with the aoe spec tho? Or farm well without it
---
I kinda doubt there is much demand for raid mages cuz there are so many
---
It's not a no-true-scots fallacy because I'm not claiming there is a "real" blizzard. Indeed, the real mistake people make here is thinking that activision and blizzard are different companies blaming failure on the former and awarding success on the latter.
---
I'm saying that the old company is gone, which is true insofar as we live in a different time with different economic and social influences and with different people in charge.
---
I think you're just sensitive because I've made the switch from liking blizzard to mostly disliking them for the choices they make.
---
Classic was made by a different company, it was different people with different intent. The only thing the classic team is doing is dredging up a game with most of the framework intact. Their best success will be not changing anything, because this is how little implicit trust the community has in this company.
---
If a friend is abusive and constantly makes choices that help them at your expense in the short term, you cut them off. I don't owe blizzard anything. They're a company, and they've shown what their focus is, short term exploitation, and I don't respect that.
---
Such an amazing time!
---
I joined that raid group too (redzytv) and recognise names from this video! Something that you don't often experience anymore with retail...
---
Big shoutout and love to Mecela, Bowjobs, Roshkpaw and Spiritz! 'Betrayed in Ratchet' FTW!
---
"All Need" was the common philosophy on my server (Frostmourne and then Blackrock). Guild runs are different but PuGs are full need on epic BoEs.
---
I admit you‘re right in a few points you mentioned but overall it is still sick and senseless to express dissent of it because it shouldn‘t bother you in any way? He makes ad revenue with a low effort video? Let him make his money it‘s his job. I probably would do the same if I‘d be a content creator and have to earn my living expenses. 
---
But it still shouldn‘t affect you cuz you said that you didn‘t even watch his video so whether the ads nor the video in itself should annoy you. This amount of hate content creators get in general is absolute exaggerated.
---
I subscribed almost all content creators on youtube and honestly watched all of em to see their reactions and opinions to blizzard new content release plan, i actually GIVE a fuck and LIKE these kind of videos and the amount of likes/dislikes ratio and views esfands video got on youtube proves that the vast majority of players do care and likes these.
---
G8 b8 m8
---
\&gt;  It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't disappear when you logged, but that simple design aspect kind of killed it for me.  
---
they don't...?!
---
Pretty much. They would have to open up way too many extra servers just to make the 1-20 experience not be a shit show. And extra servers just fragment the community apart. If they can do a temporary solution, and have as few servers as possible, I'm all for it.
---
Omg that feeling o\_O
---
My question is: What will happen to those who are joining Classic, let's say 5 years from now? All patches are already released, how could they experience the events of the past (such as AQ opening)? 
---
Are there going to be F R E S H server launching once in a while that will be merging to some older servers? How can you solve this, or do you even want to solve this? 
---
Do raids actually take many palas tho? Priests are still better generally. Palas are mostly tank healers and there arent many tanks normally. In 40mans their single heals dont bring enough group value. You'll have what? 3-4 palas?
---
Entire reason I'll be joining the carebears over on the PVE servers. It's a part of the experience I rather not revisit.
---
Guess first action of the day will be farming BRD:arena for that sweet savage gladiator chest then. &lt;3
---
till you end up eating your dog
---
Its been brought up nonstop homie lol. Peep my post about post Naxx content, or any of the other few dozen that got traction.
---
Have you visited this sub before? There are posts about this daily.
---
Start PvP at phase 2 with level 58 blue rewards, upgrade the rewards to buffed level 60 version @ start of phase 5 war efforts.
---
U mean type all greed and you click need
---
You either are in a guild clearing naxx, progressing naxx, progressing AQ ect. 
---
Maybe you're pushing for rank 14.
---
Maybe you start it all again on an alt.
---
I honestly don't see what else there could be and I'm not in favor of adding new content.
---
Around 4 sounds right, yeah. You would want that many just for blessings (salv, might, wisdom, kings, light, sanc, etc).
---
You can certainly PvP and raid heal as holy. But farming would be terrible. For PvP/Farm/Raid - I'd go with warlock. Really, really easy to get into PUGs especially as a lock. 
---
I'm just speculating but maybe there will be fresh new servers popping up time by time with the content release plan. Like if all content have been released on let's say 10 classic servers and Naxxramas is on farm 5 new servers will popup with stage 1 and so on. 
---
Got activated myself around nostalrius shut down a few years back. Played some private servers and enjoyed the hype of those fresh realms. None of that took away from the hype I have for this release. I have the talent calc app open constantly. I have my first 4 characters race, class, talents, and professions planned out. I want to experience this like before and lose myself to this game. I miss it.
---
Honestly, it's the shared nostalgia and good feelings of this community that make me excited to play again. I feel like I'm coming home to brothers and friends.
---
Unless you play gnome.
---
Can confirm 25g and agree that's conservative. Have tested this a recently as December. 
---
Get an addon that shows your dps. You will find that weapon enchants have spell ranks and the best one shifts depending on rank and gear. 
---
Don't think it will be obtainable until the AQ patch, going by the blue post on the forums
---
He was aware of that thumbnail... explained the choice in a comment in that video's thread
---
I totally agree with you sharding is probably the best solution to early game crowding. That being said ther is nothing hindering blizzard from making the shards any sice they want we can easily have enough ppl in an shard for it to still feel kinda crowded. I for one hope that all the non pvp zones bar cities will be shared 
---
Isn't there Gnomergan-Booty Bay transporter as well?
---
It's definitely vanilla stuff.
---
Going by their current statements, only items created after patch 1.10 will be excluded from the game.
---
Anything that existed before then will be in their 1.12 itemisation state.
---
Tonight nano from nost is back on classicast.
---
I think these pools aren't very accurate based on my exp, usually, the majority of the pvp pop ends up undeads.
---
Its not like we didn't know about buff stacking/world buffs in retail Vanilla.  It was just a pain in the butt to do it and if we actually got 40 people to show up at around the time the raid started it was going to be a good day.  Private server people are just a bit more hardcore and dedicated that they are willing to show up early to get the buffs even though one wipe negates it all(more incentive not to screw up).
---
What will they do with items like Ban'thok Sash, Star of Mystaria, Cluth of Andros etc. Weak caster items early on keeping the same name being buffed in 1.10 with very strong stats +dmg and +hit. Change those stats or just remove them? There aren't many in this situation but a few do stand out like the one's I mentioned that would be overly strong for a fresh start.
---
Aq40 Skeram chest is the next upgrade. Also Savage gladiator chain, when it got upgraded in 1.10 in to a fury chest
---
Yes our damnable adaptability! How could we change something to make more sense!
---
I tested this and it seemed like i spent atleast a full day more of /played drinking as elemental on my way to lvl 60. I love me some Elemental but enhancement is the faster lvling spec. 
---
I think it's kinda cool that you need to stick together as a group, and have a semblance of a plan before heading inside.
---
ST felt really mysterious with the puzzles and weird paths you had to take
---
My argument is perfectly clear. Think any game. Like Mario or Zelda on the NES (or even Diablo or Warcraft :). They are old games you can play now. They are not changing anymore. It doesn't matter what was "planned" for them. Classic WoW is the same. It should be a completely static game which you can play at any time.
---
And we agree, this whole "content rollout" is completely pointless from that viewpoint. I won't care for it. I've created a "no rush" guild exactly for the purpose of enjoying the game at our own pace.
---
(Although I'm sure from a technical standpoint Blizzard would have liked to release the game as a complete, done deal, they felt it necessary to "appease" people with the content rollout. Conveniently, it also prevents people to "play through" the game too fast, meaning more subscription money for Blizzard. I'm sure it wasn't a hard decision after realizing that... :P)
---
Time to stock up on [Living Action Potions](https://www.wowhead.com/item=20008/living-action-potion)
---
Yep they sure can.. Deep frost is a very viable spec, Arc/Frost is the preferred spec for raiders as you do maybe 10% more damage over an entire raid.  I have dabbled with many variation, and have never had any criticism of my raid dps. 
---
Excuse my ignorance; with this content release are we still getting the 1.12 balance state for classes upon launch?
---
Hopefully it gets ran OSRS style. Fresh servers or BC would be the irreversible nail in the coffin.
---
Makes more sense? How in the name of the Warcheif does it make more sense. You have an original dungetion called Deadmines abbreviated DM. Then comes a 3 wing dungion called Dire Maul, and instead of using a new naming convention here, or use the wings for abbreviation, the americans choose to rename DM to VC for its dungetion master, and name Dire Maul DM, an abbreviation that needs a post-name anyway.
---
No my dear amercian, it makes no sense at all.
---
I understand the point you're making (that even 56,000 subscribers is plenty), and I agree with it. However, as you and other comments mentioned, I'd be surprised if the subscribers here make up even 10% of people that'll play Classic. This group especially doesn't account for players in Asia.
---
Dang, I always mix up gloves (C'thun) and chest (Skeram) annihilation pieces.
---
Look up the July 16th Stuff, it seems a little out there but it’s all we have and there’s no reason for some of the stuff other than blizzard baiting us if it isn’t July 16th
---
Summer means summer.  Anywhere in between.  Now if we want to "theorize".  I would say they better get in on it by July.  If they wait till August they risk hurting their hype with everyone going back to work/school.  A june/july drop is most likely where it will be.
---
The first iPhone was relased summer 2007.
---
How to tell this is a legit vanilla SS. 'Hop in vent' and 'mc' for miss-click
---
I'm convinced those were troll posts, so I removed the last three. Also removing this post since I removed those, sorry!
---
Vanilla was reasonably difficult for a large portion of the player base. It was 2005 era, access to information was very low compared to 2019. The casual wow player spent maybe 400-500 hours levelling to 60 only to discover they had horrible gear and the skills the used levelling had zero relevance to their game-play at 60. A typical player spent all of level 60 keyboard turning, clicking abilities, etc. If you took the game seriously, learnt the encounters and paid attention then it seemed like all the other players in most pugs were incredibly stoned or something.
---
My vanilla guild was semi casual. It had about a 5 player core of really hardcore players, 10 semi-hardcore players and maybe 25ish more casual players. 40 mans were twice a week and we cleared T1, T2, most of T2.5. AQ40 was where our raiding fell to bits because the casual players were hitting their skill cap and didn't like wiping that often. 20 man content was easy because instead of being 40% hardcore+ it was 75% hardcore+ in our raid composition. The same casual raiders who didn't want to show up for 40 man progression would suddenly be /w for spots in a full 20 man raid (i.e. they wanted easy gear).
---
Vanilla will likely be much easier this time around. Playing video games is more normal, people watch videos on their phone when they're bored, etc.
---
What they've said so far indicates that they will exist in their final vanilla itemisation state.
---
FYI: there is almost no +hit on caster items pre 1.10.
---
See: [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/edit#gid=1992086259)
---
Stage 1-3 is Launch, Dire Maul and BWL patch. Literally 1% hit in BiS...
---
The fact is that casters get shafted compared to melee in early itemisation. If you went for full progressive itemisation, you'd see raids with 90% melee dps.
---
The last two were jokes because of the first two.
---
Kill 15 people and you're rank 1 :)
---
Nowhere did they say that item stats would be changed. Only availability. If an item is available you have to assume it has 1.12 stats, because that's what they have said.
---
Worth it at that point.
---
Wait, there were quests to learn Backstab and Sap in early Vanilla - sounds awesome ?! Or are you talking about the Poisons quest ?
---
If Classic is a success, the next logical step would be to head to TBC.
---
Ah, I got bamboozled!
---
Yeah, and I need L2Read blueposts to the end.
---
Talents/abilities will stay how they were 1.12. Only item database will change
---
true, i agree with you there.
---
Shouldnt buy anything except weapons when leveling.
---
good loyal Horde soldiers /salute their comrades upon successful jumps in proud tradition
---
Thanks! Yea this is the one. It has a pretty large flaw, well 2 actually.
---
The first flaw is that this information is only useful for this particular mob. I don't know its max HP or defenses and this can change a lot mob to mob.
---
The other large issue is that this is tested on mobs 5 levels lower than him. This means it accurate if you are grinding 5 levels down, but inaccurate on equal.
---
This will heavily sway the elemental power for the following reasons.
---
1. The mobs have less health, this means less lightning bolts and therefore less time drinking.
---
2. Mobs will be dying faster and therefore be getting hit less. This is moreso for ele which will have a larger percent of their damage at range as consequence.
---
You're right. He was geared for the time. Those DoTs chewed up 50% of my life. 
---
I just started to try out with my GF on something half-scripted and we're loving it. Exploring, knowing you actually can die.. We lvled to 120 together in BFA, it was the most grindy shit ever. Both of us think so. Story is good, but the gameplay terrible.
---
But in vanilla, it was fun just to roam around. To get to a copper vein is an adventure. We loved it and can't wait for classic.
---
I guess you’re talking about rank 14, not rank 1
---
always greed since I am not an asshole.
---
this "BoE = gold" bullshit is a bad justification for beeing a dick.  
---
every damn item that drops = gold.  
---
the only difference is that this here is more gold.  
---
according to some guys here its cool if I need on any item as long as I deem the sell value high enough.  
---
8g for a 2hand weapon? justified need.
---
note: still hoping for the "need on BoE = soulbound" rule
---
i am very eager about when they will introduce bgs. seems like they still evaluating. would love to do some bgs while leveling. but i know they werent there at the start of vanilla. i am fine with both ways. but i would love to find out soon :)
---
I think you are the wrong forum, this is classicwow which is a recreation of what once was
---
For new ideas and concepts you probably want to go to retail wow at /r/wow
---
Link pls
---
"and this is absolutely insane!"
---
yeah. that would be really cool!
---
I played a lot of warlock. Kinda want to try something else.
---
Yeah that's my bad it's early , rank 1 as in top rank =p
---
This is very much the case, but depending on if they make the mounts or the skill cost more (changed during vanilla), it might be more efficient way to get the warlock/paladin mount for the skill and then buy the normal mount cheap so you get both, because the other way around its just gonna cost extra. If they do the price swap (which I doubt), you could technically get the riding skill cheap and wait for cheap mount to come, but for me atleast getting fast mount will be priority #1 after getting to 60.
---
Ummm you just used the body of the paragraph to explain how it makes sense.... a new dungeon came out that is bigger and so they decided to change the naming convention of the smaller dungeon. Something changed so humans adapted. 
---
HYPE
---
&gt;My argument is perfectly clear. Think any game. Like Mario or Zelda on the NES (or even Diablo or Warcraft :). They are old games you can play now. They are not changing anymore. It doesn't matter what was "planned" for them. Classic WoW is the same. It should be a completely static game which you can play at any time.
---
Mario and Zelda haven't changed since their release so we can play the original. 
---
Diablo had patches so we can't play the original. 
---
Why aren't you arguing for the original 1.0 client running off original servers? nothing else is authentic. 
---
It's very hard to say. As someone who has played every expansion of WoW, I have no idea what the experience would be for a completely new player anymore. 
---
In current WoW, generally, the only expansion that really matters is the latest one. The levels up until 110 don't really matter. Sure all the quests and zones are still there, but it's a very rushed experience. 1-60 in Vanilla took people months. Blizzard now want people to get to the latest expansion as quickly as possible so everyone plays there. 
---
If you want to try it, go for it. It's still a good game, depending on what you're looking for. A lot of stuff is handed to you and you can solo pretty much all the content in levelling zones. 
---
Classic WoW on the other hand is a hard and at sometimes tedious experience - but the fun comes from the adventure you have. All the levels matter. The game doesn't start when you hit 60, it starts from the very first moment you create your character. 
---
I have been of that observation for a while. No longer. 
---
In fact, what is equally unhealthy, if less time consuming, is the assumption that social classes should transfer from RL to wow. 
---
We all know that the R14 people and full time pvpers and on benefits, at least some of them. They have probably given up on findkng a job, for now. Having a chance to attain the highest rank in a forum where the middle class are the plebs, is to my mind very politically incorrect, bordering on revolutionary, in this day and age. 
---
Vanilla is truly from another time. I find it very important that they keep it as it is - it’s going away in TBC after all. Scarab Lord is almost the same thing btw, should that be removed?
---
What’s truly unhealthy is the mentality, that these things should be obtainable to *me*, or equivalently, that the highest achievements should be hidden from us, to not rub our mediocricy in our faces, so to speak. This is a falacy, choices in life should matter, and wow should work just like that.
---
This is how retail has developed: with transmog and the removal of mythic raiding loot, there are no longer any very visible marker to differentiate you from your peers if you happen to master true wow competency.
---
Yes I realize that spamming bgs every waking hour for three months is pretty much unhealthy, but so are many of the high avhievement jobs out there. Who wants to work 80hrs? Then dont go for ceo or R14!
---
I’m truly tired of all the new people posting ”I guess R14 is out of the question for me, right?” Yeah you bet Einstein! It’s an expression of envy, one that probably mirrors a sneaking realization on part of the questioner that he might have done better in life. Get on with that, and leave the nolifers alone. They have their own path to walk, and the beauty of wow is that it creates a true community with all of the annoying and inconvenient and envious side effects that come with that. 
---
This is actually a good thing. I hate the ide of have to get gear that will be BIS in 2 months time. It really only caters to the top % of players. For sure keeping gear that was added in later patches timegated is  a good ide but let's hope that ones a item drops it will stay the same
---
This is excellent
---
I like ST but definitely think it's overall standing would be improved hugely if it was also broken into 2/3 wings like SM was, rather than straight up blocking off huge sections with the "revamp". I know it essentially already is, but people don't really see it like that.
---
Since 2005 I've found it strange how emotional people are about the requirements.
---
I see it as high ranks and big rewards available to the fighters who commit to the war effort against the enemy. There can only ever be a small group who hold those ranks and get that gear and so their factions bestow the rewards upon their most committed champions. 
---
As you said, you have no idea what a solution is. I think that's because there is no need for a solution. Get rank 9 or 10 if you wish. Let the most committed players earn a rare place the game. 
---
All the pirate would have to do is tickle his armpit and he'd fall over. 
---
This makes the content harder and more rewarding in a nutshell.
---
No man!
---
Honestly, my fun, other than pvping on my druid, was to do my regular farm circuit in the Burning Steppes. That was my home. Tons of thorium veins. Plenty of runecloth to be had. I even picked up quite a few BoE epics there that I would sell. Since I was primary OT for my guild I ALWAYS had my tanking gear on me so I would always help those trying to do quests there. Particularly the epic quests. 
---
With that said I always followed the market. There were times, depending on others alt cycles, where odd mats would also fetch a great price. Copper, mageweave cloth, mithril...always had to know where the best farming circuits were
---
Private server "vanilla veterans"
---
Personally I agree.
---
Full Progressive Itemisation is so obtuse and counter-intuitive for the same reason the progressive talents are. 
---
Why would you willingly repeat the mistakes of the past? Talents and itemisation only sucked because the devs didn't know any better.
---
It is not true, private server world buff mechanics are not correct. It will not be going to raid with 10 world buffs and 10000 up as a tank. Therefore with only 6k hp you can't take a crushing blow and survive so therefore this whole no shields rubbish is just PS crap. As a healer I remember tanks that were not able to get crushing blows off the table going from 100% to dead in 1 second. This guy wants us to believe that you have 2.5 seconds after a bit hit to use a macro to stop the next crushing blow.
---
Yes tanks did spec fury/prot to get good TPS but no-one did boss tanking without a shield. It was not possible. The PS crap about world buffs mixed with incorrect boss hit, stats, armour and resistances has led the PS 'pros' believing shit like this. Half his argument is use a 2min CD armour buff. This will not be done as it share the same CD as  healthstone which is far more important when saving a bad situation when the bosses hit properly and toons are not unrealistically buffed.
---
As for flasks, the joke that is the black lotus respawn rate on PS is so funny as to be a big joke. There will be a handful of flasks possible to be made a day ACROSS THE WHOLE SERVER. You will not be flasked every raid unless you are the main tank or stupidly rich.
---
Be under no illusions, this video is full of PS information that will not work come classic because it presumes data on PS servers is accurate when anyone that actually knows, knows that it was all guess work.
---
How is that at all logical?
---
Yeah I just feel there could be some kind of improvement to system I just don't know what.  I feel like just endlessly grinding isn't the best system,  mmr is probably better but has its own problems too.
---
I just feel like 3 months of no-lifing it in this day and age is kind of a bad thing to push,  I like that only 1 person can be that rank each week that's totally awesome to me,  I just feel the way to attain it is not totally awesome.
---
I really do love vanilla and hope that only a few changes are made, but I feel maybe this should be the 1 system where they maybe look at how to get r14 
---
Don't horde have a lot more quests there than Alliance?
---
Though I guess horde go there are lower level than Alliance, so you're at a disadvantage in average player level. 
---
You are quite right, they want to lock down you, your positive PR on social media, and your money!
---
Because the re-release of Classic WoW succeeded, and popular consensus is that TBC is just as desired. 
---
there was a similar raid in cataclysm, blackwing descent, involving nefarian and onyxia (end bosses of aformentioned vanilla raids)
---
By that argument no-one needs any item and everyone may as well just roll need on everything vendor it all. 
---
So they came back alive? Kinda confused now
---
Yes, I think it should be.
---
I don't know how it should be, but forcing people to play 16 hours a day for 3 months to get the best rewards is encouraging extremely unhealthy behaviour. Both physically and psychologically.
---
Yeah, those patreon bucks they robbed off of innocents who have now lost the will to life and unsub, truly a macabre predatory approach. Down with 10 mins vids!!/s
---
old wow is a totally different game from new wow, it's hard to compare them. you might like it tho so might as well give it a shot come summer
---
The most logical is when it's ready.
---
Thank you for your reply.
---
If you're a blacksmith, then you can start crafting mithril armor around 40 or 41 though I believe there is a quest that you have to finish prior to being able to craft them. It has good armor and stamina but shit else. Buying anything off the AH, particularly in the early going, is not even remotely advised. Money is not easy to come by and even being able to afford your mount at 40 is a borderline miracle
---
The last boss of SM armory drops a great mail chest that I remember using for some time after 40 due to it's stats. God I miss SM. Sucks to get to as alliance but the drops totally made it worth it. It was also one of the first instances not named BFD where coordinating CC was a major boon due to all the pats and how hard mobs could hit
---
That font is horrible to read. 
---
Let him know that paladins are gonna be endgame healers and they level slow plus u dont get to tank, also rets dont do any damage whatsoever :p
---
He knows.  I'm the tank.
---
In case not trolling: there was a recent thread talking about this and many of the players from EU realms used VC. VC is not a continental thing; it's just poor genetics and low breeding. 
---
That sounds about right. I did the entire chain and bought all the items for *both* my Warlocks (both Undead and on the same server, don't ask lol), used to help friends and randoms with it too. It was fun :D
---
No worries :)
---
The first half of your sentence sure but where is your source for the second part. I haven't seen the statistics on it but if you have that data I'd love to see it.
---
This, all the PS pros will cry when they find out they can only parse half the dps and they can't go to every raid flasked and buffed with every world buff. They complain about trivial content not realising that they are playing the game in a way that is not possible in classic.
---
Yeah this is my feeling here, I don't know what the solution would be outside of mmr? But I also feel that it goes against the spirit of vanilla so I'm at a loss. 
---
Yes. Down with dungeon maps, booo!
---
Apart from missing out on Classic, it’s probably for the best anyway. I hear BfA is a real shitshow.
---
I'm not interested in a battle for Azeroth in Classic too.
---
i agree! i also think that we should disband the diablo and hearthstone teams- after all, they're taking precious resources away from wow /s
---
I played from US launch, and Demo Shout removing Rogues from stealth doesn't make any sense to me.
---
It does no damage. Why would it break stealth?
---
Wasn't the Armory helm plate, and thus a big deal?
---
My favorite macro was a /random macro. I would run around in circles outside the auction house in orgrimmar and spam it. 
---
Everyone around me would see I was rolling random numbers between 1-100 and there was nothing you could do to stop it. Good times
---
Horde is there around 24lvl, aliance past 32 or so...also Hilsbrand farms are popular place for ali high levels to screw around with leveling Horde 
---
AV was good xp though
---
PvP is truly where odd builds shined in Vanilla. Druids had so many different fun specs to use in PvP it was bonkers. Pallys did too. Shockadin anyone? Granted they had no place in a raid environment but some could still be fun to use in dungeons
---
This exists, it’s called PvE servers
---
There are plenty of polls about wanting to see a TBC expansion, and which expansion was the favourite. I'm pretty sure that TBC actually beat vanilla in popularity too.
---
I honestly can't be arsed to search for them, but that's what I remember.
---
This is a quality post
---
I'm not a dev, so I really can't say. The best thing I can think of is just removing a rank requirement entirely and having players purchase gear from honor points, with those points being capped account-wide per day to discourage excessive playtime.

Useful for healers, or people who bind their buffs.
---
This is silly. Now is my time to leave. :)
---
&gt;  Easily 100g an hour just from vendoring grays,
---
i think "easily" is a stretch
---
Is thousand needles a viable place on retail? On LH server I managed to catch up there as there is copper/tin/iron.
---
The most natural is to get to 20 in Darkshore, then start leveling in Ashenvale. At 22 or so, take the boat to menethil and do some Wetlands quest. These will lead you to the Greenwarden in eastern Wetlands. Do the gnoll quest, but instead of turning it in, run south through Dun Algaz to Loch Modan, get the flight path, and go west to Ironforge. Here you can take the deeprun tram to Stormwind, which gives you access to Duskwood and Redeidge Mountains. 
---
Well lets look at part of the reason they decided to release Classic, private servers. The private servers with the biggest populations are Vanilla followed by TBC followed by WotLK. I would not say TBC is as in demand as Vanilla, but it definitely has a huge following. Having played vanilla-legion those three are easily my top 3 versions of WoW. I think TBC is logically the next step, what I would love to see is a character copying system. I would love to leave my Vanilla character on Vanilla servers while copying over a version to play TBC. That way I have a choice of which expansion I want to play. 
---
mmm not sure i agree with that, the whole thing of being a warlord/ grand marshal was that it was a big deal you were #1 on the server, allowing everyone to get this gear would kill vanilla.
---
I'm all for having a server wide leader board, i'm just not really down for pushing a system that requires 3 months of doing nothing but WoW
---
Hunter raid spec can still farm well though pvp can be a different story. Lock and mage definitely fit the bill here and both are highly desirable for all content. Once you get some higher end gear, a fury warrior and Rogue aren't too shabby for farming though a fury warrior isnt optimal for most pvp situations. Disc priest is solid in many pvp roles and pve roles though if you want to farm you better have a mage friend to give you water
---
The map in OP's post was basically Part 2 of the dungeon; you got some quests done in the first half and there was potential for upgrades with all the Atal'ai guardians, then you did that puzzle in the basement and finally headed down to where Hakkar, Emerald drakes and Eranikus was. Even if you know where you're going it's a pretty long dungeon with just enough content to feel long without being an incredibly huge experience like Blackrock Depths. They really didn't make dungeons quite the same from Burning Crusade onwards.
---
But you’re right, pvp system was unhealthy and rewarded play time over skill. But I’m still in favor of a no change for this even if I doubt I’ll
---
Be able to go above rank 8 with my play time.
---
The commitment required was insane and for me, it It was a big part of the respect due to r14 players (and the insane mortal strike you got in the face)
---
The problem with the system is that all it shows is that you're the biggest no-lifer. It's not remotely any kind of testament to skill.
---
Then thats a huge change because that mean no officer bank account !
---
Druid probably has the most interesting pvp spec possibilities of any class. Not gonna lie, part of my endgame farming was for trying out new specs for my druid. 50g respecs gets expensive quick in Vanilla, lol
---
For the Dutch-speaking Classic fans I wrote an article summarizing Blizzard's official post en the release schedule. I hope it helps someone! 
---
To be brutally honest, you aren't the kind of person that should be tanking.
---
Tanks attract dominant, confidant personalities who take charge and tell other people what to do. If you were so discouraged by some guy telling you off that you never tanked again, then he did the community a favour.
---
Good point. I’m content with the state of progression now. IMO it’s time to start focusing on the loot sharing issue.
---
Probably warlock if youre solo or warrior with one or more healers
---
Thats the very definition of greed. You don't care what the item is just what it's worth. 
---
Are you okay with enchanters rolling on everything? They need them for mats. 
---
Thats not end of the dungeon, btw.
---
HOTW - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AATExz_cAzzwxA

change your gear - change your gameplay.   stack agilty for cat / stack int and stam to carry flags and heal
---
Resto - flag carry spec

Balance is kinda a meme, &amp; the best pvp balance spec misses moonkin form though which is kinda sad
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BaUzDx6AAsnBAjME
---
Any justification as to why Warlock would do better than mage or rogue?
---
I’d say mage. Because you can spec AP/POM/Pyro and one shot every one every 3 minutes.
---
Else, overall I’d say warlock.
---
Do you plan to achieve this?
---
Fuck PvPing as Alliance.
---
If I was gonna roll a PvP server, it would 100% be horde.

&gt;Do you plan to achieve this?

---
Probably watching television while they do it. Can confirm, quit raiding after realising I was tanking one handed on HC Blackhand watching Netflix while drinking.
---
Near unkillable by anyone in 1v1s.
---
Isn’t the English one enough? I’ve never heard of a Dutch person who plays wow without speaking English. 
---
Don't worry, I'm sure it will possible to use updates from Enterprise or some server OS
---
Like it is doing now by Vista owners.
---
I just don't understand using the term logically the next step for an illogical line of thought. It would be like saying the next logical step to a diablo 2 remastered would be a diablo 3 remastered. Logical would be stopping after vanilla.
---
A simple no you don't have data would have sufficed. 
---
Bladefist-Eu, I didn't do it per se but I observed.
---
When AQ released the top horde guild at the time, Succession, had a beef with an alliance guild called Craftwerk (to be honest, these guys were total asshats and everyone on horde had a kill on sight policy) this was before connected flight paths.
---
They strolled into Theramore, aggroed the FP and kited him to Emberstrifes cave, where they kept him alive for hours, posting on the server forums about their kidnapping and refusing to return him until a BoE on the neutral AH for insane amounts of gold was purchased. When we heard a ton of horde showed up to repell any alliance attempts of reclaiming him, this went on for a fair amount of hourse until a GM had to intervene and despawn him.
---
Was absolutely amazing.
---
How do they survive against rogues? As far as I understand they can't break stun without FAP potion?
---
On the flip side, the warlock mount doesnt take a bag spot. Which with warlocks matters since they lose an entire bag's worth having a soul shard bag, and any empty slots in your normal bags will want to  be filled with shards for raids.
---
I've seen my share of Taurons (and characters of other races) in vanilla on Stormscale, and character names where original and unique.
---
Not crap like Istabyou, Eatmyfireballs, Moohcow, etc...  
---
It's an mmoRPG... be a bit more creative with your character (at least for Classic).
---
Indeed.
---
I just wanted to make this point, since I've seen so many people in the last day shouting that we'll be getting 1.1 itemisation at launch.
---
Loot Trading, Right-Click Reporting and Sharding are VASTLY more important issues to the success of Classic.
---
As annoyed as I'd be with a full Item Progression system, I could easily deal with it. Loot Trading and such however would have a huge negative impact on the community by incentivising ninja looting.
---
vanilla wow is not for you.
---
i guess there are far more people that will play classic that are not on reddit.
---
&gt;Some players of some classes were probably doing some things suboptimally, especially if they were trying to make a cool video as well as fight. And they aren't around to explain their choices - maybe they were saving rage for an emergency, maybe they wanted access to some spell that wasn't available in fury stance, maybe their dog was going nuts and they weren't at their best, we'll never know.
---
Making a cool video doesn't make playing any harder. None of those things are justifiable, there's no reason to save 100 rage for an emergency instead of going to 75 for two seconds or so. Stance dancing from Berserker to Defensive could be legitimate if you wanted to soak damage while you're not DPSing, but that's not what the dude is doing.
---
And this is not an isolated thing - pretty much every Vanilla PvE video you can find has people making really stupid and obvious mistakes throughout each fight.
---
&gt;If people cleared MC 20% faster I'd totally believe it could be due to skill under Blizzlike mechanics. It's the claims that people do MC in half an hour when the best vanilla speed clears were three times that
---
I've never actually seen a proper MC speedrun video from retail Vanilla. Do you have one where everyone is fully worldbuffed/using full consumables and the raid is stacking melee while using the bare minimum of healers?
---
&gt;clear MC in greens when it took people in purples months to get Rag down at all
---
First of all, Ragnaros has always been killable in blues and using little to no consumables - there's loads of video proof on youtube. Secondly, the distance between blues and greens can be bridged using consumables.
---
That guy was a moron. 
---
This is the next piece that needs to be confirmed. Sharding has RUIN the mmo aspect of wow. 
---
This. Warlocks is a pain as a raiding class though with all dem soul shards. But if you want to secure a raid spot and farm well. Warlock is your class!
---
4:3 low resolution screen with totally stock ui, no keybinds (other than those that you get from start). Hes almost dead.
---
Id say thats original vanilla, but on a alt char with main feeding it with consumables, items, bags and gold.
---
A lot of rings look like that...
---
Yes. The graphics have been updated.
---
And hes still in combat...
---
Just because I'm not willing to waste my time searching for and presenting the data to you, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
---
It just means the effort I'm willing to put in is limited. For me, this means 1\~ minute typing a response.
---
I learned many years ago that large amounts of effort into an internet discussion is simply wasted time, since it will simply be ignored.
---
Would like to point out that these "vanilla veterans" were also the ones to point out the many mistakes in the Classic Demo that the devs didn't notice. 
---
Fair enough. I was an awkward teenager who had never played an MMO and was dragged into WoW by my girlfriend at the time. 
---
That  being said; you assuming I'm still that way means you can kindly go suck a whole bag of dicks. I didn't ask for your opinion about my personality I asked about gear progression and how to go about the transition. So you can take your "alpha tank" bullshit right back wherever you found it and go jack off over your BIS Excel sheet for all I care. 
---
Late July since 8.2 is in August
---
I clearly hope you plan to play 8/10 hours a day every day at least for rank 14 ;)
---
For pve... same for farming components! Good luck then
---
Yeah thats what i thought. A lot of people have holidays during that period so it wouldnt be wise to drop it later.
---
Wow, thanks
---
Will check it out! Would be most logical imo also 
---
The ultra cynic in me says they intentionally gave news of a 4 stage release plan so that later they could say "Hey look, 6 stages, we listened!" and get a PR win.
---
* 40% dmg reduction vs melee (w/ Voidy), 30% vs caster.
---
* Ability to do huge damage that cannot be interrupted.
---
* Heals, fears, silences, dispels, etc
---
Warlocks are ridiculously OP in end-game gear. The only real challenger is a Shadow Priest, for mostly the same reasons. Mages are hard-countered by both these classes.
---
Also, STV way to small. But who cares, it looks awesome.
---
&gt;that also happens to be a scientist IRL
---
Wow!!! An actual scientist!!! That means absolutely nothing but thank you so much for sharing that!!!
---
Probably, but I think people always like to have choices. Some might speak English whenever necessary, but might enjoy reading in their own language (Dutch, in this example), more. If it's a useless article you can feel free to tell me, but I had fun making it. And I hope someone enjoys it, at least.
---
Thanks :D
---
Just want you to tell us loot will be final and that you will **not** implement loot trading and that sharding is kept to a very limited time and only applied to starting zones and im happy.
---
You better not use sharding during AQ btw.
---
Also, please consider letting us atleast reskin the Blizzard launcher as the current "PLAY" button is soulless
---
Any need roll instantly soulbinding things would be the best addition to the loot system. 
---
It would solve so much drama. 
---
Bumping for interest
---
Live to Win!
---
Sure of course! Makes sense!
---
As bad as the system is, i think they should leave it the same.
---
I'll only get to rank 8 or 9 (maybe?) and i'll be happy with that :)
---
How do I get one? :P
---
Which is more or less what it should be as well. Yeah, MC was awesome.
---
Very cool of you to do man. I knew some dutch people who didn't speak English, I'm sure this'll be great for some people.
---
[This](https://youtu.be/wewnTYQfdR8?t=33) is basically the best rogue in vanilla WoW. Watch this duel several times and see what he has to do to win.
---
SL lock is absolutely disgusting.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhjsicCeVPw
---
They should of just let it happen, that is genius.
---
&gt; Warlocks are the most under-represented DPS.
---
i doubt that will be the case this time (1.12 talents), locks are pretty strong and everyone knows it
---
&gt;The guy you were talking to is a moron.
---
This
---
Hopefully they cater to people who don’t take a year to get to max level.
---
It's such a shame they killed him offscreen :(
---
He is still one of my favorite Warcraft characters.
---
I used to farm Hearthglen as a rogue, single target. I imagine this would be decent on a rogue too as you've mentioned.
---
Will this be updated now that DM is no longer part of the first wave?
---
Maybe a relaunch with changes that fixes the mistakes that happened during the expansion, it's a highly ambitious idea though and I can't see it happening.
---
Stuff like not having LFR, crossrealm gameplay, ilevel not taking off exponentially and other weird design choices. 
---
Rebirth on cool down.... I see this wasn’t a clean kill 😀

to make it a good AOE spec, you need to sacrifice some damage for 3/3 improved blizzard
---
Yeah, I remember attack speed is something like 3.6 or 3.8 seconds, so considering Aimed Shot's cast time is 3 secs, I see why you would only want to do that right after Auto Shot, and of course with the GCD there's no time to do any other kind of action.  I remember now!  But if you do mess up, at least moving or casting something merely delays Auto Shot instead of skipping it, right?  But I see how that adds up over time still.
---
Allience also has quests from there having them go to Alterac mountains. So they will be level 35-ish basically oneshotting people
---
1.12 talents from the start
---
False Alternative Fallacy? How can you legit jump from "i don't need this" to "therefor it's useless ?" You ignore the alternatives, it's not because you don't "need" something that it is all of a sudden useless. 
---
Like i said, if you read what i wrote, even if you don't need an item, it doesn't mean you don't want it. And some people want some things more than other. A loot that drops only in a particular dungeon that can not be done alone and you need to spend an hour to get and only drops 33% of the time (average 3 hours of gameplay) is way more important to the one who can equip it than to the other guy that would sell the item for 1g. (5 minutes of gameplay). 
---
Calling that they will put in sharding in the aq war effort and watch every1 defend them again.
---
Scarlet Monastary.
---
&gt; It wasn't really known about in classic so it wasn't a huge problem then. 
---
Thats just not true, i constantly grinded DM-wings on my priest. Back then you could do even DMW bosses solo.
---
And everyone CLAIMS they want no changes, wtf is nerfing gold grind then. It was a BIG part of the game. The people that put in the time, will always stay on top. You NEED inflation to drop the epix mount prices to something more reasonable.
---
No. I know I will never get R14 because I don't have the time and even if I would I wouldn't do it.
---
I am going to enjoy seeing R14s ingame and know that they have spent an ungodly amount of time for it though.
---
Oh, does it really count per person?  Interesting.  I never figured that out.  Okay, that is much more than I thought then.
---
About threat on refreshing, I was previously confident it only counts when Battle Shout/Demoralizing Shout/Roar is applied, meaning does no threat if it's already on targets, but now I feel like I can't be sure at all, lol.
---
More like flexing that Flask of the Titans 5 stack
---
Well I suppose the good news is I'm not going to ignore my blacksmithing this time around and furthermore am going to have a couple clothie alts to further supply my warrior with enchantments and potions. 
---
You really shouldn't need any more evidence to show that TBC was insanely popular than looking at the subscriber graph we've had for years; it was a steep climb during TBC and it plateaued in WotLK when they started to casualise the game. 
---
I also don't see how a re-release of a classic expansion is not objectively the most logical step to take after the re-release of a classic base game. 
---
If you're undead that won't turn you into a dwarf. The cross faction change would be NE.
---
I think It's a model swapper 3rd party program he's on about.
---
Good shout for anyone looking to do this legit in game tho. 
---
Thanks for your kind reply! I'm having a lot of fun trying to be an independent Dutch newsblog about gaming and entertainment. So yes, I'll continue writing and hope to help some folks!
---
What? Diablo 3 is a completely different game. The two things are nothing alike. The next logical step of a Diablo 2 remaster would be a Lord of Destruction remaster.
---
&gt;The thing is that no one actually "need" that item. 
---
You can go without additional extra 1k of gold too. But it seems a lot of people still A) want that and B) warriors keep on buying edgemasters because they are so great. 
---
You asked ;)
---
Ah okay, so it recharges all the time.  Good.  I assume the only time it's not recharging is if it's done and is waiting you to stop casting and/or stop moving for 0.5 secs.
---
That is way to slow, I mean BWL in 2020, even casual players that use 4 months to level and 2 months to clear molten core, will have nothing to do for 6 months.
---
Yep, this is how I did it. Spot on
---
Progressive talents is one of the dumbest ideas getting thrown around in this sub. 
---
Willingly making some class garbage for few months when everyone *knows* how it will change and what *will be good in the future*.
---
Same goes to the progressive itemization, really, to a lesser extend of course. But similar.
---
Oh my god the god damn gauntlet with the never ending respawning mobs inside ST that quest was the WORST.
---
Reading some other replies given to me, I see I slightly misread the message anyway.  But yeah, I can't believe I forgot for a moment about what Multi-Shot was like in Classic.
---
Was one of the first 100. FeelsGoodMan.
---
You fuckin tell him, buddy!
---
I don't think showtooltip was in the game in vanilla, but I do agree it was awesome.
---
Sorry to break to it you, but your defensiveness shows that you still aren't the kind of person that should be leading a party in an MMO.
---
Wat
---
Wanting something you don't need is greed. You are arguing my case for me. 
---
Ironic considering they are all for the progressive content patches even thought they won't be mirroring the original order at all... Guess double standards live on.
---
I was on an rp server. So we created our own stories.
---
I'm also a seasoned fisher, so my goal is to compete in the fishing competition. 
---
He should do what he does great. The lore videos, dungeon walkthroughs and so on. He does not know or understand the entire game, yet he acts as such. Exactly the reasoning for why he wont vanish is why it is problematic that he creates videos with straight up false statements.
---
I had a macro that would cast seduce, silence, sacrifice depending on what pet you had out, later on it had a cast on focus target if holding alt, I don't remember if it was an addon or if it was early tbc that gave the focus functionality though.
---
If you never did Westfall, you should do Westfall. It's an Alliance rite of passage. The huge Defias questline starting in Sentinel Hill takes you through the zone, Deadmines, the Stockade, up to Stormwind keep, and you get some amazing loot along the way. 
---
I'd say do Darkshore until \~17 then hop on a few boats. 
---
War rogue hunter arent in high demand
---
Do priests farm well without respec?
---
Cant wait for the shitshow to start when people realise how trash vanilla is by todays standars
---
Alliance obviously, gotta trigger those edgelords with my NE Warrior and Shadowmeld.
---
Post your armory profile once you created it, to be able to follow up ;)

What do you mean if? There definitely will be. 
---
Reduce GCD, increase spirit form walking speed, increase reputation gain 
---
But its not beautiful though.
---
Seems like a cool macro, hope it will work with the macro system of Classic, do you still have a copy somewhere ? 
---
I think it has to do with how you perceive your character.
---
It's your "flesh and blood" that you have painstakingly leveled all the way from level 1, no shortcuts, no paid boosts etc. It has been through a lot.
---
On the way you picked up some scraps of gear, spoils of victory from the creatures, bosses and quests you had to overcome, and they show the status of your character.
---
It helps immerse you more into the world and your character, because most of your gear has been earned by overcoming some type of challenge, which puts a bit of history into every piece.
---
Then you stand infront of your biggest challenge yet, which happens to be one of the level 60 raid bosses, with your hard earned gear and hard earned levels, and you can't help but to feel a bit in awe on how far you've come, on the cusp of greatness.
---
This is why you hear people talking about certain items fondly, how they saved "useless" gear in their bank over the years. It's a piece of their old character, and those pieces of gear tell the lore of the characters.
---
Spot on!
---
Since Wow Classic will use the Legion macro system, I'm pretty sure #showtooltip will work. Am I wrong ?  
---
This thread is disheartening. Loot is there to be used, so need. Greed is for money, Vendor or AH.
---
I'd try to talk about it, then wait to see what group does. If they greed so am I. If they need, I'm needing to give the warrior a better chance. If we both loose such a rare and amazing peice of gear for the one who put in the work to see it drop, that sucks balls, and I move on probably blocking the needers after the run.
---
From my own experience in Vanilla, the people who rolled need for gold were fine until it was their BiS, then they hated it.
---
Doing Sunken Temple in Vanilla feels like some sort of Zelda dungeon
---
Please go read a dictionary because that's not the definition of greed.
---
For mages like that I always had the flame reflector disk on my resto druid. Sure I lost out of other stats but was always fun as hell watching the mage kill himself.
---
That's true, but looking over the wowhead description of said item, it says that it was "Added in patch 1.11.1.5462"
---
Am I wrong in assuming that it's one of the items that won't be included then? I specifically remember this chestpiece wasn't obtainable on the private servers with progressive itemization.
---
Definition of greed
---
: a selfish and excessive desire for more of something (such as money) than is needed
---
I have a few questions regarding the differences of classic and current wow.
---
1.) How does classic differ from cataclysm-BFA? Do professions matter? Are things like LW and BS useful in terms of getting useful gear/items, not gold. 
---
2.) I hear it took a long time to level in classic but was the leveling challenging, was group play encouraged? 
---
Whatever. I took your words about the subject of myself 15 years ago in stride and then called you out for being an asshole for no reason. Have fun in the race to 60. I hope you roll on a PVP server like all the other elitest try hard garbage so I never have to play with you.
---
I sympathize, but as you said you can't please everyone, I personally WANT to struggle through MC, and the longer it is between content cycles the better from a PVP standpoint, class balance was at its best pre AQ.
---
The old client was easily manipulated and one reason why private servers are not ideal. You can drop WOD textures and Legion textures in the mpq and edit it etc and not get banned. China farmers do that with certain herbs and put giant freakin pillars of light on their spawns.  Not the case anymore and 64 bit and the new client has put a stop to a lot of injection and things like Tmorph.  They put a stop to it because it allowed worse things which were becoming rampant that hurt things like Arena. There is always going to be people doing it or trying in some fashion but the new solutions can lose your account and they are very buggy compared to the old Tmorph by Toto and usually broken. He works with the Blizzard esports team now. 
---
TLDR use in game methods. Another one people aren't mentioning that is Alliance only is you can get a furlbog rod in a quest chain in Ashenvale. If I remember right you just don't finish the chain. It stays with you. I used it on a dwarf rogue on Nostalrius often cus I hate the Dwarf animations. It was the only and last time I will ever play Alliance. The furlbog thing was hilarious though. It drops when you get hit but as a rogue you can prevent that often and troll the heck out of people.

---
my lack of trust isnt with the blizz devs delivering a good classic game design. my lack of trust is with the activision managers not letting their greed ruin the game
---
True! Fun to see!
---
No. It would be like saying the next logical step to Diablo 3 remastered would be to have Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls remastered. 
---
Most likely a [Hoop Earring](https://www.wowhead.com/item=9355/hoop-earring) which drops from the mobs that he's killing
---
You could really use some self-reflection, dude.
---
&gt;I just feel like 3 months of no-lifing it in this day and age is kind of a bad thing to push
---
But this isn't a game from this day and age. It's a 15 years old game, that Blizzard didn't want to push. *We* wanted to push it. *We* wanted this game. 
---
I know you're just looking for a better system, but it really feels like what you're saying is "I don't have time for R14 the way my life is right now; change it so I do." 
---
I know that's probably not your main goal here, but that's what it comes across as. 
---
We're getting Classic, and in Classic WoW R14 was a grind. That's how it should remain. 
---
Might be a dumb question, but would you be able to get the dreadsteed warlock mount before phase 2 or no?
---
I wouldn't refer to wowhead about anything, tbh.
---
Savage Gladiator was in from early in the game. It just got a lot of updates over the course of vanilla.
---
When I played on a private server I used the [Darkmantle Tunic](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22009/darkmantle-tunic) and the [Darkmantle Cap](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22005/darkmantle-cap)
---
However I'm fairly sure that the energy proc rate was too high on private servers, which made these items shoot up in value. They're awesome for people who can't obtain T2 though.
---
I wish I did, that computer is long since toast, although I wonder if they are saved to your character on bnet, might be able to recover them when I resub for classic.
---
I'll likely never set foot in a raid, too much life going on these days (and non-gamer GF). Still, this is awesome news! Setting foot in Mara for the first time (again) is going to be like stepping into a warm pair of [Felheart Slippers].
---
I have no idea, I didn't think they had confirmed anything about the macro system
---
Oh god, I saw this table before, read the first few rows and assumed that they meant 1-6 is done in 43 minutes.
---
I thought that was fast as fuck because I tried myself and need around 50 minutes.
---
I mean the point I'm trying to make is that it's pushes unhealthy lifestyle  and is a relic of gaming and should probably remain like that.
---
I'm totally fine with only a few players getting a reward I just think maybe the system should be looked at because 1 it's not good and 2 it's just not healthy at all. 
---
Oh, hell yes!!!
---
There's a massive difference between needing on 1 item that changes your game experience and needing a hundred times on small items.
---
The R14 on my server was a druid as well actually. A *balance* druid even, can you imagine? 
---
I'm not really sure what makes you think mages or warlocks are in any higher demand than warriors and rogues or even hunters...
---
Surely they are less popular classes but they are also subpar damage dealers in raids for the majority of the game and the competition for a raid slot is very real since there is no real incentive to bring more than a couple of each, while stacking warriors and rogues is very beneficial.
---
Casters will likely lag behind in damage until late AQ/early Naxx which are stages 5 and 6, that will be at minimal a year after release. Hunters at least buff melees with their aura and wolf in the early stages of the game.
---
Sure, Lock has the luxury of keeping the same build for all game modes so you save on respecs, but doesn't check the "in demand for raids" box imo.
---
In vanilla, I thought they were temporary items that only lasted about 15 minutes when you logged out. 
---
I certainly could be wrong though. 
---
As could you. Your attitude towards a video game to the point that you'll lob personal criticisms based on a decade plus old anecdote is unbefitting a properly adjusted human being. But hey; the beauty of the internet is that you can always find a group of people that feel just like you. And I hope you do. I really, truly do.
---
I've always been partial to Cowmooflage
---
Subpar or not u gonna need a bunch of them for curses
---
Whoooosh
---
&gt;The real question is does he deserve it more than me ? And the answer is no because it's a world loot, it was absolute sheer luck that the item dropped he didn't do anything more than me to deserve the item.
---
This is the only salient point. Everyone did the same work for it. Every gets the same chance at it.
---
If i wanna play as elemntal shaman pvp in the endgame, ,how do i aquire spellcasting gear if I'm going to  heal in dungeon/raids?
---
Well the Classic demo showed the used macro system and Blizzard confirmed that they will use a modern build for their client (the legion one). But yeah I dont think it was directly confirmed I guess. 
---
Help us get r/classic_shaman going!  I posted the video there a few days ago. 
---
I want to see them go the OSRS route BUT somehow keep it optional by keeping some servers in vanilla condition forever.
---
I want to see them go an alternate route, not go into TBC.
---
Keep the cap at 60, but add content such as, mount hyjal, caverns of time, azshara crater etc.
---
The possibilities are endless, however they should never ever add anything going against the spirit of vanilla (resilience etc). Itemization might be a challenge after Nax, but it’s solveable.
---
1-10, imo. Until you get to zone 2. 1-20 is too much.
---
Faction imbalance, playing with twitch chat-ers, one big guild centered around the streamer, a good portion of the population just following the  streamer and doing their "events" rather than playing with others in the world, etc.
---
True, I don't think we can take that as a fact though considering how many other things were wrong in the beta build.
---
It doesn't necessarily mean anything but the chance of it being reliable is a lot higher than if a 12 year old kid that just hit level 60 said it.
---
I know i'd never get rank 14 regardless of any changes they'd make, that's not my issue with it.  It's a similar reason I dislike loot boxes and want them out of games, for certain people it will push out a really unhealthy / not sustainable lifestyle.
---
I mean overall I don't think it'd be the end of the world if maybe they changed it to MMR (or something better different, i haven't put in much thought to a different system), that would still reward the single top of the leaderboard person, could still have time played matter, but not make the only way of attaining it be 3 months of doing nothing but playing WoW.
---
I don't want more grandmarshalls / warlords, I don't want it easier, I just want something more sustainable from a real life aspect.  It's more so that I'm concerned about people who may become a little to invested in this unhealthy game-play loop if that makes sense to you.
---
I know some things will be changed and some things should be changed, and to me this is definitely one of them, if they keep it at the same level of exclusivity but remove the unhealthy grinding nature of it I think it'd be better for everyone. 
---
That's what I read and got excited for. Items didn't get THAT much changed in the 1.10 patch, it was just the new gear that was so much better because of the new itemization.
---
So for me, it's good enough =)!
---
Exalted... so much time
---
https://youtu.be/szkScab2iOQ
---
&gt;Hearthglen's mines
---
TIL Hearthglen has mines
---
Well stated.
---
Gives armour and crit too, pretty key for prot warriors. Agi shouldn’t be underestimated on them.
---
These boots are on plenty of pre-raid BiS lists for prot. They’re good and sell for a lot.
---
Elemental is best the last 15 or 20 levels. Remember he did these tests in the 50's, and for what it's worth, on a private server. 
---
Before you get all your talents, elemental will probably be pretty inefficient. 
---
These new Druid forms are looking good.
---
Yeah they should either create the patches as they were or have the game in true 1.12 state. Not this weird mix that will create metas that never even existed. 1.12 without access to items from 1.10 will for instance make physical dps absurdly overpowered compared to casters. Perhaps even so overpowered that bringing casters is not worth even for utility. 
---
Too bad it was not buffed with water walking before jumping :D
---
Gnomes deserve it!
---
Gait? Kappa
---
You can see he looted mageweave cloth and shit after the boots dropped, and he only has 2 bags open, so I would assume he does have space actually and just wanted to get the screenshot first
---
Elemental does the most damage but that doesn't mean it's the best.
---
True! He also has a slot available in the bag!
---
I still have my rod on retail. Used it throughout Legion raids when I played for a few months. Awesome. 
---
I think combining elemental with 2h earthbind kiting is the way to go. I’m killing 15+ mobs without drinking at 43 atm.
---
Feels like you pasted that only taking into account the " desire for more of something (such as money) than is needed "  and absolutely ignoring the "a selfish and excessive desire "
---
Need. Blizzard need/greed system did not take into account items worth more than epic mounts.
---
It works fine for BoP and blues  under &lt;50g or so (even that's pushing it), but not for BoE's worth 1000g.
---
They made it BoE for a reason after all. One persons' BiS is another person's BiS on the AH or another person's insta-epic mount. Lottery items = everyone has a chance to win imo.
---
I mean for instance razergore is no doubt harder in PS than vanilla. The warrior kite method straight does not work and he hits harder than in OG.
---
PS for a good month or so don't allow any word buffs in raids when they first come out. Making the game easier only lowers the player pools because its faster to fly through content.
---
wowhead came out around 1.11. That's the earliest release date it has for items on there. Originally the Savage Gladiator chain had defence on it I think, before being changed to the monster it is known as. 
---
I would definitely highly respect you. I'd do it for items worth 50g or so, just to make a good impression, but 1000g item = dozens of hours of grinding. I do not find it worth giving away 25h of my time just to make somebody I know happy. I hope you will respect that too ;-)
---
150-250 hours
---
I count 3 months to lvl up from 1 to 60 in wow classic
---
You say filled but those are literally the only 2 on there right now.  And technically Destiny isn't even Activision anymore.
---
Same. That shit was way too long and boring 
---
To anyone criticizing that the macro system is unknown: we can still put the macros together and get pretty damn close, simply eliminating the ones that end up not working.
---
Anyone have a list of items affected that I can cheat off of?
---
I do think that it’s part of the vanilla experience but I feel like this is just a decent QOL addition. They’ve made it quite clear at this point that it isn’t going to be identical to vanilla also so maybe it isn’t so bad. 
---
Plus if you meet someone who’s playing on a different server you always have the option to play with them and enjoy the game more overall, because that’s just how classic was meant to be played 
---
Quite in depth explaination, mind elaborating ?  
---
I like vanilla, but at some point I just put my rose-tinted glasses down and tried to look at it without nostalgia.
---
I personally like his videos 👍🏻 dont know why ppl hit others so easily, you guys dont have to watch them ....
---
If you are in a dungeon and staff of jordan drops I don't want to hear this crap about it being an "upgrade" the amount of damage/stats that item provides by itself is neglible and it will be replaced shortly after 60 and you find comparable items before then. For the price it isn't worth equipping an expensive twink item like that. So 99% boe drops fall in that category.
---
Edgemasters are not the same in that they arent getting replaced ever or not for a very very long time, so if a warrior needs I might pass. The same rules apply though in general, all need for the boe.
---
I thought they were all sacked?
---
My friend had a warrior called Cownan
---
enchanters need all the greeded loot, give it to them?
---
No focus target in vanilla. Some ui mods have added a ui element for /focus (like pfui), but dont think you can use it in a target macro.
---
Hopefully 👍🏻 that way we dont have to worry about all the tourists.
---
I leveled my shaman with dagger and shield windfury. I never used shocks or anything besides totem or heal. I purposely didnt spec stormstrike, instead went further down resto. Never needed to drink from 30 to 60. Reached 60 in 9 days played.  
---
My goal was to make an auto attack spec while I watched tv
---
Yeah, naxx went past me as well, much of the stuff is similiar to LK naxx I believe, which was alright for the time. Classic naxx was mindlessly overtuned though, gotta check some numbers, but there was a dot which did pretty much the same damage in both expansions and stuff like that. Only a minor difference of roughly 10-15k hp though haha.
---
Which breaks your point, since you *need* the money. I need 1000g for an epic mount. It's NOT more than is needed. It's probably even less than is needed.
---
Oh dear, questing at night in the Barrens.
---
You're planning on playing for 224 hours at launch and not "wasting" time doing other stuff? You can get to 60 in that time, even as a noob. 
---
But I'd really suggest taking it down a step. Unless you *really* want to be in Molten Core in the first month with the elite, you're going to miss a lot of the fun of the journey and might even burn out playing something as arduous as a warrior for that long straight. There's not going to be many other players at 60 that quickly, so your endgame options are going to be quite limited. 
---
Although if you want to MT at endgame, getting to 60 in 2 weeks shows the dedication needed, I guess, and you can take the MT spot in a guild before anyone else has a chance.

Man, give the dude a break. What sort of trash community flames someone for not knowing specific mechanics or whether or not they did the end game 15 years ago. He makes video on vanilla content, why must he have certain 'qualifications' for doing so? Just don't watch his vids if they don't appeal to you.  
---
Almost some shit outta r/gatekeeping  
---
Lmao you think this kind of thing never happened in vanilla?   
---
This is authentic 
---
Yep been saying this since Blizzcon but people just enjoy complaining
---
Equipping items by their names is waste of time. You can just slap that weapon in a ui button slot and use it in the macro. Makes life a LOT easier while levelup when you change your weapon quite often. Just drop the new weapon into the ui button bar and your macro works.
---
Examples i use all the time:
---
\- warrior general aoe macro that does WW on berserkers, cleave on other stances.
---
\- 3x charge macros that change stance based on if you are in combat. Thats bound on each stance on same button. 
---
\- You can make very complicated dps/tanking rotation one button macros that you can just bound to mouse wheel and spam that. These usually have things like "if you have less than 25 rage, use bloodrage, if not battleshout use it, if target sunder != 5, use sunder, else use this attack1, attack2, attack3" type of structure. These might be obsolite in classic.
---
Never bothered with such complicated stuff, i do have basic priority tank rotation macro button if shit hits the fan. It equips certain 1h+shield, def stance, starts building threat.
---
On like on pally i have ZG trinket pop + crit talent + biggest heal in one button. Its nice since trinket and that crit talent have same cd.
---
yeah vanilla private servers are empty
---
i mean nostalrius? wtf was that? i think peak pop was like 100 people...definitely no interest in classic wow
---
Will there be WoW Tokens in Classic?
---
hypothetically if a caster item worth 5k gold drops you let it go even if the item is a 2% dps upgrade but you wouldnt have to farm for ANYTHING until naxx or later? If the warrior earned that winning lotto ticket fine, but he didn't, the group did.
---
I see where you are coming from but honestly, whats the big deal between warriors and druids ? Druids get a little more damage due to beeing crushable and crittable, no blocking makes tanking a lot of stuff a lot more painful, but threat is really good. Warrior have 2 oh-shit buttons, AoE threat is pretty bad unless thunderfury.  
---
As a DD, I just dps after 2-3 globals and thats it, no matter who is standing there, be it a druid, warrior, pally or even shaman haha.
---
\------------------  
---
I feel like the whole difference approach to the classes would be more nuanced if they've had more skills with higher impact. Like bloodlust / Heroism, shockwave for warrior or spellreflect, not sure about druids but maybe frenzied regen ?  
---
It's mostly a tank problem though, I think they're quite samey. Rest of the cast is a bit better.  
---
But there are still some specs that don't have a real purpose, like elemental shamans, that offer nothing more compared to resto shamans.
---
You borrow most of the stuff from another warlock who already paid so it ends up costing about 400g
---
Mained rogue in vanilla and had 2 RL buddies who mained warriors.  Demo shout has always removed rogues from stealth.  We did a lot of duels back then and blood rage/demoshout was basically their only way to try and counter a rogue opener.
---
That's because a 12 year-old hasn't encountered high school math yet. Any cock who went to school can become a scientist. It's not special, and it's not required to do math. You're only trying to shill yet another "content creator" basement ape who dreams of making money without working like an adult.
---
Darnassus is one of the easier reps to grind since they have so many quests. 
---
Careful, it's illegal to sell other peoples trademarks, you need permission from Blizzard. Or just keep low
---
Took me 11 or so days on my very first character.
---
Do you really wamt to grind wintersaber rep without a fast mount though? That run down to the giants took forever!
---
I want a new Kilrogg! 
---
I'm of 2 minds about this.
---
changing hair/skin color dont bother me and blizz can cash in on those, they are cosmetic only.
---
I'm more against changing race(faction) than Jared Taylor and name changes I am against for obvious raisins.
---
So, do  i  need to havee BFA  in order to have acccess to vanilla servers? 
---
hmm I disagree. Finishing stuff in a grey zone is basicly no pregression, therefore not really attractive for me. Leveling as it is takes enough time, no real reason to waste some more of it.  
---
And I personally played all DS games due to wanting a chalange, not rub my wood while killing early stuff. Aside from that, once max level, your power grows exponantionally while mobs get only slightly tougher, so you can still slaughter everything to your hearts content, not even mentioning going back to old xpacs and unleashing your destrucive power if desperately needed.
---
I think you're forgetting how addicting WoW Classic is in general. People are always going to do nothing but play WoW, it's just the nature of the game. Especially Classic.
---
R14 is hardly the biggest problem if you're looking for unhealthy gameplay loops in WoW. Everything about the game encourages playing 10 hours a day every day.
---
It really doesn't matter. All I'm saying is that I'd rather listen to someone that studied math than that 12 years old. I never said that he was some kind of genius.
---
I have fantisized about an "alternate" timeline way forward. Allows them to do content at different rates and change things altogether. Hell it could even go from WoW classic into a new MMO.
---
I agree, but it really depends on how quickly they go to each phase. If it's somewhat fast then I'd rather the no-lifers get a bit of time with their gear before it gets surpassed.
---
What world are you living in where everyone sees everything the day you post it?
---
Me and my friends (Horde) would regularly raid the Deeprun Tram, rushing into it and claiming it, killing anyone flagged who roams inside. Eventually we'd attract enough attention to have a few alliance come to clear us out. 
---
We'd then jump on the next tram and a few alliance would make it on with us, but not all. We'd kill those few that made it on the journey or force them to jump off to save themselves. 
---
Eventually we would attract too much attention and we would rush out into Stormwind or iron forge and make a last stand, usually in the large hall near the Stormwind entrance to the tram.
---
I always felt like I've done something wrong, like, I should've gone somewhere else, more appropriatley for my level. But yeah, finishing a zone was an accomplishment, but it still feels that way today tbh, despite not taking that much time.
---
Most people hit level 10 within 2 hours if they are rushing. 3 or 4 if you are slacking and that is without a lot of competition on private servers. Do you think populatoon density will really have spread out much by level 10, 2 hours after launch? I think sharing until level 20 seems reasonable
---
And by the way? Why would I care if he makes a living off of this? I enjoy his content so I watch it, if he makes a living off of it that means he can make more content that I can watch.
---
Sounds like a good idea! But leveling 2 classes, pheww. Quite an investment, as I don't know how long I'll stay anyway. But I'll just wait and see :)
---
They should, but they wont.  
---
Modern WoW has worse graphics.
---
Troll for PvE and Orc for PvP.
---
Or just pick based on looks, sole reason I dont play Tauren or Dwarf hunters.
---
What gun is that?
---
Nope. Once we get into the raiding scene, we laugh at pallies running around in a mix of weird  cloth dresses while they cry casting 5 minute buffs 40 times in a row all the time.
---
Awwww yiss! 
---
And how did you grow back in the day ? 95% of quest gear was bad, many people hit 60 with blues from their 40s. Every level up you'd need to go back to a trainer and alll the way back to your quest location for some improvement if at all.  
---
I feel like growth wasn't really a thing, or only over a bigger level bracket. 10 levels or something like that, which takes longer than going trough all leveling content in BFA, after which you can have your power increase, not to mention that you get stronger during leveling as well. More damage, more health, more stats. Enemies grow as well though, but the illusion works quite well for me.
---
Wtf lol no there isnt. You either raid or PVP. There is NOTHING outside of that.
---
probably the hordes i saw there yesterday.
---
WHEN ITS RED ITS DEAD!!!
---
Hi, /u/Das_Momo
---
Being a spell was awesome in WoD, pop kiljaedans cunning and caat it whilst running! It was even castable whilst gliding down from EotS spawn or AB LM.
---
I weirdly loved PvP as a lock in late WoD...
---
Heart of the Wild / Nature’s Swiftness.
---
(Deep feral with restoration)
---
I would like this too. But i know for a fact all t0 set bonuses were changed over time.
---
Once you get full Naxx gear you're going to be doing enough damage to mean a lot of surprise fights are going to end quickly enough that the answer really depends on what you're doing.
---
Rogues IMO are always kings of world PvP just because you can choose your fights. They still are really powerful and a good rogue with the element of surprise can win a lot of fights though I'm sure they lose some.
---
World PvP but just all sorts of crazy fights I think frost mage might be the best. You can get your health up and the skill cap is quite high. You probably have some weaknesses but you're quite deadly.
---
Duels are probably SL warlock.
---
I need to kill someone right now and I don't care about anything else (ie WSG flag carrier) is POM/Pyro mage. Even pre Naxx when my guild ran into a real turtle we'd get a mage or two swapped in and just insta kill whoever under pretty much any circumstance.
---
Always in a group (ie with a healer) is definitely warrior. AQ/Naxx geared warrior with a druid or paladin is pretty much ridiculous and I won plenty of 3-5 vs 2s with a druid when I was in BWL/AQ gear and Sulfuras.
---
The cynics he refers to are likely the ones who believe it wouldn't be changed at all
---
I care
---
Quests are the same stupid blizzard quests as always, you're really over exaggerating there. 
---
"Read this text written by the developers and not a story lead"
---
"okay now kill 5 humans, come back, I'll tell you to go kill another human for a ring"
---
Feral druid, it can do everything, and there's even a hybrid feral/healing build which isn't pretty but can get the job done.
---
Guild called Taurential Reign 
---
Sharding *on launch* for a limited time and/or limited number of levels is a good thing.
---
Yeah you would get news and updates on it frequently, it was helpful.
---
If we can have this much people in one place at the starting zones, I'll say sharding isn't doing much damage (unless there were a few guys right there alone sharded lol).
---
On AQ40 content in private servers, we use 5 or 6 pallys. 4-5 priests and 2 druids.
---
You need 5 to get all the buffs.... kings, might/bow, salv, light and sanctuary. 
---
Pallys are VERY strong in healing, their only weakness is massive aoe damage, like vicidious. Priest is just more all around healer, when you have fast heals, slow heals, hots and aoe. But nothing compares to hpally spam where you wont go oom.
---
It's a pain yes. Only upside is that the healing mobs are not damaging you while they heal, so if you keep them on the edge, they will be more busy healing themselves than other stuff.
---
On my druid, I tended to ensure I had full energy and 3 combo points loaded and then unleash burst dps when they are at 1/3 health and the healing starts.
---
Horde will go there around level 20-24 depending on the class. Alliance will go there around 30-34, to do the quests in the south of the zone. Then go to Alterac Mountains which entails running north and south several times, crossing the path of the horde running east to west between Terran Mill and Hillsbrad fields.
---
Even if there is no intent to run into the horde. Alliance players will inevitably do so.
---
If are wondering if it's possible to learn this type of power. Not from a Sin'dorei. Only through the teachings of Raene Wolfrunner can you wield such power.
---
The Alliance is a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural. 
---
Itll be a giant failure for other reasons.
---
I'm not talking about itemization, I'm talking about will it drop or will it not.  
---
Itemization isn't affected
---
Right click reporting is not really a big deal imo
---
Your words have been marked and your punishment will be severe if you hype us and it fails &gt;:( 
---
Nice rundown :D
---
Also, learn to die. If you are running a dungeon. And accidentally pull 58 packs instead the one you were supposed to. Please, die alone. Ill ress you after.
---
At level 10, you have more/bigger provinces to spread to, so it's lwss of a problem though.
---
But he’s already in defensive stance. He’ll do just fine.
---
this is why i roll a human female rather than a human male
---
I can assure you that both factions do this.
---
Dynamic respawns is changing the availability of items in the game way way way beyond classic, it will break the economy and gearing curve massively. 
---
Shard the starter zones - simple solution. Don't fuck with anything else past the first 10 levels. 
---
Well, I mean, because they already have a game with a load of X-Pacs as it is. If they're just going to eventually get back to where the game is now... What's the point? I just want to know where it should stop is all. And having a game with only content that everyone that will play HAS played, kinda limits it's lifetime. 
---
Why do you hate flying mounts so much. I actually liked them because you and a gang of lvl 70 could fly searching for 60-69 players and gank them easier than in vanilla. Since only lvl 70 got flying. People Who say it kills world pvp clearly havent entered Isle of quel'danas. It was the pvp hotspot. 
---
I always love how you put out all the fires, turn in the quests and as soon as a new character is created they already need help to put out the fires again. Everything we do to safe Azeroth is in vain.
---
Perhaps I’m just out of the loop, but are you referring to loot trading as it currently is in Live? I keep seeing loot trading and I’m not exactly clear on what that means. 
---
On pservers you will absolutely see more legendaries than R14. Honor is capped at a sertan amount to the entire server, the higher the pop the more competition you will have for the same price. Legendary items are just very low drop items, higher pop means more chances for those items to drop.
---
I do remember that the furlbog wand haha. Thanks for that, this was informative.
---
it's in, it was once changed in 1.7, then again in 1.10
---
I look forward to never doing this instance again.
---
thats not nax gear. is like T2 ish?
---
Does the meta change at nax gear?
---
Het voelt een beetje ongemakkelijk wanneer je 'chill' gebruikt in zo'n officieel nieuwsbericht. Verder een geweldig stuk!
---
Naw, not a massive disadvantage. They're not stat sticks like ranged weapons are. Relics are just stuff like "Increases Lightning Bolt damage by 33." or, "Increases Flash of Light healing by 53."  
---
They're super nice to have, don't get me wrong, but nothing game breaking.
---
Race and faction changes bother me. Name, realm and appearance changes don't.
---
You know what you couldn't do in Isle of Quel'Danas? Fly. Just let that sink in lol
---
You can be the winters chill mage in aoe spec but once aq comes out youll go fire and wont be able to aoe farm as you once did
---
&gt;It gives you the opportunity to finish the quest lines
---
Since leveling takes way longer in vanilla you also have time to finish all the quest lines. You'll also be go into different zones that are of the same level-range simply because the quests in one zone aren't enough. I would say what you SHOULD worry about is running out of quests rather than missing out on them. 
---
You'll also be doing quests for the rewards too and being able to solo a couple of difficult now-green quests is pretty nice. They also give plenty of xp.
---
Druids are not in high demand.
---
Will Blizzard put in a ranged slot when they know it's going to be removed further down the line? Probably not. We'll likely just see empty slots until phase 5. 
---
Classic is as classic does. 
---
Stat is my personal favorite. The atmosphere was *awesome*.
---
What? How is the loch bigger than dun murough? Most races have their starting zone joined with another races around 10. Or by multiples in Barrens. 
---
I mean it's something they could do and the game would be better for it.  I'd be more excited about jumping into BC pvp because of MMR.
---
Having this kind of grind pvp system should stay back in the past, it shouldn't be brought back.
---
I'm a complete noob at Vanilla. Could someone tell me why this is such good news?
---
Why no server change at some point?
---
I
---
I agree with you, full-on progressive itemization is a very player-hostile system that also fucks over casters. What you're suggesting is a pretty decent compromise. Out of curiosity have you seen some blue post confirming that's what they are doing, since the only reference I've so far seen from them is the line item of loot revamp in phase 5.
---
Or when you follow Joana's guide and it tells you to go STVietnam at level 30.
---
No questions just make it an addon
---
It would make server reputation completely redundant. It someone wanted to, they could ninja loot, change server (and name if the name is taken) without any repercussions.
---
What you do here, is you get the Egan's Blaster for the ranged slot.
---
How the hell do you pronounce Furbolg
---
Bedankt voor de feedback!
---
True... last time I did it in cat form... 
---
We'll see. I will get the furbolg trinket first, then the saber.
---
If only there was a forum of like minded people who too are interested in classic wow
---
A few days is not nearly enough, the community will need at least 1 month to organise.
---
It gets even more favoured towards Warlock.
---
Barrens/silverpine are the main ones, sure (I am a horde exclusive so not sure about the alliance, sorry!) But then there are more you can go into at level 12 or so. In populated servers I would go to Stonetalon mountains and Ashenvale and would mostly have an easy time.
---
Server change is blizzlike IIRC.
---
REEEEEEEE ONLY HARDCORE PLAYERS ALLOWED, YOU BETTER NOT THINK ABOUT PLAYING IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED VANILLA OR HAVEN'T AT LEAST LEVELED 20 CHARACTERR TO 60 ON PRIVATE SERVERS
---
Lol. Without 1.10 and ZG items warlock sucks. You have 83% chance to hit the boss. Because melee has everything in 1.12 state the bosses still go down quick so the resist streaks in short fights will be devastating. Over infinitely long fight 83% hit wouldn't be so bad but in a fight where you can cast 10 shadow bolts and 5 are resisted it is pretty bad.
---
I still remember that staff of conjuring, the one that made level 5 food. I used to poke fun at my mage friend to say that anyone can conjure if they have a magic stick.
---
There's no way to make faction change work and not piss off paladin/shaman players so it's pretty safe to say it won't be a thing.
---
I miss how capes looked in this game. I play Warframe and like 80% of the capes are like the things of capes. Also they have no stats. It's really sad. 😞
---
Doubt it. With the knowledge we have now I imagine there will be a huge increase in the number of strong classes compared to what there originally would have been. 
---
Alliance Priests will go Dwarf. 
---
Likely more Warriors in general (either because they know tanks are needed or because high end dps is great).
---
Same for Mage or Lock for casters.
---
Hunters/rogues for farm characters.
---
It was added in the very tail end of vanilla and a highly controversial addition, same with cross-realm battlegrounds. Any cross-realm feature that was in vanilla needs to be re-examined as to whether it was really a wise decision, really. And as far as I'm concerned, the answer to that question is "No" in all cases.
---
dont forget the shaman dude.
---
I’m glad there’s a seriously challenging raid at the end of the road in vanilla :)
---
Moochiocowku
---
Named after Michio Kaku
---
Moopheus 
---
Named after Morpheus
---
Well, thats your opinion.
---
What? It makes no sense. How does "DM" for Dire Maul make sense anyway? At least you would say someyhing like DM All sections or the like.
---
And it's not like the change was universal, no one through the european gateway changed the abbreviation for deadmines. 
---
Make Deadmines Great Again.
---
I enjoy having some bag space tho =)) lmao
---
or you could just do a good spec for your mage.
---
The Barrens was also a nightmare for the releases of 2 of the latest f r e s h servers
---
3 races converged there and a lot of undead went there anyway, it was a mess really
---
Plus a lot of these servers added dynamic spawning in response to the pops, which is a pretty bad idea imo
---
They use dynamic spawns instead
---
I'll never understand Blizzard "improving" things by removing content. What was the point of cutting down a dungeon that wasn't part of progression anymore? 
---
Classic isn't something you want to rush with. It isn't like retail where all the fun is in the last 10 levels of the current expansion. The fun is packed into all 60 levels with classic.
---
have to drop piercing ice huh? well 6% cant matter that much
---
That depends on how fast I'll reach level 24!
---
I'm talking specifically about vanilla BG titles, like it legit doesn't matter what you guys say to me I transferred my warrior and lost my title. 
---
As an Alliance player. This is how I feel about STV.
---
Have hope!  We were all in our 30's when this picture was taken :) 
---
No, the only thing required will be a subscription. 
---
Classic is something where OP can do whatever he wants
---
It changes the gold per hour quite a bit to end up being less efficient than other farming methods
---
Also gear in inventory can still take a death durability hit, at least it did in some pservers
---
gotta miss the good ol vent days 
---
\+1 for use of the word "galleons"
---
They don'e belong in Classic WoW, though.
---
LOL.  Let's just say we were not leet at this point in the game.  We did all eventually go on to clear MC, BWL, and (most of) AQ40 in another guild.
---
not really reliant on naxx gear but imo shaman is the strongest class for pvp overall. their only weakness is horrible sustain, but thats not relevant for pvp anyway.
---
I think this a bullshit answer. The people with time to waste are the entitled ones, not the people who seek to have content obtainable. They feel they should be rewarded simply for having more time to play than everyone else.
---
Rank gear is the only gear in the game that is gated by consecutive time invested. Not time invested. Not skill. Consecutive time. It's not something you can put 1000 hours into over a year and wind up with the gear. If you don't put in more consecutive time than other players then you simply won't get it.
---
I can't think of any other content in any other game that has this gating. 
---
remember when there used to be men with thick skin in this world? pepperidge farm remembers.....
---
The vanilla experience had like a total of 200k accounts made at launch, with presumably less characters than that, spread out through servers and starting areas and with people having zero clue what to do for the most part
---
Nowadays the knowledge is different, the hype seems to indicate that 200k is a pretty low estimate and there's the issue with tourists and dead servers, the craziness that are private servers aren't remotely close to what vanilla was to be fair
---
Wasn't crossrealm related to TBC prep? Nobody is saying TBC talent calcs should be in the game tho.
---
My wife was alch/herb so I got the potion love!
---
Yeah, silverpine isnt nearly as good as barrens except for competition
---
Grasping at straws here I think.
---
[https://discord.gg/3cmM9Zs](https://discord.gg/3cmM9Zs)
---
is that a paladin tank that I see?
---
I can't deal with the look of dwarves, I'll be less helpful for fights like Onyxia but happier in general on my Night Elf priest.
---
&gt;Right click reporting is not really a big deal imo
---
Said no pvp player ever.
---
While not officially announced it is extremely unlikely.
---
Gold is a big part of the Vanilla end-game, an epic mount is a serious advantage and prestige item, the desire for which drives you out into the world to farm mobs, gives you reasons to do professions and run dungeons for BoE items and toys. 
---
It wouldn't just be inauthentic, it would undermine both personal and guild logistical goals in an expansion that isn't designed for it. 
---
&gt; Unless you really want to be in Molten Core in the first month with the elite,
---
'elite' players will start vanilla at later times too
---
not all the good players will be there from the start so there will be other openings later
---
No offense but stone talon and ashenvale are at least level 16 but more level 20 range. But yea silver pine and Barrens are larger but you have 4 races in those 2 zones. It will be just as cluttered as mulgore or durotar IMO. I guess we will find out though :) 
---
Classic won't be a "faithful recreation" of Vanilla. It will be Vanilla with permanent 1.12.1 balancing and different content release schedule.
---
I don't want it to but I'm not gonna lose sleep over it, war effort is cool but it's really sort of a minor thing for anybody outside, the top 10% of guilds
---
Maraudon another great dungeon.
---
I rerolled a dwarf priest for tbc and his name was reroll. You care right? 1 hour sleep day woohoo!
---
Yes!!  Bemils was our DPS warrior.  Mega tanked pretty much all our 5 mans (and was really good).  In Scholo pally tanks did especially well against the undead.  What hurt was not having shackle cc without a  priest.  And I couldn't use roots indoors.
---
I too, can't wait for the Hakkar event to bug out after spending 2 hours clearing the place :&lt;
---
Blizzard was able to retrieve a reference copy of 1.12.1 from their archives. It sounds like they have the information on what items came with 1.10 also. I would hope they have the information about item stats from previous patches, although that has not been confirmed. People have been able to retrieve old information from Thotbot, etc &amp; incorporate that into the N0stalr1us core. There's no guarantee that Thorbot is 100% accurate either, but it's the best information available without some sort of confirmation.
---
Totally disagree, i dont see how someones changing their hair color could affect my gameplay experience or why do you even care at all. Just can not grasp your problems.
---
it is, from last week
---
not even credited him. Asshole
---
I genuinely don't care at all about content release schedule.
---
IMO, world PvP and causing world PvP IS the true endgame.
---
Why even do raids or dungeons? To become stronger for wpvp raids. Why even grind up all that rank gear in BG's mindlessly for hours on end, to have an trophy to tell people how much a neckbeard you have grinding r13/14? No. Its so you can use that gear to smash people's face in world PvP and city raids.
---
Why bust your ass doing end game stuff like trying to kill c'thun or progress through naxx? For how fun pve raids are in vanilla? No. For the fact it rewards insanely powerful gear to go hunt down the opposite faction with.
---
All the gear rewarding content is (IMO) a means to an end. Its an ongoing arms race that you must work for to be rewarded with the true end game... Powerful gear to incite conflict. 
---
That is in my opinion the true end game, and also why I feel pve servers miss the point.
---
&gt; Making a cool video doesn't make playing any harder.
---
Maybe for you, I guess. Myself I find if I am using the mouse to point the camera at something that impacts my ability to use it to move or select targets from raid frames.
---
&gt; And this is not an isolated thing - pretty much every Vanilla PvE video you can find has people making really stupid and obvious mistakes throughout each fight.
---
I'm just saying that pirate server players treat vanilla videos the way moon landing deniers treat videos of moon landings. They aren't trying to understand what they see, they're trying to find things to make uninformed fun of so they can feel better about themselves.
---
I'm sure there are lots of mistakes, and I'm also sure that they are misinterpreting a lot of what they see. I mean, I was *not* in a world class guild, I was *not* a world class player, but in 2006 and 2007 I had everything keybound, knew what to cast and when, used the optimal rotation, got the optimal gear from what was available to me, maybe there was a subtlety or two I was missing somewhere but I am pretty sure I had all the low-hanging fruit and then some. So when people try to tell me that players who were much more experienced and dedicated than me were all keyboard-turning doofuses I just do not buy it. Some, maybe. All? I very much doubt it.
---
I mean, if they were all that bad, who was writing the guides and forum posts I was reading that taught me how to play? Pixies?
---
&gt; I've never actually seen a proper MC speedrun video from retail Vanilla. Do you have one where everyone is fully worldbuffed/using full consumables and the raid is stacking melee while using the bare minimum of healers?
---
Nope. In fact I have a bit of a suspicion that stacking melee is something done in pirate servers because it is exploiting something un-Blizzlike. Back in the day for things like cross-guild Rag speed kills you stacked mages.
---
&gt; First of all, Ragnaros has always been killable in blues and using little to no consumables - there's loads of video proof on youtube.
---
Yet the people in purples spent months trying and failing.
---
Not so sure about that. Most people I see nowadays only take 1-3 Druids into their raids. On the other Hand: If nobody wants to play resto druid and everyone is looking for a Healer, you will get into the raid regardless of the few spots.
---
This is of cause only based on the assumption that not every druid player wants to heal because some want to be a feral DD/Tank (Boomkin?). So least played classed (atleast on most PS) and not everyone wants to play the one spec most raids want.
---
 \[EU\] Lonely Vanilla Veteran Looking for Brothers in Arms 
---
And thus I return to the world that I so long ago fell in love with, and yet thought I should never see again. Ever since release, have my heart been beating for the long stretches of the Azeroth I called home. But alas, it is clear to me that for now this is a journey I am going to make alone. 
---
I therefore seek companions in arms, to embark on this grand adventure with me. 
---
I played extensively in vanilla, raiding up to AQ40, and it was the time of my life. To me, the social aspect was always the most incredible and as I intend to hit Classic hard, I'm looking for nice, polite and equally enthusiastic people to partake in this long haul. I want to reach max level, progress seriously through the raids and all the good stuff.   
---
I really want to have made some friends from the beginning of the game. Running dungeons with a set group, talking and having fun and learning together, is what I'm after. 
---
I'm EU and though I mained rogue and warlock back in the day, I've been considering trying out my style with Paladin. But I'm not locked to anything and would be willing to try out different things depending on what's needed  My schedule is pretty flexible. 
---
So, if you out there would like a leveling/dungeon/later raiding partner, please hit me up with message on reddit! 
---
Regards!
---
/yell TOO SOON! YOU HAVE AWAKENED ME TOO SOON, EXECUTUS! 
---
The gist of it is that a more staggered content release approach will create a better gameplay experience.  Some of the later raiding/dungeon content (like ZG and Diremaul) make earlier content (like Molten Core) obsolete (not to mention later item balance patches) and so not releasing everything together means that players will have to "progress" through this content as it was naturally experienced (with a higher difficulty).
---
The off-hand from "It's Dangerous to go Alone" is imba when the game first came out - lowers the mana cost of every cast by (25 or something) which was huge when the game first came out. It was later changed to be not so great.
---
Warrior is one of the slowest levelers. If you want to power level, Hunter is the fastest.
---
No, I'm talking about experiencing the actual world.  The land and the NPCs and yes, the opposing faction.  Flying took that away and it was a terrible design choice.
---
Exactly
---
This is why vanilla &gt; wotlk. Insta teleport queueing just ruined dungeons 
---
And frankly vanilla &gt; tbc where flying was introduced and the world condensed into a tiny few places that 70s farm
---
In true vanilla it’s a huge ass world everyone is roaming regardless of level, immersion is real and it’s not holding your hand 
---
Go wsg, carry flags.
---
8-10 days if you're skipping professions. If you aim for good gear etc then could be up to 20.
---
I found that the key to speedy leveling is spirit regen uptime. It sounds like you found a way to do that as elemental.
---
What is your method?
---
Mob A. Heal/Lightning bolt/melee? ------&gt; Mob B. Melee? ------&gt; Mob C. Heal/Lightning bolt/melee? ------&gt; and so on?
---
EB kiting is good compared to Stoneskin totem but Stoneskin lasts longer.
---
the novelty of 1.1 itemised loot fades after a few weeks of progression where almost every piece of gear that drops is a waste of time. I think that warlocks are the most extreme case where they get 1 upgrade from onyixa's lair before the 1.4 MC loot revamp.
---
As someone who recently has been toying around on a *cough* server, I ran WC and it was SOOOOOOO much longer than I remember. Did they change the layout in retail or is it just my 5th grade brain storing memories wrong?? 
---
As someone who hasn't touched WoW in 11 years... Can I get a TL:dr?
---
I hit level 60 the week before Burning Crusades came out. So I've always felt like I missed out on a lot of Vanilla WoW. I spent years (was still in high school had 1 character of each class, never really focused on leveling just one) trying to get to level 60 so I could go on massive 30+ person raids.
---
But when I hit level 60, everyone was hyped for getting into BC, and didn't want to go on large raids. Also they made the max raid size to like 5 or something. So it was sort of a gunshot spending all that time looking to get to the "end game" but once I got there the thing I was working so hard for....wasn't there.
---
I hope they do this not only to coordinate with friends but also to avoid streamers
---
Pepega
---
Figuring out that dungeon with my guild was responsible for a couple painfully long, rage inducing runs.  Despite being a well done dungeon, the association with those long assed aggravating runs has made me dislike and generally skip it even after the cata nerf.    
---
Why not go human then? They're the best looking alliance race by a mile and better than dwarves in most situations (although by a tinier margin)
---
Cross-realm BG's were added in 1.12, not the 2.0 TBC pre-patch. So officially they fall within the scope of vanilla, just like server transfers do.
---
25 years old, no job? no girlfriend? no school? no ambition in life?
---
Same boat. Still playing the same character i rolled over a year ago just to try out.. first weeks i played a bit, then made friends.. some of the people i leveled with are still in my friends list. 
---
So much better, got so happy when they announced it. 
---
Whats really gonna blow my mind besides this is when they announce the scrapping of loot trading and how extremely limited sharding will be on launch, (only being on starting zones and for a very **Very** limited time) and never applied again.
---
I don't worry at all about missing out on quests, just outleveling them at some point, for whatever reason. And I don't worry about that either, it's just a thing that happens / can happen.  
---
All I wanted to say is that scaling zones can be an advantage IMO.
---
Somewhere between 10 and 20 days of playtime depending on how focused on leveling you'll be.
---
Ahhh.... The dream!
---
First you state the complaint:
---
*"The player base became increasingly spread out as the zones were disjointed and not part of the same world"*
---
And then your solution is:
---
*"The solution for this. Is to keep each and every future zone in the same one world. To achieve that, the water areas need to be traversible"*
---
So adding huge zones of water is the solution for a spread out player base?  
---
And you dont think this sounds completely stupid?
---
I’m thinking “ideal” setups aren’t going to be as prevalent as min-maxers make them out to be.  Recently I started an orc warrior to test drive Vanilla, and I cannot get in to it.  I’m getting to the  point I would rather play a prot Paladin, even if it throws a wrench in to my raiding plans.
---
I’m not going to be surprised if a lot of alleged not-ideal combos end up being played just because people want to be comfy over shooting for the magic utility spec that will get them in to raids.
---
the thing is if you are farming regularly you'll be able to afford respecs anyway. 
---
if you truly just hate respeccing you could probably get away with playing a mage and using this spec https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/A-Q8AwAFPziGPE0
---
you sacrifice arcane meditation and 1 point in piercing ice to get 2/3 imp blizz and 2/3 permafrost. this will allow you to aoe farm, pvp and raid all in one spec.
---
I am ok with all except name change. So People cant hide when char sold or ninja
---
It'll still be used by a fair number of people I'd wager, but Discord will probably be a little more popular as the go-to.
---
Also, for what it's worth the [b.net](https://b.net) chat client isn't half bad.  The fact you can practically create/manage a clan in the bnet app alone is kinda awesome.
---
Yeah it's dumb as fuck. I'm only interested in playing warlock again, mugs can eat and then shit out a brick if they think it's even remotely sensible to have warlocks be broken nonfunctional turds for 6-8 months before we're allowed talents that actually work and have some kind of effect.
---
I'm sure there are other classes who feel the same about certain points in their timeline. We already know 2-3 classes are super OP for most of vanilla, why ingrain it 10 times worse.
---
For whatever reason I never did the pre-60 dungeons very much, so I remember little of them. But for even the ones I did run 10 million times (scholomance, BRD, UBRS, etc.) I don't remember the pattern for the pulls, or most of the boss mechanics.
---
Hell, I've forgotten how to do MC and BWL.
---
*Streamlining intensifies*
---
Nothing announced, but probably. Given they've taken the effort to run it on their modern infrastructure there's very little to lose for them to put up at least a few OCE realms. 
---
Think this has not so much to do with actual gear than it will have with how pservers work. Im 90% sure armor in private servers is off from how it was in classic, hence melees being so much better in damage compared to classic.
---
Realm transfers would let people do all of that as well.
---
(It Ain’t Me) starts playing.
---
Why would you stack agil? Isn't strength much better?
---
Hi, /u/nassilovesyou
---
18 hours a day. How is that even possible? 
---
ITT people pretend they had fun in sunken temple
---
July 17th
---
They're not "bringing back" anything. They're not patching stuff back into retail. It's not a remaster with tweaks.
---
I don't understand what you you're on about. They are literally recreating vanilla like it was in 2006 at patch 1.12.
---
I honestly don't understand your thought process when you say it should "stay back in the past". Then why the hell are you even going to play Classic? You clearly don't want Classic, you want vanilla with QOL changes.
---
That's not what you're getting. They've already said that. We are getting a time machine to 1.12, end of story.
---
Not too bad tbh. When I did it back in the day I had the area mostly to myself. The mobs are easily located and population dense, and you can save all the drops for instant revered and exalted.
---
I wouldn't define people starting late as elite, we're not talking about "good" players here, we're talking about the top ones. 
---
But your point stands I guess, you will be able to get a tank spot if you don't push for 60 within two weeks. 
---
Who’s the second best? Warriors are the best and then I thought it was druids?
---
Shaman gets curse of tongues slapped on him and the warlock will go make a coffee and come back to see the shaman finish his first cast.
---
So lets pretend you were buying a car and you had zero knowledge about cars and you had to friends one that knows a shitload could tell you how many nuts,bolts,screws or even how many fibres are in each car seat or someone who has driven a car to work for 2 years that mum bought him for his 18th birthday? You're going to want the person who knows his shit helping you pick out the perfect car out of the ones you want.
---
It's the same principle here, Let's use his " Why BRD is the BEEEEST Dungeon ever" video someone above us posted, He got to level 38, That is 12 levels too low even if he was getting carried through a full run of BRD. Now lets assume he did it in BC while leveling, He did it with Better gear ( he would of had ST quest item,More spellpower/Attackpower on gear ) or possibly a level 70 carrying him through or even a tank with a couple of Quest items from Hellfire he still did not get to experience the dungeon how it was, nor did he do it on a Private server at the time of the video.
---
So we have -
---
10 minute long videos for the sake of making $ from ads - Check
---
Talking about something he has no clue about - Check
---
Saying something is good when he has never experienced it - Check
---
If you love his videos good for you,More power to you. But out of all of the "classic" content creators there are better ones out there to support than Tips his videos are Almost as bad as losing to a level 17 hunter as a 25 Druid bad.
---
Almost.
---
Meh, and play properly? Ain’t nobody got time for that!
---
There's some more things to consider. Right now they specified 1.10 because it is the largest jump in relative power level across the board, but they haven't said anything about other items that were introduced in other patches that logically also spike power levels (not talking about progressive itemization).  
---
For example, the blue post mentioned that right now they're thinking of having phase 2 being content from patch 1.3 and 1.4. Patch 1.4.0 introduced updated loot tables to raid content - notably items such as Mana Igniting Chord, Ring of Spell Power, Quick Strike Ring, Onslaught Girdle, all of the loot in Domo's chest. Does this mean that MC bosses in phase 1 will not drop the 1.4.0 items? If the answer is no and that MC should include all of its gear from phase 1 then that gives Classic players the ability to farm this very powerful gear for a longer time than was possible in retail vanilla, which wouldn't be in line with the "power gains" argument? Will Onyxia drop her head in phase 1, giving powerful upgrades and Rallying Cry world buff, when it wasn't on her loot table pre 1.4.0?  
---
Other less extreme examples might be stuff like ST class trinkets, which didn't get introduced until later in the game, e.g. warrior quest got introduced in 1.7 IIRC. One of the rewards from that quest is Diamond Flask, which is relatively speaking one of the most powerful trinkets in the game (75 str self buff which lasts for 1 min, scales with blessing of kings). Surely that falls into the category of being too big of a power gain. Same applies for hunters with their Devilsaur Eye.  
---
Hopefully there will be more information out when it's closer to the release date.  
---
I know we're not ones to judge on this sub, but 18+ hours a day playing a video game is straight up bad for your health. Weird to require this but then specify "maturity and positive mental attitude, no toxicity". You didn't even need 18+ h/day for Rank 14 and that was already unhealthy. 
---
Personally I'm gonna wait until there's a beta before I start theorycrafting macros, we might end up with a bastardization between Vanilla and Legion macro capabilities. 
---
There were some crazy macros in Vanilla, for example Swifty came up with one that allowed him to use Charge in combat (until it was patched)
---
/script local i; CastShapeshiftForm(1); CastSpellByName("BloodRage"); CastSpellByName("Charge"); for i = 0,15 do if ( GetPlayerBuffTexture(i) == "Interface\\Icons\\Ability_Racial_BloodRage") then CancelPlayerBuff(i); end;
---
If you had programming experience, in Vanilla you had a field day creating crazy macros that looped and did all sorts stuff. The reason they moved away from that system was precisely because it was easy to exploit.
---
Hi everyone, really unsure if this type of guild would even exist but I’m looking for a guild that would raid server time on weekends early morning i.e 7-10am. This is when I have most of my spare time free from irl / work commitments.
---
Prefer horde but for obvious reasons I’m flexible. Previous vanilla experience was primarily ZG (levelled late) before clearing all of tbc up to sunwell before going off to uni. 
---
Previous experience was main tank but looking for a dps role this time round.
---
Thanks in advance! 
---
The scaling of strength is poor, especially at lower levels.  While it doesn't make sense at first because you'd think at lower levels, even the slightest amount of strength would make more of an impact, right?  (not right)
---
Let's say you're fighting a quillboar in southern barrens.
---
It takes you 6 hits to kill it.  It would take nearly unobtainable amounts of strength (especially at that level) to change the killtime on that boar from 6 hits to 5 hits.  The scaling of the strength increase to your melee attack power is just not great due to the limited amount of stats available.
---
Agility however gives you crit chance.  A critical strike CAN SOMETIMES reduce the number of hits on a mob from 6 down to 5 or even 4.  Because of this, agility is generally regarded as superior, especially early on, since crits are far more efficacious at proving useful.  
---
Because enhancement shaman benefit doubly from crits (Flurry Talent) and this gives them attack speed, Agility is regarded as the superior stat.  Strength is something you should still strive for.  Especially later on as a targeted stat, but you shouldn't give up too much agility, if any, in place of it.
---
Not third best tank.  Best third tank. Main tank and primary off tank are warriors. Then a druid 3rd, then fury wars tank as needed. The raid kills the druid target first as you have the best threat,  then you pull from the fury wars and they switch back to dps, once it is just you and the primary ot you swap weapons as needed and go cat/heal/ decurse as needed the rest of the way. 
---
I need to vendor everything for cash, especially on a fresh server.  I guess "everyone need everything" is the only logical conclusion here, then?
---
Oh wait, no, I'm still drawing the line at items that specific classes can equip and get upgrades from.
---
Here are a couples of the ones i've been using over the years.
---
/run a="Arcane Intellect" b={1,4,18,32,47} c="target" d="(Rank "  e=CastSpellByName if (UnitLevel(c) \~= nil and UnitIsFriend("player",c))  then for i=5,1,-1 do if (UnitLevel(c) &gt;= b*)* then e(a..d..i..")") return end end else e(a,1) end
---
This will cast the max rank of Arcane Intellect available to the targets level. Useful for when you're running by low levels and want to buff them without having to open your spellbook looking for the correct rank. 
---
/run TargetByName("REPLACE THIS TO NPC NAME", true) CastSpellByName("Fire Blast")
---
Helpful for when you want that mob tag whilst leveling - obviously just make sure you input the correct name of the NPC into the macro.
---
/run SpellStopCasting() CastSpellByName("Counterspell") 
---
Spellstop macros are useful for clutch situations where you need a quick IB/Cold Snap/Blink or Counterspell. Again, just make sure to create a macro for each spell. 
---
Shift+Key = rank 1 Arcane Explosion
---
Key = highest rank
---
/run CastSpellByName(IsShiftKeyDown() and "Arcane Explosion(rank 1)" or "Arcane Explosion")
---
Replace spell name here with other useful spells you want to downroak. Ie. Frostbolt, Fireball, Fire Blast, Blizzard, Cone of Cold. If you're into PvP i suggest to do the same with buffs (AI, Dampen Magic, Mana Shield) for dispell protection. 
---
From a rogue isn't wasn't hard at all.  I always had 200+ gold and didn't farm very often at all. 
---
This is so true for me as well. My goal is to finally participate in those battles rather than just watching them which was the case for me at the time.
---
Vividly remember running in to a large group of allies outside the entrance to BB as I was leveling looking all menacing, so I couldn't enter and hand in my quest or whatever I was doing. They were chilling and duelling there for a while, so I asked in /1 for help. Eventually I had a squad of decked out locks (3 of them from the same guild) coming down to me, and when they showed up they dropped infernals on the allies and went ham.
---
Massive nerd boner as I stood there watching, will never forget
---
I mean, you say that but there's an interview on a french website from blizzcon where WoW Classics executive producer, John Hight, talks about how excited he is for voice chat. So that he doesn't have to muck around with private passwords to 3rd party voips.  
---
Also a calendar is already implemented on their client because they found it very useful.
---
Guild banks suddenly seem a lot more likely, no?
---

---
&gt;All of the weapon buffs are basically the same in damage overall, and should only be altered based on the individal mob's resistances.
---
I've watched that video extensively and as someone who played shaman you're only partially correct.  If you have enough spellpower gear, flametongue weapon or frostbrand weapon become better for you than the others (enemy resistances aside).  
---
The main draw of the weapon buffs is actually adaptability and what rank is available of the spell.  As you're leveling you should generally use the "newest" rank of any of the weapon buffs you just learned as it will increase your dps more.
---
At 60, you're choice of weapon buffs will be dictated by talent choices, playstyle preference, gear, and what activity you're doing.  Frostbrand/Windfury are the preferred choice in PvP situations for example. Rockbiter/Flametongue is generally used more often in PvE situations.  Obviously there are going to be niche situations for both that don't take into account other factors.
---
THE VENT PTT SOUND
---
You don't need an epic mount you want one to make travelling faster. You can walk fine without one. 
---
The Dwarf females are cute, with that one specific face, from kinda far away, in the darkness of Ashenvale, when my monitor is turned off... maybe just roll Horde
---
But female dwarves' pigtails spin around like a helicopter when they cast spells and they have giant bouncing breasts when they run. #priorities
---
If I do roll warlock, I'll be buying an epic UD horse.  There is no way I'm waiting for DM to get my epic mount.  
---
Does anyone have a list of the items added to old dungeons in 1.10? It'll obvious change how we weight the value of running those dungeons pre- and post- phase 5 but I can't find any resource online that separates the loot tables in that way.
---
This fella is a troll, he's posted this a few times, don't take the bait.
---
I pronounce it "fur- bolg" hope that helps lol
---
Actually there's not. 
---
The profit you'd get from needed on everything and vendoring would probably be able the same as getting one boe epic. 
---
Agreed. Implementation is incredibly important (in that it can't be a thing past early zones or else the whole community part is dead) but early zones are a cluster fuck and no one is meeting life long friends in the starter zones in the first week so having skated around trying to loot a mob for 10 minutes in 2004 I have no complaints about sharding through the first zone or two.
---
Fair enough but I would classify those two things as more backend additions tied to the new client. IMO guild bank is more of a gameplay change. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. 
---
The dungeon is designed to have that huge swath of levels to make it more alive and mysterious feeling. 
---
since this was added with 4.something and the client+server are based arround 7.3.5 there is a good to fair chance that this will in.
---
I truely hope so. 
---
Eh, never found it to be an issue on live and I've only really stopped pvp with legion as I got back to raiding mostly
---
&gt;Maybe for you, I guess. Myself I find if I am using the mouse to point the camera at something that impacts my ability to use it to move or select targets from raid frames.
---
So the argument is that the unsurpassable skill ceiling of Vanilla WoW is a dude who can't maintain his basic rotation and film at the same time during world first kill of the game's final boss?
---
&gt;I'm just saying that pirate server players treat vanilla videos the way moon landing deniers treat videos of moon landings. They aren't trying to understand what they see, they're trying to find things to make uninformed fun of so they can feel better about themselves.
---
So the skill ceiling in Vanilla is knee-deep, but at the same time there are some complicated reasons for completely deviating from your rotation as a fury warrior that nobody can figure out by looking at a video?
---
&gt;Nope. In fact I have a bit of a suspicion that stacking melee is something done in pirate servers because it is exploiting something un-Blizzlike. Back in the day for things like cross-guild Rag speed kills you stacked mages.
---
If you look at original MC videos, you will see melees topping the meters despite not using the correct rotation. 
---
&gt;Yet the people in purples spent months trying and failing.
---
Ragnaros was first killed by people in a mix of blues and purples (mostly blues, and the purples that were used were often crap) that often used memespecs, didn't use the right rotations, didn't have the correct group composition (no shaman in melee group, lol) and used pretty much no consumables. They were failing because they were playing wrong.
---
Hahaha yeah I saw it earlier and thought "Great tips, only 13 more to go" haha
---
It's difficult to tldr this in a meaningful way but; 
---
Content is being staggered in a much more considerate way than previously stated, slowing the pace that end game raid content will be demolished by big guilds. 
---
End game progression will have a steadier and hopefully more rewarding pace.
---
Gotta love those micro-raids
---
Ahh, sorry for the misunderstanding!
---
b-ah-lg or b-oh-lg?
---
A handwritten letter in cursive would have more prestige and panache. Add esquire or something fancy after your name, too! 
---
Elwynn Forest has a special place in our hearts
---
I'm with you on this one
---
That was also the case in vanilla, but I imagine it was difficult to prove/enforce.
---
They seem to have removed a bunch of filler pathways and sections that lead to only 1 boss (like the penned up stegosaurus) same with RFK were they removed that section at the end where you escort a goblin out of the dungeon 
---
Uh, no.  They are actually pretty significant in some aspects.  
---
In your example:  "Increases Lightning Bolt damage by 33." I do recall that being one of the relics for shaman.  In order for a spell to gain 33 damage, the spell co-efficient for LB was 85.7%.  That's effectively a piece of gear that says "+39 spellpower"
---
Considering that the ENTIRE Ten Storms set (tier 2 for shaman) only gave a total increase of 113 spellpower, for a single relic slot to effectively give you +39 spellpower is insane.  
---
User name almost definitely doesn't check out. 
---
That's not how statistics work. 
---
I want you to suck they're dick if thats true.
---
Nice try. I know starshards is really the OP option here.
---
I will make a counterpoint here. As a Druid player, hitting level 40 and getting access to Dire Bear form, which essentially means going from mail to plate as far as damage reduction is concerned makes quite a huge difference for survivability.
---
It's usually well worth trying to pick up some cheap plate pieces around 40 if you plan on doing any tanking.
---
They cut a bunch from WC as well in Retail, I cant remember which bits and pieces but it lost a whole lot of content
---
That would make you an asshole, and if I were grouped with you would blacklist you from grouping with me or anyone in my guild if I could.
---
Seriously, is this bizarro world? Or is this just the mentality generated by current retail wow players?  *"I don't have to worry about consequences, so fuck morality; fuck your generosity, and fuck this feeling of Vanilla Servers will make you care about your character! I want my GOLD!!!!"*
---
The fun thing about Hillbrad is that its a 20-30 Zone for Horde but a 35+ Zone for Alliance. 
---
yeah no halfassed spec will be any good in pvp without shatter :(
---
I'm glad that cute Gnome survived.
---
I personally saw scaling as something Blizzard did to "fix" something that only became a problem later on in the expansions. In vanilla you're encouraged to do all quests and explore all the zones. Quest-lines often lead you to do other zones. You'll find yourself grinding or doing dungeons just so you can move on to higher level zones (level 47-50 comes to mind).
---
I just don't consider out-leveling a zone to be a problem in vanilla unless you actively try to avoid questing somehow.
---
just trying to find the right person
---
Might there be a website or add on that tells me all the tricks and tips about dungeons in classic? 
---
you dont need it as much but it is still the best profession to have.  
---
sappers are king
---
Thing is, with WoW, it can be really hard to tell. Those rank14ers... 
---
And then they actually did this.  Holy crap.
---
Technically, "Updated Molten Core Loot" and "Silithus Content" are moved from where they are here, but still, wow.
---
Back then recording a Video was like building a fucking Rocket. 
---
1.) Overall they are much different. Different vibe and pace in my opinion.  Professions seemed much more valuable in Vanilla. For armor/weapon crafting professions such as LW and BS I feel like there were many valuable craftable pieces, even greens, that were useful at various levels.  
---
2.) The leveling challenge was mostly due to slower xp rates, more difficult mobs, and slower recovery. This made things like first aid that much more valuable as a warrior or a rogue. Casters had to drink frequently too. The entire pace was much slower and calculated. Group play was encouraged and necessary for some quests.
---
What, was this ever the case?
---
let em get one hoe
---
&gt; It changes the gold per hour quite a bit to end up being less efficient than other farming methods
---
Dont think you can find as profitable, NON CONTESTED grind anywhere else. Even if you have to corpse run 5 times per hour. Tbh, you might have to run much more than that if the faction balance isnt in your favour. On certain private server china still grinds that even if they get killed on coming out of the instance constantly. And the grind has been nerfed.
---
Regarding PvP: implement the basic honor system and unupgraded pvp sets in phase 2. implement blue upgraded set in phase 4. implement epic upgraded set in phase 5. Upgraded and new r14 weapons in phase 5 also?
---
Cheers 
---
Yeah, if they do the same kind of timeframes its going to be VERY long wait. Certainly not worth the gold.
---
I'd just wish we have bgs since phase 1. I levelled with bgs and I would always visit bg while levelling, especially on lvl X9, it was a part of my vanilla experience.
---
Yeah, the level range makes BRD stand out but its also a problem for lower level groups. Ironfoe + hoj will keep everyone going back for sure tho.
---
Yea, I think herb/engineering would make a lot of sense, but it would certainly have heavy upfront costs without any ore. Eng also provides no benefit to the guild.
---
Another fair question to ask is on the worth of leveling Tailoring just for bags and the chest piece at 60. It’ll take a month or so to get that much mooncloth, but I guess I could keep it longer just to sell bags and fund engineering. Lots of options.
---
northshire valley 😎
---
Fuck man fuck man no no oh no
---
Why would you make me remember this I blocked it out for a reason.  I'm having nam flashbacks about being lost and separated in there trying to talk other people how to come down
---
I thought I wanted this again but that one picture makes me worry and it's not even the worst place!
---
In all seriousness though, I haven't been there in so long I didn't even realize they changed it.  That's blown my mind and I'm terrified and a bit excited to go there again
---
&gt;Bunch of bullshit justifying acting like an asshole in-game.
---
Uh no, what you described is known as the **prisoner's dilemma**. Except your buying into the fear that ninja/greedy people will steal it from you.  So instead everyone acts like greedy assholes and "needs" the item, causing the entire community to lose. 
---
The "winning scenario" in the prisoner's dilemma in reference to WoW BoE loot would be that you only roll need on things you need.  If this is approached by everyone the same,  it's a better situation overall than everyone rolling need on every single blue/purple that drops.  It may not "make you gold", but overall it's a healthier, more balanced approach that doesn't create a caustic and toxic community environment.
---
This sub really is mostly
---
Min maxers huh? lol ill definitely be going Ne or Human priest for looks
---
late reply, but warlocks in raids didnt really use many debuff slots for their own purposes. They provided curse of elements for mages and curse of shadows for themselves, and then spammed shadowbolt.
---
Oh, b-oh-lg for me.
---
bro your post assumes it will take more than a week for players to do everything 8.1.5 has to offer
---
And that is perfectly fine. As you said, it’s the *only* gear that is gated behind consecutive time.
---
You can go for other gear.
---
Nice, which tools did you use? :)
---
Lol, it says northshire Abby on the map.
---
Their plan was, at least, that BOP loot is shareable to the group members for 2 hours after they drop to cut down GM time spent on giving loot to their rightful owners.
---
Hopefully, they revisit this. 
---
If it must change from classic where GM's would have to do all the loot exchange manually. Make it so that loot trading is not allowed at all. (aka you misloot your screwed) or only items that drop in raids **and** are masterlooted are tradable for two hours. (This is where majority of the loot issues happen) 
---
All loot being tradable would just mean that people roll need for their friends in dungeons.
---
#MARKED
---
The "useless" narrative is something that I hope dies with more casual guilds. They certainly can't output the kind of DPS you'd get from Fury, but it's not like the encounters in Vanilla require full min-max to complete :\
---
If youre new to vanilla, id suggest not rushing to max . Youll be in for some disappointment if youre looking for fun raid content.  The exploration especially leads to some of the best memories in vanilla. 
---
Why would a PvE healer need sappers? Other than for doing DMN runs or w/e. But strictly for raiding, they're not needed.
---
Bruh he obviously knows that shit. He's just playing the role of an interviewer and letting all of the information come from the interviewee MonkeyNews. 
---
&gt;Classic isn't something you want to rush with. 
---
Fuck that. Each for its own. Theres people that have done 20-30 max level chars in vanilla. You most likely do alts in classic (if you are going to play it for 1-2 years).
---
Your confusion is likely because a lot of hunters would get mail from there for when they hit 40.
---
you could do away with imp counterspell or something else for shatter if need be. The thing is if you want to do every piece of content with only one spec you'll be gimping yourself one way or another, that goes for every class in the game.
---
&gt;Loot Trading and such however would have a huge negative impact on the community by incentivising ninja looting.
---
I disagree.  The only thing loot trading does is save the person who was supposed to get the loot 4 days of waiting to get the loot.  All loot trading does is negate the process of putting in a ticket...waiting for GM to read ticket and investigate...transfer item to correct person.  Blizz already stated that loot trading doesn't effect the game in any way other than save everyone wait time for the item to get to the right person.  They're not removing it.
---
If someone ninja loots there isn't anything you can do about that with or without loot trading so that excuse is negated.  Use master loot to avoid ninja looting...I don't see how you are letting people ninja loot.  
---
.
---
Getting silenced is a death sentence in classic. You need to talk to other people to do anything, dungeons, elites, crafting etc.
---
Okay, taking everything into consideration.
---
1. In one blue post, they said "Get ready for A classic summer". Which could mean an early/mid summer release, because you can't have "a classic summer" if it releases in the end of summer.
---
2. In the most recent big blue post, the CM basically said that phase(stage) 1 is already set and done. What is still up for debate is when they are going to release phase(stage) 2-6 and that they might wait with phase 2 "FOR A WHILE" to let players get fully ready for that phase. This alone means that they could already have phase 1 ready or close to ready for launch.
---
3. Common sense wise, it would be perfect to release classic WoW early or mid summer since most people are off from work and school. I know a few internet friends that can play simply because they bet the release will be in July, it releasing in the end of summer would be counter-productive if you think about pure numbers.
---
So if you ask me, it won't be end of summer. They will most likely release classic in June/July and have it on phase 1 for like 5+ months. I've been spamming the question about the release date after the most recent blue post since they said they will read and answer our question as much as they can now, I have friends that needs to know the release date aswell so they can take time off work to play. 
---
So my advice is to help spam ask about the release date.
---
Will everyone have the same order in the serverlist? So if the first server on my list is "Illidan" for example, will everyone in my region have "Illidan" pop up as the first server on the list too? 
---
Hi, /u/g13turtle
---
If you find someone with 1000g+ on a fresh server less than 3 months old, congratulations you found either A) An asian gold farmer or B) the person who bought from the asian gold farmer.
---
This logic, even if I agreed with it; is being justified with such bullshit it's almost asinine.  99% of people on a server less than 3 months old will not have "thousands" of gold to buy edgemasters.  So either you're going to "sit" on that edgemasters for months until the economy has developed  enough to support 1000g+ edgemasters on the auction house: or you do two alteratives:
---
* **You sell it for a market variable price: which means you're not making as much gold as you thought/think you were going to.**
---
* **You allow the warrior to equip his BiS gloves because you aren't an asshole who thinks only in gold.**
---
1-3 is not a lot in the raid. Optimally, you want 2 healing druid and optionally a feral druid. They make great off-tanks.
---
Moonkin I wish was useful but you actually hurt your raids DPS doing this. I say this as a RK13 druid that I wish druids were more needed.
---
Agree, either shard the starts, or include que system. I find the shards are a lesser evil than waiting for 2+ hours in que to just get into an zone.
---
This is also account sharing and will get the account banned, or even all the accounts involved, so they should definitely consider official guild banks.
---
getting hit gear isn't so bad early. You wont hit cap, but getting like 5% isnt difficult. 
---
Locks are competing with frost mages at this point in the game (not fire). Shadowbolt does more damage baseline. I think early on frost gets better modifiers though.
---
Warlocks are not S tier early on, but i dont think its fair to say that they suck.
---
&gt;There's a massive difference between needing on 1 item that changes your game experience and needing a hundred times on small items.
---
You mean like a warrior in a group with Edgemasters dropping and losing it to some greedy asshole such as yourself?  You're right, that does change your gaming experience.  I'd probably blacklist you if i were a warrior in that situation.  Oh, staff of jordan dropped?  Hope you don't mind the warrior needing on that even though it would be a decent upgrade for quite a few levels for you.  
---
Did everyone turn into hunters in the last 15 years?  The idea of hunters needing on everything was a joke/meme but it seriously feels like the last 15 years have caused people to lose all semblance of logic and fair though.  So much for the "classic community" eh?
---
Oh, all you "greedy" assholes better hope it doesn't drop while your mid-dungeon.  You can expect a short-kick or a complete dissolution of your group in situations like that.
---
Loot trading saves GMs time of having to investigate and transfer items around, and it saves the player 4 days of waiting for their item.  Loot trading simplifies the process and negates the waiting period.  It has no other effect on the game at all.  Blizz already said they're leaving it, so people need to get over it.
---
I actually disabled this feature using the parental system because the voice chat system increases the loading time by twofold, so I obviously never used it, not even since the first introduction of it in like patch 2.2.0. My solution would be to just copy/paste a discord invite link in the chat if you have to communicate with someone.
---
I don't think a single soul cares about voip in WoW
---
Id say some of the "elite" players are still players that dont have time to play 15h/day. Getting 60 in 2 weeks is beyond hardcore in classic, week 2 mc is going to be world first territory. Im aiming about 1 month to 60 and depending on what class i end up playing, dont think its too bad. 
---
Levelup can seriously burn you out, after getting bit of prebis, you can take it much, much more casually (while still raiding on the top level). 
---
Its gonna be hard, but some pieces (mail ones and tier) wont have competition, also you can aim to get rank10 gear...
---
I made the zone with Inkarnate, a Pro subscription is about 10 USD a month. but Reddit doesn't destroy image sizes, and I make no claim to sell them for money, you're more than welcome to just download this one and keep it, I plan to do most zones and I export them in HQ -High res format for free.
---
I personally don't believe in profiteering off a game that I didn't design, create, or work on so consider anything I release free to use for the general public :)
---
My first and only time clearing ST back in the day resulted in the ‘dragon’s call’ dropping.  I rolled against the other paly in the group and lost...  
---
I saw him again months later leveling in winterspring, still using the sword with 3 dragons helping him.
---
Talents i agree 100%.
---
Items, i like the progressive itemisation. It gives you longer to mow down the content, and more to do. It also allows for slower levelers and alts and so on to catch up.
---
Im gonna play a priest, once DM hits, most of the MC gear is trash apart from new 1.4 stuff.
---
i know warlocks are the best 1v1 class, but the topic was about pvp in general and not just dueling.
---
I agree 100%. I'm incredibly invested in the whole "it's a world and people need to be together in the world" aspect that people want. That was honestly why I played and why I went from a casual player interested in PvP trying to get Rammstein's lightning bolts to a raider working a full time job playing this game after class. But I also remember the long ass queues just to play and the unbearable lag when the game started. I'll take a few weeks of a sketchy community to avoid that as long as the community stuff comes in as soon as it can.
---
I'm not saying they should change anything, but in retrospect, that was a silly idea. There are way more effective ways of making a dungeon feel alive/useless than to have most of it be useless for groups when you go in there. 
---
Classic had an emphasis on 'perfect balance doesn't make a perfect game'. Not every spec was viable in every situation, some are good in PvP, some are better in PvE. Every class had their own niche thing, Rogues were known for stunning, Mages known for their CC and AoE, Warlocks for their summoning/soulstones, Warriors were the best for tanking, etc. This gave you some feeling of individuality, which I feel like is lost on retail WoW where every class is capable of doing pretty much everything.
---
Professions were definitely more meaningful, especially because important recipes were rare and sometimes only a few people on those servers would be trusted to have people hand over their materials to them to craft something for them. Engineering was also hugely important in PvP if you wanted to push it to the letter, and first aid was a must for pretty much every class, including healers.
---
I assume it'll be in there as part of the interface, but I can't say anyone cares about it.
---
You poor, poor, naive soul.
---
I agree. I remember playing through BRD in Vanilla and doing *all* of the dungeon. I recall it took an ungodly number of hours and I was falling asleep by the time I made it to the throne.
---
I wish whoever had the idea to break up SM into multiple wings had a bigger voice in designing BRD, ST, and a few others. The length does contribute to the feeling of epicness, but it's going to be tough to do that again 15 years later.
---
ST was the first instance where I really thought "wow!". Because ST has dragons! Proper fucking dragons. I don't know about anyone else, but I love me some dragons
---
&gt; 1.12 talents will already make MC a joke 
---
For less than 1% of the player base. Easy for the next 5%. Acceptable easy for the next 10%. Medium for the next 20%. Hard for like 30%. Fucking hard for the rest.
---
Which will ALWAYS be the case for BWL, AQ40 and Naxx.
---
AS IT WAS INTENDED.
---
Also, you and 70% of the player base will wipe in MC when BWL will be open.
---
Yes.
---
&gt; Early in the game, the set items dropped in Molten Core alongside Tier 1, but were removed in Patch 1.4. Tier 2 was readded in Patch 1.6with the addition of Blackwing Lair.

---
If I want Classic but not retail, is that an option? Is there an option to not pay the full $15 per month?
---
I've never ever used the integrated voice chat in WoW. If you join a guild, doing raids via 3rd party software such as Discord is far better. 
---
Dungeons don't need voice (or atleast running dungeons on normal). 
---
Can a super geared hunter beat them with cheetah kiting and viper sting? Wyvern the pet
---
Not a fan of this dungeon. Half of it was just repetitive and braindead and just a huge waste of time.
---
It would be nice if after two or three years they added content like grim batol, hyjal, stuff like that, but kept the level cap at 60 and made the loot from the new places naxx level but with different stats, like make a set for paladins that isnt a healing set, or a set for warriors that isnt a tanking set for example. Sidegrades for less common specs.
---
Blizz already said it's going to be in classic, so I'm glad you won't be playing because of it.
---
That's the point though - they didn't take up debuff slots from more 'important' classes that used them 
---
"Everyone"
---
I'd think Shaman is your answer. The most high demand horde-side healer (some raids might take as many as eight) and they're great at PvP.
---
They said they don't have a reliable source of data to recreate patch progression. I think that already implied that full itemization is very unlikely.
---
Funny you rag on private servers when this latest announcements is nothing more than blizzard copying what private servers have done the last couple years and everyone is acting like blizzard is some genius for it. 
---
&gt;If we both loose such a rare and amazing peice of gear for the one who put in the work to see it drop, that sucks balls, and I move on probably blocking the needers after the run.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;From my own experience in Vanilla, the people who rolled need for gold were fine until it was their BiS, then they hated it.
---
Yea, it's always people who go "need on all boes" until a BiS/good upgrade appears for them, then their tune changes.  Hypocrisy at it's finest.  It's essentially the age old *"Rock is fine, nerf Scissors" - Paper routine*
---
Noone cares until they are the rock.  I guess it takes being shit on for people to understand that life isn't about being greedy or fucking over other people in equivalent situations.
---
Also, I'd do the same Vejret.  I'd block/blacklist the people who act that way.  I don't need greedy people needing on every little thing ruining my game experience.
---
There should be a strawpoll like this for every type of server. 
---
imagine being this jaded over free content that isn't harming anyone.
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
I am so looking forward to scholo
---
Most raids won't take more than one feral druid, two tops if one of them is an offtank maybe. And resto druids are the least in-demand healers.
---
Honestly, the whole video is worth a watch. It's full of great information.
---
While im apathetic towards loot trading, I think you're ignoring the important aspect of, people rolling need for their friends. 
---
Granted, you could argue that this is Classic and you should be socializing and putting together your own groups with friends, thats still an important distinction. 
---
*micro-waves*
---
Prefer the look and lore of the night elves for my priest.  
---
Sorry to break it to you, but your dickishness shows that you aren't the kind of person that should be playing an MMO.
---
So good job proving my point, I guess.
---
Given vast open spaces hunter can be everything. Problem is perfect conditions do not really exists and its real easy to fuck up hunters right at the start by just running at them mounted.
---

&gt;Back in 2004 we haven't had a fucking 10000 pop servers.
---
And I don't think anyone is expecting blizzard to not cap the servers and let 10000 people login to the same server at the same time.
---
&gt;We also haven't had thousands of players rushing to a single realm at the same time.
---
On launch day yes you did. There were probably more people playing on Vanilla wow launch day then there will be for classic launch day. 
---
In a PuG, everyone needs to avoid drama. In a guild group, we'd obviously give it to the warrior.
---
I would love this so much.  Fuck those greedy assholes.
---
Remember Hakkar runs?
---
It's because you aren't a true RPG player and it's obvious.
---
Fuck those statues 
---
I remember the ques as well. Mostly from friends crying and complaining in ventrilo. Living in eastern europe ment i was home when most were still in school/working, and having a stable cable internet ment i never got disconnected. 
---
Oh the sweet tears.
---
You're completely missing the point.
---
One is a one-off occurance. The other is ridiculous.
---
Yeah, they will...but 100g / hour? You are crazy. More like 40-50g / hour and IF THEY ARE ALONE in the area, which they won't be.
---
Voice chat when integrated was rejected even back then when voice chat providers were balkanized. Now that for better or worse the gaming community seems to have standardized on Discord, the case for built-in voice coms is even weaker.
---
You know what you couldn't have in vanilla flying gank squads. See what i did i refuted your point and ignored the rest. Btw flying didn't destroy world pvp doom lord kazzak area for example.
---
No Kids But our guild is filled with mostly people that are 30+ come check our discord out! [https://discord.gg/M6g27d](https://discord.gg/M6g27d)
---
While technically correct, this serves no purpose other than an attempt to belittle the content creator and unveil your pettiness.
---
OP, these maps are a delight to look at, please do not be discouraged.
---
While Elemental is good past 40, 2H Enhancement using RB while Earthbind kiting is considered the fastest. This was confirmed by Melderon following Kargoz's levelling guide.
---
Keep in mind, I'm not saying the best, just that it can be faster based on the numbers. Based on my playing, earthbind kiting is huge although slightly annoying sometimes. The amount of downtime, as long as you manage your mana effectively, is very efficient.
---
Congratz on letting someone else dictate your playstyle lmao
---
LMAO !
---
"BRD AoE farming as mage".
---
By the time a MAGE will have the gear to do that, DM will be open.
---
The troll sections are terrible.  The Hakkar section isn't too bad, I actually like that bottom ring
---
Would be cool
---
16 hours per day? Does that take into account rest and bathroom/food breaks, besides sleep?
---
Unless you plan on poopsocking it, I'd say 10-12 hours effective leveling per day is close to what is possible. Only hardcore speedlevelers will play more than that.
---
I myself plan to take a week off from work, which gives me 9 days of full on no-life gaming.
---
With an average of 9,5 hours of effective leveling per day for 9 days, I calculate my character reaching lvl 47.
---
I predict final ding sometime within 9-10 days after that (playing 5-6 hours effectively on weekdays and 8-9 hours in weekends).  
---
I find this as close to hardcore as I can get without losing my shit and maybe burning out.
---
How is deadmines going to ruin the economy? 
---
...and furthermore, if the guy refusing to go wasn't the healer, just kick his ass out...dps are a dime a dozen.  As a tank you should just make your own groups and run them how you want.  
---
That isn't a world I live in and it's a silly assumption you made
---
About as sound as your nonsense reasoning for a fundamental change to classic being implemented. 
---
I admit I used it a little during BfA Beta, to explain tacts to people who had never entered the new dungeons. Figured it might be a similar situation with re-visiting the old dungeons for many. 
---
Yea, this has been my assumption all along, but I thikn anywhere betwen late June and early August is a reasonable expectation.
---
Remember though we'll also have multiple servers, not just one. And the sharding of 1-10 can be dynamically adjusted to roughly control the flow of people into the 10-20 zones solving the problem.
---
Cool, TIL
---
Iirc there was a fairly high level requirement and imo it was only worth it to complete the quests in conjunction and then get back to grinding.  I think you wanted to get honor for a 10% price reduction on a mount as well.  
---
and as an ally option?
---
Imagine being to fragile that you get upset when someone doesn't like your stuff. 
---
;)
---
&gt; world buff stacking won't be a thing
---
I remember world buff stacking from back then. This is an incorrect conclusion to draw from a mechanic that prevented scroll stacking.
---
&gt; The thing is if you want to do every piece of content with only one spec
---
nah only until around t2 or so
---
God damned if these aren’t amazing
---
Voidwalker bubble ruins everyone's good time lol.
---
Well id agree but US cucks already fucked us over by whining about DM being available on launch. dont expect bg being available from the get go either.
---
The warrior doesn't need it unless he's going to be playing in a top guild and looking to top the meters. So it likely doesn't change his experience in any way, other than he's butthurt for a few minutes. Cry me a river. 
---
The number of times I've been in groups and someone has "needed" an item but not equipped it. Fuck that.
---
Everyone "earned" that reward, so everyone should get a chance on it. It's not some BoE blue worth 30g. I'm all for need over greed then. But if it's an epic mounts worth, then everyone should have a fair chance at it.
---
You're not some special snowflake just because you rolled warrior.
---
People didn't need it back in 2004, so why would they need it now?
---
Using 3rd party software is much better IMO. 
---
Why is it ridiculous?  You apparently need the gold so why not just roll on everything? 
---
Lots of players never even see a boe epic drop, why shouldn't they being allowed to make gold as well?
---
I can't argue against that.
---
I literally can't.
---
Care to weigh in with an argument or even an opinion?
---
Yeah, lots of options, and there aint a real answer. If you run into a HC or even semi HC raiding guild, then engineering is suddenly a must have profession. Leveling engineering (on private servers at least) costs somewhere from 80g to 200g. So it aint that bad. Remember that every respec you do in classic is going to be 50g. 16 slot bags sell for 2-5g, a mooncloth around 20g, mooncloth bag is about 24 to 30g. At best profit for tailoring is just making mooncloth, and selling the other materials you dont need. This is where most crafting professions fall short, after everyone has the item they need, they dont need it anymore. 
---
Take enchanting, crusader enchant recipe is usualy worth around 100g. For that 100g you can pay an enchanter 50 times for an enchant (2g enchant fee is pretty average).
---
How did he get upset in any form?
---
Well you did Tirisfal after all.
---
Those un-instanced areas of Uldaman contain a few quests. It's a common occurrence to meet a party of the opposing faction going for the same quest objective in the same room, fighting mobs close by. Naturally, somebody gets sloppy with their AoE and one thing leads to another and it's world PvP in an enclosed space, along with some Elite mobs. Great fun!
---
The hidden parth for shaman quest is missing :S
---
Still awesome work!
---
too*

/u/Ionic_Pancakes reply to you belongs on /r/MurderedByWords.

---
I'd like to do the southern End of Durotar next, but it'll take a few hours and I haven't got the time until after Work tomorrow, but that is coming next I think, along with perhaps another part of elwyn forest, or maybe Dun Morogh, Need to contribute content to both factions
---
Actually, solmyrgarde's post is just about perfect. There is skill involved so don't kid yourself. That is not to say that all rank 14's are the most skilled at wow, but you cannot just afk to 14. You need to develop a system and a group of teammates in order to achieve it and doing so takes social skills, determination, and patience. 
---
I would love more than anything to hit rank 14 come Classic, but I know for a fact that I won't be able to due to my life and schedule. That doesn't mean I whine like a 2 year old toddler because I'm jealous of my neighbor Timmy who got something I can't. It means I appreciate what I do have.
---
Life is not fair. Deal.
---
"true" hahaha, I've been an RPG player my whole life, just some random assumption because I don't share the popular opinion on this subredit.
---
&gt;With BfA came a feature that made it easier to communicate 
---
Didnt they implement the voice Chat back in Cata, or even WotLk? Cant remember anyone using it though rofl
---
How so? One day is not enough time to organise people from multiple social groups in multiple countries, on multiple platforms to group on one server.
---
Dun Morogh!!
---
Claiming everyone enjoyed his other stuff also served no purpose, other than to inflate the value of his work to garner more upvotes.
---
Also he has no right to speak for me. If someone claims i think a certain way when I don't I'm going to correct them. 
---
LK dungeons/heroic dungeons were just a loot pinata for most players. It's sad how Blizzard turned WoW from a masterpiece of game design to something designed more for revenue generation.
---
If you can't get Dartol's there's no reason to even return. 100%, if I return or not depends on this.
---
You can still get griefed by mages spam sheeping your mobs tho :P
---
The problem with ilevel is this: where do you go? There are only so many combinations of the strength, agility, intellect, spirit and stamina - whats the point of leveling to 70 beating the hardest raids and pushing when the gear is barely an upgrade? 
---
Would you replay raids over and over again for a 1-2% increase over the whole expansion? If not then what is that number? - blizzard says its about 8% - what has lead to the ilevel inflation we have now, because without resets the power grows exponentially with each tier. 
---
ZG fills in so many slot gaps for casters.  MC had pretty much nothing for wand, cloak, ring2, shoulders, boots, legs, head, and wrists for offensive casters aside from T1.  But that still left nothing for cloak, ring2, and wand.     
---
if you had cooldowns then yeah rogues were great in a 1v1, but in a BG situation the shadow priest will likely not be alone and you're gonna get your face melted off.
---
Hold on, is it not Furblog? Have I been wrong for all these years? 
---
Such an expensive item like that i will need without a question if it's not a friend or a guildie.
---
OK, so the enchanter rolls need on everything since he wants to DE. Everyone else in the group also rolls need since they want to sell. End result = no change. 
---
It's ridiculous to expect to roll need on EVERY item. When it's one item that goes beyond a threshold of hundreds of gold, then it's unfair to give it to any one person. They did nothing to deserve it any more than anyone else
---
Need to figure out when/how the pvp system should be implemented. I would be down for them adding the honor system relatively quickly (about halfway through phase 1, or at the start of phase 1). Then add in the 1.11 rank 14 gear (new shield, relics, swiftblade) down the road closer to AQ40 release. BUT allow ex rank 14 players to have the ability to purchase the new rank 14 gear when it is added to the vendors down the road. Rank 14 is no easy feat by any means and if someone is willing to do that grind, then I feel like they should be able to purchase the gear, without having to do the grind again.
---
Oh, I agree! 
---
Just interested in what you guys think. 
---
I kind of doubt I’ll bother with adding people to discord for a casual deadmines run with randoms though, whereas I might would’ve used the integrated chat to call for CC on certain mobs etc.
---
However, after reading through the responses it doesn’t seem like anyone want to bother with that, haha!
---
Lmao, what is this new trend on this sub where when people get called out for being a dick for something they said, they just say the other person is fragile... Eh no, your just an ass hole
---
ST is basically already "wings." The basement is totally independent, but is where you do 2 quests with some nice rewards.
---
Hakkar has some great drops and is needed for a quest with very strong rewards as well, all you have to do to get to him from the zone line is take 2 of the green dragon pulls.
---
Then if you want to go all the way with Eranikus, you do have to do the top Troll ring, clear green dragons, and clear the troll priest before getting to him. However if you only do that, it's now a normal sized zone.
---
Personally I prefer this setup. You can treat it as wings, but if you want to do the whole thing there's some overlap too to save some work. I'm hopeful that with more older people playing this time around, we'll see more of these small directed groups who are just hitting pieces of zones like ST, BRD, and LBRS since that's how they can keep it manageable.
---
This would be so hilarious and awesome. Even if they made it as a gimmick (launcher UI option) :)
---
RPVE 4 lyfe!
---
(or "ERPVE 4 yiff", if you're *that* kind of person..)
---
Man, people would love your kind of maps in D&amp;D. Please love D&amp;D and do this.
---
Is that why you're so bitchy?
---
And you think the rogue is alone in BG situations? :p They strike when your lovley priest wasted the fear and shield.
---
I would pay for printed maps of these zones.
---
The flip side is you can start the quest early, but you don't need to finish it until 60. Encouraging you to get multiple runs out of BRD is kinda the point of the quest design.
---
...I think we can take "they're using 7.3.5 client" as fact, seeing as it's not very easy to just shift everything over to another client architecture.
---
With BfA came a feature that automatically grouped you and all party members to a common voice chat. You need to bind a «push-to-speak» button and when used all members will hear you, unless they turn it off manually.
---
I think that if Blizz is going to leave loot trading in Classic to save on time and tickets, they're probably going to leave Master Loot mechanics in Classic as well, which will negate Ninja Looting, unless it's the master looter who ninjas lol.
---
People have a lot of class loyalty, myself included. However the broadest consensus was that during all of classic, rogues were OP. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw)
---
If it's useless people just skip the content. Low level groups bust out a ton of quests on the city side and call it a day. Higher level groups cut a path straight to the emperor. Some groups only go as far as the bar to see the vendor and quest mobs. The nonlinearity of BRD is amazing and has never really every been touched by any other instance in the history of WoW. 
---
If you run a dungeon with one cloth wearer and every boss drops only cloth items that are upgrades for them is it fair that they get them all? They did nothing more than the rest of the party and are no more deserving of drops. 
---
Weeeeell that one was me. Lol.
---
Really, the fairest thing to do is sell them and split the profits but GL with that
---
&gt; butthurt for a few minutes. Cry me a river. 
---
Do you really talk like this in real life to people you run into on the street?  Seriously who talks like this except the most inept of social rejects?  I'm going to *assume* you're born in 83 based on your name.  I'm an 84 child myself.  You're 35+, act like it.  Stop talking like this.  Stop acting like a greedy tool.  Stop acting like a complete and selfish asshole just because you're in an online game.  Your "anonymity" isn't as anonymous as you'd like, but that isn't justification to act like your suggesting.  You'll probably come back with a retort or witty come back like "fuck you" or "stop telling me what to do".  Noone is telling you what to do.  **Act like a better person**. It's been 14 years since most of us have played.  There's no excuse to behave like this.  I'm not saying I *never* acted greedy or like an asshole similar to what you are describing in the past, but that is the point of life: to grow up and become better versions of ourselves.
---
&gt; The number of times I've been in groups and someone has "needed" an item but not equipped it. Fuck that. Everyone "earned" that reward, so everyone should get a chance on it. 
---
So your falling for the Prisoner's Dilemma then in terms of loot rolling.  Because you ran into a few bad situations (which statistically, *and this has been proven COUNTLESS times*, stick with you in your memory more than the mundane/regularly good situations) with a ninja or a person being unscrupulous you're allowing your fear of being "hit" again by another future ninja rule your emotions.
---
He isnt true. 
---
DW = a quest 
---
Posions = a quest

Backstap and sap are learned from the trainer directly. 
---
It definitely did from what I remember. I only got up to the 3rd boss in AQ. 
---
I don’t remember heaps of shit, like I never finished Dire maul once.
---
I think the games just too big for us to remember it all!
---
People can only see your rolls if they're in your group.
---
Rule 1: Negotiate what part of the instance you'll be doing before getting there. The best way is just build the group yourself and advertise that you are not running the basement.
---
How did this 5 year old get on his parents reddit account? 
---
Abbey 😎
---
The only way it should be altered is by allowing rank 14 players to purchase the new rank 14 gear after it is added (like the relics, shield, staff, swiftblade, etc).
---
Ya... because it’s probability 
---
This is a pretty awful conclusion of the relic slot
---
Oh thats new
---
I remember the voice Chat Interface somewhere hidden in the social tab and actually sometimes seeing a single Person in there. I never bothered trying to communicate with it though
---
Oh yeah I get that, but a LOT of people don't see it. Maybe it can be put down to "hand holding" but it worked really well in SM, while people don't "see" the sections really in ST, just a massive, sometimes feeling aimless slog. 
---
i'll look into it. :)
---
Hi, /u/Gothlander
---
Oh! I stand corrected.
---
just like a warrior can dps without edgemasters lol you're not very good at this.
---
I can PM  you the HQ versions of these uploads and you're more than welcome to print them. :)
---
I love dispelling stuff as a priest. It's my #1 priority even over healing in BGs.  I really enjoy watching melee players and hunters disintegrate casters with zero buffs/magic-shields.  :)
---
But yeah
---
Yes, since they're all BoP and of negligible value to anyone else. 
---
You're trying to apply "1 rule for everything" to a situation that requires nuance.
---
I love you. 
---
What are you wanting to farm? Because certain classes farm differently.
---
I agree
---
it's in the new version I just havent downloaded it from my portal yet, but it's coming :P
---
Wings with separate instances coulda been a really cool use of the area outside of the zone, where groups would have to head back out into uninstanced content to swap wings leading to more wpvp encounters. C'est la vie.
---
Cool story bro
---
I'm not very convinced about loot trading, just have GMs not sort that out
---
The warrior is the asshole here for not generously giving everyone a chance to win the lottery. Nah, apparently he wants it all for himself. Egoistical is that called.
---
Fine, I give it to him because it's not worth 1000g on a fresher server but only 100 or 200g. Will he then help me for 5 hours (that's the time it takes me to generate 100g) on other stuff? No he won't. Why? Because he will feel entitled to the edgemaster. The rest of the party can go to hell.
---
And that's why everyone roll need. To not be that egoistic guy that feels entitled to super rare world drops. 
---
You actually need to be attuned to use this orb, what's the problem?
---
Getting unfairly silenced is fast way to get those who reported you without reason banned
---
Wow, thank you for such an informative and well thought out post!  I'm so glad you provided evidence to the contrary proving my line of thinking wrong!  /s
---
Yeah it's gonna be rough running blues and greens until DM comes out.  But honestly unless you're going to power-level to 60 DM will likely be released or near release by the time you get there.  And if you are going to power level, it means you're probably going to raid and you can get a good set of gear for a mage from MC + Ony.   
---
yeah but most players are average at best and don't remember to use dispell/decurse against other players in pvp...especially world pvp when they're not expecting it.
---
Friday June 21st - the first day of summer.  I promise you won't be disappointed 
---
Well you can't really look at it without nostalgia because you have no way experiencing it at the moment. Even if you go play on private servers it won't be the same experience because there's a lot of data the developers doesn't have access to. So right now you are basically just using nostalgia as a definition of what it WASN'T but you are not more objective than anyone else, sorry.
---
Is this the starting zone for Orcs? Where can I see more of your work?
---
Yeah, I don't have a good solution for it all.
---
Someone smarter than me would have to come up with the answers, and it's a very ambitious idea from the ground up.
---
I guess what I would want is kinda like the pristine servers that blizzard hinted at before, but it would still come with some of the problems which made me leave the game. I'm not sure if powercreep is that big of an issue in the grand scale of things.
---
Lfd most likely.
---
I was never in a Wrath era LFD run but I’d imagine it was pretty horrible for leveling pugs. 
---
It is based on the modern client, and modern macros will work (also some 1.12 macros are impossible now, or will need to be rewritten to match the new format).
---
Especially the music. Reminds me of my youth and innocence in life and in game.

Equip: [Improves your chance to hit with spells by 1%.](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=23727)
---
Depends on what guild us doing.
---
I just think advertising Rogues as some be-all-end-all of PvP is a bit rich, they are great in WPvP because they can of course dictate the fight... But in BGs they were very limited due to their high cooldowns.
---
Having an equal shot at winning an item that everyone contributed to doesn't make you a douche lol 
---
It takes 5 people to run a dungeon, all people are contributing and everyone gets a fair chance by rolling for it. 
---
They mostly just removed the “maze” section, as they called it. E.g. that section in the middle past the Stego, with the flying lightning lizards. 
---
Pugs used to get comically confused in that section. 
---
It seems to me that Blizz is going for a more automated system and less GM activity in general, so it makes sense that they will implement as many game mechanics as they can that take the place of needing GMs to actually do any work.
---
WoW != real life. Stop applying real life logic to video games.
---
What are the chances in real life, you're going to be in a situation, with 4 totally random people and you stumble across some sort of treasure? Approximately zero. Let's pretend it happens anyway and let's say it's a valuable antique. One of you happens to be an antiques dealer. In your world, you give him the priceless antique because that's his job.
---
In the real world either
---
A) We all ask him how much it's worth. He lies and rips us all off
---
B) We all ask him how much it's worth. He's honest, arranges a sale and splits the profits with us
---
The fairest solution in any BoE epic situation worth ~400g+ is to sell it and split the proceeds.
---
&gt; One huge aspect of why vanilla is loved by so many, is because of the community aspect on each realm, you know people by their name, by their race, and *even by their hair and skin color.*
---
I mean, sure, I might remember that troll priest with the green mohawk, but other than that, it's stretching it.
---
Realm transfers always were expensive, and they are just a tool to allow people to play with together with friends. Sure, one in a hundred transfers might be abused to make account sells less obvious, but with the cooldown (was it 1 or 2 months per character?) it's okay. I don't see any reason to deny people the fun of playing with their friends just to *mildly inconvenience* someone who buys a character or has a bad reputation.
---
I've been looking for that dumb zelda chocolate thing for 10 years.
---
So classic was an actual adventure. Current wow just seems like a sprint to the end game which turns out is just a shitty slot machine
---
For duels, SL warlock. 
---
Don’t seem to recall that happening much in Vanilla. My leveling guild did ST quite a lot. Was that an actual problem then at some point? Or more of a PServer issue?
---
Worked great for me, but I also generally preferred to save my mana for healing and would partner with people so spent my mana healing them. 
---
I think your response is part of what's awesome about vanilla. As much as people like to raise claims of cookie-cutter talents and builds, there really is a lot of customization opportunity in the simplest of talents to tune your character to how you like to play the game.
---
I have a question for y'all from retail - what is the biggest difference between retail and vanilla macro system? Can I still use my basic vanilla macros in the new system? Not trying to do any /scripts or difficult macros, just wondering if the basic commands like /cast, /use etc have a different form in the retail system. Thanks!
---
Agree. Same thing with warlocks and drain mana - totally underrated. Smart locks can beat priests pretty easily even with their ability to dispel corruption, SL...all you guys have to do is spam some cheap fire casts with a curse ticking and wait for interrupt CDs to be up and then load up DOTs during a fear and spam drain mana. Drain mana is fucking OP and it's rarely used on me. 
---
I mean, if you're following the guide successfully there shouldn't be a whole lot of other folks in STV when you get there at least.
---
Do you know anyone who has ever used the inner BWL portal?
---
It all matters.
---
It's not acting like they're geniuses for it, it's that it's a good system and prolongs the lifespan of the game. If anything, people are surprised we got any amount of progressive itemization, especially with regards to the 1.10 gear and Dire Maul.
---
Also, there ARE a lot of no changers that really want the official pserver experience without the shady people running the show. There are a lot of pserver vanilla players that will have to come to terms with a different vanilla.
---
I more or less saw the comment as reprimanding pserver no changers that only wanted no changes from the pservers instead of the authentic Vanilla WoW experience.
---
While I understand and even sympathize a little with the sentiment behind Progressive Itemization, in reality the very min/maxers that it's meant to stymie would just do the equivalent of turtling from PVP video games.
---
excuse me? #NOCHANGES 
---
&gt; And I don't think anyone is expecting blizzard to not cap the servers and let 10000 people login to the same server at the same time.
---
Would you rather sit in an hours long queue? Asking players to do that on the launch of a game is business suicide.
---
&gt; On launch day yes you did. There were probably more people playing on Vanilla wow launch day then there will be for classic launch day.
---
Source? Cause what I'm looking at is:
---
&gt; [Within the first day, over 200,000 players created World of Warcraft accounts. By 5:00 p.m. PST, over 100,000 were playing the game concurrently.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20041201005524/en/World-Warcraft-Shatters-Day-One-Sales-Records)
---
So we've got around 100k people playing at once on launch day. That's *people playing at the same time*, not *people logging in all at once when the servers went live*.
---
And we know that WoW launched with [88 servers](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Timeline_(World_of_Warcraft)#2004) for the US.
---
Now, there is no way in anyone's imagination that Classic WoW is going to launch with 88 servers. No. Way.
---
We've got 56k subs here. The majority of that 56k are going to be on at launch. That's just this sub. Then you've got people who don't sub here, then you've got the tourists, etc. etc.
---
TLDR: Basically we will have well over 100k people who will be trying to log in to well less then 88 servers all at the same time to share 6 zones.
---
I want to play Vanilla.
---
I know it isn't purist, but seeing this reminds me why I'm glad Blizz opted to retain the modern raid frame architecture for classic.  
---
Also, I presume that in combat you will have scrolling text and boss mod bars filling up that little bit of open space above your character? ;)
---
&gt; While im apathetic towards loot trading, I think you're ignoring the important aspect of, people rolling need for their friends.
---
I see this argument all the time and believe it's vastly overstated how common this will actually be.  And there's no way it's going to 'ruin' WoW Classic.
---
Also happy cake day.  
---
I was watching this vanilla duel tournament that they held in strangle thorn valley arena and the locks were beaten by rogues, aside from this I don’t know if anyone else countered them? I guess part of what we have to look at is what class has the least counters.
---
Them 17 inch screens, what a mess :)
---
great advantage when Classic comes out is, that we all have Wider Screens and more Space for all those Bars and Icons.
---
So what if I level all the way to 60 and then it turns out the population on my server is super low and people are just constantly leaving the server because of low population and now I'm stuck on a crap server with my character that I spent so much time working on.  I would want to be able to transfer to a higher population server at that point, and would be willing to pay for it.
---
If the loot trading that retail has IS implemented, needing on the item will make it soulbound.
---
So if you were intending to sell it, you would have to greed for it.
---
I'm saying they should have changed it from the start. No chance now :p
---
i thought the same... we all have jobs now man :D, its not 2005 anymore
---
They could add "Seasons" like in Diablo, where they start from scratch, or they could implement a polling system where people can vote on changes or new content, like in OSRS.
---
Thank you! Being open for donations would be cool tho
---
Case closed, many thanks. 
---
Of course if transfers are available from launch, it would be advantageous to purposely pick the lowest pop server possible for easier leveling, then transfer to high pop.  But I have a feeling that if transfers are ever available, it wouldn't be until like a year after launch or something.
---
It's another post like the rest, move along.
---
I don't think you're going to find many here who share your opinions. In the same way you don't understand how outleveling a zone and running back to trainers is fun, many of us simply don't think enemy scaling and stuff is fun. Different strokes for different folks and all that.
---
No pallypower?
---
You can do this on ships in booty bay to ratchet too, that's the worst move :P
---
If you could that would be awesome, thank you!
---
To be honest it would be worth it at that level.
---
Exactly. I think this was during my "all the addons" phase :D
---
Yeah, I was on campus at a tech school so I had to wait in queue, but once I was in it was solid so I never had to wait twice. And I played so much at the time that I was rarely in queue.
---
Oh absolutely. It's just not needed for casual runs with randoms. Higher level stuff such as raids, it's essentials. But random runs, no. Just start killing things. Use markers on mobs if you need to, but other than that it's pretty straight forward. 
---
So only two zones so far? Can't wait to see more.
---
This isn't even the same person though.
---
That's....not how behavior works in a group setting, nor is he even thinking that selfishly.  So because you put some arbitrary value on an item that anything less than 25g is "ok to roll for need on" and anything greater isn't, he now owes you something?  
---
Last I checked everyone put in the same effort thus far in the dungeon.  The entire system your proposing breaks down when you start saying that people "owe you" for winning rolls, it doesn't matter if it's a boe or not.
---
Suppose someone just got very lucky and some gear dropped in a dungeon that was bop mail, but you're a rogue.  You walk away from that dungeon with nothing more than 1 quest completed, and maybe 1-2 gold in trash you can vendor.
---
Does that shaman/hunter/warrior owe you time now because they got lucky with their BoP drops?  What if they won some "crappy" (according to you) blues that you didn't care about?  Do you hold that against them now too?
---
See how this arbitrary ruleset isn't as "set in stone" as you think?  Maybe another group comes along that has the same mentality but they view ANY BOE blues as free-for-all, where you may only view high value BOE's as a free-for-all.
---
Oh, there's nothing egotistical about wanting an upgrade.  People would make the same argument that Warrior 1: shouldn't roll on &lt;X&gt; weapon because it only increases his DPS by .6 but that Rogue needs that same weapon MORE because it increases his DPS by 2.1.  There's so many fallacies about the idea that someone rolling need on an upgrade is "entitled" because it's 1) subjective and 2) an upgrade is an upgrade no matter how small it is.
---
Let me simplify it down for you:
---
Example A:  Warrior says upon entering group "If Edgemasters drops, they are mine since they are BiS".  **That is entitled.**  
---
Example B: While in a group, Edgemasters drops.  Warrior says "can I have please?  BiS for my class/spec.".  That is not entitled.
---
&gt; *entitlement* has taken on a critical sense. If someone has a sense of entitlement, that means the person believes he deserves certain privileges — and he's arrogant about it. The term "culture of entitlement" suggests that many people now have highly unreasonable expectations about what they are entitled to. 
---
Someone demanding something is entitled.  Reserving items is a form of entitlement.
---
If a random item drops, regardless if it's BoE or not, and someone says "Can I need? That's an upgrade/BiS for me." That is the complete opposite of entitlement.  They are asking nicely.  
---
Dude Dun Morogh pleeeeeease! Great work I love these!
---
Yeah, my only interest in enhanting would be the firist few levels for the wands. I'll almost certainly level herb/skinner nad drop skinning at some point for tailoring or go straight to alch or eng. 
---
I wondr if there will be an add-on that shows both herbs and ore, because leveling with mining to help offset the cost of engineering would be great. Though I don't even think such an add-on exists on retail.
---
I understand this only restricts Dire Maul gear to a later content patch and then restricts notoriously powerful 1.10 gear to a MUCH later date.
---
Some is better than none :).
---
This could have its uses for example when BWL gets released on Classic and there might be a lot of people camping the mob who drops Blackhand's Command, which starts the BWL "attunement" quest which allows you to use the Orb to port into BWL. Meaning a guild could rather enter via UBRS and start the raid on release day instead of having to camp the mob for all 40 members.
---
Ts isnt that bad tbh, but yeah disc all the way probably
---
Not when I did this
---
Nobody cared when they introduced it in bc, and nobody does now either. Its not bad, but disc
---
I don't think Blizz is genius for doing this, nor do I think private servers suck - I am ragging on people who are adamant about a philosophy ("no changes") without actually understanding the full extent of that philosophy.
---
It’s useless because a full run is useless, imo. It’s not very nonlinear in that there are areas essentially grayed our because it’s too low or too high. 
---
If you’re going to make a nonlinear dungeon , I think it should be nonlinear across the intended level.
---
Its unique, but it could have been done more effectively .
---
I checked your history and all you do is bitch, little man
---
I mean maybe Americans did say that but I played on a couple of vanilla servers (I'm American) and everyone called it DM 
---
10 bubbles out of 10
---
Dey be downvoting me. Sigh, my humor is so hit and miss here.
---
Sure, you can discuss all the semantics here. But that's not the case here. The case here is that somewhere in vanilla someone decided that needing is always more important than greeding. Which is a system that fails to work beyond a certain item value.
---
Because beyond a certain item value, other motivators and emotions kick in. Which is perfectly human behavior. 
---
Many people will feel extremely sour and/or sad when the lottery drops and they have to let it go because someone in the group happens to be able to use it as an upgrade. If you fail to see that and think that these people should grow a pair, you fail some basic empathy for all I care. 
---
Everybody need = everybody equally happy at a chance to roll plus bonus that the item won't get ninja'd. And this is what the game should be all about.
---
You cannot compare purple high value epics with any other kind of BoP or low value BoE. Period.
---
&gt;Sit on your hands till they’re numb and jerk yourselfs off while enjoying classic and chill the fuck out.
---
Luckily for me, that is already what I'm doing.
---
Orc Warlock with some luck could beat some rogues ! (25% stun resist)
---
As a plate wearer in vanilla i remember this too well.  I recall looking into dungeons (mostly SM) that started dropping plate and getting a few pieces before hitting 40.  
---
As far as blowing money on the AH for gear to tank RFK, I would laugh at anyone who suggests it.  You are so poor after class and mount training at 40.  But it's best to do a little research on dungeon drops to replace that mail armor sooner than later.
---
Love your maps my dude. What do you use to make them?
---
Quite a few level 40 plate items have very similar armor values to those of mail.
---
Unnecessary asshole of the day award goes to you mate
---
Lucky EU neets
---
prolly other ways than DM? Idk if DM will be as farmable as before
---
Blame the ?? Horde who relentlessly gank redridge, stv, etc. We eventually get sick of it, get on our high level toon and skip through stonetalon
---
Well even as a tank I couldn’t get past them elites but to make for my jealousy against rogues who could in my free time I would a trap from them using a Savory Deviate Delight and some cheap ass water, I’d sit flagged drinking the water and waiting for any stupid opportunist rogue to have a go. 
---
Since sitting was as auto critical lot of rogues would usually open up with a backstab, which music to my ears because that gave me an opportunity to react and change to ‘serker stance from defensive. I particularly loved their reaction on realising that I was a tank and there best opener had only taken a third of my health. 
---
I bet lol RNG is a warlocks best friend 😂
---
Only SM ruin works as lock and that’s only good in premades 
---
&gt;The fairest solution in any BoE epic situation worth \~400g+ is to sell it and split the proceeds but since you can't trust 4 random people you've never met then it's fairest for everyone to roll need
---
So you're proving my point that you've fallen for the Prisoner's Dilemma.  You just provided the exact scenario where the 100% absolute fairest solution is to sell the item and split the gold.  So instead of splitting the gold, everyone absolves to just be selfish and greedy and hope they win it so they can keep ALL the gold for themselves.
---
Also, the example of real life antiques dealer is ....I can't even find words to describe this example.  If we are using classes as an allegory of real life careers, then a better example would be that each class has specific equipment we use.  A construction worker uses tools, a physicist uses spectrographs, a server admin uses network switches and blades.  
---
Just because you 3 of you come across a really expensive server blade doesn't mean that the server admin is entitled to it.  But you'd be hard pressed to argue that if you randomly found a 12 grand server blade sitting around somewhere that you'd know what to do with it beyond selling it.  
---
The construction worker can sell it sure.  The physicist can sell it too.  But the server admin can probably use it.  He has the knowledge (i.e. in game terms "experience") **to utilize it beyond it's monetary value.**
---
I’ve never leveled a regular human and never plan to, but it’s still a nice little starting area anyway
---
I don't play alliance but it makes me feel nostalgic. It's just that good
---
Elitest jerks. If you don't like the content, don't watch it. No need to be a dick about it.
---
Please please please do the deathknell (undead starting area).  These are fantastic
---
I guess we will find out in classic. Every class is strong in its own way, you can literally get bursted in a microsecond by an ench shaman you're unlucky.
---
But overall I would say Rogue, Mage, Shadow priests and Warlock. But vanilla is so much about timing stuns and all that, using engineering with grenades, etc etc. We'll see.
---
Based on my limited testing the quality seemed fine, and it was certainly convenient when grouped up with clueless players to help guide them through the dungeon. 
---
My biggest gripe with the system would be that people don’t expect to talk in voice chat during casual &amp; low level dungeons, so very few actually has a mic they can use, which in turn leads to terrible sound quality.
---
&lt;3
---
This is beautiful. You are exceptionally talented. Any way you can do Duskwood?
---
Hi, /u/Mydogfarts
---
Mhm
---
So am I to understand this means that the items will be full power, but items CREATED after 1.10 is what will not be dropping? so BRD will still be full of awesome blues and not just like 3 blues and 40 trash greens?
---
&gt; 4: The Burning of Stratholm
---
Never heard anyone call it that before.  We always just called it Live or Undead.
---
&gt;nolife to r14
---
&gt;now we can actually play the game
---
&gt;raid xroads
---
As far as we know, there is no vanilla only option and you can only buy it for both bfa and classic. This could change though
---
Isn't that banable griefing though?
---
Me too  
---
My first BRD run was a disaster. No one had done it before and it took one hour for everyone to get there and find the entrance. Then we got lost again and again inside. I think we died about 10times and spent 6h in that dungeon before calling it quits at emperor because all our gear was red. 
---
You could make maps for tabletop games like D&amp;D and print and monetize them. People pay good money for good quality! 
---
I couldn't disagree with you more. A huge part of any RPG-ish kinda of game is the feeling of character growth. Coming in at 52 and slogging your way through the city only to get stonewalled by fire elementals, then coming back in a few levels again and downing the 7D to wipe furiously at the lyceum, then come back again and now you're downing the emperor. In this way the game is using game mechanics to demonstrate to your your characters growth, it's wonderful.
---
11 bananas out of 10
---
Lol, you're getting destroyed, but aside from Strat, I completely agree with you.  UBRS, Scholo, Strat and SM were the only dungeons I really enjoyed running.  ZF, Mauradon and Dire Maul were also acceptable.
---
I pretty much hated the rest.  Avoided BRD, ST, etc., like the plague.
---
I haven't played retail in years but i know that pretty much every pServer guild ive been in shares a Gbank account because it really just streamlines a lot of stuff. plus then if someone has to take a break for IRL reasons or something its not as hectic. obviously its easier on pServers where its not pay to play but id assume hardcore end game guilds will look into doing something similiar
---
I figured I’d try something new and roll a mage, possibly troll. The one class I never really played on any version of wow
---
 It does make too much sense to not be a theory, even if it's a joke :p 
---
&gt;For some reason people keep bringing 1-2g value items into the argument, which is completely irrelevant. Try to make a case for 100+g items.
---
I used Edgemasters in my example.  *Please CITE where I referenced 1-2g value items.  PLEASE.*   I only even referenced &lt;25g BoE blues because that was the arbitrary value YOU introduced in your previous post.  Either stick with your ideology, or end the discussion, because waffling back and forth trying to have your cake and eat it too with verbal gymnastics is starting to wear on me.  
---
You're either greedy, and own up to it and just admit that your philosophy of needing on all boe blues/purples is greedy, or you're not.   You're trying to somehow justify that your philosophy of needing on everything **regardless if you can use it**, is not greedy.
---
&gt; For whatever reason I never did the pre-60 dungeons very much, so I remember little of them.
---
Mainly because from an efficiency standpoint, they weren't worth running.  I think I ran them all on my first 60, but barely touched any of them after that - other than SM, I typically just quested to 60.
---
I forget when, but I thought they blocked Polymorph from casting on targets you didn't tap during Classic for exactly this reason.  Totally possible that was TBC, though.
---
The idea is certainly cool, but I'd like to see it tried in another game, or retail.
---
Ideally a game should be built up with the idea of water travel in mind, or else it could just make the world feel even more empty is it's just tacked on later.
---
You mean you really hope that his/her hearthstone was NOT on cooldown. Anyway, this is a legit game mechanic and if you cannot deal with it I recommend playing tetris or something.
---
&gt; shortest and most straight to the point videos
---
Yeah, no. 
---
Not sure if you played rogue or not, but I did in a PvP guild and I didn't really feel like any class was a problem. Some was tougher than others, but I felt a lot stronger than any class.
---
So did everyone I played with, both rogues and other classes. 
---
Having two raid frames man... Gets me every time.
---
Time has proven again and again that dwarf priests are a minority. This was known back in Vanilla, it is known on pservers, it will be known in classic.
---
Way too few people like the dwarf priest asthetic, hence they wont play it. Im one of them. My priest either goes to horde or I go human/nelf depending on what cast animation I will prefer.
---
The 3,4 encounters are not worth all my time looking at an ugly gown-dwarf.
---
This captures my exact plan for this game, except for the dwarf and hunter part :)

That's not worth a downvote, you are correct. /u/InsaneWayneTrain has some pretty clear ideas on the kinds of game designs he enjoys and those he does not, and vanilla falls into the things he does not category. "Vanilla is not for you" is not a judgment of the player or the game, it's just observing a mismatch between personal preference and what a game offers.
---
Right. But at that point, you might as well make it wings like SM.
---
A huge part of RPG is nonlinearity, not necessarily nonlinearity with the asterisk of level ranges.
---
I think it would have been better if I had a ton of viable paths, so I'm not doing the same run 10 times in a row. 
---
It’s there for the same reason there’s a portal to MC in BRD and (what was going to be) Naxx in Startholme.  The original idea may have been to send in 40 guys and steam roll the place for lols before raiding, and then realized what a colossally silly idea that was.  
---
Fucking beautiful.
---
Yeah, sure, just like it doesn't matter what you say to flat earthers they still think the earth is flat :P
---
Like I said, I had a vanilla PVP title and I xferred my toon a ton and I never lost it and neither did anyone else I knew that had one, so again, you're remembering incorrectly.
---
Without 1.10 and ZG there are no items with spell hit, so how do you get even 5%?
---
Well if they don’t change too much then we should already have an idea but yup I feels
---
We thought they didnt, but they did. 
---
Fair enough, I was way off base with the Shaman totems then, didn't realise they were THAT big a chunk of spell damage relative to other gear. I'm admittedly more familiar with the Paladin ones (Alliance main), which are far less concerning disadvantage-wise when you can get +68 healing on your chest alone from the Strat robes. Like I said, they're still great items! But 53 healing to one spell kinda gets a bit more lost in the mix when pre-raid BiS (assuming no DM and 1.12 itemization) you're already at over 500 healing, is all.
---
Anyway, my bad on Ele totems. I'll amend my above statement; it depends on your class and spec, healers are at far less of a disadvantage overall than dps are due to the general 1.12 availability of +healing on gear compared to +spell damage and +attack power.
---
Not at all. The fairest solution just isn't going to happen in WoW with 4 randoms.
---
The NEXT fairest solution is to give everyone a roll.
---
The LEAST fair solution is to give it to one person because of some arbitrary condition.
---
You wanted to bring real world logic or morals into a video game. I gave you an example. 
---
Using your idea, my example still works. The antiques dealer uses his specialist knowledge to determine the value. And his specialist skills to sell for the right price. He still doesn't get the antique for himself. And neither does the network engineer get the £/$12k for nothing unless you're a moron.
---
If he wants to give us all £/$1000 then that's a different situation.
---
My fav is walking into Undercity front entrance and having music turned off but ambient full.   The hushed whispers in the courtyard and using Detect Invisibility will allow you to see the ghosts of the past haunting the grounds, the whispers are hard to make out but creepy when you hear it.   Stand by the fallen bell you can hear a faint bell ringing at the entry way proclaiming the death of King Terenas.  and walking down the hall you hear the faint cheering of hundreds of people welcoming Prince Arthas many years ago.   Then in the throne room, you hear the murmur of voices, once being "This kingdom shall fall, and from the ashes shall arise a new order that will shake the very foundations of the world."   If they only knew how true that statement was.
---
That is easily one of the small things that make me tear up.  People with so much love and heart developed this game, this classic adventure for millions to enjoy, and now it, like those in Lordaeron, is just a ghost of its former lively self.
---
i imagine classic servers will have have server pop limits though which pServers dont. idk. I've played at the start of plenty of pServers where there are thousands of people in starting zones, comparitvely if blizz caps servers at \~2.5k then release even without sharding would be much less congested then what a lot of people will be used to. if they played pservers that is.
---
Yes it does.  We all have different opinions, but yeah if you are a mage or hunter and need edgemasters, im ignoring you and i can live with myself.  Take your gold, i will hold onto my reputation
---
lol no
---
It's your experience, so do with this as you will, but I think you may be looking at this all wrong. One of the magical things about Classic WoW is that leveling and experiencing Azeroth and all it has to offer is a fun journey. Because it takes so long to level up to 60, you are required to travel to many, many different places in many different fashions... running across other players who are struggling through as well. It's not a race. Don't burn yourself out trying to hit 60 as fast as possible, because you may miss out on some of the magic of getting to 60 on your first toon in Vanilla.
---
 Assuming they do this shit properly, you will meet lots of friends who you run dungeons with, quest with, bullshit with.. World chat will make you laugh and cringe...and countless other things you are in for. The magic of WoW will never be truly recaptured as it was in 2004 but I do envy your position, being able to experience it through relatively fresh eyes. 
---
But yeah, don't be concerned with leveling fast or how long it will take, seriously. You're not gonna be one of the first players max level on your server, you won't even be one of the first few thousand. It will make no difference in the end. Retail WoW treats leveling as a chore, another shoddy mechanic which just time gates content at max level... in Classic WoW, leveling is a large amount of the content, and it can be fun as fuck if you take your time, goof around, and let Azeroth show you all the adventures she has to offer.
---
I'm referring to the WotLK caverns of time dungeon. One of a small few non-Vanilla dungeons to make it into my top 10.
---
See you're hitting on the relationship here between fight mechanics and class mechanics. You say you'd want to CC, interrupt, move out of AoEs etc as every role. Well what that does though is it homogenizes the exerpience between playing different classes. In vanilla design, the play difference comes from the class toolkits and the relationships between them. This even goes back into how much I hate Cataclysm leveling. They decided kill quests were boring, so now every other quest had to have some kind of vehicle or gimmicky shit. That doesn't make leveling more fun, it makes it less, as now my experience leveling on difference classes has become identical. Modern WoW does a great job of creating interesting fight mechanics, but in order to make sure any of the hundreds of class comps can complete those fights, they've had to homogenize the classes. Vanilla WoW had minimal fight mechanics and allowed novelty to emerge from dealing with the abilities and limitations of your group makeup.
---
What if the mad men just opened servers on a whim some random Tuesday with no announcement.
---
Pala quest is like 353g in raw gold plus one azerothian diamond, one pristine black diamond, 60 runecloth, 6 arcanite bars, 20 mana biscuits, 10 arthas' tears, 5 stratholme holy water, and like 2-3 dungeon runs.  
---
You should be able to have all of that farmed and banked before DM comes out and then just have to do your two quick runs in DM and Strat for your mount, and it really won't cost you more than like 500-600g.
---
You're right, I forget that when I did this I was playing on a private server that had dynamic respawns. I'm not sure how good it is with blizzard scripting, though I imagine it would be at least 40g an hour, which is a BIG deal on a new server when the economy is so small.
---
The best PvP items do not come from PvP.  Let go of your OCD.
---
Depends on the gear, but, I've been one of the most geared rogues in my server whole vaiinilla (2 years) noone could kill me except some goof-skill-geared hunters, 1 o 2 top skill and gear warloks, some ret pallyes busting all iwins including lay on hands, and some 1 o 2 top geared warriors.
---
Yeah I've seen a lot of mention of osrs. I play a lot of osrs and am fairly active on the subreddit. I feel like the polling system is a great idea, I do, however, feel like osrs players are much more accepting of both:
---
- Adding New content as in new areas, raids, bosses, etc.
---
- Adding content that exists in RuneScape 3 but made in a way that fits the osrs feel and gameplay.
---
It seems like a majority of people are only interested in vanilla wow and don't want anything changee. I understand this to some degree and I've seen mention of keeping select realms as vanilla and allowing others to include expansions.   I think the best way to go about it would be like how the osrs developers go about their updates.
---
Currently, in osrs, a poll has just passed to release [The Elf City] into the game. This city exists in RuneScape 3 but is referred to by the majority of the osrs community as a terrible game breaking update (very much how many wow players view certain expansions). The osrs developers took this content from their "retail" game and were able to redevelop it in a way that sticks to the core old school gameplay while still offering something fresh and exciting to its players.
---
An issue shortly after the osrs servers started was how the developers were going to produce new content as they had to stick to the lore that already existed. But they have proved that it's possible to enjoyably revisit lore that already exists and experience it with "vanilla" gameplay. They have also shown that it's possible to write new lore that people will enjoy. It all comes down to the way the game feels to the players.
---
Even though it would take a lot of time and resources, I believe developing the existing expansions again with a vanilla take on it would be for the greater good of classic. I also don't think they should be afraid of rewriting parts of the lore or creating different expansions. Because, as osrs has shown, lore, much like history, is written by the victors, and osrs has defeated RuneScape 3. Classic WoW will have the chance to defeat retail.
---
Wow Valley of Trials really is just a hut, some boar farms and a cave huh?
---
Noone cared because the voice chat introduced in BC were pure garbage.
---
you're the only one who's upset
---
you were so upset at the thought of being included in "everyone" that you had to comment just to let us know
---
we don't give a fuck tho you fucking pussy
---
It already had the classic portal and music in the Blizzcon demo
---
When BWL was first released the attunement quest for the orb didn't exist. The only entrance was inside the UBRS dungeon. 
---
I mean I currently play a fire mage and assassination rogue in bfa so I’m just torn between which to choose  
---
Wouldn't have it any other way.
---
What else are you supposed to do with R14 weapons other than plant them securely into some town defenders head?
---
The abbey is inside the valley.
---
My tauren on a private server (can't remember which) was called Bullstool
---
Yeah liking  old St is basically a hate crime.
---

My favorite dungeon
---
I'd like the option to change hair, skin, etc through the barber shop. I don't really care about server changes. Race changes Id rather not have and faction changes I'm completely against. If the character changes aren't available I will just model edit. 
---
As I recall it's tied to bnet integration, actually it's part of the bnet client itself, so by default it'll be usable in classic regardless of whether it's directly integrated into the game.
---
I support all of this as long as blizz is quick to handle realm population issues.  I dont want to be stuck on a realm with no one on it.
---
yes it is you absolute retard lmao
---
imagine rolling need on cloth because you're loot jelly  
---
you fucking cuck  
---
I think you are trying to justify a gaming principle which doesn't equate to real life.  People IRL are altruistic and more generous then they act online.  Online currently is a caustic toxic cesspool of memes and copy-paste chat.  
---
We'll have to agree to disagree, but my point is: you can justify it however you want: at the end of the day the "monetary value" principle as you are calling it now, is still attempting to justify denying someone an upgrade in the sense of "fairness".
---
No Pallypower. 0/10
---
iirc, R10 gear is pretty bad for ele
---
I don't get this argument.  To me it seems like it's no different than reserves.  It's just people saying "we put in 2/5 or 3/5 of hte effort, so we should get 2/5 or 3/5 of the say in where the loot goes".
---
If a warrior and a paladin are both in a group, and a piece of plate drops that they can both use and need, why can't they both roll on it, and then if one of them wins it decide together which of them it most benefits?  Why do they have to let fate decide which of the two of them gets it?   It doesn't diminish anyone else's chance of getting it, it just gives those two players a bit of agency in where the loot lands IF one of them wins it.
---
Also thank you!
---
If you ever do some for Storm Peaks or any of the forested Kalimdor zones I'd love to get them printed and framed :D

teldrassil and ashenvale music

I stated this in another post, but, I envy you!
---
Classic WoW is great because there are multitudes of "paths" to max level. And don't worry, you're gonna get curb stomped no matter what you do so embrace it! I would honestly suggest **stop researching things** and go into this game with as little knowledge as possible. Instead, ask people in chat how to do things or "level 20 where do i go next"... this encourages socialization(the most important feature of Classic WoW) and allows you to fumble through it in your own way while meeting people who may be lost too. 
---
I would recommend just launching the game when Classic releases, make your character on the same server/faction as some of your buds(assuming you have any who are interested in Classic), and just play the game.
---
I have. In a 10man UBRS group after the run for shits and giggles.
---
The dungeons in retail are very different from vanilla. I've just started playing retail after a 13 tear hiatus and they're much shorter and flashier than I remember.
---
Vanilla instances were all huge. Blizzard fully intended for people to have similar experiences running level 20 dungeons as they would running level 60 five mans (though granted nothing matches the sheer size of BRD unless maybe you count LBRS and UBRS as one dungeon).
---
It's all good.  I just think the relics are too specific and too contextual to really just give a blanket statement as you originally did.
---
Like the shaman relic that reduces the cooldown of reincarnate obviously can't be quantified as easily as the Lightning Bolt relic, but it tends to be used a lot more because it's easier to acquire; but it's not really a "bis" relic or anything, know what I mean?
---
The armor values are actually higher on (some*) pservers than they were in classic, so that is not the reason.
---
*Pservers that want to be blizzlike have now lowered the armor values to match how they were in classic.
---
For sure
---
Gotcha, so mainly gold farm. Rogues are decent gold farmers through pick pocketing in places like BRD. Druids are decent aoe farmers as well, through utilizing hots/thorns/bear/faerie/insect swarm. I would solo farm specific boe enchants inside dungeons that people were after on my druid, or aoe farm world mobs like furbolgs. 
---
Rogues are in demand for raid slots, but there are a lot of rogues so there is pretty good competition. Druids are in demand to a lesser point, but fewer people play druids, so it SORTA balances out.
---
Alright, I see! Thanks for the clarification.
---
This chest will be crazy good then, if it's not going to be affected by the progressive itemization.
---
A better solution is to say GMs wont trade items.  Blizz just changed their roll out based on feedback so we arent going to roll over and take this either.
---
Yeah I plan on for the first time playing a human I think for classic, will be new for me but still it's always been a nice cute little zone with seemingly real story
---
This is the correct answer. The original idea was for those big raids to actually be apart of the smaller instances. MC for example was originally another part of BRD.
---
Have you thought about drawing dungeon maps? They could even be integrated into a prettier version of Atlas!
---
Blizz did not say it will be in classic.  They said they were looking at it. 
---
my birthday is next week.  /need beta, blizz plz.
---
10 to 14 days. I suggest not doing that because there is nothing worse then getting to 60 and then be brunt out on the game to the point where it feels like a job and not a game but to each their own.
---
It’s called inkarnate. It lets you paint brush tool the roads, trees, mountains etc, and then drag and drop objects like buildings onto a map. I use it for my DnD group. Pretty cool utility, takes maybe 30 minutes to make a crazy detailed map.
---
Isn’t it a raid quest drop, meaning it drops for everyone in the raid so they can start the quest?  At worst it should be party.  Even then, you have to clear UBRS to finish the attunement anyway.  After Rend it’s a quick jaunt to Drakkisath anyway, and then the whole raid can go click the orb while they’re running in 10 at a time so you save at most 15 minutes.  It might be an issue for bleeding edge guilds trying to nab that precious classic world first.
---

Name change SHOULD bother you.

4:3 screen, Titanpanel getting so much screen space for so little benefit, some auras appear twice in the actionbar, raid frames all over the place...

I'll give you a 9/10.
---
Hearthstone is too far away from bubble.
---
Fat chance.
---
Yeah I’m salty because that’s where I farm dem gold
---
Yeah pretty much. Kinda like how Ragnaros also came back as a boss in Firelands despite also being in Molten Core. 
---
why are you this way
---
That flatscreen monitor though, guess OP is part of the  1%
---
They were pretty explicit with saying 1.10 drops is the only thing they are concerned with. The items you mention will almost certainly be there at launch.
---
Make new friends, some that are taking this adventure for the first time.  They'll need guidance.  Take them to all the places that made you wide eyed and giddy, then enjoy how they react and remember how it was for you.
---
That's Inkarnate is it? I would kill to use the PRO version someday.
---
Yeah. The sub is totally worth it.
---
I just want to be the yang to the ying. People circlejerk a lot around here. I want to point out some flaws, stuff that might want to be fixed and so on.  
---
People don't like changes, but classic was flawed in many ways, and forums from back in the day reflected that very much. 
---
That was an amazing dungeon and such a great way to interact with the lore.  I loved all the CoT dungeons because of the call backs to Warcraft missions
---
&gt;Suppose someone just got very lucky and some gear dropped in a dungeon that was bop mail, but you're a rogue.  You walk away from that dungeon with nothing more than 1 quest completed, and maybe 1-2 gold in trash you can vendor.  
---
&gt;Does that shaman/hunter/warrior owe you time now because they got lucky with their BoP drops?  What if they won some "crappy" (according to you) blues that you didn't care about?  Do you hold that against them now too?
---
Here.
---
And yes my philosophy is that for items worth more than a day's grinding gold is Greed before Need. Regardless if you can use it. Because being able to use it or not becomes irrelevant at that point. In my opinion.
---
Of course, I adapt to the unwritten group rules. So I really hope the shitty philosophy of giving extremely valued purple BoE's to the person who just happened to have the right class will not take hold in classic, because it will open up the road to ninjaism 101 and lots of drama in /general
---
The thing about these dungeons is the more familiar with them that you get the more you understand you only have to do parts. BRD for example, youll most likeyl see people doing Emp runs/Arena Runs/7D runs/Quest runs. With each having a completely different focus on parts of the dungeon. ST is a little less like this but thats because its mainly used as a leveling/questing dungeon during the early 50's compared to BRD which has a lot of prebis gear.
---
Those are the best vanilla memories!
---
Look at the size of that task bar!!
---
Dude.. these maps are SO satisfying for some reason. Keep up the great work, and more please!
---
Didn't mean to come off like an ass but here's my full argument why you've overvalued that specific relic, and most relics fall into the same category while others excel much much more than the rest.
---
You're right in the calcs of sp for LB but an elem shaman is only spamming LB in a few situations, and while you're still correct there, I often chalk up items to the entire range of play, and this for me largely means pvp and wpvp. Even if pve, other than raiding, you've over valued the item and here's why- 
---
Shamans will use LB (we are talking elem spec only for this argument) for probably about 60% or more of their single target damage grinding mobs. In other circumstances, pvp specifically, abilities like frost shock, flame shock vs rogues, searing totem, fire Nova totem, and lightning bolt are going to be the 90% of damage and LB is used as a finisher (typically with an instant chain lightning after). 
---
Then you have the entire need for healing, both oneself and others.
---
At the end of the day, I would wager you could put a +10 spell power (was there this stat back in classic or exclusive damage / healing?) relic and it would be chosen over the "39" spell power to bolt, except for elem raiding.
---
Yeah, I get ya. Looking at my post again too, I worded it horribly; I tend to think of Relics less as a disadvantage pre 1.10/Phase 5, and more of a happy surprise boost just in time for AQ! And for a while, no one will be lacking in high level 5-man runs because all the raiders will flock back to Scholo/Strat/BRD etc more so than usual to pick up whatever their best pre-AQ40/Naxx relics are. Which is nice for the pugs who still need, say, their Ony attunements, or are new/casual and have only just hit those dungeon level ranges.
---
I'm just trying to give you an analogy so you can see my PoV. Yes, I agree, IRL I'm more likely to get a fair share of the proceeds. In WoW? Not so much. Because there's no incentive or consequences for the seller to be fair.
---
Indeed we will, however, only in the event of exceptional value items. If Executioner's Cleaver drops and the warrior needs it? Take it and enjoy it my friend. Kang? Nope.
---
Perhaps they should introduce an escrow feature for dungeon loot. lol
---
Kilrogg EU or NA?
---
RESPECT for playing wow in a suite ;)
---
Dueling its holy pally.  People forget and will soon remember.  Holy paladin is the best dueler 1v1 in the game.  Absolutely no one can beat them.  The issue you don't see any videos of this is because they are fucking boring as shit.  You can't kill them and they will wack you with their 40 dps weapon and it will take 5 minutes.
---
Which is not true, because I very much enjoyed vanilla back in the day. And I'm looking forward to summer as well. Doesn't mean I like everything about it. Game was flawed back then, forums reflected that, as well as the direction they took the game (for the good and the bad).  
---
It's not as black and white as many of you want it to be somehow.
---
&gt;Life is not fair. Deal.
---
This isn't life. It's a video game. Game balancing is both a core design feature and maintenance requirement of every online game. There's a point where you stop playing a game due to unfairness, no? Unfairness isn't fun and game designers know this. This is besides the point, because I never *once* mentioned fairness or used it as my argument.
---
Every single one of you have the exact same defense. *You're just jealous. Life isn't fair, deal with it.* You completely ignore the context and arguments against in favor of your base assumption that we are just jealous.
---
Why not argue against the points I made, instead of the points you created to argue against?

I have no idea why I had it that big :o

Hopefully they do. Many of us are adults now.
---
you literally do have a ton of different paths, keys for shortcuts, jumps to skip mobs, im not sure what youre trying to get at. Vanilla will not hold your hand. get creative :)
---
I'm not worried at all. I will pick from one of the few RPPVE servers. Which ever has the most awkward stupidest name :D
---
IIRC blizzards policy was that if they wanted it for vendor gold they could literally need roll anything. Probably a stance they took to make moderating player interactions easier?
---
I guess all rolling need on edge masters is #changes? Because the majority clearly all rolled need
---
#nochanges is #dead
---
But more to the point. I'll either have to go 3-4 months with no epic mount, or pay 500-600g 3-4 months after having paid 900g.
---
Agreed. I'd kill for an 11 DPS weapon at level 5.
---
I should think more like you!
---
Gaming is usually a silent activity for me, and I never enjoyed having to conference call for raiding, but put up with it as a necessary evil.  
---
Has VR chat managed to do anything good in that space?  Last I heard it was all good fun for memeing with hank hill and Ugandan knuckles avatars, but I really need something of a more developed experience.  
---
Actually, if they popped up your avatars name and face while you were pushing to talk that would go a long way, as well as if they properly filtered things to cut down on bad mics and the like. 
---
I didn't say 1-2g items.  And that was a specific context saying "if you walked away from a dungeon run with only 1-2g in ALL ITEMS worth of value (whites/grays etc) and someone else walked away with a bunch of BoP blues" would you expect them to owe you time since they got lucky with their BoP drops?  
---
It's a completely different scenario, doesn't have ANYTHING to do with BoE blues being valued at 1-2g.
---
And I fail to see how it opens up the road to "ninjaism".  If you are that class, I doubt you'd complain at getting a nice upgrade.  Noone is saying that a level 59 Mage should roll need on staff of jordan (a level 39 boe epic), but if you're between levels 36-40 as a mage, it is an upgrade. 
---
Once again, you're subscribing to the "fear of ninjas" which honestly was not that common of an occurrence.  Once again, the few times a ninja did get the better of you are clouding your memory and judgement over the many more times that rolls were done fairly.
---

---
I don't expect you to "come around" at this point.  I don't expect you to "see the error of your ways" because quite honestly cognitive dissonance has already gotten to the point where you feel completely justified in your actions based on the few negative experiences you had in the past.
---
And like I originally said:  The fear of ninjas is promoting this Prisoner's Dilemma fallacy of need/greed rolling.  It's a vicious cycle.  
---
Anyhow I'm done here.  I'm not going to argue this any further,  you obviously have your own thought process on what is right.  I'm just warning you now, that the "vocal majority" of reddit is a small microcosm compared to the people who will be playing Classic WoW.  You might find yourself in for a rude awakening when you roll need on a boe purple and get kicked from your group or find the "drama you so avidly tried to avoid", still exists regardless of your imaginary ruleset you have.
---
Orc Warlock, Dwarf/UD Spriest, Ud/Gnome Mage, Hemo Rogue with MSA/Tf proc party and engi, a skilled druid.
---
well then, #blizzlike it is boys.
---
Fancy keyboard, wireless mouse, Creative speakers... OP really is:)
---
I think you might be surprised. Most of the people who were playing when vanilla was current will have full time jobs, wives, kids, etc. Sure you have some streamers who are going to play like it's their full time job and that's to be expected, but most of us would be totally fine if the pace of the content was slowed because it will match the change in free time that many of us have gone through.
---
And for those of you who were already working full time during vanilla, I doubt most of you are retired by now! It's going to be a player base that is primarily composed of working age people. I have some doubts that it will resonate with the younger gamers that other games like Minecraft and Fortnite appeal to. It was a very different time in online gaming. 
---
Either way, I'm really excited to relive that magic. Even if it ends up holding only a fraction of the wonder that it had the first time I experienced it, it's going to be great.

As always the best PvP class at every single level is a holy paladin.

I think Macros and Addons will be the simplified retail versions but who knows.
---
I know.  I'm in the same boat.   Currently I plan to get everything banked and the gold set aside, then help my wife farm up her epic mount.  Hopefully by the time we finish her epic mount and pre-farming all my items, the quest will be in game or will be soon thereafter.  If not, I'll start farming for my own non-class epic mount.  Ultimately I want the class one and a regular one anyway if possible :P
---
&gt; Why not argue against the points I made, instead of the points you created to argue against?
---
But you just did a smiliar thing. You picked one sentence out of his paragraph and ignored the rest of his post.
---
R14 does require skill as well. You are competing against your own as well as the opposite faction. It is not as simple as playing long periods of time.
---
Also are you wearing a freakin' suit or sport coat or something??
---
killer mousepad
---
And that's fine because I don't want to play with people who lack simple reasoning skills so all this does is help me better filter out scrubs.
---
The battle for Azeroth wouldn't be so bad if we were actually fighting players for control of zones instead of fighting npcs for control of instanced versions of two zones.
---
Well if you get the class mount first, you can buy a cat, mechanostrider, etc for 90g. It's only the class mounts that are prohibitively expensive unless you get them first.
---
So looks like I'll never have my Charger.
---
Not sure
---
There's significant variance in damage dealt per swing and mob hp, so sometimes having more AP will make the difference between how many swings it takes to kill the mob.
---
Think he means the CoT version from wrath
---
this man is wearing a suit while playing wow
---
Tips comes across as disingenuous. I really can't put my finger on it, just never overly enjoyed him. 
---
There's a far simpler solution which was introduce in patch 4.x.x I think (can't recall specifics).  Need rolls will bind a BoE item to the winner, greed rolls won't.  
---
Yeah that's incredible! Especially for dnd I'm going to pass tbis to my DM maybe he can make some super sweet maps for our sessions.
---
Right, okay thanks, that makes sense now. 
---
SM Cath Mograine can also drop Scarlet Chestpiece also very low drop rate.
---
I did all that in TBC with flying. Flying didn't take away anything personally for me but rather it enhanced it. So not really sure what you're talking about. 
---
It will be slow going, but if you really love dungeons it will be fun.
---
Would like to see more angles of this so i can zoom in 
---
I can confirm you can raid with aoe spec as frost mage. I made almost 700g from diremaul dogs farming after a while. You can get improved blizzard and I believe it's winters chill 5\5 as well which raids want as well. It's not bad for PvP either. I'm pretty sure you still get shatter as well. I really recommend it dude.
---
Hi, /u/Estayy
---
Thwoping peons left and right, wake up you sleepy bastards!
---
And most of the quest mobs there a neutral to alliance members. The rogue ganking and running into the mobs afterwards. Great fun
---
Suit ;)
---
I don't think a little dingy should be faster than a full-blown galleon. If you want them to be safer from pvp threats make them stealthier instead. A big galleon would be visible from quite far away but a tiny rowboat wouldn't be.
---
&gt;&gt; Why not argue against the points I made, instead of the points you created to argue against?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;But you just did a smiliar thing. You picked one sentence out of his paragraph and ignored the rest of his post.
---
Yeah, that's the point.
---
&gt;R14 does require skill as well. You are competing against your own as well as the opposite faction. It is not as simple as playing long periods of time.
---
You're competing against them in a system, not in combat. You compete against them by... playing for long periods of time.
---
You can buy the item with gold.
---
You can sell the item for gold.
---
Therefore it is gold.
---
Hi, /u/muslimthrowawayyy
---
No attunements in DM but there are some good Head/Leg enchants that will be nice to have before ZG comes out and then after ZG comes out you will need to get them and then use them to get the ZG head/leg enchants which are very very good for most classes.
---

---
1) not paladin.
---
2) dwarfs are good, stoneform always comes in handy.
---
3) not sure myself
---
I memorized the spawns of all the Black Lotus.  I'd continually challenge myself to see how many I could farm in a day.  I think my record was 43.  
---
You were playing TBC in 2005? 
---
Assuming this isn't a troll it's Dire Maul. Not dead mines.
---
Items won't be added until they were added in their respective content patch that corresponds to the correct phase, is how I understand it. Stats will not change.
---
What needs to get settled now is how the pvp system is going to be implemented. You have rank 14 gear at 1.4, then later at 1.11(phase 6) you have new rank 14 gear added, as well as a level 60 blue set. So do you allow ex rankers to purchase the new gear retroactively or what? There isn't really a point to farm rank 14 at 1.11 (phase 6) when you can get better weapons than the rank 14 gear in naxx/aq40.
---
ST is fun with a good group, but it can be a nightmare/huge time suck with a below average group. especially if the average level is lower then say 52. Dragon's Call (rare epic sword from Eranikus) is one of the more fun Weapons in the game too IMO (calls a dragon whelp to come fight with you)
---
This is who I always pictured playing behind a NE Hunter running through Ashenvale, right before I opened with cheap shot :)
---
Polymorph —&gt; Pyro —&gt; Pom —&gt; Pyro? 
---
I personally don’t care for Naxx patch forever servers.  I would love to see more content maybe in groups of 3 so ‘phase 7 + 8 + 9’.  Maybe release it a year after Naxx is out.  
---
1.  Attacking on Paladin is going to be auto driven, no way around it.
---
2. Dwarves are fine, but Humans have better racials overall when it comes to Paladin.
---
3. No more tthan any other class with reagents.
---
There's a difference between something being known and something being known by absolutely everyone. It will 100% be a problem this time around. Thats why most private servers nerf it.
---
Your STV map is my wallpaper, keep them coming!!! You da bomb
---
"No son of mine is opening Christmas presents in his pajamas like some commoner!"
---
Yeah but farming and getting hold on to some item that is trash just because you know it will get buffed in few months is weird. Personally I like the semi-progressive itemization they chose. Really happy with Blizz' decision here.
---
Not sure if this makes me more nostalgic for XP or WoW!
---
Classic isn't Vanilla. Rogues and Mages were broken in 1.1. Classic is 1.13. Lots of spec and race combinations can beat rogue, but rogues are still awesome in WPVP. You can take a pretty bad player on a Shadow Priest and beat the best rogue in the world if you get a blackout proc. If you are undead and they aren't dwarf you could spin around in circles and win. 
---
Balance is simply bad, just like the modern game before consumables, trinkets, engineering. With all those things usually the best player can win or has a good shot to win. I would argue vanilla has far better 1 v 1 balance than the modern game when you use everything at your disposal.
---
Duels basically mean jack sh@% in vanilla unless you are using everything or at least allowing trinkets and engineering. A lot of times you pick a race to counter a certain group of players. Say dwarf to counter rogue blind or undead shadow priest dots. Against some classes Gnome is superior if we are doing no consumable, trinket, engineering duels. these are the kind of choices that give Vanilla flavor. 
---
Now if you want to to know what beats most people in meaningless fights where You are using 6-7 less keybinds? SL Lock, Hunter, Rogue, Mage, S Priests probably beat the most things, but some classes have super hard counters. Example a Ret Paladin should never lose to a rogue in a duel. Rets also have a whole nother life long cooldown that people don't usually allow in duels but if they use it they can beat a lot of classes. Rets also are stupidly stronger with engineering and all it offters than without it and people have lots of stupid duel rules. If there is any line of site there druid gets bumped way up and druids are also incredible out in the world because there is no "out of ring" penalty. Shamans are incredible in BG's. 
---
Rogue, Mage and Ret Paladin are nothing alike though. Rogue is a zen like class where if you spam buttons you are garbage because energy matters so much. They are nothing like modern WoW rogues. Mage is a pressure class/twitchy class. When you are rolling and making  people react to you,  you are unstoppable. Ret is a class that is simply designed for new players. You have multiple seconds sitting there doing nothing. Some people want that and I think every game needs specs like that. Don't confuse them with Rogue or Mage though. I don't know one good mage or rogue who ever was happy playing a ret. They think the spec is a joke.
---
I’ve been considering it.  Not really sure it’s going to be worth the trouble.
---
1. consecration from the holy tree and the rest into protection to make you tankier for aoe lvling.
---
2. Dwarf is overall better, human if you care about the \~3% hit chance with swords/maces
---
3. Pally can aoe farm DM lashers I think, other than that I haven't heard of them standing out in money making besides maybe charging for tanking services in 5 man dungeons.
---
Lol I remember a duel between two resto druids lasting at least 30 minutes. Incredibly boring
---
It's actually blizzards policy, and I've been subject to a few of those in overwatch and had no issue overturning by submitting a ticket. It helps that I didn't just talked trash back at the guys
---
Holy Paladin with SoC. My man! High Five.
---
Blizz generally releases on Tuesdays so..... 
---
 /u/Ionic_Pancakes  /u/Nudvik This guys comment is rude.  However you kind of do need to be dominant to be a tank.  And if someone in your group is acting up you NEED to kick them.  If for some reason the other people in the group are making fun of you or criticizing you it increases the chance they will leave mid run or just taunt the boss of you and wipe the run for fun.  You underestimate the horrible people that play this game.  Its better to be dominant and tell them its your way or the highway.  Its better that way and the standard needs to be set.  This is usually set by the tank but personally I have seen combos of tank/healers where the healer is the alpha but is 100% behind the tank.  Someone needs to be the alpha or there is chaos.  This is a good lesson to learn if you want to be the tank.  
---
\-You need to have more information than your group so you can lead.  If you don't than you can consider yourself gathering information.  If people give you information but can't give you a good reason why than you can dismiss this information.  Such as "You need full plate gear to tank RFD".  If they won't let it go - basically if they can't let something go no matter what it is say firmly "Let it go or get kicked you are replaceable" and if they don't let it go kick them.
---
\-even if you are wrong you need to assert dominance and if they question you, you need to kick them and than bully them into submission until the whole guild makes fun of them.  Don't kick them out of the guild let them leave in shame on their own.
---
There wasn’t a “spellpower” stat back in vanilla, it was + spell damage or + healing. Moreover your point is moot, there is no generic stats on the vanilla relics, they’re all spell specific, so your +10 spellpower totem doesn’t exist. I looked it up earlier when I was shown to be misinformed on Shaman relics, you have the option as Ele between “Increases LB + CL damage by up to 33” or “Increases Shock damage by up to 30” for damage relics. That’s it.
---
So no, they’re not undervaluing that specific relic at all. It’s a big chunk of power for both PvE and PvP.
---
"some" dungeons "20+ times" is optimistic. I think you're really underestimating how bad dungeon XP was in vanilla outside of the quests. 
---
Thinking of rolling a healer for classic. It'll be the first time I raid heal. This UI is giving me second thoughts...
---
People are really hung up on the demon thing, wow
---
What brilliant map design, man
---
This is actually a 19 twink dwarf hunter :P
---
Agreed!
---
What's your reasoning behind no humans? Mine is the escapist element. I have to be a human IRL 24/7 already, why the hell would I want to play one in a fantasy game?
---
Same with any other fantasy/sci fi game. Khajiit all the way!
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_of_Atal%27Hakkar_(original)
---
If Dungoens got reworked make sure they are listed at "original" when looking for them.
---
When looking up quests, https://classicdb.ch/ is pretty good since it has the old wowhead comments and all the quests, even the ones that got deleted from wowhead by now.
---
You're right, it's not black and white, which is an odd thing coming from you after all you're posts demonstrating how you clearly don't get the upsides of the vanilla style of design, which leaves me wondering what the hell your point even is?
---
I know there is no 10 spell power relic, I was saying hypothetically, +10 spell power to damage and healing would very likely out class a 39 spell power to lightning bolt alone. That makes a pretty big statement about that relic imo. Again, repeating my last comment about pvp, 39 sp to lb is just "meh" but an awesome upgrade for what was a nonexistent slot before.
---
1. A different class
---
2. Dorfs are always best, ignore minmaxers
---
3. Higher repair on plate, some reagent costs, but nothing extraordinary 
---
NO CHANGES
---
Because of NoChanges classic economy will be worse (meaning higher inflation) than  private servers which had to implement deliberately unblizzlike fixes to prevent  or significantly nerf overpowered gold farming methods.
---
Yeah try hundreds lol 
---
Level 19 with glowy weapons and engineering goggles? Let them run on by. I’ll get the next one :)
---
Ive been doing dungeons as much as possible on pservers. Its slow, but this is the way i like to play. Saving up rested exp really makes it go faster.
---
Personally, the three mounts I'd prefer for my epic mount are the AV ram, the pally class mount, and the zg tiger...so I'm kinda fucked any which way around it lol.
---
My wife's crazy enough that I think she's actually going to farm the winterspring saber...so we may be on slow mounts for a while.
---
can rogues farm gold, pvp, pve with the same spec?
---
For some reason I always thought the fields and bandits were to the North. I never really thought about it until now, but it's East. Wow.
---
I get anxiety just looking at it.
---
I believe the farm place is actually friendly.
---
I don't think there is need to prove you wrong because you are absolutely right.
---
Ticket response times can be anything from hours to days. It is _not_ acceptable to be silenced or even banned entirely as "guilty until proven innocent" during that time. 
---
And for what, the reporters get a 3 hour ban that expires overnight while they are a sleep?
---
They got bigger but some how hit weaker lol
---
As I said to each their own. One of the major problems or issues I see with there being no X realm bg's. Is that you will run into the same people so much it will be demoralizing. The positive note to the familiarity is that you know the people attacking you. The negavtive side to that though. Is after you wait a half hour to finally get into the bg and you got ole big Sal waiting for you. The very same big sal that kicked your ass 14 times already. 
---
You said you spend most of your time preparing for it. This is a rather large request, but would you mind sharing how you are preparing for it? I am considering doing the same. Heck, if you wanna build a PDF of it, I'd read it!
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=10328

Not only am I referencing this but I remember running it multiple times.  
---
Here's Mograines drop table: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?npc=3976#drop
---
Sorry but he didnt drop the chest.  None of the bosses did.  It specifically only dropped from scarlet champions.
---
The item you're thinking of is the Scarlet Leggings which dropped from both Herod and Mograine.
---
I'm very happy to have an irl friend who played back in Wrath to share this excitement with.  
---
But to you OP, I care.
---
Then let's upvote the hell out of this, ***or post it on the Blizzard forums*** (I can't do that myself apparently).
---
Run the mage out of mana engineering is key here
---
yes i suppose you can deliberately, create a char with your current name of a server and force the tranfer to change name.
---
Polymorph—&gt; drink 
---
There's a pretty night and day difference between a rogue and a cat druid with similar gear at 60, so this post is spot on. Reason I say this is that a lot of druids get married to tunnel vision cat form which is simply crazy given your hybrid abilities. Those that can use ALL of their abilities don't get limited to the "druid can only do 80% as well as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (other class)".
---
Also would like to add that learning to kite on a druid is also underrated since you can effectively DoT the shit out of people and reset the fight.  I've never tried balance in vanilla so I'm planning on doing that LAST after I get some gear to try it out. I think the spec was something like 29/11/11. But I think to start I'll either go HOTW or the spec you mentioned. Love your post
---
this UI is pretty over complicated IMO. Luna unit frames/decursive can get you by fine.
---
What about the resource issue for low-pops where high-pop comes into the server and takes the local resources to be distributed to their own local market? Is this going to be a concern? I don't remember the proper term of how the players from other servers came over, but it was an issue in the past, on Live. 
---
Probably not, but that would be cool to see even if it's for more gold 
---
You're right its the legs
---
Figured I’d take a look on my trial account, because I can’t remember all the features like name lighting up when talking etc. 
---
But it seems to be disabled for trial/starter accounts, sorry!
---
But as I remember it your character’s name will pop up on the left side of the screen with a microphone-icon attached when talking. And whenever someone in your party uses the in-game voice chat, an icon left to your chat-window will blink and ask if you want to mute etc.
---
Personally I found it helpful when dealing with new content alongside random players, as a tank I could easier say «interrupt birds, they aoe fear» mid-fight instead of typing while trying to keep aggro.
---
The quality was fine when those talking used a mic, that said... it was pretty bad when they didn’t unfortunately.
---
Stop with the fake concern for how other people spend their time. Its obvious that you want the gear but don't want to put in the work to get it.
---
Humans have nothing that benefits paladins. Unless you are going to be a lolret.
---
Polymorph gets shorter and shorter each time.  It won't work.  Fire spec just isn't going to cut it I'd shred you.  I have fire resist gear on me probably because your need it to raid gg.  Now frost spec is a good duel but I can probably win that too with a good use or cleanse.
---
This is what peak performance looks like. 
---
This is just what you can expect on day 1.
---
I understand that he had to try and drag more than two words out of his guest with easy to answer questions. Monkey was a snoozefest.
---
I get you and I do think it’s important to have both parties represented. The only part I reacted to was the nostalgia argument. I love a good discussion but whether or not the opinions presented are based on nostalgia is in my opinion irrelevant :)
---
We used it quite a few times to bring new members, alts, or people paying for gear drops.. it's quite useful.  
---
Loot trading is shit and shouldn't be in classic. If it is in come release Blizz will not be getting any of my (or any of my friends) money.
---
 I can and will continue playing on Pservers that will be made better with classic release. Hit em where it hurts the old walletpocket.
---
Of course actiblizzon with stagger the content more 'cuse it keeps sub numbers up longer and its arguably better for the game. Loot trading effects them they other way. They feel it will cost them money to oat GMs. OP said it right, no loot trading and no GM tickets to swap loot allowed. Master looter has to pay attention. 
---
IMO it could be as simple as a loading screen tip:
---
&gt; *Unless Master Looter is active, all loot is final.  Be careful!"*
---
This would remove trading from 5/10 mans while still allowing for organized guild runs to fix the odd mistake here and there without need for GM tickets.
---
China will farm anything because the farmers are basically dumb employees that memorize their routines and don’t stray from them
---
I camped a mage farmer as rogue in swamp of sorrows for over an hour and a half and he just kept coming. And coming. And coming. And coming
---
You really can’t base usefulness on whether chinas doing it
---
Plus, 10k+ online servers are a completely different beast than normal ones. They will understandably push almost everyone toward instancing because open world is nuts 
---
Thanks my dude
---
I don't get why people don't use it.  It's a really easy and simple way to talk to people in your guild, social groups, party, raid, ect.. Extremely useful for pugging M+ but it's pretty rare to get more than 2 or 3 people on it.  It's literally one press of the button and you're in which is way easier than discord.  I don't get why we don't use it.
---
I'm so down for this though. Maybe a new server that will have BC launch, and you can choose to transfer your classic character over?
---
When do you think they’ll give w date for phase 1?
---
Whatever you feel like inserting in yourself my man!!
---
20+ isn't that bad of an estimate. Let's look at The Deadmines for example. Start running at 18, and leave once you ding 24 to start doing The Stockade.
---
|Level|XP Per Run|Runs until Ding|
---
--:|--:|--:|
---
|18|11651|1.5|
---
|19|11092|1.7|
---
|20|10651|2.0|
---
|21|9761|2.3|
---
|22|9273|2.6|
---
|23|8809|2.9​|
---
That's 13 runs in total from 18-24. At a quick pace of 1 hour per run, that's 13 hours from 18-24, where 8-9 is a fairly normal pace. That is if you can sustain 1 run an hour with no downtime. 1 hour running it and then 10 minutes getting a group together between runs, it's now a 15 hour 18-24 bracket.
---
So 1.5x to 2x slower as an estimate. Worse for the more out of the way dungeons, since grouping up to start will take up a bit of time.
---
Stocks will take 20+ runs though (23.75,) to get from 25-30.
---
So yeah, pretty bad.
---
This is quality content!
---
Agreed, if you're really intent on doing it this way, it might freshen things up a bit to level 2 or even 3 characters simultaneously.  1 tank, 1 healer, 1 DPS.  Rotate through them so as to stay on rested XP.
---
It would obviously take longer, but might make the mind-numbing repetition a bit more tolerable.  And the time to 60 for each character would be a bit lower, even if they got there later in real-world time.
---
And it happened quicker than people think
---
People like to say it hit at cata or mop. It happened in fucking tbc. 
---
Flying, shammy/pallies added to both sides. normalizing specs because god forbid you have one strong spec. 
---
Balancing stats because god forbid some specs be strong pve and some be strong pvp
---
TBC was the beginning of them flattening EVERYTHING out such that everyone had similar dps, ttk, etc. 
---
They didn’t realize the imbalance and uniqueness of every class/talent tree in vanilla is WHY it rocked
---
This is getting out of hand! Now, there are two of them!
---
i would assume those are Limited invulnerability potions as 3k health is pretty low for a feral druid even out of bear form but i also dont have any idea what wep that is so IDK. 
---
This right here is the true cost of the LFG tool.
---
When your content becomes centered around grouping randoms together, you:
---
1) Have to lower the difficulty so that strangers can complete it
---
2) Streamline the grouped encounters to be a similar length that groups don't auto-drop out of the long ones
---
&gt; Resulting in a lot of people in different stages of the quest. 
---
But why drop out in the middle of a run and miss all of the gameplay and loot?
---
no addons at all is so hard mode its insane. i love it.
---
It is rare for something to just be 'that' simple, but believe it or not. Loot being final **is** the solution to it.
---
It changes nothing and only requires the ML to pay some attention, if they seriously want to fundamentally change the games social aspect because of lazy ML's, we are basically back at square 1 with the issues.
---
Do not implement loot trading!!!!!!
---
Yeah maps where North is up really throws me off
---
druid healing in 5 mans is the essence of vanilla WoW. only 1 rez every 30 min. sub par group heals. ultimate fun.
---
Hunter, I finished retail with 3/8 cryptstalker and kt xbow and felt like a god in bgs and world pvp. 
---
My main goal in classic is to get that xbow again.
---
Replace healing with first aid and don’t get abilities you don’t need!!
---
Here is a rough idea and I may make a video showing it. 
---
Earthbind, searing, mana spring(if you can fight 2 mobs by totems), lightening shield, bandage if need
---
Pull mob with Lbolt, flame shock, melee
---
You can add Lbolts if you are good on mana. Never use C Lightning unless elemental mastery. Use Earth shock or Frost shock to burn clear casting.
---
Who hurt you as a child?
---
You have to opt in to the party voice chat everytime you join a new party.  You don't just get randomly put in the voice chat.  You press (default) "T" then click on the headset icon to join the voice chat.  You are not subjected to it unless you opt in.
---
I think it was called the Culling of Stratholme... been a long time, though
---
He have ambitions a big one as well.  To the author love to join you bro but i already have mate reserved.
---
I am 28 EU guy as well and plan to do exactly as the author maybe 15h instead of 18 cos i love my sleep!
---
Also I EB kite every mob and use a slow staff.
---
Just this weekend I was invitee in a low level pvp ganking party of 2 feral druids and 2 rogues. And we proceeded to make levelling in stonetalon mountains IMPOSSIBLE for horde. 
---
Most fun I had playing this game in a long time.
---
I also recall fond memories of my buddy and I staying up until 3 am even tho I had school in the morning. Just doing long ass quest chains in silithus, pvp and whatnot.
---
This is the best game ever made by mankind
---
I love running dungeons but can't imagine leveling this way in vanilla. There just aren't enough dungeons and players are so spread out throughout the world that it takes forever waiting for a new group to form and arrive.
---
On a TBC private server I leveled a resto shaman from 60 to 70 exclusively through dungeons and it worked reasonably well because there is a new dungeon every level and travel time for players coming to the dungeons is short due to how condensed outland is, but vanilla is a whole different animal.
---
&gt;Using 3rd party software is much better IMO.
---
why?  Just curious.  As someone who uses party/guild/social group voice chat regularly.. and I also use discord when I have to.  I find the in game chat far more convenient.
---
True, but IIRC when you are in the game zone, it is called northshire abbey the whole way through it. I've been wrong before though, and it will definitely happen again
---
Loot trading should only exist for master looter. This allows the most important loot (guilds in raids) to be traded in case of missclicks and other arrangements, but won't allow just any group of friends to steal loot in 5-mans.
---
why didnt you just upload the image¿
---
seems very unecessary to first print it out, then make a photo, and then upload it .. i mean why? 
---
Except that it DOES change something. Loot wasn't final in vanilla.
---
Also shadow meld mind controlling people off the lumber mill in AB is priceless. 
---
Because giving randoms access to voice chat can easily lead to toxicity and unwanted behaviour. Discord/teamspeak etc are all invite only and are generally used by friends/guilds. 
---
its way more then gold.
---
if you never have the amount of gold that this item goes for on the AH then a drop in invaluable for you.
---
if you don't ever plan to pay the amount the item goes for, even if you had it, then a drop is invaluable for you.
---
unlike other upgrades which you can replace by raiding this item is BiS for [almost] the entire game making it more then just gold.
---
if you are a warrior and really want this item, then anyone who steals this from you is essentially fucking you over for the amount it costs to buy this from the AH.  
---
its not losing a fuck ton of cash vs selling your firstborn.  
---
just so you can get a free mount?  
---
idk, that sounds very greedy and selfish to me.
---
I don’t expect this at all. They (blizzard) addressed this “issue” not having a good “fix” for the starting zone “issues” meaning they do not want a mob starved zone where original progression is heavily delayed and not aligned with the original experience. They can use sharding for starting zones or tweak mob spawns so that they spawn every half second.
---
You are grouped with these people you're talking to.  I don't understand your point, the people you're talking to are the same people you're playing with who would be on discord anyways.  You have to opt-in to chat with them either way.  If someone is being toxic they would be on discord too.  You can mute them just as easy in game and never group with them again if you want..  
---
I don't get your point because you'd be talking to the same people in game chat vs discord.
---
Do you think it'd be best to just stick with that? Do you think they shouldn't add any new content and just keep looping through vanilla?
---
I don't think I've ever been to that waterfall in the north.  Anything special there?
---
The hunter pvp gloves are bis until illidan raid in TBC.
---
the additional debuffs slots at the beginning of the server will also make MC easier from the start. And ony Phase 2....MORE DOTS!!!
---
&gt; You're competing against them in a system, not in combat. You compete against them by... playing for long periods of time. 
---
They are competing in a system which requires combat by playing for long periods of time....and doing better than other groups.
---
&gt;Look at HWL in classic; they keyboard turned and clicked.
---
Many people in vanilla keyboard turned and clicked.
---
Or, for a class that grinds slowly, you want a 10% faster rep grind for every faction. That can add up to a lot of saved time on a character that doesn't exactly kill or grind fast(solo anyway). Also a plus to hit with swords/maces for solo grinding, and more spirit (only helps with pve questing on a pally outside dungeons but still). Compared to gun skill, which you can't use, stone form which is cool but your a pally (easy to cleanse or bubble stuff away). For a pve pally, I'd think human is the clear choice with pvp being a tossup. 
---
I think this is the best alternative. Blizzard doesn’t want the work of loot tickets.
---
10 and above pug are usually run with a masterlooter to ensure the people that are rolling roll for something usefull for their mainspec. Loot trading is still a problem here.
---
disclaimer: I love seeing these, it's a nice change in pace from the usual crying on this subreddit about random things.
---
But isnt the cave in the middle of the top, not the top right?
---
Either way, love your work dude and really enjoy seeing it =)
---
Love the art style man, looks dope
---
Id be the warrior, and id lose the roll to a hunter or shaman with chinese dice.  Everybody else in the party but me would type 'gz' in party chat.
---
I would die a little inside and return to tanking in arms/fury spec because anytime I dps dungeons I get Sir Chromosomesalot tanking that cant hold aggro on adds off the healer.
---
Then after I kick said greedy hunter/shaman out of spite, we get a new dps to the dungeon:  arms/fury warr.
---
Fuck
---
My
---
Life
---
You also needed a beast of a PC. 
---
Ahh that explains it! During the BfA beta when I tested it, all party members were automatically opted in to the voice chat.
---
&gt;\[...\] but won't allow just any group of friends to steal loot in 5-mans.
---
It will, though. The only kind of loot people address here are BoPs. 
---
People can still steal cloth drops, lockboxes, BoEs, reagents, etc. Those need to be made BoP on top of loot being final in order to prevent a group of friends from stealing loot. 
---
Ragnaros was in on release, you can see this by him receiving changes in patches 1.3 and 1.4 - https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Ragnaros_(tactics)
---
I not sure where this idea that Ragnaros wasn't added until 1.4 came from but I've seen it a lot over the past few days. 
---
Man I definitely remember spending hours trying to climb near vertical mountains and cliffs. Just goofing off with friends trying to explore the map for no other reason than it was fun.
---
Then it falls to the players to only join pug groups with Master Looters they believe to be trustworthy.  But then, that was kinda always the case, wasn't it?
---
&gt;What fight has fears that is tauntable?
---
Magmadar, I'm pretty sure Vem, and *maybe* Gluth, IIRC.    
---
Hunters are way better than lock dps, never lost to a warlock in retail vanilla. And as far as naxx I got #4 in dps on four horsemen, I can link video. Only private server kids think hunter raid dps is bad
---
I never pay attention to anything except name &amp; race. Whether or not they have facial hair, what color hair, skin color or the shape of their nose does not concern me. Other aspects such as race or name changes (or realm changes) are bad for the community.
---
Won’t happen
---
It helps them save money
---
Stop beating the dead horse 
---
People can argue ethics and internet assholes all they want but this was/is the rule of thumb.
---
No doubt, there should be no loot trading at all in the game. Yes, throughout many hours of raiding some misloots or mistakes may happen - it's human error after all. But it is better for the health of the game and community that those mistakes are permanent rather than allowing loot trading and all its negative aspects.
---
Now it would be preferable in case of a 40 man raid scenario where a blatant mistake happens that it could be reversible via GM help, but if the scenario is that there will be no actual GM interference in loot matters then the clearly preferable alternative is to have NO Loot Trading.
---
In the last month or so me and my guild/friends are all moving over to blizzard voice chat.  The way the groups and everything works is just like discord and it works through the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client even when you're not in game too so there's no worries there if you need to change characters or anything it can work just like discord with the added advantages of knowing exactly who's talking (character name isn't always the name in discord) and being able to join the chat right in game for pugs.
---
You are right!  Totally forgot about them.  they were druids only way of shedding healing aggro lol
---
The layout is incredibly monotonous, though. Dungeons should be a break in the repetitive nature of questing and grinding, not more of it. ST is unique, but it's really just 3 circular areas of clearing mobs and a one-trick pony of a puzzle. It doesn't have a lot of replay value compared to other dungeons because of its design. That's just my opinion.
---
Don't play on a PvP server?
---
Trading things that aren't soulbound is not the kind of "loot trading" this thread is about.
---
Ofc they will, because you'll wake up from your dream and realise it's just a faster way to deal with problems that existed and got solved by GMs in vanilla.
---
I say it wrong on purpose
---
The launch of classic will not be a success in my book unless I see a picture posted of this man wearing an identical suit in front of the iconic loading screen we all know and love the very same day of the release!
---
Did anyone ever contact you? I'm looking for a Horde PvE server group as well, but haven't found one yet. 
---
Great update.  This is pretty much exactly the staggering I was hoping for.
---
This was very informative, I appreciate you taking the time to write this! 
---
I wouldn't consider something you have to open a ticket for and have a GM manually change as part of the actual gameplay. Loot was final by design.
---
I think this is one of those issues where we kind of have to accept that it will not be vanilla-like, no matter the way it goes.  Blizzard's model as a company has changed greatly since 2004 (most of it not positive, by the way), and having a flood of GMs available to handle such requests is simply not something they will do for us.  
---
Since there's no hope of getting that to happen, we have to settle for other options.  The solution seems simple from there - once you have a BOP in your hands, the only other hands it should ever touch is a vendor's.  No tickets, no GM pleas, just deal with it and select your ML's carefully.
---
Also make sure your ML's aren't LUI (looting under the influence of drugs/alcohol).   :)
---
i posted these more for the "No changes whatsoever" audience. since this is what it will end up with if there are no changes.  i do want sharding for the level 1 - 5 areas otherwise you will have instances like this where there are 25 - 100 people standing around a mob trying to be the first one to tag it.
---
So, how it’s supposed to be pronounced?
---
It also doesn't indicate progressive spells/talents :(
---
I think blizzard wont budge on this. Not having loot trading is specifically to avoid having GM tickets about the wrong person picking up an item.  If they insist, they should only allow it in raids and for 5 minutes. That's it. It gives enough time to trade, and no need for a GM. Do not allow in dungeons. Do not allow in the world.
---
Such a non factor issue being blown entirely out of proportion. 
---
True true, my bad tbh.
---
I still use it nowadays :(
---

---
&gt; if you don't ever plan to pay the amount the item goes for, even if you had it, then a drop is invaluable for you.
---
If you equip the item then you lose the amount of gold it would have sold on ah. Losing 1000g potential gold from equipping = literally the same as losing 1000 actual gold.
---
Guilds prefer more stable independent voip programs because WoW voip has a bad reputation, I don't know how it is nowadays but back in Wotlk/Cata it was horrible. Especially when a whole guild entered and started talking. 
---
Not to mention that it could make WoW lag out or make WoW use a more heavy load to run. It's better to just use Discord for example, an independent program that uses less of a load where you can have ranks for your entire community, it will stay up if WoW randomly crashes for someone or in a whole, post pictures, change servers if people starts lagging, etc etc. It's just better.
---
You'll learn one day.
---
Youre clearly taking this data from pservers which are unreliable. 
---
Logitech. I used to rock them as well
---
You probably shouldn't comment if you don't get my points though. I just leave my opinion here and there, and try to be an advocate for sensible changes.
---
IMO vanilla could've been better, it's sad to see history repeat itself, thats all.
---
It's not cause of lazy, it's cause mistakes happen.  Blizzard during vanilla was smart enough to understand every other MMO in the market was being needlessly bad by not allowing loot restorations and trades.  Vanilla WoW was founded on the concept of NOT being the kind of game that would punish you for a mistake and it was better for it.
---
Bring on loot trading, it will keep people playing this game longer because there will be one less thing to be frustrated about when an honest mistake happens.
---
You clicker!
---
Cheers!
---
Look, you gotta think for a moment here: Do you realize how INSANE it is to spend 12-16 hours on wow, every single f\*\*\*ing day for months, not knowing if you will even get to R14, because that depends of how much sleep your competition sacrificed, how your team holds up, and some random algorithm shit to boot?  
---
Now please notice how many new people keep saying "yeah R14 would be nice can I have that plx". Put those two together, and what do you see m8? Those plebs are red and blue from envy, it's oozing out of them.   
---
Nobody's denying you or anyone else lvl60 or full epics (with appropriate time and care invested, of cause). R14 is not for everybody, it's for an insane minority, and it is not game breaking that a few people have insane gear.
---
Except it was part of the normal game play cause everyone did it SO much they implemented it directly into the game.
---
Your best bet is probably to download the 1.12 and log into a private server.
---
Paladins can do fine even if they use just the default raid frames. I actually prefer that to decursive because it keeps you on your toes when it comes to manually deciding decurse priority.
---
This would be great.  I know what I want all my character names to be, and the very first thing I'm going to do is grab them, so it would be nice to already have the looks squared away too!
---
Oh look it's you again. People had like 1-2 locks per raid in vanilla and no shadowweaving, hence shit dps. Don't even think most ran the sac pet spec either in vanilla. The only unknown factor that would reduce lock dps on private servers is shadow resistance on bosses which is just a made up value. And the only thing that is incorrect and would increase hunter dps is boss armor values, even if most speculate it is actually lower on private servers so hunters would do even less dmg with proper values.
---
And you're citing like literally the most perfect hunter fight in the game and one of the worst caster bosses in the game. Tons of moving around. U're gonna brag about shazzrah next or something? Just go away dude. Hunters fall off because they don't get any weapon upgrades between BWL and the entirety of naxx among other things. Their T2 armor is BIS for like Forever too iirc.
---
In other words, you’re hoping that Classic will come with integrated voice chat like it is on retail? Happy to see some diversity among the comments, most seemed to not care one bit!
---
Well I get your point about having a bad reputation.  It's pretty stable now.  
---
The chat is run through the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client so even if wow crashes you stay in the voice chat.  It's run on a separate program with essentially an in-game app and configuration for it.  You can add ranks and roles to you guild or group chats too which come with voice.  You can setup the community groups for cross server just like discord and send pictures and everything using the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client.  Literally has the same functionality but with in-game support.
---
How is he faking certain abilities?
---
I actually never went to Northshire during vanilla, being a night elf, but I can imagine you feel with Elwynn Forest as I do with Teldrassil.
---
Everyone says loot is final until it's them who needs the loot trade for a legitimate reason.  It's good for the community to have this, and WoW was originally founded on offering services like this to the player.
---
I would rather my friends not quit in frustration, bring on loot trading, it's the only viable alternative in 2019.
---
Sorry...loot trading part is at 39:30
---
He says it's def going to be in Classic.  I doubt they're going to remove it because you think it's bad.  Just listen to his reasoning.  They're not getting rid of it.  Sorry you have to cry so much about it.
---
This happens with new xpacs where you have to talk to one npc to start the quest. I’m ok with it. /tar npc name.
---
It doesn't actually matter if it comes with in game support because it can all be run through the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client.  My guess is there will be in game support but it will just be me sitting in chat in pugs.. lol.
---
Have no idea how to do that.. But thanks anyway!!
---
Pretty sure it was the **vast** majority before WotLK that sent a ticket in, and even then the feature was added in WotLK I think.
---
I never did it, nor know of anyone else who did. I played the duration of Vanilla.
---
I agree with all of these except for hair style/color. I don't think there's any good reason why there shouldn't be a barbershop where you can pay in-game gold to change hair style and color *only*, **except** that it isn't blizzlike. Dying your hair and/or getting a new hairstyle are things that anyone can realistically do in real life so it shouldn't break immersion like changing skin color/race does, nor does it give toxic members of the community a way to escape their reputation without also being able to name/realm change.
---
That being said I'm not advocating for barbershops in Classic because they are not needed at all. I just think the idea that no one being able to change their hairstyle is somehow beneficial to community health is ridiculous. But at the same time, the only downside to not having it for me personally is that I need to be careful to make sure I choose hairstyles that produce the least gear clipping (because that shit bothers me so much :P) 
---
I will deliver!
---
That doesn't help if other people counter the rogues
---
They’d be official mad lads
---
I'm not even sure what to do with all the space on a 38" ultrawide.
---
Clegane?
---
Don’t care. That’s years away.
---
Who are these careless players who were constantly opening up loot tickets? In all my time playing vanilla I never opened up a ticket for a loot mistake, and I can only think of a single time where we had a loot mix up in our guild that we opened a ticket for (and I'm not sure if the GM even fixed it). Be careful when you loot or assign loot, it's not that hard.
---
Well it might have gotten better then I honestly don't know since I haven't even considered using it since Cata, but I think it's too late to introduce now since people are already used to using other programs for voip.
---
Sorta depends on if you want to be flashy, solo or with group, or if you want to outlast people. Mage hbit +warrior, ele shaman are all super flashy big number machines if your wanting to do montage videos that's the way to go
---
If you don't care about being flashy sl lock has consistently good matchups in 1v1 but its mostly just because of how hard they are to kill, they are kinda bad in premades though.
---
If you play with a group, warrior, they are wrecking balls with support.
---
If you want to show everybody how leet your skillz are go rogue and outplay every class once every 10 mins
---
Yeah same here. I dont remember the appearance options.. And you cant change them once chosen. 
---
There will be no GM tickets in Classic. So it won't be 100% Vanilla no matter what we say. But at least we can prevent a catastrophe to happen because of loot trading. If we do a mistake it's on us. Sad but the best of the worst.
---
Well, I actually remember i had a few keybinds. Q for arcane shot. F for concussive shot. E for Serpent Sting. The rest I clicked. :P
---
Both loot being final without any GM tickets to help and the loot trading mechanics are changes. 
---
No changes would be GMs handling loot errors, but that seems to be off the table for some reasons.
---
So it's about which one of the two changes is the better choice. 
---
Personally I don't really care for loot trading, I'll play Classic either way with or without loot trading. 
---
But what I'll say is the abuse/ninjaing paranoia is blown way out of proportion. I'm not saying it won't happen, but if it does happen it's going to happen on such a miniscule scale it just doesn't matter in the big picture. Loot trading abusers can easily be recognized and called out for their behaviour and subsequently get blacklisted, it's simple as that, just like "normal" ninjas. And since your reputation matters and in fact the vast majority of the WoW community are not total dicks, it will remain an absolute rarity. 
---
Actually it might do the exact opposite of what you think it would, since getting ninja'd creates a story.
---
Getting your item instantly doesn't, and mind you. You will have a much harder time getting a item if you are playing solo as people will group up on you to trade the item between themselfs.
---
And if you somehow manage to give the wrong person loot, maybe dont be the ML and actually look at what you are doing
---
No. Not having any GM tickets allowed for loot does save them exactly the same money. We just don't want any other way of recovering mistaken loots.
---
There are actually some programs that let you make cool maps super easy.
---
Old style of game mastering is long gone. WoW no longer has a dedicated GM team. Gamemasters deal with every Blizzard game these days nost just WoW and to reduce the workload (or simply cut costs) they have automated pretty much everything that can be automated.
---
I don't believe that they are willing to change that for one game. But it is okay to try so keep the comments coming if you feel like loot trading is bad.
---
 Not having loot trading is specifically to avoid having GM tickets about the wrong person picking up an item 
---
That's why we specifically say all the time that we don't want GM tickets either. Just none of those things. It will save money to Blizzard the exact same way.
---
Client here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TDoNNUXCtsgIUhLw96biPCqjv3AcLYkg/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TDoNNUXCtsgIUhLw96biPCqjv3AcLYkg/view) 
---
Create an account on Elysium or Light's Hope or whatever and edit the realmlist file, super easy! 
---
... Just try not to get tempted to play and end up leveling on one of these servers until Classic hits...
---
If you had a look at the other threads I link, that have examples of situations where it will be problematic, you will think otherwise.
---
If you don't like to PuG in 5 mans, then good for you. But a lot of people like to do that, so you're not contributing.
---
25% of all tickets during vanilla were loot related.
---
It was happening a ton across the millions of accounts that were playing the game.  
---
As an individual, I can think of maybe 2 instances across of all of vanilla me or any of my guild mates needed it, but they were relieved when the GM happily resolved it.  That doesn't seem like a lot, but when you consider the 10,000s of raid groups across the game, that is still literal thousands of tickets per week on this issue.
---
I'm looking for a Horde - Normal Server - NA guild for raiding. 
---
I played through part of Naxx back in Vanilla, but quit when BC came out. Currently playing on a pserver to get back in the swing of things and have come to the conclusion that I'm too old to deal with pvp server gankfest shit. 
---
Ahh ... resorting to namecalling and calling another person unreasonable for having a differing opinion.  I feel like a kid again
---
If you're in discord/teamspeak with someone, you tend to know them or are in the same guild.
---
Grouping with randoms for a casual dungeon and using in-game voip is just a bad idea - hence why nobody uses it in current WoW. 
---
It is, kind of.  
---
Most links to in game ncps, gear, objects, quests, etc are broken though. Hopefully they get that sorted out before launch.
---
I agree that it shouldn't be in the game as it would hurt the social aspect of dungeons and raids. But I see no reason why it couldn't be enabled ONLY if all members are of the same guild.
---
5/5 guild members = loot trading enabled
---
4/5 guild members = no loot trading
---
It could be applied to raids as well 40/40 guild members = loot trading enabled
---
Mistakes do happen and this would be a good way to allow some leeway on loot without anyone getting screw over by a guild abusing the system.
---
Just your basic American Psycho inspired kitchen.
---
I would hope this is something they'd do. The original epic mounts were removed in 1.4 so that would be the second stage they described in the new content schedule. 
---
I'm hoping they do some Q&amp;As soon so we can ask about small things like this. 
---
I don't understand the reasoning they gave for it, the whole "reduce number of GM tickets" thing.
---
Looting the item to the wrong person with Master Looter almost never happens. Why is a whole system being implemented to fix a problem that very rarely happens?
---
I' afraid you are missing my point. I don't really care about a crowded launch. It an inconvenience that lasts for a few week at best, and it surely sucks but  it is temporary and those who are super concerned abound it may just skip a week or two. All I care about is a long term health if the game, and your solution for launch i.e low caps will only   make the problem worse, so yeah...
---
Are you talking about going at level or under level by 1-3 levels?
---
Just read about all the problems it could cause on the other threads I linked. It's a bigger issue than you think.
---
I think it would be cool is they kinda "emulated" it inside the bnet launcher. So when you click the WoW Classic game tab, in the area to the right where the typical friends/news/promotions appear, instead there's a the classic "launcher" with retro themed news/promotions/friends list (calm down no-changers this isn't a gameplay item topkek). 
---
I guess that george w just disappeared huh?

Maybe not exactly what you were looking for, but could be nice to bookmark anyway.
---
The figure was something like 25% of all tickets were loot related.  When you consider how many tickets blizzard gets it's crazy.
---
Blizzard spent almost 1 year staffing up to the point where they could take the number of tickets the game was producing, it's like everyone forgot what 72 hour queue times were like back then.
---
Oh yes absolutely. The best farm spec is the best raid spec (32/19 combat swords) which is also still fantastic for PvP. Rogues have some of the more unique farming techniques in the game. 
---
What's that?
---
You are not adding in competing for mobs, greifing, low level pvp, travle times, corps runs.
---
You're wrong because people will still open GM tickets and blizzard will still need to hire GMs to tell people "no" so it's the worst of both worlds.
---
Can you tell me more or link that for me?
---
Yup, I finished the draft earlier today. I'll post it in a bit.
---
It was a part of the game like everything else and often used. Loot. Wasn't. Final. That's a fact.
---
&gt;jumping immediately to Ratchet / XR FP intensifies.
---
lol down vote me all you want you bunch of babies.  It's not going to change anything.  Welcome to loot trading Classic!!!!
---
Never seen or heard about anyone using this in vanilla, ever. I used it once when I accidentally deleted and item but that was in TBC.
---
that's true, I'm not contributing in an irrelevant whine fest. I'm impressed you pieced that together. 
---
Loot trading is as big of an issue as color blind mode being added. Blown entirely out of proportion by friendless weirdos terrified of the community they claim makes the game better. Why can't people just police themselves in the same way they do with ninjas? 
---
Rogues and warriors are the most in demand specs in the game besides Resto sham. Sometimes more so. Only problem is that there are many people ready to meet that demand, but it doesnt really matter at all. Trust me when I say EVERY guild will accept an exceptional applicant regardless of spec. If you really want to raid as fury or swords rogue, you will.
---
Mfw we get to tame rare pets again and reap actual benefits 
---
😎
---
Could you point me to one? :o
---
No loot trading end of story for PvE. In addition, I have been saying PvP rewards need to be handled properly. I do not want to see everyone running around with grand marshal gear. 
---
there people arent talking to someone,in that second picture there is a mob that spawns every 30 seconds and can only be kills by one party, each party has to kill 8 of them, then to top it off they have to kill 2 groups of said mob. and thats not it. there were other quests like that there. my imp quest took me probably 3 - 4x the time it should have, in that first picture i actually GAVE UP on that quest because of how long the spawn timer was and how many people were mobbed around the boss. and yes targeting the npc manually was what people did for maybe the first minute then they're like ok this just wont work then they all switch and make it even harder for everyone. it probably took over an hour maybe close to 2 to hit level 5. after i hit level 10 and WOW was that ever an experience.
---
Oh look, more shitstirring about retail, AKA a post irrelevant to Classic WoW. 
---
It's hidden?
---
These maps are absolutely fantastic. Keep them coming!
---
data I'm using:
---
- XP: 45+ (5 * clevel)
---
- XP for higher mobs: =XP * (1+0.05 * ((clevel + mob level difference) - clevel))
---
- XP for lower level mobs: XP * (1 - (clevel - (clevel-mob level difference)) / ZD)
---
- # of mobs in the dungeons, and their levels.
---
Now the last part might be off due to private servers, but it's not like these servers have wildly different mob layout. Deadmines on the private server I tested on had 183 mobs between level 17 and 21. It's not like Vanilla had 40, or 400.
---
It's gonna be pretty damn close.
---
What was the troll joke?
---

---
Let the crying begin!
---
For solo I'd say SL/SL warlock. Reasoning is how tanky they are. If you have full Naxx one can assume other people on the server have Naxx gear as well. This means one shotting specs are real and being able to survive a "one shot" attempt alone is really strong. Being able to recover from it and continue to wear down the enemy makes them my top pick.
---
In a BG I'd probably say ele shaman. They have ridiculous burst and unlike a PoM mage it is not on a 3 min CD for one shotting once you have Naxx gear. I'd say a Hunter might compete for this spot. The reason I pick those two instead of something like a rogue is due to being ranged in a BG is really strong.
---
With a healer it is probably a warrior, they have no reliance on mana and can just keep going on a killing spree. The healer makes sure he can stay alive when kited and versus some classes they can even just dispel roots / snares, thus removing their main weakness.
---
Yeah i skip those quests. Waste of time.
---
Locks will be popular because everyone wants to be an unkillable death machine in PvP. 
---
I believe blizz said that decursive won‘t be allowed in classic but i could be wrong.
---
Sure. But this thread was about raiding, so my points apply only to raiding.
---

---
there you go.
---
meh, I like the new models better. 
---
Depends on which one you mean I guess.
---
I just wanted to second how powerful the world buffs can be while leveling. Specifically, I remember getting the warchiefs blessing while leveling and it made the next hour a breeze. If your in Org and see a large guild gathering or hanging out, i'd suggest whispering someone to see if there gonna turn in a head for a buff. If they are, wait around, grab the buff, and then immediately fly/hearth to a good leveling area and start murdering mobs. It can really net you a ton of experience.
---
Hell no. I want to hit 60 at a reasonable pace and doing dungeons more than once while leveling is pretty much a waste of time. You only want to run each leveling dungeon once with every possible quest for the dungeon.
---
&gt;Grouping with randoms for a casual dungeon and using in-game voip is just a bad idea
---
Why?  Voice chat helps a lot for M+.  You press T click the headset icon and you're in voice.  Helps a lot at least if the tank and healer are talking to be on the same page regarding pacing.  If you don't like what you're hearing you press T click the headset icon and you're out of voice.  Why is this a bad idea?
---
Depends. For deadmines it's pretty tough but doable at 18, so that's where I started it. A few mobs start going gray at 23, so that's the outside limit of doing it. Same with stocks. 1st do it when it's doable, stop at gray mob level.
---
Was no Luna in Vanilla, so thats why most UI screenshots look like a total mess.

---
I understand. It’s difficult because it was different compared to now on private servers. While I think private servers are good for guidelines ultimately it should be changed to mimic original classic experiences in starting zones. I am for having more mobs spawns and make their respawn extremely fast. Since that is the least invasive.
---
That's great, I'll be unequipping my edgemaster's any time I'm in a group with nice people like you guys.
---
It's good money.
---
Wasnt an option for me being a warlock, Needed my imp. Plus there a couple groups that banded together and did the same thing and skip the early areas and they probably didnt do much better since i ended up passing them. Grunding ended up being slower since you had to grind in a team of 5 on low xp mobs to have a chance of hitting them. May work better on classic official since server caps will be lower plus potential sharding.
---
I have read all these thread and it's just not a big issue to me.
---
I would rather have legitimate trades be accessible to players.  That is the better experience to me.
---
What is the "official" go to for classic wow DB?
---
ST lead me to discover that you can actually swim/ go underwater as a ghost. Before that point i simply ran over any body of water while corpse running. One day in ST my group disbanded and i didn't figure out how to reach the etntrance as a corpse untill days later. 
---
You can’t leave us hanging. What’s your pronounciation?
---
If you're on a new server and following the guide and playing as often as everyone else, that's true. Otherwise you die a few seconds after your first tagged mob does.
---
ST really isnt a dungeon to be run multiple times. From my experience it can be useful around level 51 when there are plenty of quests to do there and a lot of XP to be had. a good boost going into the level 50 zones. But it isnt necessary to run for end game gear and I would argue it is a good break from questing/grinding, while still being able to get quests done, get good xp, and some decent loot for the level as well.
---
Wouldn't you need to charge after the buff cancel, or does it work on delay?
---
Skullcrusher and I will be the first to make Local Defense. You can buy guild from me for 1000 shiny golds. 
---
"hey can I get blessing of freedom"
---
"...why did I just get DI'd?"
---
&gt;implying people won't be constantly inspecting each other's gear.
---
who are the careless players?
---
The player base at large, they were the ones sending in the stream of loot related tickets.  There are SO many people playing that mistakes will happen, it's not one person constantly fucking up, it's any one of us making a mistake and wanting it resolved.
---
Of course you can theory craft, my damage was good and I sucked at min maxing in retail. I didn’t use engineer bombs at all when it is required to maximize dps in certain fights. Also in retail vanilla dps meters did not count pet damage as hunter damage and I still was very competitive. 
---
I’ll admit though that I felt really weak in early aq and early naxx but felt very strong again towards the end of both raids.
---
i dont believe so. Addons this time around will be much more sophisticated ( i assume) which should result in less congested screens. 
---
Agreed.
---
Loot trading in raids only, and only with Master Looter on.
---
There shouldn't be loot trading.
---
The end.
---
Yes, hence why I said "the only kind of loot people address here are BoPs". 
---
The thing is, though, that all the same abuse cases people bring up for that also apply to all other kinds of loot trading. Take one of those links from the OP: The issue of taking an item hostage to sell it. That's common practice for BoEs and you don't even need the guts to try and sell it to the very same people under whose nose you took it, you can sell it to anyone. 
---
Or take another issue: Multiple people rolling on the item to increase the odds of one person getting it. Same applies and the person who ultimately gets the item doesn't even need to be in the party. 
---
So... is this kind of behavior an issue that will poison the community? If so, loot needs to be final and all drops need to be BoP. If not... why are people making such a big fuss over loot trading again? 
---
I mean, if people simply hate loot trading because #NoChanges, I can respect that. But the arguments I see people bring up lead to far more drastic conclusions than people are willing to draw, which makes them seem hypocritical. 
---
so if ML is active, loot trading will be enabled?
---
&gt; Razorgore
---
Fuck that boss. I mean it's a great fight, but man it's harder to master than any other in BWL. We wiped for a solid 2 weeks on Razorgore and didn't struggle nearly as much with any other bosses till we hit Twin Emps 
---
It was final in 99.99% of the cases.
---
No reason whatsoever to implement a system that will fuck up the game 100%, to counter 0.01% of the cases when loot was fixed by a GM.
---
Ninja looting is clear as day to see. Spotting loot trading ninjas would require tracking every individual's gear. It's hard to see and a massive pain in the ass. 
---
Neat, but is wowhead still an infected hive of adware/malware?
---
It's not that hard to keep track of the ninjas and avoid them, I plan to do my 5 mans with players I don't feel would job the loot trading system to ninja more.  It's not hard to avoid these people at all.
---
I don't plan on being a master looter personally, but I do know if a mistake was honestly made, I want the players to be able to resolve that.  This has more long term benefit to me than a few less ninjas in 5 mans.
---
Its absolutely a retail/private server side affect of not being part of 2 thousand player *tops* community on a single server.
---
You see the SAME people day in and day out.  You know the backstory of almost every regular player.  Its like a small town.
---
Retail players and private servers players are like people from large cities who don't give a flying fuck and expect these smaller classic servers to have the same perspective.  They're going to have a bad time.
---
Social consequences are very real, and these people are totally clueless. Life becomes a lot harder in an actual MMO when no one wants to play with you because you're a scumbag.
---
I hear ya man.  I loved hitting dungeons for grinding back in vanilla ! I remember gathering groups in org to take the zip line to stv and then running the coastline up to west fall to kill Van Cleef in that one mine dungeon. It was a fucking blast. We would sometimes have a hunter train a boar and name it boar and get alliance to attack it thinking it was just that so we could jump em and then run like hell into the dungeon when their mains finally started to show up lol 
---
I agree, the main problem is that loot overall will lose its value so to say by making it possible to trade it. I do hope they changed their minds about loot trading for raids and dungeons, I don't care if they use it for vendors though since I know how easy it is to buy the wrong item if you're tired or whatever.
---
yeah I'd rather have no Loot Trading and no GM intervention, or Loot Trading only with Masterloot active
---
&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA-PVP| semi-hardcore
---
Undaunted is recruiting members prior to the release of classic wow. Welcoming all players that are experienced or new with determination to progress at a steady rate and dedication on making the guild a better experience overall. We want to have a strong core of members when the game launches.
---
This guild will be semi-hardcore, Horde, and with a laid back demeanor but still seeking to progress with a goal to leave no one behind for those that show up on raid times, etc. Ideally a strong core roster of experienced players would be preferred to help out around the guild and bring everyone up to speed. We want a good sense of community within this guild so don’t be afraid to speak up and talk to others, in the end remember to just have fun with the game as well.
---
We will be doing PVE and PVP content with raids times being listed below but we do enjoy world pvp when we get the chance, perhaps even forming BG groups later on when they get introduced. When raiding starts we will be doing 3 nights a week. We are currently recruiting all classes, just play what you feel like.
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 7:30 - 10:30 est
---
We currently have a discord channel. We have tabs for class/dungeon guide talk to help people out not familiar with classic wow and you can usually find me in general voice chat. Feel free to add me on discord or bnet for more info on joining it.
---
Bnet: Feral#11785 Discord: Feral#0846
---
IDGAF about prestige. I just want to get to the part of the game I enjoy most.
---
This.
---
Oh well too bad!!
---
Frankly I have no understanding of how anyone is able to do that and find it interesting. That said, different people play the game for different reasons. Some people want to be the first to clear something or beat something, some others want a relaxed casual experience.
---
I'm definitely in the latter now as a fully grown adult, but when vanilla was out I was definitely in the former group.
---
He's between business meetings, checking in on how much xp the butler has been able to grind out that morning.
---
Actually, NO.
---
Loot fixed by GMs barely happen couple times a month per realm.
---
The TICKETS were 99.99% from retarded idiots that had no idea that BoP actually means BoP.
---
This line of thinking is how retail ended up the way it is.
---
I really think we would be throwing the baby out with the bath water here.  Will loot trading affect some runs?  Yes.  However, the number of players shafted by loot trading will pale in comparison to the number shafted if they don’t.  Every miss click by a ML, every accidental need roll, etc. will be an issue.
---
Moreover, the rage of being denied a fix by a GM will be massive.  The outcry will be real.  People will complain that Blizzard should just spend more money on GMs.
---
Of all the issues they have given ground on, I think we should give them a pass here.
---
getting to 60 in the very first wave lets you farm way more than anyone else. overall, it actually saves you many hours of playtime further down the road as far as farming gold is concerned
---
Why would everyone have gm gear? 
---
Nolifers were always thought of as nolifers. There will still be the nolifers that people love, and the ones that people hate.
---
Like, there was a gnome warlock on our server in Vanilla who was *always* online, but would often boost lowbies for free. Conversely there was a guy who got to 60 before most players and then spent every day ganking.
---
the reason why nochanges is off the table is because activision managers are greedy sacks of shit and won't allow classic to cost one dime more than it has to. 
---
Tickets cost a huge amount of money because of the CMs you need to have (John Staats book mentions CM cost as the main contributing factor of overall cost)
---
Mistakes can and will happen.
---
Once in a blue moon.
---
No reason to implement a system that will basically kill the game.
---
Hey, not all of us tauren players intentionally pun our names. If the hoofplate fits, you know?
---
go to blizzcon 12 years ago or look it up yourself.
---
It's common knowledge.
---
But that's sort of the point, if the average player only ever had an issue with loot once or maybe twice in their entire time playing vanilla, is it really the end of the world if a GM refused to correct the mistake? 
---
It sucks to have a loot mixup but in the grand scheme of things it's a pretty small issue, and loot trading just replaces this issue with an even bigger and more expoitable issue.
---
Don't forget sharding.
---
derpderpderp hashtagnochanges
---
Dont understand how loot trading is going to collapse the social structure of the game.  I bet all of you same Chicken Littles would vehemently oppose dual specs even though it would instantly improve the lives of your tanks and healers as well as offer pures a pve and pvp spec option without the gold sink.
---
Oh but no that would mean people would have a couple extra gold in their pocket, cant fucking have any of that.
---
You think that we think people will respect us for playing a video game 18 hours a day?
---
Just cause you didn't hear about it, doesn't mean the millions of vanilla players weren't using it.
---
I'm against sharding. In those areas you **can't** skip quests or questing somewhere else...
---
If it prevent this. Sharding no more than 3 days after release **and** in the starting zones only then it's ok.
---
After that it'll ruin the experience.
---
Nice suit! I had a CRT Screen until 2010. 
---
This got me thinking. Perhaps you should only equip them during your guild's raids so people wouldn't know? Though if they're enchanted it's pretty obvious that you've scamazed them.
---
They will. And on right-click report.
---
Just wait and see.
---
Probably in 2 weeks or so, the next blue post will be about loot trading...namely announcing that loot trading won't happen at all, or only with ML on.
---
Server transfers are blizzlike, they did have a 3 (or was it 6?) month cooldown when they were first introduced though.
---
Race changes i couldn't give fewer shits about tbh.
---
Name changes? That's a nope for me dawg. 
---
This is the second time I've asked, but you should really complete all of them &amp; compile them. I'd love to download them &amp; have my desktop cycle through them :)
---
What type of server are you planning to form on. I'd be interested if you will be running on a Normal type server.
---
I don't think they do it just for prestige. In fact I think a minority of max level racers actually even remotely think of it this way.
---
In reality, everyone just minds their own business.
---
Exactly. The only fight up until 4 horseman (I have never been in Naxx in vanilla so im just pretending to know...) where every single person had a specific job. Most of the bosses in BWL or in MC were doable with half the raid autoattacking, if the other half did their job, but not Razorgore. You needed almost perfect execution, druids sleeping dragons, shamans kiting them around, tanks in each corner, ranged dps cross damaging mobs, etc... it was just a beautiful chaos, I really loved the fight.
---
Helps level friends, which makes it worth it.
---
Remove any loot related option from the ticket interface.
---
Done:D
---
I'm having the same issues. Might just start my own guild and try to find like minded people myself. Too old for the pvp server gankfest nonsense. 
---
Well since were getting the new client with classic, you can do super giant weak auras. I haven’t seen too much fuss about how newer addons will trivialize a lot of content. 
---
Kinda yeah, because if that item is something the player worked 6 months for and they get frustrated and up and quit that sucks.  This isn't the outcome you want for the overall health of the game, and it's prevented by having a system to correct mistakes.
---
To me, that is more game breaking than an increase in ninja looting in 5 mans.
---
Well I think server caps in general should be implemented. IDK what the number should be but from what ive read somwhere 2.5-4k range seems reasonable. I get that launch over pop is only a problem for \~2 weeks but you could argue the same for the other side, if people dont want to deal with mob competition just wait a few weeks to start. Sharding just doesnt seem right to me. I want to hate the druid moonfiring all the mobs right in front of me and then run into him in SM and realize he is a good dude, ya know? If im just leveling in virtually my own world from the beginning, that hurts the community aspect that made Vanilla so great IMO. 
---
Not having loot trading and not having any option for loot in the ticket interface saves them more money.
---
You really don't understand basic human nature.
---
It won't kill the game
---
millions of people playing, so from Blizzards end it isn't once in a blue moon, it's a constant stream of always happening.
---
It's only to an individual player that it doesn't happen a lot.
---
One looks like it's from a 2004 game, the other looks like it's from a 2018 game.
---
No this line of thinking is how WoW was founded
---
Get a history lesson
---
It really isn't. Inspect before during or after rolling if you're that concerned. I'd be shocked if there wasn't an add-on in the first month anyway. Retail is full of loot tracking add-ons for people to beg for gear. 
---
Sadly the abused always kick downwards :( Would be much better if people took the fight to the gankers on their high level toons and not fly to another zone to take out their frustrations.
---
I agree, I think the majority of people who will be playing classic (consistently after the tourists leave) will be adults, mid/late 20's+. 
---
We're no longer impressed by adults no-lifeing a game, it'll impress teenagers and kids for sure, I remember being impressed by that first time around in vanilla/tbc/wotlk. But I think for most of us it will be indicative of a poor adult working life/family ethic, as pretentious as that sounds. 
---
Those committing to a retail style "gogogo" attitude to be world first at everything won't get the respect of their peers that such achievements used to. 
---
&gt; for a legitimate reason 
---
Name A SINGLE legitimate reason.
---
Can confirm, it's like adding another 20% physical damage reduction as soon as you train Dire Bear. It is glorious. However, if you have to purchase new plate gear (our leather armor just becomes more valuable with the Dire Bear multiplier, we don't need to spend gold on new armor types) then it becomes a toss up IMO. If the gear has solid stats but is mail, just keep it for a bit until plate with good states comes along.
---
\#bearz4lyfe
---
I’ll probably play mostly without addons, but it will give an amazing FoV. 
---
For paladin I guess I could use half the screen to just have two giant icons; one for HS and one for bubble - like a panic button.
---
well on classic really only the hunter and warlock need to stay around the low level areas (the imp and hunter pet quests) every other class can be free to go whenever, and will more than likely leave as soon as possible if there is an abundance of people on every mob. so yeah there needs to be sharding in the starting zones for the first weekish. Remember, not everyone may be starting on launch day, some people might have to way awhile to start and if it doesnt launch on a weekend it would make sense to hold sharding for a whole week so people who couldn't get time off get time to start on a Friday or Saturday.
---
&gt; Loot trading abusers can easily be recognized  
---
That's the wrong part. It's not easy at all, and if done correctly it can even go unnoticed. In order to identify people doing that in your back you would need to inspect them before the run, and after. Also, if someone chooses to buy something from someone in your group, although you were higher than the said guy when rolling, you won't be aware of it.
---
It will also generally create an atmosphere where there will be people that all the time ask you for buying what you won for some golds. Yes you can say no, but it is really annoying.
---
Bottom line, loot trading cases where it brings useful things are limited. And in the other hand it creates frustration for some players. Let's just get rid of it, in 5 mans at least.
---
Gotcha. Hopefully addons will be a little more sophisticated this time around :)
---
I wish there was some sort of reason to go beyond that tent to the far right, and closer to that waterfall.
---
Like maybe one quest. Maybe put what's his, Jared or whatever. The guy who's head you need to cut off. 
---
Yeah I think it'd be better to put that guy there actually.
---
&gt; If you have a dream team no life group to blast through dungeons it should out pace questing.
---
I've done a fair bit of math on this. In order for Deadmines grouping to be more efficient than grinding / questing (given the same dream team / no life mentality, only solo) @ level 20, you'll have to do it in 28 minutes per run.
---
At level 26, 16 minute stock runs are needed to beat out questing / grinding.
---
Hey, somebody's gotta keep up with those gold farmer accounts that'll be running 24/7 within an hour of the game launching.
---
(True story: We accidentally invited one of those accounts into our small guild during the original Vanilla launch period. We were incredibly impressed with his levelling abilities, until we realised that our guildie was actually *at least* two separate people, and they were upsetting the rest of the server with some of their antics.)
---
That’s why I always play non-human races and mostly casters because you can get a bow and arrow and swords, daggers and stuff in real life. You can’t do magic.
---
Not true at all.
---
GMs in vanilla were CONSTANTLY restoring items for the MILLIONS of players across their realms.
---
There was even a special divisions of GMs for this, if you were getting an item restored your ticket was sent to a specialist (and you would be informed as such) an entire separate higher tier of GM that was trusted SPECIFICALLY for these issues.
---
Also, I am willing to bet you have never seen a WoW ticket you didn't submit, cause no one who did would ever think it only happened a couple times a month and was only happening to idiots.
---
My first time zoning into WoW was in Darnassus to a bunch of naked dancing night elves.
---
I knew this would be the game for me ever since. 
---
If you can earn 400gph by farming the devilsaurs without competition then I’d say it’s worth spending a lot of time in the start. 
---
Yeah cool, thanks!

That's brilliant!

Typical UD rogue ;P
---
That must be true because I really can't wrap my head around fear mongering something remotely this inconsequential. Maybe I'm better than everyone, probably, but you'd think other people might even accidentally think about things every once in awhile. 
---
Amazing ! I'd love to see Redrige Mountain ! 
---
**\*IF\*** you have a dream team who are not only good at the game, but willing to do what you're doing and spend every waking in-game second in dungeons. That's a very big if and the OP did say "finding a group non stop". If even one of those players has to drop out for any length of time / reason there's a chance the replacement you find will be useless.
---
Competing for mobs will only really be a major problem at the beginning, PVP/ganking is a decision you choose to deal with. Death is very avoidable if you're good enough at the game to consider dungeon powerleveling. 
---
Sharding isn't confirmed at all, but if they do it it's only going to be either 1-6 or 1-12 max. Guess what you can't do until level 10 *minimum*? Dungeons. OP will still have no choice but to take the absolute worst of the clumping.
---
There's no feasible way to work this out mathematically other than send OP in headfirst. Godspeed. 
---
As a skinner I really enjoyed doing that dungeon NGL
---
Bro I just want to grab those pigtails and *pull*
---
I for see them modifying how PvP rewards are obtained. Old system relied on to much time played vs skill. I know I had to play a shit ton in addition to performing well with a group to obtain field marshal, I never actually made it to GM.
---
As much as I hope they keep the old system, I don't know if they will.

Ninjas are constantly brought up on this subreddit.  They will be there, they will ninja.  The only way to combat ninjas are the features you people vehemently oppose for the sake of forcing this project to emulate a time machine.

If we cant completely stop ninjas, can we get a little QoL ffs?
---
I'm more concerned with right click reporting, can we get something like this post together about that, please? ;-;

Stand around in Gadgetzen being obnoxious by jumping around and in front of Horde players while doing /rude to them. Eventually instigating them to attack me then watch in pure delight as the guards would one shot them into oblivion. Then /lol as the rezed and try to get them to do it all over again. 
---
I’m talking about paths to bosses and mobs for rewards, not mob skips. There’s a huge level and loot disparity which makes most of the bosses worthless, depending on your level 
---
NO LOOT TRADING.  BOE is BOE.  BOP is BOP.  That's that.  Make Classic Classic Again.
---
2.5k concurrent isnt that small dude.  The world was plently alive, even crowded, during vanilla. 
---
It's funny because after the first razorgore kill we wiped it twice more ever, something just seemed to click. I was raid leader at the time so always got to orb control, was always squeaky bum time when you mass fireball and try and get those last two eggs down. 
---
The concern with all this is what happens when a group of people all target a single guy and that guys gets silenced, it isn't a great system at all but I stand by that it's not a big deal either, imo of course. Those people would get punished if the victim simply submits a ticket and doesn't react, if they continue, which most won't, they'll get banned harder the next time. I know my experience is anecdotal and I know poor situations happened before, but mistakes happen everywhere I'm not surprised blizzard had some GMs drop the ball at times
---
Screen tip? Make a tool tip. Whenever entering a group they have to check a box accepting the current loot rules.
---
Pala can be fun and can be boring, depends of yours playstyle.

Atm leveling pala on pserver, duo with my warrior friend - it's fun, but solo leveling can be boring if you don't have second display or tv for watching while autoswingin.

I'm a huge advocate for changes to vanilla. But there are changes that make vanilla a better version of vanilla, and changes that simply move vanilla towards a different aesthetic more akin to modern WoW. Your posts in this thread show you clearly have no understanding of what makes vanilla tick, regardless of how much you may have enjoyed vanilla in the past.

You probably shouldn't comment if you don't have a coherent thought on the topic.

First night of BWL progression, two of our healers realize that they forgot to touch Drak's orb to finish the attunement quest and can't get in to BWL. We can't raid with out them, so 8 people run them through UBRS to that portal (faster than running all the way to Drak) while the rest of us cycle through getting the LBRS fire buff.
---
If you play more than me, you’re a no life poopsocker who should be ashamed of their life.
---
If you play less than me, you’re a filthy scrub, and you need to up your game.  
---
The private servers with 10k+ seem smaller than they are because of rampant language barriers, restricting you to only interact with a fraction of the community within.
---
2.5k-3k is PLENTY for a Vanilla server, especially without dynamic respawns screwing around with resource availability and the economy.
---
Initial sharding will prevent this, and I'm on board. They've stated they only intend to shard for the first week or so, and only in the first few zones. Think 1-10 zones, and MAYBE westfall/barrens. We'll see about that one. I trust them.
---
How the fuck did I end up in /r/esfand
---
Ok cool, so when you get called out and your faction (of probably only 1.5k active high level players) /ingore, you won't be able to do any pve content outside your raid.
---
Nice plan.
---
Well one concern doesn't prevent the other from happening. And you can do that yourself :p (I only looked to the other threads with the search tool. Very easy to do).
---
!RemindMe Soon

I've been wondering if it's possible to call out to webservices from within an addon. Like imagine an addon that automatically reports raid attendance to a web service to help automate Suicide Kings.

---
That's what I thought. What do you mean by DW though? Dual Wield? Cause it is learned from the trainer in 1.12 and I don't recall doing any quest on retail.
---
Good luck beating a warlock that just facetanks you, heals more than you damage them and drains your mana.
---
I miss looted grear to the wrong ppl several times, raid were long, I was tired, people had similar names. That or I was on autopilot and gave the item to the guild disenchanter because I didn't expect anyone to want it after killing the boss 30 times.
---
Mistakes happen, sucks if there isnt a way to fix it but meh, loot drops again.
---
Would stuck balls if your master looter sent the eye to a priest named arlion instead of the main tank called arleon tho. 
---
but they are soulless
---
Still have this bad boy on my rogue on retail. Love it!
---
I'm not sure why you're making a chicken out of a feather. You're trying very hard to make your point seem smarter than it is and it's a bit cringy. 
---
People don't ninja lockboxes or cloth (not that you roll for cloth anyway), because it's not worth disbanding the group over a 50 silver item. But that rare BoP blue? That's a different story. You can't get it elsewhere. It's a completely different story. In fact, that's a situation that has never existed in WoW before because later expansions that had loot trading also had need before greed looting rules by default, and this was not the case in vanilla (there was a similar option that nobody ever used because it was broken as fuck).
---
About the only remotely valid part of your point is BoE epics which are so exceedingly rare that it's hilariously hypocritical that you even bring them up as you claim _we_ are the ones drawing "drastic conclusions". This niche situation existing once every 200 dungeons is no excuse for a system which allows it to happen every single other dungeon.
---
&gt; In order to identify people doing that in your back you would need to inspect them before the run, and after.
---
Yup. That's a matter of seconds. As I said, easy. 
---
&gt; Also, if someone chooses to buy something from someone in your group, although you were higher than the said guy when rolling, you won't be aware of it.
---
I don't get what you're trying to say here. Are you referring to a case where 3 guys roll on an item, someone rolls 90 and wins it, you roll 80 and the third guy who rolled 70 decides to buy the item from the guy who won it? You'll easily notice that as well. You can see who won the item. You can see if said person doesn't equip it but someone else does.
---
&gt; It will also generally create an atmosphere where there will be people that all the time ask you for buying what you won for some golds. Yes you can say no, but it is really annoying.
---
I don't think so. You can start calling those persons out, you know? Maybe people will try to buy stuff often in the beginning, but it will quickly fade away to become a rarity. Plus where do you think all these guys will get their gold from to do stuff like that? Gold is limited in Classic.
---
or go to blizzcon 12 years ago when they broke it all down for us, your choice.
---
Yeah, common stuff right? Let's just inspect and remember everything everyone is wearing. Simply as that.
---
And then you're saying that there will be an addon for that. So that is an issue. But instead of simply throw away all that toxic loot trading things, you're basically saying there will be other more complicated workarounds.
---
Great logic.
---
Oooooh, I forgot about one of my favorite past times!
---
Hunting down bot account farmers and inevitably camping the farmers who come to investigate why their bot isn't making them any money.
---
And I will be waiting in anticipation
---
&gt; Maybe I'm better than everyone, probably 
---
If being an trolling a\*\*hole that bothers losing his time in threads that don't concern him, then yes you're better than everyone.
---
Probably.
---
How do you get this? Is this something that was actually in vanilla wow?
---
I like this idea. For anyone who wants to bypass this, have an option right next to it that auto accepts all rules. 
---
GMs will be required. It was a buggy game. 
---
So you use your own experience in the post I answer to. Then I use my experience and u downvote me? Lol cool logic bro. Also pulling numbers out of thin air, a true internet argument.
---
Will there even be master loot?
---
&gt;  Trust me when I say EVERY guild will accept an exceptional applicant regardless of spec.
---
oh yeah just be a tryhard 4head :\
---
The one perspective I can see is trying to get to 60 and partially geared up as fast as possible to world pvp and raid towns with.
---
PvE content races imo are the lamest thing you could strive for. People already know the ins and out of the boss fights and even have lists of optimal pve raid gear... *how exciting*.
---
Camping and controller the flight master in Storm wind or Orgrimmar the first 3 weeks into Classic launch with fresh 60s? Now that is fun.
---
They'll get tickets for other things saying loot please. It's what we used go do when we ran into this issue. It bogs down the system.
---
Neato
---
Yep, solves the problem of missclicks which is pretty easy to do given you have a list of 40 people all in tiny font.
---
Yikes. Let it all out, little buddy. 
---
That would have an interesting impact on groups. Would you have to choose loot policy straight from the start. You could avoid situations where right before the boss dies the leader swaps to ML. But then you also lose things like BRD IF reserver runs where you only swap to ML on the last boss.
---
I don't even think it's possible with the modern LUA, and even if it was, it would be probably considered botting.
---
Let me try to put this on your level.
---
Problem not very big. 
---
Problem small. 
---
Problem other solution. 
---
Don't care about small problem. 
---
Better things think about. 
---
That's fine, just meant to point it out and give an opinion, wasn't meant to be one-uppy, sorry lol
---
Most people that rush do it for the benefits of rushing and very rarely out of prestige or spite. Not sure why there are so many ass hurt casual players on this sub all the time acting like the world revolves around them and that hardcore players are a disservice to them just because they play the game differently than you. 
---
Quit acting like a bitch because people enjoy playing the game differently. 
---
That's the whole point people are trying to make. We're not asking Blizz to staff up GMs to handle complaints, we're just saying make loot final and move on.
---
Don't worry about it too much. 1.12 addons won't be compatible with Classic, so you're better off looking at what retail UI/addons look like, because there is a better chance those are gonna have a Classic version.
---
Wowhead is trash. It feels bloated and it's hard to read shit. What I want us ehat wowhead doesnt have
---
Maybe don't play with dicks? Isn't vanill all about server community? How hard is it to find 5 or 10 people to play with that can vouch for each other?
---
If you were playing with people you actually like and trust instead of friendless weirdos then loottrading is a none issue.
---
If you are constantly pugging with the dregs of the server that act like dickbags and abuse the system then maybe you belong in that group.
---
I think the biggest problem I could see with progressive items / talents / class design is the true min/max world first people who are rushing are going to basically need to keep bis on multiple classes so whenever a phase turns, they can update to whatever is OP and broken in that phase. People will know exactly when to play which class and everything and swap around.  Doesn't seem like the right way to go about it.
---
I really hope that it is the 1.12 version of items and drops for dungeons that are out. I understand DM being held back and such.  And I am more-or-less fine with waiting for Phase 5 for the tier 0.5 and some of the gear that was added in later patches to hit the loot tables (though personally i'd be fine if a place like UBRS / Scholo / Etc. that is out in P1, still drops gear added in 1.10 instead of waiting for gear and having to wait until phase 5 to run it). 
---
I don't think it's 100% which items are and aren't going to be changed or missing come phase 1.  Like all things blizz, their wording is vague enough to leave them room.  They said they looked at items that provide a boost and then state tier 0.5 as an example.. granted those were a quest to acquire.  they also said many loot tables, not all loot tables.  Also talked about drop rates and locations for loot drops pre-relics.   It would be wishful thinking on both sides. Only time will tell.
---
"hop in vent"
---
Real vanilla confirmed.
---
I've been the victim of misclicks in raid loot. Still 100% certain that loot trading will lead to a shitty version of WoW.
---
Fuck off with that bullshit.
---
You could illustrate my d&amp;d games for years to come
---
Ah MT targets from CTRaid made it the most mandatory addon back in the day.
---
I actually miss back before targets (skull/x/triangle etc.) were added to the game.
---
Wait were they in Vanilla? I don't remember them
---
Most likely either a green gun or the Willey's Portable Howitzer from Strat Live cannonmaster.
---
I didn't down vote you and I am using the numbers blizzard gave us at their thing they throw to tell us about this stuff.
---
The point is accordingly to Blizzard they say 25% of the tickets are loot related and this is why they need to implement the fix.  You can believe that or not, but that is the basis of why we have loot trading.
---
Blizzard gets a shit load of tickets and 25% are loot related according to them.  They need a resolution for 25% of their problems.
---
Tof! Veel succes met de site
---
Love it!
---
I'm curious as to what class you would play and which skills would you not learn?
---
Not to mention everything everyone wore ever. It's not like it's hard to preemptively equip different gear than drops in the zone to enable you to trade.
---
Sadly, this is an issue where this sub-reddit just works itself up into a rage around the scenario where a random player running with a group of friends will get screwed, and magically the group of friends won't be caught or won't face social consequences. 
---
Name / realm changes promotes poor community &amp; encourages ninjas + griefers by allowing them a way to quickly obfuscate themselves to the rest of the players.
---
&gt;If the gear has solid stats but is mail, just keep it for a bit until plate with good states comes along.
---
Yeah this works. I just like buying 3-4 plate items to replace my worst mail items at that level. If I can find something with a decent amount of stamina/str on it then thats an excellent improvement to tanking.
---
That book is based on WOTLK API. There is a newer edition available but it was for TBC API. There aren't many books for the Vanilla API that I know of.
---
i would hate to see sharding in the barrens... the barrens is big enough to not need it.
---
 Only problem with hitting 60 so fast is that there aren't many people to do dungeons with. Even if you hit 60 first you still can't level professions easily because everyone is still leveling in those zones
---
All in a day's work.
---
Who cares what people think? If you're a casual then be a casual, if you're a mix-maxer then be a min-maxer. If you feel the need to whisper people that nolife up to 60 with that kind of garbage then you're the problem.
---
Good lore why do people keep bringing up more GMs. Nobody who is opposed to loot trading is asking for Blizz to spend a dime on GMs. What we are saying is just tell people to suck it up.
---
I like how you copied [someone else's post form /r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/b004ps/in_honor_of_kul_tirans_coming_out_tomorrow_have_a/) (which was about the graphical/stylistic progression of the game), cropped it, and posted it here trying to bash retail. Good job!
---
It's not possible to communicate with anything outside the game at all. Not even local files. The best you can do is to save data that gets written to an external file ONLY when the game exits or when you reload the UI. Also, local files are read in ONLY when you start the game or reload the UI. There is no realitime 2-way communication with local files or outside services in any way.
---
It’s a [quest item](https://www.wowhead.com/item=5462/dartols-rod-of-transformation) from Ashenvale. A lot of people would do the quest to get the item then never finish the quest line, therefore being able to keep the item. 
---
My issue is that the reason behind adding loot sharing is not a sound one. A simple fix is to just say from the get go that they will not be handling loot issues with GMs. If an item went to the wrong person, tough nuggets. 
---
The problem will work itself out in that people will leave the guild if it’s a master loot issue, or if ninja rolled, don’t run with that person anymore and eventually they will have a poor reputation.
---
I foresee more issues with ninja looting with loot sharing, actually. Say I’m running a dungeon with 3 buddies and we PUG a fifth. Say an item drops that my friend and the PUG wants. All four of us roll need against the one guy and it gives us a much greater chance at getting that loot for our buddy. 
---
Yea, I was mostly kidding. I’ve never raid healed, so it’ll be a new experience regardless. Looking forward to digging in.
---
Udderfailure
---
Im late to this party but could anyone explain what the issue is and why its bad/good?
---
And bots.
---
Private servers have _so many_ bots.
---
lol why wouldn't it?
---
Bedankt Harm! Dat gaat vast lukken :)
---
The only one I'm completely against is name change. I still don't like Faction and Race changes, but I can see arguments for it. Barbershop honestly should be just put in, it's literally just a cosmetic thing like your hair, who cares?
---
I don't owe you shit, so stop asking.  It's absurd you think I do.
---
Look it up yourself or take my word for it.  the number doesn't even matter.  Whatever the number is it's enough for Blizzard to think they need to resolve the issue.
---
I would like to know how the mount prices will be. Remember that at first it was the mount that costed a lot and the skill was cheap. And then it switched. This would make some people just skip the lvl 40 mount and save their gold for the epic one at 60 instead (druids, shamans and hunters). Or if it comes during phase 2 you just simply buy the lvl 60 skill and wait until the switch before you buy ur epic mount for 100g. That would make the cost 200g total for epic mount.
---
Every new server post launch had increased mob spawns at when they opened up. Mobs and quest items spawned literally the second after they died for the first week or so.
---
They already solved this problem back in vanilla and its something i and a lot of people that liked rolling on fresh servers experienced and look forward to again. I dont see why they need to replace it with sharding.

I’d love to see new content in vanilla. There were plenty of places and ideas to further expand the original content but I don’t hold hopes over that possibility.
---
I asked you to provide a source for your claim and you're just telling me to "look it up myself" over and over, now getting offensive and insulting me, so I'm just going to assume your claim is false.
---
Yeah I'm on the fence on if I think we'll see it there. I do think it wouldn't be a massive deal if it was there though. Definitely not beyond it though.
---
well I disagree, it's not what WoW was founded on and personally I think your version is the inferior version of WoW.  Fuck off with THAT bullshit.

Moostafa

I remember my guilds all used FFA, so I just dont remember ML in the game. But it looks like it was, my bad.
---
Blizzcon is my source.  I can't pull that up
---
4-5 day wait &gt; people needing for their friends. Why are people so impatient? You'll be playing the game for years. 4-5 days wait is nothing.
---
That's awesome! Would it take you out of this form if you casted something? Or could you do all your normal actions in this form?
---
Indeed. That's why it's not listed on the map!
---
I just had always played Draenei when ever possible, and in classic back in the day I just played a night elf rogue, cause they were sneaky, so it made sense to me.
---
Ahhhhhh! It burns us!
---
I will say I am looking forward to using my ultra-wide monitor with Classic. 
---
There is a simple solution if you made a honest mistake, you go and redo it and hope for a drop.
---
No need to fundamentally change the game because you fumble master looting.
---
The orientation of that place is so confusing. I always thought it was northwest. At least, that's the directly I think I'm heading when I go there. But turns out it's on the top center.
---
If I remember right the appearance only broke if you took damage. So you could enter combat and keep it as long as you didn’t take any damage. 
---
I almost wanna say that should be an option with the caveat being that if you dispute something it would be used against you as you agreed to the rules. Those who don't agree can leave.
---
Loot trading is too dangerous to be left in.
---
I played retail vanilla way back when, it wasn't that much of a problem. it was nothing like lfg instapops, but I've also sat in lfg as a dps for hours in retail wotlk - and there's also server times on high pop servers where it's a ghost town. there's no perfect number imo, everything has good and bad
---
I'm ok with slightly larger realms - but I'm not worried about 2500-3000 pop
---
Yeah, some people just make it a challenge to get there first. If i had the time i'd race to 60 aswell.
---
So then instead of wasting money and time, you just make loot soulbound.
---
You messed up master loot? tough luck, but you can just go and do it again until you get the drop.
---
Changing the game for people not paying attention changes it for e v e r y o n e, and that you cannot just do again.
---
We're talking about loot requests here. Not GM interventions altogether.
---
&gt; Why is a whole system being implemented to fix a problem that very rarely happens?
---
Given that Blizzard are the ones with the data on how often this happens, it could very well be that the sheer size of the playerbase means that they've had to deal with a large volume of support tickets for this over the years. Before the recent layoffs, [100 support staff took a paid option to leave the company](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/333478/100_support_staff_take_cash_offer_and_voluntarily_leave_Blizzard.php) last year.
---
This so much. Better than him? Noliver! Worse than him? Fuckn noob. L2p. 
---
riposte not worth getting? trading 1 point from endurance
---
I wonder if impSnD 3/3 is more important than 3/3 impEvis I mean if iSND 2/3 &gt; iEv 3/3
---
If "players nowadays" don't want to spend an hour forming a PUG group in Vanilla WoW, they probably shouldn't be playing Vanilla WoW. By end game you should be in a guild or have a friends list to help alleviate the problem. 
---
There is a difference though, at a certain point you cannot just say "oh well they intended it this way" when that way is quite frankly, stupider.
---
&gt;Taladril
---
That's the Druid guy!
---
Well that depends, I've seen some tanks with REALLY shit gear, when combined with already somewhat low level for the zone makes me think this run won't be worth my time. But just because they didn't move to 100% plate once they dinged 40..that's now how gearing in vanilla worked.
---
Are you me? I look back at my WoW years as the best and worst experience of my life, haha. I was just so enthralled and addicted to the game that I wanted/needed to play ALL of the time. Being the main tank for my raiding guild partly attributed to that, hehe. I was in high school/college during those times, and I had pretty much all of the free time in the world. Except when I was in college, I was skipping  class more often than not to play. The friendships and camaraderie I established with my guild mates was what kept me going, and I still play other games with some of them even to this day. 
---
Also during that time though, I had that worst diet, and I was sitting in front of my computer most of the day playing WoW. So I gained a ton of weight. Since I was skipping class a lot of the time, I pretty much flunked my first two years of college which put me behind since I had to make up for that lost time, which then put me behind in my career since I missed out on two years of experience. 
---
For the most part, I've got my life together. I've lost a lot of the weight that I had put on since I eat better and make sure to go to the gym since I still sit at my computer most days for work. I'm married, and my career is back on track. I really want to play Classic WoW, but I'm also kind of hesitant because I'm afraid of going back down that rabbit hole, lol. 
---
I guess I could be okay with having a monthly limit on trades. Give someone 3 trades on mistaken loot per month.
---
Then at least it will be limited to the very best loot only if people are going to scam.
---
You are really shooting yourself in the foot by not just showing it, it makes you look like a fool and your entire point nullified.
---
Or you are just a clear troll.
---
Getting to 60 early isnt about "prestige" lol. It puts you in a very advantageous position. You can set yourself up as one of the first/only enchanters and make tons of gold for instance. Or just control the price pf something trivial in the AH. You can be literally the only person farming black lotus or devilsaur leather. Ypu can get a huge early lead on the PvP rank grind. Getting to 60 early is such a big advantage it can potentially set you up financially for the rest of the server. 
---
You wanted vanilla WoW and you got it. Nostalrius and other private servers with 10k is not how vanilla was, they are bootleg servers made by Bulgarian teenagers. If that's what you are into maybe you should just keep playing on them instead. If they change cap to 5-10k to mimic private servers they could just change respect cost to 5g too right? That ruins the game, not what the community wanted #nochanges
---
And the solution/resolution to 25% of their problems is to make loot final. 
---
The quest stuff is the Ornate Mithril, kinda an odd set with some decent dps pieces with no survivability.
---
Heavy Mitrhil has nice AC and stam but nothing else, and can be learned from a normal trainer.
---
oooh you mean it not being in classic.
---
thats interesting why FFA? never heard that before. seems like an easy way to get ninja looters?
---
I haven't killed the Troll boss in the basement for YEARS.  Thank you for bringing this back.  So many feels
---
Right, but you would end up with intervention regardless of if the option is there. Every player wants the exception.
---
If you had to contact a GM in order to make it happen, no it clearly was **not** a part of the game.
---
And even if that was the case, it was completely pointless as you would just get the item again even if it took a awhile to get it.
---
lol just google vanilla private server it takes like 5 minutes to set up &gt;.&lt; you just install the game and log in what is there to have no idea about
---
Yeah my bad.. sorry! I got the idea now. How about the problem of ninja looting with the excuse of "oops miss clicked sry guys"? Loot trading would prevent that situation **BUT** it really sucks if you group up with some group of friends who abuse the system to have a bigger chance at winning some stuff for their friend and it is really hard to prove them ninjas without screenshots in which case you could not use the official forums because that would be against the "no naming &amp; shaming" -rule so overall this topic is really complicated. 
---
In a closed and tight realm community in the long run these rumours would spread when more and more people see those a-holes abusing the loot system but it would still suck when it happens.
---
&gt; You could log on at ***anytime of the day*** and find a group to run endgame PvE.
---
That's the crux of it.  PServers had global populations, so a cap of 10k spread evenly across all timezones wasn't too horrible.  But for official servers that will be based in timezones like NA-East, the server will see natural fluctuations.  It still isn't hard to find groups at peak times, and the off-hours can be really peaceful times to farm.
---
So youre asking for say a scenario like Lower BRS and Upper BRS where one is obviously a lower level dungeon comparatively? But the dungeon is organized like that pretty much. The first area tends to be level 56-58 and then you end up getting the shadowforge key or whatever its called and can skip right to the bar where it requires a higher level. Putting seperate instances in to split it up just seems like hand holding to me. 
---
but then we are back to the problem of it being possible to ninjaloot in complete secrecy within pugs with loot trading. Nobody would know its happening
---
Son i'm from West Side Tarren Mill.  You don't know how we do it in the streets.
---
You clearly do not get how things affect eachother by saying that, implementing loot trading **will** ruin the games social aspect by a major margin. Having loot be final will **not** impact the game as, like you yourself said. It will only effect a small small number of interactions every once in a blue moon.
---
We can hate on *so, so, so so so much* about retail WoW, but the current art and design teams have hit so many homeruns since Cata that they should retire their jerseys when the game finally closes.
---
\#nochanges sure, but I would have loved to have seen Classic's gameplay through their current vision, even if only dungeon bosses.
---
It was really common to use FFA. It was easier than a raid leader giving the loot to the wrong person, and I can imagine looking through a list of 40 names in BWL was not easy. 
---
 Ninja looting was an immediate gkick, and on a server that was a death sentence for your reputation. It still happenend.
---
A wireless mouse in 2005?  OP is a Timelord.  Next he's gonna show a pic of his flying car.
---
Of course it was. 
---
Contacting GMs to handle stuff that shouldn't happen has is part of the game. If it hadn't been part of the game, it wouldn't have happened. 
---
It's really simple. 
---
Well on our server we didnt have a single guild using FFA loot (as far as I know). what server/region did you play on?
---
Your #nochanges is a meme. There are already plenty of changes coming in Classic. The staged content, starting on 1.12 items/talents, sharding, etc. Having a low population just to match what old servers had doesn't necessarily preserve shit about vanilla. It should be looked at and blizzard should consider what the number of players per server should be. 
---
This needs to be further up. It sort of looks like some people think that OP is making these by hand and it's concerning.
---
Very cool. Thanks for the info
---
This brings me back.
---
I def thought the same thing when I started seeing these posts. At no fault of the op, I’ve seen him give credit and recommend inkarnate, I just think people aren’t quite understanding that the artwork isn’t custom.
---
No SL/SL locks in Vanilla.
---
5000 would be very nice and help the world to feel actually alive. 2.5k is dead af
---
Bags are the best and only thing, you can get weapons from dungeons.
---
I think you've touched on the core of the problem. Yes there are some upsides to loot trading, legitimate mistakes can happen. However in reality those mistakes rarely do happen, and the solution proposed (loot trading) opens up such a massive gaping hole for abuse it's mind-blowing that people are even considering it.
---
I'm for loot trading, yes it has some disadvantages but its such a minescule  thing. 90% of the time its just gonna be annoying for blizz cuz people missclicked on fucking need, or gave ML to the wrong person.
---
And if loot trading is such a huge issue for you guys, because it can be "abused", then just have it only be tradable while still in a dungeon, and viewable when traded over. So you can see it actually being ninja-looted.
---
Lose its value? Aren't the only people who participated in obtaining it the ones who can be traded with?
---
That’s actually a fair point, I do agree. I guess micro transactions have just made me salty. Ever since we got 900 reskinned boats in WoD but were offered unique and new mounts via the cash shop, I’ve never been the same lmao.
---
being 60 is the best thing you can be when trying to level professions, and once you hit 60 you will be in a niche crowd of 60's who will also want to find other 60's asap for dungeoning and getting ahead of the crowd.
---
Lmao what tf are you even talking about
---
A small, hidden tent that was empty at some point, but now contains a hermit and houses a lot of sheep, one of which is mechanical. If you kill that sheep, the hermit gets sad.
---
pvp  rank isnt  going to be in launch.
---
Anyone who expects a war to be in full plate at level 40 is braindead.  RFD is where people go to get plate. Icemetal Barbute is the first thing on most warriors lists when they hit 40.
---
True, true. I mean if you enter the group, you should be locked into the loot rules which means you know what the plan was before you entered a group. The only thing is... Should the loot rules (FFA, Master loot, etc) require a party vote in order to change? This would cut down on people swapping to master loot before a boss is down.
---
Loot goes back (is "traded") to the ML, not some other player.
---
Old ST is still in the game, although you have to use some *clever game mechanics* to back to it. [I made a post a few years ago about accidentally clipping through the floor and just seeing old ST hit me with a wave of nostalgia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddenwow/comments/3k2rca/old_sunken_temple/)
---
Or, hop in vent, mc, as in we gonna do mc. Could be misclick too though
---
&gt; Hell, my real life friend and I plan on rolling for each other in our dungeon runs if they keep loot trading in.
---
There you go. That is the only problem with loot trading so far, people like you and your friend, i'd blacklist you in a second and spread the word.        
---
We don't know the rules of their version of loot trading yet.        
---
How will you trade the items if they get soulbound whenever you press need on something if that's what they go with?
---
2.5k is dead as hell and then during non peak times it will be even worse
---
I need 5k cap for the world to feel alive
---
2500 was a full realm in vanilla
---
Those are very solid points. I actually think the female dwarf casting animations are amazing.
---
Am I the only one who thinks that 18 h/day is unhealty and can be categorized as addiction? 
---
You want to have the same feeling of how vanilla was. That's what Blizzard is trying to give us. Not some recreation of Nostalrius lol. Having 100 people camp devilsaurs in un'goro is not vanilla. Having raids of 200 people roam in BRM is not vanilla. Having 60s roam lvl 20 zones camping lowbies is not vanilla. These are a result of the population from private servers. Respec cost is not irrelevant at all, it's a change private servers made so raiders could go out and PvP in between their raids. Had a huge impact in the open world, just as the 10k pop did.
---
Sorry, Rovell. This was one of my favorites and it introduced me to Muse.
---
Also depends if people are looking for groups in SW / IF general chat or if they're looking in trade chat or a global LFG channel. 
---
Somewhat irrelevant but reminds me of some good ol WLD vs RMP in BC arena. The synergy between these classes respectively was just so much fun. 
---
I was doing it at level 56.
---
Good luck looting that item on every raid member when there's 200 players from both factions stuffed into that tiny hallway murdering each other on release day
---
That will be the time that people use UBRS entrance
---
and it was dead af
---
This has always been a problem. You were more than capable of opening a GM ticket to ask for an item to be transferred because of a mistake--the GMs rarely check the logs, and you can fool them by staging a conversation in whispers where you are told to transfer the item as they forgot you're not eligible or something. You are obviously agreeing, and the GM will never actually check the rolls or argue with you about why you aren't giving it then to the runner-up.
---
Having vanilla populations is a big part of the game though. If half your server is running around in raid gear and you can easily form a group within 10 minutes a lot of things lose meaning and it becomes like retail. Old mmo's had artificial difficulty that made things rarer . Part of that was not being able to quickly find people to do things without forming friendships.  
---
Outside of my guild I can't remember anyone from private servers I grouped with they were as faceless as retails LFG. In vanilla however I forged friendships and rivalries because of the small community. Running into the same names and having to make friends to get things done in the game was an amazing experience.
---
The upcoming Classic Launch will feature way more players starting at the same time than when a new server opened up back then. 
---
Private server baby spotted
---
No shit, 20k+ with dynamic respawns. (blizzlike 1x rate on vanilla is literally 15 fucking minutes on world quest objects, it will be changed anyways). up to 10-15k concurrent players (so you don't have to spend 5 hours looking for dungeons AND there are multiple raiding guilds per server, instead of just 1-2).
---
Vanilla is the ONLY version of WoW that works with a high pop because of how the players are so scattered around in different zones based on faction and level (in Outland, Northrend etc. where EVERYONE on your lvl will always be in the same zone regardless of faction). Alliance usually have EK supremacy, and Horde Kalimdor. They will quest in different areas, farm in different places and mostly only collide in hotspots like blackrock mountain.
---
People who say they want 2k pop or retail blizzlike are honestly delusional, and didn't play the game for over a fucking decade. And if they get their will they will learn from J. Allen Brack (who was right about some of the bad aspects of vanilla) that playing a MMORPG without QoL changes is awful with a low pop.
---
The private server scene has already concluded with high pop servers being superior, because it makes the game more playable, more alive at every stage (even after everyone has hit 60, you can still do all group quests in every zone, because they are populated) and there will be people available for every progression tier.
---
I hope they do both servers (Huge which is the most playable version) and hipster server (2-4k cap)
---
Not an assholish response! Was under the impression they were created from scratch lol. Thanks for the info 
---
I don't think it will feel "dead as hell" when servers are region restricted. Obviously bots and non-region players will slip in, but pserver numbers are extremely misleading insofar as a large portion of players are very sharply divided by the language barrier and don't interact outside economically in the auction house. To be fair, at "off-hours" for your region the server will definitely be dead as opposed to somewhat offset by timezones 7-9 hours ahead or behind you with some common language. But 9k active on a pserver might still equate to 2k-4k active and interactable with.
---
But the legitimate mistakes are not the only problem as I said many ninjas will use the excuse of missclicking and in that case it is hard to separate it from an actual mistake and ninja-ing. 
---
So it is pretty much the risk of a random ninja "miss clicking" versus the risk of getting into a premade buddy group. Buddy groups are easier to avoid (as long as they are in the same guild) but both are really annoying problems. I'm personally fine with both solutions because there really is no perfect solution for this.
---
The best part of Classic is the community atmosphere, not the loot. mistakes happen and you move on. retail is hated by so many because Blizz tried to make it "the perfect MMORPG" imo. Loot sharing SHOULD NOT be in classic.
---
baby? I mean I've actually played the game that we are here to discuss recently unlike you
---
Didn't cloth etc. (Common loot) fall under the group loot/round robin (unsure exactly what the difference was)? 
---
It makes it practically personal loot, so how can someone ninja it?
---
Will anyone ever use FFA in a PUG?
---
Cope. 
---
Wonderbread?
---
Except that it's BIS for the majority of the duration of Vanilla
---
The bigger the paywall, the better!  Paywall &gt; Sharding. *braces for downvotes*
---
Vanilla itemization is really weird - for instance, paladins use a pair of green bracers until C'Thun. You'll hardly ever come across a situation where the best items for each slot all come from the latest raid until you get into Naxxramas. 
---
It's weird, but it also gives you a reason to run earlier raid tiers.
---
&gt; You can't just move 1 point from endurance to Riposte since you need 5/5 deflection.
---
you move 1 from Aggr
---
remove 1 Endur for 1 riposte
---
then put back 1 where it was in Aggr
---
US alliance Blackwing Lair. You never saw any guilds with it? I'm surprised.
---
I don't care.  It's Blizz decision.  I just like watching everyone cry like little babies about it lol.
---
Use me as your "absolutely no sharding" vote
---
I encourage you to try out the tool OP used to make them, I'd like to see more inkarnate wow maps.
---
https://inkarnate.com
---
\^this. Retail WoW mindset is the downfall of Vanilla. CLASSIC WILL NOT BE RETAIL. IF THAT ISNT FOR YOU DONT PLAY IT.
---
"Having groups of 60s roam lvl 20 zones camping lowbies is not vanilla."
---
O boy, someone didn't play much vanilla.
---
Nobody on private servers brings 100 people to camp devilsaurs. That isn't effective economically at all. 
---
I have never once seen a 200 person raid in BRM on private server or not. 
---
You are overexaggerating these things in order to make my argument sounds absurd. AKA Strawman. 
---
But sure, your point is taken. I am simply saying that I think pop count should be looked at. I am not saying take the pop to Nostalrius levels. But to have a healthy community where it doesn't take 2 hours to get a PuG for literally anything, I would say more than 2.5k would be good. I don't think bumping that up a bit will drastically change the "vanilla feels".
---
They would have unlimited mana, use heals, pop into bear, your mana regen is high as resto and the other resto isnt outdmging your heals, at least not quickly, and you can innervate for a new mana pool every 5-8 minutes or so.
---
Level a hunter to farm with.
---
Good catch! They allow commercial use with any of the paid plans
---
What? Is that true?
---
I don't want to save playtime, i want to play the fuck out from the Classic. 
---
Blizz hasnt made a decision.  You keep saying it and youre wrong.  We arent crying like babies.  We are telling a company what we want in a game.  So far it seems that company is listening.  
---
If they don't do it, you could always make your own attempt at it with the tool OP used.
---
 https://inkarnate.com
---
I'd like to see more and more people make more wow maps.
---
I love his lists. Such clean and informative spreadsheets.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#
---
you could use both mining and herb with a macro that rotates both trackers
---
but there may be some good value in skinning if you plan to aoe beast camps
---
Again, not saying it needs to be 10k players active at any time. I understand your purist ideal, but I think that going from 2.5k -&gt; 4-5K players is really not going to "ruin the game" so to speak. I think a ton of people agree with me as well. 
---
I know plenty of people on private servers who still have friends beyond their guild. But your mileage may vary. 
---
All loot should be final period. Better pay attention! 
---
Woohoo!  An early countdown episode and great classic news!  Totally stoked!  Thanks Josh. 
---
Social pressures solve the ninja "misclick" problem very well.
---
Social pressures cannot solve the trading collusion problem.
---
you just hate the idea that people will get to 60 before you lol
---
Not even close to true. GM's would move loot around, it just took a couple days. As long as both people were in the group and the person with the loot says the other person should have gotten it they had no issue doing so even if they were not second on the roll. It is a much higher percentage than you give credit for, just invisible since the GM's and the two people involved were the only ones who saw it.
---
Occasionally there was one or two lvl 60s that would come to redridge. It's not like now where you have 5-10 people standing there 24/7. And about BRM, you haven't? Here you go [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g2TQRLA478](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g2TQRLA478) there are tons of clips like this. And this is what un'goro looks like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03VOWKmcgzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03VOWKmcgzo) lol bye
---
God just watch the video.  They're reasoning is sound from their perspective as a business.  They're downsizing their CS base.  They're not going to spend time on loot tickets.  Get a clue
---
Nice work. Proved OP wrong. Take it out of the 5 and 10 mans and leave it in raids where it should be for mistakes.
---
Thanks! I’ll figure out a route and see how many beast camps there are/ if it’s worth it.
---
maybe
---
but what one saw on pservers with 4 times that is also too much
---
a sweet spot would be ~3.5-4k imo
---
Skinning will get more money early when no one is buying mats for professions. Vendoring the leather will get gold faster, but saving the ore and herbs to sell later will be better in time.
---
Unless this is about banking mats for later professions.
---
Once again, who gives a shit?
---
You guys are being weird gatekeepers. None of what you said matters to me at all to be honest. There's such thing as private servers where you could experience these things, not to mention website after website after website of data you can pour over. 
---
You say he's talking about sometning he has no clue about, yet I can tell you as a vanilla player he does know what he's talking about. He's obviously done his research or played a bunch of private servers.
---
I don't really watch his videos TBH, I see him on classiccast that's about it. I don't go around bashing people for trying to do their own hustle and make some money though. Big deal, wow he's motivated... the horror. 
---
This applies to the entirety of retail.
---
&gt; ...the best first character to main?
---
Honestly, the best first main IMO is something you purely enjoy playing.  Doing what you think you *"should"* instead of what you actually want is a fantastic way to burn yourself out.
---
No you don't understand. you need 5/5 deflection to put a point into riposte.
---
This is what a lot of bad players say.  Warlocks are literally the easiest lulul omegalul.  Warlocks are the absolute easiest 1v1 for a holy paladin and your talking trash haha
---
gathering means going out of your way to pick them up cuz often the mobs wont be around the same area
---
with skinning you dont put in extra effort
---
Ret as in Auto Attack Simulator?
---
Was loot trading permitted in Classic? Did it show up in a later patch towards the end of Classic? 
---
I'm sorry, but I have to be *that guy*... I played Classic, but can't remember much about the loot dynamics, aside from angry memories of having someone ninja loot need off me. So I might be way off the mark.
---
If there's no loot trading, how do we avoid ninja looters who take our much-needed upgrades? We just... deal with it? Or are you guys looking for an actual change to the system that originally existed?
---
Not really, strong dots that don't crit means locks can stack spell damage instead and not be reliant on crits to win.
---
I don’t know if this was already addressed or not but will we be able to create horde and alliance characters on the same server?
---
What?
---
Yea nobody is denying the starting zones are going to be flooded, that's just an experience some people WANT since it will be a one time only thing. Now, I'm not one of the people that want that experience, it's insane to me how incredibly frustrating and maddening it would be to try and fight 100 people for a mob that spawns every 30 seconds. 
---
Thankfully I'm very confident the majority of people do not want to experience that kind of launch either, the bigger concern I keep hearing is that people are worried that if Blizzard uses sharding once they won't stop using. I kind of understand that fear but it's sort of silly to me because if you think about it using sharding virtually anywhere else at any other time doesn't make sense. There's no other time large groups of players are forced into a select few areas to fight over mobs. It doesn't even make sense for the gate opening because the whole idea is to have large groups of players fighting AQ monsters together as raids of players (vs individual or small groups fighting for mobs in the starter zones).
---
I did this on my priest in burning crusaded, yes i know this is classic talk, but i walked them off the edge of the world. I had three players hunt me down for a bit so i just shadowmelded and then hearthed.
---
No dme at launch so nope. Aoe in open world is a great way to get ganked.
---
Honestly I don't know why but Blackrock Depths felt so much... I don't know, better, than Sunken Temple.
---
Sunken Temple felt nearly as long but Blackrock Depths somehow in my mind was fun while ST felt like a real chore tbh. I'm really not sure why. I think it might have just been a matter of liking the theme better. 
---
Well I saved all my days off from work for the release of WoW classic. I watch every Youtube videos about the class I wanna play (warrior). I made a printable version of the famous Joana's leveling guide. I'm making spreadsheet with all the pre-raid BIS items and my leveling talents. I'm writing guides for the few friends that will join me on this adventure. I'm lurking in this subreddit ofc :D  I'm a big fan of minipets (like cats, birds, etc.) that you could summon in WoW vanilla, so soon I'll make a guide to collect them all :D 
---
Ungoro : I see 32 people in a raid group. Not 100. Yes this happened occasionally. Honestly, if cross faction collusion is allowed, it will happen in Classic too. Even if you shrink the population. Cross faction collusion being bannable is what is going to prevent this if anything.   
---
BRM:  That is one video of 40 ppl vs 150. That is a once in a server fight since they all popped light of elune. Not 200.   
---
Again, I am not saying to go to a 10-15k population like old private servers. I am saying there is a happy middle ground.   
---
Again, I am saying you are overexaggerating these things in order to make my argument sound absurd. 
---
I am here to have  a discussion about it. You are just being a toxic flamer. 
---
I was just about to make the same suggestion! great idea
---
&gt;can easily form a group within 10 minutes a lot of things lose meaning and it becomes like retail. 
---
You can form a group quickly (which is a good thing, less downtime) but there are no summoning stones, so unless you have a warlock you have to spend 10-30 min dragging your ass across the continents to reach whatever instance you are doing. So does your entire group as well.
---
&gt;Outside of my guild I can't remember anyone from private servers I grouped with they were as faceless as retails LFG. 
---
Yeah, I felt the same to a point. But I actually made it past RFC tho.
---
&gt;. Running into the same names and having to make friends to get things done in the game was an amazing experience.
---
And you will, because people separate themselves from the herd all the time.
---
Well I enjoy every class to be honest, and since it’s classic all over again I want a fresh start. I also want to make sure I get gold and since I plan on making every class, I want my first toon to be a good provider of gold and be efficient at leveling. 
---
To play devil's advocate, they're the best memories, but it's often best that they stay memories. ;)
---
Lol that's true but in a Naxx raid I've seen horde use a flask of petrification for that.
---
well I didn't only raid with one guild. but true, it's possible that some (even the majority) of our servers raidguilds used FFA.
---
It could also be possible that somebody started a trend with the first raid on the server, decided something, and that decision propagated through the server raiding population. who knows :D
---
Dme?
---
Making loot unfixable is the change, what are you missing? They always fixed loot, you have 14 years now of them fixing loot and quite a number of years where they put it in the hands of players without any real issues. Changing that now would be a huge divergence, and they would still be handling tons of tickets about it. Instead they are going with the new system to avoid GM's dealing with those tickets.
---
Good post, but I disagree with your assent that the waiting portion of Ret makes it noobish. You have a few very strong cool downs that still function on the time scale of a duel (BoP, HoJ, Repentance). Understanding the matchup to the point that you know when to optimally use them is a skill.
---
I can see where mage/rogue players aren't happy playing ret since it is more of a reactive play style, but that doesn't make it bad or noobish.
---
I don’t think you read the convo, he said stun resistances. I was saying the warlock would hope that he is able to resist the rogues stuns. Nothing to do with warlocks spells lol
---
is the calculator outdated or what?
---
I swear I see the green dragon eye on the ui, that was added in BC. So it would not be december 2005 🤔
---
Also playing with other people/guildies tends to make folks play more. Back in retail me and my friends rerolled on a fresh realm together and we basically nolifed it just so we could keep up with eachanother. Then you have all the hype from pservers and the demo and such ramping up everyone's desire to 'go hard' - there's more hype for Vanilla currently than there was on retail launch.
---
Thanks for taking the time to answer.
---
The mystery yeah that's totally gone. But the artificial difficulty can still be there because a lot of it has to do solely with population. We knew the boss encounters back in the day unless you were the first guilds to get there. We knew what the best gear for the raids were unless you're talking like the very start of vanilla.   
---
 I'm not saying things to do with your reputation completely disappeared by any means but they are certain vastly diminished by having a non vanilla population. 
---
don't think it's outdated. just wrong.
---
Then you clearly did not play vanilla.
---
There were ALWAYS horde guilds camping redridge. Maybe you didn't play on a PvP server. There was ALWAYS a guild called "Redridge Warriors" or something doing the same shit they do on private servers now. Some servers will be different, but this was my experience.
---
&gt; but I'm not worried about 2500-3000 pop
---
It hurts progression, and especally in vanilla where are too much content that you can't do alone. Lot of classes can't even fucking farm without respeccing, questing can be real aids as there a fucktong of elite quests, so you always want to have a lot of people to play with.
---
With higher pop you get more people in each progression tier, so content becomes more accessible and less of a slug fest. Keep in mind that battlegrounds won't be cross-realm, there are no summoning stones (there are but they aren't "summoning" stones) so having a higher pop just tackles the most tedious aspect of vanilla which is the downtime where you can end up not being able to do anything.
---
There is so much group content, and you will find out once it released and be glad you picked the highest pop server available.
---
Do both. I’m going to re-live my vanilla WoW experience by re-creating my main, but I’m also going to make an opposing faction alt for a completely new experience.
---
Oh, you're one of those neckbeard/incel-type guys. Nevermind.
---
 what about sharding and all the other shit have they addressed that by any chance ?
---
Loot Trading in Raids Only.
---
Learning a starting zone on your own is one of the coolest experiences.  Dive in my friend, you will be fine!
---
Or... they can take the data from the private servers which have been doing vanilla for years and follow their conclusions to make vanilla into the best experience possible.
---
That’s assuming the quest isn’t active beforehand and you can get attuned at launch even if you can’t access the instance.  Can’t say for sure if Blackhand’s Command will still be in that mobs loot table until content bucket whatever.
---
You pigheadedly denying it is just as data-less as him.
---
Dire Maul East.  It's the instance where mages solo AoE grind.
---
:) it was lit friend! Did you play alliance? I was in &lt;Blacklisted&gt;
---
I think early tailoring will be profitable for bags. And you can probably do "will make you bag x with your mats plus tip" and people will pay you to help level your tailoring to an extent because bags are early probably the most important thing in the game. you can always swap later but..... just my thoughts on it.
---
Increasing the player cap requires things like dynamic spawning or speeding up spawntimers. The game wasn't made for more players.
---
How groups from on current private servers doesn't feel like vanilla at all and is closer to lfg. There has been very rarely someone that I remembered.
---
I want the player caps from back then because it honestly just felt best to me.
---
I agree with you. I just think that the situation is different now than when Vanilla first came out. Before, you make the server 2500 people, and it actually would fill and stay relatively stable. Now you are going to make it 2500, and half of them are going to go back to BFA when they get bored, killing server pops. I bet if you made it 5k then it would feel more like actual Vanilla than 2.5k would. 
---
Too many and you run into issues with farming, quest spawns, etc. Too few and you run into problems with filling groups. Solutions that have been tried are sharding (on retail,) or dynamic spawns (pserver.)
---
The other thing about pservers like Nostalrius is that they serve a worldwide player base with activity at all hours.
---
Retail servers are much more likely to be regional. Want to find groups? Choose a server that has a lot of players who are on at the same time as you usually play. Want to farm? Find an off-peak time that works for you.
---
Assuming sharding or dynamic spawns will not be present, the problem is finding a population that works for a regional server. 
---
The starting zones are designed for people with zero knowledge of the game. You’ll be fine. 
---
As far as being a NE Shadow Priest. Always be on the lookout for nice hiding places near cliffs and long falls :)
---
RNG was definitely an Orcs best friend, but just a general comment that warlocks are actually pretty nice for being RNG immune
---
Ah, but what about levels 20-40? It must be efficient still? Plus I thought there are several grind spots in the 40s like in tanaris that are super good?
---
Where is the game?
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
I have fond memories of the people I used to see inside Orgrimmar every day, and with a server population of 10k like Nostalrius had, I highly doubt it would feel like «Vanilla», which is exactly what they are trying to re-create.
---
Is your concern with shadow priests or with the night elf starting area?  They aren't really related.
---
If you don't know the starting area you can either A.) be surprised, B.) look at guides (or use an a quest addon if available), C.) play it now on a pserver, or D.) find a friend to group with through that area and do the quests together who may know the area.
---
If your concern is with shadow priesting on a night elf, what is your concern?  The general consensus is that SPriests aren't amazing and you generally wont bring more than 1 to a raid, if you bring 1.  They are strong in PVP and soloing / leveling.  Though they may be stronger disc prior to level 40.  
---
As for being a night elf priest, you will see pro and cons for it all over this sub.  They don't bring a ton of extra to a raid (like fear ward from dwarves, or the human +5% spirit / rep).  and their abilities like starshards and the dodge buff are seen as "meh" at best.  But a lot of people look forward to PVPing with a NESP because of mind control from shadow meld and just based on looks.
---
What are your end goals as a player for this character? you wanting to pvp, raid hard core, casual raid, just 5 mans, etc?
---
Doing the hunter epic quest.
---
And enchanting to supplement? Or skinning for fast gold overtime 
---
I as a night elf priest, my second big level toon, was leveling holy on a pvp server. I would buff the horde when i saw them.
---
Now i did this with mind control and then fort buff on them and it worked. They would thank me and not kill me even if they killed others they would leave me alone when they found me.
---
Once i was walking throught an area and a group of horde was there. many waved at me and one killed me. I guess his guild really yelled at him about doing that because im the nice priest that is off limits to them.
---
A more minor things but still &gt;&lt;
---
Another minor thing was i had enchanting higher than i should have due to being supplied by my main de stuff and i asked a warlock in silithus to summon me and he said sure if i can get the others to help so i said sure. next thing i knew i was invited to the group and summoned.
---
I suppose most warlocks, myself included as that was my main, were used to people going no you find them you're already there or the like.
---
i think the first fits this topic more but...... still.
---
Or you could just have 10 people clear UBRS while the other 30 wait dead outside until they can rez and instantly zone in, avoiding the world PVP clusterfuck entirely.
---
This is what any reasonable raid guild will do because competing for access to that single rare spawn mob is not feasible
---
Just play the game. 
---
Please don't ruin the experience of doing something for the first time by watching videos and making yourself jaded before even seeing the content. The best thing about the game is experiencing stuff first-hand and learning things as you go.
---
Nostalrius was an international server. That made it easier to find people at all times. 5,000 pop cap will seem like a ghost town. I think 7-8,000 would provide a better economy, playerbase, without being packed like a slave ship.
---
Spec 20/0/31 and do both. 
---
Best tip for new priests: keep your wand up to date. You can get a level 5 one from enchanters or the AH.
---
The starting zone isnt anything to worry about, except that you are really far from the other starting zones.
---
Sharding is good when used sparsely in the 1-10 range to keep the starter zone manageable. There's not going to be anywhere near as many servers as there was in vanilla, and that's the way to best handle it without harming the "classic experience" in any conceivably rational way.
---
Agreed. I'll take a game where mistakes happen over a game with loot trading.
---
So it will take you around 8 days or 192h to reach 60. You can easy farm 40-50g/h on a paladin so in that time you can earn almost 10,000 gold.
---
So to answer your question.
---
Nah
---
I played both original vanilla and on a private server recently. I know what 2.5k feels like. I know what 5k feels like. I want my MMORPG to feel Massively Multiplayer. I want a 5k cap.
---
You're pretty fast when it's about denouncing my opinions or degrading them. Kinda annoying tbh in the long run.
---
All I'm saying is that the gameplay is dull in PvE unless we talk about naxx, the classes are unfinished and unbalanced, some specs lack purpose.
---
And those are not the things that mack vanilla tick, at least not for me. I don't go full nostalgia mode when seeing a raid stacked with mages / rogues / warriors.
---
And I don't get nostalgia and a warm fuzzy feeling when I force myself awake with my hardcore frostbolt spam rotation in MC.
---
For me, classic is about community (and this sub makes me shiver thinking about summer), slow and steady progression, the feeling of gear is still worth something. You're not replacing everything every week, gamble your way up with titanforges and such. Time spent feels more rewarding.
---
It's also more RPG, ammo, soulstones, feeding pets, crafting that matters, weapon skills, going to the trainer and learning new skills, a more flexible talent tree, dedicated gear with resistances are coming to my mind.
---
But nothing I've mentioned conflicts with the idea of balancing the game. I want elemental shamans to have a purpose, same goes for oomkins, who can't even do their damage which is inferior without downranking to be even worse.
---
There is also no reason for a raid like MC to exist in it's old form, with single mechanic bosses.
---
I'm just saying, balance the classes and present the players with a challenge. Many are 14 years richer in experience. It's not the first raid we will do in our lives.
---
And I write that, very well aware that they won't change anything.
---
But for my taste, people are accepting or even praising miscalculations on blizzards part from back in the day, and that kinda bothers me.
---
I'm not saying I want homogenized classes, LFR, flying mounts and mythic+, alongside titanforges and so on.
---
Anyway, I'd really appreciate if you'd drop that attitude in the future, it makes discussing a chore.
---
Have a good day though.
---
You're confusing sharding with cross-realm. Sharding is the same server, but it's broken into invisible channels. You and your friend could be on the same server, but not be on the same channel so you won't see each other. Until you invite him to a party, you won't be able to see him. You can't force yourself onto a different channel, as they only open up as one channel overflows. The AH across all these "channels" would be the same, it's solely to reduce overcrowding of high population zones. 
---
I would say either one. skinning is what you find is most needed beyond cloth but enchanting makes use of a lot of the stuff you make multiples of.
---
Blizzard following "the data" and trying to make their game "the best experience possible" is literally how we ended up with retail.
---
OMG that'd be a GREAT feral tauren druid name. 
---
If all you want for classic is to be like private servers then why even bother. They work perfectly fine for what they aim to be.
---
I also think that with everyone knowing what loot they need people will be less willing to just do certain instances to check them out which will make getting a group harder.
---
Just don't make the item changes retroactive. They typically did that so it would change broken item that got nerfed, there's no harm in letting people keep old, weaker versions of items once a change goes live. This way it's basically just like time-gating items
---
Seems it would cost them money taking out a system that exists in the base version of the game they are building classic on. That's dev time wasted.
---
Finally getting enough gold to buy my first mount. 60% riding speed felt like 600%. 
---
Incorrect, a free action potion will stop stuns, not break them. A living action position, which the recipe comes with ZG release, breaks a current stun. Gotta pay to play.
---
There are, but given that it's a new server with lots of people it may be hard to find a place to AoE grind or you may have to AoE grind on off hours.
---
&gt;The mystery yeah that's totally gone.
---
You are completely right about that, and min-maxing will be the thing (whether you like or not). People will do the instances they need shit from, and then never go back there. (all melee will farm BRD for instance, and not completely disregard DMW etc.) because they know all the dungeons, bosses and drops. People don't go random instance for no reason.  Which is also why you need a higher pop to support all the progression tiers so you always have someone who needs stuff from every instance, as oppose to 200 rogues who have the item and will never do X instance again.
---
I like your hunters name :)
---
Have you got any examples of this happening?
---
They were in Durotar
---
Dungeon XP is awful compared to questing.
---
During the first few months of launch you won't find a place where you can AoE grind. It will be hard enough just to tag mobs.
---
Showtooltip wasn't in Vanilla.  
---
We'll see what's in Classic.
---
Masterloot misclick. Happens all the time, and with the number of players and raids it could be hundreds of times per day in classic.
---
Need roll misclick, happens even more often when you kill something and 4 things pop up on screen. That priest doesn't need the warrior's shield drop but he needed because it was in the same spot on screen as that other guy he was trying to loot. Trade fixes that immediately, GM takes a few days but will fix it (Except they don't want to pay GM's to deal with this), no loot fix creates anger from several people. 
---
Complain all you like because you were lucky, but these things happened all the time, and clearly blizz thinks it will happen enough based on info they have that they need a solution.
---
J. Allen Brack was 100% correct as far as I am concerned, if the server pop isn't high enough to support a significant amount of players on EVERY progression tier. (which means lvling in every zone, and gear progression at 60).
---
They fucked retail real bad, didn't have the pop to support multiple progression tiers and thats why we ended up with patch-patch progression and constant catch-up mechanics.
---
It will happen to vanilla as well if they are going with the hipster 2k pop (which will be awful, unless you are playing from day one with the herd).
---
I don't remember lack of people to been problem during vanilla. On EU servers most people would play at same time as you. Our server (Stormreaver) had pretty active population with several large guilds.
---
0 chance you get it. 
---
Enjoy your pservers. 
---
Group up before going into the Ban'ethil Barrow Dens.
---
Trust me.
---
Classic Community: Blizzard listened to the playerbase crying and ruined the game.
---
Also Classic Community: Blizzard should listen to us crying.
---
&gt; and the off-hours can be really peaceful times to farm.
---
No-one cares
---
Influencers are literally destroying video games right now by giving developers a pass for anti-consumer practices. You can't just say don't watch him when people are expressing legitimate concerns about having someone like TipsOut be one of the faces of Classic WoW.
---
these remind me of the original deer hunter pc games. good job
---
The lower population there is on a realm the higher value your friends list have.
---
I don't give a fuck what "nowaday players" want. There is the whole retail version of what "nowaday players" want and it's disgusting. No offence.
---
I'd go herbing/skinning.  Skinning because you will be mowing down beasts.  Herbing because you can pick an herb node clean faster than you can mine, which means you can abuse frost nova for herbing a lot easier than mining.
---
This sub is hilarious. Full of people that don't even know the product they are zealously advocating for. When people with recent experience enter the discussion, they get shit on.
---
a better site https://www.dkpminus.com/vanilla-wow-talent-calculator/index.html?talent=11215875_4
---
&gt; Keep in mind that battlegrounds won't be cross-realm 
---
Is there a official source for this? Cross Realm Battelgrounds were a thing in Vanilla...
---
Also there is never a moment where most players have "nothing" to do, before you have all prof recipe's, all reps grinded out and stuff like that there is always something to do that you can do solo. Heck, you can alway's go fishing for your of your guilds food buffs if you have spare time :P 
---
1. Warrior.
---
2. Paladins are welcomed regardless of race. Your utility is amazing and not race reliant like a priest is. If you like Dwarf, play Dwarf!
---
3. Every class has their own gold sinks, but as a Paladin, your’s are relatively minor in comparison.
---
this made me think of how some people were confused why vc stood for deadmines instead of dm &gt;&lt;
---
Okay. I want priests to have a fourth spec that can tank. That doesn't mean that it's something classic needs.
---
I agree with that and we had that to an back in the day like casters not wanting to do SM armory. The thing is with a lower population people are forced to cooperate or they get nothing done. Don't want to do Sm armory for you tank as a mage ? Guess what hes not going to tank cathedral or library for you so you're forced to help each other out.  
---
Although for most people instead of seeing it as being forced by another player its forced by the game. One of the nicest communities I've ever been a part of was everquest. Some dude would legit take an hour out of his time to come resurrect you for free because he knew how grueling the game was if you lost all those hours of experience. That level of being nice was alot more common back then compared to modern communities. It wasn't because the people were just nicer or better human beings it's just because the environment nurtured empathy and sympathy. That's not to say there weren't plenty of assholes cause there always will be.  
---
When the environment is a pain in the ass it forges meaningful friendships and forces us to work together to get things done. That's what made those old mmo's special.
---
Been thinking about this, and it wouldn't be a suprise to me if actibliz forced some kind of "micro"transaction like tokens. It would 100% ruin the endgame prestige though.
---
George w is junior. H. W. Is senior 
---
Fortunate Son.
---
Nah man that's just Northshire.
---
Theyre advocating for vanilla.. Which was 2.5k concurrent.  You want to play a different game.  Pservers compensate for higher caps with altered spawn and drop rates. 
---
Was about to say, Cross-Realm BGs were a thing in Vanilla and I don't see why it wouldn't be a thing in the remake
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum
---
I'm going to remake my first toon ever, a human warlock named koala. I am also gonna try horde, but unsure what one. maybe a troll pally.
---
joking i know they can't be pallys even now &gt;&lt;

no as the title says we will be on a pvp server

---
Not really, a good warlock just drains your mana, locks you out of holy spells with Felhunter and Curse of Tongues, and kills you. 
---
I'm in a similar situation. Guildies from 13 years ago contacted me about the Discord they got going. We managed to reach out and get in contact with a large chunk of the old core raiders with about 10%-20% that are actually interested. 
---
A handful of us decided to join a Pserver to check it out repping the old guild name only to find around 10 people that recognized us from the guild name from 13 years ago ( even some from the other faction). They quickly got on their alt to chat with us to find out what are plans are for classic. 
---
The majority of those that said they were interested in classic refused to join a Pserver in fear of geting banned or something. Obviously we couldn't force them to try it out but we'll see when classic comes out. Im sure they might play for a while and end up dropping out but that's okay because we met some new faces on the private server and are interested in joining us in classic.
---
Vanilla already was the best "Vanilla WoW" experience possible imho. No pserver has ever topped that for me. 
---
Also realm caps were in WoW for a reason. As studd like spawntimes, herb / mining nodes and baislcy the whole economy was balanced around that player cap. Changing the player cap would also force a lot of other changes to the game. 
---
I picked up the attitude because I tried to defend your posts and you came back at me with "you just don't get my point." Apparently I've misread the tone of the conversation, and apologize for the antagonistic tact I took at the end, but also you did contribute to the negative tone as well. Dangers of text conversations I suppose.
---
I do agree with much of what you just said about the spirit of vanilla, but I also think that many of your thoughts and suggestions run opposite to the values you've just enumerated. Ultimately this is a conversation that is spread all over the place and frankly exhausting to have in this medium, so probably best to drop it.
---
A very nice day to you as well.
---
The companion codex website is down, so I used the wayback machine to create a png of all the pet families in classic. I'll probably use this when playing, and wanted to share in case anyone else found it useful.

There doesn't need to be an expensive fix here.  Broadcast a message like the following to everyone in the party, and the community can sort it all out:
---
Gnomage has traded Briarwood Reed to Dippindots.
---
You know, after playing on a server with 120peak population, anything above that already feels like an overwhelming number
---
What do you mean everyone got super excited over maps?
---
Yeah, was a written mistake, I just meant normal SL lock. Still, the arguments was made from a vanilla SL lock standpoint, just used to writing SL/SL lock more lately.
---
You be a real shadow priest until level 40 anyways
---
&gt; You want to play a different game.
---
The same game with more players in the world is not a different game.
---
&gt; Pservers compensate for higher caps with altered spawn and drop rates.
---
Some do, some don't. Mine didn't.
---
And you just enjoy collecting downvotes, don't you?
---
You're pretty ignorant if you think you're gonna have the same kind of connections like you did 14 years ago . People aren't the same as they were back then everyone's pretty toxic now
---
Well there’s still The BRD farm.
---
Your idea sounds equally absurd to me. My post just tried to show you how I feel about your proposal to change player caps because it's what you want.
---
No loot trading.   No sharding.
---
"sheer size of the playerbase"
---
I don't see Classic having more than 500k players, once the initial rush dies down.
---
I'm planning to play druid, and while leveling (feral) I won't learn starfire and other spells I probably wouldn't use. I will most likely buy them at top level when I have to money to spare, but I would rather have a mount at 40 (even though I have cheetah at 30). And also more money to spare at 60.
---
1. If you want your paladin leveling to be interesting, you can do something like 11/34/5 for Consecration, Benediction, and mainly Prot talents for AoE farming, which is not as good as private server Reckbombing but still okay, or you can just go for Seal of Command and Pursuit of Justice to level normally, which will involve lots of autoattacks but you have actual weaving of spells and autoattacks which is mechanically interesting and a bit of nice class fantasy, imo. Kargoz's Paladin Leveling guide breaks down the talents and rotation nicely.
---
2. Race is kinda negligible for Paladin with just little differences here and there. Play whichever makes you happy.
---
3. If you are playing Holy in endgame PvE, you wear a lot of cloth and only have a middling number of consumables, so no it won't be especially expensive as your repair bills won't be insane and you don't have too much to purchase there. On the PvP side, you'll always have your Engineering upkeep and stuff, but that's not exclusive to a paladin, either.
---
The idea probably comes from private servers not having them so it's ridiculous that classic would have them.
---
I like it!  Do you have it without the grid lines?
---
Not all of us, there will be enough fine people and  OP will experience his community feel again.  It will be different from 2005, but still have the same basic feel. 
---
5K cap, done. 
---
? Why would you need dire maul for unarmored epic mounts that come from a vendor? Seems like you're thinking of pallys
---
&gt;\[...\] as you claim *we* are the ones drawing "drastic conclusions". 
---
What I wrote was:
---
&gt; But the arguments I see people bring up lead to far more drastic  conclusions than people are willing to draw, which makes them seem  hypocritical. 
---
Now, let me walk you through that sentence, because it does not look like you have understood it the first time around. 
---
With "people", I refer to those who argue that loot trading will lead to toxicity/abuse, as is apparent from the context. 
---
No other person is brought up that "people" might refer to. That means that "people" refers to the same people in both cases (Namely "We" in your terms). You got that much right. 
---
The arguments "people" bring up logically "lead" to drastic conclusions, as was elaborated in my post. These conclusions are "more drastic" than "people" are willing to draw. That means that "people" are not, in fact, drawing drastic conclusions. They are unwilling to. This is what you failed to understand. 
---
As for niché situations: I doubt BoP trading abuse is going to be more common than BoE or unbound drops. Arguing value doesn't change the quality of the act, it's only trying to relativize it. As such, you haven't brought up any argument against my point and there's nothing to discuss. 
---
That aside: If, with your last sentence, you wish to insinuate I am making excuses for anything: I am not. I don't care if loot trading is in, if BoEs are in or whatever. I'm just calling out double standards. 
---
All that said - You have failed to understand my posts twice in a row now, which, with all due respect, leads me to think discussing things further with you is futile. Speak your peace in a final reply if you wish and have a good day. 
---
A lot. The community I promise you wont be the same as it was in 2004.
---
Original player caps were fine, the World always felt alive, and more important, authentic. Farm spots werent overfarmed 24/7, herb / mining nodes werent generally camped. You could actually find a devilsaur if you wanted to find one. There was always something to do .
---
And yes player caps do preserve Vanilla, as Blizzard (or Ex Blizzard) employees already have stated, the whole economy was balanced around the caps. This is probably why every pserver on the block has a f'ed up economy. 
---
The original player cap was concurrent, so their could be 10k players on a server, but only around 2.5k could be logged on at the same time.  
---
Have you played on a private server recently? Do you know what 5k players online feels like? Have you played vanilla at all since 2007? Or are you basing your opinion on 10 year old memories?
---
Your pretty ignorant if you think people weren’t toxic 14 years ago.
---
If PvE server? Definitely.
---
PvP server? Probably not, they haven't commented on it.
---
Why not just play on a private server? No need to put yourself through retail
---
Wanna cross streams, bruh?
---
For real! I was in Blacklisted too. Played a Human Mage (Baeby was my char name iirc, lol). 
---
Yep, I remember playing WoW on Christmas eve 2007 just a few days after I bought it, leveling my Mage in Westfall.
---
&gt;Is there a official source for this? Cross Realm Battelgrounds were a thing in Vanilla...
---
I might be wrong, but I don't think they were when they were added, and you had to go to ashenvale to queue WSG etc. I thought they weren't.
---
&gt;Also there is never a moment where most players have "nothing" to do, before you have all prof recipe's, all reps grinded out and stuff like that there is always something to do that you can do solo. Heck, you can alway's go fishing for your of your guilds food buffs if you have spare time :P
---
There is something you can do, but a lot of the content is group-centered, and tank/healers doesn't grind well unless they have alternate gear-set ups which is still quite shitty.
---
But dungeon grinding is usually what you want to do for your progress as a lot of items have +"random stats" (kinda like titanforging) where you can have random lvl 52-60 gear blues that have the potential of having sick stats. So always a lot of min-maxing based on group content.
---
&gt;Sharding is good

As much as it sucks, he’s right. If Pug groups are harder to come by it will incentive people to be more invested in their guild.

"Nude" feminist march from goldshire to sw with 3-4 more female human characters at 4am being level 6-7 priest (aaand I'm a man, just don't like human male priest in dress). There was nobody there to see us and we just role-played it a bit for 30 mins or so. 
---
Also, being The Collector of recipes for my profesions. I had to have EVERY SINGLE ONE. Kept being like that for years but still missing about 5 total from that time. Rep grind - check, farmable drops - check, rare zone drops - check (Beetch please, had truevestment chest recipe and skill AND mats before lvl 57 (required to put on) , made on spot asap i dinged in dungeon) 
---
Only few that eluded me were super rare world drops that were too expensive on ah. 
---
Also i had to know dungeons, all of them, their quirks, shortcuts, valuable rares spawning there, pathways. I can replay places like maraudon, sunken temple or brd from memory and not skip a thing - yes, worst, longest and most convoluted dungeons there were on vanilla imho. 
---
It made game fun for me outside raiding, those bits of knowledge, exploration and delving into lore. Hope i can get it back with classic again.
---
The point is, if all rolls seem fair but you don't see the trading going on behind the scene you will believe them to be trustworthy.
---
And even if the organiser are trustworthy, nothing prevent a group of friend/guildies to join and roll on items they actually don't need to then trade it to their friend.
---
It's a meme/joke just relax dude.
---
Is this from original Vanilla? Looks like 4:3 monitors, but they have pretty modern 1.12 UIs and proper keybinds which seems more like pserver footage
---
Speaketh the catacombs playing ninja looter who got with his buddies and sold drops in dungeons/raids to the poor PuGs they scammed into helping them.
---
Go back to retail
---
Nice summary image, thanks for sharing.
---
&gt;Vanilla already was the best "Vanilla WoW" experience possible imho. No pserver has ever topped that for me.
---
I understand that, but its not exactly the same anymore and it won't be on the classic servers either. This is the age of min-maxing, and thats how the server will play out.
---
&gt;Also realm caps were in WoW for a reason. As studd like spawntimes, herb / mining nodes and baislcy the whole economy was balanced around that player cap. Changing the player cap would also force a lot of other changes to the game.
---
I agree it will have to be tuned appropriately (which I fucking hope they do anyways, 1x vanilla Blizzlike is AWFUL, 15 min on quest objects... have fun questing in groups).
---
But since there is not really any more exploring, and everyone wants to progress as efficiently as possible having much more people at every progression tier is a much bigger advantage.
---
I get your feeling but here is the facts. If you are a lvl 50 warrior and get edgemasters, you are going to sell it. You can buy devilsaur set, your epic mount, and then some by selling edgemasters. Sure you will want edgemasters later but at that point in the game, its better to sell. 
---
So shpuld the warrior get to sell it just cause its his BiS?
---
I would gladly take a 500 population increase but anything over and I think you're getting into issues with fighting over resources and other things that are prevelant in pservers and have bad bandaid fixes despite some others not wanting to admit it.
---
Also, in regards to forming groups people that complain always talk about just spamming a /lfg/ channel, that's a horrible way to find people. Just /who c-warrior 52-58 , 60-60 c-mage etc. and ask people in the appropriate lvl if they want to run a dungeon. Doing this takes a few characters of typing but I'd often be able to form a group 5-7x quicker or compared to just asking in channels where perhaps I could not fill it at all. 
---
Can only agree, it's a bit tedious, gotta say sorry myself, I don't want this (seemingly) endless discussion become more toxic than it already is. In the end we'll become what blizz gives us anyway. And many of us will enjoy it :)
---
Yes. I've played on plenty of private servers. And I always disliked dynamic spawns. The more people are on a server the less social the game becomes.
---
Indeed
---
To be honest with you I can't wait to play on a normal server again. Gameplay wise private server quality went up post-Nostalrius but it wasn't the real game.
---
&gt; I might be wrong, but I don't think they were when they were added, and you had to go to ashenvale to queue WSG etc. I thought they weren't. 
---
They werent when they were added. out of my head 1.4 added BG's and you had to walk to Ashenvale for example.
---
1.5 Added Battlemasters so you could queue in the capital cities. 
---
1.12 added Crossrealm Battlegrounds. 
---
Go Dwarf :^)
---
That's not modern UI. It's from original Vanilla.
---
Except almost all the armor looks incredibly stupid and completely unrealistic, even for a fantasy setting. 
---
Barrens chat was the original toxic chat room imo. I'm not numb to the fact that internet culture is realistically terrible. And I admittedly havent played much retail lately. but every new expansion i tend to buy and level a toon to max (blizz prolly loves me) and often dont have any meaningful interaction with other players during the leveling process. Sure you can join guilds and raid, do heroics, etc. but the real bonds come when youre questing in STV fighting for your life at every turn.
---
To be honest I have no fucking clue how I kill warlocks because I've never even had to try.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/4gLSP3z](https://imgur.com/a/4gLSP3z)
---
I don't care to be labeled as an asshole if it can buy me an epic mount and every other thing i might want because of how expensive these gloves can be sold. 
---
Yes Edgemasters is BiS and i would still sell them because 3k gold is more important for me than a 30 dps increase. I never said i was gonna buy it again later.
---
Gold is a Need for every class. Lets say Pendulum of Doom drops. Its an upgrade fpr the warrior that he will use for maybe 10 levels. But its an OP twink item that ppl pay 1000g+ for. The warrior isnt a twink, its just a minor upgrade he will vendor before he hits 60. Meanwhile, any class could buy their Pre BiS or epic mount with it. So I would say they Need it more. The warrior who wants a minor upgrade for leveling is the one being Greedy. 
---
My first thought haha. My monitor stuck out a couple feet from the wall with the enormous back too.
---
Barrens chat was legit. That's called community. 
---
I'm saying in 2019 you won't have that majority of people anymore. 
---
Cmon dude tourists make the world feel alive. How are you supposed to feel superior to everyone if there's nobody to feel superior to? Crushing retail baddies in PvP is going to be at least 50% of my entertainment in Classic :D
---
&gt; some 1.12 macros are impossible now, or will need to be rewritten to match the new format
---
Lots of the fancy 1.12 macros will be just impossible. The modern format doesn't allow a macro to distinguish aura stacks, mana level, health level, whether the target is poisoned, etc
---
There's still plenty of room for a poker addon.
---
Guildies can just wait till after you leave to trade it
---
tell me are rogue tier 1 or tier2 actually usable in raids?
---
like is there real competition for it? I know when I played warlock it was super easy to get t1 and t2 full ( was first on nost pve to get them at least on H) cuz most pieces were worse than whatever blues and greens
---
We're discussing everything into the ground because we're all agonizingly waiting.
---
Very cool style. I'd love to see one of Loch Modan or Ashenvale
---
I have always been of the opinion 4k-5k should be server size. That being said 6 million subs said otherwise in 2005 lol.
---
Its a mixed bag, yes, BG queues arent as good, it takes longer to find groups, but at the same time, it might actually be possible to get a tidal charm, or arena master or actually farm effectively. The lower population also encourages people to take grouping opportunities when they can, so its not as bad as it could be.
---
I dont think raid pugging is a big deal. This is where pserver meta is going to come through and youre just going to have them on offraid nights from raiders alts wanting to get gear. 
---
Lastly, if you work nights or such, just roll a server that has a prime time that youre available so you can raid there. There were always the occasional Aussie or Euro in my NA guilds back in the day, works the same the other way around.
---
This isn't really about min max. If you don't have dwarf priests in raid you fucking wipe most of the time
---
So it's like the 2 dwarfs have to carry the 3 nelfs and then your personal desire to look at nelf ass is making someone else do more work. That's gone beyond the realm of "min max"
---
Its logical because you will use the money from selling edgies to buy devilsaur set AND Lionheart Helm. Way more bang for your buck. You will want edgemasters later , but hopefully you make some money by then. If the warrior is planning to tank at 60, its an easy decision to sell. Maybe you should learn about warrior itemization and game economy before you try to "logic" your way through this.
---
/cast [stance:3] Whirlwind; Cleave
---
/cast [nocombat, stance:1] Charge; [nocombat] Battle Stance; &lt;&gt;
---
Modern macros can't detect auras, health, rage level, etc. Good riddance imo
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0
---
Yeah you are right, I remember back on retail queuing for WSG, then going to back to quest for like an hour and then having the queue pop.
---
Warlock will have a LOT more gear available to them compared to any 3 flavors of shaman spec without DM, gearing up a shaman will be really difficult due to the abysmal lack of useful gear until the proposed Stage 3.
---
OR, you could just be a man and zap alliance with lightning in wpvp.
---
Holy mother of task bars!
---
A name for a Tauren raid leader: GrillSergeant.
---
Would be the best solution. 
---
Baeby! I remember you, female mage. I was Desecate, warlock.
---
The API is apparently based on 7.3.5 ...so im guessing we should expect something akin to Legion era 
---
You need DM for the Warlock and Pally questlines, not to gain the epic riding skill for all classes.
---
/use Skull of Impending Doom  
---
/cancelaura Flee
---
/stopcasting
---
/cast [@mouseover, harm][] Counterspell
---
Yeah, pretty simplified
---
The weapon skill is like 10% more damage. I guess we'll see how it ends up being implemented in Classic.
---
And I can't count... That's over 12 characters.
---
Yes there they are. In exactly the version of the game blizzard is basing classic on.
---
Worth noting shadow priest is one of the least gear dependent specs where you aren’t missing out as much on raiding because of itemization if you can go for rank 10 pvp gear. And it’s faster leveling than shaman.
---
Ele shaman is also not as gear dependent/missed out less on raiding, if you similarly go for rank 10/maybe even dungeon set 2. (30/0/21). And would be very functional for dungeons and solo as well, and even a casual raid to heal though you are missing mana tide.
---
Warlock is more gear dependent than the other 2/definitely misses out more from not raiding. But warlock is reasonably strong so it might not be the end of the world. And 30/0/21 (sm/ruin) is great for pvp and even raiding.
---
I’m tryibg to convince my friend who won’t have as much time to play to go spriest or ele shaman for the reasons above. (Ele is more hybrid, bursts and heals in pvp)
---
Until the recent blue post, we ran out of things to discuss.
---
EDIT 3/12/2019: So, I made a v2 which has all the books in chronological order and I added dates, timeline, and some pictures. Additionally, I added transcripts from In-Game Cinematic, and character (faction/race/class) intro screens including opening cinematic transcripts for each race. Added summarization and pictures of all patchs 1.2 to 1.12. Also, added additional short stories/books:
---
•The Sundering of the World, The Alliance Splinters, &amp; The Battle of Mount Hyjal that were from "History of Warcraft".
---
•Mythology of the Titans that is part of the Chapter I: Mythos ("History of Warcraft") and is an in-game book that is a quest item.
---
•The War of the Shifting Sands, The War Effort, and the Road to Damnation which were official short stories from WoW Website.
---
You were trying to cross the border right? Same as us!
---
Reroll Troll or Undead.
---
I don't think itll be exactly the same by any means. and im sure I romanticize it in my mind. But the way I see it WoW has turned into a game of hardly any community other than randoms throwing gold at streamers so they can see there toon on twitch for a split second. Which is what im mostly hoping to avoid in classic, but i sadly feel like is what some people are going to try and make classic into, especially from reading some of these threads. 
---
&gt;Every miss click by a ML, every accidental need roll
---
(Taking this to a hyperbolic extreme) if we get killed in a raid as we misclicked a button should we be allowed to rollback the raid a few seconds and reclick the right ability? No, we die, this might cause a raid wipe, you'll get shouted out and maybe benched/kicked out.
---
Similarly for loot, if I misclick its MY fault and I need to learn to live with the consequences of my action.
---
BoE=BoE, BoP=BoP. If you get a BoP it should be locked, just like Vanilla was. This also removes the rolling-need-for-a-guildie issue, as if you do that the item gets soulbound to you, so you cant trade it to your guildie, hence you'll not roll for it in the first place.
---
That vanilla doesn't exist anymore because know the game.
---
and even on 10k+ servers are recognizable, and its easy to make friends unless you are intentionally anti-social. You will see the same faces in your progression tier, but the thing is, so will other people in their own progression tiers so everybody wins!
---
But there’s a good chance he won’t be 60 before stage 2 or 3 anyway, no? 
---
Yea you never had Naxx gear did you? Or fight an actually good, naxx geared, SL lock? 
---
You are just talking out of your ass.
---
Well, I find it irritaing to have to toggle back and forth between looking for herbs and ore. I know many people do it effortlessly and have it hot-keyed, but I'd argue it's not worth it.
---
great offtank iirc especially early on like bwl
---
might main tank on some bosses
---
you really gotta know what you are doing tho
---
I don't recall the order of warlock pet abilities, but 
---
&gt;/click PetActionButton4
---
will click the 4th button on your pet's action bar. 
---
I have no problem with loot trading.  It seems the main regulatory means to this will be not sharding, forum reputation, and forming groups/friendships
---
This is one dude. Why does he get to speak for everyone? 
---
&gt;I agree with that and we had that to an back in the day like casters not wanting to do SM armory. The thing is with a lower population people are forced to cooperate or they get nothing done. Don't want to do Sm armory for your tank as a mage ? Guess what hes not going to tank cathedral or library for you so you're forced to help each other out.
---
Or.... they will just skip SM entirely, which is much more likely.
---
Useless healing bots taken only for buffs, battle res and innervate. If you want the truth.
---
Population cap was good enough back then, it will be good enough again in Classic.
---
seeings lots of people active in the cities
---
That was actually a really good video imo, one of the few classic vid's with actual knowledgeable people giving decent advice, and explanations for why you choose the things you do.  
---
People shit alot on this tips guy, but you can make good content, without having played the game religiously for 15 years.
---
Agreed. It's optimal for everyone's first character to be a hunter, but it's jus to otime-consuming to do what's optimal at the expence of how you ultimatly want to enjoy the game.
---
BG queue times are a solved problem with 1.12 and x-realm BGs, which seems pretty safe to assume we'll have until Blizz officially says otherwise.
---
Yeah, thats why nax isn't out on release, is it?
---
Or is it just the talents?
---
apparently not the itemization either, I am just too confused.
---
I will assume that since cross-faction BGs was not a thing for 90% of vanilla it won't be a thing on the classic servers either :)
---
Its because we were all R14 and had Naxx on farm and want a real challenge 
---
/s obviously
---
I would be interested to see a chart or graph on spell costs as you level in classic.  alas I can't find one!
---
Basic things like /cast, /use, /equip etc work just fine, it's the /script that really got changed.
---
Instead of scripting, now conditions are the hot stuff. It can't detect the same variety that scripts can, but I prefer it that way. Stuff like [mod:shift, help][@mouseover, dead][nopet, nocombat][@cursor]
---
Oh, and if you don't specify the rank for a spell, it'll automatically pick the highest rank you know. Other than that, simple stuff is the same
---
I'm looking forward to raiding being an exclusive activity again rather that something you PUG reliably via general chat. That's part of the charm of the vanilla experience.
---
Even clearing MC in vanilla was accomplished by a small percentage of the population due to all the work we had to put in simply to qualify for raiding. The raid encounters themselves have always been easy; the hard part of raiding in vanilla was the prep work, discipline, and time management. Flaky, unreliable people tended not to end up with raid epics.
---
Every expansion has opened up guild raiding for more and more of the playerbase. It started in TBC by reducing the number of people needed for raids from 40 to 25. By the time of WoD you have raids that dynamically scale difficulty according to the number of people you bring so that you don't even have to maintain a dedicated raiding team -- you can just bring along whoever shows up on raid night.
---
I'm looking forward to having it mean something to be a raider again. It means that you endured the difficulty of getting groups to farm your pre-BiS and you then you won the competition for the limited number of spots on a raid team and then you managed your personal schedule to show up reliably on time for raid nights. People who feel entitled to win epics without making any personal sacrifices to be part of a team can go play retail.
---
that's why those items are BoE in the first place. BoE's are *meant to be traded*. BoP items are NOT meant to be traded, whoever loots it is the only person who can use it. That's why allowing trading of BoP's even for a short time violates the design intent of the game. 
---
I would say that depends on your skill and support from guild that will allow to do so.
---
We have a druid that tanks all of MC, most of BLW and a handful of bosses in Naxx. He's full BIS tanking gear though. I was impressed that he MT's Patchwerk in Naxx. He really comes in handy for 4HM due to the number of tanks required for it.
---
&gt; another post on demo problems when it was stated multiple times that it was developed in a rush and down ported from the patch 7.3.5 UI for the downloadable version
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;I would gladly take a 500 population increase but anything over and I think you're getting into issues with fighting over resources and other things that are prevelant in pservers and have bad bandaid fixes despite some others not wanting to admit it.
---
Sounds like WARcraft and a MMORPG, doesn't it?
---
I should be able to hit 60 in 2-3 months of play but I definitely don't have recent experience playing vanilla so I keep hearing both sides :P 
---
In 1.12 there is now this addon HonorSpy that inspects people and checks their current honor for the week. But it also uses a hidden channel to sync your HonorSpy data with everyone else using it constantly. Like a distributed database. It writes your local cache when you log off.
---
Is this type of thing supported in 7.x?
---
There won't be cross-realm BG (hopefully) as it was added at the very end of vanilla.
---
They are not starting with nax released, so then they shouldn't launch with cross-realm either.
---
Damn, I love the idea of playing a shadow priest but the thought of constantly being rejected from getting into groups and raids makes me sad lol 
---
Also, I always thought shadow was weak early due to be so squishy? Maybe I'm wrong?
---
either of them are great
---
especially if you are worried about getting raid invites
---
warlock is a strong pvper but mostly for 1v1s and that wont happen often. Resilient as fuck but you depend on having the right pet for the right encounter.
---
purge, windfury and bloodlust are amazing but Im not personally a fan of shamans cuz they lack CC so they seem too easy to focus
---
Well, i had no idea, until now, thank you ;)
---
In 2 years of playing vanilla WoW, I can remember exactly once when the ML gave an item to the wrong person. 
---
If they implement loot trading, there is a perverse incentive in EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE run to abuse it to the benefit of a group of 2-4 players running the instance with a few other randoms. 
---
Except the game won't be played the same.
---
Exploration is not a thing, and its all about min-maxing. People will only run dungeons they need and AV will be a rush fest from both sides to make it more effective for both sides.
---
Looks cool but there is no info about rare pets like Lupus. Yeah i know he is from wolf's family. But without rares beasts this pets list is not full.
---
Not every priest in the raid needed to be dwarf... ever.
---
Nor do i even plan on touching raids in classic , dickhead. The second someone says they wont play optimally, people like you come out of the woodwork without fail. 
---
So just play on the lowest pop server available, farm your shit and then pay for a server transfer to a real server.
---
World-resources should be contested
---
Wasn't it 1.9? I very well might be wrong though.
---
My soul is ready, but my social life isn't. However, there's still a few months to convert my friends, so we shall see. :-)
---
See, here's the whole problem with people like you arguing for server population increases. You don't want x-realm BGs (actually part of vanilla), but you also don't want long queue times, so you argue for massive ubserservers (definetly not part of vanilla) in order to solve the problem you created because you don't want features that were part of vanilla.
---
Will we not be having the rogue revamp ether because that was added in 1.12?
---
I have no idea if x-realm will be included or not, but smart money is on it being included.
---
Look at the patchnotes. Basically 90% what's written there will be in the game. All the talent and mechanic changes.
---
The only things that will be different is what's described in the 6 patches they will roll out.
---
If crossrealm bg's aren't there I won't be sad. I'd be fine with them also doing progressive talents and everything.
---
But I expect crossrealm bg's to be there with the bg patch.
---
Nah, it will be all good.
---
Yikes!  .... oof! ... youchers ... 
---
&gt; Not every priest in the raid needed to be dwarf... ever.
---
No, but 2 dwarfs have to carry the 3 nelfs and then your personal desire to look at nelf ass is making someone else do more work
---
AS I JUST SAID
---
And if you don't plan on raiding then keep your comments about min maxers outta here because you aren't even doing the content where min maxing is relevant. You have absolutely nothing to contribute to the discussion and your first comment was purely to bait.
---
No.
---
I was referring to the volume of support tickets they would have had to deal with back in Vanilla. They probably looked back at those numbers, scaled them and realised it wasn't worth it.
---
Even clearing MC in vanilla was accomplished by a small percentage of the population due to all the work we had to put in simply to qualify for raiding. The raid encounters themselves have always been easy; the hard part of raiding in vanilla was the prep work, discipline, and time management. Flaky, unreliable, uncommitted people tended not to end up with raid epics.
---
**tl;dr:** Welcome to vanilla, baby -- accessibility is a dirty word and puggers can go pound sand.
---
What exactly are the arguments against loot trading anyway? What about right-click reporting? I keep seeing people say it's a problem but no one seems to actually specify.
---
I can see loot trading being exploitable (a friend rolls on a item to give to his friend in the same group), but what's the problem with right-click reporting? People are worried about getting automatically banned / restricted in some way from mass reports?
---
Does ele sham get gear options from DM?
---
So what do you suggest?
---
While not considered the 'best' they are still perfectly viable. At the end of the day with so many new people playing classic and tanks always being needed, I honestly think if you put the work in you will be fine. If deep down you love the druid fantasy and want to be a feral tank, do it. There's been feral druids tanking naxx on private servers which on average is probably more hardcore than most guilds coming into classic wow. 
---
I think this quest line would be “legendary” if remade into the game, but we know what the future will bring to us.
---
This would be awesome if “WoW 2” was a project.
---
This is exactly what I plan to do. I will have a main that I will play most, but I will also have a priest and lock for dungeon levelling on rested exp. I will have 3 level capped characters in around 20 days played. With about 10-15 hours a week I will have 3x 60 within a year. The next five years to do all the rep grinds and raiding I want to do. We won’t even have naxx for 18+ months after release so I should have plenty of time to keep one character in current raid tier. 
---
I just dont trust it. As much as I agree with you about community, I dont trust 2019
---
If there are twice as many people, there are twice as many DPS and healers LFG too.  This does not solve the tank issue.
---
Isnt bears supposed to be able to eat fish also? Might be wrong though
---
I've said it that way and as "furlblog"
---
Of course they should, but in the natural ebb and flow of things, it's good to have that "low tide" time.
---
&gt;  I was impressed that he MT's Patchwerk in Naxx
---
yeah well bears have like 11k hp there
---
Yes I believe so. There are addon communication channels. This even existed in 1.12 which is probably how HonorSpy works. But it's not like a global channel where the addon is communicating with everyone on the server with that addon. It only communicates with others in your party or raid and maybe guild.
---
Seriously, players who want 10k+ populations, or zero effort dungeon grouping and not want to join a guild to allievate that issue can go back to private server land or retail.
---
Maybe this thread should be a wake up call for people who think **"LOL 4k POP IS DED"** and realize Classic WoW is not for them.
---
That's why the Warrior needs to immediately equip it if they're needing on it.
---
It's noy obtuse. Like they said in the blue post its all about not making MC/BWL a joke in terms of difficulty.  
---
Why would u do MC as a caster when there are like 2-3 items in total that are better than dungeon blues unless u minmax?  
---
Your right never fought a good lock they just rolled over and died.
---
If you want to play &lt;x&gt;, power to you. But if you just want to play &lt;y&gt;, don't play &lt;x&gt; just to enable that. Playing &lt;y&gt; is fine. Is it worth spending 250 hours leveling &lt;x&gt; just so you can start farming gold?
---
Yeah although it's expected that some parts of the API will be held back or hidden from the user in order to keep the game close to vanilla.
---
&gt;here's the whole problem with people like you arguing for server population increases. You don't want x-realm BGs (actually part of vanilla)
---
Yeah, the very last patch before the TBC pre-patch, so 90% of vanilla was not cross-realm BG.
---
&gt;but you also don't want long queue times, so you argue for massive ubserservers (definetly not part of vanilla) in order to solve the problem you created because you don't want features that were part of vanilla.
---
I want them because they are better for how the game is currently played and will be played on the classic as well. People will play much more efficiently than they did back in the day. All content is known, there is no exploration, and everyone is going to min max (at least 80% of the people who actually hit 60).
---
If you think it will be the same experience as it was 14 years ago you are wrong. And its has already been tested by private servers which has come to the conclusion that high pop servers are overwhelmingly preferred as they fit the "current" version of vanilla better, as it adds more flesh to every progression tier. So if you are a slow ass lvler and hit 60 late, there will still be lots of plebs doing to MC, as oppose to the 2 guilds on your server being deep into AQ already and you not being able to find enough people who are the same stage as you are.
---
&gt;Will we not be having the rogue revamp ether because that was added in 1.12?
---
I would prefer them going 1.0-&gt; 1.12 in terms of class changes,but we are not getting that.
---
&gt;I have no idea if x-realm will be included or not, but smart money is on it being included.
---
Maybe, if they enforce hipster low-pop server where there aren't enough people to fill BGs, but they might as well add cross realm LFG at the same time then tbh.
---
Hop on an undocumented server if you want to try it out but tbh you'll be fine. Designed to be basic and a lot of people will be doing the quests that involve going into those caves which causes people to group up together. Have fun
---
Most leveling that fast tend to level farming classes. They want dead zones because they are grinding hundreds of gold before you even hit level 30. They can max out collection professions to feed their true alt.
---
They then level a raid alt with the remaining professions required to be self sustained and likely also hit 60 before your main. They have also likely farmed rares drops for items the masses will likely never see.
---
I've not seen on person who knows how to power level to 60, to not have a plan and cherish every moment being ahead of the curve.
---
Sure, there may be the few that just had no life to do so and no real plan, but that isn't the norm.
---
I’m saying it’s like that right now , it’s just in the same instance. It’d be way cooler if it was closer in levels and reward, the paths would have felt way more interesting because choices would have been more enticing.
---
Hmm I’m not an expert but I’ve read a lot of people talk about shadow priests in posts like this. I think priests shields don’t scale with gear for one, which gives them a bit more survivability when undergeared. I think a big thing is the itemization similarly to ele shaman where the  tier sets except AQ are +healing focused, so even if you get dmg/healing gear that is lower item lvl, you aren’t missing out as much from not raiding. You might want to google some other posts regarding shadow priests on this topic.
---
Fair point, I just have no idea how long each stage will be -- and I'd rather not just blindly assume he will be an ultra casual leveler.
---
From 3 absolutely i would choose 6. But 6 imo is too long, ppl are accustomed to the game to the  quests and how it works.
---
Even if someone doesnt rush it (like me).I would propably reach 60 in 2,5 months. Most hardcore ppl will make it like 4 weeks maybe? And those who can just spent 2-3 or hours max, will take them about  4 months...
---
People are efficient nowdays..even if we dont spent much time..I think around 4...5(is ideal)
---
quite a few, and even then can fill in a lot of slots with good SP int/stam leather gear as well.
---
I was never impressed.  For starters, warriors will reach defense cap way easier, so much so that they will start looking at gear without defense in naxx because they have already hit 440.  Warriors get utility it of stance dancing that includes mocking blow.  They get better "oh shit" buttons like last stand and shield wall.  People cite threat per second, but I haven't seen anything where a good warrior can't hold the threat.  For what it is worth, I was a main tank through naxx in vanilla, and I am rolling a druid because I love the class (it was the only class I looked at with jealousy back in the day).  However, I will be making zero push to tank or offtank.  
---
Any   semi hardcore NA guilds that will be raiding later at night, like 9:00   p.m. PST. Prefer horde but willing to play alliance too if I can find a   good community.
---
I raided as a mage in Vanilla. Cleared MC, BWL, AQ 20/40, ZG, and Naxx, cleared spider, abom, plauge, and 2/3 DK wing.
---
In   TBC I played mage again for the first raid tier, then switched to prot   warrior and was OT for my guild through TK, SSC, BT, Hyjal. For  Sunwell I  switched over to resto druid and killed M'uru (fuck this guy)  pre 3.0  and KJ after. Class switches were at the request of the guild  due to our  needs not me just class jumping.
---
Went   super casual in WoTLK and just pvp'd/arena'd while pugging around for   raids. Quit early into the expansion and also did not play during   cataclysm and mists. Came back at the tail end of WoD and cleared up to   Mythic Archimonde playing mage.
---
Played   in Legion and raided in a top U.S. 100 guild as a healing priest.   Cleared mythic EN and TV. Cleared 9/10 mythic Nighthold. I quit when my   daughter was born and my guild killed Gul'dan the week after.
---
And   now I am here, no interest to play retail from everything I have been   reading but fully pumped to play Classic. But between work and family   time, I can only play late night. I do not know what class I will play, I   am tossing around mage for nostalgia but would not mind going priest   heals or war tank.
---
I thought so also. I believe I remember bears eating fish at the end of Wrath, not sure if it was new, or actually classic.
---
Does being in battleground count as being in raid or party? It may sync when you get into a BG with other people using it
---
theres always a free server if they manage to mess up my experience 
---
Blackrock Depths was overwhelming on paper but I remember most people went straight for Emperor Thaurissan so you often skipped a lot of those multitudes of bosses. There was a lot of repetition in the first parts of Sunken Temple and even the second part where there are lots of slow pulls involving ghosts blowing you up even after death or Fear shooting you into more adds with your only CC option being Freezing Trap or Shackle Undead or even Hibernate at that point.
---
These 2 classes and Mage are the 3 I'm most considering. Funny enough they're the 3 I got the farthest in Vanilla (Mage 60 raiding into Naxx, lock and sham both levelled to ~40)
---
5 months might be a bit too much if we're going phase to phase. We don't need years before even seeing AQ.
---
Shaman's don't have bloodlust, and in vanilla Elemental is a much stronger spec -- assuming there is any decent gear options available early on in Classic.
---
We don’t know what their exact timeline will be, but I’d assume DM will be available to you at least very shortly after hitting 60. You might have to wait a bit more for pvp gear and stuff, but again you’ll probably want to spend some time on things like professions, getting at least moderate gear from dungeons, etc., and I’m assuming you won’t have to wait that long in the grand scheme of things. We’ll probably no more soon.
---
&gt;Imagine power leveling yourself so fast that you're the only person in desolace
---
That sounds great. Sign me up.
---
&gt;Look at the patchnotes. Basically 90% what's written there will be in the game. All the talent and mechanic changes.
---
Yes, its mostly based on  1.12.1, but they are doing some "custom" progression stuff based on the older patches.
---
&gt;If crossrealm bg's aren't there I won't be sad. I'd be fine with them also doing progressive talents and everything.
---
I wanted that as it would shake up the meta more, and give players more incentives to figure shit out every patch, as oppose to only looking up known itemization. the 1.12.1 talents and itemization is already so well theorized that its figured out, if they reversed talents it would shake things up a bit.
---
&gt;But I expect crossrealm bg's to be there with the bg patch.
---
I don't think so but I really don't do BGs anyways.
---
I know, I managed to do every dungeon that I wanted to going from 1-60 on a tiny &gt;200 people online PvE private server. People think it’s the end of the world if you don’t find a full group in 20 minutes. Of course not saying I want to play with such a small pop, but 2-3k people sharing a time zone is more than adequate. 
---
That's weird because bears are known for standing in streams and eating fish IRL.
---
Skinning is stable and predictable. Enchanting can have high returns (particularly selling wands on the GE), but it's going to be more involved, and either you're bleeding money leveling it, or you're spending lots of time barking instead of leveling. Of course, once you cap 60, that's a whole different ball game
---
The servers will most likely be localized anyways (EU, NA etc) so if you drop out of  work/school for a day or sit up all night I am sure you will be able to farm anyways on a high pop server.
---
A nelf hunter clicker ganking grays... yep this is gonna be happening in 6 months all over again lul
---
That would not work or it would be immense amount of work for the devs. They would have to actually create new items with new IDs that didn't exist in vanilla database before and add them to all the same loottables and everything and make sure nothing breaks by referencing the old item ID only. 
---
Basically they would not be able to refer to certain item by ID, because there will be 2 items with the same ID and it would not be unique anymore, OR you would have the "same" item with 2 different IDs and that would have to be accounted for everywhere. What if some part of code says "show item with id 1232". What if addons or macros do that (idk)? Doable, but certainly big change to the code and database.
---
Yes, tier 1 and tier 2 are BiS for the content. 
---
Yep, just proving my point here.
---
Where are you in game? I don't recognize it.
---
The server cap was an intentional design decision and that worked very well when servers were full. I pugged groups and did pickup raids in Vanilla and it was never a problem, it took a little bit of effort and engaging with the community (which is a good thing for the classic)
---
What Blizzard does need to do is have a plan for dwindling server populations so servers don't get to the state you describe (Which is NOT how full servers were)
---
Also if you’ll still be able to shoot for t1/t2 from casual raids, then ya warlock is maybe the best/easiest option for gearing because those are already good sets for pvp with high stam, and the other classes are harder to gear from the most casual of raids. 
---
I was saying if you really couldn’t raid at all, then the other classes miss out less if you can get some blue pvp gear since they don’t get great gear from raids till T2.5
---
Loot trading is no more dangerous than master looter.
---
The fears of groups of friends forming pugs to gear specific individuals are entirely unfounded, and anyone looking to do that would accomplish the same thing more effectively by simply masterlooting the items to that person rather than relying on chance to win a roll and trading it to them later.
---
&gt;It has no other effect on the game at all.
---
Not sure how you can believe this. 
---
You're a Hunter in a BRD group. Ironfoe drops. Warrior and Rogue roll need on it. Loot transfer is available so fuck it, you roll need too. You roll a 80, Warrior rolls 54, Rogue rolls 12. You win the Ironfoe and sell it to the Rogue.
---
Without loot transfer, the Ironfoe would have gone to the Warrior.
---
I'm not even advocating for or against loot transfer, but there's no way that I can pretend that it won't have a significant impact on how the game is played.
---
I don't know what point your trying to make but you clearly aren't proving anything omegalul
---
Shadow Priest endgame 100% best caster in pvp, unbeatable against other caster classes and unbeatable by melee. Not to mention how insanely favored it is as a dwarf vs melee or an UD vs casters. 
---
By far the best pvp caster endgame. 
---
My only gripe with it is being screwed over on loot by being in a minority within a dungeon group. If I’m solo and I group up with a team of 4, and both me and one of those 4 players are both going after the same item, then you know all 4 of them will roll in attempt to have 4 rolls to beat mine. If any of them win, then they trade the loot to the 1/4 that needs it. Instead of just me and him rolling it out since we both need. It will destroy solo players’ progression. 
---
The only thing you need to know: go to Felwood after you hit 60, shadowmeld behind the flight master at the horde camp on the west central side of the zone, mind control horde and jump them off the cliff when they land at the fp.
---
Is this from the current Retail version?
---
I love your artwork but this map does not ring true for me. There is a whole section to the south that is missing.
---
Plenty for melee too, I don't remember all of them but Savage Gladiator Chain is big for warriors

---
&gt; but now that we have a 2nd chance at vanilla is something that should be re-evaluated.
---
But that is the very opposite of the design philosophy of Classic. This is not a second chance to remake vanilla with more experience. It's hard to even count how much crap design there were in vanilla, but we are not going to chance it because this is not vanilla 2.0, it's a reconstruction of vanilla as closely as possible.
---
If we follow the logic of "end chance at vanilla" to re-evaluate, then we should also chance the PvP system, class balance, itemisation, etc. And that's not even touching on the overflow of unfinished stuff ranging from questlines that just stops without ever carrying the story to a conclusion to full on zones being half-done.
---
Sure, some things are probably objectively bad and the majority would enjoy it changed, but as it's been said a thousand times, it's Pandora's box. At the very least, launch needs to be vanilla. If something is overwhelmingly hated it *might* be cause for debate of changes, but they need to launch *vanilla* first.
---
I'd love to see it in from the start, with the caveat they remove dishonorable kills. World PvP (and specifically city raids) is one of the things I'm most looking forward to in Classic, and dHKs put a huge damper on that from the moment they were implemented.
---
You actually type out omegalul. Cringey af. 
---
&gt; It hurts progression
---
how do you figure? you think people didn't progress it's vanilla, you're not supposed to speed clear it in a few days - it's a journey.
---
&gt;especally in vanilla where are too much content that you can't do alone. Lot of classes can't even fucking farm without respeccing, questing can be real aids as there a fucktong of elite quests, so you always want to have a lot of people to play with.
---
don't be a jerk, make friends, keep in contact with those friends, join a guild together, make lifelong relationships - like we did back in retail vanilla
---
&gt;With higher pop you get more people in each progression tier, so content becomes more accessible and less of a slug fest. ...... higher pop just tackles the most tedious aspect of vanilla which is the downtime where you can end up not being able to do anything.
---
it's slow, that's vanilla. I get what you're saying, more people see more things before the new content - but that's not vanilla-like. some people will just lag behind - I did back in retail vanilla days, I still loved playing, I found people who played at the same speed, we had a ball together farming and raiding together.
---
&gt;Keep in mind that battlegrounds won't be cross-realm, there are no summoning stones (there are but they aren't "summoning" stones)
---
so? cross realm was a bandaid at the very end of vanilla - maybe, if at the end of the content releases if there's an issue, maybe then they can make some adjustments - but to come out of the gate with huge changes is a little extreme. I would like slightly higher pop servers myself, but not extremely high pop servers
---
again, it's not the end of the world to have 2500-3000 people, you just have to play the game a certain way
---
&gt;Of course not saying I want to play with such a small pop, but 2-3k people sharing a time zone is more than adequate.
---
Try lvling a new character like a month or two after the herd has hit 60, get to 60. Try to find a raiding guild at your progression tier (most are probably already deep in BWL or AQ already) and you have fallen too far behind the general progression tier, as there aren't enough players to fill every tier.
---
People will separate themselves from the herd and either go ahead or fall behind, and the more players in each tier the less downtime you have, and the better experience you can have in any content, as oppose to either just being completely carried through it, having no reason to do it or not being able to do it at all since you are too far behind. An example can be the random ass 20 man elite quest in EPL, try getting a group for that on a "blizzlike"popped server a few months in after people have hit 60.
---
I don't want to use a virus adware infested website that the owner tells people to suck it up and pay or get viruses.
---
When they made bears a real thing they added that in.
---
Loot trading isn't an issue.
---
Zone into an instance while in a party, then leave the group. Wait out the 60 second timer and you will be hearthed, even if your hearth was on cooldown. It's cooldown will be reset to 60 minutes.
---
An alternative to TBC content maybe, but for Vanilla No.
---
Or maybe some people want to be able to pick and chose between more than 2 raiding guilds to join, or be able to start fresh 60 progression if they hit 60 later than the herd.
---
More people, more spread, better experience for all content. And obviously less downtime.
---
If you already have a guild planned out right now, then a 1k pop server won't be a problem for you, but for the rest of us who likes having option, the more people means more options.
---
His values as far as enjoyment revolve somewhat around good farming skills for gold based on his post, from there you can give less vague answers into what he wants.
---
They aren‘t, they are actually great and fun in BGs. Just avoid the min/max „rogues are not viable in BGs“ Privateserver freaks on your server, and you will have a great time
---
Of you're going to be a soulink player, please never play warlock. Your kind is a disgrace to the class.
---
Wow insulting other Intelligence as opposed to bringing any information of RELEVANCE to the conversation...
---
*Rest of thread debates about the morale implications of need vs greed rolls*
---
*PH020: Gais you dont know the proper allocation of funds to buy correct gear. Learn2play nubs!"*
---
Missed the point of the thread/debate entirely...**facepalms**
---
Agreed, this is the best compromise to emulate the original vanilla environment where you could get missclicked raid loot traded with GM help. Loot trading being only available in raid enviroment with master looting would solve 95% of the problems people are worried about.
---
Bash it for no reason other than how damn ugly the new models are. Also why tf are they so big now, what happened?
---
Loot trading was not really in classic. Once a BoP item was looted, the only recourse was getting a GM to intervene.
---
The popular argument on this sub is "If loot trading is possible, more people will be ninjas running in groups to conspire to get all the loot for themselves/extort gold out of others".
---
I don't buy it, but you get to choose what to expect
---
Good to know. With DM not releasing immediately, might make Shaman my 2nd char rather than 1st.
---
Found the OSRS player.
---
No warlock does not, are you looking at 1.10+ dungeon drops? That gear has no spell power in the version we're getting. Everyone has bad gear choices pre-dm.
---
Private server "tests" are crap. There's about 2 to choose from, and the choices people make have less to do with the design decisions of that one and more like picking that server that isn't currently getting DDOSed by Chinese gold farmers. 
---
Not suck at every aspect of the game
---
I don't mind healing in pve as I consider pve an annoying necessity anyways haha. I just don't want to respec to a dps spec for pvp every time I want to bg. That's why I like the 30/0/21 shaman spec :)
---
Grouping up with randos early and often. I played almost exclusively solo or with my GF (May she Rest In Peace) until end game and then trying to make friends.
---
It was more difficult afterwards since everyone had formed up already.
---
On pirate servers im like 99% sure they can eat everything, same as with boars. But those are just pirate servers so 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Rogues are really good for 1v1 wpvp since you can pick your fights or avoid them.
---
But for group wpvp, 5v5 10v10 and 40v40 at instance entrances, rogues become more and more useless as the group sizes increase. In guild vs guild it becomes all about AOE spam
---
only PS brd farm exists because they throw nets that IIRC dealt like 500 or 800 DMG. 
---
also how many people here have ever actually mis-looted something?? i have never in my wow career needed an item to be restored. to change a core mechanic of the game, simply to cater to the (i think) minority of people this affects, seems like a bad decision to me.
---
Try to raid more. I have been raiding but mostly in random groups near the end of vanilla. We actually managed to clear AQ40 and it was amazing. But for this time I wish to start earlier to enjoy it longer. 
---
This warms the deepest fibers of my heart 
---
I’m looking at this while at work.
---
Work da poop! 
---
I'm fine with BGs being in the game so long as there's no extra reward for doing them*. Some folks enjoy structured competition more than the beautiful chaos that is wPvP. It ain't my jam, but neither is it hurting anyone.
---
*Or any penalty for doing wPvP instead. I'm looking at you, dHKs.
---
I fully agree, especially on my phone.  
---
I threw it in the OCR software I have access to (really just PDF software). It came out terrible as well:  [https://pastebin.com/91HxrZ2Y](https://pastebin.com/91HxrZ2Y)

---
Are we expecting it to be buggy? I (without evidence) assumed that would be pretty much ironed out by now
---
It certainly is!
---
It looks like a boy in 2013 who edits a screenshot probably taken in 2005.
---
The only people that want high pop servers ate those devilsaur mafia types. They want to form huge conglomerwte multi faction guilda and control the entire server community. You cant do that when the pop is low, you won't have enough players to control things 24/7.
---
&gt;how do you figure? you think people didn't progress it's vanilla, you're not supposed to speed clear it in a few days - it's a journey.
---
Thats not the point I am making, Onyxia attunement will still take forever, or if you want to get that damn UBRS key to milk gold from people. Or be a mage selling your stupid water.
---
What I mean is that the higher the pop the more people there are on your specific progression tier. Vanilla sets people far apart very early, so if you hit 60 late, a lot of people will already deep into MC so you either have to join a guild and be carried/wait for raid spots. Or you could have higher pop with more options and find a recently  new guild that has not even started MC progression (which is your level).
---
and vanilla takes fucking forever to progress in anyways, as everything is slow. Even if you manage to make a dungeon group quickly you still have to wait for 5 people to travel to the dungeon as there are no summoning stones (they don't' summon), and your gearing will be even slower once you hit 40 man raids and have to farm DKP or whatever/loot council.
---
&gt;don't be a jerk, make friends, keep in contact with those friends, join a guild together, make lifelong relationships - like we did back in retail vanilla
---
I agree, which is entirely possible on high pop servers. You find people who are progressing at your level, and then you stick with them. Form rivalries with other guilds, and then you get your best personal experience, as oppose to picking between 2 raiding guilds where possibly neither of them fits your desires.
---
&gt;it's slow, that's vanilla. I get what you're saying, more people see more things before the new content - but that's not vanilla-like. some people will just lag behind - I did back in retail vanilla days, I still loved playing, I found people who played at the same speed, we had a ball together farming and raiding together.
---
And thats especally true for lower pop servers, because there aren't enough people in their progression tier, so then blzzard adds comeback mechanics instead. On higher pop servers people are more spread out so people do all type of content all the time, as oppose to the 2 raiding guilds you can chose from both being into AQ and cba to put you through the long ass gearing progress.
---
&gt;again, it's not the end of the world to have 2500-3000 people, you just have to play the game a certain way
---
It will just be a worse experience, unless you play from launch-&gt; nax.
---
Wasn’t there a countdown to Classic where the dev for Questie was interviewed?
---
You're right. They just cut a bunch of their support staff so from a business perspective it makes sense for them to implement as many changes as they can to reduce CS incidents. Whether or not the community will like those changes is another question.
---
Personally I don't see any harm in guild banks as it's something we could do already with shared accounts. This just reduces the potential for shit to get stolen.
---
Well your "recent experience" means you had 1k bots, 3k chinese which just spams "7&amp;;hjj()!;'_-+++" 24/7 in chat and actually 1k players you could interact with. Ofc it feels dead af &amp; now you think we need higher pop caps.
---
Sub: Server reputation is essential, so ninjas weren't really an issue  
---
Also sub: We are defenseless from the cartels of ninjas I'm sure will be there
---
This makes cave quests impossible. 
---
Indeed. Even in 40 man raids, it always felt like there was a core group of \~20 players that were really good, knew what they were doing, and pretty much carried the other 20 through content. It sucked carrying them, but we needed bodies, lol.  When Zul'Gurub came out, and dropped the raid size down to 20, holy shit it was like a breath of fresh air. That's my one gripe with Classic WoW, is the raid size at 40 is just unwieldy, and finding quality raiders was a chore. 
---
Again I must say I respectfully disagree, which is okay, not all minds think alike.
---
It’s true that the Vanilla I and so many others remember won’t exist ever again. Very few knew what they were doing back then, what the optimal rotation looked like, or what attributes your class should aim for etc. 
---
I believe there will be a lot higher focus on the endgame come Classic, with a lot more 60s than Vanilla originally had and a lot more of them doing «high end» content such as max level dungeons and raids.
---
With that said however, I don’t see why the server community and size would need to change because of it. 
---
Is it because you want easier access to difficult content? Do you want to rely less on building friendships which were needed to help eachother progress?
---
As I stated earlier, I fondly remember the people in Orgrimmar, no matter what «progression tier» they were part of. They were people, some hardcore, some overly obsessed with tradechat and some that always had your back should you need something. And in my opinion that’s what makes a healthy community, surrounding yourself not only with like-minded people, but people with different goals and opinions - like you and me.
---
Well, it seems like you don't get why dual spec is not a fix without problems. The fact that you couldn't just change spec 3 times a day for every activity you had to do meant you were "locked" into a spec. Think about it, spec is short for specialization, it's meant to be your character. The reason you can change spec at all is because WoW was meant as a more casual game, so locking you into something way before you even knew what you were doing would be a pretty annoying thing - but you were not supposed to jump between specs all the time.
---
Now, that is kind of the RP reason for it making sense, but the real reason I enjoy it is because when I meet a PvE player out in the world he will most likely be with PvE spec. I, as a PvP player, will then have the upper hand. This is in turn balanced out by the fact that I am worse in raids. Remember for the vast majority this min/maxing mentality is rather "new". Back then an average Joe PvP player would probably do his limited raiding in his PvP spec and a PvE player doing a BG once in a full moon would be with his raiding spec.
---
Now, the high cost means that even with modern min/maxing mentality going it, you still get *some* of this "you have to pick" gameplay. You can't just be able to do EVERYTHING with a quick, free change of spec.
---
I fully understand why some don't like this, but dual spec did remove both a big RP part of the game as well as a core part of how players interacted with different content. If those things doesn't matter to you, sure - dual spec is great. But really, the "problem" it fixed was not really a problem, it was a feature, a design choice - whether it is a good one is subjective.
---
The REEEEEEEEEEEEEE thing is 4chan incarnate so literally the opposite of a feminist. The video that you posted is a parody... made by 4chan
---
You are the one who questioned the logic of such a decision. "Am I the only one failing to see the logic here?" Indeed you are.
---
Except this is a change that wasnt in vanilla.
---
I bet they won't actually ban anyone for doing this though
---
Classic =/= Vanilla. And I think you missed the point of this video.
---
"What Class Should I Play Wednesday" is tomorrow. Ask in that sticky thread.
---
If it is logical for the warrior to also sell the item, which it is, then that feeds directly into this debate. If you cant see that, then you are the one missing the point.
---
A good mage can smash anyone and anything with their dps. On top of that they can sell food that costs them literally nothing to make, and they sell ports for cash on top of that. They print gold and they have some of the strongest dps in the game. The class isn’t my cup of tea, but they will be dominant from start to finish of classic even when undergeared. If you went warrior or rogue by the time you catch up to where a mage could be at you’ll be broke and have bad gear. Guilds run with 10 mages dps sets man shit is crazy.
---
It's not the druids HP that was impressive, it was his ability to hold aggro over the best DPS on the server.
---
Thanks for the post bud. Didn't know this existed. http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/11784310
---
What he just described has literally nothing to do with knowing the game and everything to do with the server population. You're being intentionally obtuse in order to try and prove your terrible point.
---
I can interact with chinese. I can see them in the world. I can group with them for quest objectives. I can gank them or be ganked by them. For the majority of leveling content it doesn't matter what language people speak. I'll take 3k non english speakers over not seeing a single player in any direction.
---
I wonder if the decision cuts down on their number of tickets by a significant amount saving man hours? Or is it just going to be harder to undo that mechanic?
---
well my Wednesday just got better
---
Yea interacting with gold sellers is always awesome and meaningful gameplay.
---
I probably did. I'm not bashing the video. I'm saying that this WILL happen again in 6 months. There are going to be plenty of terrible clickers and plenty of nelf hunters ganking people lower level than them.

In competitive WSG rogues defend the flag.

In Competitive AB rogues defend a flag and sometimes try to ninja other bases.

I personally enjoy the play style. Its the same as what your role would be in RBGS in retail.

Actually get above level 40.

Also, my guild and a few others broke the economy on a server way back when, I'd love to do it again. 
---
Never knew that was a thing, just found this sub after leaving retail. Thanks

We, 5 old vanilla friends, are going to play 18h/day at launch for a week. We are going to meet personally despite each of us live in different part of Europe.

It is already fun for us as we plan each step to 60. Prestige was never our goal.
---
If edgemasters is better off being sold by the warrior, then forcing him to equip it just because its warrior gear doesn't do anyone any good. The simple fact is this: The warrior "needs" the gold more than he "needs" edgemasters. The warrior "needs" the gold roughly as much as the rest of his party. Therefore, they all need the item equally. 
---
No, it's not. Being able to pug a group for anything at any time of day has a place, the group finder of retail. Classic is supposed to be as close to the original as it can be. Which means, play on your regions servers and find a guild that plays when you do.
---
You've now managed to completely derail the original discussion. Congrats. Ignoring your diversion,

5k connected accounts (regardless of race or humanity) is enough to have a nice Massively Multiplayer experience in the open world and actually see other people around you. 2.5k is not.

Not fuck around and get to 60 ASAP so I can clear MC asap.
---
I'm playing on an undocumented server to test things out and I realize I spent so much leveling time fucking off and doing nothing, and not in a fun way.
---
Yeah that does not sound too bad. Wlock for bigger fights and Rogue for smaller scale I guess
---
I don't really care about having true itemization myself, having items timegated is good enough. I was just throwing out an idea of how it could work. It might be a lot of work but it might be easy to just change the ID's of post change items. Only Blizzard would know much effort it would be :)
---
And the Barrens. Alliance players can heal/buff them to piss off Horde.
---
Same.  I’m hoping to rush to 60 as a Prot Paladin and secure a place in a guild as either an off tank or buff-bot healer.  
---
What others said and ...
---
The biggest complaint comes from the play style. You go long periods of time not engaging anyone between moments of extreme danger because you are likely outnumbered.
---
This bores many. I played Feral for BGs for a long period and it can somewhat the same but as a hybrid I could mix strategies up more. 
---
Rogues are pure specialists. You have to like that game play to enjoy it.
---
Yea, that's essentially what I've been seeing with more and more research. I'd rather play a woryer/rogue due to the melee in your face fighting style, but in the sense of efficiency its almost dumb not going mage. Which I feel like I could still end up really enjoying don't get me wrong. 
---
As battlegrounds are supposed to be "organized" PvP, your role in warsong Gulch is typically defensive, guarding your flag. Same thing in AB, you will typically guard a node. How successful you are at these tasks really just depends on how many enemies are heading your way, and whether or not you yourself have any support. You will have significantly less control over your stun locks on average.
---
AV is a little different given the size and scope of it, what tasks you are trying to accomplish, etc.
---
It's not "bad", just don't expect to blow everyone up with the element of surprise like you would out in the open world.
---
Well if that's the way you play, I wouldn't have you in my raid.  It seems that you're the type of person that finds ways to scam people and use the system for your own gain no matter how it effects other people aka a real scumbag.  Do it once or twice and no one will invite you anymore, so good luck.

1 rogue is good in WSG to camp the flag room
---
they are fine in AB to ninja flags
---
they are good in AV as its more of an open world experience
---
You probably don't want a full premade with more than 2 rogues though
---
My body shouts WORYER, my heart Hunter, my mind Mage and my cock Rogue....
---
For the millionth time the first implementation of loot trading didn't allow need rolled items to be traded.  Therefore we have no idea how the system will work in classic.
---
There were "battle groups" on vanilla. I believe it was only 4 servers linked. Your BG queue was for those 4 servers. 
---
It was still a small enough population thay you knew which guilds were going to be a problem. I remember rolling premades that would just get free wins from everyone leaving immediately.
---
In the many years we’ve had loot trading on live, I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve missed a chance at loot because of this.  The issue isn’t an issue on live.  Why would it be an issue on Classic?
---
Ahh Nothshire Abbey. Fond memories of launch day 2004 on Kilrogg server trying to complete the quests there with sooooo many others; it took forever. But it was so magical.
---
Oh, I missed the point of your post then. Mis-detected sarcasm, sorry.
---
This isn't the podcast that has Tip in it, right? If not, I'll give it a listen.
---
Ooh, what did you do?  I love economy-breaking stories.  
---
4 server battle groups is what it was, they were a whole lot different than what we have now.
---
My personal example, my mage's pre-raid BiS was taken by an elderly healer who misread their pre-raid BiS sheet. Fuck me for trying to help the less-able, amirite?
---
At 1m 17s, the rogue [breaks out of a thorium grenade stun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wewnTYQfdR8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m17s) I think using some item. I know Free Action Potion wasn't used because it prevents, not cures, stuns. Does anybody know what the rogue used?
---
It was a play on the song I smoke two joints
---
"I smoke two joints in the morning
---
I smoke two joint at night
---
I smoke two joint in the afternoon
---
It makes me feel all right"
---
I forgot what the exact joke was but it got removed for that eventually. 
---
He is not in this, thanks for the listen. 
---
Same, I only recently found out this was a thing, and I raided throughout vanilla. I guess my guild was just really good with loot. We never had any problems.
---
Then you don't trade them. That's the whole point and that's the way it should be
---
Don't you know QoL improvements will turn Classic into BfA? /s
---
No the system shouldn't be changed.  
---
R14 gear is OP and generally should be behind a difficulty and investment barrier similar to C'thun, Four horsemen or KT/Sapphiron.  
---
Making it in any way, easier to obtain. Will severely impact the value of raid gear. And generally shortcircuit the gear loop.  
---
The worst thing that happened to gearing in vanilla, was the tbc prepatch, where everybody and their mother had R14 weapons in a day or two.
---
People played on low pop servers with 800 peaks and it was "enough" for them too. But times have changed. Why wouldn't we want the world to feel more alive? As long as it doesn't become a negative thing with fighting for spawns, which IN MY OPINION it won't be at 5k.
---
I feel like every conversation ive been having lately is just classic wow. Im already addicted and I havent played wow in a very very long time. 
---
any ideas if palas use theirs too?
---
More like vanilla will be the downfall of retail players. Lol. They won’t last, but we will. 
---
&gt;I believe there will be a lot higher focus on the endgame come Classic, with a lot more 60s than Vanilla originally had and a lot more of them doing «high end» content such as max level dungeons and raids.
---
Thats a certainty. 
---
I like to have more options, and be able to play more efficiently. Get more shit done, gear faster and most importantly play with people with the same aspirations as me. And being able to form groups easier doesn't make the content easier, as far as I am concerned MC is still completely unpuggable, unless you have 5 premade tier 3 players carrying everyone.
---
I don't know about you, but if I hit 60 pretty early, then quit for a while and I started playing again. And the guilds had suddenly cleared BWL I would not enjoy playing in that guild as much any more because then I am not part of the progression, and I will just end up being carried. So then I would most likely leave that guild, and find another pleb guild that is doing MC progression and get the experience I want, because there are more choices.
---
Or if I want to grind my Cenarion Circle rep on the silithus stones, and I have time to play 1-2 hours a day besides weekend I would like to be able to get at least some progression done without spending 1/2 of the WoW time into forming a group (those windstones are up to 40 man raid bosses btw, and you need to grind A LOT).
---
So unless you already have the perfect guilds set up for your aspiration on a low pop servers, don't assume that everyone else has, and that some people might want a lot more choices to consider for their personal experience and aspirations. High pop does that a lot better than low pop.
---
And as for the friendship part, I guess similar people make better friends so if you have more options to find people with similar aspirations, on your progression tier. That you know are skilled/dedicated or whatever enough that you want to play and spend time with them, then of course you will make good friendships. Which was a non-issue on the high pop servers realms, and I have no idea where this "faceless, nameless" argument comes from, besides maybe people who didn't make it past RFC lvl.
---
You group up constantly for any of content, and if you like to play with the player you chat and keep doing content with them, its that simple.
---
I still remember my little brother crying because his pet ra away do from not being feed 😂
---
I never said it was bad. I said it was a completely different kind of class compared to rogue/mage. As I said trinkets, engineering and consumables in vanilla skyrockets skill from the base class and I mentioned you are talking a lot more keybindings.   Someone looking at playing mage/rogue though probably wouldn't enjoy ret. Conversely someone who enjoys Ret would probably enjoy Enhance Shaman more than Rogue. I completely understand why classes have to be different and why there has to be completely different styles. when they moved away from that I think that is a lot of what killed WoW. It happened for lots of reasons. The failed esport of arena, the lunacy of trying to to turn raiding into a esport. The more tightly tuned you have the more hyper balance required, the more classes have to be similar. I am GLAD they have Vanilla Ret paladin for you and that you enjoy it. In modern WoW all melee might as well be the same. The last melee spec I liked was maybe WoD WW Monk. The last rogue spec I liked was MOP. The last warrior spec I liked was WOTLK and I could go on and on. Keep on hammering and fisting. :)
---
Imma be stealin' this name for my own Woryer.
---
Yeah exactly, I too had 12 R14 Toons back than and cleared Naxx so many times that in the end I had to solo it using only white gear and lvl 8 Dagger to not be bored.
---
So, did you think it was too low, back in vanilla/TBC? Because I never did.
---
Classy do you always dress this well for gaming? lol
---
Being efficient with ny time while still having fun. It is natural since I’ve grown older and my time is more restricted as well as I know am more knowledgeable about the game.
---
Easy fix is to only allow the master looter able to re-assign loot within a time window. This allows fixing of mistakes while avoiding most of the other problems with player-initiated trading
---
The server will slowly die until TBC comes along.
---
Doh, signed up! Thank you sir
---
\#nochanges
---
And my opinion is that old pop cap was good. Game felt and will feel still alive. Your perception might have change and you might not want to play Vanilla as it was anymore but i definetely want. Nothing can change that. 
---
Throwing shade at flying.
---
My man.
---
Nah, he's drunk
---
There's so many problems with this...
---
First of all you're assuming servers will die and people will leave en masse. It's safe to assume some amount of players will try it and leave but you have no idea what the numbers look like. Only Blizzard really knows what to expect, and even they can only guess as this is a new undertaking for them. If this is actually a problem it can be addressed the same way it was always addressed, open free server transfers.
---
Second, I don't see how your initial argument is related to offering varying sizes of server caps or how larger caps are supposed to fix the problem. If you're assuming tons of people will leave and servers will have a "somewhat low playerbase at max level", then how do you know increasing the server pop will actually fix it? 
---
If your initial assumption turns out to be true, then it's reasonable to expect a proportionate amount of people will leave the large servers just as they leave the small servers, leaving it much lower pop than the nostalrius/pserver crowd seems to want. If a server has 10k pop and 4k leave, who decides if that's a dead server? Should server transfer be opened? Won't that just compound the problem and kill a very lively server? Not to mention most servers will probably overcap anyway just as they did in vanilla, so once the hype dies and some players leave, you're left with a high/capped pop server anyway, the only difference is the queue to enter is smaller or non-existent.
---
What if the high cap servers end up not having this problem and now you have 30k people all trying to play on a 10k pop server? It's reasonable to assume that if a higher cap server was an option, then a large majority of the pserver crowd (and even some non-pserver players) will prefer it. These are the exact type of players I would expect to commit and not quit after a few weeks, so it seems like a very possible scenario that it's extremely overcapped and virtually unplayable.
---
Also, I realize this is a slippery-slope argument, but these high-pop pservers mostly operated with changes like dynamic spawns that made it possible to satisfy the large population. I wouldn't be surprised to see people complaining about the lack of spawns and subsequently protesting and asking for dynamic spawns to be implemented. At that point you're just playing a pserver using Blizzard's hardware and we effectively have different types of classic servers, fragmenting the community, development, and support.
---
Finally, your entire argument seems to rest on the statement "Keep in mind what made vanilla private servers so popular was the feeling of playing on a server where there was life."
---
I don't know if you played back in vanilla, but this wasn't a problem for almost every server back in the day and if it was, free server transfers fixed it anyway.
---
So if you're concerned about servers dying, it's already a solved problem. If you're concerned about not getting a pserver experience, then you're on the wrong server.
---
Gotta love that ol' human balding friar hairstyle look.
---
You need to have the 75 riding skill to get the 150 one, you can't "skip".
---
At most you'll save 10g from the actual mount, but yiu need to buy the skill.
---
I used to do that too on XP.  I used to have so many things open at one time back then - WoW, Ventrilo, IE (multiple windows), AIM, MSN Messenger, MS Media Player, Kazaa/Morpheus, etc.
---
Dont forget that you can use the leather later on during the war effort to get mass rep and get exalted with the factions a lot easier.
---
Doesn't really change much. I can't imagine there being such a massive amount of "accidentally looted to wrong person through master looter" tickets that they need to implement a massively not-vanilla change to alleviate it.
---
You're not that squishy.  You have Psychic Scream, PW:S and heals.
---
Nobody stacks 440 defense anymore. Unless your healers are trash it's a non issue. 
---
The aoe grind is typically used to support tailoring and enchant grind from what I see the most from mages.
---
Nono you misunderstood what I meant. You buy the skill for 10g and skip the mount. This is ofc if they go with the old system where mount cost 90g and skill 10. There was a patch in vanilla that switched the price between skill and mount. If they go with this system again there are a few ways you can get a cheaper epic mount.
---
Cool glad we've managed to boil it down to a difference of opinion.
---
Except I had to deal with 3 different people attacking me with ad hominems and straw men before we could get to the point.
---
Hope you find your old friends :)
---
Not many people on my server seemed to pay attention to the Naxx attunement requirements, so for weeks preceding it I bought every arcane crystal on the AH. Made a handy profit selling them in bulk to a couple of the main raiding guilds.
---
Hah holy shit
---
I'll ask the same question each time this comes up:
---
Why do you think loot trading will be a thing, when it wasn't in classic anyway.
---
Until someone shows an interview or a bluepost suggesting they'll have it; shut the fuck up and post memes or something.
---
Stop torrenting things without a vpn.
---
Indeed the leveling process is an adventure. In addition to mobs taking long time to kill with more recovery time in between, actually traversing the world for quests, dungeons and flightpaths takes a load of time. Waiting for boats, mount unlocking at 40, traveling to your trainer every 2 levels for new skills etc, it all adds up.
---
I've been refreshing my memory on a pserver and I really do feel a sense of unironic pride and accomplishment when I get new abilities, new loot from massive quests chains where you go back and forth between zones and 1-2 hour dungeon runs (everyone has to walk to the dungeon, no summoning stones or LFG tool).

**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a DKP-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; **specifically seeking: Shamans &amp; Resto Druids.** Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**
---
The less social can also fill out an application on our Website [http://epochofthought.shivtr.com](http://epochofthought.shivtr.com)  You can also jump on our discord at [https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT)

**Join us!**

Its because you downloaded the torrent without a VPN. Next time you torrent use a VPN, you can still play it. And I think they've sent me like 12-15 of these over the last few years, nothing has come of it. 
---
My mistake, you did not say it was bad. I'm also not a huge fan of Ret, but I did disagree with the statement that it was a class for new players, so thought I'd toss in my 2cp.
---
Don't seed copyrighted stuff. It's illegal. Also this is not the right sub for this.
---
Not everyone is playing day one... someone picks a server and posts it then people join when they start. It takes 1 word on launch morning. I'm certain anyone starting a character can look at discord or whatever before they click create character.
---
I still don't think this is an issue. Some players will maintain high integrity and only roll on something they need. Other players, like you said, will roll need to help out their friend.
---
In the latter instance, if you're a warlock and you join a dungoeon run with a mage and a priest in the same guild, that should be your expectation. They're interest is in each other; they're running dungeons to benefit each other. You can go in with your eyes wide open and know the odds might not be in your favor or you can find  different group or run with only you guild.
---
It's also worth noting that in such a group you should automatically expect both of those other classes to roll on your items -- it's actually a bonus if one of them doesn't need the upgrade.
---
The people against loot trading are looking for a perfect world where everything is always fair and there is unrelenting justice around every corner. The perfect is the enemy of the good in this case.
---
Yes, for me this is more matter of an opinion than objective fact. We agree to disagree on this one. Good luck with all those straw men.
---
How does viewing someone trade loot with friends make it any better? That would just piss me off more watching someone get loot and give to their friend.
---
Yeah Sunken Temple was definitely hell, but in my first BRD run we were completely clueless. We cleared the **entire** first room and just wandered into the uh, beast bosses / coliseum place, and from then on just flabbered about without any idea what we were doing at all, lol. We knew about Thaurissan and tried to find him, but we only got to the doors and couldn't figure out how to open them rofl
---
In fact, I still don't remember, how do you open them? Is it a specific boss' death that causes that?
---
They send these emails out like candy and never do anything about it. You're all good.
---

---
You are throwing around fancy terms like dissonance. But you are failing to make an actual case for why a given member of a party deserves a BoE epic over another person.
---
Any BoE epic can essentially be traded on the AH for one that your class can use. So why does the person who happens to match the class for the item that dropped deserve it more than anyone else?  
---
Especially when you might only see one or two of these items for the entire time you play Vanilla? Now, go.
---
About the worst I have ever seen is one guild using a single alt to buy and resell nearly all useful gear on the AH. This meant that a lvl 28 green with sub optimal stats for any class could sell for 2 gold, while another lvl 28 green with optimal stats may sell for 20+ gold on the AH.
---
They would even buy up an item worth 800 gold if they already had 1-2 of that item selling for 1400 gold (like Edge Master or what ever they are called).
---
It was obvious the guild was willing to spends thousands of gold in order to completely control the AH economy. It doesn't always happen to this extreme though.

I think he alludes to the fact that WoW was always designed as a casual MMO, and designers always favoured simplicity and quality of life over hardcore elitism.
---
Of course keeping in mind that hardcore MMOs of the time were way, way more hardcore than what we see today.
---
Omegalul
---
That is not how this works. He made the assertion with no evidence. It's not my job to find evidence against the data he made up. It's up to him to have evidence. Its the most basic rule of logic.
---
I agree it won't be full blown progresisve itemization, but does it mean that the updated/added items in 1.10 will not exist until Phase 5?
---
Does this mean that aside the few epic quality items that are world BoE's added after 1.10, most "good" blue items added in 1.10 from say Baron or Darkmaster Gandling will be missing many of their items? They also posted in that thread that "many items that will not have a greater impact will be unchanged" What is there definition of greater impact? 
---
So many questions...
---
&gt;You might find yourself in for a rude awakening when you roll need on a boe purple and get kicked from your group or find the "drama you so avidly tried to avoid", still exists regardless of your imaginary ruleset you have.
---
You might find yourself in a rude awakening when everyone except you rolls need on a BoE purple.   
---
This is how it was in Vanilla, it is how it will be in Classic. All roll need on expensive BoE's. Period. 
---
Cuz then you could spam trade chat for ninja looters?
---
Isn't that literally the only issue anyways?
---
They won't though.
---
It sounds more like a buffer is needed in order to alleviate loot being distributed wrong or ninja occurring because parties can conspire with each other. Has something in-between ever been tried? 
---
All I wanted when I was a teenager in Vanilla was for my drood to have the werebear and werewolf forms from the Diablo 2 druid.
---
So many false expectations. 
---
Screw epic mount. You will use the money to buy your BiS items, just like edgemaster's is to the warrior. Does the warrior need edgemaster's more than the rogue needs Devilsaur? Hell no. 
---
The people who frequent this subreddit are a fraction of the Classic WoW playerbase. The percentage of people who care about fear ward is a fraction of this subreddit.
---
Worth adding, I'm currenty planning to roll a dwarf priest, haha (unless my guild goes Horde).
---
Asking him to show evidence of something that common is not reasonable, most polls show TBC as higher in popularity. I won't find it for you because that won't make it more true, it will just make you dodge the poll data.
---
Stereotypical min maxer aggressiveness towards casuals.  Lol
---
Pretty simple. Disenchanting/Vendoring loot drastically lowers the value the item provides. Whereas selling something rare on the AH can be worth 1000s of gold. Its just a cost/reward thing and it is simple to figure out. I am sure you can tell the difference.
---
LOL i have multiple memories of doing BRD and finally getting to the Emperor and feeling a HUGE relief. Like holy fuck we need to kill this fucker now because I have been in this instance too damn long. I also remember wiping to him and having the group just disintegrate at that point.
---
I still love the place and have run it an ungodly amount of times.
---
I wanted to this but then i realized my server was bad and only 1 guild of my faction ever set foot inside lol
---
Hey there.  Check us out below, Epoch of Thought.  Would love to chat with you sometime soon on discord.
---
Economy wise, not much out of the ordinary.
---
But we did have a [different unique precedent](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Magtheridon_US) that is rather famous still to this day...
---
My usual quote (TL/DR: Original cap is plenty. More is bad.):
---
"A higher population doesn't equal to more social interaction. You have tons of players around in todays retail WoW, still everyone is playing for themselves. Because they're not depended on each other. Same principle applies to the world of vanilla. The fewer players are around, the harder do quests get. And the harsher and unforgiving does traversing hostile locations become. Because of this, you really start to appreciate the company of other players.
---
I've played plenty of pre-Cata retail and p-servers with blizzlike caps. Of course it is harder to build a group for specific quests if players aren't just presented to you due to overcrowding. Just waiting for another player close to an elite creature could be very well pointless for hours. But it was this exact reason why my friend list was full of people of my level. So we could contact each other in case of group quests. I was changing zones to help them and they did to help me. Somtimes we even re-did pre-quests together which one side has already completed, so that we both could profit from the task. And it was this adventures and challenges that lead to getting to know each other and to forming friendships.
---
In contrast to this, having too many players around is - for a start - diminishing roleplaying aspects like world building and immersion. I.e. locations loosing their dangerous atmosphere and meaning, due to always having players around steamrolling enemy ranks. So places with a story and certain peculiarities, that you might have struggled with and created memories from, simply turn into just another grinding spot. Plastered with NPC corpses and people farming. More alive, sure. But no longer as authentic, vast and scary.
---
Every zone in the game is more challenging and dangerous if you're approaching it alone. Not pulling too many mobs in buildings/caves, fighting your way in and back out alive from enemy territory, keeping an eye on your cooldowns and HP/mana, not letting them run off into another group when they're low on health. What made vanilla great for many people is trying to survive in this world on their own. Attempting every quest alone, and either improving and succeeding. Or realizing that some task are too much for a sole adventurer. That you're not supposed to do this alone. All of this gets negated and obsolete if you have so many players around that you can just make your way through a cleared path right to the quest target. And if there's no incentive to group up with other people other than being able to tag the mob.
---
Having too many players also can lead to competition, where you start to disparage the presence of other players. Because they're killing your quest mobs and looting your quest items. Just going to the spawn of an elite mob and joining random players by typing "Inv" to quickly kill it doesn't lead to forming bonds. No, this can entirely happen without anyone exchanging a word or emote. But having to actively build that group in town, traveling to your target location together, fighting your way to the elite, maybe even wiping in the process, and finally killing him, did. This is where my most memorable pre-Cata moments come from. Failing a quest over and over, therefore seeking someone who could help me. Finding that person, doing the quest, maybe even fail together. Become friends in the process.

Retail Pre-Cata: Me and a friend slowly fighting our way into a scourge base, having to fight our way past zombies and monsters. It did feel like an adventure, because the scourge hordes were dense and one mistake could mean the end of us. No one was hustling or competing with us. It was up to us to infiltrate the base and make it to our target. When we finally arrived at the elite creature, we attempted to kill that thing 5 times. We died, but we tried again. We improved our gameplay. We read into the quest text more and spotted something helpful that we missed. And then we finally did it. It felt epic. It was rewarding.
---
P-Server with non-blizzlike population: Me and a friend go into a scourge base. It's already full of players farming and there are hardly any mobs around. Getting to the elite mob is no problem at all. The elite is dead, there are 3 people waiting for the respawn. We type "Inv" into /say, get invited. We wait until the mob spawns. We kill him in no time. One guy says thanks, everyone immediately leaves the group and we head to our next quest. Not epic. Not rewarding.
---
I've played plenty on &lt;redacted&gt; PvP with their concurrent player count being exactly at 5k. And sure, there are tons of players around and you're joining groups frequently. But it is a lot less personal than it used to be in vanilla retail. And not as rewarding if you don't actively build the groups yourself. The world most certainly feels more alive, but it also feels a lot smaller and cramped. Also non-existent world PvE challenge, broken roleplaying immersion, competing and rushing with other players for quest mobs/targets, joining and leaving groups becomes an unpersonal routine. It's almost like people are just playing for the population hype and not for the game itself."
---
Anyone formerly of the Sha'tar behind this?
---
We want to make sure that if we're getting really invested in the game that it will have a life beyond what we've already seen
---
&gt;  We all know that many of the R14 people and full time pvpers are on government/parent benefits
---
Man don't ever say "We all know" and associate me with some bullshit like this again.
---
* Maybe they are school kids skipping class. 
---
* Maybe, because its summer time, its school kids with no class.
---
* Maybe its people who have enough passive income to enjoy life on.
---
* Maybe their work/business is so non-strenuous that they can take a few weeks off at a time to be no-lifers and get R14.
---
* Maybe they are disabled and a 9-5 job is out of the question.
---
* Maybe they have a spouse who makes so much money that the other can stay at home.
---
What "we all know" is that it takes a long time to reach R14. Let those people live their best life.
---
Mages are undisputed Kings of large scale PvP. Nothing else can even compare.
---
So unless you plan on playing mage don't worry about it.
---
This is just what i ment.
---
This was on a private server, but a guildie got the first lionheart helm pattern and made a killing.  He bought any lionheart pattern that dropped from then on and vendored them so he could maintain his monopoly.
---
&gt;I doubt BoP trading abuse is going to be more common than BoE or unbound drops
---
Yeah you just lost all credibility. I still remember the day they added LFG to WOTLK and I would ninja the blues/epics from dungeons so I could get free DEs and not let anyone roll on my shards. Going to be the same thing with BoPs if loot trading is allowed, I guarantee you I'm going to roll need on it for a buddy if I'm in a group of friends with a rando or two. 
---
Is there potential for BoE abuse? Absolutely. Does having loot trading fix it? Absolutely not (b/c news flash it's already tradable). Especially not making everyone BoP and unfun, that's quite objectively the worst suggestion. You are effectively trying to remove an entire system from the game by saying you KNOW people will abuse the heck out of it and it won't be fun. Except, we have had BoEs since the beginning of Classic and the amount of abuse is negligible, most people still really enjoy this system you are advocating to remove. It's honestly asinine.
---
We all had gathering/mining and the like. We stocked up on everything, bought out the AH and sold it all for more. 
---
We did this for about a month, driving up prices, and stockpiling all the mats, selling them one stack at a time, then doubling the price after selling them. There were four guilds doing this in unison, buying any that were sold under our prices and reselling for way higher. A stack of copper went for 15gold by then end, and the higher ones were way more. 
---
Then when our inventories and Banks were full, we had over 1k gold each person, and we couldn't keep it up, we dropped everything down to 1 gold per stack.  Everything. 
---
It got so bad then that we heard rumors of a server reset or merger. 
---
Nothing was worth anything for at least six months. 
---
If you dont get it maybe you shouldn't offer up what you think is a solution.  Just dont allow loot trading and let people suffer the consequence of misclicking or add a confirmation button if its really that hard for people to do.
---
So your example..... you think these three people are going to stumble upon the server blade and then just let the server admin have it because he can use it beyond it's monetary value? Maybe if he pays them for the money he gets from doing so. In reality, they would sell it and split the money, or the server admin could pay the other two 1/3 of the value each to take it off their hands. That is how the world works. I think you kinda shot yourself in the foot with that one.
---
Yes, some dungeons were straight up confusing. WC, Maraudon, ST, and BRD being standouts. There's just no way you would have a clue being a group of noobs wandering into them.
---
The only way to learn them was from repetition and experience mattered A LOT in those instances.
---
It was a typo, the point is people know the game better so the population will min-max more.
---
And for the population, even if its 100k doesn't mean that you can't see or recognize  the same mage selling his overpriced lvl 55 water on the orgr mailbox everyday. Or do people really believe that they will interact/know 1000 people on their server?
---
Maybe we should reduce the cap to 600 and 300 per faction to really have tight knit community.
---
That is not nearly as simple as "All roll need on expensive BoE".
---
Is there any source it was 4? I believe our Battlegroup was a lot bigger (Blackout in EU). It wasn't as big as all servers in a region linked though, thats for sure. 
---
The first thing I thought of when reading the news update yesterday was Countdown to Classic and how excited I was to listen to your episode about it. Knew it was coming. Always great to be able to rely on you to stay on top of things. I skimmed the blue post because I knew you and your guests would explain it thoroughly. You didn't disappoint! Love your podcast, Josh. 
---
&gt;If you dont get it maybe you shouldn't offer up what you think is a solution.
---
Explain it then.
---
&gt;Just dont allow loot trading and let people suffer the consequence of misclicking or add a confirmation button if its really that hard for people to do.
---
Why? Cuz then won't do that anyway cuz they will just a make a ticket, cry to blizzard and then they will have to manually (probably) fix it themselves, which directly leads into loot trading. So why not just leave loot trading in the game?
---
Warlock for sure. They scale better than other classes (by Naxx you literally can't lose a 1v1 if you try). The 1v1 potential alone is worth playing them, but as far as leveling, farming, bging, and questing goes, all those things are going to be a lot easier and more chill as a warlock.
---
&gt;And only have it tradable while still in the dungeon, set the cap to like 5 minutes after its looted AND have those items be visible in the chat when traded.
---
So the scenario is this. 5 man dungeon. Tank, Healer, and a DPS are in the same guild. The other DPS were pugged. An item drops that appeals to the healer and one of the pugged DPS.
---
Under Blizzard's current proposal AND yours, what is to stop the Tank and Guild DPS from rolling need on that item, then having 5 minutes or two hours to immediately trade it to the healer? So what if it is made public in chat - the damage is done.
---
&gt;I am 100% in agreement with Blizzard here if they were to implement the change I propose 
---
LOL what? "I agree totally if Blizzard does what I say they should do." lmao
---
For random BGs either is fine. But if you're looking to rank up then it's a problem because most premades bring 1 or 0  rogues with them. And the one they do bring has to be a damn good rogue. 
---
Rolling an elemental shaman instead of picking a druid, mostly.
---
Nothing particularly different aside having experience of hindsight and actual in game goals to achieve rather than just playing without rhyme or reason.
---
Trying to control the market like that usually backfires horribly and ends quickly because of lack of profit. More gear with desirable stats will be generated than people are willing to pay at such extremely high price points. Suddenly all the lowbie levelers that one would think are being oppressed by this guild are now filthy rich because they keep listing every decent green they get for 10-15g and laughing all the way to the bank while the monopolist buys it for 20g and then fails to sell most of the gear.
---
I now read this posts in your voice.
---
I guess I sent the wrong message, let me clear this up. I am not a hardcore gamer, rather I am a person who wants to lvl with people nice and slow all the way to 60 and if I never see AQ40 or Naxx so be it. But having a dead server because „tourists“ left at lvl20 is just bad and IMHO a paywall would prevent this.
---
can someone explain why rockbiter is better for 2h weapons?

Ha, that’s great. 
---
But £600 early to mid 2005
---
Thanks so much for the very kind words, I hope the show keeps living up to those expectations! Will do my best :)
---
Thanks guys. One thing I hated about bear tanking is the awful aoe tanking + always being rage starved before the swipe buff. That buff didn’t occur until cata iirc. If bear tanking is much the same crap before the buff I might reconsider to warrior instead.
---
G’Day ;)
---
99% sure they eat fish, had a hunter toon back in a day and i used to feed my bear with fish and crab meat when low on cash
---
You're not the only person that wished Hurricane was like the Diablo version. Lol
---
Hurricane and Tranquility are both very underwhelming spells unfortunately.  I literally have to make up excuses to use Tranq ever.  Barkskin + Hurricane for farming could have been a much more interesting experience.
---
Beeing fast and realize you dinged 60, but still has to wait for enough people to ding so you can do instances. Yeah rushing is a fun endgame experiance
---
&gt;So the scenario is this. 5 man dungeon. Tank, Healer, and a DPS are in the same guild. The other DPS were pugged. An item drops that appeals to the healer and one of the pugged DPS.

Hmm, let me think. How about crying in trade-chat and gutting that guilds reputation? Taking screen-shots and posting it on forums so people will boycot them?
---
Thats the best you can do about it. 
---
&gt;LOL what? "I agree totally if Blizzard does what I say they should do." lmao
---
Cuz its a fix to the "crazy ninja looting issue".
---
I heard it was 2500 at the start of classic and 4000 by the end of it.
---
Meet in the middle at 3250?
---
&gt; This isn't really about min max. If you don't have dwarf priests in raid you fucking wipe most of the time
---
Sheesh, your raid groups must really suck.
---
It was bigger but it was also so long ago. 
---
Don't want to put my time into something ephemeral.
---
Thanks man! Ya I keep flipping back and forth... trying to figure out what's best for a casual.
---
No, I made a typo. I meant in regards to fighting over resources. Meaning that many pservers DON'T have players fighting over resources and have dynamic respawns allowing people to gather many more nodes whether in quests or in resources than you would ever have been able to without real competition in Retail Vanilla. Not all pservers were like this, such as Rebirth but most others really seem to be and a lot of people are all for it so they can have their 5k+ servers, but the game totally wasn't built for that and it ruins the economy.
---
&gt;Why? they w won't "suffer the consequences" anyways, because they will just a make a ticket, cry to blizzard and then Blizzard will manually (probably) fix it. 
---
That's the point, no tickets and no trading.  It's the responsibility lies on the shoulders of the ML alone.  That's why they were put in that position to begin with.
---
&gt;I really really don't get the issue.
---
I would rather see no system than an exploitable band-aid fix that's in a corporations best interest.
---
Viable.
---
Factually not as effective as a warrior until Naxx and even then it's debatable.
---
But definitely viable. I expect there will be guilds running Bears in Classic. 
---
Go check the warlock classic discord, you have everything there 
---
The rush is because vanilla will only last for X time. If it took them so long to do vanilla, one could assume TBC (or whatever comes next) could take at least as much time. Better to push for what comes after now, then to wait until it's time for it to happen and THEN have to wait another 2-3 years.
---
But...isn't that Vanilla?
---
If they doubled the limit to 32, that would open up a lot of performance for several classes, such as affliction warlocks.
---
If making the debuff limit 32 would violate \#nochanges, doesn't making it 16 do the same?
---
Also some epic gear is a lot harder to fool people with loot trading antics. If it’s some blue, the person will win and probably be done with the dungeon before 2 hours, but the winner of an epic from a raid is a regular in a pug, or a guildie, who obviously doesn’t have the item he won the next few days/weeks.
---
lol. What's the deal with Tip?
---
&gt; by Naxx you literally can't lose a 1v1 if you try
---
Except against things with an offensive dispel
---
&gt; I like to have more options, and be able to play more efficiently. Get more shit done, gear faster and most importantly play with people with the same aspirations as me.
---
I guess that's where we differ. Gearing and plowing through the content faster than "designed" by increasing the population feels wrong to me. Something I don't understand is why many of you call it "low pop" when it could just as well be called "original pop". We both agree there will be a much higher focus on the endgame this time around, which in turn will make it much easier to find a group doing that content compared to how it was in Vanilla.
---
&gt; I guess similar people make better friends so if you have more options to find people with similar aspirations, on your progression tier. That you know are skilled/dedicated or whatever enough that you want to play and spend time with them, then of course you will make good friendships.
---
I will try not repeating myself too much here, but as I mentioned above - in my opinion - what makes a healthy community is surrounding yourself not only with like-minded people, but people with different goals, backgrounds and opinions. 
---
Very basic &amp; stupid example: Let's say you're a Chad. On a realm with 10k pop there might be a 100 Chads, while on a 2,5k pop realm there would be 25 Chads. Now you're more or less forced to interact with not only Chads, but other people as well, which I think is a good thing.
---
However, I don't think we'll end up agreeing no matter how much we discuss this topic in to the ground, so do you think different sized realms should be a thing? Some originally sized, and some massive ones?
---
Server transfers might've been 1.9. I really don't remember the detials for that one, but it was a bit prior to cross-realm BG's. [Cross-realm BG's were 1.12 for sure though.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0)
---
&gt;That's the point, no tickets and no trading. It's the responsibility lies on the shoulders of the ML alone. That's why they were put in that position to begin with.
---
Except that blizzard re-distributed the items anyways via ticket, so what difference does it make? Its just a cog in Blizzard's system and a nuissance.
---
If it was like no mercy, you gave the item to that person so he is going to keep it, I would agree. But thats not how they operate.
---
&gt;I would rather see no system than an exploitable band-aid fix that's in a corporations best interest.
---
Its also in my interest if I bid 200dkp on the staff from Nefarian and ML accidentally gave it to the off-tank. Then I could get the staff immediately back from the off-tank instead of waiting 2 days for the tickets to go through.
---
Orgrimmar rep can be gained through Alterac Valley so I would focus on the more-lacking factions like Darkspear Trolls, Thunderbluff, and Undercity.
---
I think everyone is getting lost in the weeds arguing on how to implement loot trading. Blizzard just need to implement "return loot to corpse" as an undo button.  Loot returned is rerolled or master looted again.
---
It solves the same GM problem without the potential abuse of loot trading. Even in 5 man and rolling on loot, there is no way to influence where the loot goes if you force a reroll every time it goes back to the corpse.
---
Soo, opinion and "feelz" with no real metrics and statistics.
---
Gotcha.
---
We had Babyface on Magtheridon doing this.  I always wondered how much gold that guy had.  I'd say 35% of all AH items belonged to this guy.
---
Again you don't seem to understanding. If it were "common", though I think that isn't the word you want, then evidence would be abundant. But as you and others can't even find something close to backing up this wild claim, its hard to be swayed by your argument.
---
I have a friend who was rank 14 as a gnome rogue back in old Vanilla, so you can definitely do well as one! I have never played one myself in BGs, so don't have any first-hand experience unfortunately

Ya I typically farm rank 3 when playing Alliance there.
---
A bunch of Horde running around 8 levels below me. JUICY!
---
Wind Serpent probably the most under-rated pet for pvp. 
---
Please. No loot trading
---
Are you talking about in vanilla or on live?   If you're correct, then how does TSM's desktop agent feed auction data to the internal TSM addon then?
---
But the whole point is if he’s going to be a casual he won’t benefit from how hard they scale.
---
If you have BG's as the priority over World PVP? Play the Lock. Rogues are really only needed or do something better than other classes in one BG where you sit on a druid flag carrier in a premade. If you want to lead dmg or kills (outside of playing horrible pugs) play another class. 
---
As far as "big fights". You aren't dmg on a rogue. You try to pick off people behind the battles, people drinking, people running to ear. I have led kills/kblows in a AV on a rogue (and honestly you are supposed to be trying to take towers with some druids), but if you can do that you can literally triple that number on something like a hunter or ele shaman in that AV. Locks often miss out on the kblow but they pump damage.
---
If you had WPVP as the priority over BG I would say rogue. Not because Lock is bad at it, or in any 1 v 1 matchup, but because when you die on a rogue, it's not a big deal. Locks have to summon, stones to be back in the game.
---
For the other parts of your list they are both good at all that, but rogues probably have the hardest time getting in a pre raid dungeon. Not because they are bad at damage. They are in fact exceptional. It's simply because the warriors are after the same gear usually (fury). If you are a social person in a guild this isn't a problem. More of a lone wolf? Big problem. Just getting the gear to raid could be tough and you are going to have lots of competition.
---
Lets just say at a certain point grave moss was selling at 50g each on my realm.
---
I love how this sub went from #nochanges to demanding sharding. To many r/wow people came here I suppose. 
---
You forgot what you were responding to, didn't you. 
---
Reminder: It was about servers where this didn't happen
---
Probably because a lot of people have already replayed Vanilla a lot of times on various servers that I won't mention here. So they want to know that it won't just be the same as those servers, where the server progresses through the old raid content and then the population falls off. 
---
With Full Naxx gear, I would go Shaman. For early/mid game experience, I would go Lock. 
---
I agree I think most of his stuff is actually pretty good and people give him unwarranted shit...it's honestly absolutely insane.
---
better than fighting 30 people for those 5 zombie spawnpoints with 5 min respawn time, for a chance at a quest item with 20% drop chance..
---
I VERY vividly remember bear druids being virtually useless tanking raids in vanilla. We had one decked out in BWL stam/armor/+def gear and the most we let him actually tank was ZG because even there he was getting crushed. A lot of people will say they are good enough to tank raid content but you have to remember, this is almost exclusively from experience on modded servers. It's not going to be the same on a live server. They may very well be great tanks. Time will tell. I wouldn't put all my eggs in that basket though.
---
&gt;Except that blizzard re-distributed the items anyways via ticket, so what difference does it make? Its just a cog in Blizzard's system and a nuissance.
---
You're fundamentally misunderstanding this part.  No tickets, zero tickets.  No loot trading, zero loot trading.
---
&gt;Its also in my interest if I bid 200dkp on the staff from Nefarian and ML accidentally gave it to the off-tank.
---
Tough luck man, you gave that responsibility to the ML so deal with the issue amongst yourselves within the guild.  You'll be needing to run some more Nef for that staff.
---
I went Alliance my first time through, this time I’m going with the new adventure mindset. I was a gnome mage, this time thinking Undead Warlock or Tauren Warrior. I want to see everything i missed last time! 
---
Please do Mulgore!!!
---
There was one dude who constantly had all the best blue gear (max level and leveling gear) and tried to sell it at about 3 times the normal price, spamming a ton of awesome items probably once every 15 minutes for most of everyday. People speculated that he had tens of thousands of gold, but he was an enchanter and would charge reasonable prices for enchants and would even do the lower level stuff too, but he'd hassle you if you were slightly slow finding your item or handing over the enchanting mats. It was a medium pop server at peek hours, so people probably had to break down and buy from him more than they'd like because their item didn't come up that often. I never thought of it, but he'd've probably bought any blues and saved me the AH fee if I asked.
---
my first memory from Hillsbrad was crossing that border just exploring on my Undead Rogue. I saw the "Contested Zone" popup and thought "cool". Then I was immediately ganked by some higher level alliance. It was a fun trial by fire in those days and you learned to keep your head on a swivel.
---
I only had a couple of Naxx drops by the time Vanilla ended but I did PVP as a ret paladin and I can tell you that nothing in Vanilla was more satisfying than seeing people run away from a Paladin.
---
What the fuck?
---
The dude was literally called a "dickhead" completely unprovoked, and they are the aggressive one?
---
Anyway, it's fucking sad to see people excuse being a dick under "hurr durr I'm just a casual"
---
You're starting to sound like my experience with Dark Souls.  Lol
---
Yep.  In every private server, the player-base vanishes some months into Naxxramas.  In official games, the player-base vanishes after extended content droughts.
---
They're fixing a lot of bugs but it is inevitable there will still be bugs. There are random locations you can fall into the ground, for example. Lol
---
&gt;Cuz its a fix to the "crazy ninja looting issue".
---
Please explain, in detail, how your original proposal fixes the scenario that I gave you.
---
&gt; Hmm, let me think. How about crying in trade-chat and gutting that guilds reputation? Taking screen-shots and posting it on forums so people won't play with them?
---
If crying in /2 is your solution, then what's the difference between your solution and the current proposed one? Why does changing the timer to 5 minutes (down from 2hr) and making a chat message fix the problem of group ninja looting?  That's exactly what's going to happen. It won't be effective, but it will happen.
---
Oh, and don't forget: friends (IRL or in game) can do this without being in the same guild.
---
I think the most important part to this comment should be amended to "private servers don't stack 440 defense anymore."  There are mechanical issues that private servers were never able to get right by the admission of their own designer.  Coefficients, resistances, abilities simply were not known for many things.  Often time, it was the best educated guess of the pserver developers, and some times they just didn't try to copy vanilla.  As it stands, Classic will not be a re-release of what is already going on during private servers.   I will be shocked if you see main tanks not trying their darndest to get to 440 as reasonably as they can.  The math of it is just too critical for fights.  We all gain 5 defense per level so that defense on a level 60  character without any attribute or gear is 300.  Critical hit immunity comes at 440.  Critical hits deal 2x damage, and is based on the difference between the attacker weapon skill and the player defense.  Mobs at base have a 5% chance of crit plus 0.2% times the level difference, meaning a boss has a 5.6% chance of a critical strike.  Each point of defense lowers the crit % by 0.04%, so 0.04% x 140 added defense covers that 5.6%.  After this, you look at dodge, perry, and block to push crushing blows off the table. A crushing blow is 150% of damage.  Crushing blow cannot not be avoided by "maxing" defense at 440 (that is for critical strikes; CB is based on base defense, or probably better worded as the difference between base defense and attack).   An attack has a chance chance to miss, to be dodged, to be parried, to be blocked, to be a glancing blow, to be a critical (which we have removed with 440 defense), and to be a crushing blow.  Dodge, perry and block are absolute %s...what you see is what you get.  The boss will also miss 5% os the time.  If the total combined chance of a miss, dodge, parry, or block is 100% or higher, not only can the attack not be an ordinary hit, the attack also cannot be a crit or a crushing blow.  Until late game Naxx, you  will not have people exceeding the 100% cap rate, and they are thus reliant on removing critical strikes and minimizing crushing blows.  But, druids will never reach this cap because block and perry are such a major component of pushing crushing blocks off the table.  A druid would need 95% dodge to avoid crushing blows, which I will go on a limb and say is impossible.  I know a great druid can tank well, and they can do it better than a bad warrior.  But, a decent warrior is just going to always be move viable in Classic.

1. Fury Warrior

2. Yes
---
3. No
---
If you have a decent shield, you do not need to stress about having mostly chain items for a while. There are some late 30s blue chain items that have better AC than early 40s green plate.
---
oh... thats good. Thank  you. 
---
It meant I couldn't ever raid on my priest (nobody would ever ever invite a pvp geared spriest) and I would suffer heavily pvping on my rogue. As a pvper I wanted my opponents to be pvp specced and as a raider I wanted my allies to be pve specced. The RP perspective was irrelevant because some people would spend 100g a week doing both, which would allow them to bypass the 'feature'.
---
He started off by swearing at him, so you could call him a dickhead just for that I suppose.  Not much more justification needed.
---
He accused him of having a personal desire to be lazy and/or carried because he wants to "look at nelf ass."  How do you not think that's rude, unfounded assumption and not passive aggressive?  Lol seriously 
---
Then he founded his rude argument on being arbitrarily "beyond the realm of "min max"" like that's not a bogus remark.
---
He's surprised he got a rise out of someone?  I'm not.

Christmas during the WoW years was really weird.
---
My family would always go overboard with gifts for Christmas and birthdays.  Yet during vanilla, I remember pulling all nighters in WoW and being more excited for the WoW presents and having the day off than the actual holiday in real life.  
---
I have a very distinct memory of Christmas 2004.  I stayed up all night leveling my first warrior.  I was up in the Grimtotem bluffs in Thousand Needles as the sun rose in game and in real life.  It was a simple thing, but memorable. 
---
And this is it - one of the key social dynamics was reputation. Get the rep of a Ninja and you basically had to change server to get into a PUG. People actually cared what other people thought of them, you had to, like, talk to other people,  compare to what you have in pug raids now... it's like being in a bubble. 
---
&gt;Gearing and plowing through the content faster than "designed" by increasing the population feels wrong to me.
---
Its only the downtime between when you are doing the content, I would assume you spend just as much if not more in doing the actualy conent. Doing 500 stratholme runs for the perfect rng stats probably wasn't a common thing on retail vanilla.
---
Its more efficient game-time, but I guess faster "IRL" time, as you don't co-ordinate everything or have specified times to do content. So its more dynamically which fits my schedule a lot better.
---
&gt;Something I don't understand is why many of you call it "low pop" when it could just as well be called "original pop".
---
Because pretty much all the vanilla pservers and even TBC/wrath servers have been at a relatively high population compared to what it was blizzlike, and its what people have grown accustomed to.
---
I think vanilla just feels much more cohesive and fluent on a higher pop server, its easier to get shit done all the time, and there is always people everywhere, always something happening. And with a lower pop down to 3k I feel it will stagnate a lot. 
---
So in comparison, I think the "world" would be more "dead" or calm. Which I don't really like, personally.
---
&gt;what makes a healthy community is surrounding yourself not only with like-minded people, but people with different goals, backgrounds and opinions.
---
Well, I think its kinda obnoxious if lets say I want to raid hardcore, but my guild wants to slack. Or the other way around. Having to adapt to the collective isn't necessarily fun, oh I want to do stratholme but I have to do it with my guildies who doesn't have time until Friday etc. Thats not fun for me, so I like to keep it more flexible. 
---
Also just because I am in a guild which is hardcore or semi-hardcore or whatever doesn't mean I am exactly as everyone in that guild, just similar on that specific area on how much effort I want to invest in the game. 
---
Like some common interest/dedication or skill or whatever factor is important if you want to get along with people, and with more players the more options you have from people to play with.
---
&gt;Very basic &amp; stupid example: Let's say you're a Chad. On a realm with 10k pop there might be a 100 Chads, while on a 2,5k pop realm there would be 25 Chads. Now you're more or less forced to interact with not only Chads, but other people as well, which I think is a good thing.
---
But isn't that more common with pugging? If you have a raid guild but you do tons of other content with randoms from the world chat forming groups, as oppose to only playing with your inner circle.
---
&gt;Very basic &amp; stupid example: Let's say you're a Chad. On a realm
---
&gt;However, I don't think we'll end up agreeing no matter how much we discuss this topic in to the ground, so do you think different sized realms should be a thing? Some originally sized, and some massive ones?
---
I wouldn't mind if they had different pop servers, that would favor everyone. But I would really like them to have huge pop servers as an option even tho it wasn't blizzlike, as it has been proven to be a popular preference among people who have been playing vanilla servers for years.
---
I don't play retail so I really don't know. They may have added some support for this in more recently APIs. Does the addon require you to reload your UI in order to sync data with the desktop application?
---
nah save your gold. there are always more drops. buy bags if you need them &amp; save for your epic mount
---
Lmao, why the fuck would he vendor them? He could'a just waited and sold them later.
---
Well druid threat is higher than warrior.
---
ClassicDB seems to be popular. And the folks over at classicwow.live are also working on a database.
---
congratz on being a douche
---
I'm not sure i follow, you're saying that back in the day, if you lost the roll for some item that dropped in a raid, the masterlooter of the raid (rightfully) gives it to the winner, you could then make a ticket claiming the one who got it didn't actually win the roll and it was a mistake that it was given to him, and the GM would just take the item from that guy and give it to you? If that's what you're saying, it's completely wrong as the GMs would always ask the guy who wrongly got the item directly in whispers if it was indeed a mistake, and only if he agreed would they consider fixing the problem, and it was in my experience rare that GMs obliged these kinds of requests. But if i'm misunderstanding what you meant then my bad. 
---
&gt;Please explain, in detail, how your original proposal fixes the scenario that I gave you.
---
I mean, unless you want them to get banned from WoW or go to jail IRL, thats as good of a solution you can get. If a guild gets a bad rep it will hurt their possibilities to to content without guild/friend pre-made groups, and the consequence they get from stealing your item even tho you don't get it back.
---
Or maybe you would rather prefer Blizzard taking the item back, giving it to you (as the rightful owner) and then banning both of them for theft.
---
&gt;If crying in /2 is your solution, then what's the difference between your solution and the current proposed one? Why does changing the timer to 5 minutes (down from 2hr) and making a chat message fix the problem of group ninja looting? That's exactly what's going to happen. It won't be effective, but it will happen.
---
So you can stay in the grp and see if they trade it, just so you save some time as oppose to waiting 2 hours after the final boss is dead, you just have to wait 5.
---
&gt;Oh, and don't forget: friends (IRL or in game) can do this without being in the same guild.
---
Doesn't matter if they are in the same guild if you can see them trading the item.
---
Disagree with trading loot. It messes with whole concept of loot being reward from bosses especially if you fill in spot with almost full guild group, they will have more chances to gear up specific player or just rip you off upgrade for a guild bank shard. 
---
Solution i propose : add extra confirmation to need option and roll with it as it should have been. Sometimes it's just pure luck to win upgrade (looking at you dpser's).
---
They're a new sub-race of humans. We traveled to Kul Tiras in BfA, and Blizzard took this chance to basically give humans some more customization. Kul Tiras is made up of these big guys, regular humans and really skinny ones (based on the undead female rig). Due to gameplay reason only the fat ones are playable (other than regular humans of course), but not all Kul'Tirans look like this.
---
There is also some kind of lore explanation for them being so big, something to do with their ancestors, but I'm not really sure about it, because I didn't level an alliance toon in BfA.
---
Saying private servers aren't 100% accurate does nothing to prove your point. Maybe bosses don't hit hard enough or maybe it's the reverse and they are hitting even harder than they should..
---
Crits or crushing blows it doesn't matter cause you have 3-5 healers just spamming the tank with heals the whole time.
---
I actully had to look this up, almost fell out of my chair reading that the first cordless mouse was invented 1991(!!). Holy shit, many years before my families first ever pc. 
---
He’s a poser that only regurgitates information he finds here or official updates, not having really played original but gallivanting as if he had. He contributes nothing to the community and is a hypocrite, staunchly advocating against Right Click Reporting because “assholes will abuse it,” meanwhile doing that very thing during the demo duel tournament. I suppose he was right. 
---
People didn't know how to properly gear a bear in vanilla too. For example you said your bear stacked def gear but def gear aren't actually good.
---
I think Taladril has done the most research on this topic.
---
[https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/)
---
To summarize: they make great offtanks, but their capability relative to warriors drops off as you progress. Excellent single target threat - but poorer mitigation. Better DPS when offtanking than a fury warrior in tanking gear.
---
Don't talk about cognitive dissonance when you are firmly nudged into your own bubble please. 
---
I always adher to group etiquette at that point, so if people roll N/G, I will too. I only am of the firm opinion that there is no logic in not rolling all need. There is true logic in rolling NEED on ALL blue/purple BoE's because they represent a nice equivalent on the AH. And always rolling NEED/GREED on BoPs since the gold value is NOT the equivalent to an upgrade on the AH.
---
However, one day group etiquette was established that people who could use that 200g item have priority. And this was vehemently spread throught out the WOW community. Whether it was the proper etiquette? I doubt it very much, but as you can see, anyone not subjecting to it is fanatically branded selfish greedy egoist. Which is completely dumb. Because, as I said before, a blue BoE plate armor represent a blue BoE &lt;insert any other armor&gt; anyone in the group could wield and not just the warrior that happened to be in the group by sheer luck.
---
It's very easy in the end: 
---
A) 100g plate armor BoE item drops. The winner sells it and buys a blue BoE cloth armor or leather or mail armor as upgrade. Or the warrior wins and he has an upgrade.
---
B) 100g plate armor BoE item drops. The warrior gets it because he happens to be the only platey. No-one else gets a shot.
---
This is all there is to it. A is fair. B is not. B is just the etiquette that happened to be there. 
---
tipsout needs a haircut
---
&gt; You're fundamentally misunderstanding this part. No tickets, zero tickets. No loot trading, zero loot trading.
---
&gt;Tough luck man, you gave that responsibility to the ML so deal with the issue amongst yourselves within the guild. You'll be needing to run some more Nef for that staff.
---
But thats what Blizzard would do (without this system) and what they did back in the day, so it changes literally nothing.
---
If they missclicked need, or gave ML item to wrong person both just made a ticke tand Blizzard solved it manually. Now players can solve it themselves and problem is solved faster and more efficiently.
---
Ah, that sounds a lot more reasonable.
---
Druids have the highest threat generation. So ideally you want them on bosses where dps can go all out with dps.
---
Oh, you fancy huh?
---
Better hurry the fuck up OP
---
I kill two dwarves in da mornin’ 
---
I kill two dwarves at night
---
I kill two dwarves before I kill two dwarves and den I kill two more
---
A remake of a joint smoking lyrics from a band called Sublime! It’s no wonder it got removed! But it was awesome while it was there!
---
Hoping to raid more and with a guild that actually big enough not to borrow from 3 other guilds to make it happen. Only stepped foot in MC and AQ maybe 2-3 times each. 
---
But its nothing compared to what they do to redridge
---
&gt;Disagree with trading loot. It messes with whole concept of loot being reward from bosses especially if you fill in spot with almost full guild group, they will have more chances to gear up specific player or just rip you off upgrade for a guild bank shard.
---
Unless they are ninja looting/cheating (which you can screen-shot and post on forums) you already agree to those odds when you join the group in the firstplace, assuming the semi-pug posts /tells you the loot rules before the run.
---
Sorry to break it to you. That's the tbc interface ingame.
---
my guess is July 2nd its when ffxiv expansion releases and also blizzard possibly hinted for a July release when they showcased the character customization one of the characters names was July.
---
Forums? no one will be reading those, and you can't post anything like that on a subreddit if one is made for your server, that's going to be witch hunting and you can't do that. 
---
Trade chat? People won't care or will laugh at you for spamming "who cares about BRD/SCHOLO/STRAT LOOT" (if its in the game as is) the friends that robbed you will right click report you and silence you.
---
the only thing you can do is not party with those people again they will face no other consequences.
---
the farm is across the river next to the camp, good effort but you failed at the actual layout reflected in the game.
---
Swap on the fly and when it swaps the box comes up asking everyone to agree to it.
---
what in the flying fuck is positive about re-releasing 15 year old content? i was part of 2 world firsts in naxx in vanilla, it was great then, but that game and world is dead and gone. NOTHING that's happening with classic is going to recreate those feelings for me, you or anyone else. it's not the same, gaming isn't the same, the people aren't the same, it won't be the same. it will feel exactly like retail does right now.
---
this news isn't even news, it doesn't matter how they release content that MOST of the people playing wont' be able to clear. MOST folks will have trouble clearing MC, not because it's difficult/complicated but because the build up to get to a gear level with the right resistances requires time that people today DO NOT WANT TO SPEND ON WOW. there will be a similar percentage of players clearing naxx at best, most are going to think there is a bug or something when 2 ticks of a debuff kills them, people today aren't mentally ready for that type of raid. 
---
classic wow is going to be a disaster. just leveling to 60 will be impossible for today's average LFR hero. that's just the world that blizz created for a decade and there is no going back
---
i loved vanilla wow, but even i have no urge to go spend weeks leveling to 60. 
---
you can NEVER GO BACK, that's true for everything in life. 
---
In WotLK, I was 10-boxing and got all my characters to the exalted rep in ICC by reseting the instance to farm trash week1.  I then made bank buying primordial saronite and crafting the leg pieces.  I also made sure to keep the prices reasonable, charging something like a 10% crafting fee for what the mats were otherwise worth.  Always saw a few people swoop in early trying to sell stuff for outrageous amounts before I listed another reasonably priced piece.  Managed to hit the gold cap doing that.  
---
Individual drops are less meaningful than they were in vanilla, much easier to replace or find a similar alternate option.
---
Imagine the incentive for a guild to all roll need on say, truestrike shoulders or felstriker if they're in a mixed group, so their own melee gets it. 
---
loot trading should not be allowed, imagine running a 5 man, but only its a 4 man guild group and they all rolls need on the item to trade it to themselves, leaving the 5th member a pug nothing
---
I don't get why that was removed in a game that depicts genocide. Weird moral compass blizzard has sometimes.
---
&gt;It meant I couldn't ever raid on my priest (nobody would ever ever invite a pvp geared spriest)
---
That has nothing to do with your spec. Spriests are used in raids. You mention gear, but that has nothing to do with your spec. Besides, you keep a second set of gear for PvE (although mostly it won't be that different between the two gamemodes). In regards to having maybe some PvP orientated talents - they can't inspect your build so how should they know? And who cares if you lie a bit in a PuG. Of course it would be easier to find a group as holy, but that's the point - you are more locked into your choice.
---
Or you could find a guild.
---
&gt; I would suffer heavily pvping on my rogue.
---
That was my whole point. No one says you have to be good at everything, then why even have specs to begin with? Remove them, all will be equal in all content. As I said, *you* may not like it, but all I did was explaining why some people prefer it and why it should not be changed.
---
&gt;The RP perspective was irrelevant because some people would spend 100g a week doing both, which would allow them to bypass the 'feature'.
---
Not at all irrelevant. The vast majority will not have 100g per week to waste on respec, therefor all my points stands. Sure *some* people will no-life the game, but that doesn't affect my points much, since it's a minority. There will still be a ton of people that does PvP in PvE specs and visa versa.
---
It seems like you are almost attacking me for what I said, I didn't bash your opinion - I simply explained the other side of the story. Do with that as you will, I'll be happy knowing dual spec won't be in Classic anyway.
---
As long as there is enough people to get stuff done, the more people there are from there the less important you are as an individual.  So that UBRS key you have?  Guess what there's 100s of other people online with it too.  You trying to sell that mage water?  Guess what....  A friend wants to run scholo and you're bwl geared?  Go pug it man plenty of people are running that shit.  
---
Too many people undermines the social structure of the game.
---
tank loses aggro boss turns and instantly cleaves the raid
---
Oh Night elf starting zone is one of my favorites! It's awesome, that's all you need to know.
---
Ah I agree that would suck
---
If they stick to server communities, like in old days instead of x-realms such people will get stigmatized and eventually nobody will group with them. Yes, it's a risk (hunter weapon!) But it's part of original experience nonetheless . You can't have "original" and "improved" at same time. 
---
I'm willing to take that risk and keep my stand against loot sharing in any form resembling current system. 
---
Btw. You can always reserve/ask for specific item if it drops while forming group.
---
How about loot rerolling instead of trading? One time, within a few minutes and only eligible for those who also rolled need/greed (can opt out the roll as well)
---
Winner has to initiate obviously, that way if you need to ninja, it's not guaranteed to go to the friend if that's the plan, and Blizzard can still not deal with tickets
---
Mikeoxbig
---
I never dug into it while actually playing retail.  Just reading your post got me curious how they were handling it.  I just kinda always assumed the data was realtime or close to it.   It, for whatever reason, never occurred to me it was just doing it in batches during client restarts/ui reloads.
---
Question: Does zoning (say into a dungeon) have the same affect as reloading the UI regarding reading local files in or out?  I've had a mixed bag on zoning vs reloadui fixing various issues, so I"m not sure.   If you're an active player moving around and changing zones/instances a lot AND it does force files to read in and out, then that would at least increase the update interval.
---
Let's say you and two friends are in a PUG. Your two friends agree to roll on the item (which they are eligible for) but pass it on to you (Player A). This is the scenario OP wants to avoid, since with Loot Sharing they'll just win the item and then trade it to their friend behind the raid's back. 
---
Let's take this exact same scenario and put it in vanilla. Three friends in a raid pug.
---
All three friends roll for the same item. Player C wins, but they wanted to give it to Player A. Person B opens a conversation with Person C and makes up some story about sorry but you weren't eligible for the item due to bla bla bla, could you open a ticket to have it transferred to Player A? Player C opens a GM ticket, explaining the situation. The GM does not check rolls, does not read up on the raid's loot system, and does not consult the Master Looter. The GM simply transfers the item from Player C to Player A, end of story.
---
So far, i have tanked everything up to bwl (waiting for AQ to open in the next weeks).
---
I can tank most boss without any problem (exceptions are chrommagus because you can't use the sand thing in bear form and nefarian because he turn you into a cat randomly, well in theory these 2 are still doable but its really a bad idea).
---
If you are going for druid, you are most likely going to be an offtank and you will maintank a few bosses where druid are superior (resistance fight like geddon and ragnaros (also on ragnaros you have a feral charge on much shorter cd than warrior intercept without needing to lose rage and stance dance and you can also turn into a cat to avoid fall damage) and bloodlord lashlayer because you have better effective health to mitigate his mortal strike)
---
Also druid threat is superior to warriors (unless they go fury and dualwield) so whenever threat is more important than survivability, you might be asked to maintank the boss too.
---
For example, in bwl, i end up maintanking everything but chrommagus and nefarian because of my superior threat.
---
Haha it was the best part for me
---
I think that raiding in 30/0/21 is fine.  Especially if you are in a PvP focused guild doing farm content for equipment.
---
Loot trading is often hidden. 
---
WoW sets always looked unrealistic though, even in Vanilla.
---
Super underrated farming spot is the first part of BRD. Its got a reliable spawn for dark iron, dogs that drop great items to vendor, good skinning from the dogs, and decent greens.
---
If you were to take mining as a mage(which basically nobody does), you're looking at 60g+ per hour in BRD. 
---
You tried, this one simply doesn’t get it.
---
I think this was the one we used back in the day: https://www.profantasy.com/
---
But there are a lot of hits if you Google “fantasy map maker.” There may be better (or cheaper) ones now.
---
Too overwhelming. 
---
buT SHarDiNg iS bAd fOr LaUNcH - a post last week 
---
guess what bro. increasing the player count isnt vanilla.
---
i started over a year into vanilla on a fucking rp server and leveled just fine.
---
You're not wrong, but they weren't super over the top back in the day.  Not as much of the moving parts and ultra colorful glowing shit.  It was much more natural and classic fantasy looking back in the day, for the most part at least.  
---
&gt; such people will get stigmatized
---
We don't know if that's going to happen at all. Abusing loottrading may as well be generally accepted by the playerbase. It's not 2006 anymore, and a social stigma only stays a stigma if the action isn't generally accepted by most people.
---
Well the guy started with "This sub really is mostly Min maxers huh?"
---
Despite the fact that he was referring to raiding, and he personally doesn't intend to raid so it doesn't affect him whether other people want to min max there or not. His whole comment was designed to get a rise out of me. Just throwing shade for no reason.
---
It was 8-12 iirc
---
This is definitely classic. It's AQ era, pre-Naxx.
---
because we already know vanilla will be good, we want tbc, we want wrath, cata is questionable but i know people would like to play mop again, i just hope we re-do every expansion.
---
He wasn't swearing *at* anyone, he was just swearing, the other poster however straight up threw insults at him.
---
How I don't think that's rude? Because selfish behavior that negatively impact others should be called out at every opportunity, including but not limited to intentionally making other players experience worse in a video game.
---
Happened all the time to me during MoP-Legion era while leveling new characters. It will be even more rampant in Classic WoW where loot matters more. People will always try to sleaze out others in order to get ahead. It's the nature of the playerbase. Dare I say its the nature of the community that so many people have rose-tinted glasses towards.
---
I can relate. Because of WoW Vanilla I routinely passed on promotions due to a conflict with my raid schedule.
---
Spent hours and ours in my basement totally avoiding my ex wife. Had a fridge and a large trash can and lots of fruity beverages.
---
Fell in love with my Guild Master and had an online affair that nearly became real life.
---
Then BC came out and all my epic loot was worthless and then 40 man died. And I rage quit.
---
I dedicated all that recovered time to family and advancing my career.
---
Fast forward a little more than a decade. 
---
I divorced that abusive spouse. Took our son to raise alone. Remarried moved across the country. Bought a Ranch. Have a great job in finance making more money that I can spend.
---
And in the back of my head I never got over that breakup. Not with my ex wife but with WoW
---
I told my new wife last night that I’m gonna need to take atleast a weeks vaca when the game came back. And maybe some time to play here and there. 
---
She’s supportive because she doesn’t know better. And her brother who died of cancer was a big WoW player and when he died there was a massive in game funeral and she’s like to remember a bit of him.
---
Pretty sure Blizzard is out to ruin my life like Meth does to so many 
---
All classes use their tier sets from every raid..
---
I tried but I was never accepted in a raid as a shadow priest as their dps was abysmal since they weren't allowed to use up 2 of the 8 boss debuff slots and would oom in a minute. 
---
And say byebye to loot in 5 mans when a premade of 4 needs on everything cause one of them needs an item 
---
I hope to see more from this guy about other classes too.
---
Warriors are popular and all, but you just hear too much about them, leaving you overfed with it. Good stuff nonetheless.
---
I think you are mostly describing launch issues, which be literally the same on classic servers depending on how severe and long lasting the sharding will be.
---
Yeah, if you are 3 weeks into a fresh server people will bitch-fight over elite mobs and what not, but lets say 3-4 months, and you can't find people to group with because a lot of these quests are long ass chains and what not.
---
The more people at your stage of the game (your progression lvl) makes content more accessible, as oppose to having to either skip it entiirely or put your progression on hold and wait for everyone to finish, or get boosted.
---
Some classes/speccs also doesn't function well outside in the open world (healers especally) who constantly have to group with people, if not enough people or any people are doing X content at any time, then they might not be able to do it either, and there is a lot of these cases in vanilla. Which in my opinion creates downtime, which is the worst part of vanilla and the thing J. Allen Brack explained when he said "you think you do, but you don't", and as far as Iam concerned he was completely right in that aspect.
---
Higher pop is better for the longevity of servers imo, especally if you are not going to play concistently with a guild throughout the entire lifespan of the servers, more people means more people are at different stages doing different things which means that more content is always open for everyone, as oppose to being stuck either ahead of the herd or behind, which is what Vanilla is infameous for.
---
The higher pop solves the worst aspects of vanilla, improves the best aspects, makes the game much more fluent and most importantly, every zone in the game feels alive.
---
Haha yes! I felt your name was familiar somehow dude. Are you going to team up with them on Classic? I loved Blacklisted, but raiding US times in EU time zone (1 - 4AM) took its toll on me eventually hence I had to leave👀
---
Definitely this. BRD is broken up beautifully. If you know your shit, you can get in and out in 10 minutes for Arena runs. Lava runs (Lyceum/Magmus/Emp) shouldn't take more than 20-30 minutes, either. Quest runs take quite a bit longer but that's because there are quests for every piece of the dungeon. You can break up the quests if you really want to. (I don't - would rather knock them out in one go, then come back later to farm for specific items).
---
I just realized that the valley of trials is basically an Orc Barracks from Warcraft III and that we're basically fresh units ready for battle in RTS terms. Very meta.
---
Does Sword Spec for Warriors out-dps Axe Spec in PvP?
---
Classic is like the old school adventure-RPG style game that begins when you create a character like the others have mentioned, retail/current wow is more similar with modern hack-n-slash instant-action slot-machine-for-loot game that begins at max level after you've grinded through the monotonous leveling progress.
---
There is a variant of it (quite more expensive, recipe requires ZG rep) called *Living* Action Potion. It does break the effects and provides inmunity to them, but at the cost of lasting only 5 secs or so. 
---
I might be biased but warlock is life! Such a fun class all round. Shamans are very fun in PvP as well though and gives you a bit more versatility in dungeons I suppose. Bit yeah warlock all the way.
---
If case will be that ninja looting will be common practice, solution is simple -guild groups only
---
I will fish instead of jumping around the AH, maybe.
---
Get what?
---
Blizzard doesn't have the stance on items that he wants them to have. He says if you loot item then blizzard won't interfere, but in reality they do, and they always have.
---
He is arguing that Blizzard shouldn't do it, and I am arguing is doing it anyways but this system saves both us (the players) and Blizzard time.
---
sharding is ok for launch, imo.   
---
But it shouldn't be used to pump server populations so high, that turning it off causes all questing to halt on the server.   
---
Just long enough to get the initial wave of players spread out across the zones.   
---
Like after 2 weeks, you'll have the first 60's and a bunch of people inbetween.
---
If they have the pre 1.4 mounts at launch for a limited time I'd probably change what class I choose to play based on that. My plan is to main a pally, but I'd probably roll something as a NE first just to get a frostsaber. I know you can do Darn rep grind on any race, but I'm not sure how much of a pain that is.
---
Except the GMs would just reply "We have no ability to transfer loot between players. Have a wonderful day in Azeroth!"
---
You should say if you're NA or EU
---
No, they will get the stigma and reputation attached to them, and people won't group.
---
And you just keep screenshots as proof if someone asks, and post them wherever your server/community is located and spread the news.
---
Then if it becomes a problem, then it will deserve punishment. Misusing the GM ticket feature would hand out punishments of varying severity. At first it would just deny your ability to contact a GM for x days. Next it would punish you with more severe punishments if you continue to misuse the feature, such as temporary bans. Problem solved.
---
2 minute timer instead of 2 hours.
---
I agree, but after making 20+ sets for every class, it's understandable that they run out of ideas, and just go for flashy stuff. This is actually the reason they dropped class-themed sets in BfA, instead focusing on raid/PvP/race-themed ones.
---
Here are a few examples of BfA sets that I think look awesome, and aren't really flashy:

He sounds jealous
---
I find tailoring pretty helpful for a Warlock. Especially if you can get rarer patterns like Felcloth Gloves &amp; Robe of the Void.
---
I remember talong more or less full control over high end enchanting materials on AH for a while and made a bunch of gold. I was starting to get bored of the game and had like 5k gold laying around to play with. One guild were not that happy with it...
---
Pretty much this. Nack when i started i knew nothing. Now i know EVERYTHING!
---
&gt; Humans have nothing that benefits paladins.
---
Every Man = get out of stun/fear.
---
Establish dominance
---
Loot trading wasn't in the base game. Pretty sure it came out in WOTLK.
---
guess what, starting 1.12.1 without Dire-Maul and Nax isn't "vanilla" either 
---
I used this monitor to play WoW back in 2004 in college. Still have it in the closet and now married,  three kids and homeowner. Man I cant wait! #Bronzebeard server
---
Awesome :D its missing the area on the side where you kill boars
---
I plan on enjoying the undead story line this time. 
---
(Last main was undead rogue, after faction change)
---
That said I look forward 1-24 as a human  mage/lock just to relive my past again.
---
in BWL you either have a paladin or two in the middle of the razorgore room or you have everyone in the raid kite in a circle
---
getting 40 people to kite is no small feat
---
Tailoring boi. Robe of the void is BiS for a longtime. Then you’ll eventually have your ZG cloth set with the tailoring set bonus and you’ll wear that for a long long time 
---
I agree that this argument is mostly flawed. Most iterations of it rely upon a group of friends all working together for loot which doesn’t really make any sense. First off, if people are rolling need on things that aren’t upgrades for their main class, then I’d leave the dungeon. Period. Secondly, if 3 other clothies are all rolling need for the same cloth gear and I’m a clothie then I still win need rolls 1/4 of the time. Sure, that one guy is getting all of the loot from their friends but his friends are getting conned into running something for no reason and if they want their friend to get a piece of loot that they could wear so badly, I don’t really have an objection to it. They are putting in three times the effort as me, shouldn’t they get three times the loot. 
---
Furthermore, people can’t “accidentally” ninja loot now. 
---
The only argument I could reasonably see is getting pestered by people trying to buy the loot off you if it drops. If you’re not interested in selling something say no and move on. If they continue to pester you tell them to stop or you’ll leave. If they don’t stop just mute them and leave. All of this being said if me (a clothie) was rolling need against 3 other clothies and someone won it and then sold it to a group member, I might be a little annoyed as that’s not in the spirit of BoP, but honestly, it’s a game and if someone would rather have the gold than an item they need, then I’m not sure how upset I could get. Especially since there wasn’t really much stopping someone from opening a GM ticket and doing this in the old system anyways. 
---
I’m willing to listen to the other side of the argument if I’m misinterpreting the problem but this has been my perception of the issue and frankly I don’t see the issue. 
---
Doubling down on both dps/healers/tanks wont really help the LF1M tank problem...
---
The issues you are raising have existed in vanilla and have always existed.
---
There will be people on the cutting edge of progression, those who are ahead of the curve, those who are in the average, those who are slightly behind, etcetera.
---
Try finding a raiding guild that does Karazhan a month into TBC launch. You'd lose track of them. Try finding a raiding guild that does Karazhan when Sunwell Plateau came out. Uh, well, there's maybe 2, and both of them mega casual.
---
Gathering.
---
Tailoring is only important at lvl 60.  (before lvl 60 you just give your cloths to a friend tailor and he will make your stuff, at lvl 60 you need it for bonus)   So just reroll tailoring once the ZG patch drops and until then, make money 
---
*No.*
---
Appropriate 
---
As a paladin who played vanilla, hunters in the wild can suck it.
---
&gt; Its only the downtime between when you are doing the content, I would assume you spend just as much if not more in doing the actualy conent. 
---
You could use the same argument for a lfg-tool or flying mounts, it speeds up downtime and let's you play the "content" faster. But that doesn't make it better in my opinion. Be careful what additions / changes you want, haha.
---
&gt; I think vanilla just feels much more cohesive and fluent on a higher pop server, its easier to get shit done all the time, and there is always people everywhere, always something happening. And with a lower pop down to 3k I feel it will stagnate a lot. 
---
I don't play on private servers so I can't really say much here other than back in the day Vanilla did not feel stagnant at all, the game exploded in popularity for a reason. Yes, we live in a different age. Yes, it's no longer a new game, but it feels like many on this subreddit gets "circle-jerked" into believing there won't be any noobs playing because everyone knows everything. While that's probably true for the 50k subscribed to this subreddit, we might just be 5% or less than the Classic population. These people won't burn out or feel done with dungeons after month 3, because they'll still be leveling, whereas on private servers I imagine the majority is VERY endgame focused, and not particularly casual. I wouldn't worry about the world feeling dead if I were you, even if the realm population stays at its original size.
---
I'm off to bed however, nice having a proper discussion with someone not sharing my view on the topic! I hope you'll have a splendid night.
---
No lag. So there’s that
---
Back in Vanilla I leveled an alt with a set group through dungeons.  We got together one night a week and ran 2-3 dungeons.  During the rest of the week you got all the dungeon quests ready and maybe got a couple levels if you were behind.  It was definitely a slow way to level, but it was fun doing every dungeon in the game (and I think the most interesting was doing RFC as alliance at appropriate level).  It is definitely something I plan on doing again in Classic, but for an alt since it is so slow.
---
yeah sorry i misunderstood. And i agree completely with you, as another guy wrote in here as long as the loot trading is only open to the masterlooter and whoever he traded an item to, it sounds much more reasonable
---
Lmao at all the downvotes, most major pservers put respec caps because who wants to play a hybrid when your respecs become 50g
---
why would there be any lore map? who would make those?   warcraft novel writers? 
---
"It's almost like people are just playing for the population hype and not for the game itself."
---
I don't care about the game "feeling alive". I want to play the game, not watch people running around.
---
I'll have my companions. I'm creating a guild for playing the game, I won't need to pug (which is not something I find interesting at all).
---
People have different tastes. Vanilla is not a one size fits all. Actually if Blizzard raised the population cap to pserver levels I wouldn't play. Just like I don't play on those overcrowded shitty pservers. It's horrible. Fortunately I believe just as they are dialing in the gameplay to be as close to Vanilla as possible they will also keep the Vanilla population caps. :)
---
No you havent lol. The last time you played vanilla was 2006.
---
In vanilla I did paladin / mage. Had the mage specced for pom pyro and had trinkets for it, they called it a '3 minute mage'. Was fun.
---
That’s a chad move for sure. Gotta respect the dedication 
---
I had the same reasoning back as a child, hence why I rolled a night elf.  
---
I will go human for classic tho, for 3 reasons:  
---
1) bis pve racials for rogue  
---
2) Better animations/model imo  (out of all the races)  
---
3) best level 1-30 experience, with deadmines close by and shorter travel times
---
I used to take screenshots but I was too young and computer illiterate to know where they were stored. Wish I had my old hard drive
---
it seems like one of the greener areas of ashenvale? i would say feralas, but it doesn't have that same lighting. op has possibly gone places we have never heard of
---
They arent fucking you over by rolling need. You are fucking 4 other people over by taking 1000 gold for yourself. All that shit you wrote about not being able to farm the gold applies tp everyone in the group. 
---
10-boxing?? Jesus h Christ 
---
Yea yea..maybe... I know those people probably exist, but I heard enough back in the day to form my own opinion and it aint what you wrote. 
---
Keep in mind that I am not talking about R10 or even R14, but full on insane hours for months on end. Let’s not kid ourselves; to make that choise you are no kid skipping class or some student on summer holiday.
---
A R14 is not enjoying life, but grinding out a project which has a very high opportunity cost in terms of rl. Noone can get to R14 while keeping that hypothetical spouse relation healthy, I promise you that much. 
---
Lock because you can eat rogues alive with SL.
---
Yes he is suggesting that they shouldn’t interfere, you are saying “but they do it anyways”...
---
He is suggesting that **they shouldn’t be doing it anyways, ever**.
---
The GMs only very very rarely ever fixed loot mistakes.  It usually was just a sorry not sorry situation.
---
&gt; if they reversed talents it would shake things up a bit.
---
I mean, sure, but balance used to *suck* for many classes. I need old warlock talents back as much as I need falling through the ground and mobs teleporting into / out of mines back. 
---
Warman 
---
Cheers! Have you maxed tailoring in vanilla or pservers? Just trying to get a gauge on approx how long it’ll take / whether it’s feasible to save cloth on a bank alt and rush through it once I hit 60
---
&gt; I'd make a video, but it sounds like even more work.
---
Also, Edgies isnt BiS for the entire game. There are various gloves you will use instead depending on your gear situation. Edgies are only really any good on lvl 63 bosses.
---
No but devilsaur didn't drop. The options are need/greed/pass on the item that dropped. 
---
nah I checked the palas bis for bwl patch and its mostly or all nonset
---
Yeah not a bad option! Cheers for the help!
---
I'm not sure if zoning into/out of a dungeon has the same effect as reload UI. It might.
---
Just go Warrior, prot.
---
This was so common in vanilla, people would LITERALLY wait untill you fight a mob to gank you, specially rogues :D 
---
Vanilla Classic should ALWAYS be available. That's the purpose of all this. There is a version of the game that MANY people considered great, that is no longer legally playable. It wouldn't make sense to progress the servers passed Naxx, without leaving originals behind. They SHOULD release new content or re-release the expansions, but they shouldn't replace the Vanilla Classic servers. Eventually, you SHOULD be able to play almost every iteration of the game (at least the end of each expansion).
---
Are you this dumb?
---
Threat is irrelevant on Patchwerk. The tank could just sit there auto attacking and will likely hold ago as hateful strike gives them a ton of threat every second.
---
I have never had a GM refuse to fix loot mistakes, but that was in TBC. Our guild at the time came to the realization that GM refusal is almost certainly due to the raid failing to meet some kind of qualification for fixing loot--for example the absence of chatlogs. If the entire "woops" affair happened in vent and none of it was in chatlogs the GM can peruse, the GM will never fix it.
---
That's what the bullshit whisper conversaiton is for.
---
I didn't think there was a good answer to my question, turns out I was wrong.
---
&gt;You could use the same argument for a lfg-tool or flying mounts, it speeds up downtime and let's you play the "content" faster. But that doesn't make it better in my opinion. Be careful what additions / changes you want, haha.
---
Yes, I agree. But thats more of an extreme version, and I would even say that goes for TBC as well once summoning stones are added. In vanilla even if it takes you 5 min to form a group, it will take you forever before everyone reaches the dungeon, and you will have lots of time to chit chat meanwhile.
---
Dungeons also takes a bit longer, since AoE is not really a thing before you have super geared tanks, so there is still a lot of social interaction. Especally if you are doing super-long instances like BRD.
---
&gt;but it feels like many on this subreddit gets "circle-jerked" into believing there won't be any noobs playing because everyone knows everything.
---
There will probably be some, but I think gaming has changed too much and most games these days are designed around instant graitification like retail, so I am not sure if it will be a massive hit for  non-ex wow players. I'm hopefully wrong tho.
---
 So? They both cost gold. They both are gold essentially. The rogue sells edgies and buys gear he needs. Whats the difference? Why does the warrior deserve this?
---
&gt;If disenchanting an item would actually yield higher returns, then there might actually be a case to give those items to the disenchanter and split the earnings after or something.
---
This was actually a thing in vanilla though. People just didn't bother with it in pugs. 
---
&gt;opens up such a massive gaping hole
---
Agree, tiny problem, fix is a much MUCH larger problem, dwarfing the original minor issue
---
No one. Who hurt you?
---
All my old ones lost their image and colors long ago.
---
Horde all day everyday, the yard of orgrimmar is the best dueling area in the game :D 
---
Ignore all the stupid advice to go up holy to get conc. What a joke.
---
Go HARD in to ret and max it out.
---
Then up holy.
---
You won’t be needed to tank five mans 1-60. There will be plenty of human warriors who think they’ll be omg amazing pve kings at 60.
---
Start collecting healing gear from 50-60.
---
Respec healer after you’ve farmed your mount money.
---
Heal.
---
Do we know something about addons, like will i be able to use directly my super polished addons setups from vanilla p-serv or are we gonna start over with nothing and people will have to code new addons from scratch ?
---
BLIZZARD- No loot trading and No sharding. I don't mind the autoreport if you need to cut costs (though I don't like it). No Loot Trading!! NO CHANGES (pleease!!)
---
Well there is several ways you can do this u can get Skinning/Mining, to help gold and ore's. Or you can Herb/Alch so you actually have a cooldown to get the arcanite bars. 
---
Just make sure you reroll one of them later. So you can get the Bloodvine from ZG, we dont get hit% from talents, so this set is must have on warlock.
---
&gt; It will just be a worse experience, unless you play from launch-&gt; nax.
---
it will probably still be a faster experience than original vanilla - most people didn't play from launch to the end, most came in during later patches - most people have a better clue how to play games like this now, back then it was the first of it's kind for most people
---
I came in 1.5, I took FOREVER to level because I had no clue how to play an rpg, and still was able to raid. people are going to level faster, raid earlier, and progress further than they did in original vanilla even with no pop changes
---
Only if you're this big of a twat.
---
No, this is all wrong my man. Most people are going to enjoy the leveling experience. You're a private server sperg raider mong that wants max efficiency to end game, that will not be the norm.
---
&gt;The problem of people being at different stages of progression was "solved" by Blizzard by having everyone auto quality for the current tier of progression. This is not a problem that requires a solution. A moderate influx of players in the realm and the creation of alts is all that's required to keep a sufficiently healthy population in every tier, so long as there's at least one or two guilds, you have all the tools you need to reach the top.
---
Yes, I agree. But I feel like when the servers have those higher population, there is also a bigger influx of newer players, more people alting, more people on the "slacking" stage etc and across every lvl, and there are just more people that adds more options for how people want to play.
---
As you said, Blizzard "solved" this issue with auto-progression and more and more comeback mechanics, but I feel like the higher pop is also a type of solution because there is always influx of people who are willing to do all type of content even if some players have already cleared the end game.
---
Oh I’m an asshole. Still makes you a complete retard for commenting in a vanilla thread with EMFH omegalul
---
You aren't getting to pick between vanilla and not vanilla.
---
You are picking between two different non-vanilla options, all the while claiming that Blizzard should not listen to their playerbase.
---
This, Blizzard. Announce this in your next blue post, and I will be so happy I will try to recruit everyone I see to start playing with me! Since the post yesterday, I am starting to see the Blizzard awakening that inspired me to start a game company.
---
TIL retail vanilla servers would be less than a "ghost town". Vanilla started with a 2,500 server cap then doubled to 5k by the time TBC came out.
---
/cast cone of cold
---
/tickle
---
Nah sorry I don’t have any experience with that. Not sure how long it’ll take. I’d say if you’re focusing on getting 60 ASAP, just craft once you hit 60 like you mentioned. I don’t think you need any of the tailoring gear while leveling. You could likely make some money selling bags on a fresh server but that’s the only benefit I can think of. 
---
I do know that the bloodvine set is extremely important for locks specifically because they lack +hit (mages have a talent that gives +hit while locks do not). It’s v important to be able to get the set bonus for these items which is only attainable with tailoring  (gives 2% crit) 
---
Mages next week!
---
Yep. Its a bit too much work for pugs tbh.
---
yeah thats not a thing in vanilla Humans get +mace/sword skill, Stealth Detection and 10% rep.
---
We need to eliminate right-click report first.
---
GM's would trade mislooted items from day one. They have been clear they don't want the number of GM's they had to have to cover all the tickets, so the new loot system is in to fix the problem while saving them on paying GM's.
---
Cannot wait to camp, tame, and feed my Humar.  I'm getting my runecloth bags ready.
---
Anyone saying master loot mistakes happen all the time is a chode and never played classic. 
---
You gotta pick a persons name and then click another confirm button. Only a retarded monkey can fuck it up.
---
All the pro loot trading noobs must be Chinese farmers who know they can extort regular players. Loot trading will kill PuGs if you don't think so you live in some fairy tale land.
---
We had an alliance dominated side with pretty cheap AH prices whereas the Horde’s AH was extremely expensive.
---
Early in the game, I started trading various items through the neutral AH with someone I spoke with through the forums/our guild ventrilo. We made insane profits by buying and selling from our AH to the horde. 
---
This lasted for a couple of months until the rest of the server caught on and the AH was over priced on both factions. 
---
You are never rage-starved when tanking a raid boss.
---
I think you are giving everyone to much credit. I think you will just end up on an ignore list for spamming trade chat when no one else cares like half the people in these threads don't seem to care that its going to happen.
---
I never had an item restored or moved my entire time in vanilla.  I had heard of it happening occasionally, but it was definitely not the norm.
---
All I remember is two large bonfires you had to light in a huge room. There were some torchbearer enemies you had to spot and kill in crowds of weak enemies, then you took the torches they dropped to light those bonfires and a door opened to a big lava giant boss that led to the Emperor's room.
---
They who is healing the rest of the party?
---
&gt; #nochanges: LFG is terrible because there's always some rando you can do any content with, at any hour of night.
---
&gt; #alsonochanges: But can we make the servers bigger, so that I can do any content I want, at any time of the day I want?
---
Just like the S.T.A.R.S. team having a "USB Dongle" in 1998.
---
What was wrong with a good old fashion M.O. Disk?
---
I saw a druid OT in ZG just fine. Couldn't tell the difference between him and the regular warrior OT.
---
&gt; I VERY vividly remember bear druids being virtually useless tanking raids in vanilla
---
I VERY vividly remember our guild using a bear tank for Ragnaros 
---
Found the warrior
---
&gt;As long as there is enough people to get stuff done, the more people there are from there the less important you are as an individual.
---
I agree, but thats not a bad thing. I don't want one single player on the server to have the UBRS key, or that rare enchant. That just means that I "can't" do the content I want to without a lot of downtime, in which I think there is a bit too much of in vanilla, especally on lower populated servers.
---
&gt;A friend wants to run scholo and you're bwl geared? Go pug it man plenty of people are running that shit.
---
God damn right, fuck Scholo, if it was strat I would do it. Thats not going to change anyways, you can aid people to an extent but generally you want something back for it, and not carry people 24/7. Having pugs for side content is a good thing, imo.
---
&gt;Too many people undermines the social structure of the game.
---
I don't feel that way in vanilla, likst sure maybe 300 have tier 2 instead of 20 people. But people will still clearly stand out enough to form their own identity, especally people who are more involved in the community or have a thunderfury or whatever.
---
Playing with the exact same people all the time can also be a bad thing imo, as it gets stagnant.
---
Blizzard wouldn't answer the tickets.  That's what we're hoping for.
---
My 17" natural flat CRT took me through several old school mmorpgs back in the day. It did it's job well!
---
And this is why I'm okay with sharding in starter zones at launch.
---
yeppers. dungeon can't be too difficult mob-wise or layout-wise or people will drop group then complain about it forever
---
&gt; and even on 10k+ servers are recognizable, and its easy to make friends unless you are intentionally anti-social.
---
A few people are recognizable, but most blend into the crowd. On a smaller server, almost everyone is recognizable.
---
I know, but they do and they used to do it as well
---
I feel like higher pop just comes at far too steep a price. I strongly preferred medium population realms, like 1k or a bit more at most. Max pop realms are simply insane--it feels like you lose any kind of individuality. It feels only a step removed from cross-realm sharding frankly. There's so many people that it doesn't even matter.
---
Meanwhile, back in vanilla, I was leveling my dwarf hunter, and there was this level 60 Druid called Axeron who boosted us through Deadmines. I was just a kid, and this guy was an adult with children. He wasn't just one of many. He was the only level 60 druid in Westfall, bothering to do that. I haven't met another well-meaning guy like him since then while leveling.
---
I don't like the idea of the place crawling with players because it doesn't just remove your own uniqueness, but of those you meet. Not only are ganks and cheats and people tagging your mobs more prevalent, but so are the nice people who jump in to help you when it's clear you pulled too many mobs.
---
When there's a thousand of the latter, who cares, move along. When there's just one, you strike up a chat with them, and become friends.
---
**why are you repeating yourself**
---
Hi, /u/BrandonLindley
---
Cata affected most/all of them - simplified, added easier maps, smaller elite groups etc. Prepare to die! :D
---
Keep my ADHD and reroll syndrome in check.
---
I remember playing with feral druids in BC, didnt raid much in vanilla kinda just ran around like a special kid wearing a helmet. However, if i can recall, feral tanks didnt really have to worry about def gear and stacked stam. I dont remember if they made stam/agility give defense or how it really worked. Did they change everything once BC launched?
---
Dude, that cable management.  Is it all part of reliving the past?
---
I'll be damned... Guess it's been too long
---
Or, just maybe, hear me out here. Maybe the GMs could just refuse to trade mislooted items? I know! Thinking outside the box here. Radical idea, right?
---
I can only speak for myself, but if I discover people ninja looting I just put them on ignore instantly (I usually ask for proof as well tho). And I think a lot of people do as well.
---
and if guilds gets a bad rep for having ninja looters, they will have trouble recruiting (as people are less likely to trust them) or they will maybe take actions against whoever gave them the bad rep.
---
I dunno, but it usually does have some consequences.
---
That was right around the time they were getting more widespread, I build a new machine at that same time (Christmas '05) to start playing WoW and I got my first LCD screen with it, a majestic 19" non-widescreen. A friend had already been using one of the really early ones for a couple years to save space in a tiny dorm. 
---
&gt;intentionally making other players experience worse in a video game.
---
Fear Ward is a crutch for lazy or incompetent tanks.  It only helps Ony, Nef, possibly another?  Which makes +5% Spirit superior for +90% of the other fights.  Tell me how Dwarf is the best Priest again?
---
From what I understand with the 2 hour limit you would essentially be able to sell the item to anyone. Am i wrong? At least a short window requires the final recipient to be in the instance.
---
Well, kinda shitty to a lot of carry dungeon runs. We would always reserve some items from certain bosses when running 4 man and just pug +1 for the 5 man run. Then we would change to ML on said bosses and simply /roll if we got what we didn't need. It's too good of a dynamic. The best catch up system ever implemented in the game.
---
nostalgia is fleeting. the choices you made back then were because they were what attracted you. You have probably changed as a person since then. You should pick what you are attracted to now. 
---
Tailoring isn't all that bad for money making. Mooncloth has a two day CD which can maybe net you 5g just like alchemy arcanite transmutes. Plus there's plenty of money to be made on a few niche items/prebis stuff.
---
which would be a huge change. Blizz has always fixed loot, and would still deal with a flood of tickets for it no matter how many times people are told they can't fix it. It has been that way for the entire life of the game, I don't see them wanting to change to a worse customer service stance.
---
No, I am not even a speed-lvler. I take my time lvling, do dungeons and professions to make it less monotonous, but at 60 is where people will start gearing and min-maxing. Which I am certain will be the case for classic servers as well.
---
That's all of them
---
Oh no, not that door, we were actually stuck on the door leading **to** the room with the torch bearers. We jumped down into the lava and got to the entrance of Molten Core, but the door was also locked from that direction as well. Then we disbanded.
---
Do you perhaps remember how to open the first door?
---
Really unfortunate how people think that people won'tl respect each other despite gloating about how back in the day it was all about the community.
---
I'm a 29yo EU-(rp-)PvP brit bro with enough vanilla experience looking for a guild of focused peeps who want to progress steadily and enjoy all vanilla has to offer with a real community emphasis.
---
Not interested in loosey goosey guilds who accommodate noobs in order to give them a place to fit in OR guilds who are so focused on progression that they're willing to go through undue stress to attain it.
---
Will play mage on either faction and am happy to raid 2 or 3 nights a week. If I sound like a good fit for your guild hit me up with a pm. 
---
But all these theorycrafting with 1.12.1 talents made feral viable. So maybe (I haven't seen the pre-1.12.1 talents) could have some interesting choices that would open stuff up.
---
I have no idea, but as of right now the meta is alread pretty much solved and optimized from launch until nax.
---
2.5K is plenty when everyone is in the same time zone. The best thing about 2.5K is that the community aspect of wow really shines. You get to know all the guilds, you recognize lots of players, and you have meaningful rivalries with the other faction. The larger the server gets the more you sacrifice these things.
---
The ultimate answer to the “tourist problem” is server mergers. If done right they can help keep server populations stable.  
---
You've got me curious. In Master Looter raids where chat existed that confirmed the mistake?
---
I have never heard of a GM fixing loot assignment for anything but raids. Raids, with Master Looter, where at some point you talked in chat (raid chat, party, whispers, anything) about the mistake?
---
If they want to stop the flood of misuse GM tickets, they would just implement and warn about punishment for misusing the system. If a guild is pestering GMs about loot, pretty sure they would not like a temporary ban and would stop sending in those tickets that they themselves know will serve no purpose. 
---
Win win in the eyes of Blizzard: Don't have to waste time on loot, and better less abusable loot system for classic.
---
I know LFR and pug raiding is a thing now in retail, but do people really expect it to happen in Classic?  I mean, maybe some of MC, but I don't see it going beyond that, and certainly not enough to be an issue.
---
I played all through vanilla (left the game a couple of months into WotLK), and I don't remember any pug raiding going on.
---
Then join a fucking guild?
---
I find it funny that we obsess about how the community when it comes to classic, but don't apply that same logic to loot trading. If you are a part of a group that uses loot trading in an abusive manner I promise that the realm community will catch on and those that abuse the system will be marked and most people will know that they shouldn't play with them. 
---
I am not someone who thinks loot trading is bad or good, I see the arguments for both and understand. But what I don't understand is people claiming the community and server identity is vital to classic and then just assuming abusive behavior of loot trading will go unpunished by the social aspect of said realm community. 
---
And how often do you grind mobs +3 levels higher than you ? Where this skill really shines. The 10% rep i understand its handy to have. 
---
Dwarfs get Stone-form could save your life. In both pvp and pve.
---
But at the end of the day, you pick what you think looks best and you are most comfortable with.
---
the 5-8 other healers in the raid..
---
“Prepare to die” probably the most accurate thing I’ve read on this 😂
---
Can any of them eat mage food? Like the ones with bread icons?
---
Windfury also kind of blows imo. 
---
Forget loot trading, all loot final.  We should be advocating for "return loot to corpse" option.
---
It's a no compromise solution, it negates all the negative aspects of loot trading, but gives the party a "whoops" button if somebody legit miss clicks.  The person who receives the loot has to initiate.
---
Even with need before greed system, if win an item and force a reroll, either on purpose or by accident, you can't influence who will win the next reroll.
---
So a worse customer service system plus bad will from banning people for a thing that blizz has always fixed. Perfect, or they could use the system already in the game that has none of the issues people around here think it will. Seems like an easy choice, loot trading is in and problem solved.
---
Americans are weird! It’s all good until it involves drugs or sex!
---
I couldn't tell you all of them, but WC and ST were both cut way down.
---
Well, if thats what you want I 100% disagree.
---
Having ML accidentally click on a name and give the azure spell-blade to some pleb would piss me off, and it would cause a lot more fuzz than this system for sure.
---
So half your raid comprises healers? O_o Ookkaayy...
---
Which ones haven't?  
---
Why would you?  
---
Yes.  I did hear occasionally of items like Ashkandi or something, but usually not other items.  Most of the time if it was not a bis item people just said oh well.
---
Oh you know it but this pic was when i was young in my 20s
---
Tailoring to 300 &gt; Make Robe of the Void &gt; drop tailoring and live your life.  
---
&gt;A few people are recognizable, but most blend into the crowd. On a smaller server, almost everyone is recognizable.
---
I mean, ofcourse. If you play with 10 people you will always recognize them. But with the slow ass progression and gearing in vanilla you will always stand out regardless.
---
I severly doubt that at any stage of vanilla that having people in tier 2 will be the norm.
---
Yah I preserved this one.
---
It wasn’t enough for my server back in the day.  My buddy and I had to make horde alts just to get them to queue for AV.  There would be days before any AV match happened.  It was really sad.
---
Shaman
---
Everyone loves shaman. Especially Tauren Shaman.
---
You bring lightning, beef, and fire to the party. It's like a barbecue!
---
Yep the true 0 ms monitors good old CRTs
---
yes
---
Loot trading effects everyone.  ML mistakes only effect one person and should make you reconsider who you put in charge of your loot.
---
2.5K is perfect when everyone is in the same time zone. The community is strong; you actually recognize players and guilds and enemies on the other faction. The larger the server pop becomes the more you sacrifice community aspects, and the more you become just some random dude that no one knows. 
---
HELL YEAH
---
Yep, there's limits to what people will pay, the game is full of alternative gear that's only a tiny bit off BiS. 800G for Edgemasters, I'll jump on that. 1400G though...guess I'm going 2hander with Flameguard till the seller comes to their sense.
---
As the current system works you have 2 hours to trade the item to anyone who was able to loot it (anyone in the group) regardless if they are in the instance or not.
---
My idea is to reduce the cap to 5 minutes (so if its after the final boss the two people ninjaing can't just AFK in the instance for up to 2 hours before the trade)  so if you are suspicious that they are up to something you can just stay there and wait. And be able to see the trade in the chatbox and call them out for it if they fucked you over.
---
To relive the past once more.
---
It is common, there are threads on both forums asking for TBC servers alongside or after classic wow. There are/were TBC private servers. I have seen ratings of the expansions from before anybody had any idea classic wow was a reality (therefore no voting bias) and TBC and WOTLK were both the 2 most popular. It just seems people like you who feel threatened by people getting TBC and not filling up your classic server is a motivating factor for you becoming a lawyer on a videogame reddit and demanding citations. Yeah people wanting a videogame is a "wild claim". SHEESH x YIKERS = your post
---
Loot trading is the problem we are trying to avoid.
---
Warlock, definitely, especially given your time constraints!  
---
Still have my vanilla lock.  She ended up being a blood elf when I changed faction, but yeah.  Locks are too much fun.
---
Forget loot trading and all loot final systems.  We should be advocating for "return loot to corpse" option.  It solves the same problem Blizzard wants to solve with loot trading, but none of the drawbacks (trying to influence roll chances).  It's a no compromise solution, it negates all the negative aspects of loot trading, but gives the players a "whoops" button, which is what Blizzard wants.
---
The person who receives the loot would have to initiate.  Even if you group uses need before greed and you have the option of returning the item, if you win an item and force a reroll, either on purpose or by accident, you can't influence who will win the next reroll.
---
At best, if you win an item you didn't intend to win, the player who wins the item can force a reroll and everybody who really intends to keep the item has equal chances, and at worst, the player who wins the item can ninja the item, but you're in the same spot as you would be with all-loot-final or loot trading for that matter, so no real issue there either.
---
Lupus isn't that rare, theres over 200,000 cases in the US every year 
---
Yeah, it's a problem you have invented and there is no need to worry about. 
---
I remember being younger and thinking OMG how does that guy have that!! I thought it was so exotic.
---
He said DM not VC
---
Barber shop adds another money sink. Price it accordingly and it should absolutely be added. No one actually identifies people by their characters skin color or hair color, that's just retarded.
---
I see you have a lot of faith in the community to not abuse a very abusable system. That's great for you. I look at it more cynically, and from my experience with the types of communities formed on private servers, they tend to do ANYTHING, no matter how despicable to get ahead.
---
Wait are you not aware that raids are 40 man in vanilla? 9-13 healers is pretty standard. 
---
Yeah, if you have 200 wipes on fucking Onyxia, but your last wipe was at 1%, and your guild wants to finish even if its 8 hours past raid time, everyone is tired as shit. You down the bitch, and the fucking ML makes a huge mistake and raid-rolls the bag (as oppose to hunter/wl prio), does it super fast cuz he wants to go to sleep as he start works in 3 hours, and then everyone gets pissed (at least the hunters/warlocks). Then you just have an unfortunate situation that was not intended, that was just a stupid missclick mistake.
---
So (realistically) you would force the whoever got the bag to make a ticket and threaten him to get blizzard to give it back to you.
---
Or you can end up in more situations with even more drama, like if the thundefury binding dropped and it was given to a shaman etc.
---
The system would just have been awful
---
In vanilla, Blizzard made a bad oversight with mage talents. The talent "Magic Attunement" increases the effect of Dampen Magic and Amplify Magic by 25%. Seems like a lame talent, until you realize that if you use this talent and dampen magic, wind elementals in Silithus only hit you for 1 damage (the required minimum otherwise it would be 0 or negative)  
---
I would pull the elementals in pack of 20-30 and AOE them all down. I couldn't get all of the spawns at once because even at 1 damage per hit, it would still add up.  
---
I could pull the entire lot in 2 pulls. I pushed the price of Essence of Air from 20g per down to 5g in 8 hours. I let up on it for a day or two so the price would go back up, and did it again until it dropped to 5g each again.  
---
After awhile I got a bit worried about being banned for it, so I stopped.  
---
5000 player cap will trigger sharding. #JustSayNo

Because you were repeating his statement so then its just naturally that I repeat my response to it.

---
Which guilds lol? DW fury is more threat and is used way more in speedruns. Bears are still good, but eh.
---
I played horde back then. Rolling alliance this time for a bit of a new game feel. It's a hard choice to make
---
oh
---
&gt; So the argument is that the unsurpassable skill ceiling of Vanilla WoW is a dude who can't maintain his basic rotation and film at the same time during world first kill of the game's final boss?
---
More that pirate server players seem to have an emotional need to caricature everyone who played real vanilla as implausibly incompetent, based on cherry-picked data.
---
&gt; So the skill ceiling in Vanilla is knee-deep, but at the same time there are some complicated reasons for completely deviating from your rotation as a fury warrior that nobody can figure out by looking at a video?
---
Asking stupid questions is an argument now?
---
Your reasoning seems to be "I can identify ways individuals in old videos made some mistakes. Therefore this explains absolutely all discrepancies between pirate server performance and real vanilla performance". But like the other dude, I think you are trying to explain a mountain with explanations that suit a molehill. Some dude forgetting slice and dice or a warrior wasting some rage doesn't explain a 300% difference in raid outcomes.
---
You say you don’t see it as an issue, then proceed to list the exact issue.
---
Which is solved by not adding loot trading.
---
So then you're saving 80g (wasn't that the price?) to not have a mount from 40 to 60
---
Alliance is all I can speak of, this is from memory: Ironforge is the place to be. Gnomes and Dwarves get you there the quickest, I think it's a tossup. All my bank alts were gnomes with offensive names like Farmerchow. 
---
The spider venom quest for horde was infamous for the low drop rate. IDK if horde had more quests out of Tarren Mill than Alliance did out of Southshore, but it sure would have *felt* like more quests. 
---
For a majority of private server veterans, that is true. On the other hand, it is likely not true for the majority of the players in general.
---
&gt; Why do you think loot trading will be a thing, when it wasn't in classic anyway.
---
Because blizzard said it would be at blizzcon. I don't think it's an issue, but it's not some made up rumor. 
---
Are you sure this measurement is significant to any plan for speed leveling or whatever else you have in mind? The delta here can’t be more than a minute or two ...
---
I don’t think the “issue” is an issue at all. This is manufactured drama. 
---
And we already know why Blizz is leaning on loot trading. There will be more people upset over inactive GMs and wasted loot if they take the advice of the vocal minority stemming from this sub. 
---
Came here to say this. Didn't get my 1st until 06 or 07 I think, and I was an adult with a job.
---
Likely to stand in fire/10
---
That's epic
---
All the new models look way better its just vanilla fan boys acting like the old one doesn't look like some 1$ action figure your mom gets you while shopping at a grocery store.
---
Don't give your bindings to a Shaman and there wouldn't be a need for Blizzard to hire more employees or introduce an abusive system.
---
No thanks, arenas, flying mounts, gear resets, 41 point talents restricting talent choices and killing hybrid builds, raid or die gameplay, deleting the entire world except for ~6-7 zones and making all old content irrelevant.
---
Fuck TBC and everything it did to the MMO genre.
---
I rolled warlock back in vanilla. I had herbalism and alchemy for my professions. I needed the money for my lvl60 mount and potions for raids. Yea tailoring has some very good items for a warlock but eventually you will get better overtime. These items are not needed to get into a raid. I might changfe when classic comes out. Roll my alc and herb again make my money then change one of my professions and go trailoring BUT ONLY AFTER i have my money to level tailoring and get buy the much neede supplies from losing one of my current professions. Side Note i made ALOT of money with pots HUGE AMOUNTS and imnot saying which potion made me the most and tbh looking at it most people would not notice :).
---
ITT: #nochangers complain that you can't have loot trading because it wasn't in vanilla
---
also ITT: #nochangers contradict their "muh community" argument about famous ninjas
---
&gt; not having any option for loot in the ticket interface saves them more money
---
you think that will stop people from opening the GM tickets anyway? They'll just pick a different option and blizzard will still have to pay someone just to say "no". It's seriously the worst of both options.
---
Pushing crits off the table doesn't matter at all if your raid is threat capped and doing no damage. It also serves no purpose if the healers can keep you alive thru crits anyway. If you arent dying, might as well have more threat. Being 440 defense in prebis requires wearing terrible items just cause they have defense on them. I dont even know if its possible to go 440 in prebis after defense nerf. Maybe if you wear "of defense" greens. Youll have like 3.5k HP, but hey at least you can't get crit right?
---
Defense isnt the be all end all stat for tanking and it never has been. 
---
Yeah, not worried about that since this place is an echo chamber. If I wanted upvotes I would say something retarded like "They need to put out TBC but without flying and not raise the level cap" or "This is current year, we have to have 15k population cap servers or it will just feel dead". Instead I'm working with reality where loot trading is a system that never had the issues you are ascribing to it and are so sure it will have. 
---
There are assholes, and some few times assholes will do asshole things, they then go on ignore and I never see them again. Over time the whole server won't play with them. But there is no reason to spend dev time removing a system that will save them money, save them time, and make loot problems easy to fix.
---
It is an issue, it’s an absolute huge issue.
---
If you go the route of loot trading, you will normalize ninja looting from the start, and no one will give a shit when someone shows evidence of someone ninjaing/needing for friends or whatever.
---
If you don’t add it, ninjalooters will face consequences for their behavior.
---
I’d rather them not adding loot trading, people fuck up with loot distribution? Tough luck, learn from your mistake.
---
BC gave a talent that reduced bear chance to be crit by 3% if i remember right. You still had to get some defense/resillience from gear but you could get crit capped quite easily meanwhile you can't in vanilla.
---
I think you may have hit the nail on the head, I can't believe no one else came to this conclusion years ago 😨 
---
Noob alert.
---
I think the upper level is still there... but nobody has ever tried because nobody wants to do it
---
I hear you, and I see your passion. We just disagree. Normally I’d just leave something like this alone entirely, but I don’t want Blizz to have the impression that this is a game-breaking issue for the community. I’m fine with whatever decision they make on this as both have logical reasoning.
---
You have very clear anger management issues my dude. Take care.
---
Je artikel kwam net voorbij bij mijn aanbevolen artikelen op google. Heel tof gedaan!
---
Yeah i saw. He said it was too cool of a picture not to use. 
---
Gimme a break. What an insult to our intelligence. 
---
The fundamental problem with tailoring is supply and demand, there's just too many tailors. Smithing and Leatherworking have specializations to split the population in 3, so there's fewer crafters that can make what you want. 
---
Then tailoring is also the only prof that offers pre-raid BiS BoP gear, which means nearly every caster wants to go tailoring at some point.
---
I’m not too familiar with warlock vs shaman but I wanted to throw in 1 thing: I really wouldn’t value the warlock mount too highly. You will probably hit lvl 40 with about 40-50 gold, and you can easily farm mobs for vendor trash and make 15g/hr (conservative estimate). I grinded mobs 38-40 on a Druid and had gold for my mount (and then some).
---
I don't think that speed to get to the city is the question.  It's the distance between the AH, mailbox, and the Bank that's the issue.
---
* The **worst** for each faction would have to be Undercity and Darnassus.  Undercity has the bank, AH, and mailbox on 3 different levels, using different flights of steps and all.  You have to run all the way up and down to use the AH and mailbox together.  Darnassus has a similar issue, where you have to run past the AH and come back around to go in.  And both have water if you want to take shortcuts, which slows you down more.  However, I think Darnassus will be a lot less populated than IF or SW, so it might make sense if you want a less laggy hometown.  Undercity has no such advantage (if any does for Horde, it's Thunder Bluff)
---
* The **best** for each faction is Ironforge or Orgrimmar.  Ironforge is a straight shot from the AH to the bank/mailbox, so it's easier to auto-run.  It might be a little bit further than Stormwind (I'll have to check), but overall it seems to be the best option.  Orgrimmar has the advantage over Thunder Bluff because even though TB is closer, the NPCs are not protected by a barrier, which means the auctioneers in TB can be stacked on by a kodo mount.
---
* As implied above, the **middle ground** is Stormwind or Thunder Bluff.
---
So it would seem that the 2-race cities (**Ironforge** and **Orgrimmar**) are the best, which means you have 2 races to choose from for a bank: Troll/Orc or Gnome/Dwarf.
---
With that said, I made an Undead bank alt and ran it to Orgrimmar.
---
&gt; Fear Ward is a crutch for lazy or incompetent tanks
---
lmao, ok, tell me again how tanks are going to avoid a fear happening more than every 30 seconds, or how your rogues are going to avoid it
---
&gt; Which makes +5% Spirit superior for +90% of the other fights.
---
You're right, it does, by a very tiny margin, as I also suggested somewhere else in the thread, there is a reasonable argument to be made for playing human, however no such argument exists for playing nelf.
---
&gt; Tell me how Dwarf is the best Priest again?
---
Tell me again how anything you just said makes an argument *for* playing a nelf?
---
No chance Blizzard are using anything but the modern macro API.
---
The quest text does say northwest
---
Your messages really show the ”give me no changes, with this x change that I want”
---
ya dont expect to aoe grind in the open world on a fresh server, unless you play on a dead server in which case there are tons of other problems.  Mages claim to fame for gold per hour and xp at 54+ is aoe farming in dire maul east and also north i believe it is.  With those not in the game for release until the 2nd update expect to be frost bolting things down with the rare chance to do some aoe when no one is around.  Id happily farm/quest next to an opposing faction member, but a mage monopolizing and entire area to aoe? yea thats going pvp.
---
I mained PvP warlock in vanilla with rogue alt, and I can say for sure that you will 100% not be disappointed as a lock, its a very fun class with lots of utility, it starts strong in PvP and as you get more geared you will eventually become a competitor for the #1 pvp class in the game both in 1v1 and large group content. While I think Lock is interesting to start and kinda fun, it gets REALLY fun once you get geared (anything T2+ I'd say) and have something silly like 20k + effective HP and you can seriously just face tank 2-3 geared players.
---
50 dkp minus is my rating for it
---
We don't know definitively, but classic largely uses the modern client. For macros and addons, it seems like 1.12-era stuff is retired
---
This. Even if you don’t care about min-maxing, dwarf priest is so much better and you will regret it at some point. 
---
Nope. 
---
Crickets. =/
---
I can see another addendum in here. Mark possible loot to be master looted (hard) or mark a boss encounter to change loot type all in the UI which still has to be agreed on before accepting an invite. If you're already in the group, but not in the instance then you will be prompted with how loot is distributed and what will happen to specified loot. On the flip side if you are all in the group and instanced besides 1 person, that 1 person will be prompted.
---
Just giving some ideas. I know these changes will be hated by my #nochanges brethren, but there will be problems that can be fixed without a GM — hopefully the community can vote on these changes in case they are broken. 
---
It’s because of the mace from Gnomer, that thing makes so much threat with 50% attack speed for 15(?) seconds and you can use it three times without cd and then switch to another. Be prepared to farm it.
---
This solves none of the problems people have with loot trading, and narrows the scope of legitimate cases where loot trading might be used.
---
It does nothing to prevent a group of 4 from all rolling "need" to give it to the one guy who actually needs it.  But it does make it a problem in this situation: warlock wins a robe over a mage.  An hour later, a robe drops that is clearly a Warlock robe (i.e. it has shadow damage on it).  The Warlock can't give the first robe to the mage, because you limited it to 5 minutes.
---
The #nochanges crowd isn't out there because of rose-tinted glasses or or some arbitrary reasons the game felt better.  It's because changes have consequences, and the consequence of loot trading was the abuse that it opened up.  (Abuse that was technically possible, but much more limited before loot trading).
---
How is that an insult to this sub's *intelligence*. Jesus the dwellers of this sub
---
For the shaman, yeah -- your only melee "ability" being RNG is just awful.. For warriors Its basically godmode.
---
Never played on a CRT, because LCDs were a thing in 2004....
---
Umm... what?
---
You realize I'm not the only person interested in playing classic WoW right? Of course I wouldn't do that, but there will be people who will do that. A *lot* of people play to maximize their own gain. A shared loot system benefits those types of players. The entire premise of your argument was that "this won't affect the game at all" my comment was just to prove how wrong that is.
---
BRD isn't a raid. If you're going for an ultra rare item like Ironfoe you are absolutely going to be required to group with random people in a PUG, and a shared loot system invites these sort of situations to occur.
---
You just need a alt to mail to. You shouldnt be playing ah or playing on your bank much at all if you have the time to level and that is your goal
---
That being said, the token can affect classic. Since retail &amp; classic share a sub, it's very likely we'll see offers (both legitimate &amp; scam) of "trade some Classic gold for Retail gold"... aka token with extra steps. Will blizzard intervene? Who knows, they allow cross-server setups of buying dungeon/raid runs, so there's a precedent for this kind of trading
---
3 people (or even worse, 4) against you in Trade chat.
---
**"This guild ninja'd this loot from me."**
---
*He's just mad because his DPS sucked.*
---
*He kept dotting the sheep and got kicked, now he's trying to flame us.*
---
*He lost the roll and now he's mad.*
---
Even worse if the guild can right-click report you and get you squelched.
---
Whether or not people are in T2 is normal is not relevant.
---
When you look at 30 people, and 6 of them are in T2, you remember those people.
---
When you look at 300 people, and 60 of them are in T2, you don't.
---
Saying "Oh, 6 of them are my friends, so people are just as recognizable in either situation" is missing the whole point of Vanilla. I have hundreds of people on my friends list in retail, that doesn't mean that people in retail are recognizable.
---
Assuming the group doesn't bash you back in trade chat, and 3 voices outnumber one.
---
Assuming right-click report isn't in the game, and the entire guild doesn't right-click report you to shut you up.
---
Thanks homie, glad you liked it. Getting another vid done hopefully by Thursday. 
---
Then the pug has to try an make friends, fuck what kinda tragedy that will be.
---
Me and a few friends who all had multiple alchemist alts would often buy all the cheaper elementals from the China farming bots and then transmute them all into whichever elemental was the hot one at the time at a much higher mark up. Bought me and my friends our epic mounts that way 
---
Yeah for sure, as warrior kit isn't dependent on it at all it's just a great extra 
---
90. Yes. I personally would do this if I played shaman or druid but obviously not if another class. And if PvP comes out before most people hit 60 it's 100% worth it because the rank 7/8 items for shamans and druids makes ghost wolf and travel form 55% speed. 
---
Nah i'm not part of the \#nochanges crowd

So if 4 guildies and 1 non-guildy are in a run, then this happens:
---
1. Guildy 1 needs item, but guildy 2 wins roll.
---
2. Guildy 2 puts item back.
---
3. Everyone re-rolls, Guildy 3 gets item.  Puts it back.
---
4. Everyone re-rolls, Guildy 4 gets item, puts it back.
---
5. Everyone re-rolls, Guildy 2 gets item again, puts it back.
---
It doesn't improve the chance of the non-guildy to get it.  It makes the whole process take longer.  The original system is simply better.
---
Others mention it but Spirit is beneficial and reputation is a grind as is so 10% extra there helps progress you through the game in many ways. +hit for all weapons you will be using as a Paladin is no small thing either. If the trade off is stoneform vs everything else then I would consider it a sacrifice to take Dwarf over Human. 
---
Not to mention squishing the gear onto a smaller model when you can see it in its full glory on humans is an aesthetic difference I would say also favors Humans :)
---
Oh, you mean KG?
---
If she's never pulled the ball out of her mouse and pulled hair out of it, she's too young for you bro
---
the current private server strats shouldnt fully work on classic. sitting on bosses and being auto crit for procs is a bug, theyll still get the giant rage swings but no enrage procs
---
You are all forgetting the most useful macro:

When targeting the chicken in West fall. Congrats on your free chicken pet. 
---
I may be biased because I really like the ability to heal and do a lot of burst damage in PvP... And happen to have 3 buddies rolling as warriors in classic.
---
But I promise shaman is a strong fun pick without social connections. Pve hero's can't get enough good shaman healers to get all the totens they need for raid buffs, and they level at a moderate pace. Ghost would and 15 minute heath stones makes leveling pretty smooth overall.
---
I ran some PuG MCs and ony runs towards the end of vanilla. We weren't doing it as a guild at that point. Had to get my leveling buddies some purps. my guild name was respected enough people joined would run them on weekends.
---
Not in OG vanilla sir, rolling in the AH was all too common. 
---
That is incredible, get a green as a lvl 20, put it for 3 gold, stupid guild buys it and resells, you just got 4 times the gold you would have selling to a lvl 20.
---
I dont know about you, but loot trading shouldnt exist, i Blizzard should ignore tickets about sending incorrect loot. Its the player's fault, in the end.
---
Yah but for 0ms it wasnt a thing and the resolution didnt even compare.
---
Are you not aware that there were 20 man raids in "Vanilla" Wow?
---
It would never get to 5 because the person who put it back wouldn't get to reroll.  Putting it back is a pass on future rolls, they're just out.  At worst they would make you reroll 4 times.
---
All you're really saying is don't group with people who want to act like asses.  I don't see how the loot system is at all relevant.
---
Reminder that some pet species are glaringly better than others.. just look at the poor spiders, no abilities besides bite :(
---
you have the parry mechanic backwards. the way to take more dmg is to have the boss parry you.
---
&gt;After a successful parry, the defender's "swing timer" is reduced by 40% of your weapon speed (or even reset), unless this would result in a reduction to less than 20% of your swing time remaining.

Classic WoW is not a private server emulation, it's a vanilla WoW emulation. Private server WoW is NOT real vanilla, and while classic may not be vanilla either, it should be as close to it as possible (which is something that private servers simply have not been able to emulate to the extent which classic aims to).
---
Classic doesn't have to have any connection to historical progression and server rotations. Classic is it's own meta.
---
Fresh servers will launch just like they will launch this summer. Old servers that start to die will merge similar patched servers. 
---
Let's be clear, Blizzard is using private servers as the business template. This is the reality of the situation.

You can jump the wall to ratchet and take the FP to Org instantly. 
---
I'm such a weirdo that I leveled my bank alt in Classic to have sprint.  
---
Any DPS class.
---
How long did this take to make?
---
Do the rare pets do more damage or just look cooler? 
---
As they sacked most the GM team they won't process GM tickets about the loot.
---
2) Contrary to the "group play" vein... Shared xp is significantly reduced, most quest items aren't shared, and you'd have to formally party up to share mob tags, rather than sharing them naturally. While you usually needed groups for any group/elite quests (unlike retail), it's often slower to level with others... and if you do, you usually have to grind out the difference in mobs, having run short of quests
---
Egan's Blaster is BIS til phase 5
---
Yeah Ele is sick in PvP and resto is pretty fun all things considered (as lets be honest a fair amount of vanilla pve isn't very engaging for a lot of specs). 
---
When the majority agree on something, it's called an echo chamber? So if the majority thought that loot trading was not a big deal, I could go and call that an echo chamber? No, it's not an echo chamber. It's people who are rightfully concerned about a major issue, attempting to get their voices heard by the people who matter; blizzard. 
---
I'm not going to be changing your opinion, so let's leave it at that. The majority do not trust the classic community to not abuse an easily abusable system. You are on the side that thinks they won't. I can't change that misguided trust, and you can't change our distrust either. 
---
If anything that would change your mind, I would suggest playing a private server for a week or two. You will find rampant instances of ninjaing and abuse of systems. Those same people will be doing it when classic comes out.
---
I'll hard pass on that fam.
---
In terms of powerlevel, where does ZG gear stack up to MC and BWL?
---
I understand ZG is supposed to be a catch up raid, but is it a catch up to get \*into\* BWL, or a catch up for people that have been farming BWL.
---
every single time i want to come here i go to /r/wowclassic , i never learn my lesson. 
---
not sure what you're asking exactly, but when you learn your 40 mount at the warlock trainer it automatically grants you the appropriate riding skill.
---
What everyone ignores when it comes to this issue is that people will quit the game over this stuff when it happens in the heat of the moment. You can sit in a calm environment and insist on whatever rules you like, but people just aren't that loyal to rules when emotions get involved. If a rule fucks you over then the problem is the rule in many people's mind, including many people who are right now advocating for no loot trading.
---
Blizzard cares about keeping as many players as possible playing. This is why loot trading started happening through GM tickets back in vanilla. You can argue for a solution to the problem that runs counter to their goal but run the risk of hurting the game's longevity through player attrition. At the end of the day you won't find 100% of players acting rationally when hours upon hours of playtime hinges on someone else clicking the right part of their screen.
---
holy shit finally someone from bronzebeard server! ally or horde?
---
&gt;tell me again how tanks are going to avoid a fear happening more than every 30 seconds
---
You only need one or two Dwarfs to cover the 2ish second gap in tank cooldowns.  So hopefully we can agree that you don't need a bunch of Dwarves, nor does 5% Spirit blow Nelf out of the water.  Making the argument that you're just looking to be carried because you wanna look at some nelf ass because you don't have 5% Spirit is stupid.
---
If you're a min max guild and you already have a couple Dwarves, you'd be stupid not to take any Priest at that point.
---
It is 
---
Same. I had probably hundreds of screenshots of notable moments in Vanilla. Too bad theyre gone forever :(
---
It Livesss! 
---
Stick to one character this time around. I was a serial flip flopping reroller. Sticking to one main this time. I just need to figure out what class that is lol
---
That's not at all how it works, Patchwerk will still hit the main tank with his regular swings, and pulling aggro is very much possible. There's a vanilla vid of an early ignite stack overaggroing.
---
I agree with you, I'm just saying they dont want that scenario. 
---
Just go to [archive.org](https://archive.org) and go to petopia, that's what everyone used back in the day.
---
!RemindMe 4 months
---
(That ain't the song title)
---
Pick gold making professions then before ZG is released drop the lesser one for Tailoring.
---
Horde was with thornes of the black rose but had buddies in the EO guild
---
They haven't announced any rebalancing/extra content, if that's what you mean
---
This is on a private server where the population isn't 3k... 
---
Then he should make friends.
---
True. In our case we’ve committed to have our alliance guide in time for launch. 
---
Patchwerk's hateful strike is as follows:
---
Hateful Strike - Base damage is 22100-29900 physical damage, thankfully this is mitigated through high AC. The average hit is ~8000 damage on a fully buffed BWL/AQ40 geared Warrior in defensive stance. 
---
You are saying it does not matter if that crits?  I just want to be clear, you are saying it does not matter that you  could have a 16,000 damage attack.  Note that is before the enrage at the end.  It is simply unsurvivable.  The raid is dead.  Buffs are gone.  Soul stone and res because the tank had 430 defense because /u/dwfinitelynotcasper doesn't do middle school level math.
---
Thanks and what about the epic warlock mount ? Is it like the way before ?
---
Might want enchanting for Mara princess runs down the road.
---
What players? BFA is dead as fuck.
---
I want to do that while working on tailoring/enchanting too tho... there definitely is value there regardless
---
It's a good time to get into undead as well. Before they were all XxGrimDarkxX. 
---
I guess what I'm trying to get at is I would not put a lot of weight into something that could alter \~3 hrs of gameplay. 
---
The massive zone lag when trying to complete the new quest lines would say otherwise. But I don't really give a fuck about your salty ass opinions. Troll elsewhere dude.
---
You are wrong, influencers only get that influence by having a following. I.e. watched content, views on stream and followers on Twitter. If people do not engage in those ways they cease to be an influencer. So the advise of just not watching is the correct advise and the only one worth following, by actively critizing you create a buzz which only drives more people to watch the content thereby strengthening the influencer. 
---
&gt; You only need one or two Dwarfs to cover the 2ish second gap in tank cooldowns
---
And then who covers the rogues?
---
&gt; Making the argument that you're just looking to be carried because you wanna look at some nelf ass because you don't have 5% Spirit is stupid.
---
Making the argument that it's acceptable to intentionally perform worse for your own benefit is incredibly selfish and pretty much is asking to get carried.
---
&gt; If you're a min max guild and you already have a couple Dwarves, you'd be stupid not to take any Priest at that point.
---
If you're playing a priest you'd be stupid AND an asshole to pick nelf.
---
Back then the main horde guilds were straw hat pirates (the farm league) sons of tacondrious, nevers end, and thorns of the black rose
---
I'd like this opportunity to bitch about crafting economy in WoW.  I always charged for crafting, rather than asking for a tip, and sometimes I'd end up with a shitty reputation on the server for it.  I don't think I overcharged.  I had the recipes others didn't so they still came to me, but WoW just has this weird obsession with not making money.
---
I was so relieved when I joined EVE and there's no question of paying for manufacturing.
---
To my knowledge, both are simply damage multipliers &amp; scale with SP. If this is not the case, I'd like to hear
---
Please dont
---
With servers starting fresh, who's going to have gold to buy off the auction house? Not being sarcastic, just makes me curious why a bank alt is even needed, at least a month or two after launch.
---
&gt; They've spent one and a half decade perfecting it, there's no way they revert to an older version.
---
That's precisely what they said about retail.
---
I agree, but the same people will come downvote and make the exact same arguments they have been making for months now. Even though you have heard them hundreds of times and they were never convincing in the first place.
---
true thanks man!
---
It was awesome.
---
Shadow Meld is highly underrated and great, especially for new people. Drink+ meld saves the day. Starshards is butter on your bread when leveling, dint let them tell u otherwise! Great after a fear
---
Not bosses, trash mobs. I was speaking about aoe aggro.
---
ST in vanilla is a pain in the ass but it didn't deserve this
---
yeah guys be more specific. he’s obviously talking about 20 man naxx not 40. god. /s
---
but really, if you don’t know what you’re talking about don’t start up shit. just apologize for being wrong and move on.
---
Leaning lock after this comment!
---
While I recognize you’re playing Devil’s advocate here, let’s take this to the logical conclusion. Is anyone lower than 60 carrying around a trash-gear set for their spec? I’d venture to say unlikely.  So now that we’ve isolated the problem to level 60 players, who *maybe* do this (So remember these people are lugging around a main spec gear-set, perhaps an off-spec or PvP gear set and now a trash gear set for a very specific scenario, which leads me to already believe it’s unlikely). What’s their incentive to run a dungeon with a trash-gear set? To help their friend? Okay sure. But if that’s the case shouldn’t they get a shot at the loot for their friend since they aren’t getting anything else out of their time. To be honest, I’d rather them just say what they want to do and wear their good gear so we have a lower chance of wiping since it only at most reduce my chance of winning loot rolls from 1/2 to 1/3, but I could understand the other side if someone is really upset about the 1/6 decrease. I don’t know sure what the “right” answer is for this rare scenario, but I certainly don’t think that it is anywhere close enough to common to be “ruining Classic” like this sub will lead people to believe.
---
Also this problem can be avoided by two ways: 1) Get a variety of specs and classes in your group. I don’t think I’d run a 5-man with 4 clothies and a tank. You’re pretty much bound for loot disappointment if you are a clothie. 2) If someone can’t get to 60 and make enough reputable friends and guild members along the way to get the better part of a group together and avoid this problem then maybe they deserve to get schemed against, because they are clearly projecting their selfish tendencies onto others. 
---
Timbermaw trinket? Apparently everyone else is discussing a quest item that transformed you into this furbog.
---
Both are awesome either way. And I will DEFINITELY do that grind for feathers again. :D
---
Humar and Lupos are my favorite pets from vanilla, definitely.
---
Would you be willing to sell this or make prints that I could buy? They look amazing! 
---
suck they are dick
---
No, when the majority here agree on something it is an echo chamber since very few people in the overall community are here. The system never had the abuse you imagine, that's the point. It came in during wrath and was not a big deal, and loot was functionally the same in wrath as in vanilla. 
---
It was literally at last Blizzcon. You should watch the Classic panel, some of it is already a tiny bit dated info, such as the number of content phases, but there’s a lot of good info in there. That was the day a lot of the “no sharding, no loot trading, more content phases pls” posts started coming out as a reaction.
---
For the past couple retail expansions, blizzard has allowed you to pre-download the game to ensure you can play as soon as the servers go up. It's likely that blizzard will have something similar for classic. 
---
1.) Will “Green Whelp Armor” trigger off a hunter’s pet being hit? Apparently certain items worked that way like “Deadman’s Hand” when it was a thing.
---
2.) What are the best ways to get critted in pvp as a reckoning paladin?
---
3.) Will the handful of undiscovered ghost quests still be discoverable in classic WoW?
---
Not having 5% spirit is "intentionally performing worse." Bringing the whole raid down.  Lol
---
Have fun in your imaginary guild.
---
I was always too lazy to stance dance.  This time I'm going to be MC Fuckin' Hammer himself.
---
Again as a developer myself that would be suicide, 15 years ago there was no technology for sharding which is why it was INVENTED in the first place it takes a lot of a load of users PC's and Servers. Blizzard didn't implement sharding because they hated their users... they did because it helps the game run smoothly for the players and servers.
---
I am not saying KEEP sharding, I am saying if there is no sharding on release week, nobody will be able to level up due to loot, anyone with NOT a gaming PC (Which is a lot of players since MANY MANY people will TRY vanilla because HYPE) will suffer tremendously lag and problems.
---
Hey, blizzard is a huge AAA company, maybe they will create a server capable to handle it without sharding, its just unrealistic.
---
Can you send them and any future ones you do to me as well please :) lucky for my I have access to really nice printers and a canvas printer where I can make some copies! 
---
I always met people doing dungeons.  I'm a good tank so I could always get people to group up with me again, if I liked them.  I quit the game due to cross-server LFG ruining it.
---
All part of the Classic experience.  A decade of internet poison!
---
Yeah, man, because Naxx is the only raid content in the game /s
---
If you don't know what raids the game has just move on with your life. :V
---
That's because you had no choice in how you progressed through ST.
---
You had the lower temple area, which was completely useless, and dropped no loot, unless you had that one quest.
---
You then had the upper temple area, where you had to clear 90% of the corridor trash, and 100% of the dragon trash, in order to finish the dungeon.
---
Not to mention that, unlike BRD, very few classes had their pre-BIS pieces.
---
Can you send them to me as well? :) 
---
Got it. I completely agree.  I think I volunteered to be the Winter's Chill debuff mage back in vanilla just so I could have deep frost capabilities (Ice Barrier, Ice Block, Cold Snap) over being the optimal frostbolt cannon with AP and PoM.  Still probably wasn't as good as a 30/0/21 shaman/warlock, but at least was serviceable/not 2-shotted by everything without respeccing.
---
So letting someone know that not everyone likes their stuff is being a dick now?
---
If that's the case every one is too fragile. 
---
We better go and remove the downvote buttons lest people find out that their posts and comments aren't loved by all. 
---
I’ve been playing since 2006 but never on a CRT.  I do still have my original 15” 4:3 LCD I played on though, and now my son plays on it.

Do you mean the EU server? No.
---
What kind of grocery store sells action figures?
---
Low IQ post. 
---
That's rolling ignite. Which will likely not be in the game at all (mostly because it can do impossible levels of DMG). Hateful strike gives a ton of threat to the top two on the agro list. That's what established the coined term "Patchwerk fight". It means you go balls out with no chance of pulling agro.
---
I was going to say a fraction as a joke.  In fact, I was going to say "5/7" as a joke.  But the goddamn mods already flaired it THAT EXACT NUMBER.
---
You're gonna have a great time no matter what you choose!  One thing, I'd see some locks with cool looking names for their demons and get bummed out, lol.  Wow, my poor voidwalker.  If only I could remember it exactly, but I stopped playing right at the end of Pandaria.  It was pretty lame, poor dude.
---
TBH if you were on your bank alt for long enough that could be an investment worth it 
---
this one a little over an hour, some my others are quicker, Inkarnate is really forgiving to work with so in a matter of hours you can get some great detail
---
I think it comes from a combination of seeing it happen when it was implemented in live WoW, and knowing how much more valuable and hard to obtain dungeon blues are in Classic. 
---
I absolutely saw abuse of the system, and that was when most people could easily badge farm gear. But when Deadmines takes up to 2 hours from start to finish, that’s a lot of time investment, which leads some people to game the system if it’s in their advantage. 
---
And they won’t get caught because people aren’t going to follow you out of the dungeon and inspect you two hours later. If it was a 2 minute timer then that would make sense. And it will happen *enough* to the point where the ninjas get less ire in trade chat than the people calling them out. 
---
But edgemasters dropped, an epic mount didn't. 
---
If your bags are full and you want to save stuff to sell on the AH later in the servers lifespan instead of vendoring it, you don't want to go back to the main city just to put them in your mailbox when you could just mail them to your bank alt. 
---
Now why would I want to put a paperweight on my desk to relive my youth? 
---
Not 3 posts ago you literally made the argument that it was a good bonus, but now suddenly it's irrelevant?
---
But let me ask you, if intentionally making a choice that objectively makes your contribution worse isn't intentionally performing worse, what is?
---
It’s pretty easy to control an economy on a server. As long as you know the main players in that section, it just takes time and gold
---
I’ll be pleasantly surprised if I get to 60 within a year. Gonna be great. I plan to do every dungeon at least once on the way up. Ok, maybe not Gnomeregan.
---
I'm not 100% sure but as I remember warlock's mount is a skill (like a shadow bolt for example). This is why you don't need a riding skill.
---
Engineering is not optional.
---
Because people don't notice people who trade loot. You can just "pretend" to use the item and when the dungeon is over trade it to your friend.
---
Some of those drops could sell for like 5-10g. All that gold adds up.

Its okay everyone loved my comment so here's another one. 
---
That makes sense but my memory of vanilla (which may be skewed) was running back to town all the time anyway to buy spell upgrades.
---
Hahaha come on! WoW going to be in 4k?

When I first started wow I was always making this lame joke that the spells, talent trees, and classes were like world of diablocraft but looking back it kind of was.

Work work work
---
Are you confusing good or nice to have with necessary for being effective in a raid?
---
Are you suggesting that 5% spirit on a couple priests has a tangible effect on raid performance?
---
You throw around worse like you can measure it, like you wipe on a boss and pin it on that dang priest didn't have 5% spirit.  I'd imagine you'd run a raid with one less healer than take those dang worthless nevles.
---
All those naked night elf women dancing on the mailbox probably lost their virginity to this guy.
---
Dat loincloth, man.
---
Are you playin on pservers right now or just waiting for classic?
---
yep! every two levels you could purchase new abilltiies (the even levels). That being said, since leveling was a lot slower in vanilla you would being to have full bags with things you don't want to figure after 1 level or so, its just convenient to have 
---
&gt; I hope they do both servers; Huge which is the most playable and fun version, and expendable hipster servers with 2-4k cap 
---
I would *love* an option like this. With a 3k cap, I'll have no clue at launch that my server could be dead by late AQ40 - and I'm not relying on Blizzard to aggressively merge servers. They never have and precedent is all I have to go on. 
---
I'll take Nost's population over Garithos, my mid pop vanilla server, any day. Recognizing every player is overrated, it never gave me an overwhelming sense of community. It just made the world feel incredibly small. 
---
You must be a giant. 
---
Gotta have that underwater breathing accessible. 
---
Don't forget they just confirmed Dire Maul will not be in at launch. You won't be able to get the epic mount right away if you ding 60 quickly. 
---
Being the only person in STV... *the horror*
---
oh yeah. sheep moon first.
---
How restrictive is sharding?  I was picturing an instance with about 10 people in it.  Is it just you?
---
To be honest I think loot trading should remain.
---
If there was no way to trade freshly looted BoP items between party members, it would result in a huge spike of GM tickets. Blizzard likely doesn't want to deal with the customer support demand, especially when they've downsized the heck out of their customer service department in recent weeks. It would cripple them.
---
Assholes will still find ways to screw each other over, and a "no loot trading and no GM tickets allowed" policy would just fuck people over equally as hard.
---
Lastly and most importantly, [as this comment explains](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/acjfqk/the_problem_with_loot_trading_isnt_that_its_an/ed8gpf0/):
---
&gt; The ability to trade loot, within party, eliminates this defense. Okay, if you miss-clicked, then trade me the item back.
---
&gt; Yes, with loot trading people will be able to need items they don't personally need, this is true. without loot trading, people did that all the time. At high levels, in guilds, or groups for the more serious dungeons, people got blacklisted for it and the player base worked things out. That exact same dynamic can occur with trading for party loot, nothing at all changes. Assholes can be assholes, but you can still avoid grouping with them.
---
&gt; The only thing that does change is that you can identify the assholes with 100% certainty, since they can't use the miss-click excuse anymore.
---
And to this counter-argument.
---
&gt; Let’s say you have a group of melee DPS that are friends and join up for UBRS, all but one already have Truestrike shoulders but decide to equip another pair so they can need on the truestrike for their friend. They now have multiple chances of securing the loot for their group without anybody knowing.
---
As the Cynical Brit, Totalbiscuit once said... **STOP. PUGGING.**
---
Sweet. Do I get a trophy? Or do we only get them for participation now?
---
It's because you can skip so much of BRD. You have to do every encounter in ST if you want to kill the last boss.
---
Ahh right, you needed a key from the ghost quest outside in Blackrock Mountain's center I bet. There are so many keys to get in Vanilla.
---
It's really not bad on a normal population server. It didnt have the name STvietnam when vanilla was around. It was the most pvp you had experienced as you leveled up but it wasn't 10k private server bad.
---
Engineering is basically a given for any sort of serious pvp. Tailoring is probably the only other one that will help in any way, there's a couple of items you can craft that you will get some use out of, but really engineer/anything is fine.
---
It really seems so.  All these "don't give them a hard time for playing the way they enjoy" posts are alarming.  There's a serious underlying issue not being addressed.  It's not one or two mountain dew fueled all night ragers that should be laughed off imo.
---
Back in the early days, there were only auctioneers in IF and Orgrimmar.  That really limits your options here.  To one.
---
Wow I don't remember that **at all**. Holy shit, outside the dungeons? Fuuuuuck me.
---
I worry that, if sharding is necessary in the starting zones, it will also be necessary in zones like The Barrens. 
---
If they only split the pop in Elwynn, for example, 2 ways, so there’s 2 separate shards, that wouldn’t be very intrusive and would still House a high pop. But if it’s split like 10 ways, there would probably be some sharding in Westfall. 
---
It really depends on how many quit before 10. I suspect 50%, which would still mean a super high pop in 1-10 zones. And when you have 1-20 sharded, that’s the entire launch experience sharded, which is so against Vanilla principles.
---
I quit retail in 2015 and played vanilla servers for three years, sharding in 1-10 zones please. Unsharded starting areas are not fun or interesting, they look like the linked screenshot, standing around doing nothing waiting for spawns. Romanticize them if you want but it's a miserable waste of time and Blizzard made the right call
---
The quests there are great though. If you go there at around level 30 it's a free level from doing them all.
---
I'm not upset, going by your language it seems like you are. 
---
Why are you so offended by the thought of someone voicing their own opinion and not wanting to be lumped the group?
---
Are we not allowed to have opinions now? I thought this was the internet.
---
Good point! Being able to skip certain parts is no doubt part of why my feelings are so much more amiable for BRD.
---
Yeah, conjured food is all bread I believe.
---
If this incredible podcast didn't exist I wouldn't have lived through my daily commute. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME CONTINUTER LIFE AND SUSTENANCE
---
Good point! No doubt that's a significant part of the reason why in my subconscious I feel more amiable towards BRD than ST.
---
&gt; Mage is a pressure class/twitchy class. 
---
Really?  I always found my button presses exceedingly smooth as a mage.  Warrior I had to spam buttons waiting for GCD, but as a mage I knew exactly when I could cast again.
---
The idea that there will be ever new fresh servers after the original Classic launch is pure speculation anyway, so I'm not sure why you're so concerned about it. At any rate I'd imagine launching new clients/servers in any progression they want down the line would be effortless for them given their 14 years of MMORPG experience they now have.
---
&gt; Are you confusing good or nice to have with necessary for being effective in a raid?
---
&gt; Are you suggesting that 5% spirit on a couple priests has a tangible effect on raid performance?
---
&gt; You throw around worse like you can measure it, like you wipe on a boss and pin it on that dang priest didn't have 5% spirit.
---
You literally can though, in terms of humans it's literally as easy as opening your character sheet, in terms of a dwarf it's as easy as counting the amount of times someone got feared.
---
You're throwing away small percentages of performance calling them irrelevant as if it isn't the compounding effect of thousands of small percentages that makes an entire raid possible in the first place, keep throwing them away, and again FOR NO REASON WHAT SO EVER, and your raid is bound to fail.
---
They look cooler and before they patched them out some had unique things like quicker movement speed on Takk the Leaper or raw shadow damage instead of physical damage for the ever-popular Lupos. They're basically the same now but some rares have better attack speeds like Spiteflayer or Broken Tooth.
---
You don’t need to buy the riding skill for either mount, however, getting the Dreadsteed -adding up gold and time put in- is just as expensive. 
---
As was mentioned by someone else also, the actual quest for the Dreadsteed won’t be in the game until Phase 2. 
---
&gt;imagine rolling need on mail because you're gold jelly  
---
&gt;you fucking cuck  
---
July 16. It might not *be* July 16, but maybe they had that date as an idea, and put it in as an Easter egg rather than a release date they have to stick to, or else they’d get some backlash or bad publicity. 
---
Still I’d put money on July 16, but it could be one or two weeks off, realistically. July 2 to July 30 is likely.
---
Just make sure it's a wind serpent without a mana pool so its damage isn't nerfed due to the game considering it a caster!
---
I can almost see my ghost running 5 minutes to my body.
---
Esfand really needs to distance himself from Tips, he is losing alot of viewership
---
It took you 9 hours to come up with that?
---
For me, BRD had clear variation in the rooms. You were very aware that this bit of the dungeon wasn't like that other bit of the dungeon.
---
ST, by contrast, was basically four overlapping circles. Super same-y all the way through.
---
Fuck no :D
---
It’s Gorgeous 
---
They aren't gold. The edgemasters is there and the warrior can use it right now. The rogue may take weeks selling for a price they think is reasonable. 
---
Well, not *per* server. 
---
Thats it! That’s what so many people on Ally side complained about, Jailbreak! 
---
Hahaha go big or go homebut that would be to see it in 4k.
---
Not OP, but I’d pass along that, as much as I hope it’s ready in July, I hope they delay the game time and time again if it’s not finished.
---
there is still some space in the middle of the screen so i recommend placing there trinket menu with pally power and item rack.
---
also you NEED to double up on buttons so get bartender(or whatever was the bar addon back then) and place more bars on your screen and downrank some exorcism, some holy wrath and some turn undead. you never know when you need them, better safe than sorry.
---
20/10 would fuck that. 
---
i almost forgot. you can still squeeze in some dps meter, i can see that there is some room on the middle left side, but that's just me, i'm a perfectionist, what can you do, huh?
---
I want to say the key quest had you kill a guy nobody cared about otherwise, so having the quest NPC be a ghost you can only see while dead was just the start of the out-of-the-way stuff.
---
&gt;you're the only person in desolace
---
This is me 99% of the times i've done desolace as alliance. 
---
I remember being so bad at making money I. The beginning, one of my buddies (who dragged me into the whole thing in the first place) had to give me the gold to buy my first mount when he saw I didn’t have it at level 48!
---
Yes they mentioned it was gonna use modern api but limiting some functionalities like group finders and such
---
I dont see why thats "smart money". Based on what we heard at Blizzcon; "Cross-realm grouping? Never" Its safe to say that at the very least the spirit of what theyre trying to do is keep each server isolated for the individual communities, even if it wasnt explicitly stating BGs in this case.
---
And if youre going to go on about how single server BGs didnt matter for community, it did, as much as it did for dungeons. We lost half the community feel when xrealm BGs hit.
---
I found myself especially broke when I played a paladin.  I probably could have skipped training a few skills, though.
---
Petopia was the best!
---
I liked Arathi :O
---
It does seem like a natural pick sure, but all the effort to mine mats just isn't worth it compared to buying it at 60, unless if you plan on skilling engineering while leveling and plan on using mining at 60, then mining just isn't worth doing.
---
What if the warrior only has a Mace or Polearm?  Most common weapon for someone to have at that level is a polearm. 
---
30 sec, 3 charges
---
All classes contribute stuff to the raid, we're talking about damage. If you have more than 3 warlocks(well technically 2), then whatever utility warlock brings is useless because you already have debuffs covered. I'm not saying you should bring 10 mages and 0 warlocks, I'm saying you should bring 7 mages and 3 warlocks. 
---
No, we have things called "better in ever way" tvs now-a-days. 
---
Hi, /u/314159265358979326
---
Its for the classic feel is all!
---
You just wrote a full paragraph of things I don't think and haven't said and you still can't find anything to support the claim. Lol!
---
What cast?
---
That wasn't my experience in retail also, but I do remember barrens being jam packed with people. Which is why I said I am ok with sharding level 1-10. 
---
40 people was a bit crazy but that's what made it awesome. This picture also makes it look far worse because it's zoomed almost all the way in.
---
Sources? It's easy to say "oh this proc rate item is good, must be because private servers got it wrong", but really it's an item with a proc that lasts 10 seconds and STACKS 3 times. It stands to reason that there's a decent chance of it actually proccing more than twice in 10 seconds no? If there's a decent chance of getting 3 stacks while continuely autoattacking and using abilities, then that version of BRE is basically private server version and is BROKENLY strong. 
---

---
BRE is amazing for 2hand fury on horde. There's some pretty nutty pserver videos of people using it. if the proc rate is anything like that, it's a massive difference. But yes it's primarily a pvp item.
---
Yes. 
---
I don't have time to read all that but if you want to not allow nelves in your guild have fun.
---
Not me but I've got the G15 with the flip up lid which displays your character stats!
---
stop calling it a drood
---
You left out the possibility that they treat WoW like seasons and the classic servers eventually transition to BC and so on, with some creative server shenanigans for people who just HAVE to play Vanilla forever.  
---
eye fatigue says no thanks 
---
Hmm, so this talk of phases does bring up the question of whether we have the old pre-1.4 epic mounts available, and for how long? Likewise, since the servers will be based on 1.12, will quest rep spillover exist?
---
^(plz dont tell anyone but ret was absolute dogshit in vanilla because it didnt work like it is now on private servers).
---
**ret was awesome - all hail jamaz and zalgradis**
---
Enginering is must ofc.
---
Tailoring good on launch for the chest, and again once bloodvine (zg) is in the game. 
---
You can abandon tailoring after getting your chest, and I recommend you do so. A good replacement is blacksmithing if you are hardcore pvp, but more likely you will want some sort of money profesion. This can be skinning for aoe farm + devilsaur, herbalism for herbing(or DME aoe + herb if possible in classic), mining perhaps for BRD farming is that's a thing in classic. 
---
I do not recommend enchanting because you want to relearn tailoring at ZG and keep engineering which means you lose your enchanting recipes. Overall enchanting is not really as good as people make it out to be, the only real good enchants are MC/AQ ones and you need to be the guild enchanter to get them. It's a lot of effort for making decent money while in org/IF, but as a mage you can just farm in the world.
---
IMO, simply making all loot--even master loot--final is a perfectly fine solution for a game like Classic.
---
I just came off listening to the interview you did with Kevin (ep. 73) and I thought this was an old post. 
---
I never knew much about the developers (you know, the less known ones) before and considering how deep my love for this (version of this) game runs, it was such a treat! 
---
It’s also really validating to hear that he really understood, even back then, what would make the world feel special and that there’s more to the appeal than nostalgia. 
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
definitely! but i'm mostly referring to...
---
&gt;So yeah, warlocks is this shitty class that once fully naxx geared is... about the same dps as a mage.
---
before capping out on utility warlock -is- the better damage causing class. can't say i understand how that equates to a shitty class for you.
---
Will you level up as ele? If so gl being oom all the time and basically killing mobs with melee and lightning orbs. I tried to lvl up as ele till lvl 30 then I respecced to ehna.
---
This has to be Shimmering flats in 1k needles,  
---
I can see on closer inspection that you've really captured the absolute feeling of the zone  
---
You're just missing the 4 players that rode up from tanaris to gank players 15 levels lower than them and a heap of corpses around questgivers.
---
Yeah it has a great cluster of quests there, and it's even better when you're a skinner with all those basilisks, turtles, and scorpids you have to kill anyway.
---
wow, ppl are actually upvoting this. nice
---
One WHOLE level?!? Where do I sign up! (Oh, Shimmering Flats, cool :P) 
---
Why are you telling me to have fun when you're making it pretty clear you don't care about other peoples fun?
---
That sounds like all the vanilla zones in current wow. Even with sharding, coming across another player is almost a shock.
---
And to get their carrot on a stick trinket 😂
---
I went and begged for 5 gold coins in Ironforge and a fucking hero stepped up and actually gave it to me! I was just a kid and it was better than Christmas. I instantly made a beeline for the trainer.
---
Honestly, it sounds like projection.  These are the type of people who imagine it happening because they’d do it themselves.
---
In 5 years of playing I never felt cheated out of dungeon loot.  Raid loots were a whole different story, but the dungeon system worked fine in every iteration.
---
Wasting GM time for loot tickets is like arguing for more parking cops, wouldn’t you rather have them working on things that matter?  (After all, you can always run the dungeon again, and again, and again)
---
Flying killed any sense of community tbc had 
---
It killed wpvp where people landed on you, killed u and then took off
---
It killed travelling because people went straight up, aimed, auto move forward and left to take a piss
---
Think about how crap vanilla would be with flying mounts man.
---
I think you're making a bigger deal out of it than is necessary.  
---
Round robin gear upgrades. If the sword that dropped is an upgrade for both, but a bigger upgrade for you, then give it to you. Same principle the whole way through.  
---
Unless you're going to leveling forever, it will be a minor inconvenience at best.  
---
I just remember a ton of drama because death knights were originally called a hero class, so people thought DK’s made other melee classes obsolete 
---
There are a very reasonable number of 2Her quest rewards as you level, no real reason to gimp yourself to prevent competition. Plus with a healer and a big 2Her once you get Sweeping Strikes you can pull and kill two mobs at a time really efficiently. 
---
Because he expects us to believe that instead of using one of endless sick boss pictures of ZG, he opted to use a boss from ZA because it looked cool? The votes on his comment are self explanatory.
---
Just own the mistake and don't give some stupid excuse like that. I've already said i respect Tips hustle above, idk why you godda be a whiny fan boy about perfectly legitimate criticism.
---
&gt;More that pirate server players seem to have an emotional need to caricature everyone who played real vanilla as implausibly incompetent, based on cherry-picked data.
---
The fact that the guy's rotation is completely incorrect is not an emotional caricature, it's a fact. There's also the fact that pretty much every Vanilla video features people who are doing things very wrong.
---
&gt;Your reasoning seems to be "I can identify ways individuals in old videos made some mistakes. Therefore this explains absolutely all discrepancies between pirate server performance and real vanilla performance". But like the other dude, I think you are trying to explain a mountain with explanations that suit a molehill. Some dude forgetting slice and dice or a warrior wasting some rage doesn't explain a 300% difference in raid outcomes.
---
If you're limiting your argument to MC speedruns, you should address the fact that there don't seem to be any videos from retail Vanilla where the raid is actually going hardcore in regards to buffs and raid composition (as in doing an actual speedrun by optimizing performance, not just spending less time pissing around and calling it a speedrun). Do you have any videos like that?
---
&gt; A good replacement is blacksmithing if you are hardcore pvp
---
Can you fill me in on the item from BS that contributes to PVP? Serious question.  
---
You’ll be fine because the Paladin will get Verigan’s Fist in the 20s and that will last until you get WW in the 30s. 
---
After that, just switch on and off. 
---
You get 2 handers from quest rewards so it doesn't matter
---
DW leveling is ok though, do it if you want to.
---
&gt;I worry that, if sharding is necessary in the starting zones, it will also be necessary in zones like The Barrens.
---
And that's..... bad?
---
Why would being able to quest around razor hill, see a few people, and complete quests; but then go to the barrens and be tab-spamming to hit a plainstrider unable to complete more than 3 quests an hour be a good thing?
---
This sub is a joke if you elitists think 50% of people, who paid to play classic wow, will quit after level 10. You're jerking yourselves off and look ridiculous doing it. 
---
Lastly, if your individual idea of "vanilla principles" is being literally unplayable; i'll repeat what i said on a different thread.
---
"i hope blizzard makes non-sharded servers at launch so you all can enjoy the crap experience by yourselves while the rest of us can play the game we've waited over a decade for".
---
Honestly, I think a raptor would be better than a cat if not for the cats having a dash ability. 
---
It’s actually a decent hub at that level. I know it sounds ridiculous, but getting a level/level and a half from a single hub and they’re all close proximity quests makes it worthwhile for the trek most times 
---
I've never experienced shading before, will it be me and say 5 other people in one shard or like me and 50 other people?
---
Not entirely sure how I feel about this.  Itemization was soooo terrible early in Vanilla. 
---
With the loot trading system if you need on something does it not bind to you?
---
You're boned.  
---
I'm not even going to suggest my strategy because you're in a crap situation all around.  
---
Best bet is convince him he doesn't need Verigan's Fist - theres a nice two handed sword in Duskwood.
---
Saves escorting him to horde territory.
---
If by ”a few” you mean like 50% of them, yes :p
---
(At least until later)
---
1 fight. In Naxx. That is your argument for 440 defense?! You can def cap for that fight if you need to but you won't want it for 90% of fights.
---
I wouldn't really worry about min/maxing like that..play what you enjoy. I've had the same thoughts (currently trying to decide between Warrior/Rogue/Shaman) about rolling a Mage and while they are a lot of fun, I really think at some point you will regret not going for the "in your face" style of class, even if it will be harder, won't get as much gold, etc. It's like picking a race, some classes are clearly better being a certain race but at the end of the day you have to enjoy what you are looking at/doing. 
---
That being said, if you feel like you could enjoy a Mage as much as a Warrior/Rogue/Hunter then by all means do it! It will just suck getting to level 30 or so and saying to yourself "Damn, I really wish I made a Warrior/Rogue/Hunter instead". 
---
You can't magically tell when someone is abusing it or not. You would be the clueless dude getting taken advantage of.
---
Such great memories of something similar - all nighters of WOW near the holidays really felt like treating myself and letting me unwind. 
---
Depends on the markup.  If you’ve got monopoly power, sure you can charge 1000g, and some idiot will probably pay it, but you could just as easily charge 100g and enchant for 10 people.    Really depends on how magnanimous you feel like being, but hey!  Monopoly power!
---
On the other hand, lots of people just expect free crafting services.  Screw those guys.  
---
10k would be fine.
---
I think either system can be abused right? How will not having loot trading not be abused?
---
Later summer maybe? This way you don’t end up on vacation before the game release. Are you taking 4 weeks in one clip? Maybe Mid-July to Mid-August?
---
There's a trinket that makes you immune to fear for 30 seconds. Pretty nutty if you are not undead.
---
Simple answer is; most likely not. Because that’s just another thing on the huge pile of not-the-most-important things to focus their attention on. 
---
Which starting zone has the biggest "Threat from over the hill"?
---
I'd say Tauren. They have a whole encampment in a fortified position on their doorstep.
---
Humans have Defias raiding their vineyards, big whoop.
---
Tied
---
Well, pre-buff loot is apparently important, why wouldn't pre-nerf bosses be?
---
I listen to the classic OST a lot (on Spotify) 
---
Elwynn Forest is my go to when i'm feeling a bit stressed at work etc. The immersion from the music alone is insane!
---
Judging from what I know about Inkarnate (I've used the free version) it may be a little hard to properly pull off; but Duskwood might be interesting. 
---
Lol what? You assume the server just launched and the person following the guide didnt stop to eat lunch after work... Youre funny.
---
Why not? Well because the vast majority of the 'nerfs' were bug fixes or changes to make encounters actually beatable. The original raids were released in a ridiculous state that clearly hadn't been tested properly and were just thrown together so they could put it on the box as a feature. I doubt anyone wanting to go back to their original state ever played them like that.
---
Niiice. I think I partially remember this.  
---
You know what I didn't realize until you mentioned it? That the bloodvine set requires tailoring to wear. I thought it was just BOE gear anyone could wear. Insane since I wore the damn set in vanilla.  
---
I’d say final week of July forwards. If it comes out sooner you’ll get to play for all of it. The consensus seems to be that it will release before Aug 27 because that’s when some BfA thing releases (iirc). 
---
Even if I had one to pull out; gonna be laptop this time. 
---
Well I mean, what about the famous nerf to Ragnaros's HP?
---
That's a bug?
---
But is it Horizon Zero Dawn worthy of graphics ? That's the kind of upgrade I'm talking about.
---
I mean.. yes, we will have the odd person here and there feeling like as if he/she has the right to get items you don't feel like trading, and he might bug you about it in whisper. But is the trade-off really worth it? Ninja looting was absolutely terrible in vanilla.
---
I think it's really nonsensical to bring up the utility the class provide because it is obvious that you bring enough for the utility no matter what. You make a raid where you get all the utility, then ask what you get for the last 15 dps
---
Not that high
---
And you are only focusing on the prebis portion of my statement. The rest still stands.
---
If the healers can keep you up, you dont need 440 defense. If you are going 440 defense just to make healing easy af,  you are gimping your threat and raid dps for no reason. 
---
You can't have 440 def and reasonable threat until BWL gear at the earliest. Even then, you won't be hit capped. Your threat with 440 defense will have your mages and warlocks wanding for half the fight in AQ. 
---
Agreed on all points.
---
My comment was agreeing with the guy speaking out against flying.

A lot of people expect to get something for nothing, since they're giving you the mats. They of course haven't considered the personal trouble you'd gone to to train up your skill and learn the rarer recipes. Personally if I'm making pots for someone and it's a standard recipe, I won't charge. If they give me a tip then I thank them for being a good customer. If they needed a flask or something from a hard to get recipe, then yeah I'll be up front about it and ask for a fee. I think it's pretty fair that way.
---
&gt; Now, I'm turning 27, have a full time job, own a home and live with my fiance, and only have time to play 20ish hours a week. ... only for 3ish hours in a single session. 
---
I'm in my 40's, wife and 2 kids, and am lucky to get in 5-10 hours a week! I'll probably go hunter/warlock for leveling speed, just for a chance to maybe hit 60 one day - never level capped in Vanilla or even TBC - altaholic. 
---
Really want to play a priest tho as I like healing, shadow priest with Spirit Tap might be able to level ok?
---
Pray that Blizzard will provide us with a release date before Friday.
---
THIS IS WHY WE NEED ANSWERS BLIZZARD, you can't just say summer and leave it at that until the last month. I love you guys in the classic team but people will be missing out if you don't announce the date as soon as possible.
---
I appreciate classic things, but there is no chance I'll touch a CRT monitor ever again.
---
No, contribuing absolutely nothing besides trying to belittle someone while simultaneously taking “everyone” literally is being a dick, and judging by how literally “everyone” perceives you, you are an asshole. 
---
Pretty safe to assume that whatever changes were made by patch 1.12 will be in the game and none beyond that. 
---
Levelling with DW has a big problem in the form of hit chance. Before you get +hit gear, i.e lvl 60, if you’re fighting things of your own lvl and above you’re really just gonna be missing a loooot. 
---
Just go with a 2h, there are plenty to go around. 
---
Bloodvine does NOT require tailoring to wear, however you do need tailoring(300) to get the +2crit in the set bonus. 
---
This is why you never roll horde. :V
---
Waiting as long as possible to plan my
---
Summer vacation as well. 
---
this sort of makes warlock the powerful class and mages the pawns to fill the cracks in my eyes but agree to disagree 
---
One and the same. 
---
They've already confirmed 16 buff slots. Given that, ignite must be shared and therefore be typical vanilla style rolling ignites. So your "most likely" is completely off. Besides, it doesn't do high damage at all when considered it is 1 debuff from all mages combined. It's not like each mage is rolling a 3k ignite simultaneously.
---
But yes, outside of rolling ignites, overaggroing on PW is very unlikely regardless of TPS by the tank himself.
---
Haha but to truly experience Classic wow you need to pull out the electric hog. 
---
I think I took like 5 months to hit 50. Granted I had leveled my professions to max, learned almost every engineering recipe including the useless ones, full discovery almost every area and scored every flightpath. I just loved fooling around and doing anything but what I was "supposed" to do.
---
Yes you will take each others gear if he is going retri. But on the plus side for you, staffs are not bad for warriors. Aslong as the speed is 3.0+ and high min/max damage you dont care what stats there is or weapon type.
---
But dont level as DW, its bad because of low hit. I suggest 2h for leveling. Thats what ive had easier time leveling as.
---
But you want to make it as easy as possible, you go arms+ sweeping strikes and he is healing you. 
---
Ohh well then that's what I was seeing.  
---
What's wrong with if the whole group hit greed then its tradeable/sellable/auctionable. If someone hit need then it becomes soulbound to the winner?
---
I tried both ele and enhance,
---
ele blows the shit out of enhance after 40 imo, but prior ele doesn't really do much aside maybe the reduced mana cost of spells and clear casting just to reduce the amount of drinking.  Flurry is pretty big for helping grind out mobs.
---
I've had quite a few requests for duskwood now - there arent alot of assets for graveyards/tombstones/just genuine gloomy things, But I'll give it a go when I get home after work and post it for you :)
---
People spending time in Silithus = post CC/AQ content patch.
---
lvl 60 Warlock kicking butt in a pink dress post AQ = definitely Vestments of Shifting Sands.
---
We casters may be ugly, *but at least we're not Paladins!*
---
Hateful strikes hit off tanks if I remember( the next 2 highest health player) for about 6-7k, while beating the shit out of your tank. I don’t think hateful strikes hit the main tank.  So the main tank still has to hold agro above the raid because the off tanks won’t be able to build the threat as needed. That was my assumption of that fight.  I healed it so I just look at squares. 
---
Fresh servers is a private server mentality and it's unlikely that blizzard will consider making fresh servers instead of something else.
---
Like I said - it seemed with what Inkarnate had to offer it'd be a very difficult one. None the less I would love to see your interpretation. 
---
But horde tank imbalance tho
---
Really? Because the graveyard is right at the north west of this area. Not a bad run at all.  
---
Honestly, fuck respeccing. I hate that shit. I'm gonna settle on a build for my characters that's good at pvp/pve and at least passable for the other and just stick with it. I'll manage my raiding expectations thusly, but I really like perfecting my chosenbuild and sticking with it.
