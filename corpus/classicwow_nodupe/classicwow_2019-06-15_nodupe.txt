The Warlock cinematic would be 10 minutes of the players looking directly at the portal and not clicking.  And then messages flowing in from other players requesting summons over and over.  In a split screen, you could show someone walking to the dungeon in the same time, then hearthing before they got there and requesting a summon after getting a cosmetic pet out of the bank
---
It is annoying to get banked while leveling by 60s but imo suffering through it is totally worth it because once you get to 60 for the rest of the time you play (years) its a more interesting game with more to do.
---
what nonsense are you talking. warrior have a role they are boss in and that is tanking. that they can also be #1 dps and go around 1 shotting other classes in pvp whilst every other class pays the tax of being ok at 2 things but master of none is a huge balance problem in vanilla
---
I farmed exalted with AV on Nost, and although I am not a fan of PvP in general, or that version of AV (however accurate it was), it was a fucking accomplishment and a relief to finally be done with that fucking place.
---
It was so fucking dificult, you could never get anything done by yourself and even killing the dam archers in the towers were a massive pain in the ass.
---
It got tedious after a while , but when you made exalted you felt like you earned the rewards, while this just seems exactly like the same braindead zerg that AV has been on retail for the past 12 years
---
I'm a Cata baby and can finally see that I truly did start halfway down the slide. I can't wait to see the view from the top!
---
Please link to high res.
---
He was farming which takes like no effort. So why would he focus so much on min maxing his healing output when it didnt even matter that much? Especially when hes gonna do that for hours
---
Unless you're just ganking lowbies or people in far worse gear for you, you're going to need at least 3 finishers per fight, and 4-5 is not unusual against a tougher class. Over 4 finishers the talents return you 100 energy and 3 combo points over each fight. They are very obviously great talents, mandatory even, for any pvp spec rogue.

I know portals have a reagent but couldn't you just but it from a vendor?  And food conjuring took a reagent?  I don't remember that.
---
You are misunderstanding relentless strikes at least it sounds like it from the way you worded it. With 5 cp you are getting 25 energy. Not a chance at it you are for sure getting it. 4 cp is 80% chance at 25 energy, 3 is 60% so on and so forth. 
---
As far as a single talent point goes relentless strikes is pretty close to best bang for buck for rogue.
---
cross-realm BGs are essential if you don't want absurdly long queue times.

This looks 100% official. Awesome work!

---
This topic tends to get responses from players who talk for the sake of talking, but would never actually put their money where their mouth is.
---
The fact is, *statistically,* players choose the realm where their faction is over-represented. Therefore, time and time again, when players are given free transfers, or are notified of balance (via realmpop), it makes faction imbalance worse and worse.
---
This is why the only solution to this problem is either a draconian measure like forcing people to only make new characters on imbalanced realms, or creating auto-balancing, cross-realm zones.
---
Fucking awesome
---
Regarding Respec: Expensive respecs are a major factor in Classic WoW. The idea was that you might want to respec every now and again for a change of pace, or because you got some new gear, or some new content came out. Specifically, it WASN'T for players to play multiple specs with the same character all the time.
---
If you want to play heal and DPS with the same character, try a mixed/hybrid spec that takes bits of both. Similar deal for raiding vs. PvP. Or Group vs. Solo content (something a lot of Warriors did was a mixed Arms/Prot spec, which got the key tanking talents then put the rest in Arms for Mortal Strike). Dual Spec killed this.
---
Regarding Meeting Stones: Forcing players to travel the open world is key to the Classic experience. When players are out in the open world, there are chances for open world interactions. But perhaps even more importantly, it makes the world feel *alive*, because you can see all those other players running around. This is why travel utility is so limited in Classic WoW, and why those travel abilities (like Summoning Portals and City Portals) are important to class identity, and shouldn't be handed out for free.
---
Also, arguing over who should run to the instance and who should be summoned sucks. It even sucks for Warlocks. When everyone wants to stay put and let the other players summon them, it usually ends up taking longer than if you'd all just run there together in the first place.
---
My guild had a guy name Grunster. He was a guy in his mid 50s or so who owned a car dealership and he was hilarious. He was also the hero of stranglethorn vale. Almost every night he would patrol the zone and wait for someone to complain about getting ganked. He would then come to their aid. One night our whole guild came to help him so an entire alliance guilde came to oppose him and bloody war ensued.

if i wanted to play retail av i'd play retail av

Fuck yeah I did you pencil ankle safari giraffe

Sick of them? It isn’t yet another clip of a streamer doing something mundane, complaining about streamers, posting a screenshot of your disabled beta button on the launcher, or giving your opinion on layering, so no. Not sick of these.
---
*a wild White Knight aopears*
---
It's almost fascinating how unaware they are at times. Anyone with reasonable foresight could have thought to release a mini announcement beforehand or located somewhere on the launcher.

ChromedDragon are you interested in theorycrafting a Post-Classic expansion/patch

I am a fan of higher server pops, and still.
---
Cross-server BGs were not a part of the majority of vanilla, so you would actually recognize the same people in your BGs as you would meet out in the open world, which is part of the server community.
---
I don't really PvP that much so I wouldn't really care if they keep cross-faction or not, but I would prefer it if Blizzard didn't have it, as that was the case for the majority of vanilla.

On that one he showed.  On the others the mobs just disappear.  In the first video, I am sure I saw another person at the end.
---
That sounds oddly familiar. What server?
---
Depends on what run you do but ultimately Vanilla didn’t really hold your hand at all in terms of cash. You had to work for it.
---
Did you find out what class he's rolling?

&gt; Nowadays term zerg is used in mmo games to describe force consisted of large group of [**lower level**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lower%20level) players (often with only basic equipment) who use numbers rather then strategy to defeat the enemy, therefore requiring no skill. This tactics is commonly known as [**zerging**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zerging)

This topic tends to get responses from players who love to give self-righteous opinions but would never actually put their money where their mouth is.
---
The fact is, *statistically*, the majority of players prefer realms where their faction is over-represented. Not 50/50. Over-represented.
---
When players are given free transfers, or are notified of balance (via realmpop), it makes faction imbalance even worse.
---
This is why the only solution to this problem is either a draconian measure like forcing people to only make new characters on imbalanced realms, or creating auto-balancing, cross-realm zones. Relying on players “doing the right thing” for faction balance purposes will never work.

Well he's on vacation all of next week as well, I'd go with rogue by the way he stealthed out of here the moment he was off XD

I believe it is when boths teams are rushing to take over towers and defeat the boss
---
&gt;Looks like an old epic tutrle to me right now on Twitch.
---
Not in the slightest, I've watched a few games and most of them seem to be ended in less than 20 minutes, which was possible on Nost. But it required co-ordination because there was no fucking way you could get past the elites or mine-layers by yourself.
---
If players manage to turtle their base (which is also possible on retail) it doesn't really mean anything. Its the PvE aspects of the battleground that seems just way too nerfed for my taste and will make the BG play completly different than the earlier version of AV.
---
And yet tranq shots will still get missed on Flamegor and Chromaggus
---
I work nights so there's nothing to do when I get home. I play private servers or other interesting games at the time or watch YouTube for 6-7 hours after I get home. 
---
I don't live with my gf anymore, and since I work nights I don't get to hang out with the baby except for weekends really. So I'll have lots of time for wow. Wish I could be with the baby more but can't do anything about it.
---
Does it mean we are in AV beta only or full beta once servers are up?
---
When did the onion just become news?
---
I heard they cut the penis off, I've got [sources.](https://img.cinemablend.com/filter:scale/quill/d/2/3/6/7/c/d2367ccd99b74e535ead1f9a9854fabc4f2b944b.jpg?mw=600)

There is a race in starcraft called Zerg. They were unique as they had cheap but weak units. You were able to create a big army very cheaply and flood - or Zerg - the opponent.

They added fest to the end for flavour

Well that sucks ass... at least we get cool perks at level 30 when we reach wizard status right?

Because disc was meant to be melee priest spec originally.

Haha, best one yet!
---
BIG QUESTION: Male Dwarf or Female Dwarf Hunter? In terms of Asthetic and voice.
---
Its good, I don't know the maths but I think orc is still better.
---
And even if Draenei/Humans (not really that great either since melees suck in TBC) have decent passives, horde just have better overall.
---
Its why they gave humans that OP as fuck racial in WotlK so all the pvpers would play alliance, and PvE stuck to horde.
---
Honestly, reverting to the original AV and maybe rebalancing the amount of honor you get from kills and objectives would be the only change I would be okay with. It's outside the open world and was still in vanilla, so I feel like it would be a defensible change.
---
Few things.
---
1) I don't see any way of actually getting into this zone, apart from swimming or taking a boat.  
---
2) This zone is *long*. About as long as Darkshore is. I don't think this should be a pre-mount zone because what's worse than the travel time of Darkshore is the travel time of Darkshore two zones in a row.  
---
3) Can you tell us anything about the zone? What sorts of mobs would we find here? What did you have in mind for that dungeon?
---
ghost wolf and travel form buddies!
---
Thanks for the reply, I'll be considering other options for sure.
---
Mining did not give stamina in Vanilla  that was added in a later expansion.
---
If mining was recommended it was probably because it was the most profitable gathering perfession, so you could have extra money to buy mats for Tailoring.
---
Because he was slowing down the group being out of mana every packs, check any resto druid healing in dungeons they don't get oom and use heals more carefully
---
YES! i love this 1 person alive and the RNG gods witness your greatness and reward you
---
No joke, you're supposed to weave melee between spells. You'll notice in TBC they even gave Moonkin form chance to gain mana (based on AP) on hit. It's a ~~battle mage~~ thunder chicken.
---
One thing I remember hearing requests for even back in Vanilla, was a Scarlett Crusade raid.
---
Very sorry to hear that but out of curiosity sake what's your email and password?
---
I hope people are reporting things like this so proper tuning can take place...
---
As a Warrior a Shaman is always welcome into my groups.
---
If you want good pvp try others mmos. WoW pvp is absolute trash and always will be. No real CC no real crowd control no rank rewards besides shitty gear you can get elsewhere.
---
There is far to much focus on which level you are which gear you have and what class you play. Not much in terms if group setups either. 
---
If you want to find better pvp mmos then hit me up with a PM.
---
Ok well either way that farming isnt a good way to judge his skill so you cant base it off that
---
That could be interesting. Like there could be a lore reason to only have it for a period of time, and then you have to give it back to an NPC so they can give it to another player. If you don't, you can get a letter in the mail saying some NPC faction/group raided your bank and took it by force, and took a fee as well. It might seem cheesy and unfair if you forget but I see it as a cool roleplaying aspect the game really needs.
---
No reason you couldn’t. Spec omen of clarity and get free spells all over the place
---
Wales seems beautiful enough
---
Rogues had their huge revamp in 1.12, so nobody is actually playing the Vanilla version of Rogues.
---
Are we picking and choosing the version of 1.12 we want now?
---
Wyvern sting is pretty good in WSG actually if you're playing in a premade, seen a couple of good hunters play it in serious games but in world pvp you're better off just going scatter.
---
I dunno that orc is that much better. Sure maybe for personal dps but 1% hit is raid wide. That’s a larger dps increase than any other racial. Granted you only need one. 
---
If they had just left weapon skill as it was in vanilla the faction imbalance wouldn’t have been so bad overall for pvp it still would but PvE would be more alliance favored.
---
RIP Ocean Death Warp into Moonglade
---
Had a warlock roll need on Shadowfang and he equipped it
---
Auto-attacks. are what skills are weaved around. I believe each class has their own variant of auto attacks.
---
All classes have an auto melee attack.
---
Hunters are unique in having a ranged auto attack.
---
So can every class weave skills in between their auto attacks? Yes... but is it worth it?
---
With most melee yes, also with hunters yes. With every caster... not really. 
---
Casters generally can almost always hit harder then their auto attacks even with their weakest spell.  Which is why it's not really worth it.
---
They are not launching with the 1.12 system , certain items may not be in the game (like ST quests might not be, dungeon sets upgrades), certain raids aren't out.
---
The game is not \#nochanges its a custom version of 1.12.1, so its basically whatever the fuck they want with it. So imo (just an opinion) they should have the old AV which was in the vast majority of vanilla (which also affect how fast you can get the unstoppable force etc).
---
As a future Shaman in Classic, this has me worried
---
I was worried about that whole "soul binding" business. You want to do WHAT to my soul?
---
Where are these statistics? I find it hard to believe that because I worked at a LAN center for years and frequently saw people come in with friends and roll on servers in Vanilla
---
The vast majority would be quick to go for the faction that's Underrepresented on a server. Faster BG queues. Less competition from your own faction etc etc.
---
Amazing how everyone on this subreddit was level 60 and remembers perfectly vividly the landmine mechanic that was in the game only from June 2005 to October 2005.
---
It takes like 7 days /played to reach 60 
---
There is no post content.
---
No point in rushing the game at all in 2019
---
Naxx will be on farm in a couple months after release.
---
People will buy runs.
---
Everyone will be geared.
---
Game over.
---
There is no real fix though.  If they go early AV, pvp gear requiring Marks of AV will be incredibly hard to obtain because you only got them when the game ended.  If they go late-AV, AV is now shit but gear will be easier to get.  And they can't do a workaround (different reward system that gives Marks every X number of honor kills or tower kills or something with bonus Marks at match completion) because /#nochanges.
---
Yes.
---
That's all well and good, but after a while, the immersion gets broken when the "Champion of the Alliance" can go in with 40 people to take down the legendary Old God C'Thun, but would die if he dared to take on a badger in Pandaria.  
---
When the player is put in focus as extremely powerful in the narrative, the expectations change and shit looks really weird and takes you out of the immersion.  Being immersed in the fantasy setting is pretty important.
---
&gt;Sure maybe for personal dps but 1% hit is raid wide.
---
I am pretty sure it was group-wide only
---
&gt;still would but PvE would be more alliance favored.
---
I think horde had better racials in vanilla as well, but Alliance had paladins (which are probably the strongest healers in lategame vanilla), and casters also became more viable towards the later stages of vanilla which might have had an impact.
---
But as soon as Horde gained paladins, its no longer a competition.
---
Wearing the same shirt for a week straight is the only way to experience that authentic vanilla feeling.
---
I remember before legion dropped I was in the best shape of my life because I hadn't played WoW in so long and was instead wasting time running and doing sit-ups and shit.   
---
3 weeks ago I was so bored with games I started to do my exercise routine again in my spare time.          
---
Without WoW I'd be a much more physically attractive person (as much as a turd can be polished) but probably with the social skills and personality of a dead fish.
---
100% agreed with anewe.
---
they did lost the data.
---
[mark kern](https://clips.twitch.tv/AntsyHeartlessPepperWholeWheat)
---
also if you check blizzard's patch notes you will see that the only patch notes missing are those from [vanilla and tbc](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/).
---
anyway i agree that this is trivialized content and it will hurt the game. 
---
following the same logic they probably wont retune mc and onyxia and, with 1.12 talents, these raids will probably be cleared on the second reset.
---
gonna be a lfr version of vanilla and everyone will be asking "why was this considered hard? probably they had shit computers back then"
---
:)
---
How's the tier 3 subscriber life?
---
Right now it's level 58 premades that have XP locked just to test AV. Can't leave capital city. Only AV. aV or die.
---
Xrealm was literally in 1.12 which is what the game is lol
---
what changed for horde making them better in pve for bc? i agree with pvp but horde isnt pve centered
---
&gt;Are we picking and choosing the version of 1.12 we want now?
---
Yep, absolutely. Otherwise we would have had progressive classic servers with patches, but its a custom version of 1.12.1 with certain content gated.
---
So its actually exactly what we are getting, and why the \#nochanges argument makes no sense at this stage.
---
I don't judge his overall skills I am saying that he plays resto (he is probably better at other specs idk) in an ineffective way, and since he was bitching about resto being shit and being oom every pack its annoying and gives a bad image of resto druid to his audience, hence why my first message
---
Yes they do, 100% 
---
Although vs rogue/war/mage of same skill and gear most likely warlock would trail just behind along with hunter.  This does not mean warlock dps is shameful like ret paladin.  Warlocks also bring a ton of utility, health stones, summoning, banish and probably lots more that I don't know cause I never played lock.
---
Warlocks are also arguably the best PvP class.
---
Ikr lol fkin idiots on this sub man can't just be happy w anything
---
Yeah, all versions of Alterac Valley sucked. If it were the early versions those would look exactly the same just with more RNG one shots from the mines and those dumb roaming packs of elites. People talking about how cool it was that they could play a game of AV before school come back from kindergarten and the game would still be going will be sick of it after the first AV weekend.
---
Druid is the new father's friend. Second fastest leveling, low gear dependence, stealth, and tank those 5 mans so you don't spend forever trying to get a group.
---
yes
---
You’re not having the pure OG vanilla experience if you haven’t players WC3 yet.
---
So I am like 99.9% sure I am correct about this but there is a possibility I am remembering this wrong.
---
Every mob that is 3 levels higher than you or more has a chance to crush you, regardless of defense. It is because this is based on level and not defense.
---
The way you push crushing blows off the table is by using shield block.
---
In vanilla wow (this was changed in tbc) you could also push critical hits off the combat table by using shield block as well. As long as your total avoidance plus block was higher than 106.4% (I might be remembering that number wrong).
---
And the defense cap is really only hard to reach in pre bis gear. Once you start getting a fair bit of T1 gear it's easy to reach. 
---
All that being said, you actually dont need the defense cap for the majority of vanilla content, you just need to be liberal with the use of shield block to remove crushes and crits. 
---
(Note if you are tanking more than one mob it will eat your shield block charges too fast leaving you vulnerable to crushes and crits)
---
do priests even have the range talents on spells to keep a warrior out of intercept range. i dont think they do
---
He never said resto is shit, he said feral is shit, hence why he's playing resto in the first place
---
The thing is, any moment that "teeny bit of rain" can turn into a torrential downpour.  I was sitting at my desk at work, looked over across the river (nice view so I don't mind the smaller cube), and it was a nice sunny day.  Couple minutes later (maybe five, at most), and it's pouring rain outside.  The hurricane season's when it gets the most fickle with that.
---
But for most people, the rain isn't too big of a bother.  It's kind of a pain to get people to evacuate for a hurricane, because folks just shrug it off like, "Eh, lots of rain, some wind, that's a random day in the summer."  Probably doesn't help that particular issue that where I am (Jacksonville) is in this bizarrely perfect spot to steer hurricanes around it so we hardly ever get hit full-on.  But just the side of a hurricane's enough to make a mess.  Couple years ago the conditions were *just* right, and the rain coming down caused the river to flood up into the surrounding areas.  We couldn't go into work for a couple days or so because the streets were under water.  Sadly, the neighborhood nearby got hit pretty bad by that, and a lot of storefronts are still sitting empty along one road because stores went out of business from having been flooded, and even if it was a freak occurrence, few people want to risk losing everything in a moment.
---
But yeah, the threat of rain and storms is pretty real.  Local NFL team even built an indoor practice facility not so much to avoid the heat and humidity, but because too many practices would get cancelled due to the weather making it unsafe to play outside.
---
When it's good, it's great.  When it's bad, it's a nightmare.  And it can change in a moment's notice.  My favorite photo that represents it (can't find it with a quick Google search) is someone sitting in their car looking at beautiful sunny skies ahead of them, but there's a ridiculous storm behind them in their side mirror.
---
Yeah. That, plus Omen. It was my first time playing vanilla since actual vanilla so I wasn’t doing my best then. I played it as a pure caster. And didn’t have a good time.
---
Where are your statistics? They are both anecdotal.
---
AV on retail takes like 15 minutes. This ridiculous hyperbole will just not get you taken seriously at all.
---
So was Naxxramas, but where is it?
---
Oh right, its gated. Almost as if classic is indeed a CUSTOM version of 1.12.1, and not \#nochanges as its already been \#changed.
---
My fix is to make two versions of AV.  1.12 and 1.ascloseto5asyoucanget.  You have to walk out to TM/SS to queue for OldAV, and it has all the good shit in it.  That way you* can go speed grind your bullshit, and I can go play in my week long wars.
---
\* not actually *you*, or maybe, whatever.
---
Hey man, if you have a minute I would love your feedback on my build. I plan on both raiding and PvPing as hemo. I know hemo isn't considered the best for PvE, but from the napkin math I've managed to do it seems extremely exaggerated how bad it is (if you take into account your hemo helping your raid). Anyways, here's the build:

 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheMohZhbV0bZtMeo0hoo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheMohZhbV0bZtMeo0hoo) 
---
1. Is the hit and imp. sprint worth not taking CB and other mid tier assassination talents?
---
2. If I do end up going the hit talent, is there any cool item choices you might know if that I can take since I basically only need 3% hit on gear?
---
3. How important is imp sap? Is it worth dropping some points I have for like a 2/3 imp sap?
---
4. Are there any competitive maces I can use? I know of Ironfoe, but that might be a little out of reach for me, time-wise.

**Unpopular opinion time:**
---
Old AV is fun once. As soon as people figured it out it becames the same 40v40-run-past-each-other-and-race-to-the-final-boss. Even when Korrak is a thing people still ended up with this strat.
---
Unfortunately they'd have to really overhaul AV to find a better balance. After nerfing NPC's ( Getting 3 shot by bowmen is not fun) people figured out that the honor per hour was optimized by only putting a few people on defense and rushing the towers/bosses. 
---
The honor gained from farming kills just doesn't compare. And **if they redid the honor formula in AV this sub would freak out over changes. It's a lose/lose for Blizzard.**
---
Imagine if a single raid took 2 days, and there was a solid 50 percent chance that you fail the whole thing. It's not about instant gratification. It's about an already grindy system (honor) potentially being even more grindy just because some people on reddit say they found it more fun.
---
Horde also gets Silverpine Forest which is super underrated.
---
Yes you can.
---
Yeah, the rewards system was the real problem.  Also when pvp gear got added, you needed "Marks of Alterac Valley" to get some gear and you got 3 for a win, 1 for a loss.  So nobody wanted long AV's since they wanted the gear.  But if the rewards system had been changed so you got rewards *as* you played, long matches wouldn't be such an issue.
---
If you actually played private servers that try to mimic the earlier versions, you'd know that most people absolutely _loathe_ pre-nerf AV there...
---
No you wouldnt do this.  Your spellls dont have a cooldown. So you charge up the next one instantly - anything else is a DPS loss.  
---
Hunters would spam Aimed shot if it Didnt have a CD.
---
haha, can't believe forgot the entrance
---
I was thinking a path from darkshore at the shore, and one into felwood past the troll village 
---
also in terms of getting around, i was thinking a non-instanced ferry ride between lor'danel and auberdine to help a little with that
---
Did someone actually get paid to write that shite?
---
&gt;Just have a little 47% A / 53% H next to the server name?
---
that would be great. but as some has brought up it might compund the problem, people dont want to choose the "loosing" side so they roll Horde in this case, since they are 53%
---
I would like blizzard to try it out, display the A/H faction balance on certain realms and see what the human head does with those numbers.
---
Short answer: yes  
---
Long answer: Since warlocks bring more utility than mages to raid in the form of summoning, health candy, their curses, and imp, they have less top end dps when compared to mages. This is evident early in raiding. Towards the end of raiding (AQ40/Naxx) warlocks really start to shine in one the dps meters.  
---
You're going to be spamming Shadow Bolt for almost the entirety of their raiding career in classic. Because of the debuff limit, you'll only really be able to have up a single curse and among the other warlocks in the raid, you may have one or two slots allocated for Corruption.   
---
The theoretically highest dps spec for warlock in DemoSac/Ruin. There are arguments for using SM/Ruin, but we're talking about a 10% damage increase from Shadow Mastery to a 15% shadow damage increase with DemoSac.  
---
If you want to guarantee a raid spot, raid as MasterDemo/Ruin. Its a build that gives up dps for raid utility in the form of improved Healthstone and Improved Imp. Trust me, tanks will fight for you to be in the raid with this spec.   
---
I raided a warlock all throughout Vanilla WoW. It was a fun experience and I'd do it again if I was serious about completing endgame content again.
---
Damn you stole a mount!

nobody in this thread appears to be under the impression that they are doing this ironically
---
I think when people said "housing" they meant something more communal.
---
Imo horde in vanilla has better racials for pvp alliance for PvE. Can’t top human weapon skills for melee. Add in fear ward for dorf priests. Into bonus for gnomes. Hard to top those in PvE. Pvp it’s basically flipped the other way.
---
The change to weapon skill basically made alliance weaker in PvE racials add in that all priests got fear ward you eliminated a lot of the alliance racials. Add in removing the debuff on orc racial as well as adding spell power too. Tilts it the other way.
---
Seriously, first there was that bug after the first stress test where some people were still able to log in and get a server list, leading many to believe they had been given access. Then they take the button away completely, now they give the button back without any word, but you can't click it. I mean COME ON GUYS. We're dying out here, and my time passes a lot better when my child-like fantasies of ever getting into this beta aren't enabled by you savages.
---
I wish it was 20s.  I think it’s more like 6-8s
---
“I wish Blizzard just let me do what I want in their Beta instead of forcing me to test what they need to ensure a smooth launch.”
---
Maybe everyone that doesn’t participate in AV weekend should just have their beta access permanently revoked.
---
I just tried it on pirated servers, and it doesn't work.   It resets the swing timer on my staff.
---
Spells reset the swing timer. Wand is on the GCD. 
---
Casters can dot—&gt;alternate melee swings with wand swings, but I don’t think it’s too effective.
---
Can't decide male Dwarf or female Dwarf Hunter? In terms of aesthetic and voice. (I know that female dwarf rogue's voice is pretty annoying when she says "not enough energy")
---
I vote male
---
I feel like living here's prepped me for living in England if I ever do move there, aside from the temperature (today was actually a lovely day that felt nice and cool, but it'd be a "heat wave" in England... not saying that to poke fun, I've seen the BBC bit where they were talking about a "heat wave" and it's this kind of weather).
---
Also already prepped for it by being into good ales and stouts, loving pubs, being into Games Workshop games and Scalextric slot cars, having a soft spot for pool and darts, enjoying tea (without all the sugar people pour in it), watching more British TV than American TV (not just stuff like Doctor Who and Sherlock, but also things like 8 Out of 10 Cats), and having a bad tendency to use British slang instead of American.  (To be fair, due to enjoying GW games, I used to talk to a lot of Brits online, who "tainted" my vocabulary.)  People are more convinced I'm British than Southern.  (Probably doesn't help that I dislike things like grits and turnip greens, and loathe the drawl.)
---
i wouldnt totally agree caster dmg is independant of gear. a fresh 60 warock will not have enough spell power to kill anyone with a rotation of DOTS. but one thing is certain, caster survivablity is heavily gear related. until you can get 3k+ hp you are in one shot territory from rogues, warriors, shaman and mages with trinkets.
---
0/31/20 was my build of choice. Really great for solo defending flags in AB/AV until reinforcement show. Three ways to immobilize a target plus a disorientate is a great way to prolong encounters with melee classes and from Straw Polls, there will be plenty of them.
---
Always liked hunters for that... until they destroyed their talents. Hopped back in and started BFA... mmm
---
These suggestions are brain dead, you already have your game in bfa
---
Ok buddy.
---
I really wish Blizz would take a page from other MMOs and simply restrict creation of new characters for whichever faction has more players above lvl 10 until they even out.
---
Imagine the butthurt if that happened.
---
Feral dps or tank? Feral tank is good and the best tank for rushing dungeons actually
---
Well its an article from the onion. Isnt that a parody news site?
---
I thought was annoying, but this version will be a complete faceroll and free epics, at a server thats starting off with MC. So thats the issue.
---
And even if you could backdoor or zerg the pre-nerf AV on private server, it still took a while and it was harder to pull-off, because of how powerful the elites were, and you had to deal with shit like the mine layers.
---
And if there was a turtle the game could be prolonged for Korrak etc to spawn, or the bosses.
---
Here is something that helped me get started: 
---
https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;t=16057
---
As someone else said... take everything with a grain of salt. There are some things in that guide that have turned out to be untrue in the beta (i.e. bosses have additional parry). There is a lot you just have to learn on your own. 
---
It's pretty straightforward, but with a lot of depth. However, I guarantee you that it will be frustrated the first time you try to do a 5 man with dps that don't wait for you to build threat/don't attack the marked target/break CC, or just go ham on AOE from the start. Don't worry about it, much of it is their fault. Part of being a good tank is anticipating the chaos and reacting to it. Which sometimes just means letting the dps get shit on. After awhile you kinda look forward to the chaotic moments. 
---
One tip I will give you is learn the interactions between Battle Shout and Demo Shout regarding AOE threat. Also Demo Shout is an incredibly op ability in terms of damage reduction. 
---
Finally... understand that the meta these days may start off as a traditional tank with a focus on damage reduction. But the other part of being a tank is building threat. This is where the DW spec another user linked comes in. It may help to learn what advantages and disadvantages it offers. 
---
Tanking is fun.
---
I wouldn't mind. We're getting all the class revamps from the get go, might as well fix itemization
---
I’m sick of them
---
The dedication would be noteworthy
---
The reason other "casters" don't do it is because they have spammable spells they can cast, which will do more damage than their ranged or melee weapons. Especially when you consider that those spells scale off their spellpower gear, while their autos do next-to-no damage. Auto-attacking also does take some time, .5 seconds I believe, so you give up casting frostbolt/fireball/shadowbolt/mindflay/starfall in order to weave in the auto, which is simply not worth it DPS wise.
---
The reason Hunters do it is because the only "casts" they have in their rotation are Aimed Shot and Multi Shot, and both of those have substantial cooldowns, hence they cannot be spammed. Because Hunters lack a spammable ranged "cast", they make up for it with high auto-attack damage. So not clipping your autos by weaving your "casts" in between them is important since your autos are a major part of your DPS.
---
Using your druid for example, you could:
---
1) Spam wrath, firing one off every 1.5 seconds.
---
2) Weave in an auto-attack in between each wrath, adding a .5 second delay between each but getting the auto-attack damage in.
---
This means for every 3 auto-attacks, you could have instead casted one wrath. At lower gear levels, one AA might very well do more than 1/3 the damage of wrath. But at higher tiers of spellpower gear, one wrath will be easily be worth more than 3 autos.
---
Yeah. I totally get that first part. I think the second part was just salt. Sorry you feel that way man.
---
You Will spec for Holy Power and Blessing of Sanc if you want to have one spec to both heal and farm with. 
---
Separate gear sets, one for healing and one with Return damage.  
---
BoSanc + Ret aura + Shield Spike + Skullflame shield + Consecration. Are the basic.  With this you can do pulls of 10 mobs at the time, and the better gear you get the more youll manage and kill faster. Great way to grind. 
---
In other words, you spec standard Holy but skip Holy Shock and go down to Blessing of Sanc in prot.  Besides - its a good spec for giving BoSanc to tanks when you are healing.
---
August 27th is the only date you need homie.
---
Go on...
---
You're talking about two completely different systems.
---
One is gear + content, the other is actual mechanics, like how threat is calculated, how haste stacks on itself, what spells changes are included and how talent trees changed.
---
What underlying class mechanics are being “picked and choosed” from different patches?
---
That’s what I rolled back in the day. Had a blast with feign death and shadowmeld. Saved me lots of gold on raid wipes.
---
Nor can shamans be druids.
---
That's way worse. Combining servers was one of the worst things to happen to the retail WoW community.
---
Gating Naxxramas is very different from gating complete class overhauls, wtf are you talking about?
---
That's not what back capping means.
---
&gt; Until I am deep in AQ40, I am not going to be wearing tier pieces. And once I enter naxx, still going to be using AQ40 set for hybrid stats.
---
Do Feral sets even exist before then?
---
I’d go rogue personally. If you don’t plan to focus on tanking seriously, you’ll pretty much either be an off tank or a dps with warrior. And if you’re going dps, you mind as well go rogue. And I think rogues are more fun out of the 3, especially for pvp. In the end, it’s up to which one you’d find more enjoyable to play cause you’re the one playing.
---
Male alway had a bit of gruffness in their attacks and audio that I really enjoyed. Although, they didn't make the females sound stupid either, so I don't think you can really go wrong with either.
---
You’re literally the 90th person to post this shit with the same clever title. Use the damn search function or maybe your eyes.
---
This is kind of sad if they couldn’t put all of their dots up...I don’t see a point almost.
---
Will $80 get me a decent rig if I set aside $10 week?
---
everything pre 1990 is boomer tier get on with the times old man
---
&gt; And if there was a turtle the game could be prolonged for Korrak etc to spawn
---
Oh yeah, finally pushing the last graveyard and someone yells "Korrak is up!!!" which makes you lose the last 2 hours of progress as 15 people run middle... 
---
Yeah, people didn't really love that one on private servers either.
---
AV was never about real PvP.  The old version sucked ass, was hugely unbalanced and turned into servers hour long bottlenecks.  Not "PvP" at all you are just running into a bottleneck while half the raid is afk waiting for something to happen and 2-4 people raging in raid chat "RUN PAST HORDE WTF IDIOTS CAP FWGY!!!!"
---
At least with the later Patch's making AV very fast 20-40min games, there was room there for a small group or premades to tilt in their favour and actually do PvP
---
Ie. Mages defending slowing opponent, rogues forward capping, wiping raids at galv or whatever if you had a good premade
---
In my opinion the old AV was just dumb I honestly never finished one start to finish and probably most of you didn't either, how is that PvP?
---
The nerfed AV although not perfect, was still better then mindless running into opponent while half the raid is afk or farming (and I would agree that they should somehow slow down how fast people get exalted, at least make it not available until 2-3 months of MC clear)
---
The best paladins I know go 21/0/30. It has the highest skill cap and utility play for high end pvp. Judgement set is great for it as well.
---
Many pservers have realm populations that are a few times greater than OG vanilla realms. That’s one of the reasons you get ganked all the time.
---
It’s a bit salty to complain about not being able to play beta this weekend when others don’t get to play beta at all
---
The classes aren't, but the content in the game is.
---
Its mostly 1.12.1, but its still a custom version where Blizzard choses what to and not include in the game, so... where should the line be set then?
---
Thats what the discussions are for, and everyone can voice their own subjective opinions on what should be in "classic", as its absolutely not a unchanged version of 1.12.1.
---
I want the game to be as good as it can be, and I would like to see certain things that would make it more "classic" in my perspective, but at the end of the day blizzard picks and choses, which should already pretty well established by now but for some reason isn't.
---
Dimensions: 15000 x 6749.
---
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.
---
Lol yea cant argue that one
---
You increase the honor gains for completing objectives in old AV. You have a passive honor gain every 30 minutes you are active in Alterac Valley.
---
The problem is that this tends to compound faction imbalance and lead to server death. If Horde and Alliance are equally popular, and no other information is given, all servers should tend towards 50/50 over time. There's no particular push, it's just the law of averages.
---
On the other hand, if you show faction ratios, once a server's balance tips one way or another, that server now becomes less desirable. Most new players stop joining it in favour of the ever decreasing number of 50/50 (or close) servers. The only people joining are those with friends on the server - most likely friends of the dominant faction, exacerbating the issue. As players quit, the server's population drops without the steady flow of newbies to support it. Once it becomes significantly imbalanced, gameplay problems begin to appear for the smaller faction, so now players from that faction start to quit or move servers in higher numbers.
---
Unfortunately, due to the inclusion of Cross-Realm Battlegrounds, there is literally no incentive to play the smaller faction on a server. But if there were an appropriate incentive, I would suggest that Blizzard display which faction is larger, but not the difference between them. So you know "this server needs more Horde", but not how badly they're needed. As long as people have a reason to sign up for the smaller faction, this would help balance things out for everyone in the long run.
---
&gt; Its mostly 1.12.1
---
Other than 1.12 content that won't be accessible *yet*, what actual content is going to be in their *pre-*1.12 incarnations and not in their 1.12 version?
---
It's not an all or nothing thing.  You can like part of it and hate other parts.
---
That actually sounds pretty good, thanks. Do you know what that shield usually sells for?
---
&gt; but Korrak and mines were definitely universally hated on private servers.
---
Yep, but it still has a huge effect on the time gearing takes, and on this classic version mages will get that wand for free (which was pretty dam good if not almost BIS if I remember correctly)
---
Can’t kill myself today, my guild is expecting me to show up tomorrow night to raid.

---
Hmm that's a pretty good take. Do you think playing rogue with say a priest or maybe even a druid is worth it over warrior? Are rogues good with casual gear and do they mesh well with a partner or better solo?
---
Where did I mention class overhauls?
---
I am merely stating the fact that this classic WoW is a custom version of 1.12.1
---
I think you are just complaining to complain.
---
I am watching Madseaasons stream right now. They are on 2.5 hour match and they summoned Ivas (sp)
---
THAT is the Pve aspect that we love. . Its going to be fine.
---
Oof I feel this dude, trying to make the same decision. For me it's come down to Hunters slight advantage in wPvP early in the game vs Warlock's extra utility and subsequent increased raid or dungeon spots. 
---
I think it's a personal thing, I would prefer to have the Hunter's toolkit in wPvP than the Warlock's toolkit in a PVE environment cos I like wPVP more than I enjoy raiding (even though I'll be doing both). 
---
In terms of dead-zone, Lock and Hunter are both complex classes to play in pvp (barring SL), so either you'll be investing in learning to play around your deadzone or learning to play around having the wrong pet out, lack of mobility and other aspects of Warlock pvp. 
---
In terms of making friends, there are plenty of ways to make friends in the game outside of providing portals and soul-stones, after the initial hump of finding some early groups, if you're a decent guy (or girl) and are decent at the game you'll create a network which will provide you with groups.
---
TBH i reckon class flavour is going to be the decision maker for me, they are both strong classes in wpvp and solo content, both have raid spots (curses vs tranq and kiting) and both have strong and weak periods on the charts. I do, however, have to spend a fuck ton of time looking at my character so I want to absolutely froth whichever class I pick. 
---
If you're anything like me you'll get fomo either way and spend half the game wishing you'd rolled the other class so just strap in and start leveling your alt homie.
---
What version of Naxxramas is going to be in the game? The 1.12 version, or a previous version?
---
Can you tell me exactly which patch Naxxramas is going to be from?
---
&gt; The whole reason ~~players~~**people who PVP for the loot** preferred the new AV was because it ended much faster meaning they could earn honor faster. The original AV ~~was flawed due to how low the Honor gains were.~~**made those people cry because they don't actually enjoy world PVP or anything remotely close to it, they just wanted their rewards**.
---
FTFY
---
Except they didn't, and don't, corpse camp?
---
I jumped in WoW during WOTLK. Always rolled alliance. Honestly want to jump on when classic comes out and roll Tauren. Still crossed on the class to pick (druid or warrior). Thunderbluff is just too beautiful and the battle cows are the best.
---
Like i dont want them to go that far, ill be rolling with a relatively big group at around 10-15 people, but what if all of us manage to speak one other friend to join, then we're suddenly 25+, but since they joined a month late they cant join our faction because there's a faction imbalance?
---
It's a hypothetical but some would join a month late and not be able to play what faction they want.
---
What does alterac valley have to do with ensuring a smooth launch?  Are bg’s our in phase 1?
---
You’ve never played WoW before...?  How are you here?
---
Swifty is hilarious about it, he plays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrI-UBIB8Jk whenever he thinks hes getting stalked
---
&gt;What actual content is going to be in its pre-1.12 incarnation and not in its 1.12 version?
---
Some loot-tables probably will be (although not the items themselves, as there will be no stat-overhaul).
---
&gt;Having the 1.12 version of Naxxramas in game but inaccessible is not the same as having a 1.11 version of Naxxramas, lol.
---
No, but it will a custom version of 1.12.1 with gating. So if Blizzard is already chosing and picking what to do with their so-called authentic classic wow, why not argue for other changes as well?
---
Yeah, it sucks because warlocks are the dot class. But the debuff limit impacts all classes, just hits us the hardest. Regardless, the highest dps for warlocks is just to spam Shadow Bolt anyways. Again, kinda sucks because we're a dot class.   
---
Meh, it's one of those things about vanilla wow.
---
Wool is available on beta.
---
Huey, Lewis, Thenews
---
I cant recall a single time someone DIDN'T want to do a dungeon run because they had to walk to the entrance. IMO and probably a lot others, walking to the dungeon was as much of a part of the dungeon it self. Dual spec would be nice in some ways but its not at all needed. PvE specs do fine in PvP. Dual spec also doesn't really help classes with multiple roles anyways as most hardcore raiders or PvPers will just have 2 specs dedicated to what they play most, and pay to swap the least used one around.
---
Great post.  You're really rekindling the memories off all of us who were "in the shit".  Very much enjoy your writings.
---
Jokes on them. 3rd grade was \*way\* too young to realize what depression truly was. If I want to truly relive my depression, they have to bring on my 6th grade good times, \*TBC\*.
---
This attitude will kill classic. Classic requires new players from retail or otherwise to stay afloat being toxic to them is a great kill way to rekill our favorite game.
---
No one is going to beta test after the game launches.
---
Sacrifices must be made for perfect balance. You could also re-roll with your friends who started late on a server with the faction you want open so you're all starting at the same level.
---
Blizzard's mistake was trying to make AV cater to the "give me rewards fast" crowd instead of leaving it for the "we love a big-ass WAR/PVPing for the sake of PVP" crowd.  The Skinner Box Kids have Warsong and AB they can play.  They should have left AV for its intended original audience.
---
Why wouldn’t they? They do in retail.  You have no reason to expect otherwise.
---
ok, yea, just say "server needs horde" dont display.  it like 70/30
---
But i do believe the addons now a days can pretty easily figure out the faction balance. And honestly if my server becomes a 70% Alliance 30% Horde thing im quitting instantly.
---
Im mostly interested in world pvp, and with 70% alliance that would be impossible.

&lt;HA&gt; plans to be both a social hub as well as an active raiding guild. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding, but take progressing seriously both in terms of preparation and during raids themselves. We do not aim for server firsts etc, but we do want to steadily progress through and clear all the content.

We aim to maintain a good community of friends without sacrificing endgame progression. We're looking for solid players who want to properly apply themselves to the challenges Classic brings, while also being reliable and social. To us, quality is more important than quantity - but we are welcoming of new people, and will be happy to show and teach you, to help you progress with us. All we ask is that you put effort into it, and have a similar passion for the game as we do.

****************************************************************************
---
We will have 3 days per week dedicated to raiding, with times of 21:00 - 00:00 Server time / 20:00 - 23:00 UK time Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. We require consistent raid attendance, however we will also be understanding if some events make you unable to participate at a given date, as long as you let us know in advance.

Looting will be done via loot council system for 40man raiding, and rolling for 20man raiding (barring a few exceptional items).

We are currently recruiting most classes and roles, and we are always open to non-raiding socials (so you are welcome to bring your friends or family with you!).

Cheers!

This is the best thing to happen to /r/classicwow.
---
I see people say that the honor grind doesn't get hard until level 10 but here we have a very dedicated pvper who maxed at level 10.  I'm beginning the to think all the people saying those things are the kinds of people that say playing 5 hours a day is "casual".
---
&gt; The vast majority would be quick to go for the faction that's Underrepresented on a server. Faster BG queues. Less competition from your own faction etc etc.
---
The devs have talked about the results of past efforts, such as free transfers and the New Player Experience. They talk about data they see on the back end.
---
New players don't pick realms based on fast BG queues. They pick based on what their friends play, and friends who PvP tended to favor one faction (because racials) and friends who PvE tend to favor Horde (because of racials.)
---
More people want to be an OP faction than they care about BGs. People who like BGs are such a small component compared to the rest of the PvE population.
---
&gt;RemindMe! 93 days

They ganked her once before this clip lmao
---
Its probably going to be 1.12 version of Nax unless something changes, and it will also probably be the least affected content in the game as its literally what the entire game is balanced around at this point.
---
Hahaha......awww :(
---
jsut get soylent please don't be ridiculous
---
Rogues are great solo, so if you have a dedicated healer, that’s even better. A rogue that never dies is a good rogue. You’ll probably have to slow down for you healer to catch up and be careful if you’re stealth past stuff that your healer might accidentally pull, but other than that you’ll be golden. You can also make stupid
---
Money as a solo rogue. Once you hit 60, you can solo lower level instances and disenchant blues and sell them for easy money, that was my favorite thing about my rogue in vanilla. He was my money maker. My main was a warrior and it took forever to level solo, the damage just wasn’t as quick as my rogue and it was a slog feast.
---
Asmongold straight up right click reported them because they said "N o H a i r" in say chat.  Asmon is a baby it definitely bothers him
---
Yeah it took 7 months before my guild's first Xbox dropped. The shield took 8 months though :(
---
Idk, he said that feral is good in pve(didnt specify dps or tank) but bad in pvp.
---
don't worry this is the last one
---
OP probably saw 1 premade stomp a pug group and immediately came here to complain.
---
Old AV should come back. Every 30 minutes you get an Honor Bonus for being active in Alterac Valley. The rewards for completing objectives/turnins now give players more honor.   
---
Let's not forget the biggest flaw with Classic PvP. Honor kills give way too little Honor. Compare the honor you gain from killing players to capping 3 flags in Arathi Basin? It is stupid.
---
It's ok though. the #nochanges crowd is helping make 1.12 AV a reality.
---
The PTRs in retail get used by people wanting to test NEW content. Nothing in Classic is new.
---
Except asmongold and sodapoppin the biggest streamers with the most followers
---
&gt; Some loot-tables probably will be
---
Can you show me which ones?
---
&gt; it will a custom version of 1.12.1 with gating.
---
Once again, what content is going to be in a pre-1.12 state?
---
Gating is simply a slower roll-out of 1.12 content than its original pacing. But that content **is still all 1.12.**
---
So I suggest being clear when talking about “custom” version of 1.12. You aren't actually talking about pre-1.12 versions of content.
---
in this situation, battlegrounds would be new.
---
Okay, what version of Molten Core is going to be in the game? 1.12, or are you also going to pretend like this is a “custom mish-mash of various patches of content”?
---
This hit home. I was a human Pally in vanilla (still play him to this day) and I remember standing at the edge of the dock in Menethil Harbor, not quite sure where the boat was gonna take me and not sure if how I would get “home”.  I had wandered north and didn’t really know how to find my way back to Stormwind, so I kinda figured I had nothing to lose, but at the same time I was scared of not returning.
---
I get that feeling every expansion pack, stepping through the portal or getting on the boat, it gives me chills every time, even now as a decidedly less nerdy 27 year old, I still feel the magic in this game.
---
Something worth mentioning is its not that you don’t hit hard, you just don’t hit with a lock. In 5 man groups where you’re not fighting a 63 equivalent so you don’t need the 16% you’re going to crack the shit out of mobs. It’s just you need hit for raid bosses and there won’t be any to find early game.
---
Yeah he has effectively suppressed all of the old stuff he used to say.  Anyone who has played with him on private servers knows what the real StaySafe is like
---
Silverpine is for sure my favorite. Always will be, rolled an undead Warlock in vanilla. A lot of people leave to go play in the Barrens with the rest of them, so theres less competition for mobs and such.
---
Plus it has a Duskwood vibe to it, but its Horde territory so you're all safe and warm in your worgen infested woods.
---
I know, I’m just undecided between Druid or shaman yet mate
---
...
---
We're in a thread where OP doesn't want to login to the only available form of Classic WoW because it's just AV testing and you think people are going to be more likely to do just AV testing once Classic is actually released?
---
Just no.
---
&gt;like everything he says is just parroting Asmongold.
---
Umm thats just not true ... Staysafe has had long arguments with Asmon about classic staysafe comes from a private server background Asmon does not. Asmon wanted to ban snipers for harassment staysafe thinks everything should be fair play. Nice hate mongering ;)
---
It really depends on which class you play, and how much time you spend getting pre-raid best-in-slot gear. I never had any trouble as a shadow priest, even after BWL, nor did I have any issues as a paladin using 5-man blues and PvP gear. (though I did have the exalted AV hammer, which didn't take long to acquire).
---
I also played a mage, and found that weather I won encounters was determined by my situational awareness and skill rather than gear.
---
Probably because this sub is filled with autistic people.
---
PVE servers that way ----------&gt;
---
Healing was all I would do for dungeons and pvp, could never get the hang of dps. With healing you gotta prioritize your mana and all the doods youre keeping alive idk its fun
---
I really like seeing these too!
---
This makes me sad. I had hoped they would do the old AV.
---
-no farming rams to buy mounted NPCs you can charge in with
---
-no flying NPC guards
---
-no wandering guards and lieutenants 
---
-no mines
---
-probably no summoning of the epic Tree and Ice lords.
---
What do you mean by leeway?
---
Trying to convince my friends who I used to play with. None of them want to come back :/
---
Gold ain't that hard to get in Classic and it does get better at higher levels, but you do have to have some sort of hustle and mind your wallet or you will find yourself broke.
---
You don't get money for doing nothing though like in current wow.
---
Why no slice and dice?
---
What server?  Very similar view and experience from me, great post.
---
I want to say the first High Warlord on my server, Nathrezim, was an Undead Mage named Cheeseball
---
alliance lost their biggest advantage in pve which was paladins, horde paladins had seal of blod which was better than the alliance equivilent and many racials where changed in BC mostly which favoured horde
---
Warrior is probably the strongest and most versatile, and scales the best. 
---
Rogue is the best at ganking,   
---
Shaman is viable in pvp, but is more about being disruptive.  I actually think shamans will be better in Classic than they were in vanilla because totem stomp macros don't work.  
---
No matter which class you go, your pvp spec will be drastically different than your pve spec.
---
2 monitors
---
15 years later and I realize I am gladly going to do it all over again.
---
I killed myself because the SuicideAwarenessBot wouldn't stop harassing me.
---
Yeah, this just feels too much like a Cataclysm zone to me.
---
yeah anyone with stress test has the button but can't click, happened right before Av testing started
---
When everyone disagrees with you, you are usually the idiot. Usually.
---
Issue is that there's still no reason to sign up for the smaller faction. The only things they ever had going for them were short BG queue times and less competition for raid spots and PvP ranks. Crossrealm BGs kill the first reason, and a balanced low pop realm is better in every way for the second.
---
But there are still reasons NOT to. Which pretty much means that, if the server is telling you "we need more Horde", the rational player would actually do the opposite and sign up for Alliance (all other things being the same.)
---
Or maybe, just maybe, the reason they nerfed the shit out of it after just a few months post-launch was because the battleground was horribly unpopular to the point where queues were simply not popping anymore on most servers.
---
Even on private servers with 8k+ population, alterac valley stops popping after a few months when everyone has gotten their rewards. This crew that "love a big-ass war" is not big enough for a 80 man battleground.
---
Ah ok,  thanks
---
Murko-matic-Bubble. Most players PvP only for the gear rewards. Very few are actually like you. Blizzard should have fixed the honor gains in Old AV to make players more interested in playing it.
---
Old AV was great, because it felt like a World PvP zone. The lack of honor from killing players and don't the objectives was the biggest issue. Why not award players every 30 minutes with an honor amount while in Old AV.
---
You'll be healing in raids and speed running 5/10 man's to gear up your newbies/ Alts in the guild.
---
Probably lock but warriors a close second choice.
---
Instant spells don't though, do they?
---
They're the wrong way round
---
&gt;“custom mish-mash of various patches of content”?
---
Yes, because you are modifying the game then you are customizing it.
---
So my argument is that it is already a custom version of 1.12.1, and you are saying its limited customization (because the classes and most numbers are static).
---
So I would like to see a bit more customizationg to make it more authentic with people relate with "classic wow" as oppose to some already customized version of 1.12.1.
---
and if I could make the calls, I would have them do progressive classes/itemization etc. as well, but if thats not an option they should follow the experience from the private servers (which after all, have been doing this for years).
---
Although this AV is 1.12.1, its not what a lot of people would associate with vanilla AV, and thats a reason to reconsider it and do it right before its released.
---
In my opinion, this is far far better than the content I usually see on this subreddit. Mainly just been checking lately to see what you've been posting.
---
I'd still love to see places like Gilneas or Quel'Thalas (both with Vanilla's original shape) be re-imagined.
---
Shiiii you right
---
Classic tanking was mainly warriors. Some druids. And rarely pally because no taunt.
---
Is that "Magic dust" the hunter used to put the Orc to sleep in the first fight?
---
Spirit = Recovery speed
---
Intellect = Longevity
---
Intellect is better to an extent by giving you enough Mana to cast the heal + heal + cat form after each fight. After you have enough to keep going indefinitely like this, Agi is better to end fights sooner
---
I mean if you're in the Deadmines for 20+ years without leaving in an era with only hand delivered letters it gives doubt to how much control he had. He had to rely on Lieutenants more than likely while he supervised the ship build which was more his speciality I'd say.
---
Hell, the People's Militia and the SW Military had no clue he or the stonemasons were involved at all. With all the Defias that were captured, if he was so hands on then his name would have slipped in those 20 years. 
---
It's ironic in a way they had the gold mines considering why they rioted. He turned down the money for payment from Varian for what reason? Pride? Or he was influenced as Bolvar was through sinister magic? If he cared about his people at all than it could only have been the second option. He even worked with the "hated" nobility, showing he had no true beef anymore with them, he only wanted to kill or capture the man who tried to pay him and whose wife he killed. 
---
That's Onyxia influence if I've ever seen it.
---
Bro, you posted cringe!
---
Blizzard: "have a nice weekend loser."
---
Correct me if I am wrong but I believe dwarfs can stoneform out of it? It can also be dispelled. 
---
Losing scatter shot really hurts and I believe wyvern sting has min range of 8y so you aren’t doing to get rid of melees who have already reached you. 
---
The long CD hurts too. I am sure it has uses in some situations but the draw backs are pretty significant too.
---
Raid leaders are so hard to come by. Good raid leaders are even more rare
---
Rogue for sure
---
Certainly not enhancement.
---
&gt; Why not award players every 30 minutes with an honor amount while in Old AV.
---
Probably because people would AFK in it.  There are a few of us that really did love those all day battles.  I think they just don't have an older version of AV.  I'm pretty sure they said as much on the old WoW forums.  I used to cry about missing AV there all the time.
---
I know, I was just trying to be funny but I guess it's all serious business on this thread, thanks for the votes down guys
---
What was this exactly?  Like why did it update at all if we aren't in the beta?
---
Musta missed Soda poppins 10min monologue about making a blacklist system to bully streamsnipers (or whoever he may label as such) into stopping by attempting to deny them intro into guilds on their faction (Yes, really.)
---
In whatever the expansion was before BfA you could still get games where they were summoned.  You just need to convince people at the start to go for it.
---
A countdown for you OP: www.iswowclassicout.com
---
They are not changing any of the items. They are only changing their availability. This is very different from importing previous patch content into 1.12 
---
You still haven’t shown what actual, material data is being imported from previous patches?
---
Even the progressive loot table changes are using the 1.12 versions of gear on both sides of the progression.
---
oh yeah he definitely seems like a reasonable calm person that wouldn't... Do i need to type /s to that? Bloody fanbois.
---
argh stop it
---
&gt;So I suggest being clear when talking about “custom” version of 1.12. You aren't actually talking about pre-1.12 versions of content.
---
If I remove my tire from my bike, am I not customizing it? Or If I add a flashlight to it?
---
Why is there a BFA grid in the game? Whats the report player function? etc etc.
---
Why would content be gated if it wasn't to customize the journey to make it more like the classic progression structure?
---
I plan to farm Winterspring a lot, so why not. Leather, thorium and firewater on a hunter is my plan.
---
You like that stick up the butt run in Human males?
---
That’s the problem Blizzard has though. 
---
The most fun version of it IS the honor impaired version. 
---
Once they added the honor bonus for winning quickly that was it. It incentivized quick games. 
---
And sure maybe there is a balance in there you could strike but if you’re halfway to the fun old version why not just take that all of the way. 
---
Yes the honor sucked. But really who cares. It’s not like there’s an achievement. Make it hard. It’s still a fun time. 
---
Old code or not I don’t feel like old AV would be particularly hard to replicate.
---
Added after 1.12 but in vanilla? You sure you got that right there, bud?
---
I rolled a nelf hunter and ran to elwynn to play with someone. At level 10 I had to run all the way back for the quest. I could get skills from the hunter trainer.
---
She doesn't feel pain, and her body is supercharged by necromantic magic, so yes, it is. Again, her short story literally says she could survive a fall from 200+ feet and be fine, and there's the comic of a bog-standard Forsaken shrugging off a spear through the gut like it's nothing. She unquestionably needs armor less than someone like Garrosh does, who still feels pain and has use for his vital organs.
---
When was this put in? How far into wow was 1.12?
---
Adding the original factory parts to a bike later on is not “cutomizing it.” Jesus, even your analogies fail, lol.
---
Seriously wtf lol
---
It might be optimal in full T3 gear with consumables but you are losing the team benefit from trueshot aura as well.
---
I started off like this, but every single year I get older I realize that I'm turning into my dad. I have like 15 tabs worth of hunting stuff open right now...
---
What was that insane burst damage??
---
So how is the BFA grid an original factory part to 1.12.1 then? If its its not a customization.
---
&gt;not: We got a city to purge
---
you blew it op
---
dude nice one
---
In other games they provided incentives for joining the lower pop faction inclufing:
---
increased honor/exp rep gain
---
more gold dropped
---
no flight cost
---
less repair cost
---
free respeccing
---
Ha GOT EM
---
Bro, I’ve liked them all so far.. but this has now become a straight addiction. Take a nap man. Refresh yourself.
---
I've had many undead over the years and not once have I made it into silverpine... I'm maining an undead mage for classic and I want to experience silverpine for the first time
---
Please accept me like this simple meme. Please
---
It makes perfect sense once you realize that the world does not revolve around you. This is not about you, and it is unfortunate, but not unexpected, that you are unable to provide any counter-arguments at all other than you personally totally really like a certain version of AV.
---
Until you can fill up a 80 man battleground on your own, across multiple realms, your own personal opinions or feelings are irrelevant. This is a discussion about what actually works in reality.
---
My boss can access and approve holiday requests from home so he put his on the moment a date came out, then denied mine when I put mine in first thing in the morning when I got in.
---
Luckily he has since changed his mind, might be because I told him in future I'll be ringing up at like 2am to book release dates off for things if that's when they're announced.
---
It means neither. We're not in beta.
---
You’re not riding the bike, you dolt. You can’t access BWL from launch, but it’s still the 1.12 version of BWL and when you do finally “ride it” it’ll be the 1.12 version.
---
[removed]
---
If it makes you feel any better I believed you for like 5 minutes. Then I remembered each of those things very slowly, 1 by 1.
---
I still remember the original AV that was being advertised as upcoming content, the map being twice as thicc in the middle to make room for the Gnolls and Defias fighting for the Scrying Orb that allows the team that takes it vision, farming the Ice Wolves / Rams to create the cavalry / infantry charge and it actually being a battle-tide-turning-effort.  
---
It felt good to actually do the side content in the Battleground and have it make a difference. **THIS is the Alterac Valley they should have implemented.**  
---
Now I have to tell my friends i'm definitely not coming back for this.
---
My life literally peaked in 2006
---
AV is for beta testers not Stress testers
---
&gt;You’re not riding the bike, you dolt. You can’t access BWL from launch
---
But if it was 1.12.1, wouldn't BWL be in the game and accessible, or am I remembering wrong?
---
&gt;but it’s still the 1.12 version of BWL and when you do finally “ride it” it’ll be the 1.12 version.
---
Yes it will, but the game has still been changed, right? Or hasn't it because I am pretty sure your 1.12.1 experience on launch won't be the same as in 2006, because they have added custom gates to the game, that wasn't there in 2006. Which means that Blizzard is already meddling with the game.
---
Nope, really enjoying these. Though I am surprised there wasn't a Hyjal or Gilneas zone, seeing as you did Uldum and Twilight Highlands. Gilneas I'd understand, as nothing really changes, but Hyjal would have a clear lack of fire compared to the Cataclysm iteration.
---
I'm not sure who it was, maybe it was Mark Kern, but one of the developers for sure. He said that bosses (and mobs?) had thematic armor values and resistances and could even have negative resistances.
---
It makes complete sense for Ragnaros to be sensitive to cold so I'd say it's very likely that this is how the developers designed him.
---
Its not all roses. Sometimes FD resists at the worst time... Also we need FD + cables for BRez. You should thank us!
---
Apparently they updated their catalog. So people with 1.13 game files on their PC had the drop down option appear again, but unable to hit play. Complete jebait :( If not that, then prep for next stress test, which would mean very poorly planned timing for releasing it so close to AV Beta weekend.
---
Theradras and Therazane.  
---
Serious PH material.
---
nice vid. You seem like you know what you're talking about. I've played for many years and never touched macros. Mouse-over macros seem almost game-breaking. I'm worried it will take away from the challenge of playing a priest. 
---
Also, a question - I'll be rolling a priest come classic, and I see many people are big supporters of leveling holy till 40+ because of efficiency and no downtime. What are your thoughts about this?
---
World pvp is fun at times, but sometimes with high levels ganking it’s sooo stupid and ruins the game for me personally. And it can be tough for you to do quests and ruin PvE. Soooo that’s why I’m choosing a PvE server. I love battlegrounds but like damn if I just wanna get drunk and go fishing for an hour I don’t wanna worry about people killing me.
---
Your experience at launch will never be the same unless you let me come over and kick your balls so far up into your body to replicate your balls not having dropped yet. 
---
What time can I head over?
---
I believe so.
---
lieb? lol
---
Fuck new players, I guess? I don't see what the problem is with people trying out classic.
---
It would be everything else that comes out with that phase.
---
The way you described old AV makes me not want the old AV
---
I think mine is A if its not its very close. I’ll check when I het home though.
---
Scales with the stupidity of your team.
---
It's alright if you raid manages is capable of staying out of stupid
---
Kargoz has a [bow progression](https://youtu.be/gKx3qqbdMfY?t=1221) section in his hunter video for ally &amp; Horde.
---
Back Dooring.  Please forgive me my most gracious man for pointing that out. I am forever in your debt :3
---
The log in message says the other beta servers are down until Monday (NA).
---
The fact you get blinding powder is gonna have a pretty big impact on the price of fadeleaf pretty sure.
---
I see this as a rare opportunity to relive my teenage years again. 
---
Who can actually go back and relive part of their childhood?
---
You know what WoW did for me? Kept me from going out and doing stupid shit or wasting money other than just 15 dollars a month.
---
In Org there’s the donation npc in the tailoring hut. I didn’t try to interact but she’s there.
---
I wish. I'm a very lonely person. I have really only 1 friend who I hang out with regularly. But I spend a lot of time at home because of my job. I'd love to go outside with people my own age specifically women because my friends have always been dudes and I need some variety. Unfortunately there's not many people my age in my town. Everyone is in high school or married. It's the place you go to settle down after you're married. People my age all are in college or moved to the big city to hang out, drink, party, get laid and all that other fun stuff I wish I were doing.
---
its been more depressing trying to find a game that was as much fun as vanilla was.
---
Is my spec correct or would you change anything?
---
So now your solution for testing AV is to release a PTR after Classic launch with Blackwing Lair also available. How are you this dense?
---
Hand of Rag is for Shamans kthnx. I got scrubs to blow up!
---
That extra hit makes a difference too. In vanilla you feel the talents, skill, and gear upgrades.
---
The title lost me.
---
My wife's boyfriend is driving me to my vasectomy operation and then taking me to buy a new pc for classic :)
---
So you want it custom to the way you want it
---
Ironically Arthas was right all along. Apparently the forsaken go to some kind of hell after they die. Arthas killing people before they turned into undead may have saved their souls.
---
Great write up! 
---
How long after launch do you think is ideal to wait before releasing completely new content?
---
&gt; It makes perfect sense once you realize that the world does not revolve around you. 
---
It literally does.  Go read up on relativity.  But since we're talking about my love for Old AV and not Physics, we'll drop this pointless inclusion by you.
---
&gt; that you are unable to provide any counter-arguments at all other than you personally totally really like a certain version of AV.
---
Counter arguments for what?  You aren't arguing anything other than my love of Old AV, and how you think I don't like what I know I like.  There is no context in the words you have typed where "Turns out that you think you do, but you don't." works.  Never.
---
I do want Old AV.  I don't mind sitting in a queue for an hour because it's full (Protip for kiddo: it did happen that way.  I did play it that way.  I did love the shit out of it.)
---
I am going to play 1.12 AV, and I don't give a fuck if you think I like Old AV or not.  Your statement on the desires of my heart are both wrong, and contribute nothing to the discussion.
---
I also don't give a shit if you feel threatened that my love of Old AV is somehow going to come to fruition in the form of them replacing your speedrun version and ruining your precious honor gains.  
---
In short, fuck off.
---
Or you can be grateful this is even happening instead of cherry picking every tiny little thing that isn't perfect for you
---
I think its still much more fun than this AV tho /retail AV.
---
I grinded it to exalted so I get pretty fed up with it after a while obviously, but I still had good times there, and I also liked that you actually had to play with your team since the mobs were so strong and would beat the shit out of you if you tried to run solo. You also had to deal with objectives, and if you couldn't zerg the boss you had to summon the bosses and use them for push.
---
I would much rather prefer old AV, and if they ever did a patch 1.13.1 rebalance it so the long-battles were more efficient in terms of honor, or that you could somehow obtain the badges by doing certain objectives in the BG (which would be very limited obv) so having those long ass battles would be more viable.
---
As it looks now on the 1.12.1 AV, it will be played exactly the same as on retail and will be a complete borefest imo, and it will so speed up how fast people can obtain the AV exalted epics by quite a big margin, which sucks as the game is already pretty messed up at the end-game anyways.
---
It's fun.  Imo it's the most interactive role that truly shows who the good players are.
---
bad bot
---
Excellent
---
truth x10 when we were kids the worst thing in the world was patch down times and getting gainked. now, it's all bla bla bla pay your mortgage, pay the doctors, pay the HoA, work over time for no pay or get fired.
---
It’s not a solution because it’s not a problem.
---
No, that's just dumb.  Don't tell me to like the turd you put on my plate because there also happens to be a steak there.
---
skinning/engi on launch, skin as much devilsaur as i can then swap to enchanting when it's too contested / diremaul comes out. if dmt solo is nerfed (i doubt it) i'll just do herb/mining +engi
---
Thanks. Never have listened to Nothing. Ill give it a go.
---
Here's the way I look at that- all those decisions made in Legion would have been okay if Legion was the end of WoW. Not that I don't think WoW deserves to continue on, but if Legion was the end, bringing back these heroes for one last hurrah and having them come back and reunite with their friends in victory is fine.
---
The problem is that following it with BFA... those characters feel really out of place. If you know you're doing BFA afterward, you really should have let those characters die. Turyalon waging a thousand year war against demons and helping defeat the demon master responsible for the destruction of innumerable worlds only to come back to Azeroth to fight Orcs... no. That's just silly.
---
Right.  That covers 4 ranks of 1 spell.  Or 4 total spells.  How many total ranks of heals do you have across all spells?  You might be able to get close but the specific level of nuance that can be applied with the old system isn't rivaled by the offered api.  I m not arguing it ideal but it's less flexible then having the computer do the math for you.
---
Good news!  Your subscription lets you play both.
---
Yep, pretty much. But I think the Nostalrius guys pulled it off pretty well that appealed to most people in the community, and it was still mostly based on 1.12.1, just with classic AV, 8 slot debuff cap and pre 1.12.1 itemization.
---
late-game balance is a complete wreck already since we are suppose to do MC with 1.12.1 stats, talents, itemization and debuff cap, and I would have prefered if Blizzard just did a little bit more.
---
Blizzard needs AV tested. What they're doing is the best solution to that problem. None of yours would work.
---
That’s why I’m thinking to just get BFA.. it’s only $25 right now.
---
Stay Madt.
---
I'd say at least 6 months
---
Naxx is a major patch, and we should let people experience the "base" game a long time and only release additional content when they really are in need of it.
---
Imagine the player you’re trying to kill uses a potion. They are back up to or near full hp again. Now you have a combo point already on them. Also, it won’t always be 1v1. You may be glad you only needed to put up 2-3 more cp’s instead of having to get that first one. That one combo point is time. It could be the difference between life and death.
---
Rogue’s are IMO the most fun to play, also as a plus you can stealth past ‘time sink’ mobs and walk directly to quest zones without having to fight your way through. Also cheap shot gives you a few seconds to burst which saves you health so you can farm without having to heal as often.
---
Prove it
---
by using follow, stay, and attack commands. pets are usable in most raid fights in vanilla
---
Thanks, this is exactly what I was looking for.
---
I was 19 and stationed in Okinawa, Japan in the Marines. My entire barracks was playing this game and it was like a raid/party every night for a little over a year. We all got deployed right when BC came out but it was an amazing run and I wouldn't trade those crazy nights for anything. We all raided with a bunch of crazy Australians on Uther and man what an amazing time of my life. I'd go back in heart beat and potentially trade my son for some T2 armor....... JK but seriously I'd trade my wife.
---
I'd say at least two years... It's a big decision to mess with what classic is meant to be.

Blizzard is forcing everyone in the Beta to test AV, there's your proof.
---
"work over time for no pay or get fired" There is something deeply wrong with this statement. If you are being FORCED to work OT and threatened with your job if yo don't (unless of course you are salary) that is suuuuper illegal and I am sure a lawyer would love to have a word about it.
---
Go imp SS. Then rush riposte.
---
Don’t stand in the fire, use first aid, consume pots and always show up with a flask
---
Still not a single counterargument whatsoever, just an out of the blue attempt to end up at /r/iamverysmart... Try to not lose control over something as trivial as a video game in the future, for your own sake.
---
Actually I would ahve the Classic+ servers be optionnal and keep standard Classic servers. 
---
But maybe it would split the community too much and blizzard doesn't want so many different versions, I don't know if this is doable
---
Alliance because the community is better
---
there are instant lvl 60pserver if you want to try around
---
I have to find my old piss bucket.
---
To that point, an old god that lives deep underground could have shadow and frost resistance as well
---
I don't need a "counterargument" when you haven't presented anything to counter.  I said I love Old AV, you said "Nu uh!"  That's not anything to counter.
---
A path to get out of Deathknell asap looks like this:
---
Pick up the quest outside the crypt.
---
Immediately start killing nearest bat while you kite towards the church.
---
Pickup the zombies quest.
---
Start killing zombies but make sure to kite the last one before ding back to the church.
---
Level 2, pick up The Damned.
---
Do The Damned, try to get the level 1 mobs if you're a spellcaster.
---
Deliver Damned and pickup Fipps quest, ignore the crate quest outside the church, take the spidercave one.
---
Immediately run over to Samuel Fipps if you're ahead of the pack.
---
Run to the spider cave, clear out the 10 neutral spiders first, then do the ones in the mine.
---
Deliberately kill yourself quickly inside the mine if able to and ress at the graveyard.
---
Bury Fipps, go deliver.
---
You should be level 4 now afaik, pick up new abilities.
---
Pick up scarlet bands quest, complete it.
---
Pick up Red Messenger, complete it.
---
Pick up any class quests. (priest for example)
---
Run out of Deathknell, take the innkeeper quest on your way out the door.
---
One thing that unfortunately has to be done with this path is you need to do the pumpkin quest *before* going to brill as you need the XP from it to hit level 6.
---
Get your xp bar just over halfway full if it isn't already, then kill yourself north of the road to deathwarp to Brill.
---
Completely ignore the Rattlecages quest and the equipment boxes quest as these are a horrible bottleneck with a lot of people there. You'll even be fighting against level 1 warlocks for it as they have to get 3 skulls for their Imp quest, so just don't bother. 
---
Completing the first zombie quest is optional, you can kill some while you're running between the other quests to reduce downtime, but you will be slower so beware of that.
---
Fuck you had internet there?  I got the shit end of that stick.
---
Make friends as you level. You will know who the hardcore are as they will be ahead of the pack. I’m also certain many guilds will be recruiting from the start. It shouldn’t be too hard to find the raiding guilds. Just ask to join and as the server will be new I’m sure they’ll let you right in.
---
Blizzard is forcing everyone to test AV is proof that it’s the only “solution to the problem?” I don’t even know what you’re arguing. What problem?
---
Real shame/sad that players downvote posts like this on the subreddit. The #nochange zombies are part of the reason WoW retail went off a cliff. I like your post UndeadMurky, but you gotta remember that the main reason players do dungeons/raids is for gear. If the gear rewards aren't worthwhile then players don't bother. 
---
Naxxramus gear should remain top end. Adding new raids that increase the tier level beyond 3 creates problematic power creep. The solution is perhaps to add set bonuses to gear from new raids, as well as bonuses that aren't just attribute differences. You have to create itemization that makes doing all the raid contet worth it, but at the same time doesn't invalidate the other raids. The issue of gear inflation is also something to consider. If you have 10-15 raids to choose from, then it could make it much easier to just stock up on epics. If the itemization is good enough that real character customization exists from collecting different raid tiers, then it could be ok.
---
Nice werk
---
Lol, yup. Classic is 10x harder than BFA pvp.
---
You lost me at “cata was the best expansion”.
---
That’s what I just tried.... and there is just a lot of inconvenient elements to it.. and I know thats a majority of why people are going back.
---
I think the biggest thing im looking for is the leveling progression with the community... when I hit 60, I really cannot play PVE. (No time)... so it’s just PVP grinding and I know that when it comes to PVP it’s pretty basic.
---
Watch Skarm on YouTube. He also did a stream with Tipsout that is a deep dive in warrior tanking. He speed runs Nax and did the entire raid in like an hour and ten minutes with Salad Baker's on a private server. He is the most experienced vanilla tank making content right now.
---
Vanilla Raiding is rather straightforward - the End Game content had very few mechanics that players needed to take into account when doing a boss fight. The most common mechanic was having to alter your position, aka the "don't stand in the X".
---
However - if stress is not your forte - I recommend playing a Restoration Druid instead: 
---
* Best single-target heal in the game
---
* Best heal-over-time combo in the game
---
* Combat Resurrection for when things go wrong
---
* Innervate for when every other healer runs out of mana
---
Maybe that’s what I was experiencing.... I had no clue what was good gear or not and the rotation is daunting because there are so many spells..... I guess it’s a matter of just learning it... super sad they don’t have arena :/
---
Managing consumables is a big part of healing too.
---
holy shit I completely forgot about this site! what a nostalgia rush lol. 
---
really useful info as well
---
Live on rice and beans....and beans and rice for the next 2 months.  Then buy a cheap machine that can run it.
---
but this is the crappy 1.12 AV.  people will get bored of it after 2 matches (i know i did) and it'll be a queue graveyard all weekend
---
a stress test is scheduled for June 19th and 20th
---
Sick? Bro I want more of this, it creates so many ideas and intrigue.
---
Raid healing is like driving a car. You always have to be paying attention, which can be boring. And you have to be on the lookout for maniacs doing dumb things.
---
It can also be more stressful if you're shorthanded on healers, or if your tank is made of paper.
---
This was like, some of the best times of my childhood
---
No, it means you have the classic currently installed. It’s so you can uninstall it easily.
---
Keep 'em coming!
---
tl;dr Summaries of stories do not provide an adequate justice of a stories' depth in storytelling, narrative, and overall nuance and therefore should not be made because it deglorifies someones' writing
---
Those guys are awesome, their ganks would never happen in retail, hopefully all streamers get into one server and the oogas keep doing what they've been doing
---
I said most people don't love old AV, few enough that they had to change it to get the queues to even pop on most servers. They had to change it. Your own personal opinion does not matter, and I explained that very clearly. 
---
What a strange thing to do, getting into an argument with someone without even reading what they write.
---
Night elves - emerald dreamcatcher unless you are the lucky first one there. Probably relics of wakening as well.
---
Absolutely not tired of these, I’m loving them. I’d like to possibly see a full Kalimdor/EK map with your zones added so you can see comparisons.
---
And if possible, a Gilneas and Ghostlands/Eversong to fit their vanilla shapes.
---
Also consider you were probably outgeared by most people on an instant 60 pserver
---
YEAH GIVE BETA TO GIRLS WHO JUST GIVE UP
---
Big true
---
SM/RUIN is the spec you would go if you get a debuff slot for corruption. Nightfall procs give a slight dps increase over demosac/ruin.
---
The problem of needing to test AV. For fuck's sake.
---
\*Creates Post\*  
---
WhErE tHe FuCk DiD I sAy ThAt?
---
What a bunch of bullshit. Anything can be summarized while being true to it's core message.
---
Negative resistances was something they removed *very* early on, something like 1.5 or 1.6.
---
Should of put a pic of that big mouth busty mama on there all dressed up In a pin up pose.
---
She's not going to bang you for trying to defend her you loser.
---
I wasn't arguing that "most people don't love old AV".  Ever.
---
I wasn't arguing why they changed it.  Ever.
---
Dumb fuck.
---
These are the same people that made BFA...
---
I don't understand why people think Old AV would fix these issues. It wouldn't. You could literally zerg old av just as much as you could zerg the new one.
---
This sub needs to do this, lets say it all together now, "WE WERE TRASH PLAYERS AND NOTHING ABOUT THE GAME WAS AS HARD AS WE REMEMBER".
---
Those words would literally sum up 3/4 of the complaints of this sub. Old AV was a boring piece of crap and only lasted long because we were shit at the game.
---
You could zerg old av just as much as you can zerg newer versions, people just didn't because...once again, we were trash. I for one do not want to go back to old av. While fun in its time, it is garbage and there was a reason it was changed.
---
(Not directing this at you).
---
Yea... I was getting nuked... I felt so slow and bad....
---
this is AWESOME
---
i bet her premium snap is lit
---
What’s wrong with doing dungeons with the same people?
---
Look it is sunny.
---
Healing raid is less stresful than 5 mans.
---
Source?
---
THEY CALLLLLLLLLL THE RIIIIISING SON
---
If he is nervous about healing I wouldn’t wanna burden him with having to battle Rez the main tank.  Priest or shaman/paladin would be my suggestion.  
---
Raid healing in 25 or 40 person raids is not stressful in my opinion because you are rarely THAT important - you are one of la y doing a job.
---
There was a change in patch 1.9 to Curse of Elements.
---
* Curse of Shadow and Curse of the Elements - These curses can no longer cause resistance to become negative. To compensate, both curses now increases the damage taken from the appropriate schools by a percentage.
---
After this patch the curses gave 10% more damage to Frost and Fire spells instead. If Ragnaros had say 0 Frost Resist before the patch, the giving him -75 Frost resist, assuming it works the same was as regular resistances should in theory give spells a chance to do 25%, 50%, 75% etc additional damage. I suspect the average damage increase from this would still be about 10%, same as the post 1.9 curse provides.
---
Now add enchants to the character planning tool
---
You shouldn’t run out of money for spells.
---
LMAO
---
https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
Start ganking streamers with 6 rogues instead.
---
3 rogues.
---
So what was the point of your reply, exactly?
---
It's definitely not that.  The mage in the video is consistently hitting him for \~1550 every time.
---
I 100 % agree for dual spec, but that opinion in this sub is suicide. It makes no sense to me that if you want to play a certain spec (say feral druid) you have to go raid as resto and pray no one rolls on feral gear so that you may have a chance to gear up your feral spec and play the game how you want to play it. And even then being taken into a raid is the guild doing you a 'courtesy'
---
It's been the cap for many a pirate
---
thank you sir!
---
Have you heard of youtube?  It's pretty cool.  You can search for stuff like ["world of warcraft airport"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=world+of+warcraft+airport) and get videos as a result.
---
You are so wise.
---
My title is bad, I guess I'll have to write it up again in a way that doesn't offend the 'no changes" guys
---
Regarding power creep, the first raid with gear better than Naxx is Dragon Isles, that comes out like 4 patches later and only 2 raids after that have better gear, the power creep would be fairly minimal.
---
I tried to make most of the new raids not invalidate the older and all the 20 men raid don't go beyond Naxx 
---
Anyway people who are against "power creep" because it invalidates older content are pretty much against any new content unless it is completely irrelevent
---
Which is why you should just have standard classic and classic+ servers
---
The nostalgia is real!
---
Live to win
---
If only there was some sort of counter, or meter, that quantified how well a DPS player was doing.
---
Pfft. For the Alliance!
---
Awesome read.  I remember a guild from my server "hijacked" the Grand Marshall title for one warrior for over a month.  I thought it was hilarious as just a climbing rank 7 or 8 but there was a lot of chatter from other PvPer and most of it was not nice...lol.
---
Like a comfy old pair shoes you forgot you owned
---
Id show up wearing this to meet him if i ever got the chance.
---
A meter that tells you dick all.  Who has the most consumables.
---
Who have they skilled so far? Soda i hope?
---
Ok, I looked at both the videos. The private server video is taken in the BWL patch.
---
I checked out the other video, and the Ragnaros speedkill got posted in August 2006. Ahn'Qiraj released in January 2006. In AQ20 the bosses have a chance to drop books that teach you higher levels to some of your abilities. Mages happen to get a new rank of Frostbolt.
---
Hello
---
1. No, if you are going a hemo build cold blood is sooo important for pvp, 100% take it over hit and imp sprint
---
2. Not sure sorry I should have mentioned I'm 90% a pvp player I don't know the hardcore details about raiding
---
3. Imp sap is pretty damn important for pvp for controlling targets, you can get away with skipping it if need be
---
4. I honestly wouldn't recommend maces for pvp unless you are very experienced. They can and will fuck up your dr's
---
Other notes about the build - Opportunity is a wasted talent, skip ghostly strike, pick up dirty deeds for pvp, get cold blood
---
Good luck my friend
---
Try reading it and you'll find out.  It was simply my opinion on what they should have done with.  It's not complicated, and it's only a couple of sentence.  Three, if you must know.
---
No, there really isn't.  Because every spec is viable in the way you want as the game sits.  You just need an understanding raid lead/raid.  But because of how memespecs work the vast majority of try-hards need something to be better than "can limp along and complete content with extra effort from 39 other people" (viable) and "can perform as well as other memespecs".
---
There was a time when 'negative resistances' was a mechanic. Meaning, you could lower a bosses resistances below 0 for added damage.   
---
It's possible that in the first video, Ragnaros only has 8 debuff slots. That would suggest this video was taken when boss resistances were different than during 1.12. But it's impossible to draw conclusions about videos from unknown patch dates, wearing unknown gear.
---
and you should not be able to see when your target is tracking herbs/ore
---
I kind of agree. It would be nicer for you, but for the rest of the population (even the casuals) are going to hit level 60 in the first yearish, and they would probably want the newer stuff to come out since they would be ready for it.
---
You couldn't push bosses to have negative resistances through abilities but they could have negative resistances innately.
---
Oh my god whoever did this was doing a public service imo.
---
Plus purge is really good vs mages.
---
XP/HR in Westfall is garbo. If you enjoy the zone then go for it, just be aware that it sucks.
---
If you're at naxx why do you need to mat farm to clear MC though
---
There’s too many of these submissions for me to take this content seriously.
---
Oh yeah. That’s not a problem. Most architects don’t even test code until it’s already in production anyway. 
---
They should release phase 1 and phase 2 beta a little later.
---
I've been noticing this for a while now. I thought it was just in my head.
---
[Coming Home](https://imgur.com/a/IFRM7V2)
---
sure, but its like why though, it diminishes it so much its not really worth reading
---
How it should be
---
I agree. You cant unlearn meta. It can change and patches can help push it along. But as soon as we figure out a better way to do somthing that's the new meta. Sure we could all agree to just fight in the field of strife for hours if all we wanted was to battle. But since we are there for honor and you dont get enough honor from kills we're not gonna do that.
---
this is part of the "strafing" bug (which is really a *facing* bug, related to head-tracking as part of the legion engine). it also affects casting spells to the side at targets.
---
So is it the speed of leveling that has made the world of BFA feel so small?
---
Absolutely. If it makes sense it's definitely possible.
---
A boss wearing cloth would have less armor than one wearing plate. A fire elemental should obviously have very high fire resistance and very low frost resistance.
---
I'm 90% sure that editor will be playing classic WoW at launch.
---
Ah, the ol' "I'm not stupid, I was just trolling" gambit.
---
[Joana's guide](https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm) is an absolutely phenomenal leveling guide. Alliance only has 1-40 right now for the beta, but by launch 40-60 will also be up.
---
The ragnaros mage also has like +300 spell power from consumeables that the Cthun mage doesnt and likely a high roll of +% damage darkmoon faire buff
---
My man!
---
Winter is coming.
---
&gt; Conclusion: Ragnaros is vulnerable to frost. Did private servers miss this? 
---
TLDR from a previous convo in this thread:  
---
The Mage in the speedkill has a higher rank of Frostbolt.
---
that's on the bug sheet, but i'm glad more people are talking about this.
---
super annoying
---
Same man. I legit just saw what it was supposed to be with this picture. I thought the background was the foreground
---
Holy shit I forgot about Divine Spirit.
---
I always remember it being snowy as fuck with very low visibility.
---
I'm not sure I ever even caught that!
---
I’m not trolling. I’m an serious
---
Not sure, I dont watch soda. I generally only watch warlock or druid streamers but all the big streamers play warrior/rogue/mage with very few exceptions. 
---
StaysafeTV plays warlock so I watch him, and i saw the oogas gank him a couple times, so i YouTube searched them and found a compilation video of them. It is pretty great watching them gank asmongold, that I gotta hand it to Esfand. Esfand actually saved asmongold and 3 others in his party from an ooga gank. Had esfand not been their ooga wouldve wiped them.
---
You couldn't? I happen to know you could put negative resistances on players with your abilities, why not bosses?
---
LOL! Does your boss play as well? My coworker actually doesn't, it was just an unfortunate coincidence he took the days off he did :(
---
I disagree with your pre supposition. I think there are a lot of reasons that players want classic, including things like having choices in your build, the feeling of accomplishment when you achieve something, community support among your guild and server, etc.
---
Dunno why so many people keep assuming that everyone else cares about their XP/HR. I feel like the majority will be casual players just trying to have fun.
---
Thank you! Looks like they're just jumping the gun a little.
---
&gt; there were some pretty famous jagoffs on other servers THAT KEPT UP THE PACE after hitting R14, for weeks and months... thus preventing all others from hitting 14 and enraging the server like nothing you've ever seen.
---
had to laugh at this part lol absolute legends
---
I'm not sure that's enough to explain the difference.  Rank 11 Frostbolt does 70 more damage than Rank 10 Frostbolt.
---
Whatever it takes
---
autism is defending streamers. [When just today a League streamer made it to the front page because he got triggered over someone using a character and he got that dude banned for 14 days because he got the stream to report over and over. streamers can ruin the game for people. get off streamers nutz.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIy8JUxaW7I)
---
I think the power creep in Classic WoW was at a breaking point. with Naxxramus. I think you can add new tier 1/tier 2 raids that players will want to do, as long as you offer unique trinkts/mounts and set bonuses from gear. Creating new ways to customize your character and playstyle could be possible through new gear itemization/bonuses. It shouldn't just be linear stat increases or decreases. Some of the concepts seem appropriate for Classic WoW.
---
Male purely because the female dwarf laugh is horrid.
---
There's too many unknowns here really. We dont know the total spellpower of each mage. They could all be gearing very differently. I imagine the private server mage has more +hit on his gear f.ex because that would overall result in more DPS. Meanwhile the prevailing thought back them among many players was to stack crit and spellpower for the highest possible crits.
---
Current streams have AV lasting 2 and a half hours so far that isn't into Horde Keep yet, and another is over an hour and a half into AV. It's fine.
---
Proper neck support is critical
---
&gt;A lot of streamers got bored of it within just a few hours.
---
It's level 58 with actually shit quality gear. I'm talking gear that is worse than we would have normally at 58 just from questing and doing some light dungeons. Of course people are going to be bored.
---
Level 60 PvP and level 58 PvP are vastly different beasts.
---
We all know what went down on his discord before he purged it.
---
I agree with you there, but I also think a lot of the hype is about the PvP.  I think players might tire of BG grinding after Phase 3. This is why I am so curious about how Phase 2 plays out.
---
&gt; Adding new raids that increase the tier level beyond 3 creates problematic power creep. 
---
Naxxramas IS the "problematic power creep". BC saved the game was being drown by the necessity of welfare epics (hell, TBC pre-patch handed out honor epic like candy just to keep the peace because Naxx gear was fucking everything up). Naxx "worked" in the sense that it didn't last long enough as current content to destroy the game. If we had a content drought at the end of vanilla, I'm pretty confident in saying the game would have started to see stagnation in subs that early on. 
---
Any version of "1.13" that doesn't include a raised level cap to 70 to flush the mess that is left behind by Vanilla down the toilet to start fresh is a mistake. Why even bother posting it?
---
If you want to do anything, give me level 70 Emerald Dream expansion. Not that it will happen, but it makes way more sense than this nonsense.
---
Jokes on them, this excruciating period waiting for release is the most depressing era
---
This should be the new licence plate phrase for Florida
---
&gt; 1.12 Alterac Valley doesn't seem as fun as some players remember. A lot of streamers got bored of it within just a few hours. Can you really blame them? The 1.12 Alterac Valley is 15 years old and not much different than the version on Retail. So what is the appeal there?
---
It's exactly as fun as people remember that version to be.  The issue is that most people when they think of "Vanilla AV" fondly are remembering the versions that were not nerfed nearly that much.  
---
&gt; The sad reality of Classic is that World PvP is sort of pointless.
---
Fun.  Fun was the point.  You are either a PVPer who PVPs for the sake of fun, or you are a PVPer who PVPs for the sake of loot.  Can you PVP for loot and have fun doing it?  Sure, I guess.  But you'll never have quite as much fun as the guy who PVPs for the sake of the fight.
---
&gt;  I am just not buying into all the premade WSG hype etc.
---
That's a think for tryhards.  Some people love organized small scale PVP.  I am not one of them.  The bigger the battle, the better.  Throw in some chaos.  The scale of AV is what helped make it so great for me.  I love big battles and I cannot lie.  
---
Maybe if they had a version of Warsong and AB that were 40v40 I'd like them ore.  I mean I'll play them from time to time, but they don't float my PVP boat.
---
Private server mages also tend to favor more bonus hit on their gear over raw spelldamage compared to mages back in Vanilla where spellpower and crit was considered by many to be the best stats.
---
Without knowing the spellpower of all the mages in the videos theres just too many unknowns imo.
---
I wished I already knew about wow back then lol. Guess they will fix stuff like this in classic
---
Can't keep their DoTs up and cannot use their pets (die to AoE/don't scale).   
---
Warlocks were pretty broken in vanilla. Just took everyone a while to notice.
---
In that case, then don't worry about it.
---
Meters tell you a lot. If you are a rogue or mage and top of the dps chart but also top of the healing received chart then you aren’t doing your job correctly.
---
it's not that people are celebrating ganking and corpse camping. they're celebrating the novelty of three identical troll rogues named after variants of ooga going around and killing people. it's amusing and a unique little thing. things like that make vanilla special. if they play on classic, you can say ''yeah i played on the ooga server'' like you played on angwe's server or whatever. i can see how it could annoy someone but as i am not in a mad rush to get to max level and feel like the world before that is worth investing time in, if i got ganked by them i would probably just be mildly amused and happy that i got to see the oogas in person. 
---
also: 1) corpse camping did not occur in this clip. she exits the game right as she dies and goes to play something else. did you even watch the whole thing?
---
2) imagine hurling personal insults at people who chuckled at a short video game gank clip and then telling them to grow up
---
Mm but you can’t go to a subreddit that’s frequented by people with a largely different value system to yours and expect them to shift their behaviour based on your own value system.
---
Monument valley?
---
Great read, d0nt-worry-be-happy, great nostalgia.  I got a couple anecdotes you might like.
---
On medium-pop Aegwynn I was part of such a guild, we produced at at least 90% of the server's ~20 High Warlords.  The only other ones were Shamans, pre-BG, that spent all their days sitting out front of Ironforge windfury'ing everything.  There was even a dude who made HWL twice!  Made it pre-BG and again after the new PVP gear update came out.
---
I joined "The" PVP guild when the first generation of HWLs were leaving the ranks-  mostly for PVE and some quitting WoW.  We had some shitty Shaman next in line for rank and he set the honor cap at 600,000... we called him lazy and were annoyed because non-guilies could actually compete.  He made it of course because we respected the cap. Most our "HWL-Selectees" set cap at about 750k.  As TBC closed in our last HWL made it at 1.2 million.  Later on, I was so amazed when my cousin, who played on high-pop Destromath, said honor-cap started at 1.1 million MINIMUM.  Holy shit!
---
 I know at least 4 HWLs that logged in Tuesday (or was Wed morning?) for promotion, logged off, and were never seen again.  Such an unhealthy system... so much burn-out. I wish Blizz got rid of rank decay or some other small tweak.  I remember the devs said they regret the old system.
---
Last story.  I got robbed of HWL on the second to last promotion day of Vanilla!  Finished out at rank 13 &amp; 1/3!  As TBC approached people were getting all fired up for ranking before the system went away.  So there were these three guys(!) who were playing one low-ranked toon to get #1 rated contributor.  Besides being illegal to ToS, we calculated and told him/them that even at #1 they could only make 4 ranks while screwing me out HWL.  Well they didn't care.  I couldn't compete and came in 3rd contributor and he/them making 2nd.  It halted my projected path to HWL before the old system closed while they made rank 8.  (Number #1 of course made HWL- I can't believe my guildie out-grinded three people!) But for me what a bummer!
---
&gt; The reason other "casters" don't do it is because they have spammable spells they can cast
---
No, it is because spell cast completion resets the swing timer, meaning you can't auto, cast a non-instant, fast spell, and auto again.
---
Sure, there's lots of good information, but winning the dmg meter isn't impressive at all.
---
I did this in Wrath on a Rogue at 67 or 68, i think back then that was the level to eliminate (or almost eliminate) resists, I farmed lockboxes for Ravenholdt rep for my Druid. It was very enjoyable, if you have a slowfall you can do a great jump near the end and just go again.
---
Im jealous for your sake, its the most "meshuggah" sounding meshuggah album if that makes any sense... enjoy!
---
Great work &lt;3 Looking forward to more results!
---
True, but usually hit would be traded over crit not spellpower right?
---
Anecdotal, but I distinctly remember hitting Ragnaros with frostbolt at level 70 in Burning Crusade and having him take extra damage from it.
---
According to some of the p server theory crafters, Nightfall procs and corruption is a net dps loss when you compare it to just spamming Shadow Bolt. The issue is because you still have a global cooldown even though its an instant cast Shadow bolt. Don't ask me how they came up with the results, I just know the outcome.  
---
And when you straight up compare the two specs, DS/Ruin blows SM/Ruin our of the water any day of the week. 15% is and will be always greater than 10% and a few instant Shadow Bolts. The only way SM/Ruin wins is on trash mobs and on boss fights where there are multiple targets. For raw dps, DS/Ruin is objectively better dps.
---
It was likely hyperbole for "Get paid too little, it's heavily implied that you need to work OT or you'll be passed over for raises and possibly fired for something asenine later."

The empty unfinished zone next to searing gorge? Thought you meant burning steppes at first.
---
Blizzard, hire this guy.
---
I saw *both* bosses get summoned in MoP once.
---
This is the only reason I would roll PvP. Also, I'll be able to level pretty high before there are too many 60s. I'll probably still be a bit behind, but the majority of wPvP will be at level. Leveling alts will be the hard part.
---
not at all, what lies have streamers told you?
---
That’s such a good point, I need to remember effects that stay the same when downranked!
---
I'm not who we're talking too but that sounds perfect. Will this guild be on a pvp server?
---
Didn't read but upvoted anyway just for the effort .
---
No need, you served your purpose. See you around!
---
Ah... my new background.
---
Everyone and their mother tames Echayakee. Not a unique pet at all
---
He is picking troll!
---
There is hype around the whole package. But having said that I see a LOT more hype around raiding and leveling than I do about anything with PVP
---
Spell there means magical debuff not poison nor physical (such as hamstring).
---
So because you had a fond experience of something else, and don't understand others experiences, that is reason enough to rob them of theirs?
---
Nah, [THIS](https://koa.com/blog/images/Explore-Devils-Tower-in-This-Road-Trip.jpg?preset=blogPhoto) is Mulgore IRL.
---
I would bang your mom. lol
---
I guess I’ll roll something else then...
---
If you have a competent tank, other healers that pull their weight, and dps that have a functioning IQ, it's not that much harder than dungeons and mana management is your biggest concern. But it gets exponentially harder for each of those missing elements
---
The Defias control about 70% of Stormwinds 2 most important zones, and are wealthy enough to employ Pirates, Goblins, Gnolles and Kobolds. All because they rioted and took what they wanted. They didnt have gold mines or anything prior to being snubbed payment so i dont see whats ironic about that.
---
You seem to be inferring that the Defias just kinda fell into everything they had and i just dont think so, nor is that even what the video is rly about. Think were gonna have to just agree to disagree man.
---
AV is going to be a zergfest no matter which version you make it.  I've played the original version on private servers and the games are over fast because people rush to the end anyway.  It just takes a bit longer.
---
You have to understand that everyone knows everything about the game now so it is all optimized.
---
The people wanting honor (wont be in AV to begin with) but want a fast win / loss in order to maximize it.
---
The people who want reputation want a fast win/loss in order to maximize it.
---
So everyone is going to rush to the end.  No one gains anything by sitting at the bridge and fighting for 6 hours.
---
Nah I did the childhood WoW, now I work at Blizzard and it's pretty nice. Can't blame the games 😂
---
did my daily check to see if i got into beta and went through the same exact thing lol.
---
Guild name! I'd join this guild.
---
Just saw that too and had a moment of hope.
---
Shadowguard is legit, it's so underrated at least in 1v1s
---
Right I took spells too loosely and didnt think of the difference between a spell say a shot like a hunter has. I guess I imagine all charters abilities as spells unless they are physical like a warrior or rogues
---
Streamers? On private servers? What?
---
We had a similar experience with Leotheras in SSC except everyone died when he enraged. A SW Pain from a healer ticked his last bit of HP before he reset. That was our guild first kill too.
---
&gt;Anecdotal, but I distinctly remember hitting Ragnaros with frostbolt at level 70 in Burning Crusade and having him take extra damage from it.
---
Sure, I mean who really knows right? I just see there's other explanations that make sense too. I might be wrong. We will find out in a few months.
---
You should make private server and make modifications as much as you want. Stop with these retarded ideas which are not classic
---
It doesn't. This can be summarized. Anything can. Noone has fucking 20 minutes to read a long wall of text from a stranger on reddit.
---
Owls are not the best leveling pets. They only pass cats when you’re fighting two mobs simultaneously, which is the minority of your leveling
---
Used those bad boys successfully a few times on my hunter. For a few moments, the Huntar is the hero.
---
The fact that it procs on spell casts as well as physical hits is crazy. And it's only like 250 mana for like 400 dmg. Has a chance to proc blackout and adds shadow weaving. Seems way more valuable in consistent battle compared to the undead's devouring plague. Devouring plague is cool but I know the way I play and I would never think a situation is worthy of that 3 min CD. I would always say "no you dont need, you might need it next fight" and then never use it lol
---
You are fucking stupid did you know that? 😄
---
Just because I dont have some inferiority complex that causes me to cry about streamers 24/7 doesnt mean I'm defending them lol. You're pretty pathetic if you let streamers bother you that much.
---
on private servers after the av nerf all it became was zerg rushing the base. If you want that you are more than welcome to play bfa.
---
According to this website, Mark of Tyranny and Smoking Heart of the mountain are better. 180ac &amp; 150ac
---
"Florida Man refreshes r/classicwow more than 80000 times per day"
---
god that sounds awful, no changes plz
---
&gt;No, it is because spell cast completion resets the swing timer, meaning you can't auto, cast a non-instant, fast spell, and auto again.
---
Yeah, that's *why* caster spells reset the swing timer and hunter casts like aim shot don't.  Blizz made it that way to prevent what you are saying.
---
Enlighten me pls. I need drama.
---
but at the same time female dwarf is rare
---
Of course he’s a hunter.
---
Don't forget that raiding guilds used instance runs as a method of weeding out incompetents. We'd use to gear up people and then bring them into the raid group as others quit or stopped playing or were poached away.
---
When LFD came out, that process died overnight. There was no way to ensure that a player in LFD was on the same server and able to join the raid group.
---
The realm-first guild I was in (I believe we finished 25m heroic hard mode in Ulduar neck and neck with another guild) folded within a month of LFD. There weren't new recruits or skilled replacements anymore.
---
Blue gear excludes offsets, rings etc. You will eventually hit a wall the more geared people get.
---
There are male night elves?
---
I love people who think alphas and betas are just free invites to playing the game early.  Maybe Steam early access and the like are to blame.
---
I remember getting beta keys for Star Wars: The Old Republic, and everything you did triggered a report screen.  Did this quest work as intended, were there enough enemies for the quest, how intuitive or confusing was the quest text.  You were given access to the game early, and in return you needed to provide them with constructive feedback.
---
Idk, maybe the alphas and betas I remember are things of the past and are only used now as gateways for streamers and developers as a shameless cash-grab and free promotion.
---
And before the nerf, queues didn't pop after the first couple months. You'd be lucky to get into an AV per week on a 8k+ population server.
---
If you don't want to play AV at all, you're welcome to just not queue for it.
---
Just get a baby carrier, and you’re set!
---
They thought I didn't
---
But I do
---
does everybody have this? Are they planning on adding more people to the beta soon? Or is this just Blizzards latest attempt at blue balling me
---
The Vanilla-style walljumping is not coming back in Classic, unfortunately.  I'm really bummed but I kind of understand why they can't bring it back.
---
I just finished a 3 hour game on the beta.  We summoned the tree and it was probably the only reason we won.
---
Drek was 2 shotting all of the "tanking" warriors.  
---
We ended up having about 8 warriors rotate tanking with shieldwall up and still barely killed him.
---
thanks
---
Not sick at all! These are some of the only posts I enjoy not complaining about streamers, layering, or whatever else.
---
I dunno, sounds like they got to you either way
---
This is an old thread! But still a hot topic. The short answer to your question is "yes". 
---
Long waits for BGs are not worth increased familiarity.
---
dw, he has Wisdom :     \^)
---
We should buy a hotel and all move in. Mini fridge and good WiFi is all we need to live. Who’s in?
---
I guess it could be, but if you're on reddit then that means you have spare time so i dont see the biggie
---
True true...
---
The itemization is  definitely questionable. You only get one set of gear and if that gear is for a spec you're not familiar or fond with, oh well.
---
The Druid gear seems the worst offender. Whoever put that set together needs to sit down and actually play a Druid for the first time in their life.
---
How so? Haven’t played retail recently
---
Underwater deeprun tram instance where you are trying to save it from the pirates flooding it?
---
no it wasnt.
---
clustering them together was.
---
I was dead set on NE male for classic but after playing a pserver I really hate their Gun/xbow animation and the sideways bow is just "meh"
---
I'm thinking of going dwarf instead because I like all of their animations.
---
the goal is already lost. layers are making sure of that
---
Doesn't look like anything to me.
---
Sometimes I think this would the the right choice. Then I realize I don’t own a home,
---
My wife would murder me, my parents wouldn’t take me and classic is going to be, well, amazing so let’s do this.
---
Having a bit higher ilvl doesn't always mean it's better in Vanilla WoW, just look at all the dungeons items that are BiS until Naxx or aq 40
---
I think you can have a raid with gear slightly better, not everythnig will be better and remplace the Naxx gear the way items are stated in Vanilla with unique effects etc...
---
Mom!!! Hotpockets!!!
---
Looks really neat!
---
If you're a retail WoW player, then I could see why you wouldn't care about 1.12 PVP. 
---
But if you're a retail WoW player, you're probably not the target audience for 1.12.
---
Everyone who has the stress test client installed on their computer had this. It’s only so you can uninstall the client easily.
---
It wouldnt Tell US If its in the Game at Launch though.. :3
---
As a Canadian, Florida sounds like a strange exotic place.
---
Like USA’s pierced, hairy, nipple.
---
Chikan is what Japanese call the guys who molest girls on trains. Whole train cars are women only because it happens so often. Particularly on the trains where everyone is packed in so tight you can lift your feet off the ground.
---
Palla gear is all strength, have fun healing lmao
---
So no comment about the actual content ? 
---
People are only here to debate on "no changes" which is sad, this post was mostly about fan made stories in the world of azeroth.
---
This a good analogy.
---
I like Healing because of the triage calculations you have to do. Ranking from "oh shit how did we end up here" to "the druid can get that one".
---
If you've healed a 5-man dungeon, or any group quest even, you're familiar with the triage. Its basically that but instead of 5 people you have 40 people. Its not much different. The hard part is coordinating the heals efficiently as to not waste mana.
---
I really wish we got the AV with all of the extra NPCs. That was my favorite edition.
---
Dwarves are great, but the ally also have humans (boring) night elves (creepers) and gnomes. Fuckin gnomes, man
---
They all do it with each other...same with "okkaaaaaaaaay....okaaaaay guys"
---
Confirmation
---
See that’s even funnier when you realize First Aid is also the name of the most important textbook for medical school
---
Come on now, everyone knows wow doesn’t allow numbers!
---
why?  for fun.
---
Rofl
---
I was in a high end raiding guild in vanilla. I was in my late teens. A few people were younger then me but most were early 20s to early 30s. 
---
Raiding with them made me mature quite a bit, then becoming an officer and making decisions and speaking on ventrillo to an audience of 39 people, my mostly older peers, having them listen contently to my instructions. Greatly improved my public speaking abilities and confidence. 
---
Learning patience and how to coach people and provide constructive criticism. How to listen and be fair. How to approach a difficult problem as a team and use our strengths and weaknesses to find success. All these skills I learned playing WoW. 
---
My guild leaders at the time, Kelvin and Sean were one of the reasons I even ended up going to college. They got me excited about getting an education and helped me in the application process.  
---
Classic for me was an awesome time and I learned so much.
---
It has been a while, but I ran the guild "The Angry Carebears" I believe it was on Laughing Skull. We were an alliance guild on a server heavily dominated by horde. 
---
I would add two comments about the grind to 14. As mentioned in the post, my guild controlled who was rank 14 for alliance.
---
1. Getting the Unstoppable Force. Realizing we (warriors) needed a primary weapon until 14, the Unstoppable Force was the choice. 
---
I remember organizing the top 40 people that I PVP with. The task was for those 40 people to play AV for one week. Collect as much head/ears from other players. After we collect for a week, we would all join AV through "ventrillo" Click Now! If enough of our 40 did not get in, we would hold off a game to turn in. 
---
It was a big enough event, everyone was trying to get in the "turn in" game. When we got our numbers, everyone hit exualted in AV with how many 1,000s and 1,000s of trophys we turned in. I remember the glorious weeks to come destroying horde with that hammer. 
---
2. It became so competitive for Honor that we would Q WSG and have a "Scout" enter. There was only one group we couldn't steam roll. If it was that group in the other team, we would drop Q and re Q. 
---
It wasn't that we couldn't beat them, but the games could take 30 minutes. When you are grinding rank 14s, you just didn't have time for that when you could win 3 games in that time. Again, alliance had instant Qs. Horde could not do the same thing. 
---
This is to give perspective on how serious teams may have to Q again if it works the same way. 
---
Everyone want to see good games, but good games are not what made rank 14s.
---
Has anybody confirmed that anger management has the proper (different to what the talent description says) behaviour in classic beta? i.e giving flat rage instead of slowing decay like says on the tooltip
---
Early on you could but not in the later patches I believe.
---
I see where you're coming from. The thing is, I'm happy to test the content. It's just been a really hard year. A lot of bad things have happened. In pve I can kind of chill and be happy. I can test out things I remember and give feedback and report errors as needed, and I do. PvP is a lot more stressful. Right now I dont do well with stress. It was probably a bad idea to make this post. I just really wished they would have had an event like they do with stress tests for this weekend as well. That would have been great for everyone.
---
Awesome picture!
---
What do you mean? That's grade A natural splendor right there
---
So BC saved Vanilla from Naxxramas which was making the previous content irrelevent by making all of the Vanilla content including naxx irrelevent ?
---
Great idea
---
This 100% I played Vanilla  Ret all the way to 60 before I ever healed anything. First time was AQ 40 and I showed up with my unstoppable force. The rl kept me in because they needed my wife to heal.
---
Meters are useful, but it doesn't really paint an entire story, just the end point. For instance, a healer might have top HPS, but maybe they got the Innervates, and realistically the healing after that is because of something the Druid did for the healer.
---
The best thing a DPS meter does is tell you who's slacking off. I'm much more interested in seeing who's underperforming,  than who's doing 1.2% more DPS than 2nd Rogue on the DPS chart.
---
Which is why DPS meters exist at all. Before that, it was super common to have a ton of DPS slackers who would just sit there and auto attack.
---
So theres a lot of chugga chugga? Im a huge deftones fan and love that stephan carpenter gets a lot of influence from meshuggah.
---
It’s fun as a 60 to kill a 17-21 who is fishing? Why?
---
is that a serious question? if so i'll give you a serious answer.
---
It's ok not to like a guy but he reacted about as little as you possibly could in this clip
---
Right!
---
Fwiw..... I'm going shaman
---
Blizzard, how dare you make midoriya cry :(
---
I find it to be considerably less stressful than 5 man healing, with the exception of maybe being on "dispel quickly or we wipe" duty or something like that.
---
LFR is actually a good way to ease into it without putting too much pressure on yourself.
---
Well said.
---
&gt; ROFL I have summoned the Incels!
---
Fuck you are a deplorable human being.
---
Weird, when I saw it on stream it looked crazy bright. I know the beta has some kind of brightness or bloom setting you can turn on or off, maybe thats what it is.
---
Making a male night elf Hunter.  I'll switch servers until I can reserve drizzt or entreri 🤷
---
Theres just so many iconic meshuggah riffs in the album and its in my opinion alot more digestable then when they fell off the deep end with crazy time signatures and grating dissonance, but meshuggah in general is a super meditative, trance-like band. This one just clicks with me and djents real hard. Thinking about it now i can see how deftones guitar work could be construed as meshuggah influenced for sure
---
Depends on what you compare it to. In retail WoW it can be very stressful, you're constantly putting out fires but sooner or later you will get overwhelmed.
---
I'm Classic it can be very comfortable if you have a good team leading the raid so every healers are assigned to heal a small group of people or even a single person.
---
Priest is the healer with the most healing spells though. It makes them powerful but it can be a lot to deal with. Druids and paladins are more straight forward.
---
You think you are right about "You think you do but you don't" but you are not.
---
In a later patch they chained him to Blasted Lands
---
Babies have no hair
---
He'll yeah brother well do it together
---
6 months? Like February 2020?
---
The problem isn't about if you can do it or not, the problem is if its worth doing it.
---
In retail you can do a lot of things classic wow is praised for. You can form your own group before going to a dungeon/raid, you can go to that raid by walking. You can level up your profession as you level your character. Everybody has the ability to party with other characters, add them to their friendlist etc. If you want PvP you can activate war mode, etc, etc (there is only a few things you can't do in retail, like 40 man raids).
---
A lot of people wanted the old alterac, not because you could do things that were removed by the game, but because the design was to be a really long battle, which you can leave for whatever reason and after that join again.
---
Because the topic is constantly brought up. I downvoted automatically until I read the quality of it.
---
Most of the farms spots are well known, it is wether if the farm spot is lucrative or not. This one seems to be average when compared to others, but still a nice one to do while leveling (even though it is too near Tanaris to my taste), so I doubt all of them will be over farmed/ineffective.
---
I think an alternative timeline would have increased level caps, otherwise it'd just be new L60 content, so yes, you would be able to go back and solo old content.
---
In my Snapshot hypothetical, you could start a new toon on a TBC server and level up through Pre-TBC content, but few people would be farming it like they would be over on the still-running Classic server.  
---
&gt;One once I’ve moved my toon to tbc, I can’t go back, right?
---
No, once you've cloned to TBC, you can't backport gear/gold/rep to the L60 Classic server.  
---
I'm not sure whether cloning from Classic to TBC should continue to be allowed indefinitely (as long as a character hasn't previously been cloned) or if it should only be an opt-in (or opt-out) feature available for a few weeks up until the launch of the new TBC release.  
---
I'm leaning towards the latter.
---
Have a look at this outline of a possible horizontal progression system, this would obviously fall in the "New L60 content" option.  
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dn_W3tjsqXXkQdoQ7QWL9UvIZ1KOIm3jk6BPMbWIIHI
---
You're also level 58 and most of the template gearsets are garbage, from what I've seen.
---
66.33 repeating of course.
---
"ignoring the fact that you already showed that you clearly didn't even play on these private servers by bringing  up streamers?" Are you okay man? How does that prove anything? I think you need to relax and use logic how is that a support to an argument at all? I think you should go back to watching asmongold and watch him collecting mounts. And the ques were not that bad at all on nost you may not know this but you can still get honor from av even after exalted! I know right! Are you serious in thinking you would be lucky to get into one av a week on a private server? Are you really going to stick by that point?
---
Got there by ye olde wall jumping. There was a big rectangular hole in an unfeatured plane.
---
Yes. I have multiple bulging discs and spinal stenosis. I just take breaks and ice packs. Stand up when you are on a taxi flight. Step away for a while. naybe get a Tens unit. They are great.
---
jesus fuck and holy shit rip my ears
---
Pets don't ever die in dungeons unless the hunter is really bad.
---
In raids yeah, I can somewhat aggree.
---
only while sitting? there are desks which can be lifted up so you can play while standing if you feel like it
---
Solid response
---
The Shimmering Flats is my favorite place of all places in WoW, because nostalgia. Might end up in there sooner or later and make this grind (or try the bug dudes to the east). Seems to be not so lucrative, but I still like the place.

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII'M HOOKED ON A FEELING
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrI-UBIB8Jk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrI-UBIB8Jk)
---
Lol ok Lore.
---
A lot of streamers have been turning down the effects with a console command. This makes it look a lot gloomier than usual.
---
The reason he went to eight string is meshuggah. I love how we highjacked this comments section. I love the fucked up time signatures they got into. Looking forward to Nothing’s djents.
---
Start doing stretch and posture exercises now. Every flight path and ship/zep trip, get up and do the same stretches or take a short walk.
---
Make sure you're sitting correctly with feet flat on the floor, thighs parallel to the ground, and in a chair with lower back support.
---
If you need a new chair, you can get one from Office Max (and similar stores) for cheap by buying the protection plan and then making a claim against it as soon as anything about it starts bothering you (squeaking, dimples in padding, etc). They 100% never ask for the chair back and just send a check for the full amount of the chair while expecting people to forget they ever bought the protection plan.
---
I feel a lot of hate on this post from people who claim the classic community will be super friendly and helpful
---
&gt; It was a whole different ballgame in vanilla tho. Trash mobs ran away, if your pet was on it you better be quick to call it back or it might go and pull extras
---
Ctrl+2 isn't that hard to do, specially if you are a DPS class
---
We're being given a lemon.  When I'm in AV, I'll be trying my damnedest to make lemonade.
---
You're watching a twitch streamer force a turtle
---
Yeah, sitting for too long causes me a lot of grief, might look into it in the future.
---
May I ask what a tens unit is?
---
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcutaneous\_electrical\_nerve\_stimulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation)
---
Slightly more than a nines unit.
---
I think he means the hunter deadzone perhaps, which is instrumental in balancing the hunter class in PvP.
---
Getting fired might be the best thing that ever happened.
---
As others have said, not that stressful.
---
Sometimes if you’re assigned to heal the tanks or MT it can be stressful in a fight that you might be under geared for. 
---
That said, having healed from Vanilla to now, I found vanilla the most forgiving overall because there were more players in a raid and if you F’d up more people had your back.  The only trade of is you had to be more mana conscious back then.
---
Honestly it looks like all the best parts of holy, and most of ret. If you dont mind being slightly worse in raid it's fine. Great spec for pvp and 5 mans.
---
New job
---
GMs would despawn them after a bit. No reason to shut the server down though...
---
You could bring servants too, and they would aggro npcs (and make them noninteractable). They didn't kill people, but honestly were more annoying since you could take them to the IF AH (mobs would leash at BRM, but since the servants were humanoid, you could MC them over that spot).
---
Middle school was quite depressing. High school was a lot better. Now I'm working, and it's super depressing again, so I'd say it's a perfect time for Classic.
---
They can not invite you to raids
---
Before classic was announced I was in a wotlk pserver and alterac was my favourite bg, so I will enjoy any version of alterac, (usually, my guild tried to make it +40 mins bg, and that is a lot for that version). But I understand why a lot of people won't like it.
---
Lol oh man. That is rich. 
---
You give FAR to much power to streamers. 
---
And Madseasons is not a steamer. Yes, he streams, but he's done far more in spreading content about wow than many others. He's the master of monotone and an excellent YouTube creator. Ya know, just in case you did not know. 
---
I will say it again. It's going to be fine. 
---
😀
---
People will almost always take a rogue over an enhance shaman though.
---
They're still OP as hell in PvE and fine in 5 mans. They just won't be doing too hot in the damage meters, that's all. As others have said they bring enough utility to still invite a few.
---
My neck of the woods.
---
Shit this setup is legit though need that neck cushion
---
holy shit this made me burst out laughing 
---

Sounds like a company that you don't rally want to have a future with if that's the expectation
---
The original monks
---
Literally the druid forms all have the tooltip saying "makes you immune to polymorph".
---
But we’re all adults this time around!  We can read more good!
---
This is a beta where no one gives a rats ass about rep, honor, etc. I've been in multiple 20 min AVs already, the ONLY reason anyone is turtling is just to force it dude. I'm in one right now with a 'big streamer' doing exactly that
---
But we’re all adults this time around... and we can read more good!
---
AV &gt; AB &gt; EotS &gt; WSG &gt; that thing with the boats
---
That's about all I remember for BGs.
---
I read all of it and greatly enjoyed it. 
---
Tldr: pvp grind was tough and memorable, and this is OP's personal account of witnessing it on his server back in the day.
---
The title of the post also acts as a summary.
---
So you're saying I can't have it for my meme spec because you need it for your meme spec?
---
I dunno, I find it more straight forward.  
---
CC spells actually work for a decent amount of time and your damaging abilities actually do what they are supposed to.  You also don’t need a set of special PVP gear like you would in retail (although BFA sort of adjusted this a bit). 
---
I think what makes it “hard” is PvP back then wasn’t nearly as balanced as it is now, and certain classes will absolutely wreck.
---
That's why you're raid leader when you can do whatever you want ezpz
---
&gt;"all while people your age went to parties with their friends, nurtured relationships, and had important life experiences"
---
I mean, is getting together with 19 other people to play a videogame (WoW raid) any less social than going to a party? Is it impossible to nurture relationships among guildmates? And I have plenty of important life experiences / memorable events throughout my history with WoW.
---
Go for legomyegolas... bis legolas name.
---
Or a really bad restoration
---
Kinda wanted a girlfriend, but nah. WoW:Classic will never go out with my friend after dumping me. In fact, WoW: Classic is better with friends, and it only costs $14.99 a month.
---
"Content relevance" is not really a thing that matters in terms of player engagement. If Naxx gets thrown into the garbage bin, it doesn't matter as long as people have stuff to do and the game is in a healthy state. What matters are questions like "what is the new player experience like for someone joining the expansion at point X and jumping into PvP" or "do players have a reason to participate in dungeon content". 
---
Got it? Drop this meme idea that we need to keep Molten Core alive, because "keeping Molten Core alive is somehow critical to the success of WoW". It isn't.
---
Damn that is beautiful
---
My setup is already turning into he who has no life guy from southpark.
---
Before my desk was spotless before now I have a little side table for food and shit plus an extra trash can for all my beer bottles. 
---
August cant come soon enough.
---
True. People can just choose to join other guilds tho :p
---
can't have mouse over macros in Classic.
---
Let's land an alien ship there or something.
---
LOL, so Blizzard can bring back thousands of players original gaming addiction.
---
I'm not claiming any fact. I presented my own anecdotal evidence after saying I don't believe something without seeing the statistics they're claiming.
---
I'm ready to admit I'm wrong in the face of some sort of source on these statistics.
---
If you can sit in different postions (ie, not a chair) you could look into a controller with keymapping software. While it can feel a bit clunky it will be perfectly fine for levelling. I just wouldn't try PvP or mid-high level dungeons or raids.
---
Druids (feral/resto) are the best flag runners, imo. They are also great levelers and are the most mana efficient healers with down ranking healing touch
---
and going back to private servers?
---
no one wants to trust a private server host with their avatars and their progress.
---
this is why private servers suck, rampant admin abuse. people have come to trust blizzard and the community they created. people dont just go back to private servers if the game died.. its such a baseless assumption.
---
Not stressful if you enjoy while you're playing with. From early server first MC, to killing Maexanna in Naxx before they fixed the Line of sight bug... I had a fucking blast bro
---
Ah, a fellow person of culture!
---
&gt;lay for to
---
are you able to or have you tried a sit to stand desk? the automated ones that you set your sitting height and your standing height and just press a button to swap would be good for you
---
Master of the dance.  No other class has so many different dances.
---
I will be rolling a human priest. Aesthetics &gt; fear ward.
---
Is there anyway to justify rolling a Tauren Hunter other than liking the look?
---
Umm you mean people pick Horde for PvP racials and Alliance for PvE right?
---
Because what you said was wrong. 
---
Alliance are better for PvE and that's why on Vanilla they usually had better gear when they PvP'd, Horde got more PvP geared players but that took time to obtain in comparison to raid gear.
---
I still am waiting for these statistics that state people want to be on the "OP" faction.
---
My own experience just doesn't see that as a truth and beyond that I just find it incredibly hard to believe. It reeks of an asspull IMO.
---
There's no need to lose control just because you made a fool out of yourself. Resorting to insults to cover up your own lack of knowledge doesn't work when it's this blatant, just makes you look immature.
---
Nostalrius was half a decade ago by now, and had a ridiculous 12k pop. More recent servers had more faithful implementations of pre-nerf AV, as well as usually more modest populations. Everyone hated it. You'd just get 30vs30 people standing AFK at some chokepoint while raging at each other in BG chat and moving every 5 minutes to prevent getting kicked.
---
I dare you to join the largest current vanilla private server (I'm sure even you can find it) and ask in world chat what the general population thinks of pre-nerf Alterac Valley.
---
Go play in the lounge.  
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/console-port
---
They are best flag carriers in WSG, but aside from that and their unique utility (Battle Rez), they really are the classic "jack of all trades" trope. So if you don't value that versatility, there's little mechanical incentive to play one.
---
Funny but off limits.
---
i healed as a priest for MC, ZG, BWL, and a bit of AQ. Found it relatively low stress, but I think it depends on the rest of the team and raid leadership
---
Hope you pick a class that can get training in Nelf zones.
---
This really pisses me off and is so inaccurate. Actually, tens of thousands of gamers will be reliving the most depressing era of our lives.
---
I killed myself because someone told me to call a hotline one time too many
---
If I didn't spec anything into improved slam, is it still worth using it in my dps rotation with a 2h?
---
"Beloved dungeouns like Uldaman"  well that's really the only thing they got wrong out of all that LOL
---
I think he means that's hes copying the mannerisms and tone which tbh seems to be the case but I love both streamers
---
Scarlet crusade raid and dragon isles sound so awesome, great post!
---
That and fear ward make them the unrivalled priest choice
---
&gt; spammable spells they can cast, which will do more damage than their ranged
---
The wand for most casters would beg to differ at low levels
---
Honestly the Gorilla is probably the best leveling pet.
---
Too much sexy.
---
Thank you finally a comment not about changes
---
Dude, this is one of favorite posts in a while. I have a herniated disc from jiu jitsu and tight muscles in lower and thoracic back. I also took two weeks off after release. Plan on 10 to 12 hour sessions each day. 
---
I say do some yoga in the morning. Good stretches are under rated. Get a foam roller and take a five minute break from your gaming session if you get too tight.
---
Low key the article author was only able to write such a narrowly set story because of intense familiarity and being busy preparing for Classic.
---
I feel like some people don't even read  lol
---
They can shift out making them effectively immune
---
Money from sold house goes straight to divorced wife....but yeah you still have WoW

Wait, this isn't orgrimmar...

Hey I was on Aegwyn alliance side.

Y'all trashed us.

---
Warrior Tauren is absolutely absurd in Beta. Completely up there with Orc if not better in many situations
---
Yeah, I didnt expect to love his streams that much but he's just 100% positive energy. So different from most others which cultivate the most toxic chat
---
Eww...yes please go back to retail.
---
Does it need to be a laptop? you can get a more powerful machine for less if you just get a desktop and build it yourself. Building a computer yourself is very easy first time you do it and its like "is that it? surely there's more!" but nope.
---
i think it was actually 33.33 or 33.34 repeating
---
Can someone explain?
---
Exactly. Just so she can complain about it....
---
This. Is. Fantastic.
---
It’s more likely he’s paid salary + all those other things.
---
You haven't been through any battles with him, no memories.  
---
Another of the weaknesses of retail is that its so easy that you never go through the trials that attach you to your character.
---
One of the best eras of my life for many reasons! Vanilla was just one of them and I can't wait to have it BACK!
---
???
---
The game is perfect as it is.
---
Every spec has its place.
---
If you give for example shadow a set, they might be too strong in PvP, they are already the kings of 1v1. Everything is viable just for a different reason, you play an oomkin because you want to be a clown not because you want to be good damage in raids.
---
I’ve been afraid of changing cause I’ve built my life around you
---
Stop complaining about the band-aid and wait for it to do its job.
---
Play Classic, level from 1-60, by the time you’re 60 you’ll know your class and your skills well enough to do well. Plenty of good loot that isn’t in raids, wether it’s high end dungeons or crafting, or PvP rewards.
---
Never heard this idea before.
---
So, as someone who showed up super late in classic, like literally a few months before BC dropped and didn't even get into BC until a few months after launch. Perhaps someone can help me kind of understand peoples arguments.  
---
I see a lot of people saying that AV is basically the free epics BG this way, which kind of makes sense to me, cause I remember the epics and needing marks which came from wins. However, I also see people saying they are free epics when the servers will only have MC, but like currently (and this is where I'm getting confused.) AV wouldn't release in phase 1, but phase 3 with BWL maybe, the list seem to have changed slightly on Wowhead about the phases since I last seen them.   
---

---
So my question is, are the epics from AV better than stuff from BWL which is why they are being called free epics, or is there a misconception that AV will be released at launch?
---
I like female's animations more than the Male.
---
Let's be real, its fucking Keanu Reeves, he's good at every fucking role.
---
I believe you're missing an important point here. Nobody played old AV for honor.
---
lol yeah this whole adult thing aint workin so well
---
Sounds like a bully to me.
---
Nice
---
Well... "if you just had gotten an education, you wouldn't be in this situation". You could've had that dream career of a hyper productive consumer.
---
They were a bit exaggerated with what they said, but theres no doubt a lot of their mannerisms and actions are eerily similar. They can have different opinions but still act the same
---
lmao "duping" that clickbait
---
im bullying you because i wanted to make sure you wanted to seriously discuss the intricacies of ganking lowbies.
---
ok bud.
---
Layering is not phasing. You are supposed to be moved to the party leaders layer if not already there. Having said that, yes it will be susceptible to people abusing it. I'm not going to discredit Blizzard for trying this, and I will only keep up hope that they are able to eliminate layering as fast as possible as they are planning. Which last I read was a few weeks after release.
---
I figured this! So in classic , crafted items were valuable..
---
The guy you want is TheMechanic98
---
No the bullying is ganking lowbies. Where’s the sport in that? You like stepping on puppies or hitting toddlers?
---
Now show me Ironforge IRL
---
I've wondered that too, even as a healer who has damn near every ability as a mouseover or cursor macro.
---
I had one macro on my hunter that was a little more complex like this so I could use Misdirect on the tank *or* my pet, all with one keybind, but I've never found a single need for anything more than mouseover spellname.
---
Obviously in Classic, cancelling your mount aura is also a good addition, and class specific things like shadow form make sense, but I've never been able to find a clear answer on what the help, and nodead parameters are actually required for.
---
Can anyone help answer this please? I don't doubt there must be a good reason but as someone who's done arenas and raids as a healer with the most basic macros ever, it seems like the help and nodead parameters are built into the spell itself, so I feel like I'm missing something important.
---
&gt; https://postimg.cc/k6KYjs9n/36c46e58
---
Holy shit, thank you! I would have never seen that otherwise and it's actually quite badass!
---
It's funny, I played a balance druid from Vanilla till half way through TBC (then switched to feral) but somehow never figured out what the heck that was lol.
---
No, I'm stuck here on the boards.
---
ok so you do want to talk about why it's fun to gank lowbies?
---
No man. These are amazing. Keep going.
---
To be fair, weren't they just hyper camping that chick?
---
Very, some of them are BiS items until AQ/Naxx which is very end game
---
The main argument of most of the "no changers" is that they don't want the old content to become irrelevent, yours is compeltely different you are mostly about the new player experience and the gear difference between newbies and naxx raiders that's interesting
---
Actually I think the new player experience would be much better with my additional content than the base game, most of it actually adds better gearing options for non raiders (higher tier dungeons) and higher rewards from "casual" raids (20 men mode). 
---
But outside of that I don't think the newbies suffer much, the PVP gear already very strong so if you rank up a bit you can have strong equipment from pvp only.
---
 Maybe the PVP gear should be a bit stronger to be more competitive mostly since only the highest ranks are really good and casuals can't get it but if you buff pvp gear too much then pve content becomes irrelevent you just get gear in PVP instead of doing raids. Which is what the resilience gear solved in TBC... But resilience has many issues, wasn't very well balanced and nobody wants it in classic imo even if it solves this problem
---
[Done](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/5/52/Peter_Jackson%27s_Moria.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110313211305).
---
Is this a copy pasta at this point?
---
Depends who you are.  
---
If you're me, it's the most stressful thing you've done in WoW.  
---
I'm a goddamn horrible healer. I just plain suck at it. I've raided in every role in the game and healing was by far my most nervous time.
---
This feels like a "no duh" situation. Most of Classic WoW's content, viewed in isolation as a specific module, doesn't hold up in 2019. It's the social and meta-progression context that makes the content fun.
---
ehhh on flasks in vanilla
---
Pretty common for friends to have similar inflections and inside jokes.
---
Yoga is the solution to the vast majority of body aches.  Our bodies need to move, and of story.  Look into a physiotherapist to figure out what you can do and start moving
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
FFS, it's called sharding, not phasing. Phasing is when a zone changes after you complete a quest line.
---
Yes Exactly, also it's like retail in the sense everyone has similar ilvl gear also they don't have their engineering items.
---
What I find fun about classic pvp is that it's unbalanced and random and this AV test server removed those things. Streamers in world pvp,duels,WSG and AB are having tons of fun. And im sure in AV with their own characters they would enjoy it much more.
---
kind of a tasteless joke tbh
---
This video is in Classic, not a private server, so yes, you can have these Classic, even if it wasn't a thing in vanilla. Focus is still not in Classic though.
---
I'm going to miss my two retail characters that have been my mains since vanilla. Like the end of an era. But I don't think it'll be hard to get attached to a few additional ones. Vanilla makes it easy. Just have to make the memories. Beta isn't the way to do that, it's temporary. So I wouldn't worry.
---
&gt; I still am waiting for these statistics that state people want to be on the "OP" faction.
---
I'm not about to spend an hour scrounging up the blue post where they talk about it, but I remember Ion also mentioned it at the Blizzcon where they announced BfA's War-mode. Essentially, every time they've done free realm transfers, they've noticed that people transfer to realms where their faction is more dominant, not the other way around.
---
As for your backwards take on which factions are popular for which content, here's a quote from an article:
---
&gt; "We've been looking at high-end participation in raids and other activities where, over time, **a lot of the high-end communities gravitated Horde,"** he said, "partly because past racial imbalances that we have largely remedied.”
---
&gt; Hazzikostas said the game has seen some imbalance in the types of activities players pursue since the beginning. Alliance is "potentially a little bit" more likely to include more casual players, he said.
---
&gt; "Historically PvP is where that's seen a lot," he said. **"Horde has had longer queues for things like battlegrounds, going way, way back.** In the early origins of World of Warcraft, the the PvP servers tended to be the ones that were more Horde-favored. There's something emotionally about looking at an orc and saying yep, that is the expression of my identity that I want in this game, that maybe correlates a bit more strongly with PvP."
---
yeah easy raid healing is shaman, spam that chain heal down ranked twice
---
I blame staysafe for being a piece of shit in the first place
---
Ohhh fuck, I meant after Naxxramas!! I didn't even realize what I wrote lol
---
That's how someone who didn't play WoW felt about us.
---
Imagine seeing someone play a game so fun and addicting that they don't want to live their life. A game so fun they spend 18 hours a day on it.
---
And you pitty me? I PITTY YOU FOR NOT PLAYING THIS GAME
---
I wasn't aware there was a comedy perimeter.  Can you send me a copy of the Official Comedy Rulebook?
---
Woah look at this guy with his mortgage!
---
I think Staysafe plays it cool but it actually irritates the hell out of him.
---
Hand of Rag is for meme specs anyways. It's also expensive to make. A Warrior is better off with Bonereaver's Edge and it's easier to acquire.
---
&gt; Watching ClassiCast, it came to mind that: what if Blizzard stretches Classic by adding new content post Naxx, and after that releases TBC Classic. New content, TBC Classic... it doesn't have to be a choice between the two if one doesn't harm the other. We'd get to enjoy WoW's two golden eras a bit longer (let's be realistic: Classic will be ~2 years before Naxx is cleared, which isn't that very long, and the same for TBC), and it gives Blizzard the chance to realize the content that they had on the drawing table, but couldn't before TBC.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; The only problem I can foresee with prolonging Classic beyond Naxx, is that by the time people get Naxx gear, people will start to get very squishy in PvP. If only Blizzard, or specifically: Kevin Jordan, had the foresight to add Resilience to PvE gear from the start of Vanilla, this would've been easier to deal with now with Classic.
---
No Changers are already not going to play your content. That's a foregone conclusion. 
---
For the people who want to play new content, they don't want to be weighed down by old content. Your solution is literally the worst of both worlds. People who want to play only the old content don't want to play your content, people who want to play new content don't want to have to progress through old content to get to the new content. 
---
And no, buffing PvP gear is not the solution. The vanilla honor system is crap. It's just straight dog-shit. It was an honest try from their dev team, they went out and tried to do something creative, but it's a disaster. Nobody likes a "PvP" system that has less to do with skill-based PvP and more to do with whether you are unemployed. Any Classic+ that insists on keeping the honor system as the primary source of PvP gear is going to be a joke to any skill-based PvPer.
---
You forgot about getting ganked in Stranglethornn Vale
---
There isn’t much wiggle room gear wise between Naxx and a few levels of quest drop gear later. You can’t redo itemization in TBC because then it throws off everything pretty substantially after that.  So, then, what you’re looking at is something marginally better, and probably not worth the difference. At that point you’re probably looking to set bonuses to make the difference. Also, speaking from experience, even in full Naxx DPS gear people in PvP gear can still survive decently in a group scenario, minus the extremes. When we played Macabre in Vanilla they ran 2 Atiesh mages fully flasked/potted and they melted people every time a cooldown was up, but again this is the far extreme, and they melted just as quickly to melee in PvP gear without cooldowns.
---
&gt; Don't forget that raiding guilds used instance runs as a method of weeding out incompetent
---
True. That's how I got into a raiding guild. Via a recommendation from someone I was running dungeons with.
---
Just curious, why did they choose 58 instead of 59?
---
Thanks for the feedback! Appreciate it.
---
Looks like a World Tree cut off at the stump.
---
As much as I loved wow classic, I was also very addicted to the game world of war craft in my early teens. As the game changed, the more it drove me away from it. Still really happy it's coming back! But I know if I start again what I will turn into again.
---
That’s a better time to book off, imo. Launch week will be server queues, crashes, and waiting for your mobs to respawn. Two weeks after launch is where the real grind happens.
---
Literally on the front page of this sub

Let's do it guys.

---
&gt;which isn't that very long Classic will be ~2 years before Naxx is cleared, which isn't that very long
---
Reliving a 15 year old game for 2 years... it is plenty long enough.
---
&gt; A lot of people wanted the old alterac, not because you could do things that were removed by the game, but because the design was to be a really long battle, which you can leave for whatever reason and after that join again.
---
Even in old AV, as soon as people figured out how to get the most honor it became the same 40v40-run-past-each-other-and-race-to-the-final-boss as current AV. Even when Korrak was a thing people still ended up doing this strat. **It's a player culture problem now.** It doesn't matter which version of AV they implement, it won't ever be a 3-day event like in Vanilla.
---
Why do people think more npcs = longer AV? Several private servers have had AV with shredders, mines, guards, captains, etc. **People still just ignore everything they can, kill whatever gives honor and then rush for the last boss.** The BGs end in around 15-mins even with all the npcs.
---
I'm handicapped now so I don't work so I actually have more time to do those things than I did when I was 21 when I first started playing wow.
---
Blizzard is never going to spend a single dollar developing new content for Classic. They have two goals:
---
1. Push the shit they already have out the door as soon as it works on the modern engine and figure out as many ways to cut costs, especially where Game Master involvement is concerned.
---
2. Figure out a way to convert Classic players over to Retail where they can sell expansions and microtransactions, which is over half their revenue.
---
If #2 takes too long (Retail will need to slowly change over time, but the level squish to 60 is a huge sign), then they’ll do #1 again with TBC.
---
You’re never getting new Classic content.
---
What’s this place?
---
Well my content and everythnig i said  wasn't mean for No changers anyway, this is only for Changers. 
---
I edited my post and added some stuff :  Maybe we can overbuff pvp gear and make it usable only in Battlegrounds ? 
---
The highest ranks would be the higher PVE gear(naxx or higher), and the casual ranks(under 10) would be like 0.5 tier weaker
---
So hardcore pvpers still have an advantage on casual pvp players and are competitive to top pve players. Casuals pvp players now aren't much weaker than top pve and pvp players (like 10/20%) but still weaker.
---
Even in a changes server i don't think anyone would want that anyway even if it is better and more balanced, that's just core chanegs to the systems not just additional content.
---
He reported them, I'm pretty sure they triggered him.
---
Just for a bit of extra salt in the wounds, when you hover over the greyed out play button you get "You can't play WoW Classic yet" Yeah, I know :(
---
shut the fuck up
---
They did it because people had trouble uninstalling the game
---
Playing Druid is like trying to eat a meal with a Swiss Army knife. You’d rather have a fork and knife and spoon, but if you can’t fit all of those in your bag, the 3-in-1 will do.
---
It's been so long....
---
Hey there, I'd like to do this with the latest version of the map as you didn't update it yet, can you explain me really quickly how I do it?
---
Overpower will never pop for you if you’re behind the target like you should be.
---
It's quite funny because, yesterday mods removed almost the same thread. One sentence and exactly the same picture
---
This was usually the way it went in vanilla, minus the streamer. The reason old AVs were so long was several people would just force a turtle and 80 people would be stuck for several days.
---
Ok man. No talking to you.
---
But again. It looks fun and fine. 
---
ANd again.. STOP giving streamers that much power bro. Just ignore them, man.
---
NoobTaco OUT

Flag runner in gulch, point holder in basin. Needed in every group. Would suggest resto.

Fun fact, going here in Classic puts you into "no zone" meaning no general chat and people checking where you are see "Unknown". Dieing here sends you to Westfall. Or if you're horde, Crossroads. I tested it out during the last stress test :D surprised that the Horde get their default graveyard instead of both factions using Westfall like back then
---
Lul the guy constantly makes fun of himself
---
 He clearly reported them because he makes for good entertainment when he pretends to be bothered by all the smeagol/neckbeard/no hair etc. Memes about him. He doesnt give 2 shits about them calling out his hairline man. Literally every wow video has an asmonbald comment in the top 3 spot and he delibrilitraly seeks them out. It's just good entertainment man. However, if people cant read when he is being real and when hes just entertaining I do understand why they must hate him. I'm sure there are people who thinks he actually think he is a literal God:D
---
looks like moria to me
---
Wait, that's a thing? I traversed the entire coast hugging the mountains best I could but it never zoned me into Winterspring or Moonglade, I went from Azshara and it was "unknown zone" until Darkshore
---
Apparently in beta the pick up quests item respawn near instantly so you shouldnt skip these quests.
---
I'm a casual and don't give a fuck
---
very goods
---
I would prefer an expanded classic WoW via horizontal content over TBC altogether.  Just keep the level cap at 60, stay on Azeroth, and add new zones, instances, and battlegrounds within the framework of WoW Classic.
---
How come?
---
If by balancing classes you mean homogenizing them, then I agree. Class balance (specifically hybrids) was one of Vanillas biggest flaws, and TBC's best features.
---
Class design and balance became exponentially better in TBC/Wotlk.
---
The mass homogenization began in Cata and sent the game off a cliff. I know LFG was introduced in wotlk, but for my money Cata was truly the beginning of the end. It simply didnt feel like WoW anymore.
---
I agree with you that Naxx destorys the game Pupper.
---
How the crap is 15 gold per hour possible at 40 through normal means?

Only from the point of view of non gamers. HA!

Nah, just a silly pun on "Me Sugar" because I ruined the meta and went female.
---
Pretty much. You have access to a lot of what Rogues, Warriors, Healers/Casters can do, but none of the specialized powerful things they can do.
---
They're definitely interesting in vanilla. In raiding, pretty much everyone outshines you. I think its really only in wPvP where they shine brightest, but their kiting style doesn't appeal to a lot of people.
---
Playing a Druid is like having an answer to every problem, but never the best answer to any specific problem.
---
Ancient city called Hadhodrond under three mountains called Bundushathûr, Barazinbar, and Zirakzigil. The people who lived there are long gone. No one really knows too much about them but this one WWI veteran from England, who later became a professor, figured out a good portion of their language.
---
Yet we can't prove it.

Hey, student in chiropractic school right now- best advice is what everyone else is giving you, move every now and then! Sitting position is very structurally loading to the spine and surrounding muscles, so simply standing, walking, doing some light stretching can go a looooong ways. Research done in office settings have shown workers are much more productive when incorporating simple standing or walking breaks, roughly 5-10 mins long, every hour or so. My best advice would be to take a nice walk around the neighborhood before you start for the day, then set a timer on your phone for roughly every hour and take a break for 5 or so minutes when it goes off. Walk to the kitchen, grab a snack, use the RR, replenish your water etc. Sounds simple but I promise you this makes a world of a difference for every office working / low-back pain related patient we see in our school’s clinic. Hope this helps!

Druids are the least gear dependant healers in early vanilla. You can get away, so damage mitigation on gear is less important. If you can't get away you can go bear form. If your gear doesn't have a lot of intellect you can innervate yourself. You can sleep Hunter pets, you can charge in bear form to help get away. You have an insta dot for rogues. So much more. You will be flag carrier in WSG. Back in vanilla I raided and PVPed with the same spec and I healed BWL and I tanked Rag as a bear, all the same spec.

I figure i can collect enough bottles for subscription and rice right?

Horde scum I will hunt you down

The whole point of Classic+ is horizontal content. Adding TBC negates everything in Classic WoW. It makes Classic WoW mean nothing. PupperDog seems to not understand that or something. Adding more raids that are the same level as MC,BWL etc.. gives players more options where to gear. The issue of gear inflation could be countered if new tier sets allowed players to create new builds based on the new gear.
---
The game is very easy in general. The work comes from pre-game, in retail the skill comes from in-game.

So in War for Lordaeron, how does the Alliance get involved? The Scarlet Crusade fighting the Forsaken only really benefits them, right? Or is it more of an Argent Dawn thing? I’m curious. Great post, you should crosspost it into /r/classicwowplus if you haven’t already!
---
You're absolutely not wrong, the difference is just how 'easy' the different versions allow for that to happen
---
"Thankyou thankyou thankyou"
---
its mostly because AV is boring
---
Come on now, Classic WoW was where many a nerd lost their cherry in Goldshire.
---
To Frank.
---
Why would you do such a thing? If you need money, you tank dungeons.
---
More honor would be nice simple solution.
---
Is the rank 14 system built cross faction?
---
I was extrapolating off of your suggestion of eventually releasing TBC Classic as well, unless I misunderstood.  The problem with that, from a business perspective. is you’re more heavily cutting into the bottom line at that point because you’re diverting developers from “Retail” to create new Classic content. I do not think they’ll see an increase in the overall player base large enough to justify this.
---
Keeping a piss bucket can help you reduce bathroom break downtimes inbetween pulls. Definitely BiS.
---
If you only experience pain while sitting, I recommend getting a standing desk. They aren't cheap (for my frugal ass anyway).  They're usually around $150. They go cheaper, but you pay for what you get, and usually that means less desk space.
---
The desk can raise to a standing position and then be lowered back to a sitted position. People tend to do 1 hour up and 1 hour down for long work or gaming sessions.
---
If you're planning on doing a 3 week WoW adventure, this purchase would really be a game changer for you.

Anyone have recommendations for printing/framing services?

So I understand that cats are generally the best pet for raiding because of their damage modifier, but after looking over the pet families, I am also noticing that raptors have a similar +10% modifier. How close are they to cats in power level? I am asking because I am going to play a Troll so I'd like to use a raptor for flavor if the difference in DPS in negligible. Thanks!
---
This is the case in literally all games where the small upcoming content creators are trying to mimick the most succesful one.
---
In for example Osrs it is so obvious where most (especially the british ones) try to talk like Boaty.
---
I. D.o.n.t believe they were allowed to dual wield like that in vanilla. But I also don’t know. Nor do I understand why when I say I don’t know it comes out like I. D. o. n. t.
---
they are masters of mobility. 
---
which makes them the masters of wsg, the best battleground.
---
they are the best at some other stuff like escaping in wpvp, gathering, top 4 leveler.
---
they are also the only healer/tank with stealth which makes them great in AV and certain farms.
---
Fuck no! In 2004 I was a happy young child, now, in 2019, I am a depressed piece of shit that can't talk to other humans.
---
Posterburner.com. While you're at it, print one of the Azeroth maps 😝
---
Man these were the days... I miss the random friendly mage giving me a port to cities.
---
I'd like to grind for rep for some places.
---
i dont get it at all, no one seems to agree with me but the original AV was FAR different.
---
it wasnt an instance for one.. ( an instance is not a ZONE, it is a instance of a zone, a copy )
---
the original AV was a ZONE. this means there was only ONE AV per server.
---
because of that, it was a huge progression inside of AV, it went on for days.. there were tons of quests for basic stuff, taking mines, collecting materials to create npc forces for your side, you could respawn your forces, bolster them..
---
turning this shit into a raid type atmosphere IS NOT CLASSIC.
---
i fear blizzard is trying to put a bad show on for classic to kind of prove their original bs about us not wanting classic.
---
so confused.. this is actually really dumb, and most streamers seem to be going along with this trash. 
---
the original idea was anyone could contribute to the war in alterac valley.. even by just skinning animals, collecting meat or taking a mine ..
---
it was like warcraft 1-3 basically..
---
Nope.
---
Not sure you did your filtering right: https://classic.wowhead.com/weapons/class:11/slot:22
---
First time I’ve seen Aegwynn mentioned here! Were you in SSDD? Trying to remember the horde pvp guild as I was alliance, it’s been so long lol.
---
His point was that there is another school of changers : Just ignore the relevence of old content and go forward, focus on the new content and powercreep the hell out of it , add fast catch up for new players to jump to the newer content
---
Well... That's what retail WoW is doing atm.
---
I'm on the horizotnal content side too,  but  I just think that it would be fine if the later tiers were A BIT higher than Naxx, I don't think it would hurt the old content much.  Fully Horizontal can quickly get boring.
---
The problem with horizontal content is that you would have to make the new content harder than Naxx to make it challenging, but rewarding players that do harder content with equal rewards can be very frustrating... What do you do ? add mounts and cosmetic rewards and become retail with 200 mounts ? I don't even think a mount would be enough to motivate the players
---
That's what friends are for.
---
Meters tell you important things in addition to Damage Done.  Damage Taken, Damaged Who (for priority adds), Deaths, Interrupts, etc. all show how well you are performing your role.
---
PVP is WAAAAY down on the list of things I want in classic.
---
Just to be sure you know not EVERYONE is all about the PVP.
---
AND. . AV IS FINE!!! Looks like everyone is having fun.
---

---
I'm hoping there'll be a sequel to this.
---
Frankly I'd kick you and get an actual DPS. Hell I'd probably kick you if you tried to tank a 5 man with that spec.  You'd be endlessly rage starved and it would be a slow ass dungeon run.
---
BEARLY.
---
This dude sounds like what plain toast would sound like as a person.
---
The entire size of Eastern Kingdoms isn't even 20 square miles.   
---
The entire size of "Elwynn Forest" in the lore is most likely over 200 square miles, maybe even larger. Each zone is roughly the size of a US state? Even that is massive. Stormwind is really the size of a large village in reality.   
---
Stormwind's own population is 200,000. There should be thousands of game-Stormwind sized villages throughout the Alliance territory.   
---
We don't know the names of these non-existent lore cities. We don't know their locations. etc. We don't know the true population of the Defias Brotherhood. We don't really know their power. The lore and game contradict eachother. I love the game and the lore, the lore was made for the game but the game has clear fallacies in retrospect when you read the lore.   
---
I take this as a "game" analysis and not an actual lore analysis. Obviously just because the Defias have more territory than Stormwind does in game, doesn't mean it will or should be that way in the lore. Things will absolutely not be the same at all.
---
Its funny you say "in the shit".  It's accurate.  For gaming, that grind was so stupid, awesome, brutal, exhilarating- so many bonds were formed that I love all the memories of it but I'll never do it again.  Well, I hope not.  I fear I'll get the PVP-ranking bug again and go crazy like before.
---
I love reminiscing with old-ranking-system vets and still harbor old feelings of discrimination to Alliance.  What a unique time in MMOs.
---
what do you want to talk about ?
---
I wonder if those fake servers have all the NPC's though, I briefly watched a video someone posted in one of these AV threads and it looked like they were still using the "slim" version of the map after the patch that says an "avalanche" moved the trolls and gnolls out.  
---
Now i'm not talking about the trolls and gnolls being missing because that's not too relevant but I think perhaps if they are just guessing about what to add back in the might have just added the captains and lieutenants back in and missed all sorts of the generic guards that were also removed in two patch stages.  
---
What i'm getting at is can AV 40vs40 with all the true NPC's at their original implemented stats really be won in 15 minutes just with a modern attitude and approach?   
---
I played WoW classic and still vividly remember the advertising for AV as an ***upcoming patch*** on the first WoW website (beautiful website!) and I played it incessantly when it arrived live and I think if one team plus the original NPC's wants to block you by healing and moving with said NPC's you're going to have a hard time just charging through in 15minutes.
---
That list is wrong.  It's me doing the ganking in STV.  I rarely get ganked there.
---
cats look cooler
---
lol why do u link a clip of a guy thats slowed? leeway doesnt work for slowed targets in either direction
---
making rogue medics a viable option. Thanks to engineering
---
Florida coast is like a tropical getaway.
---
This is honest to God the truth. WoW got me through my tough, later teenage years.
---
The alliance wants loarderon territory back too, if 'im right in cataclysm the allaiance has big cities in the plaguelands
---
And yeah argent dawn and the dwarves clans in laorderon are big allies.
---
I know it's the onion or whatever, but man, life was a lot simpler and much more fun way back when vanilla was out. I was a much happier person in my 20s and miss the hell out of it, and though it was a small part of the reason why, I have a on of great memories with WoW and my university buddies.
---
I know what you mean by "bonds".  I have several lifelong friends and a lifelong wife I met in WoW.  I wouldn't trade my WoW experience for anything.
---
Here's something else.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p\_fT7Vy\_tow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_fT7Vy_tow)   This mage in curse in a world top 5 guild in Naxxramas gear with a flask/elixir/wizard oil is hitting 1300 with frostbolts.  You can be assured they're using rank 11 frostbolt.
---
Somehow this random mage on Ragnaros who's clearly less well geared and who isn't using wizard oil is doing 200 more damage with his frostbolts.
---
Did OP claim to have r14?
---
On Eredar Horde side : Jabralter, our guild leader and Tauren shaman. Great dude, they let my casual self stick around after the guild transitioned from casual PvP to hardcore raiding which I just didn’t have time for. I’m pretty sure the guy who soft tosses Ian hazzikostas his questions was in our guild too? 
---
Also remember Decimation, troll rogue and Fluid, Orc Hunter. 
---
On Doomhammer I remember anyone who was in Carpe Noctis or Solidarity. Especially Mandrella, our guild leader who burned himself out so badly during Wrath he just called it quits abruptly. I wonder if Classic is tempting him.
---
Huh... weird, I had the same selection as you but it came up with a bunch of stuff.
---
Welcome to capitalism
---
I'm torn. Friends of mine are going Horde, and I'm up for playing either faction. But Ironfoge was my home for most of WoW. Coziest capital city there is.
---
Aww streamers are getting bored? Poor streamers. /s can give a fuck about streamers and their feelings
---
Mmmm yea, it's this elitist mentality that us casuals will avoid. don't worry, I wouldn't pair up with someone like you to begin with.
---
&gt;pvp gear requiring Marks of AV will be incredibly hard to obtain because you only got them when the game ended
---
... come on man, stop trolling
---
But did you have a level 60 with all purples?
---
My life was so much better during vanilla. Wth the onion
---
Both of y'all deserve a very special medal for this incredible back-and-forth. Well done lads.
---
I love them!
---
If you're willing, I have 2 requests that might take some time because your maps all look very clean...
---
1st- Could we get a full res Vanilla map with the names of areas, icons, and level of zones in the style you made these?
---
2nd- Could we get a full res Classic+ edit of the above request, but including all the extra zones you've presented?
---
Ooga is the shit
---
Dw, I made a post the other day, but some hero's couldn't handle it. Nasty fucks. ( small minority btw not a generalisation.)
---
No they don't.
---
SSDD?! Ha!  That's where all our HWLs went too.  They were the premier PVE guild next to Shatter.  Or did SSDD change their name to Shatter??? Man its been too long.  I got to join the PVP guild because I was a rogue, and Skittlez (spelling?) just made HWL , left for SSDD, and vacated a rogue spot.
---
Our guild was Not Enough Players- named as such because when you queued in WSG the Alliance would all leave BG, leaving the system to prompt, "Not enough players, battleground closing in 10...9....8" or something to that effect.
---
Hi everyone, 
---
I'm trying different classes on a private server right now. I can't decide what to play and every day closer to classic wow is worst on my choice. 
---
The main problem is the time I have for myself and play wow. When I played in vanilla I was in highschool with a lot of time to play. Now I have a full-time job, a wife, 2 and soon 3 kids, a house, etc... 
---
So I want to have fun quickly when I login to wow. I don't want to wait much for dungeons and really like PVP.
---
During my wow years I mostly played healers and in other games I like to be the support role. Also, I will have friends to play with but most of the time I'll be solo since  my schedule is weird because of responsibilities.
---
So here are my thoughts....
---
Warrior: I like the class overall, being a tank would get me quick into dungeons but I would be bad in pvp since I don't have time to farm gold for re-spec. Also that I don't have a pockethealer with me.
---
Priest: I really like to heal pve and pvp but outside of dungeons and bgs, I'll have trouble making gold....
---
Rogue: I had a blast to play this class so far. Easy to farm gold with pickpocket and such. Nice to play in pvp but for pve I heard that it's really hard to find a spot since there is too much rogues. I'll also wait hours for dungeons...
---
Shaman: same as priest and I would have love to stay enhance at 60 but nobody will want me.
---
Druid: never played one. This subreddit doesn't like the class much.... No normal Rez :S. Same as priest for farming.
---
Mage: played a little, seems fun but I think I'll get bored. It's sad because you can make easy gold with portals. Desired in dungeons. No need to re-spec for pvp... Etc
---
Warlock: that was my actual level 60 in vanilla and want to try something else.
---
Hunter: that was my first char ever in wow. Leveled to 15 and switch to warlock. Never played another Hunter.
---
I think it would be easy to farm gold but hard to get spots in pve. I don't know anything in term of pvp for this class so idk.... 
---
Please give me your thoughts! Which would fit more to me without having too much cons.... ?
---
Divorved here and soooo happy i have nobody to hold me back on classic!
---
What about for Horde? They'd either have to run through an Alliance zone or Felwood, which is much higher level. Seems against the Vanilla Ome design principles. Just a little criticism, but overall I've loved your work, including this one!
---
It was recently discovered on beta that the melee range increases when you move. For hunter this means the dead zone increases too which is a nerf. Some people argue that this wasn’t vanilla but added in wrath/mop.
---
Those cost money you know.
---
I like the Erebor feel, but im going shaman so i gota go horde. I also dont want to face shamans in pvp
---
Ok so roll on a pve realm which doesn’t cost money. Again, they are not a victim but a willing participant. When you roll on pvp realms you are signing up to get ganked. Getting ganked isn’t harassment, it’s gameplay. You have absolutely no argument left.
---
Literally the best years of my life, classic and BC were a damn trip. It’ll be very different now, but I’m still very excited. I’m also much more efficient with my gaming now than I was back then. I’ll probably end up getting more done in game in much less time.
---
Your face is a tasteless joke tbh
---
ahhh so this nonsensical post really go to OP's intention to promote this A\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* streamer , nice roundabout way to promote this sicko streamer
---
Did it not?  I swear there were marks if AV...  And Warsong Gulch and AB.
---
Believe me. You do NOT want mines at all. They were the most unfun mechanic I have ever experienced in any game.
---
LOL, me an elitist? I spent most of Vanilla playing with a casual raiding guild full of bad players because they were fun to play with.  
---
I'm just being honest with you. More than a few points in prot is shit when it comes to 5 mans. Hell, in raiding even our mostly Fury speced OT was a much more effective tank than our 31 point prot MT when it came to threat.  Prot just isn't very good in Classic.
---
Tauren are going to be a bit more rare this time around. They definitely got the short end of the stick with horde racials, so all the min maxers leave them alone.
---
I feel like when you see a Tauren player, you know they are pretty chill.
---
Oh man, the level 49 death in daoc was so so painful.
---
He's an ass, but he's not wrong. 17/3/31 is not a good tank spec.
---
No, they couldn't hold any type of weapons in the off hand, only "stat stick" type of items.
---
&gt; -no farming rams to buy mounted NPCs you can charge in with
---
I think you can still farm the rams up, just due to the meta that people do it never happens. You'd need stealthies in the enemies' area farming wolves/rams, while you have your own people taming the rams/wolves in your own area.
---
then you'd need to get someone @ a specific high rank (I forget which rank the ram riders took orders from, but it'd be a high officer rank or w/e.)
---
&gt;-no flying NPC guards 
---
pretty sure you could get these too, just again. the meta.
---
&gt;-probably no summoning of the epic Tree and Ice lords.
---
I was browsing some streamers, and a game Xaryu joined late in had the ice lord summoned.
---
Pretty sure one could farm the mines or players and force an upgrade on the guards/wandering guards spawns, but it'd take some pretty solid focused effort. and with how short AV lasts with the way it's played, It's either focused on one or the other with people probably going to be wondering 'why the fuck are you taming rams/wolves???'
---
Any heterogeneous traits you have could produce different combinations so no.
---
TBH the they are the best at: flag running and high level dungeon/elite solo farming (not just DM).
---
You had a pretty nice house in the stock photo, idiot.
---
Ikr? If only we all lived in the same destitute squalor as everyone else.
---
Maraudon will be but Dire Maul won't.
---
Pro Tip: don't have kids and use the money saved from not paying for raising a child on buying gold from chinese gold sellers.
---
Or if you want something more legal there's probably going to be groups who will more than happily trade retail gold for classic and vice versa.
---
Imagine getting a vasectomy lmao.
---
You think you do, but you don’t
---
Idk man. It's just that I asked a question regarding dps and you just comment and say:
---
"ID KICK YOU IF YOU WERE IN MY PARTY", completely uncalled for. 
---
No help whatsoever. I play Tank spec cuz I like Tank spec flavorwise. I'm a casual, I understand it's not the most optimal. I don't need some random guy telling me that "he'd" kick me if he had me. Doesn't add anything to my question and just outright unnecessary. I never asked if my build was viable.
---
Post-naxx content that are more true classic than TBC. TBC wasn't even an MMORPG in my mind.
---
If you or someone you know is missing their sense of humor, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.
---
Call 1-800-THE-LULZ or text ICANTTAKEAJOKE to 741-741
---
A missing sense of humor is kinda your culture, so there's really no hotline for you.
---
why us old farts play pve
---
I remember people adding their guild management experience to their resumes back in the day, because some employers realized that that stuff translated to real world quite well.
---
I wish we had a queue for old AV with NPCs and all the other cool stuff and then the 1.12 AV for farming marks of honor.
---
It was added in 1.4, so 2nd phase I think
---
&gt; everyone blames the tank instead of you
---
I question whether you were actually a raid healer because of this.
---
I mean they must have been trying something to die that many times.
---
I always called her Kirstey Alley with my guildies.
---
Every day has at least one silver lining: you're beating the record of "most days alive" by some kid with cancer.
---
Raiding in Vanilla was hella fun, but not because of the mechanics. The fights were hard and first kills felt huge, and you had a larger raid team so there were enough people to keep a conversation going in chat.
---
Unless you're a ret paladin 😂
---
What went down?
---
Hey man just wanted to say i really enjoy reading your posts on this sub! Thank you for all the effort you put into it. Look forward to the next installment!
---
That’s the thing though. I don’t mind them doing something to keep level 60 people entertained, but over time MMOs become too bloated with too much to do and they add so many new items and raise the cap so many times that nothing seems to have value. 
---
Prime example is FFXIV. When it first launched the level cap was 50 and getting the legendary weapons and iLevel 90 darklight gear was considered the best and a goal to work for. Took hours of grinding and following specific quests. People who did this were idolized and respected for their dedication to the game. However a year or two later and now you can’t even give that crap iLevel 90 gear away because it is handed out like candy. The new level cap is raised and the max gear is like iLevel 227. Everything people work so hard for is crap in just a short while. 
---
I want that feeling when I do get to max level in Classic WoW to feel I earned it. I don’t want to get there and find out some patch released and max level is raised to 90 and that sword I worked so hard for is junk. I don’t want to always be rushing to keep up with end game. I just want to set a goal of making it to level 60 and enjoy the journey knowing it is waiting there for me. If I don’t play full time and don’t make it there in a month like some people do, if it takes me a year or two I want to still see what it is like before a cataclysm or pandas start taking things over.
---
I literally had both bosses summoned a month or so ago. It does still happen, convincing people isn't easy but it's awesome when it happens. I play AV a lot, always have, so I can safely say it's actually more common than it used to be(not counting before Wrath), but that's not saying much
---
Obviously mileage may vary, I just find all the AV nostalgia posts funny when they're still accurate to Retail, where's muh pre terrain changes nostalgia
---
I understand that, I never denied that. Not everyone has to minmax though.
---
Absolutely. I’ve changed my perspective on sharting significantly as well
---
y?  tbc &gt; vanilla.
---
class rotation 
---
specs
---
raids
---
Got an actual LOL out of me.
---
Thanks, I mostly worked on the content but not the progression, I will need to work on it a lot to come with something solid a real progression plan. I should start making some graphs
---
These 'has gear similar to bwl" and stuff  were pretty random I didn't think much about it, I just did 0.5 tier up for each new raid
---
I don't have much to add aside from the fact that, maybe it was hard because we were bad, sure. That is fine, but still...give us the old version because it has the potential to be more fun.
---
Why do we have to be dads for this? I've been thinking about getting this done for a while precisely so that I never will be a father.
---
Why does it matter if it is old or new AV then ? If it is in regards to honor grind then WSG or AB is still better. If it is in regards to fun then there is No clear winner. A few months ago the sub seemed to favour the old AV.
---
The terrible music made it feel like a true Vanilla pvp video.
---
Using your talents wisely isn't min/maxing.
---
The Druid gear is the absolute best of all the casters, actually (for a casting Druid). It has the most +sp which is actually all that even matters. Shamans only have +29 sp and have no viable 2hr.
---
I already did mine... for a switch...
---
&gt; And yes you come off as a very self centered guy when you'd kick a guy just for his build.
---
I'd kick him because I don't want to spend 2x as much time in a dungeon as necessary and having a tank that can't hold aggro just leads to a miserable run.  You can get by with shitty healers, shitty DPSers, but if your tank can't generate enough rage to get aggro, things are going suck donkey balls.  I don't mind poorly geared tanks, or lazy tanks, but tanks that can't hold aggro just don't make the runs worth it.
---
I was good friends with the MT in my guild and he absolutely hated to tank 5 mans because he was close to useless as a 31 point prot tank in them while I breezed through them in tanking in my poorly geared arms warrior.
---
Sure. "you think you do, but you don't." 
---
Layering is lazy. They couldn't figure out a better idea so they went with layering, clustering, phasing and instancing.
---
All these forms of lazy development try to just tackle things that are not CORE Massively Multiplayer Role Playing Game ideas..
---
Guild Wars for instance was one of the first to just completely get away with this.. For some types of people they are a kind of ignorant where this stuff just doesn't matter. But if you are not ignorant it completely destroys the core purpose. 
---
This zone you are in, is not unique, it is just a copy of a copy of a copy.
---
There are solutions.. People should just live with Lower population servers.. But that seems like something no one seems to handle and because they are a certain type of blissful ignorant so they can just deal. 
---
It's just so lazy.. Like saying, "You just woudn't understand.. you aren't in the room.." What a convenient cop out.
---
Sorry when I wrote this part:
---
"And yes you come off as a very self centered guy when you'd kick a guy just for his build."
---
I noticed it came off as unreasonable, I changed it like 5 seconds after I wrote that.
---
That's the spirit!
---
I think it might be in phase 1
---
Nah, it’s not wimpy...like most of vanilla, it’s more about time investment than actual skill. I leveled to 60 on both a PvP server and PvE server in vanilla and enjoyed the PvP server until all three BGs were up and rolling, then only the dregs were left out in world PvP at max level. I’m going to level however far I can on a PvP server this time around until phase 2, just for the nostalgia. At that   point I’ll start over on a PvE server since really, I don’t have time to add extra pointless “level 60 ganks me” PvP to my leveling experience. 
---
It’s a game. Play it how you want. If anyone judges you for it, it says much more about them than it does you.
---
Haven't played since WotLK over here. Are there really no more PvP servers? Like, what do you even do in retail...?
---
isn't there a PVE beta and a PVP beta? why does a girl like that play on the PVP server if she cannot stand the gang fucking with her shit? I don't get it.
---
Majordomo didn't drop any loot before 1.4. I seriously doubt Blizzard is planning that.
---
Blizzard is not all knowing. 
---
It's great that they put a lot of thought in to what they're doing - but thought doesn't guarantee the decision is correct. Look at retail. A series of bad decisions in their part is why people have been begging for classic for years.
---
~~Thousand~~Three Needles
---
What an encouraging post, but no wrath at all? I'm determined to level as boomy even if it kills me.
---
Maybe min/max wasn't the best word. Maybe "optimal" would've been better. Regardless, I'd like to play what I think is fun (even if it means going against the optimal build).
---
The reason this occurs is because **the private server community is inherently different from the Classic community.**
---
The private server community focuses so much on min-maxing it's insane. It's not surprising that the guilds would rig the system to give them as many rewards as possible so that they can get their Unstoppable Force and get out.
---
This will not be the case in Classic because the communities and their mindsets will differ so much. There will be far more casual players and far less hardcore min-maxers. As much as I hate cross-realm BGs, they will prevent premades from taking advantage of the systems and cooperating cross-faction in AV.
---
Will some players figure out how to zerg it? Maybe. But 1.12 AV is definitively worse than 1.5 AV, no matter how you spin it, because AV isn't meant to be a zergfest for honor rewards. It's supposed to be a zone, where people who'd prefer to PvE can still contribute to the war effort by farming mobs, where people can give resources to make and buff troops so that everyone can push as one army.
---
Saying that they should go with 1.12 AV which discourages all of this simply because "oh people would zerg it anyway, the solution is clearly to make zerging it even easier" is outright idiotic and foolish.
---
He’s a Trump fan right?
---
Won't happen cuz it involves development cost.   Also, it would fuck up all the itemization post vanilla.  ALL of it.  This would also cost development $.
---
They want ppl playing retail, buying xpacs, buying pets, buying mounts, race changes, etc...  The truth of the matter is that classic is just a desperate attempt to get more people into playing bfa and future xpacs.
---
We will be super lucky just to get tbc classic.
---
I'm out of the loop!
---
Just keep an eye out for tomorrow’s “Reddit is toxic” post. It’ll give OP a run for their money
---
Amazing article! Had a 4.0 my first 2 semesters in college doing double majors. Beginning of 3rd semester made a cow war on tich along side my buddy's lock and anothers priest. Gpa went below 2 for that semester, gained 30 lbs and almost failed out the 4th semester. But you know what? I got 15/15 and a rank 14 so hell yeah it was worth it! LOL.
---
PvP is a huge reason the **active classic community** wants Classic WoW. But the active classic community is only a couple of tens of thousands, maybe a hundred thousand at most. And not even all of those are that into PvP. For mostly everyone else it's a fun side-activity. 
---
Will the BGs keep people interested for months ? Maybe... For years ? Not a chance. The sad truth is that if you want to play them efficiently they're boring as fuck, and if you want to have fun then most of the time the other team is just ignores you and steam-rolls the win. 
---
The BGs were great when they came out 'cuz people didn't know how to play them and they just wanted to fight, but that's not how anyone plays them anymore. And as far as phase 2 pvp goes.. it's pretty much the same as normally playing on a pvp server, except maybe turned up 10-20%. It's gonna be an all out brawl the first days/week, but it'll die down fast as people want to move on to more productive activities.
---
Alternatively, use the LFG addon that will be available at launch.
---
One of the few things wrong with vanilla is it attracts people like you
---
Pure cringe
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
&gt;this fella is trying to prevent someone from choosing/expecting something unrealistic.
---
Expecting something unrealistic would be for someone to expect others to expect the same thing as they do simply because they expect it.
---
It's 2019. All races are accepted. 
---
OTrUTaHGD+.
---
I was so mad that blizz didn't mention Stress Testers would get in on AV testing.... Then I realized I still didn't have access. Lol rip
---
You could always have seasonal servers that rotate content yearly, so that players would be required to farm new gear like how they would in the expansions.
---
Without a seasonal reset system, well the hope is that different gear sets from new raids would allow for new talent builds and playstyles. Perhaps the gear set bonuses could facilitate that. Mounts, tradeskill recipes, gear cosmetics, and other collectables might be enough of an incentive.
---
Yeah, I also saw the idea floating around for a pop up in your loot history when you spend "X" amount of time in AV that awards you a mark of honor. This way each AV can take any amount of time to finish a full session and still everyone get's what they wanted.  
---
If you want a item that costs marks of honor no problem, you do your "Y" amount of time and you get it, if you want to stay in the full NPC week long AV battle for the sake of the battle, well you can do that too!
---
I was going to upvote but then I read “beloved dungeons” and “Uldaman” in the same sentence.
---
I'm still hoping they'll change their minds on this one. Old AV is iconic to vanilla.
---
When I was 14 and deep into vanilla wow I was getting blowjobs under my desk by a girl obsessed with me and would come over just to give me a bj while I ground out AVs.
---
That want even my girlfriend, who I frequently engaged in threesomes with her hot Asian best friend that she wanted me to help because get parents had her sexually repressed.
---
I had tons of friends, on track to be very successful, and played wow 8 hours a day.
---
Now I effectively live in a box, I pay for sex cuz I've let myself go, and my life is very likely to not go anywhere before I finally succumb to heart disease.
---
Can't be much help on your question, but if it turns out cats are better than raptors, there's a sweet ass black lion rare spawn in barrens. I don't remember the name but he does look cool!
---
10g/hr is probably more realistic, but you're also getting XP from killing. It seems like the best route is just continuing to level without a mount if you can't afford one yet
---
Grind
---
This has been "Fishing for Downvotes" by BeethovenTheMage.
---
Gotta grind mane
---
Also while you’re grinding aim for board for cooking or troggs for first aid.  Make your grind mean something. Always.  And you’ll never waste a minute
---
What am I looking at.
---
Think of it as chromie making an alternative timeline. 
---
If they create TBC i hope they rewrite the story. Have the illidari and KT blood elves even being a quest giving faction.
---
NPC faction rivalry like they had for aldor and scryers, but bigger scale. 
---
Good writing that totally didnt crap all over the character development of WC3. .
---
Exactly. So many posters on this subreddit are in denial about how stale WSG/AB can be, let alone all the exploiting/wintrade/dodging that will be happening by premade. Getting matched against premades and being rolled over in 5 minutes is a disasterous for WoW.
---
You can still do those things now.. just sayin.
---
Is wyvern sting a fear/charm in vanilla? I don't think you can WotF out of it.

---
&gt; No the bullying is ganking lowbies. Where’s the sport in that? You like stepping on puppies or hitting toddlers?
---
Some people do it just to make you miserable, want to log out and go to a PvE server.
---
Some people do it so you'll call friends/guildies/others for a big ol' pvp brawl.
---
Thanks!! That's very helpful. BTW, I'm just wondering if I go to Human zone, will I be able to get the Hunter level 10 quest there as a Dwarf Hunter? (Do I have to go back to my original zone for it because of the race)
---
This is  too far, nobody would want that people want to keep it simple with  new content that doesn't hurt the base game too much imo.
---
Orc isn't troll.
---
Helped me get my Head chef position a while back, can't remember how the conversation got onto it but turned out that the owner was in one of the best Halo teams in Aus and understood the leadership skills in raid leading a very high end raiding guild.

They don't give a shit anymore. Just removing any random post that's picked.

This guy is already one step ahead
---
For leveling omen of clarity is key for keeping it efficient, so you really have to just play around it.  Usually I use moonfire with it or rejuvenate/regrowth if needed.  You can slip in wraths with omen procs or if you have mana to spend.  The goal is to reduce drinking to a minimum.
---
you could maybe try looking into an inversion table. not sure if itll help with your specific problem but it might be worth a check.
---
1.12 AV is not fun.
---
it never was, and it won't be.
---
the older versions of AV are a lot more interesting and they should really put that in the game for that spicy vanilla experience that we all want.
---
1.12 was a horrible time for battlegrounds. it was just crossrealm AV faceroll. recreating that is monumentally stupid.
---
I've ranked several times, I love WSG but I'm usually burned out by like R11, and then just push through the rest. by time I hit 13 or 14 I'm so sick of bg I won't step foot in another one for a year, except for the occasional wsg prem vs prem (the interest for these dies out fast). Wpvp is fun for me, so I just do that. You couldn't pay me to play AB outside of ranking and 1.12 AV is basically PvE.
---
anyways if you ask me the hardcore pvp community is gonna be dead on arrival. The really hardcore players will be done ranking in P2 or very near, so you will get weaker premades in P3, with crossrealm and 1.12 Alterac Valley rankers may not even play WSG specially if WSG has a premade queue. There will be a very small amount of players interested in prem vs prem WSG with no rewards, extremely small to nonexistent since they have to farm consumables to participate.
---
There are, but they are opt-in with you toggling it on in Stormwind or Orgrimmar and being sent to a PvP shard and you can toggle it off in rested areas.  
---
It's a compromise between not spotting a juicy noob out in the world and toggling PvP on just to get them and also not being camped as you just try to get your mythic + group together.

I think Tauren are actually sleepers in pvp. Their increases range is mega huge and not accounted for on private servers. The amount of times you get off an additional hit while people are trying to get out of range is inumerable and, war stomp is the shit.

Pservers aren’t a good measure. They’re getting shut down in 2 months and have 4x the population under one roof.
---
\&gt; I take this as a "game" analysis and not an actual lore analysis. Obviously just because the Defias have more territory than Stormwind does in game, doesn't mean it will or should be that way in the lore. Things will absolutely not be the same at all. 
---
I mean this is probably the right mind set, and i dont disagree with anything you've said. Most of this videos is an extrapolation of what we see in game and as such it really shouldn't be taken overly seriously. Its just for fun. The lore is simply not in-depth enough to say anything definitive and so i have to rely on the in-game world. Which honestly for most people i'd think is far more engaging and entertaining anyway for this kind of thing, as opposed to referencing literature a tiny minority are even familiar with.

That place is absolutely breathtaking and I can see where they got their inspiration from.
---
Pictures like that make me realize that there are still a lot of lands that are untouched by human hand, or at least it pretty much looks like it.
---
We talking supply, or demand?  Because demand is going to be Warriors and Mages, but supply of both classes will be high.  I suggest Warlock or Hunter if you want a class that tends to be under supplied in raids.
---
Yeah unless you’re really trying to minmax it doesn’t matter, play what you want.
---
I'm just happy I won't have to worry about real life anymore now that I'll have a way more fulfilling life to live
---
Im out of the loop. 
---
Is Asmongold banned? Did he get someone else banned?
---
mc would never be irrelevant as long as tf is op.  mc will be done ad infinitum at 60.
---
Yeah I was thinking hunter I know you want 3 for tranqs
---
Superb.
---
Same, it all sounds so over the top and fake.
---
Did this mount give 60% or 100% move speed? I’d be hesitant to do the grind if it was gonna be slower mount than the ones at lvl 60.
---
In my opinion, yes. Finding a spot will definitely be harder than most other classes because you don’t need very many. That being said, if you are a skilled hunter and outperform the mass amount of hunters you’ll have an easier time.
---
I’m not sure I’ll be able to perform as well due to wrist issues so I’m beginning to think Hunter will be my alt.
---
I read that a year ago and, while John is a great guy, I find this section of his book very distasteful. 
---
While the public is not clued in to the nuances of the planning sessions, he implies, whether intentionally or mistakenly, that we are therefore not qualified to analyze systems in the game. I disagree with this. We at the mercy of those systems. We're more qualified than anybody to judge their merits from a player's perspective since we're the ones who will try to immerse into the game world. 
---
In this case many of us have real world precedent from retail WoW, SWTOR, ESO, and other MMORPGs. We *know* how bad layering will turn out because we know what it feels like to deal with a system where players arbitrarily exist or do not exist to us in a game world. I don't have to have been at a Blizzard meeting to be qualified to say that items and people phasing in and out of existence is a bad thing. That not seeing the same people I grouped with yesterday even though we're both logged in and in the same place is absurd in the recreation of Vanilla.
---
aye this is perfect ty, gonna use for my guild.
---
Enhancement is still pretty viable in endgame pvp if you can get decent gear. It's kind of similar to balance druid in the sense that gearing for enhancement can be difficult. You'll probably see a lot of enhancement shamans wearing some armor pieces meant for rogues, whether that is actually worth it to wear those leather pieces is up for debate. In raiding there is no real reason to have enhancement shamans over other classes other than their improved weapon totems talent and grouping them with melee dps for strong WF totems. Classic raiding is relatively easy though, so unless you're in a hardcore guild that really wants to min-max, it probably won't be as restrictive as back in the day when everyone was a scrub.
---
Personally I think elemental is more fun in pvp most of the time because it's less RNG and has some of the best reliable burst damage in the game, and you're probably gonna have more Mana to work with. Casting spells feels more interactive than auto attacking with your fingers crossed mixed in with the occasional stormstrike (long cooldown high Mana cost) and rank 1 frost/earth shock. You gotta save Mana healing yourself as well as for certain totems as enhancement. While getting the triple crit windfury proc feels amazing, getting no windfury procs in 8 swings feels pretty bad man. 
---
You still get the occasional opportunity to auto attack as elemental, but it's probably gonna be with a caster dagger with flametongue or frostbrand. 
---
I'm still gonna try to spec enhancement at first, myself, but I know I'll get over it and Respec after a month or so of endgame content
---
Times change
---
Gearing for a hunter is very easy due to low numbers.  Downside is your DPS starts sucking in AQ40.  It's fun in MC, Ony, and BWL though.
---
&gt; The reason this occurs is because the private server community is inherently different from the Classic community.
---
The private server community is a reflection of the most enthusiastic Classic WoW players. The enthusiastic players from retail will behave *just like* the private server players. 
---
&gt; There will be far more casual players and far less hardcore min-maxers.
---
The casuals will *always* follow what the enthusiastic players are doing, unless they purposefully make and join casual-oriented premade groups.
---
Casuals will always defer to enthusiastic players.
---
&gt; AV isn't meant to be a zergfest for honor rewards.
---
Like I said: The only reason you believe this is because you haven't acknowledged that players are all, across the board, different from back then. Back then people didn't know how to play well. Now they do. You'd have to replace people's brains in order to get AV to “work” the way you think it should, no matter the patch.
---
My best guess is OP is a sperg that probably got banned from Asmons chat.
---
And then we doubled it
---
I agree that the reason they aren't giving us old AV is because they don't want to put the work in. Which I can understand but it still sucks that they're giving us a shittier version of the game than pservers, even if it is more accurate when it comes to number.
---
I think you will be able to find a raid spot as any dps (except shaman etc). as for most in demand on Horde private servers its  fury warrior followed by rogue (stack melee). my guild recruited new players on every class at some point. On Alliance I'm not really sure, maybe warlock or the 1 spriest spot which no one wants to play.
---
private servers have a much higher concentration of warrior players than Classic is going to have, so it will be fury by a mile IF they don't have too severe threat issues which they may. that would make rogue the superior dps but a lot of noobs are gonna roll rogue so idk.
---
it's more about putting effort in your class, consumes, playing well, raid attendance. 40 man guilds are always recruiting.
---
Stop it. Get some help.
---
You’ll have to go back to your starting zone because there isn’t a hunter trainer in the human starter zone to my knowledge

Wait till you hear about what they get up to when the servers are offline.

that's the bay of baradin, not this area

First time I have seen the onion not get it.
---
Love me some onion
---
Why dont you make maps of the new dungeons and raids in these zones?
---
Yep. Makes you wonder why they capped everyone at 58 and how shitty the BG is going to be at 60.
---
Probably Warlock. Its a pretty underplayed class, especially on the Alliance. It doesn't top the charts like Mage, and PvP is a bit more complicated, and WoTF is a thing, so Warlocks tend to have a shorter supply.
---
Hey guys. Just reminiscing about some times I had with my first ever warrior alt from back in the day. What stories do you all have? :)
---
I haven't played since mid wrath, I had just figured mod authors by this point had all kinds of neat little stuff created.
---
I cantt say I'm looking for anything like the autopilot mod, more just smaller quality of life type stuff. UI enhancement, hotbars, cool down numbers overs skills, maybe a bag manager, DPS/threat meters, maybe some other nifty things.
---
I'll probably be rolling warrior again, outside of swing timer are there any other major ones? Maybe some sort of item set mod to quickly switch between gear?
---
Several of those seem pretty neat, I'll definitely be checking them out.
---
Lawl get wrecked streamer thot

I don't really care if my DPS sucks as long as it's the class and not me playing wrong as long as hunters are still required which they are for tranq shot then I'm fine playing that. I may play hunter I have 2 months to flip flop
---
If you're only level 9 and you've done all the quests, then I would suggest on release to grind more mobs as you travel. In general if your moving towards a quest location or turn in, you should be kill the mobs on your way there.
---
In your current situation I'd either grind more mobs on my way to the Loch Modan FP.
---
"High-end Horde communities" that's important. 
---
Horde have more high-end players, no argument there. 
---
More PvPers gravitate towards horde, no doubt there. That's not the point.
---
High-end players, (as in tryhards, world firsts, rank 14s etc etc) are the vast minority of the player base. The majority of the players aren't hardcore min maxers.
---
The AVERAGE Alliance raids have an advantage over the average Horde in PVE progression due to Blessing of Salvation, not the racials. It's easier for Pugs and Casual guilds to progress as Alliance vs Horde in PvE.
---
This leads to more Alliance players having better gear than the same amount of players playing Horde on average. 
---
More Horde players are PvP oriented than those on Alliance, because like you said the Horde naturally gravitates them.
---
However even casuals and PvE oriented players engage in PvP and as you've stated more casuals flock to alliance. So EXCLUDING the minority of players who are tryhards and dedicated PvPers with Marshal/Warlord gear the majority are just average Joe's who dabble in both and won't see Rank 14 or Naxx ever.
---
When you look at that majority you will see that the Alliance have better gear than the Horde on average in a PvP setting simply because it's easier for people to progress on Alliance due to Blessing of Salvation.
---
So you end up with a strange balance because of it all. More deviated PVPers on Horde or the Casual Alliance get a slight gear advantage from more casuals being able to succeed in raids.
---
No it's true. 
---
Sounds stupid to people that dont understand what it took but like explaining 4 horseman to my guild at the time. I was only like 16 17 at the time. 
---
First I had to study the fight myself, every single class role, then prepare my presentation of sorts to grown ass adults. So I couldn't like talk for 20 30 minutes. It had to be fast and extremely confident and clear. Making sure all 40 people knew their jobs. 
---
That right there was more experience leading teams of diverse individuals then any college class or internship. 
---
Then it's like dealing with different personalities and working with them while still having fun. Learning those communication skills. Helping people realize their own talents and limitations. 
---
Also dealing with loot back then, was like dealing with compensation disputes at a real company. I had more experience dealing with compensation disputes by age 18 then most project managers at my own company. 
---
All that aside though, the article is playing on some truths from classic.
---
But, all the guys from that raid guild, are still my friends today. We dont hang out in person, but they're more my friends then a lot of my real life friends. 
---
Classic does that to people.
---
I love reading theory crafting and fan fiction content like this. So many ideas that all make sense to classic wow thematically. Great work!
---
Don't get bogged down with all the negativity of "no changes" and "BC is the only post-Nax content". They will likely re-release BC when classic proves to be a success but why not have classic+ as well. Its fun to think about and discuss. 
---
As for the actual content you've offered. I really like the scarlet crusade idea, its not something that I've seen before. Also the fact that you've based so many of the patches of unfinished and proposed updates from the original game is a nice touch. 
---
On the subject of gearing and power creep, I read a couple of the comments and a lot of them seem to focus on gear as the only really people do any content. Yes its a nice carrot to encourage people to participate but I think the popularity of classic has proven that people are engaged even when rewards aren't constantly shoved in their faces. 
---
You can have gear dropping that are equivalent in power level but have different bonuses that encourage different play styles or simply gear that looks different that functions the same. New raids don't necessarily need to drop 'upgrades' they can be side-grades (for lack of a better word)
---
Anyways that's my two-cents...
---
Efficient leveling spreadsheets?
---
\*May the eternal sun shine upon thee\*
---
Physical gear requiring marks was a TBC feature. In vanilla the marks were only used as turn-ins for honor.
---
\-May the eternal sun shine upon thee-

**Uther:** I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you sold your soul and became a death knight in order to kill mal'ganis, Is that correct?
---
**Arthas:** (pauses for a few seconds) Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you, I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon, you know, ‘cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you people do that all the time.

---
&gt; When you look at that majority you will see that the Alliance have better gear than the Horde on average in a PvP setting simply because it's easier for people to progress on Alliance due to Blessing of Salvation.
---
You're not talking about casuals there. The people who care about the particular gear itemization for progression are not average players.
---
I still don't get how you're arguing that players *prefer* realms where their faction is the minority.
---
&gt; The vast majority would be quick to go for the faction that's Underrepresented on a server.
---
Then you make these long essays about how realms are naturally unbalanced because gear and spells, therefore completely contradicting yourself. Just take the L, my dude.
---
I’m not too sure about dollars dude, but if you’re willing to commit to setting some money aside each week there’s no reason you won’t be able to save up for a decent pc, make some sacrifices here and there and you’ll have one in no time :)
---
Another option would be finance, depending on your age and credit history etc. I’m not sure about where you’re from, but over here pc world do monthly finance on a lot of things
---
Like it's hard to be an attention whore lol
---
this guy had some insider knowledge way before the rest of us. Tell us what you know, /u/murderthumbz!
---
&gt; Anyway people who are against "power creep" because it invalidates older content are pretty much against any new content unless it is completely irrelevent
---
Consider horizontal progression. 
---
Players would be able to do the next expansion content in Tier 1, 2, or 3 gear from Vanilla because that would never get more powerful. Instead, they would develop abilities to exploit the enemies in the new zone(s): perhaps by recognizing vulnerabilities (a new stat similar to +spell damage that affects these mobs) and by gaining specific types of resistances that allow the player to take on higher-difficulty enemies. 
---
Eventually, when they are well acclimated to the enemies in this place, they can work their way into dungeons that have some major upgrades and function as barriers for raids that require extensive dungeon farming. This functions as an immersive technique, as players would feel that they have begun to master combat with these enemies and are ready to face the big bads. 
---
Upgrades would come in the form of imbuements to gear, be it a compounding enchantment, adding item slots to your gear and then upgrading the inserts, or something reminiscient of the artifact gear from Legion/neck piece from BfA. 
---
Imagine Northrend without the gear treadmill. When you get there you'd only be able to deal with the early mobs whose "necro", "freeze", "titan", and other traits do not overwhelm you and do not protect them from your untrained character. You'd die immediately if you went next to ICC because the mobs there, while similar in life pools to you and to their colleagues in the first zone, would be incredibly adept with these powers and you would yet be able to survive a battle with them.
---
I will agree I might have a crossbow instead.
---
To be fair stormwind wanted to pay them for rebuilding, however *cough*onyxia*cough* I mean lady prestor convinced them not to pay them. Something is fishy about her I swear.

Frostbolt
---
As I tell my non-gaming friends who don't understand "time enjoyed wasting is not wasted time".
---
Or maybe it's a really good guild that knows you don't really need to min/max all the time to make it in vanilla wow
---
Don't complain about business opportunities.

I'm talking more like fights where I will be mass decursing, movement I should be aware of in advance, knowing I'll get a bomb casted on me potentially in advance, etc.

Sometimes I read posts like these and realize that the people who post on this sub either have never worked a day job in their life or are teenagers.

Like... *fucking duh.*

F that. Losing toughers/skills and all your gear in Meridian 59 was the worst. PVP server was so toxic for new players...
---
Wtf is that shitty ass clickbait gtfo
---
Same thing, but there are some cats with faster attack speeds than other cats and raptors.
---
Windfury procs in AV.
---
That was why. 
---
No regrets.
---
&gt; We're more qualified than anybody to judge their merits from a player's perspective because we're the ones who will try to immerse into the game world.
---
Sure, but you still haven't made the jump from problem-finding to solution-providing.
---
Like the great Mark Rosewater said:
---
&gt; Your audience is good at recognizing problems and bad at solving them.
---
&gt; What does a doctor always do first? They ask you how you're feeling. Why? Because you're the expert on you. No one else better understands how you feel. However, the doctor doesn't often ask you how to solve any problems that you might have because they're better equipped than you to do that. The same is true in game design.
---
&gt; Your players have a better understanding of how they feel about your game than you do. They can tell easier when something is wrong and they're excellent at identifying problems, but they're not as equipped to solve the problems. They don't know the restrictions you're under or what needs you have to fulfill. They see the game from their perspective, but your job is to understand the perspective of all the players. So use your audience as a resource to help figure out what is wrong with your game, but take it with a grain of salt when they offer you solutions.
---
Or a really good guild that wants a totem-weaving shaman in their rogue/warrior power group. 
---
Shit is powerful.
---
I know the reasons activision does ANYTHING. Shareholders. Activision isn’t in the business of making games, they are in the business of making money, and game devs are just a tool to do so. 
---
This excerpt also highlights the problems with secretive production. It’s why I’m glad Star Citizen is so open about what they are doing. If they are doing something, we know exactly why and the community has time and avenues to express their concerns with enough information to do so meaningfully. 
---
With actibliz it’s like shouting into a dark room about rumors you’ve heard and just hoping somebody was in there to hear. BFA beta was riddled with issues from class design to progression/gearing and nothing was fixed. Instead it was rushed to release, and then players were told that classes weren’t going to be rebalanced mid xpac and to wait for 9.0. What a kick in the balls.
---
Yea sure, that worked out well for half the damn expansions
---
If you play with tryhards/knowledgeable players and learn how to totem-weave (and know how to PvE Enh) then you'll be in every raid. 
---
Your group will be the top dps warrior/rogues + you.
---
Awesome post. I actually wish this was all integrated. 🙏🏼
---
There are several schools of thought on what the best raiding pet is. Personally, I think a wolf is ideal, as Furious Howl rank 4 is a great buff for melee in your group and you can just park the wolf out of range of enemy cleaves and still be buffing allies in fights where sending your pet in would just mean a dead pet.

But that's not the point.
---
The point is that all the layering post can gtfo because people know less than a tiny fraction of what goes on, so stop speculation based on litterally nothing.
---
Skinning/leather for devilsaur set pre-BiS, after I get enough ony scales for my raid group I plan on switching to mining/engineering.
---
At the end of the day those grenades and chickens' siren song is too strong to resist.
---
Honestly unless you're trying to be in a guild striving for firsts or crazy min/max progression focused I'd suggest play what you want, but make sure you get really good at it. Fantastic players can usually find a good raid spot no matter the class. 
---
Spend the time to learn your rotation, learn how to gear properly, research the fights beforehand, come with plenty of consumables, if you're wanting to go that extra mile bring extras for others and volunteer to help out with random things often.
---
I know it's not really a direct answer to your questions, but player skill and willingness to work on always improving really do go a long way.
---
Goddamn that trailer still holds up.
---
Nice, I am looking forward to hearing about your findings :)
---
War stomp is an extra tool to make use of, and the orc/troll bonuses aren't THAT significant.
---
The only thing is, when I go a day without caffeine I feel like I'm dying. So there's that.
---
bummer :(
---
I wrote an army rotc essay about my leadership in WoW. I can only hope today I was as succinct in it as you were. I got the scholarship too. Leading mc raids and 5s arena were a great way to build leadership.
---
Why do you not train dash? I thought getting your pet to the mob ASAP is key to get DPS in and build threat.
---
The thing that most current players fail to understand is that WOW back then was grindy as hell.   But it was also REWARDING.  When you had a goal to grind rep for a weapon for example.  The reward was well worth the time you put in to get it.  And it was a sense of accomplishment.  When you raided, it was the same principle.  You received better gear.  You made friends and contact everywhere that sometimes has lasted over a decade on line.  But now with the LFG system and LFR raiding, who cares about the guy who fails at healling.  Fuck that guy.  While in Vanilla you spent time figuring out and helping those people out.  You learn that guy who had problem healing was a vet playing with 1 hand and was playing to relax.   Or the stay at home mom who was using it to unwind during the day.   The point is that wow is so impersonal now.  While back in the past it forced you to interact with people and while there were annoying aspects, it was part of its charm.
---
From your description it does sound like you are fairly new to WoW and not experienced in PvP. You jumped on an instant 60 priv PvP server and got curb stomped. You have to realized that the populations of said servers are very tryhard veterans. You were the sheep among wolves.
---
You recognize your short comings in PvP and want to improve. That says something about your trajectory. You will not be in the gutter forever. Eventuelly rise up as a PvP god.
---
Bit to get there, the trick is to learn your class in portions. Some new abilities now and then, occational world PvP/BGs here and there. 
---
For the love of god, stay away from the dumpster fire that retail is and enjoy Classic!
---
Idd. It's on the same level as wearing sandals with socks.
---
Good, a reminder, had almost forgot in the 27 minutes since the last post about this.
---
Yes it is hard. If you're ready to show up with full consumes and buffs though then you'll be fine, but be ready for strong competition. It's almost ironic that a weak dps class has the people who often care the most about maximising dps.
---
Ghost Wolf and Windfury alone are enough to play Shaman.
---
Do it.
---
I'm not talking about players that optimize for progression.
---
I AM talking about the majority of players and casuals on Alliance who raid and end up having a Paladin in their raid using blessing of Salvation. You're failing to see the point that BoS isn't something a single player needs to optimize for, it's just there in a raid, all players on Alliance gain the advantage of it in terms of PvE Progression.
---
I actually said they end up strangely balanced due to it. I fail to see the contradiction and suspect you didn't read my "essay" since you can't even keep up.
---
Casual/Majority of players roll on the faction they want not based on racials or advantages in either PvE or PvP, they just chose.
---
Those who pick the optimal class or the optimal faction on a server are the minority, we agree on this. 
---
However, on the original topic, I believe there's just as many people who pick the Underdogs as there are who pick the OP faction on a server because there are significant advantages to both and different players capitalize on those advantages in their own different ways to succeed. 
---
So like I said, until I see the statistics you claimed originally, I don't think everyone just defaults to want to go on the OP faction.
---
Love your ideas. Thanks for taking the time to make this.
---
I thought about doing it like this, to be honest with you. But it's not as efficient as you might think. Bear form is quite a lot weaker at level 10 than in Pservers. Going to Camp T at level 6/7 is not faster than doing it at level 10 and collecting the Alpha Wolf Teeth and Cougar claws for the Hunters Way near the border of the Barrens (dont have to complete these quests right away). Go to Camp T, run back to the wolves, complete the wolf quest and go into the mine for the venture Co kill quest + Clipboard quest. Die inside the mine for a quick respawn in Bloodhoof and continue from there. In my experience (got 9 druids at level 14 in Beta now) this is faster and more efficient in the long run.
---
Hope this helps!
---
I'll just be doing skinning for devilsaur. Endgame I think Herb/Alch or Mining/Engi are best options, mainly dependant on if solo trib is a thing.
---
Chain Heal is easily the coolest heal in the game. It's so fucking pretty and it feels great to cast one spell and help most of your party / the raid members who are all standing in fire.
---
Chain Lightning. Chain Heal. Ghost Wolf. 
---
Shaman has some of the coolest spells in the game.
---
Won't the fights be the same as before, could you just look up old guides?
---
Hell yeah, you ever come across CryHavoc on bone-chewer?
---
Totem-weaving in MC to boost the fuck outta that melee group's already scary DPS. Hell yeah.  
---
Respect.
---
Pvp is an easy yes. Doing pugs as a hunter is rough as guts - try joining a casual raiding guild instead.
---
Damn thanks alot for the silver, never got that before! :)
---
Well it's not an argument it's just my opinion. Im sure dps and healing is more than just watching colored bars go up and down, I was just being a little hyperbolic.
---
That being said, people have found alternate ways to get into Hyjal, Caverns of Time, Under Stormwind in Classic Beta.
---
"they are not a victim but a willing participant"
---
You're literally suggesting that in order to not be harassed they should either make less money or change how they're playing. This is very clear victim blaming."lol if you don't want to get corpse camped just play on a different server, if your job is streaming you should expect to have a shit experience and be harassed". This isn't "normal" pvp, the problem is people using it to harass.
---
"lol if you don't want papparazi just don't go outside ??? just stop being an actor and people won't harrass you???"
---
&gt;Azshara zone is updated, tons of new quests for both leveling and &gt;end game.
---
No. Added content must not change or delete older content, or we will be soon asking for classic again.
---
&gt; What if players received a big honor reward for every 30 minutes they were active in old AV? 
---
This fits well with the lore of PvP in WoW because, when you think about it, the honor ranking system is really about how dedicated you are to your faction. You don't get rank 14 by being the best; you get rank 14 by being one of the most committed champions of the Horde/Alliance. It would be perfectly acceptable to me to be rewarded for time spent in AV or, since it used to function kind of like a meat grinder, bigger honor rewards for kills in that particular BG.
---
lol. I camped that motherfucker forever back in the day to get him... spawns just north of Ratchet iirc
---
You should always be killing something while levelling.
---
This world needs more people like you. I mean that totally unrelated to WoW.
---
Oh shit I remember you Hycran. Not sure if youll remember me i was in CT (and then MB) an orc shaman named Necrophagist. Angwe was a true hero and the Dethecus wow forums were unrivaled in terms of trolling and austism.
---
 and yar, I be one
---
Thanks mate
---
wtf
---
how did I play how for like 5 years and never know this.
---
1. Conjure many waters before raid starts. A few classes might want some biscuits 
---
2. Frostbolt until AQ40
---
3. Scorch/Fireball in AQ40
---
4. Summon portal at end of instance
---
5. Do it all again next week
---
This
---
To me, it makes sense in one context: giving content to the top ~1% of your playerbase that would otherwise be too small to target with any meaningful amount of content. With how accessible resources are via the internet now, the people that research and practice in a game are so far ahead of the people that don't that any content tuned to be appropriately difficult to these players will absolutely crush everyone else into the ground.
---
Having a "hard mode" basically allows developers to continuously create new content for this group of players without having to go through a full development cycle every patch for the top couple percent of the playerbase. By contrast, classic raids will likely all be quite easy for hardcore / good semi-hardcore guilds all the way until late AQ40, meaning that these guilds won't have a challenging progression experience until over a year into classic.
---
I have no idea why you were downvoted. Y'all need to read how to use the updoot downdoot system.

Frankly, layering as a concept is the perfect solution to the launch concerns that Blizzard has. Anyone who doesn’t understand that is kidding themselves. No one wants to take 30 minutes trying to tag 8 boars at level 1, and no one wants to end up on a server that’s dead in 4 months. 
---
What is justified is concern for the execution of layering. It is kind of janky right now, and obviously not where it needs to be in a variety of ways. That’s said, we’re 2.5 months out. Layering has been in the beta what, 2 weeks?  Let’s not be too alarmist just yet.
---
no he didnt, he reported because he was mad you can go watch the clip google "asmongold ooga gang"
---
he may make fun of himself but that doesn't mean he's incapable of getting mad, holy shit people put these guys on pedastels he's just a dr pepper drinking shut in who depended on his dad's money until he made it big streaming a children's video game
---
Man. Everything went downhill for me after classic wow. The real world hit me hard as fuck.
---
Blastershot Launcher. 😎
---
Hell yea
---
I used to murder my guild during the play in Karazan. I would throw a knife at the audience right before boss kill which would add some real drama. and then vanish.
---
That is completely boss specific, read up on [wiki's for fight encounter information](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Molten_Core_(original) (Lucifron is mostly decursing, etc). Mage's mostly just spam bolt's until their oom, then wand. 
---
Fights are simple in vanilla, they mostly come down to: Tank brings them ____ so raid doesn't wipe, certain groups stand in designated spots, ranged classes max range to not get hit by AOE's.
---
I gotta start posting this to all the asmongold fanboys
---
Lolol but seriously thank you... I about it till just now for this month
---
Yes! This is the greenest it’s ever been here apparently
---
Woop i can call myself exotic now!
---
This looks amazing and also is my favorite 5 man instance in the entire game. So massive so many different routes just a super cool place.
---
&gt;Like I said: The only reason you believe this is because you haven't acknowledged that players are all, across the board, different from back then. Back then people didn't know how to play well. Now they do.
---
So just because people know how to play now suddenly means they want AV to be a zergfest?
---
Really? Everywhere you look, the community is saying the contrary. Nobody cares about AV because they want to "get rewards quick", they care because they miss what it used to be.
---
The people who want to get rewards quick, the people who want to be showered in rewards everywhere they go and refuse to do anything that doesn't give them something, even if it's fun...BFA is the game for them. The mentality of playing to get a reward instead of playing for the sake of having fun is what has plagued WoW ever since BC. I, for one, would much rather play an Alterac Valley that's rewardless but very engaging instead of one that showers you in marks of honor but is nothing more than a mindless, brainless zerg.
---
Yep, same. Also narrowed it down to the two pet classes for my main. And I'm 100% making this decision based on wPvP potential, and nothing else. Both Lock/Hunter are at the top of the World PvP tier list, which doesn't make it any easier. 
---
I like the solo-ability of a hunter which the Lock lacks, yet I prefer the aesthetic and survivability of a Warlock. I like the Hunters combat style a bit more though over DoT damage. I'm honestly stuck on this decision. Like I'm leaning Warlock, but I'm by no means "sold" on it.
---
You guys truly think, that switching between layers as you wish isnt dangerous for game experience and wont affect us?
---
&gt; A few months ago the sub seemed to favour the old AV.
---
The population has changed it seems. People are defending sharding and many opposed to the old AV.
---
Yea you’re exactly right man. Not sure why people think WoW isn’t social! I have a way better time on WoW than I do at parties and I’ve been to plenty of parties. Boring as fuck.
---
Hey thanks for the answer. That makes sense!
---
Mage or Lock. 
---
Most Warlocks used to be Mages, until they craved more power and went to the dark side. At least i believe that how the lore goes. It was that way for me. Started Mage and got to 30, then I realized I could summon demons and curse my foes. 
---
So maybe Warlock &gt; Mage, then what ever after that.
---
Druid's are amazing flag carriers and point defenders.
---
They can also tank mobs in AV.
---
That's just BGs, you can have a lot of fun and success as a Druid in WPvP.
---
In PvE you're gear sponges, you can get a lot of gear for a lot of different specs.
---
Sure none of your specs are the best at anything, but you can have good gear for each spec to supplement that and if you're a good Druid, that bumps you up a notch even more.
---
It's like the opposite for me... I actually had to quit playing wow during TBC because I couldn't afford the monthly subscription fee. Now it's not an issue at all.
---
If solo trib is possible what are then Best?
---
Old Blizzard yes.  I doubt John Staats would write that about Actiblizzard.
---
We have no idea because blizzard is keeping all of the details from us. I'd suspect we'll get all the details around 30 days before release. 
---
I think they will put every item in the instance, with 1.12 stats, regardless of what phase it's in.
---
I have a feeling you haven't completed all the quests.
---
“Feeling cute might just ban you later... idk”
---
FIFY
---
I'll remember for the rest of my life when Diablo 3  released. It was on the day I had my English exam I'm Dutch myself. I knew I 'had' to play it immediately at midnight so I did and I played till 8 in the morning and then had to go to school to take the exam. While playing Diablo all night long and taking the time to read the story and practicing that way I managed to get a 8.5 out of 10 :D
---
This clips shows nothing...You can't prove a MECHANIC with one clip that shows him sprinting in and hitting a warrior on a Z axis. Melee Leeway giving an exra 2.66 yards was not in the game until MOP or so. Sorry buddy
---
i support all of this as long as level cap stays at 60.
---
You only compete against your own faction.
---
Yeah not only do PLAYERs have melee leeway but also mobs have it which is completely wrong in both ways
---
Sperg, AIDS, and hyperbolic are tied for Word of 2019 award.
---
Technically I could afford one but many other priorities that goes before pc right now. I hopefully join in next spring or so :)
---
Is this an out-of-season April Fools joke?
---
That looks really fun actually. Could any of your abilities still be used while looking like a wisp?
---
Life finds a way
---
Thanks for posting this North. You are right on explaining how some hits seem far off. But never until MOP did players actually GAIN real passive static range when both targets are moving. Things with PING and Latency can seem a bit far off; but nothing with static testing will be ever be shown because it didn't exist.
---
This! Hell yeah it was grindy and getting to 60 as a naive 12 year old was punishing, but that’s what made it great! When you dinged you felt like you earned it, and you earned the talent point that came with it. MMOs should be grindy (in my opinion). 
---
One of my buddies still plays, every now and then when I’m around at his house ill have a little go on his account. It honestly feels like a mobile game to me, it’s so easy and linear. The talent points, the spells, the quality of life changes.. it all just feels dumbed down and diluted to me.
---
The phasing took away the social aspect, which I loved. You could potentially be stood around 50 players but you’d never know..
---
Idk man it just doesn’t feel like an MMO or an RPG to me anymore
---
I've thought this through and have spent more time in the last two days proposing a Cluster server system than I'd spent on here in the prior months. My hope is that Blizzard reconsiders this shardi-..."layering" thing that will make the world (in their Vanilla recreation) feel blatantly digital and artificial and picks something that offers a natural, if clunky during merges, experience to their players.
---
&gt; Really? Everywhere you look, the community is saying the contrary.
---
I'm looking all over r/classicwow and yes, you're unironically pointing out what those of us realists have been complaining about for a year:
---
**This place is an echo-chamber!**
---
Yes! You're right but for all the wrong reasons! Of *course* everyone is *saying* the contrary!
---
Soda is horde
---
This is NOT in Vanilla. Please Blizzard fix this
---
Streamers follow the money. these guys were all playing retail a few months ago hating on classic. if classic doesnt get them viewers, they will immediately quit.  they are the last people who's opinion matters.
---
&gt; You're failing to see the point that BoS isn't something a single player needs to optimize for, it's just there in a raid, all players on Alliance gain the advantage of it in terms of PvE Progression.
---
And we are talking about the initial point where a casual selects their faction: Months before they ever encounter a Paladin in a raid.
---
Blizzard on adds like on neff
---
I totally decided to pronounce that as Beeth Oven btw
---
Assistant to the deputy of stormwind
---
Is the world still messed up from the cataclysm? Don’t get me wrong, I get what blizzard was trying to do and make the game feel fresh, and it was a really good idea in theory.
---
It just broke my heart seeing the barrens split in 2 and the big whirlpool in STV. That’s one of the main reasons I stopped playing.. I’m one of those blokes that hate change haha
---
AV was always an instance though. Most servers just didn't have the population for more than one at a time. I don't disagree that using the 1.12 version of AV is about as bad as it can get but Blizzard is not trying to further an agenda here, this is actually what 1.12 AV was like. It sucked, and an argument could be made that AV should be like it was pre 1.10 but it's pretty unlikely they listen, let alone care.

It's not a matter of what anyone wants, it's what is. The good players wont waste their time, and will just zerg. The casuals will also zerg, because why would they gimp their group? Plus if they know they are casuals, they realize they dont inherently know the best methods, so they'll adopt them from the good players.
---
Barbarous Blade, or Brutality Blade + Core Hound Tooth will be a lot better.
---
If the leaf drops in phase 1 it might be a different story.
---
&gt; That is often true but is not accurate here.
---
&gt; I've thought this through and have spent more time in the last two days discussing a Cluster server system than I'd spent on here in the prior months.
---
Yikers. So you think you're the smartest guy in the room. Gotcha. Yeah, not interested in arguing with someone who comes off like this.
---
I was in a 3 men group doing all the quests, the xp was shared so I think maybe that's why..
---
No, you have to dual wield to put one hand or off hand weapons in your second weapon slot.  Druids cannot dual wield.  The “held in off hand” accessories I believe are an armor type rather than a weapon so they’re not restricted
---
You can raid at any level with a 31/8/12 pvp spec and also be extremely proficient in pvp. 
---
High crit is necessary, and 5/8 Nightslayer for 120 energy. Coupled with a Renataki's trinket from ZG and you will be unstoppable.
---
"you must have atleast 1,000 subscribers to play this game. Or a D cup"
---
Well that explains that.
---
Wyoming is mulgore. Period.
---
It really won’t be that easy. There’s no raid finder or group finder, and you need to wrangle 40 people together to do them. Unless you get in a guild that has a spot for you, good luck.
---
Crap, let me edit.
---
Wyoming, specially southern is mulgore. Its based off the rolling plains.
---
Perfect. Pleasure working with you!
---
I couldn’t say for sure because the last time I played was Cata, but I think it’s a combination of things 
---
- level boosts
---
- easier mobs to kill
---
-the threat of dying when levelling isn’t really there anymore
---
- mounts at low levels 
---
- too many flight paths
---
- **phasing and layering**
---
Blizzard has spectacular phasing technology, but it has absolutely no place in an MMO. It’s an oxymoron.
---
But that’s just from the perspective of somebody who hasn’t had a subscription in years, so take it with a pinch of salt :)
---
There's still more quests outside of just kharanos. Even grouped easily passed 10 but you can skip them and grind for sure
---
Yeah. I think he is trolling.
---
Thank you dude!
---
You should learn what layering actually is then, friend. Because it isn't sharding. You seem to be under the impression that with layering there will not be hundreds or thousands of people competing for mobs in the starting area - when in fact they will. It will, of course, potentially fix the issue of server merges - but possibly by near-permanently fucking the server's economy.
---
That honestly gave me goosebumps, I know exactly what music you’re talking about
---
Its going to be phase 2, if they are adding benediction in phase 2 which came from majordomo then i see no reason why they would give hunters a soecial favor for no reason
---
AV epics are not better than stuff from BWL except in fringe cases or for people who care more about PVP than raiding, and even then only in a PVP scenario. The real problem with the "free epics" is that AV epics are super easy to get and invalidate earlier stuff as soon as it's out without requiring someone gear up through a prior raid tier. Truthfully, the gear issues are the least of our concerns. AV shouldn't be released until stage 3 though it's possible it'll come with stage 2. The real problem is just how braindead 1.12 AV was, the need for an actual strategy in regards to creating a team to oppose the opposite faction, a team to collect shit, and a team to prevent back-caps was completely eliminated in 1.10 in favor of a 40vs40 battle royale. Fun though it may be in the short term, it obliterated the sense of accomplishment and teamwork.
---
look up "X raid guide" on youtube
---
Look up your consumable list on this reddit
---
look up how to farm as a mage
---
Search AH for those raw mats/consumes and buy low after you get lvl 40 mount
---
You should be skinning + mining/herb almost no questions asked unless veteran status player, until 40 and mount at least
---
Looks really nice, but I think you should’ve used the last boss instead of the stone dude
---
Ganking will happen less on a fresh classic realm. 
---
Most of the horde and alliance that get to STV first will be focusing on leveling extremely fast. Ganking can be a waste of time because you will be counter ganked. 
---
It's a lot easier to just quest in peace and gtfo outa STV then spend time trying to PvP. 
---
Also in classic, there is a lot to do. Big pvp battles will happen in places like hillsbrad but elsewhere will be a lot less chaotic. 
---
There is so much to do in classic. Wasting time ganking lowbies will be low priority to a lot of people vs farming epic mount, dungeons, enchants, maxing tradeskills etc
---
No blues dropped for me.
---
Is using my left elbow on the keyboard trap not good enough?
---
Is this an advertisement for Brainful Content
---
I love all of it. I hope they turn this into an alternate timeline via classic.
---
There should at least be *some* PvP servers with this option available. Seems a simple thing to implement and I think most people would be attracted to this.
---
Thunder bluff and Ironforge are the best cities in the game, it is known.
---
Not true. Again, those who pick their faction based on advantages are the minority. The majority pick what they want and follow friends. The majority are the numbers you see in server imbalances. So if a server is imbalanced it's because of the majority NOT the minority, it isn't because people are picking the OP faction. 
---
Faction imbalance happens naturally once you have enough servers. For every one that leans one way there's another that leans equally the opposite. If you merged those two together you'd have one balanced server.
---
You can wing clip from further away than normal if you do get in range.
---
My bad, i was half asleep when I read your comment bud :)
---
Breath attack does wonders and keeps it out of the way if you have to.
---
Not great until you get max rank from son of haakar.
---
That depends on what you mean by "the audience." Blizzard has a habit of cherry picking retarded criticism to call out, to make themselves appear wise and reasonable. Blizzard also has a habit of getting defensive about their decisions and their work-product and using these kinds of tactics to discredit the community's response to it.
---
Preech! Where do I sign?
---
I just afked out of an 8 hour AV
---
I'd do something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbebRxpVohfZAM0M
---
But note, I made this in mind with the night elf racial and a cloak enchant in mind to get a level 5 MoD with only spending 3/5 points.
---
In addition to what he said Blood Elves got Arcane Torrent, an AoE silence without diminishing returns. 
---
&gt;Arcane torrent :
---
&gt;2 min cool down
---
&gt;Silences all enemies within 8 yards for 2 sec, and gives you 10 energy or 10+2.16/level mana per manatap charge currently on you.
---
&gt;Gives 161 mana/torrent at level 70, or 483mana for 3 torrents
---
Stupid. Turns battles.
---
I can't believe I have to explain basic math to someone but okay here we go
---
&gt; those who pick their faction based on advantages are the minority. 
---
What you're saying here is: Faction balance is essentially a coin toss 50/50 if you're taking into account *the majority* of players.
---
&gt; if a server is imbalanced it's because of the majority NOT the minority
---
This contradicts your previous statement since the only people who care about the **material** differences between factions are “a minority.”
---
&gt; it isn't because people are picking the OP faction.
---
If the majority picks “what they want”, meaning a 50/50 distribution, then when you account for the minority of players favoring one faction over the other, then *by definition* it's the minority of players who push the balance out of whack.

That was certainly true almost 20 years ago. But now...
---
&gt; Looks more or less exactly the same as the retail version, mobs are too weak, objectives are pretty useless and without shit like Mine-layer and ridicilously strong mobs, it will be a complete zergfest.
---
8 hours is far too fast of a game I can't believe the state of Classic
---
A man who knows his priorities, I respect that! We’ll be waiting with open arms for your return :)
---
The first week will be the worst time to play it
---
Most min/max guilds will have around 4-5 Locks.
---
Way tldr
---
PvP in classic wow is the shallowest PvP experience. Most classes have only one skill you have to look out for, there is no arena, and the most exciting thing in most match ups is a crit. 
---
It is pathetic.
---
Yup. They use a lot of functions with multiplication in their sheets.
---
Sell the wife, sell the kids, sell the house!
---
I was a kid during my WoW days, I was a hell of a lot happier and more innocent back then. These days I tend to have big depresso at adult life
---
Anyways, this is tiring.
---
Some people want to be the OP faction because they want to ride the train.
---
Others choose the underdogs because you have more enemies available to kill, less competition from your faction for gear and in the economy, easier to climb in honor system etc
---
Just saying, the door swings both ways and neither are indicative of the source of why servers are imbalanced.
---
Then again maybe I'm wrong, maybe those who care about the logical advantages are the minority and those who go for the "Me wanna be on the strongest side hurr durr" mentally are the majority.
---
Things can still dodge if you attack them from behind, they just can't parry.
---
shame you can't use the "Elder" title in classic for this :P
---
depressing era? they mean when we were kids going on with our lives with no real life worries? where we would go to school in the morning and be home in the early afternoon? where our worst nightmare was if we had bad grades and got grounded?
---
compare that to now where we are working to advance our careers and make a living, except now the consequences for screwing up is your whole god damn life :P  
---
Yes ofc being a kid free to go on worry free with barely any responsibilities is more depressing than being shouldering the responsibilities the come from having families, monthly mortgage and bills.
---
*The audience* has a habit of cherry picking retarded criticism to call out, to make themselves appear wise and reasonable. *The audience* also has a habit of getting defensive about their claims and their findings and using these kinds of tactics to discredit the Blizzard's response to it.
---
I don't know of any mage specific series, but since mages have pretty good views there are a lot of mage pov boss fights. If you're just looking for mechanics or the flow of the fight that works well enough. Raserisk has a great youtube series that goes over whole fights in later tiers from a general perspective.
---
This shows how stupid people are. "i have spend 2 days thinking about stuff and now i know everything better than a company who haves decades of actual experience on the matter".
---
The problem in most gaming communities is that people don't just stop at analysing systems. They go one step further and try to analyse motives. For instance, it's one thing to say that "Retail is bad"; it's another thing entirely to say "Retail is bad because the devs are lazy money-grubbers". One statement can be backed up by objective analysis - the other is almost entirely speculative.  
---
Again, a lot of these predictions regarding motive aren't baseless, but they are nonetheless made based off incomplete information. This is kind of why open communication from developers is so critical, as it vastly reduces community speculation.
---
Also, they can be fucking wrong, and have been so many times. The public only reacts to what we get, and retail is a bunch of trash, so it doesn't matter how or why they made the decisions to kill it, but they still did. This did is out of touch.
---
It’s cause it’s a beta and your mind subconsciously remember that they are temporary and will be gone. Once classic drops and you spend time with your new too , make new memories like that time you died fighting hogger or escaped getting ganged in stv, you’ll get more attached.
---
To be fair I am pretty sure it was two tryhard streamer groups against each other.
---
I always loved the whole Native American parallels with Tauren. The grassy plains, the panpipe music, the teepee tents. Gives me the tingles man
---
I was going to post this myself! I don't think the layering parts are well thought out decision from them even if we are the players and they k ow what's really going on.
---
I am a tank main at heart in every game I play. I have control issues, like dictating how things go. 
---
In Overwatch and WoW I am always the MT.
---
Going Female Tauren Hunter here!
---
mothers?
---
Oh yeah, release is gonna be a completely different animal.  Completely agree with you on layering.  Every solution to tourists/release madness is gonna have problems but I think it's foolish to just not do anything.  It would be pretty awful for Classic  to turn off a huge portion of players on the first day/week because the game is nearly unplayable.
---
Man... I don’t really remember marks of honor. It’s been so long . I am curious nkw. Does it give rep for the bg ? Like specific marks? Or by win. . I feel I remember something of that sort

---
will take an enhance shaman with 100% raid attendance over a flaky healer shaman that doesnt want to be there erry day
---
Go ench shaman and find a good guild, see if you get to be the one they’ll allow
---
So you know about the phases, yet don't think each raid is going to be cleared on the first night it is released?  Azuregos, Kazzak, Nef, C'Thun will all be dead before Method even can start.  They can maybe race for Ony/Rag, but that's it until Naxx.  I'm not even sure Naxx will prove a challenge since we all know the tried and true Vanilla strategies.  The best guilds won't be surprised about needing a ton of tanks for Horsemen, they will have those alts already geared up and ready to roll.
---
So once again, I think this is a joke by Method because there isn't much of a race for world "first".
---
That free gear balances out in Vanilla by not being able to do anything solo without taking ages.
---
Yeah he plays, super casually but he has 2 young kids and 60 hour contract so it's all you can do without becoming a hermit. He just wants a week to vedge like the good old days first though.
---
!SEGNAHC ON
---
I guarantee MC and all other instances and raids will have their full loot tables regardless of what phase it's in. Blizz wanted to put DM in the game at the start. Do you think they are going to spend that much time updating loot tables for each patch or just put everything in at once with the instance?
---
r/Pokémon, take note.
---
I mean, sure, you can reverse the argument - but it doesn't make sense. The audience gets very little feedback from Blizzard most of the time, and as a consequence they over-analyze what they receive. But I am specifically referring to Blizzard (metaphorically) standing in a room, listening to 3 criticisms, and purposely picking the dumbest one to respond to because its easier than dealing with sophisticated criticism. I think John is wrong is here, because if you ignore what Blizzard says and just watch the actions they take you can pretty accurately infer where their priorities lie and what their philosophy is. The problem in BFA has been, a very large number of players don't like those priorities and have come to believe their philosophy is harmful.
---
Everything that drops will be in the game.
---
I want to level a Paladin so I can Prot dungeon farm. Prot is my favourite spec but I know raiding will be pretty pointless. 
---
How often do you guys respec? Every raid? Seems like a waste of gold but I want to do it.
---
Remember that you said: 
---
&gt;Sure, but you still haven't made the jump from problem-finding to solution-providing.
---
So here we've looped back around to the appeal to authority. Apparently Blizzard knows what is best for us such that nobody is able to offer viable alternatives...except when they do, then it's, "Yikes, dawg".
---
I'm likewise uninterested in continuing after this. Corporate worship, as I found in TBC, WotLK, and Cata, creates a barrier.
---
I wouldnt bother with spell power whilst levelling
---
Doesn't the extended melee range basically nullify your dead zone? It'll be much harder to kite, but shouldn't it also be much harder for crafty casters to deadzone you?
---
I definitely believe the only way to bring vanilla back is to patch some of inefficiencies and annoyances. To properly allow for gameplay from all classes and specs, rather than the “THATS NOT VANILLA” approach, I think giving paladins a taunt and resto druids tweaks would be the best way
---
Despite the overbearing "leetspeak"
---
Did you just do the internet comment equivalent to sticking your fingers in your ears while saying what you believe in true? And then announce your departure as if your contribution to the conversation has any value?

"Talking in third person and leaving now, bye."
---
Oh wow, not this excerpt again. I think it surfaced initially last year or shortly after Blizzcon 2017 and I remember making a long post explaining how ridiculous these statements by Staats are. I'd search for it but I tend to write long posts so I doubt I'll find it easily.
---
Not only is what he's saying extremely pretentious and high-horsed, but also a clear indication of how oblivious he is to the 'higher up' powers that affect the game's ultimate direction and form. Especially now, under Activision, you'd be a fool if you're a big  developer and think you have any real power to say what gets done how and why.
---
Anyway, on the topic of Layering, I think it wont be all that bad as long as it's heavily monitored and controlled during the first few weeks and ultimately turned off globally after phase 1 as they've 'promised'.
---
i would have to think mage.
---
ping must have been absolutely garbage from there lol

Nah man, I'm sure this post will go over very well on this sub.

Many people take issue with the Warcraft movie but it’s one of the best fantasy films ever made right behind LOTR
---
If Dire Maul North: Tribute can be soloed, then engineering is best to blast open the Inner Gordok Door. Otherwise you will need a rogue for it or blacksmithing. The Truesilver skeleton keys are far more expensive then those Seaforium Charges (althoug Skeleton Keys don't waste backslots). 
---
Because you need Thorium Ore for those Charges, Engineering is best combined with Mining.
---
Although I had no problems with Skinning and Engineering. Thorium Ore is mostly very cheap at the AH, so you can trade Leather against Ore.
---
I remember Ret being insanity at the start and end of LK. Perfect time to be a Pally imo.

pretty sure they said they were going to be pretty finatical about the gear progression, eg rokdelar and benediction etc wont drop until AQ.

My 42 night elf hunter had all white like sub 30-gear cause i thought it looked cool. And I mean it was white looking, might have been green or white or blues, that didn't matter none to me. There were cloth and mail and leather mixed with spirit, strength and agility. Had a blast.

If you do all the quests you should be 10 easily, if not grind troggs in the quarry. Once u get tame pet, you can then head to the human zone and quest away there and start in westfall or Loch Modan from 12ish onwards.

It's entirely possible getting rage from dodges is something they added in a later expansion. I never tanked in vanilla, so I'm not sure. However, this Wowpedia article from July 2006 says that blocks/parries/dodges that you perform also generate rage: https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Rage&amp;oldid=194055#Being_Hit
---
As the other guy said being able to do solo trib means that eng is insanely good for hunters.
---
On top of that mining allows you to make your own thorium arrows though if you're making plenty of gold the gathering prof isn't too important (but I'd still go eng/mining).
---
Greata, I'm gonna have to no-life Fire Emblem 3 houses so I have time to no-life classic until I take a break to no-life Doom/pokemon in November, with a side of Link's Awakening in between then.  RIP social life for the rest of the year.
---
Why are you paying your Heart of Azeroth?
---
I thoroughly enjoyed the Warcraft Movie. There’s a lot of lore to play around with there!
---
Just by default rogues and mages. They usually will make up the bulk of a raid team. 
---
Warriors are by and large the strongest class in vanilla. But not everyone returning will have years and years private server experience and most people will play their vanilla dream class. 
---
Also having too many warriors will dilute your loot pool. 
---
On a fresh server. You're not always going to get weapon drops, and weapon drops are some of the most important factors for early raid progression. 
---
So taking what you can, and utilizing it is key for early progression. 
---
If you have 20 warriors, it will take a long time to get them all chomatically tempered swords, nightmare blades etc. Not to mention sharing all that gear drops. 
---
My guild is reforming for classic and we are running 7 warriors. 2 will be mainly focused on prot and will be the MTs for a majority of content. Two will.be fury but also be getting all the extra prot gear. 
---
This will hopefully give us 4 prot warriors who can rotate duties should one take a day off, which will happen, then we will have 4 tanks ready for fights like twin emps and 4 horseman when they come out. 
---
The other 3 will be plate rogues. Just being dps kings and helping break down DPS checks. 
---
Healers, were horde, is 6 priests 2 druids 2 shamans.  Druids and shamans will he able to float more between different specs depending on content and once things are on farm. 
---
The other bulk of the guild will be whatever people feel like playing and investing in. Rogues mages warlocks hunters whatever you'll have fun with and want to play. 
---
40 man raids sometimes boil down to who can show up and finding 40 people who know how to deal damage and play their class.
---
you don't want to live in your mom's basement until age 65 playing vidya gamez instead of raising a family? whats wrong with you bro?
---
No problem, happy to help.    
---
I just read your message down below and what I wanted to add is that the biggest difference is, when the set conditions for the spell are not met, the macro never actually (tries to) cast the spell.  
---
Now I can be very wrong with the following statement but this might be important because if I remember correctly trying to cast a spell with input lag (high ping, ...) still initiates the Global Cooldown (Client Side) until the server tells the client that the action you wanted to perform is not possible. And if my assumption is true, then you would lose time to perform something else in the meantime.    
---
This might not be as big of a problem nowadays with better connections.
---
&gt; Any version of "1.13" that doesn't include a raised level cap to 70 to flush the mess that is left behind by Vanilla down the toilet to start fresh is a mistake.

Or just nerf Naxx gear?
---
Thank you kind sir/person for your message

I don't know what a Molton is.

My wife is a noob. She's played on some private servers with me and likes the game, but she's pretty slow with some things and has a hard time doing multiple things at once. Definitely a keyboard turner.
---
She'll be my leveling buddy, but it'll be tough because I'll want to min/max everything
---
I wish he had honed the quote to refer more specifically to the general, knee-jerk player base who are judging the character of the developoers/producers/designers. I'd agree with him there; getting angry at someone and judging their character based off of a game system is to be avoided. 
---
It's irksome that his implication is that there is no room for argument from anybody. That, because we missed the meeting, our functional brain's interpretation of what these systems do to our gaming experience is invalid or less valid.
---
How are the special pets in Classic beta?  Is Lupos Shadow or Physical?  Are cats normalized or do they have different speeds?
---
To the second question: pets like Lupos won't do shadow damage, but BT will still have good attack speed.
---
Unless you are min maxing, it doesn’t matter. Your DPS, healing and tanking is fine for mc and BWL, and if your good, then AQ40 too. 
---
Just find a guild and be a good player and you’ll be fine as any class. 
---
Play what you enjoy, not what is best.
---
I say warlock
---
Cries in paladin
---
Swamp Jags in SOS are between 25-35g an hour, the bulk of which is vendor greys, when farmed on a level 38-40 character with skinning. Inefficiently, and on a PvP server it's still likely to be 15g an hour minimum at 40.
---
That's one of the more well known methods that'll be flooded on release, there's other mobs in the game with a higher GP/HP ratio at that range but it's best not to talk about them.
---
I am literally in your exact same scenario but I prefer Alliance since I played it as a young one. Let me know what you do because I don't know.

Not Priest.

Being able to fd/trap midfight is reliant on fast button mashing (or macros?) and good ping. Pet micro isn't that big of a deal outside of optimising fights perfectly.
---
Honestly there are only 2 or 3 specs that really struggle, Boomkin, Paladin tanks and Elemental shamans, every other spec can work so they're not a burden some just take a lot of effort to get to an acceptable level (Feral druid DPS for e.g) and resto druids can do good healing it's just that they were usually told to give their innervate to holy priests instead of using it on themselves so they couldn't keep up.

[Blasted Lands was based off of Greater Sudbury in Ontario, Canada.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blasted_Lands#Notes_and_trivia).
---
Like 4 mins in, sorry I was slightly wrong, but after a few weeks there should be only a single layer.
---
BM while leveling is too good to pass up on. Your pet becomes an absolute unit.
---
They would answer also to the "sophisticated criticism" if someone actually would make that kind of criticism. "BUuT mUH laYeRringsss REEEEEE" is not sophisticated criticism.
---
I figured they can kill mobs quick while feeling safe in pretty much any 1v1 encounter as Shadow.
---
This is amazing. Make sure to roll an Undead beacause... obvious reasons :&gt;
---
Eat food during flight paths, duh.

Seriously. Frostbolt. Maybe a sheep

Not sure why I'm being downvoted.. I never said I was surprised. Blizzard having poor communication and being out of touch isn't new news by any means but I still find it interesting when they do things like this without thinking it through.
---
He's been a regular Blizzard white knight on this subreddit for a long time now. Has a history of getting salty when he doesn't "win" the discussion.
---
Classic isn’t for everyone! It’s for the folk who miss vanilla! If you get bored go play BfA!
---
I didn't realise being part of a community in original wow is depressing compared to just hitting a button to find a party in modern wow.
---
Shh.... we can't ALL be Undead.... :-)
---
If its true classic, focusing on pets with very high attack speed is the way to go. Broken Tooth was the pet to have in vanilla due to the interrupts on casters.
---
hey if the beta was free then i would probably be more inclined to test av.
---
They made like 6g lol
---
The build is garbage and not fun to play in the slightest. I don’t know what boxes you are trying to tick here, but this is not going to be fun nor efficient. 
---
Do what any sane person would do, level as arms with the standard spec (31/20) and stay arms up until you start raiding. This way you can handle yourself in the open world and easily rank all 5 mans and ubrs. 
---
You can also go fury DW at 60 if you wanna sacrifice pvp ability for more pve presence, DW fury will help with both damage and tps

I wasn't talking specifically about layering. Not going to invest much in a response to this because most of your comments are low effort one liners and you sound young. At least, I hope you are.

I remember demand for flying mounts being pretty high

You can look an item up on itemization.info to see what patch it was added in.

Farmer, Mage. Solo, Warlock.
---
Warlock has far more survival tools. Mage has more grindy tools.
---
Ah. Classic moments. Raiding AQ40. We're on the last trash before C'thun after a long night. A Warlock pulls aggro, the mobs run up and kill him and then kill a nearby healer. Things cascade from there and we're about to wipe. I feign death on my hunter just before my dad bursts in through the door and beats the shit out of me with jumper cables.

Mage DM solo

Is it going to be Eu or Us timezone guild?
---
&gt;Looks like 2 weeks of nothing but ~~work and~~ Classic WoW.
---
How do you think your wife is going to react when she comes home and finds out you've been fired?
---
Good, increased honour would be reasonable when it's unbalanced
---
&gt; gtfo because people know less than a tiny fraction of what goes on
---
Not enough to be against the idea but enough to be vehemently in favor of it?
---
Take your own advice.
---
Yes this is probably good to know. Also ally or horde?
---
It was an example of these sophisticated criticism people tend to give. You must be pretty young if you didn't understand that. Also your need of attacking me personally shows that you don't have any actual arguments. One liners that are facts are better than wallsof texts of total BS.
---
I don't see enough green trees to see the comparison.

Even the black rocks and nickel rich soil are supplemented by huge green forests.

Lol. Welcome to the US. It's called at-will employment. As long at they aren't dumb and say it directly then you *will* feel the pressure to do the OT. Especially salaried.
---
Dancers to a Discordant System has got to be my favorite track by them. It's just immensely powerful and puts me in this vegetative trance as soon as the intro flows into the first drop. Meshuggah are definitely a great choice to have playing in the background while playing WoW. Maybe In Flames for more PvP-oriented action.
---
But Meshuggah is just straight 10/10.
---
I'm pretty sure it's safe to say Uldum is inspired by Egypt.

Love them. Don't stop until you've covered all the unused zones.

---
That's crazy I'd never heard of that! Yeah I don't know either. I am a software developer but not games by any means, so I have no real insight into what they had to work with 15+ years ago during development. But it probably wasn't great. My thought is simply that they wouldn't have to actually make twice as much animations from scratch, it would just be mirrors of the normal animations. But as you're saying with Zelda it might not be as easy as Simply mirroring the animations code-wise.
---
I've heard stories of people losing or gaining weight in vanilla.  Its safe to say ones waistline will not be the same when one started.
---
This is the most accurate wow classic 'starter kit'
---
Or act like a dick and think that streaming and their fanbois will cover it.
---
Handism 😂👌
---
Probably like me.
---
Sit your ass outside the dungeon and play gameboy until someone comes along.
---
That doesn't answer my question.  It explains why I ask the question, but it doesn't answer it.
---
Hello fellow Crushridge player. I was horde, but I hope our paths cross again. Lol Tar Ogar!
---
The truest answer to this question is: when you start raiding, no. But once you've raided with the same crew for a while, you have some content on farm, and most immortality *you've built up your rapport in your guild as a solid raider in your normal raiding spec*, only then you might find opportunities to try and offspec raid based on your guild's personality.
---
Don't fill out applications as boomkin spec and expect to be called back.
---
Warriors are the best and normally what you have the most of in a raid, but Warlocks are really hard to come by and they were always the hardest class to recruit on private servers.
---
Exactly, it's great you guys are here to point out bugs and not unironically act like the beta is the finished product! Thank god for people like you that simply report a bug without insinuating anything on top! God bless.
---
Alright... I was fully expecting the last paragraph to end in..
---
 in nineteen ninety-eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer’s table.
---
Some people find it ridiculous people are getting emotional over missing out on a beta test. I don’t get why everyone is so worked up.
---
Seems like Classic just isn't for you. Perhaps you should look out for other games on the market.
---
You run through mama like it's your job
---
Really good point. I'm curious if there were people who intentionally learned the opposite. In my fake experience fighting in Amtgard years ago (LARP) I seemed to have an advantage against right handers because the side I was wielding a weapon was the same side they were when facing each other and thus largely negated the benefit of their shield as it would be difficult to hold it all the way across their body AND do any sort of offensive move.
---
Eh dont choose your class based on what might be in demand for 40 mans. Pick the class that seems the most fun for you.
---
Lol you crossed out the word work 😂 if anything she’ll be pissed that my man cave is filthy and I smell like a hippo’s arse
---
Meanwhile, Blizzard, you might have all the information, but monkey with access to the internet remains a monkey.
---
Beer fear? 
---
Snowflake.
---
&gt; So here we've looped back around to the appeal to authority. Apparently Blizzard knows what is best for us such that nobody is able to offer viable alternatives...except when they do, then it's, "Yikes, dawg".
---
That is not what John's post said at all. He didn't even say that players didn't know what they were talking about or were not able to offer good suggestions, what he said is they are always wrong about WHY Blizzard makes their decisions, and he didn't even defend Blizzard's actions by saying they always make the right call. All he is saying is that the player base looks at everything one-dimensionally because they only have one point of view and lack important data and statistics only Blizzard has. 
---
Are the queues for BGs taking too long and a huge drop in BG PvP taking place? The player base will assume it's because Blizzard is inept at balancing classes and think that rebalancing them would fix the issue. Blizzard on the other hand has access to data behind the scenes, they see that most of these people that quit BGs are doing an increased amount of dueling and world PvP, because they still like PvP and class balance, they just don't like the queue times. Blizzard decides that lowering the queue times would get people to come back, so they create cross-realm BGs to speed up the queue times. But the entire time everyone is yelling that they hate BGs being cross-realm and Blizzard did this because they are lazy and can't balance classes, so they did something like this.
---
Now that's not me using a real example, at least I don't think so. It's just a hypothetical to get the point across. Players can see the problem, they know there is a drop in players doing BGs, but only the tiniest fraction even bother speaking out and happen to be the few people saying THEY quit because of class balance, so everyone starts screaming about that since that is all the information they have, when the real issue, that only Blizzard knew due to server data, was something else entirely. Don't waste time nitpicking my example, it was entirely hypothetical and probably very inaccurate, but it gets the point across of lacking information and the perceived information players actually think they have from a vocal minority as their data.
---
It has nothing to do with bowing down to authority or discrediting players, it's literally fact that people who aren't part of the company lack a lot of information on what is happening because they are missing tons of data that changes what the actual solution and even the problem is. [He even complimented the players and said they had very intelligent arguments](https://i.imgur.com/CthsdOw.png), it seems like you can't read and instead of understanding his actual point, you decided to shit on him for the wrong reason and actually made a fool of yourself in the process. So [congratulations](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ClutteredWastefulCuscus-poster.jpg) on that.
---
i had to have a skin bridge lazered off my dink. can confirm the smell of burning flesh is terrifying.
---
Yup im literally going to be grinding satyrs for a bunch of levels. Bank all felcloth for a few months and unload when the price skyrockets
---
lupos is physical and speeds are not normalized in 1.12
---
Classic wow? It is a gift.
---
No. There is melee leeway. It's an advantage melee attacks get if their target is moving. If you simply stop moving it goes away. Example: You're 6 yards away from that rogue trying to cripple you while you run? Too bad. He's got extended range of +2 so he can hit you.
---
(As I also just now commented on something above) That was my experience fake fighting back when I LARPd. Certainly I was more open to someone as a lefty against a righty BUT it largely negated the benefit of their shield and more often than not they weren't super use to or sure of how to handle the lost benefit. Although obviously none of us were highly trained lifelong fighters 😂
---
av is stage 3
---
And thats why it is the right choice.
---
&gt;You really felt like you were balancing your crits with fire, searching for a pyroblast proc. it was very engaging and fun. Classic wow doesn't have anywhere near that level of complexity 
---
If your definition of complexity that classic lacks is pressing fireball until you crit and then pressing pyroblast, you’re just searching for a reason not to like classic.
---
Yeah as I said this the one real reason I could imagine consciously deciding against doing it.
---
Yeah there pretty much bis or on par with bis. Its either these guys or elder wizards mantle. Honestly i think im rolling with elder wizards just due to the +15 or so more int.
---
It's the same guy who wanted to create the neckbeard dictator server.
---
One of us.
---
Beta access? You think you do, but you don't.
---
Good good but isn't that too many raids and dungeons? The game looks like retail: designed by raider who forgot everything else. I suggest mixing just small none instanced dungeons, more depth to professions (both gathering and crafting) in open world and dungeons, more quests (and especially long quest chains) and zone unlocks. Then there are some raids and dungeons. Raiding was very very small part of vanilla and the balance shouldn't be shifted too much towards that.
---
Messing with the open-world and contained chaos that was Vanilla WoW really kills the atmosphere imo. On top of that layering creates very obvious problems or at the very least questions that need to be answered (because they greatly affect the results of Classic) 
---
You guys have probably seen the video with the method guy flipping between layers to farm his Arena chest? That same method can be used to also farm rare spawns (Nazjak’s Tidal Charm comes to mind) and herbs like Black Lotus - which are meant to have 1 spawned at a time in each zone..
---
With multiple layers at least in the 30+ zones, stuff gets really weird really fast. Without preventative measures it seems like people like @Elsdyret are willing to throw the games economy and atmosphere in shambles just to have a smooth 1-30 experience...
---
I don’t care what Blizzards behind the scenes say, if they have answers they could kindly explain the questions we have about how this affects the game.
---
If I get into WoW Classic and people can phase around to avoid PvP, farm what used to be super rare materials (Ghost Mushroom / Black Lotus) and other bs things, I wont feel like this game is what Vanilla used to be.
---
WHY NOT USE THIS RING?????
---
Humar the Pride Lord
---
This place needs 666 upvotes to remind people that its evil and is waiting to make you cry
---
Because it will remove some of the incentive to be social. If you know it's hard to find a group, you'll invest more in making friends/guild so it will be easier.
---
I feel like he's guilty of the very cynicism he blames here himself. Lots of people have been precisely right in their speculation about many things relating to Classic, for instance. Yes, there are always clueless loudmouths who are quick to blame the easy scapegoats, but public speculation is **not** always wrong. It's just often wrong.
---
Ah yes, the typical "unpopular opinion" that gets top rating in the thread.
---
Try playing hunter. Then you will learn about complex
---
My replies are based on OP saying that the quote inspired them to rethink their reaction to layering.
---
&gt;[He even complimented the players and said they had very intelligent arguments](https://i.imgur.com/CthsdOw.png)
---
...that he calls wrong. He straight up says the arguments are wrong, with a strong implication that the only way to be correct is to be privy to what is said within Blizzard's walls. That is textbook discrediting in my eyes, especially, as I said earlier, because we have to actually play within these systems. You're saying that *I* didn't understand his point?
---
How is holy more efficient than shadow? Just wondering
---
This take me back. Used too think this was so funny and amazing....oh, wait still is. Thx for the post.
---
Wait is the premium WoW account the same thing as the Classic Battle Pass? Or is it the Ultimate Battle Pass Deluxe? I know one of them gives you the 10 consumable transmog tokens. Either way, it's not a huge deal because you can earn them in game - this is just an option for the people who want to speed up the process a little so I'm totally fine please kill me.
---
That's not bring vanilla back though, is it?
---
&gt;  No one wants to take 30 minutes trying to tag 8 boars at level 1
---
I'd rather spend the extra time tagging boars than living with the consequences of layering. I know this, because I did that on Nostalrius launch. The smart players will just group up and start grinding on level 5-6 mobs anyways.
---
&gt;and no one wants to end up on a server that’s dead in 4 months. 
---
Classic will not die in 4 months, these doomsday predictions are beyond ridiculous.
---
Well maybe that public perception wouldn't be so strong if you weren't so secretive and disconnected from your customers ¯\\(ツ)/¯
---
They stopped playing Old AV because honor was too low. That is why Blizzard changed old av.
---
Some special pets are better than others, aka broken tooth. Lupos is Physical, there are no pets with special damage types. Pets are not normalized, so they have different attack speeds.
---
Yeah I'm a drummer and I learned to play the drums on a right hand setup (and still play it that way). It probably made learning a little more difficult at first but it didn't take long before it felt more natural. Point being I get what you mean about strengthening your weak hand.
---
Good point! Never thought of a connection there.
---
I’m in charrrge here!
---
Good bot
---
Have no moneys.  Am dead.
---
IIRC, if you die at various points in the unknown zone, you'll warp into Moonglade. At others, you'll go to Darkshore, Winterspring or Azshara. If you miss all of them, you'll go to your faction default graveyard (Westfall for Alliance, not sure for Horde.)
---
What boss is gonna say that if you're sick, you can't play video games? It doesn't take a ton of effort.

Hah joke’s on you, I never moved out of my moms house.
---
Dang that's impressive! I feel like it would be quite a large amount of work... Heck my left handed writing sucked until I was a high schooler IIRC. Well certainly don't need full strength for clicking a mouse 🤣
---
Need more warlock
---
Sorry! It'll bug you. Can't be unseen
---
Surely
---
You say that like add-ons weren't present in vanilla.
---
After the first 4 years of world of warcraft, no game make me feel the waya wow did. Will be glad to relive it once again. Games nowdays are depressing reskin on reskin.
---
I've never seen a bigger shit show. Battlefront 2 and Anthem were huge, but most of the community was in sync there, where hardly anyone gives a shit about the Pokemon issue. The saddest part is that the Pokemon community as a whole is over 15 million+ strong and only ~50k people give a shit about the Pokedex fiasco right now, yet they think they are a powerful majority and that everyone is behind them.
---
Mage. I've seen modestly geared mages wreck face because their class is all about control.
---
Anyone created like a National Guard guild? To hold certain areas from gankers? Protecting the ppl lvling there? Or any pvp guilds doing this stuff?
---
They totally do! Maybe that's why I like playing orcs when I player healers...
---
You first
---
Mage for aoe clears.
---
Warlock for some solo dungeon runs.
---
&gt;Cata is just the worst of all addons imho..
---
To be fair, I'd rather play Cata instead of BfA until Classic comes out.
---
I also thought that movie was pretty great. Maybe having super low expectations helped but I thought it was pretty much as good as a Warcraft movie could be.
---
This guy raids!
---
Great post and a lot of obvious effort put into the post. Seasonal realms such as cycled resets could help validate the new raids as horizontal progression too as they launch and change the end game meta leading up to their launch along with unique set bonuses
---
Teamaker, a resto shaman on darksorrow eu.
---
I’m not sure people today understand how many teenagers that threw away their life’s at World of Warcraft back in 2005. 
---
I had a ton of friends back then that basically dropped out of school for WoW and now 15 years later they still haven’t recovered.
---
I found him off someone making a similar post a couple weeks ago looking for a priest player on Beta and I've become a fan. I don't love that he's more focus on being a Spriest than a healer priest but it doesn't mean his content is bad or anything ridiculous like that. Just that I wish there were more healer insight stuff. But yeah he's a solid Priest and PVP Player.
---
Ooo, I'll write this down.  I know a lot of folks with Stikinass Syndrome.  Between the churches and the safe spaces, there are many victims to attend to.
---
If you don't like it, don't play it.  
---
I've been playing vanilla emulators for the better part of six years. To each their own.
---
Classic will not die in 4 months, but certain servers definitely will without layering. This will not be nostalrius where everyone is on the same server, and the server populations are going to be way smaller from the beginning.
---
Everytime I've tried to watch his stream he's playing some FPS. Literally can never seem to find him playing wow. Unless I'm getting Hydramist mixed up with a different streamer?
---
They *are* wrong. He said they are wrong in that they don't know WHY Blizzard are making the decisions since they lack all the information related to it. He is calling people who say "Blizzard is only making this change for more money" wrong, when the actual reason they made a change was because of a completely different reason. 
---
He isn't saying people are wrong in their ideas or possible solutions to these problems, just in their understanding of why Blizzard is making said changes. Can you... like... not read very well?
---
Aimed shot was always a 3 second cast in vanilla.
---
I've thought about this. I think John is a rare, brilliant, and flawed guy and I love that he put this in his book even though I don't agree with it. His willingness to be honest and open seems a symptom of being a genuine and earnest dude. I think that people like him are the ones who do great things because they'll tell their coworkers to do better and then they'll stay at work late to get something right, all to satisfy the principle of getting something right.
---
Log in queues. Enough said.
---
&gt; There are, but they are opt-in 
---
Literally the definition of a PvE server.
---
&gt;I am drawn to classic with ideas of playing the game "before it was perfectly balanced".
---
When did they perfectly balance the game? Every iteration of WoW I've played has been horribly imbalanced. 
---
​
---
I was  very impressed when I first saw it. Didn’t have much expectation and now I’m dying to see another one
---
Your entire post history is you being uninterested or upset about anything and everything. 
---
There is nothing you enjoy since you always look for the faults.
---
thank you, a lot.
---
It's a dangerous business, /u/BabyMakerBaker6, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.
---
Why do you feel that birth control is only for women to do and not men?
---
Honorable question! Idk 🙈
---
I remember a night elf druid named Jast who terrorized the crossroads. He was a legend to horde players.
---
Do you actually need to put "c" and "z" in current wow ?
---
I've always just typed /who warrior ironforge 
---
And it worked
---
Leveling 1-60 is a very important experience in vanilla WoW. You slowly gain your skills, and have time to experiment and learn how to use them. If you jump into 60 without that knowledge, you're guaranteed to be overwhelmed.
---
You basically jumped into a pro Counterstrike tournament while being a first time player of the game. Actual Classic WoW is going to be a much friendlier experience, since there will be a lot more inexperienced players for you to match against. Until you gain experience, of course you're going to get dominated by the pros.
---
Deadzone is further away, not smaller. It's a huge disadvantage.
---
Sick. I’ve never seen the ship fron this angle!
---
yeh godtier pve dmg but hf pressing 1 button per raid 😂
---
upgrading troops, summoning faction boss, destroying towers, doing pve camps for supplies, killing wolves/rams for supplies,
---
Only usual caster offhands, dual wielding is a class specific talent for warriors and rogues and hunters
---
The ranged shooting animation is horrible on them though.
---
Now it’s just a matter of choosing my class due to the commitment!! I felt in BFA, no matter what I chose there was a solid balance, it just came down to what I would have fun on most... I cannot deny that I want to top charts in PVP in Classic but will I ever if I don’t take the extra time to gear up with raids?
---
Also I noticed there is no “damage done” in BG
---
The biggest downside is Hunter is the only class that cost gold to do dps.  Ammo costs and the loss of 1 bag really suck.
---
Is there a prenup involved?
---
It's early to say, but so far the way they're handling classic has been good IMO. That encourages me to give them a little trust again.
---
Whats Stranlethorn?
---
If you post something like this do it right
---
If you have servers launch at about 6k players, and you experience a population drop of 50% (which is massive, if you consider new people will be rolling there too) then you still have 3k players on that server. I don't really consider that to be dead.
---
And even if that somehow happens, a server merger or two is preferable to layering.
---
PvP or something like PvP servers need you to opt in before you engage, basically making every server PvE servers. The feature was added in BfA, called Warmode.
---
So many betas in the comments
---
We'll DC has Superman, so probably DC.  Supes is pretty OP.
---
I had hope then, that useless lump of shit.
---
mind blown
---
He was batting above his average with that girl anyway.
---
Ya I just wasnt sure. I cant remember that far back very well since I was only 13 years old and I mained a warlock. Honestly I was pretty sure that they couldn't but the fist weapon I didnt know at all. Saw an awesome 4 piece set while browsing items on classic wowhead in which 2 pieces are a main hand and off hand fist weapon. It's probably more for fury warriors and honestly it sounds like a precursor to the monk class because the set bonus gives you a chance to summon a tiger for 2 minutes to fight by your side lol.
---
All in all I'm just trying to find a weapon to make feral druid not suck at 60 without farming 100 manual crowd pummelers per week.
---
Im torn between upvoting for the awesome cake, or downvoting for the alliance.
---
I wish they kept the interactive objectives and tied a significant % of the honor points if winning to a actually using the objectives available to you in the battleground. So, zerg win = reward X, win using objectives = reward X*(significant bonus factor).
---
Yeah, but the scoreboard is pretty meaningless in BGs anyways.
---
There are no bad classes in vanilla, but there's definitely some bad specs. So it takes a little bit of knowledge and research to avoid picking one of those.
---
You'll sometimes run into gear disadvantages (especially in later content), but you can still compete without raiding.
---
Can a guild be named a phrase that long? Would be fun to run around with that!
---
Ah yes. Because things aren't working out for you then something must be wrong with EVERYONE ELSE.
---
You sound like the people I get in my Dota 2 games who cry about smurfs on the enemy team.
---
Or the people in ny city who can't land a job because they have no networking skills.
---
No matter what happens in life you can alwayd count on a shitter to make excuses about why things don't work out for them. And its never their fault.
---
AV is fine, organised groups can clear it in like 15mins and when it's a pug it turns into a huge shitshow. Exactly what you want.
---
Priests can aoe farm, with Holy nova they can do DM runs
---
Mage, hands down. 
---
Warlock is good though. Priest is meh.
---
Errrrrmmmm? Wat
---
healing in classic is a breeze dont worry to much. Do a few dungeon when you llvl and you can easily heal molten core when 60.
---
Beautiful
---
Alliance side, it's warlock. On horde side fury warriors can make more use of axe drops from raids so they will have an easier time than fury warrs on alliance.
---
Auchindoun was based off of.... Auchindoun
---
I have was in the Monument Valley around 10 years ago, magnificent place
---
15 a month baby
---
How do you guarantee something that's wrong lol. In the blue post about itemization they literally said loot will be added into the game in the patch/phase it was implemented back in Vanilla.
---
we need an expert here
---
WL = Hunter &gt; Mage in OW solo pvp
---
but Mage stronger / more versatile in BGS and Skrimishes
---
If you show me yours first. Let's compare scars I'll tell you who's is worse.
---
I'd say a population of 6k to start is an overestimation. If they're hard on #nochanges, servers would start at a 2500 cap.
---
The problem with merges is that people have to change names, guilds have to change names and the merged server will have no meaningful history up to that point. I'd say thats worse than layers merging.
---
&gt;pressing 1 button per raid
---
that pretty much describes 90% dps specs in vanilla
---
My final semester starts 3 week before classic releases. I was hoping it'd either be out early June (ie now) and I'd get some time to play the hell out of it before semester OR get delayed.
---
Guess I'll just be a casual and only play a few hours a week. I probably won't even be close to 60 before December.
---
Well they won't be in until phase 3 which means probably not until something like 6-8 months after launch. Sad times.
---
yep i have the same lol
---
I actually googled that and I feel like an idiot
---
agreed

If it makes you feel any better I got over it so fast. The AVs go on for hours with turtles and it's 58 with mediocre blues and poor gear attribute selection from the devs. Seriously it's lame I wish I could skip to Monday to get back on the beta. Although even that's boring now cause they're testing layering so there's no horde anywhere. Every zone is empty with mobs only.
---
Please sift through my history and find post vehemently in favor of it, please!
---
I'm against people making assumptions based on nothing and we really don't know anything about what goes on behind closed doors at Blizzard
---
Sorry to break it to you, but most players will prefer a game system with proper incentives over one that is simply supposed to be "fun", especially in the long run.
---
Just how it is.
---
5 Man dungeons, or pre made battle grounds are good ones. Getting a buddy and doing farming
---
Even some of the starting quests you need to group up with people in classic, it's a very social game or at least was back in the day, game is somewhat slow you can actually chat with people while questing, one of my more fond memories of wow is due this fact
---
Wow that’s actually quite impressive considering the drop rate, I think I ran that instance over 100 times and never saw it, the drop rate is like 1/10000
---
And improved sprint like i said, and you get 2% hit when you go for the sprint talent also
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't all the turn ins possible, but not repeatable - like for reputation farm at level 60?
---
Please let me know where they have said that they most definitely will be filling each layer to the brim. One layer can fit a whole server, but is that their intention? My car can fit 5 people and 3 in the trunk, that doesn't mean I fill it with 8 people each time I go out.
---
Meanwhile, I’m scrambling to trick a girl into hanging out with me on the regular now, so that she’s somewhat emotionally attached to me when classic wow comes out and I become a colossally fat piece of shit.
---
Gotta play that 500 iQ game.
---
The biggest issue with that is that ppl stopped playing. Yes we had AV's lasting days (longest one i remember on the servers i played back then was like 3 days), however less and less ppl started doing AV, making is harder and harder to even start one after a while. Ppl got their rep to exalted and then just stopped signing up for AV because of no rewards.  
---
If Blizzard hadn't changed AV, atleast on my servers it would have been dead. A lot of ppl cared about the "low honor", they would just go do other PVP content for rewards and never bother with AV anymore.
---
Try playing classic EverQuest. By the time you reach level 10, you can't kill another creature around your level without the help of other players.
---
Yes, it's almost like it needs some more testing! If only we had a beta going on so they can tweak in before launch.
---
Lol when they appear behind venruki ”watch ye back mon” and disappear into shadows
---
You faced Ragnaros and survived.  
---
You faced Illidan and survived.  
---
You faced Arthas and survived.  
---
You faced Deathwing and survived.  
---
You faced motherfucking Garrosh and survived.  
---
You faced Archimonde and survived.  
---
You faced Argus the Unmaker and survived.  
---
Even if you didn’t deliver the final blow in every encounter you can’t expect to be treated like a nobody forever.
---
Writing ain’t gonna happen either haha, but normal non complicated acts is quite easy.
---
Ever tried that tennis ball thing with ball tied to a pole? Play solo and start there; it works if you’re stuck with no tv at your grandparents before the internet became a thing 😂
---
"No u"
---
Miggers, obviously.
---
This is pretty well done tbh
---
Does blizzard have any positions for someone dumb as dirt?
---
Standing Desks?
---
Compared to retail wow, it should be very multipayer. You will need each other to fight in dungeons ,raids, quests and even zone bosses mobs. But there are no tools to find groups, your will have to be social or find a guild.
---
Lvling is very slow in classic, you will meet a lot of people beceause they will be in the same zone for a long time. 
---
Sorry for my english :)
---
get a desk to stand, a desk to sit and alternate between them if each option alone causes you pain.
---
Yeah, by playing a lot he's going to get his mother depressed.
---
Same
---
At least trolls have their own capital city, unlike gnomes.
---
play hunter or mage and you'll get your epic mount in a day or 2 of heavy farming.
---
Hate this guy
---
The way I see it there's no way for Blizzard to win when it comes to layering.
---
Damned if they do, Damned if they don't.
---
So they are going with the solution that will make Server merges not needed in the worst case.
---
Exactly what i have been looking for, thank you very much
---
There are only 3 reasons not to go troll.
---
Druid
---
Warlock
---
Alliance
---
Boomkin can do it with moonfire spam and a weapon faster than 1.5s like a dagger. The weapon swing timer is triggered on successful completion of a spell.
---
I know, right? For some of us, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. A great escape from the darkest turn of my life.
---
Then dont play lol
---
If you haven't got much time to play, you probably arent even going to reach rank 10.
---
The amount of players foreseeing themselves getting to rank 10-14 casually is insane.
---
If only there was a simple way of having people not misunderstand your intentions.
---
Or you can simply GTFO and not play the game you entitled cry baby
---
There's no way you're only level 9 after doing all available quests. You must have missed something(and possibly also avoided fighting literally any mob on the way to quests and back)
---
because w/ holy, you have higher damage per mana talents. More holy talents focus on increasing dps while shadow is on utility, pvp, range, and hit until later on. Mind Flay is weak until later on, and Mind Blast is less efficient than talented Holy Fire/Smite.
---
I have taken you up on your offer, only then to discover you make a habit of vehemently discouraging any and all criticism and even conversation of anything remotely critical of the current direction the Blizzard team is going. Enlightening.
---
Personally, I think speculation is good, I think an abundance of caution is good, and yes I certainly think allowing people the freedom to express their goddam opinions on an open forum is a good thing.
---
You just had to ruin it with that ugly bird huh
---
Lol jk looks tastey
---
Jokes on you, I don’t have a house or a wife! And I never moved out
---
*“PVE is boring because I can’t one shoot players 15 levels bellow mine.“*
---
Season 10 and 15
---
No it's not.
---
Some games have a scaling system come with it. Depending on the severity of the balance the incentives increases for example:
---
65:35 = increased exp + and Rep
---
75:25 = the ones mentioned above + increased gold and honor
---
85:15 = the ones mentioned above + no flight costs +  less repair costs
---
90:10 = the ones mentioned above + free respeccing
---
My guess was Indiana Jones.

As DustTheHunter said I’m talking about his mannerisms and tone nothing to do with his opinions. I’m not hate mongering, I’m just voicing my opinion on why he’s copying Asmon. I wish more streamers were their real selves, it’s hard to watch fake people.
---
Uber eats and postmates are going to need more drivers come August.
---
I'm starting a new job in mid July...
---
Um, I thought mara farm only consists of tinkerer, princess and croc? I mean I never understood why landslide is left out, but I assumed that his stun and damage make it inefficient for farming. Care to elaborate?
---
Mid fight on Sartura FD on hunter and rez a healer which enabled the first kill!
---
Now I feel a little guilty.   I'm making my wife run through the wetlands to meet me.
---
We know better than you. And here it is, Retail.
---
I can already hear "she's too fat for me" playing in the background.
---
This is the best dagger spec with improved sprint:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbe0ohZGcMbbZVMjcc0R](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbe0ohZGcMbbZVMjcc0R)
---
I've gotten rank 10 when I played vanilla so I know how long it would take and I'm using that as a reference because I don't see myself playing any more than that.
---
Some private servers actually just spawn gold for the sellers and take cuts of the profits, it's a lot different.
---
Yeah I don't think the C and Z are necessary.
---
doesn't that depend on the amount of servers they release on launch?
---
* if 2? most likely
---
* if 155? probably not
---
I passed it too. With it being on a curve the whole time and more people leveling faster and trying to achieve the prestige I think itll be a rough ride.
---
r/ihadsex
---
I much prefer classics combat. Complexity for complexities sake isn't what I like. I'd much rather have simple mechanics and abilities, just like old school runescape.
---
Well beta has been out for a while and we see the glaring issues now. Its time for serious changes to the layering system or WoW Classic is going to be far from WoW Vanilla..
---
God damn
---
I too want answers!
---
Oh man I used to always do this! People would join and be like, how’d you find me? And I’d tell them I just /who’d a certain level bracket and chose the best picks for my group and asked lol
---
It only drops target but if a projectile is on the way it doesn’t absorb the damage. You can’t Fd a death coil for example.
---
I’m not saying they need to stop streaming. Can you tell me how much money they are losing playing on a pve realm? 
---
Seems to me like a reasonable cost benefit analysis would be in order for their business. Getting camped is a cost in a pvp realm. Do they lose more money getting camped repeatedly and losing viewers for being terrible at pvp, or do they lose more money on a pve realm playing it safe? 
---
It’s not victim blaming if they aren’t victims. You don’t even need to steam snipe to camp them. If I found a recognizable streamer running around the world I would definitely camp them until they log (unless it’s kala, bless his soul) and tune into their stream just to watch some baby rage. You don’t need to stream snipe to ruin their stream.
---
Just giving away your position isn’t that big of a deal. The other party still has to actually beat them in pvp. If they don’t want to pvp there are other realms that better suit their playstyle.
---
At least you’ve conceded that it’s not cheating.
---
Sharding is on an area or zone basis but layering is the entire continent / world.. if you want to nitpick.
---
Wow, I didn't expect it to  be that big of a difference. I thought between the extra procs of lifestealing and the weapon proc, which you don't have on mcp (well, you could put lifestealing on mcp, but such an expensive enchant for a 90sec potion?) and the increased white dps would make a fairly close gap. Also, going by the prebis dps-tests posted on the discord, it does look a lot closer, especially with ironfoe outperforming mcp at times.
---
What I'm most wonky about is SoR proccing stuff. Are you 100% sure, that this is the case on the classic server? My memory tells me, that in vanilla times SoR couldn't crit and couldn't proc any chance on hit stuff.
---
Haven’t you ever heard of a salaried position? It is 100% legal if you’re salaried over $44,000 a year. Good luck advancing your career if you don’t for a lot of jobs. That’s the corporate rat race  for you.
---
I played bc-Cata I never really understood what the hell was going on in av. I found it boring and not particularly fun
---
we have a hulk
---
I'm torn between a Night Elf Hunter with Herbalism/Alchemy class fantasy, sort of a Ranger of the Wild aesthetic. 
---
Or a Dwarf Hunter "Nesingwary" archtype with Engineering.
---
Warlock is you are intrested in 1v1 and duels.
---
Hunter if you are more the open pvp guy.
---
Mage if you want to do both and are sure you can do rank 10, but if you can do rank 10 i cant see why bwl/aq40 raiding should not be viable for you.
---
Keep tank selected and hot then heal when theyre at about half health. Earlier if the mobs are hitting hard. 
---
If the tank dies it's your fault. If you die it's the tanks fault.
---
If the dps dies it's probably their fault but it may be the tanks.
---
We might not have humor, but at least we have hygge here. And from the rumours, we also have a lot of self owned pastry shops.
---
I just don't like speculation based on no info, and I especially dislike people that pull random numbers out from nowhere, like the people who says that "we know that server populations will be around 15k" and upwards to 25k, based on nothing.
---
Discussions are good if they are anchored in reality, which these more often that not, aren't.
---
What are you lookin at Fatty? *Moonkin noise* Boomkin Piece of Sh-
---
I think people on this subreddit overestimate the amount of players classic will have. After the first few months I expect it'll fall into a more niche interest and servers will somewhat stagnate. 
---
Of course I could be (and would love to be) wrong, but I personally wouldn't hold my breath for more servers being necessary.
---
The flatlands were based of central zealand. Not a hill in sight
---
If it's EU Alliance im so up for it!
---
Not big enough
---
&gt; I'd rather spend the extra time tagging boars than living with the consequences of layering.
---
But that's you. There's plenty of fans who would also happily wait in queues for hours to log on, or at the very least grudgingly tolerate it. They are not the majority however. Casual players, who have always been the majority in WoW, expect to be able to log on and play the game whenever they like, which is honestly a completely reasonable viewpoint. They are paying for the product after all. 
---
And we need those players. Because if only the diehard fans are left, we'll have trouble filling a single server. You might well point to Nostalrius, but using private server numbers to gauge Classic support is fraught with problems for the very simple reason that private servers were, and are, free. Classic on the other hand costs a monthly subscription. Plenty of people will gladly play something for free, but ask them to cough up cash and they'll baulk. 
---
&gt;Classic will not die in 4 months, these doomsday predictions are beyond ridiculous.
---
He didn't say Classic. He said servers. And he's absolutely right; if Blizzard just opened up a pile of servers, most of them would be dead after a couple of months, because there are going to be a heap of retail players checking out Classic who probably won't stick with it. They very well might love it, and I'd love them to stay, but let's face facts; the two games are very different at this point and if they enjoy retail, they probably won't enjoy Classic to the same level. People hated server merges back in vanilla days, because they liked their server communities and didn't want them to go away.
---
Nope it's still messed up, but the things you specifically mentioned wanting to do are still able to be done.
---
That feeling when you think that girl not liking you is the worst thing that can happen to you, so you fall in to crumbling depressive state and grind wow 12 hours per day...  
---
Adulthood, bills, kids, debt:   HOLD MY BEER  
---
Still gonna play classic tho &lt;3
---
kudos to anybody who aspires to become a rank 14 in vanilla. I just pray your grind is less than 12 hours a day and you can live a little. No title or status in a game is worth that much investment, and i'm a title and prestige freak. i will hit rank 12-13 max at one point, and that's about that.
---
It's an interesting system for sure, but definitely not a good one.
---
Shield block 100% uptime &gt; Revenge  &gt; Shield Slam &gt; Sunder &gt; Heroic Strike/cleave.
---
That said if you're in battle/zerker stance you and have crusader you can weave hamstrings in to fish for Crusader procs, or weapon procs in general.
---
you didn't even need to use them in vanilla, only extremely minor problem is if there's a mage called warrior in ironforge, he'd show up if you type /who warrior ironforge.
---
Notice how he gave no examples or explanations?
---
It's horseshit.
---
That's the kind of zone I love in MMO's. Just a little  piece of land stuck between a moutain and the sea. It's not important and there might be not much to do, but it's there !
---
Ok bye bye then. Important post.
---
I'd think 25-40 servers would be a healthy amount with them releasing 2-3 new servers every 5 or so months but combining smaller 'release' servers within the same time period.
---
Yeah that's not an argument. Blozzard hasn't exactly demonstrated that they know shit about what's going on either.
---
I have three under 10. Also have a 90 lb. German Shephard and a 4 month old puppy - at this point in time I think it'd just end up being giant purple elephant balls after they get trampled.
---
That was a Jolly to watch !
---
"But... I have a D cup!"

Poor mama
---
Crazy.. I knew about the sudbury mines, but I had no idea it was hit by a meteor long ago.
---
I'm leaving it
---
Thanks!
---
best
---
That was always pretty much complete bullshit, and even if it were true, *forcing people to create and maintain relationships they wouldn't otherwise bother with* because they need roles for dungeons is shitty to begin with.
---
If you can be troll you pick troll. Simple as.
---
If nothing else, I felt Jolly watching him.
---
Oh, alright. Thanks alot for the answer :)
---
To my knowledge, any spells will do it. It's why Paladins want to use Judgement immediately after a swing.
---
BC was perfect, it doesn't need redesign.
---
you could classify anything that doesn't exist as bullshit
---
This cake isn't a viable flavor.
---
Mages and rogues, especially horde side. Tank threat is still a bit of a unknown with all the differences being discovered from private servers so we might not be able to go all out like we're used to in which case classes with threat reduction grow stronger.
---
That’s one method of refusing to admit saying “raid” constitutes an idea
---
Plot twist: We actually ended up winning this game, despite them having this immortal priest on their team.
---
Honestly that quote is, in my opinion, just a really bad way of phrasing "Nostalgia makes games seem better than we remember, and we don't want to take the monetary risk on Vanilla out of fear that it applies here as well."
---
I think a lot of people interpret it as him saying "We know what you like better than you do." Which would rightfully be something to get annoyed over.
---
You get 398 honor and 50 rep
---
The feels...
---
Accurate, what did you bathe in ballsweat?
---
You won't be getting 5cps from backstab alone in pvp either. You'll get 2 from ambush/CS, 1 from backstab, 1 from gouge and the fight won't be over. A clothie will now be at around 1/4 health (with a bit of luck), and a plate wearer will be somewhere over half. Those extra CP and energy regen from those two talents are critical to continuing the fight with extra effectiveness.
---
Let's send every bum who can paste some icons on a map to blizzard to design games. We all know how good wow turned out.
---
Never heard soda complain about these guys
---
I was watching an after for nearly 5 hours and then tuned out ... was fun to watch but man these things take forever !
---
People still enjoy bgs and open world pvp in vanilla. I have played occasionally on private servers since emerald dream, through nost and its follow-ons. Never any shortage of people queuing for bgs or fighting in the world.
---
That's why Classic is happening.
---
I love everything youre doing, very entertaining to think about. 
---
But, and I dont think its you, I dont want these Kalimdor zones to exist. The Verdant Reach should be a mountain as it is on retail--the vast topographical differences between Feralas, 1k Needles, Un'Goro (separate Geology), and Silithus dont make a lot of sense given their proximity. A giant mountain splitting the zones from eachother begins to make some sense out of it all.
---
Further, I just fucking hate Uldum. Really dont think it fits well and feels like a shoe horn of Egyptian esq. lore into the game for really not reason.
---
Anyhow, keep doing it.
---
Props! I work minimum 50 hour weeks on 3rd shift with three kids, it's pretty much sapped any interest in my hobbies or normal stuff I used to do. I'd like to say I'll play classic, but I'll probably just end up watching it streamed and sleep.
---
like minded friends!?!
---
My entire heart is breaking. :( What a shame.
---
I'd be really curious to see how you would have a Emerald Dream zone, it was like half way done before scrapped in vanilla, incase you run out of ideas and want a big project as there is no over veiw and it would almost be completely from your self. But I think everyone on this sub would love to see it!
---
Oh? So you know all that's going on at Blizzard? Can you enlighten us then?
---
Ahh home. 
---
Server 6, Layer 8, Mulgore. 
---
Someone yells: Inv me to the Asmangold layer.
---
Yea this was super fked up lol blizz knows what they did
---
serious question - are you still in awe when looking at thunderbluff after 10 years? when I was playing vanilla (12 or 13 years old) everything seemed so exciting and cool to me, now playing a PS after 10 years of no vanilla I am not as excited about things anymore. i feel like the 'novelty' falls off.
---
*/who warrior ironforge* can end up giving false results such as a priest called *Warriorlol* or a guilde name called *Ironforge Hooligans*
---
Server merges would be vastly preferable to me if they were planned ahead of time. That would allow the player base to experience Vanilla-like servers with the same player base logging in every day. Layering is basically 20,000 active players (or whatever number they decide on) on a mega server that gets split up into layers (that will contain different people tomorrow).
---
In the end layering is only for 6-8 weeks. So the people who think it's a huge problem should just wait until the world bosses are released to start playing.
---
If this makes you rethink, then you are easily manipulated.
---
Yes. Don't worry that someone stabbed you, only worry about *why* they stabbed you. And then realise you're wrong and it's totally OK that they stabbed you.
---
I respect your position. But I think it seems obvious that more people are interested in a run of classic 2019-2021 and then either BC or new content after than there are people who simply want to repeat classic wow nochanges forever. 
---
That said, I absolutely think a repeating no changes server should exist, forever. And it should repeat itself--restarting every 3 years and relegating all characters to a single Naxx released world. 
---
Ideally we get #noChanges classic restarting every 3 years. then after this 2021 run we get a separate classic next server. Be it CTBC or  classic+.
---
Ultimately Blizzard wants to maximise monthly subs. I think a single iteration of classic in 2019 brings in the most people. But imma be 32-33 when classic finishes its run. I don't play retail, I wont play classic a 3rd time. If blizzard wants my sub--and they do--they need to do something.
---
You forgot ret applies won’t be good
---
Need context here
---
Bro thats beautiful. Boomkins didn't get enough live during Vanilla.
---
The violent outburst were the best part!
---
&gt;  but most were early 20s to early 30s.
---
*waves*
---
I was 34 for vanilla wow
---
all you whippersnappers can get off my lawn.
---
Ew, it's blue and you spelled Horde wrong, jk happy birthday.
---
I totally get you about watching the streams. I hardly have the energy to crawl to the comp, because the moment wow launches a kid will wake up
---
No that's a mistake. Discussions in the hypothetical are extremely useful. "If X then Y," is still a productive form of thinking. If it weren't, many many industries would not exist.
---
Sounds like we need multiple guilds, sign me up for EU Horde :)
---
But the pink is awesome!
---
Shamans appear pink in group frames in classic.
---
babies have more hair than asmon
---
In lore it was.  The Tolvir destroyed it fighting the Mogu.
---
I'm sad I still haven't been invited for anything.
---
I'm sorry :( 
---
I guess I don't have much room to complain. &gt;.&lt;
---
Watch documentaries, not Hollywood movies.
---
My friend who got into beta was worried ques would be way to long I'm assuming that is the case?
---
Ironfoe is simming weird. We dont know its proc rate, some versions of the sheet have 5% or 10%. It's a weapon that looks like it could be good, but we genuinely don't know. If it is perticularly amazing, its better on Warrior than it is Paladin. Ironfoe has been a major point of contention, we simply dont know if it will be good or not. 
---
SoR procs on hit effects, but can't crit. You get more crits by attacking fast. In the same time you can get 1 slow hit in, you can get 3 MCP hits in. By virtue of attacking three times as fast, you give yourself three times the chances to proc vengeance. Even a weapon like Jackhammer will be attacking twice as fast as a 3.4. By attacking quickly, you simply give yourself more chances to crit.
---
There is this dry salted land north of Tanaris, can't remember the name.
---
Based on the great salted lake I guess, there is even the speed race wich is a real life event.
---
Yes, I have advocated for this since the demo. Hopefully they fix it
---
What does AV stand for?
---
It was fine earlier today when the realm first went live. But, as the day has progressed, it's slowly gotten longer, and longer, and longer. I'm sure it has something to do with the time zones. However, I feel like some people are very driven on progressing through the normal realms in the beta that they can't be assed with playing the AV test. They play a couple games and call it a night.
---
I, however, really enjoy AV. I don't mind this, especially since it's only for the weekend.
---
And chat and guild list and so on and so on
---
The games called The Lost Vikings and the characters would have to be a hunter (Olaf), a rogue (Erik) and a warrior (Baelog).
---
I don't want to assume anyone's motives, but it really feels like Blizzard has a strange obsession with "NEW." 
---
They revamp the entire system every two years and it gets worse and worse.
---
Me: Aesthetics over anything.
---
Dark Me: Roll a female Dwarf.
---
EU please!
---
not to get into a layering debate, but avoiding the combining of servers is what they say the whole point of layering is. with that in mind, don't you think it's more likely they err on the side of way fewer, like maybe a dozen? since each one can hold multiple servers' worth of players (with each servers' worth getting their own layer) your guess is probably right, but will actually end up being multiple layers of 10-12 servers
---
It's definitely better than the stink but I like being blue
---
The hardest road.
---
Is there anything inherently fun about only swinging once every 4 seconds and missing half the time anyway?
---
no but he suggested a blacklist that these guys would certainly be placed on
---
In what game?
---
They're immune while in shapeshift too. If you poly while they're in caster form then they can just pop a form. Idk why you wanna argue and downvote when you're the one way in the wrong buddy. Literally in the game since vanilla and on the tooltips for shapeshifting.
---
Married 9 years. You are loving the dream.
---
I'm planning to only play my Rogue as a party with a few mates. However, PPing will be a nice little addition to play solo when they're not on. Not getting xp means not leveling ahead of them and we're all still 'playing as a group' - just I'll be richer than them :)
---
No one cares about low level meta
---
Haha, OGN, excellent.
---
And? all servers had blacklists back in the day....
---
Ohhh, now that makes sense 😂
---
I don't play rogue but i feel you
---
You're being really weirdly antagonistic. It's weird, cut it off.
---
Im pretty sure the fan base is right a lot of times too tho
---
Appartment: bought 
---
Money: saved
---
Girlfriend: none
---
Yep, it's classic time
---
brutal... same for me.. was hyped for a few seconds.. way to jebait blizzard!
---
Sure but your dps will still drop like a rock (which was the point), because most of the best moonkin gear tends not to be hybrid.
---
Every village needs a village idiot.
---
Everyone is missing the point here. If they stop the rest of us (use your head, they don't care about streamers, it's a red herring) from \*wanting\* to play on their server, there won't be anybody to compete with and they're all but guaranteed world first ANYTHING. It's actually a very clever scheme used by dictatorships the world over.   
---
So I say EVERYONE play on their servers and utterly destroy their chances at world firsts. MUAHAHAHAHA!!!!
---
America funny, everyone else not, got'cha
---
Go for a mage hunter or lock if u dont have lot of time to pve

OG transmogs

I’m a Hipster douche, so I’ll be rolling a Dorf Hunner.

Yeah guilds are the whole point lol

Even if you cant play with all 3 accounts, you don‘t need to purchase the game. You just need an active subscription to play classic wow, nothing else.
---
Well i would agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong and whats the point in that?
---
I keep thinking that if we go down the road of Classic TBC, then Classic Wrath, we'll hit a dead end that we won't have a way out of.
---
Much better to open Classic+ servers (with a one-time character copy there) that would offer new content while leaving Classic Vanilla servers as they are.
---
Pretty sure devilsaur is a lot easier to get than BoE world drops. I got them without much problem on Nost at least. 150g maybe (don't remember the exact price). 
---
That's the sort of thing I would consider getting because it's *easier* than trying to get specific items from dungeons.
---
Just get your PvP pieces there instead if you have trouble getting gold (devilsaur isn't that expensive btw), since devilsaur is bad for that.
---
*free market capitalism
---
In Europe we have strong unions and government regulations, so working conditions are a million times better than in the US. Capitalism can be a lot better than that dystopian bullshit in the US if your country isn't corrupt as fuck
---
Have you maybe looked at those desks that you can raise to a higher height? You can swap between sitting down playing and playing while standing up.
---
Hope you figure this out mate, must be horrible to be in pain alot
---
 Mom, bathroom. Bathroom!
---
Heavily agreed
---
No he’s not. You can KILL him by shining a crystal at him. Even a baby could kill Superman. Fact.
---
So...play retail then. Clearly Blizzard got it all right. It must only be better.
---
People didn’t misinterpret it that way, that’s exactly what he meant. Nostalrius had already proved that people wanted to play vanilla, it was just arrogance on his part to still be writing it off as nostalgia at that point.
---
This bug happened few times already, if it happens in live game then I am curious how bad it could get abused.
---
I’m playing shaman on launch, right now I can’t decide what race to pick but this makes me want to roll Tauren.
---
Don't play classic then retard
---
Why are people incels for disagreeing with you? 🤔🤔🤔
---
No! Keep em coming. This is the best content we have right now. 
---
Plus, you're single-handedly getting a lot more people to hop on the Classic+ train!
---
Should really be Northern Plaguelands. Regardless, very cool.
---
What I mean is servers such as Bleeding Hollow, Stormreaver, etc.
---
The layers themselves will be eliminated (AFAIK) within a short time. I am positive that this would cause huge lag issues and such that the servers themselves won't be able to hold the amount of people.
---
People will generally be burned out or will be wanting to reroll to a fresh server due to various reasons and therefore they will more than likely release a new server every once in a while.
---
If the number is close to 2 million (or hell, even 500k is a huge number), they would need a LOT of layering per server. This would probably force them to start new servers depending if the servers can hold the amount of clients.
---
Well, that is actually a point. Today's Blizzard is more stupid than crowd without any knowledge. Thank you.
---
You do, /who warrior ironforge will get you general search results. Both words can be used as search filter for zone, name, guild etc.
---
Mage rank 10 gear is pretty good even for PvE beyond Molten Core.
---
Eskhandar proccrate seems very very low (pserver), and the stats are meh on the full set. Plus back then i can‘t remember anyone actually having all of it. 
---
The zg fistweapon set actually is pretty decent and has a funny procc 😄
---
This is fucking fantastic!
---
I really believe there should be progression about 6 months after the last planned patch of classic.
---
I mean, the things that ruined Vanilla was the loss of community/social interaction and overall loss of adventure. 
---
Therefore I would enjoy some new exciting content like this, still keeping it a non-flying-mount-game, no group-finder, no heirlooms. Just pure progression.
---
What else? When you are done with everything on your main; pvp and level alts? Feels like the game would slowly die out. They need to do something and I would much rather see this than BC tbh (although it was a nice expansion).
---
Great post!
---
Even then shit like that exists in classic lol look at warlocks with nightfall, putting up corruption waiting for an instant cast shadow bolt
---
I think this dude has a hard on for wow that isn't vanilla and for some reason decided to complain in a vanilla sub like a retard lol
---
Isn't allowed to?
---
Damn, I've bought fan art all the time. Especially at conventions, hell half the crap on Etsy seems to be fan art.
---
It's because different people have different interpretations of what "PVP" should be. It's a broad term that encompasses any interaction between players. You would prefer close or even fair fights, with both players having somewhat of a chance in battle. Other people do not share this view, and like to bring their boot down on opponents who have no chance of winning or fighting back, striking fear and frustration into the enemy. And there will be shades of grey between these two ways of playing as well.
---
Neither of these interpretations is wrong. They cannot be wrong, because they are things that are permissible under PVP game rules. They are simply different ways of playing the game. If you see these game rules as annoying or pointless, then a PVP server won't be for you.
---
A PVP server is NOT the same thing as having a server-wide battleground. Struggling through zones when you are at constant risk of getting 1-shot by level 60s, or when at low health, is part of the PVP server game experience.
---
You ask why people would kill a level 21 who is peacefully fishing? Because they find it funny.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc) 
---
To give you a personal view on my own actions on a PVP server - I happily accept that I can be killed at any time by anyone and I have made my peace with that. For my own actions - I personally tend not to kill any lowbies who walk past me, but I will make special raids or missions on enemy territory - for example, I will head to Redridge for a ganking session, and try to shut down the roads out of town to stop lowbies being able to quest. For me, this is what the horde should do - I'm invading alliance territory and killing my enemies. If they want to stop me, they have to gang up or call in level 60 friends.
---
LOK'TAR O'GA....... Oh what the hell - its cake! Happy b-day.
---
Flying mounts was the death of world pvp after max level.
---
Asmond isn’t banned, OP is saying his bro in law is banned from Asmondgold’s twitch.
---
You must be trolling. I know because troll is always the right choice.
---
Well makes sense since the majority time of wow shamans were blue! Thx man, gonna get it
---
Nature always finds a way
---
Capital City campaigns! Hell yeah, make the world leaders drop some good shit. 
---
This is a great post all around man, I'm a huge proponent of cut content and post naxx, I love your ideas.
---
Shimmering flats are generally just inspired by salt lakes, which exist all over the world. But in this case probably more specifically [Bonneville Salt Flats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonneville_Salt_Flats) due to the race track.
---
Same here, the salt is real ...
---
**Bonneville Salt Flats**
---
The Bonneville Salt Flats is a densely packed salt pan in Tooele County in northwestern Utah. The area is a remnant of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville and is the largest of many salt flats located west of the Great Salt Lake. The property is public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management and is known for land speed records at the "Bonneville Speedway". Access to the flats is open to the public.

Oof

There’s a reason for that... well multiple in fact... it starts with the skin...
---
I'm so disappointed they went with the 1.12 Alterac. Such a shame.
---
As in ”these guys killed me. Please, enemy faction, don’t let them raid”.
---
I like the concept idea, but frankly I personally feel like a Bloodsail/pirate-related hub would be better off using Plunder Isle and Bloodsail Hold.
---
Still a good concept, mind you. Could always be linked together too, maybe a ship that sails from Bloodsail Bay to Plunder Isle? Something like that?
---
Mage
---
I tried getting back in Retail WoW in Legion, i played 2 weeks and was fed up with this shit, i don’t get where this was a good expansion lol.
---
What is layering?
---
Heresy
---
I don't necessarily buy it. Reads like a PR piece from a company that we know to be pretty awful.
---
The biggest downside to playing warrior is they look... dumb. The mismatch of leather/mail/plate and needing a completely different set/build for pvp.
---
I think a lot of people who plan to go warrior are in for a surprise
---

---
Wasn't there a bug that existed that allowed you to get rep while in ghost form? I'm pretty sure I read about some people grinding Bloodsail rep this way somewhere, though I may be wrong.
---
So in theory, if this still exists in Classic, then a level 10 could potentially go to Bloodsail Bay. Or just have higher level friends carry them, which may have happened as well I think?
---
So, most players will prefer retail?
---
Why do they make the art have everyone wear tier1 armor when wveryone will just use the shitty looking bis armor? It ruins the immersion
---
Yeah the infamous brown af mulgore
---
Mage, but they are weak until you get them leveled up a bit.
---
Thunder Bluff has seen better days.
---
Also probably a retard
---
I really appreciate the work, and it seems very interesting. Although some patches seem more feasible then others, in addition to having varying degrees of groundwork already put in.
---
Ultimately - really cool, I for one would love to see more zones and raids unlocked overtime, in addition to seeing what Blizzard had in mind for Karazhan, Hyjal, Hellfire Penninsula, etc. But some of these ideas are a bit more of a stretch, and should be fleshed out more to compensate.
---
Everywhere needs a janitor?
---
Can't wait to see that beutiful princess again.
---
It's fine in everything except raids.
---
You *can* be a dps shaman in raids. But you will be getting completely carried. There are lots of guilds that will be happy to take you if you're a good player, because it's hard to fill raids sometimes, and content is not very challenging.
---
Well yeah but if you read the last part I'm not exactly making myself out to be a hero. Also IDC if classic wow Reddit viewers believe me or not.

Real shamans chat in pink
---
I only have 4 classes to choose from on launch, because I have it set in my heart that I’m rolling Tauren
---
&gt; Allow the player base to experience the joy of Vanilla-like servers
---
You mean the joy of Vanilla-like *private* servers, because the way actual Classic was, you definitely were not consistently seeing the same people every time you logged on.
---
&gt;over a constant, chronic ailment
---
TIL a few months is "chronic".
---
Yes you're correct.
---
But you have fear ward so you’re a dwarf priest and you could stoneform the serpent stings. Which is probably the play when there’s 3 of them on you, you’d probably be out of mana at the end of them.
---
The AV-beta is a little bit frustrating to sit out.. everyone who is in it can just try out all the specs and classes right now while we are just in the dark.
---
Yeah well done you press 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 better than the other guy.

Good romantic relationships aren't built on friendships. They're built on being more than friends. I've been with my wife 13 years and I only met her once before asking her out on a date.

PvP pieces in phase 1??
---
When I read that section, it seemed to suggest fan speculation being generally inaccurate as far as the *reasons why* Blizzard might do something, rather than whether fan consensus on the pros/cons *of* the feature itself are valid. 
---
There's two hangups here really. The first is that if there is withheld information relating to descisions, which Blizard does not want the fanbase to be aware of, it's probably information that would show their decision-making in an even more negative light. 
---
The second is that *the reasons don't matter*. The *result* is what the playbase has to contend with. It doesn't matter whether or not fans are wrong about the reasons *why* Blizard may have done X or Y, if X or Y negativly impact the game.
---
Implying I'm not piss ass drunk at every raid.
---
Hey dude you shouldn't really look at that it that way. Person needs to feel good and be able to be alone in order for other people to feel good around him. If you really have a desire to meet more people and not just to drink,party and get laid then find a way to go to the bigger city. Maybe your work is available there or even find something else. From your reply it seems that you are putting excuses on why you are lonely instead of finding solutions not to be.  Have a nice day
---
Truth be told, he is absolutely right.
---
Every freaking game today is p2w,
---
Anything where it involves being able to convert rl money into game currency.
---
Classic is not p2w, its play to win!
---
True savior of this depressing era.
---
How come the bot didn't reply to the first comment? IS IT IMPLYING GETTING AN EPIC MOUNT IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN RAIDING GUILDS?
---
WE ALL PLAY FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, RRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
&gt; I think a lot of people who plan to go warrior are in for a surprise
---
I think most people who plan to go fury dps are aware of the scuffed gear. 
---
Question is if most people who plan to go warrior realise that they will most likely have to raid as dps. I have a feeling a lot of the warriors either want to be tanks or mostly look at PvP and had not given PvE much thought.
---
On the other hand, I can imagine there was a reason for not getting through everywhere, for mountains in the landscape, too.
---
I did exactly this mid tbc after a burnout break. From warrior/rogue to SP/lock. It definitely reinvigorated the game for me. I never really got back into PvE in a hardcore but the pvp was a breath of fresh air after changing it up.
---
There's also \*\*g\*\* for guild and \*\*r\*\* for race filter.
---
If there is a real place like Teldrasil I ll go live there until I die.
---
Excellent question! Looking at this picture, I’d say it’s more good memories and nostalgia. But I feel like I’ll enjoy exploring again, having not played for so many years, and my last experience being Cata when everything changed,so it’s been a long old time since I saw the old world
---
You need something for those slots if you plan to PvP at some point. Devilsaur is not good at all.
---
Oh you sweet sweet child of summer
---
I guarantee you will have paladin tanks and druid healers in Classic... raids may even pressure druids into healing... the horror.
---
Yeah, bad decisions leading to bad games.
---
I'm prepared!
---
Forget about levels or honor, if you see a member of the opposing faction, assume they will attack you. The name is in the title: World of Warcraft.
---
I think that was changed to the movement speed based animation during Vanilla though.
---
Group btw
---
Great point :D
---
I just sit at the dungeon And spam chat lol
---
Guess you never took a [census](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/census.php). Their mod used a lot of those neat tricks to get less than 50 results per search, the maximum allowed by /who.
---
I'm not going to PvP and I would like to know what legs and gloves I'll use for PVE until I get devilsaur if no PvP gear is available yet.
---
I doubt it'll ever even make it to live.
---
What the hell is this
---
Generally good ideas, but it is always the same "a new threat emerges" thing. Story is better, if there are other reasons than threats, too. Maybe a positive thing to go somewhere in the first place. Like I said, nice ideas, but not filling up the whole story potential there is.
---
If you're just going to PvE I think you should just get devilsaur. Pick up whatever you find along the way, but don't go out of your way to get items that you will replace soon anyway. Devilsaur is not nearly as expensive as the epic BoEs.
---
Really cool concepts ! I can't point at much that id do differently, except maybe have the emerald dream be about an alliance between the cast out nelf Worgen and Xavius? 
---
Also, i think there should be more PvP patches - but im assuming your focus is on the PvE :)
---
I would personally love to see arenas in the game, but where you have to travel to the actual arena(s) to participate. Kind of try to recreate the spectator feeling you get from retails brawlers guild.
---
I think that instead of adding more bg's (besides the one you mentioned yourself), maybe try to create more open world PvP. One concrete way to do this could be by creating neutral NPC vendors/towns that the factions could battle for control of every, say, 6 hours. The faction who gains control of the town/vendors is able to obtain a limited amount of raid consumables or materials by trading in low-worth materials (could potentially change weekly which material would be tradeable, to try and stimulate the economy).
---
So no then, got it.
---
After much back and forth between pretty much every race/class combo there is I’ve decided to go NE fury warrior, as I did back in original vanilla. It was between this, a NE hunter or human priest really. Back in vanilla I managed to hit 60 a few months before TBC but never had the skill or confidence to go into raiding, but this time I plan on tanking and dps dungeons to get that awesome fury pre-raid gear which looks savage af. I want to experience raiding too and my end goal is drake talon pauldrons arms pvp cause it looks awesome and I wanna keep Hemet Nesingwarys camp safe from cows and boogers. The only thing I dislike about NE warrior is that the ally pvp gear doesnt fit the race and the AQ set which is bis looks ugly as hell. Looks might matter too much to me, but it’s gonna be fun!
---
You sadly can’t heal in Moonkin form
---
I have no problem spending 30 minutes tagging 8 boars. When you’ve played on the launch of private servers for years that’s something you expect and there’s nothing wrong with it. You’re either fast and good enough to get ahead or you aren’t. We don’t need this dumb ass layering technology at all honestly people are just complaining and whining because it’ll be too hard for them otherwise. Same reason why we have retail the way it is today. People complaining and crying over the years because it’s to hard now things are just handed to them.
---
It happens in vanilla PS so no reason why it won't happen in classic
---
Okay you're obviously not going to give me a real answer. Good bye /ignore.
---
Warrior &gt; Rogue &gt; Mage &gt; Hunter
---
This can vary on higher gear but not much diffrence.
---
War/Rog/Mage are usually in top if played right
---
Like you my view is the opposite to Mechanon84, dual wielding was the beginning of the end for how I played Shaman; Blizz pushed it more in that direction and totems became secondary at best over further expansions - I love totems...
---
It is maybe unfair to blame TBC, I did tank heroics with a team of dedicated (read idiots) who equally wanted to make it work (with the help of resilience, which was both a blessing and curse). Elemental became my \`main\` spec end of TBC-&gt;Wrath (well we all end up healing in raids like it or not eventually) and I did some great solo stuff Wrath but it was never the same. I prefer tanking and although the Shaman class had promise of it at the start, it was slowly stripped away with each expansion.
---
In classic I am looking forward to the mucking about aspect, I am in no way going to raid unless there are plenty of "dad guilds" who raid once a week for the hell of it. So Shaman is likely to become my main again with old friends who expect the shammytank to troll randoms again into submission that 'actually, that was possible'.
---
Sorry to break it to you but this isn’t the game where the “people prefer” fallacy means anything.
---
happy birth day and i hope to see 90% more boomkins on alliance side :)

I made a point but you're trying your hardest to ignore it. The guy is saying that streamers were invited for hype but he also says that the streamers are the ones doing most of the testing. This is where I disagreed with him as he has absolutely no basis for saying this.
---
This is what I was saying. You were ranting about something completely different for which I didn't even argue about. Quite honestly I don't even have the slightest clue WHY you replied to my comment in the first place as you're not making any sense in the context that's given.
---
If it's the same one I was watching, not only was it 8+ hours long, but the two big attack bosses were summoned at least twice (Ivus and the rock elemental).
---
sure hope they fix it. doesnt seem like much but its a deal breaker for me
---
*cries in spriest*
---
That was an amazing night.
---
Wangchief / TheJayde / OGreddituser summed it up pretty much perfectly I don't need to repeat it :)
---
Just remember you totems are your lifeblood in loads of scenarios, catch a pom pyro with a grounding totem, slow that rogue and burn it etc
---
Yeah it was one of the worst times of my life. But the game saved me.
---
I need to play this again in a happier state of mind.

The fan base knows so little! They think they do but they don't! I don't need to know what's going on at blizzard to tell you when the game is shit.
---
I really enjoyed the None album a lot. It meshes Djent and Trash nicely. But I also like their newer stuff but earlier stuff is easier for sure
---
For all the whining about it being a rush, all you need is 10-15 folk to defend and stop the rush. Turtling turns it into a fight and stops the Zerg rush!
---
I fkin loved AV weekends when you could get 10-15 defending! They were brilliant games! Great honor too, even if you lost! 
---
It’s up to players to change how they play AV!
---
Thanks dude! What about my other question how can i play classic right now?
---
Yeah Im' printing this.  beautiful
---
Robin is *gayer* then ever
---
Happy birthday as a fellow moonkin player have this award. 👍🏻
---
Have loved all of these concepts, although this is the only one I don't particularly dig. Notably because I was never a fan of the Cata interpretation of Uldum in the first place. I'd been facinated with Uldum ever since doing the Platinum Discs quests from Uldaman, but Cata Uldum justs didn't come close to delivering on the premise.
---
Personally I would have preffered that the exterior portion of Uldum had been the same size as the boundaries the area had during vanilla. However, there would then be an expansive underground portion making up the other half of the zone. Within the underground area could also be the entrances to the Titan-vault-city-themed Uldum Raid &amp; a Slithid-themed 5-man.
---
Buy subscription and hope for the best. It's random invites
---
You can easily have 3 expansions worth of content added for a potential Classic+. Blizzard knows that OSRS is where it is because new added content. OSRS huge spike at the beginning was paired with a huge drop right after. It would have failed, massively, without new content.
---
What I would like to see is Blizzard offering 3 server options, sometimes in 2021 : A TBC server option (with character copy from Classic), a Classic+ expansion server option (also with character copy from Classic) and what is left in Classic realms (95% will either play TBC , either Classic+) condensed in a handful of realms, and stay like that forever, a museum-like server option for Vanilla.
---
Blizzard will probably do it this way, because if they chose only TBC, or only Classic+, they will lose half the subs from Classic players.
---
Yes,level cap is 60!
---
You need to be invited to play beta, having an active subscription gives u a small chance, but nothing more! 
---
Mages are great DPSers, and well geared warriors are hard to kill in PvP.
---
EU Alliance, and I’m game!
---
naw, read a book, the flaw in the faux capitalism here is no free exchange of labor - all the labor is essentially forced when wages systematically reached a level of institutionalized dehumanism. the book is called Saving Capitalism. Voluntary labor is the pretense under which capitalism can work its actual benefit. its not voluntary when you get dehumanized by the work condition and worse dehumanized by attempting to opt out of the profit system subjecting you to the dehumanized condition.
---
The current devs are not gamers anymore. That's the problem.
---
Yep this sound a good solution ! But players with actual mentality probably won't do it, no ?
---
How many time i have read "No ! Don't def it's gonna be faster"
---
Capitalism incentivises corruption, its inherent to the mode of production.
---
I just assumed this was a bug that would be fixed.  
---
Were Shamans pink in Vanilla?
---
There were streamers in it, but it wasn't like Asmongold with his personal army. The streamers I was watching in there weren't directing anyone around. They had as much impact on the game as any regular player.
---
A couple of other streamers, Venruki and Ziqo, had a small bunch hanging with them just due to their popularity. But not a big army.
---
Obviously the famous line wasn't prepared before hand, it was something he said off the cuff, which makes it more egregious because its not something a PR team told him he should say, its just what he thought. 
---
Its just a condescending shitty thing to say. You're too dumb or naive know what you want, or you're to dumb to know whats actually good.  I'm sure if he had more time to prepare, he might have phrased it better.
---
I'm sure the "You all have phones don't you?" guy probably would've worded it differently too knowing the backlash.
---
I'm amazed at the amount of post about playing boomkin.  What a horrible idea.
---
Dude I’m not sure you grasp what classic is, I suggest watching some gameplay and learning about the game before making a post.
---
It's the devs job to provide solutions. Intact the fans shouldn't even be the ones pointing out the problems they should know when something is unacceptable. Quit making excuses for blizzard.
---
There is an exceptionally useful addon buried in here. Add a click on name to whisper interface and then you're cooking with gas!
---
Which one caused the turtle? Because the turtle game I was watching wasn't due to a streamers causing it.
---
To access beta you don't need an active sub. You have to flag your battlenet account as "I am interested in participating in beta tests of classic WoW' which you set up on blizzard page in your beta tester profile. Then... you have to wait. As of now... probably untill release since they are not willing to send more beta invites. It may change but it's more likely that you won't be invited, so don't get your hopes too high, you won't be disappointed then.
---
I'll just use the tier2,5 set
---
LPT that I did on my retail rogue and that I don’t know if it doable on Classic as I don’t have beta and wasn’t playing a rogue back then :
---
Macro all your stealth abilities with a /cast pick pocket and auto loot on in order to automatically do it when engaging a mob in the wild. Of course it won’t work if the mob isn’t eligible but when it is it works wonder.
---
I wouldn't recommend a Warrior to somebody who asks for the best DPS in Classic, takes a while to get the gear to be effective, compared other DPS classes.
---

---
Even though it is an alliance scum cake, it is too awesome not to be upvoted. Happy birthday!
---
I just wanted to err on the side of caution :)
---
Yes it is. Holy shit this community is so blinded by its own nostalgia they completely forget that the majority of players of classic will be either players new to Classic or Retail players returning to Classic for a breath of fresh air. Neither of those populations will desire a pointless hour long zergfest. People will stop queueing for AV and you few true nostalgia freaks will have no queues popping.
---
Yeah but once full epic (which takes half year and not one week as in retail) you are gonna be in top. I think op wants a class to be in top after raiding for a while.
---
Fess up; Who the fuck stole the middle bluff?
---
Never understood ppl who chose dead class flavouring for lovely cakes like that

Calling it for the night or not, depending if th we cables work

---
I remember when I was a kid my parents used to do something similar. For the summer holidays My mum and I went to stay with her mum for three weeks and my dad would join us for the fourth week then we would all go home together.  You have now made me realize if wow had been a thing back then he wouldn't have joined us at all! actually. If wow had been a thing back then my mum would have been visiting her mum on her own and me and dad would have been ganking alliance scum. For the horde! :D
---
as a caster, same!
---
:(
---
Wisp me for an invite, he said...
---
aka The Ninja Invite
---
Usually people just accept then ask "huh? what's going on" and you say "we needed a dps/healer/tank and I've heard you're really good"
---
Flattery will get you everywhere.
---
Was that about the Oogas? :O
---
WORLD PVP. Everyone keeps sleeping on this!! Will NEVER get stale. Never. The possibilities are infinite.
---
Some of by best Vanilla memories were in world PvP. Being caught off guard as Prot Spec going to a dungeon, catching people off guard, whipping out The Main/Guildies, getting revenge 10+ levels later, griefing quests/stealing nodes, 2v5s, making people die to mobs (more repair cost), instigating huge brawls by ganking someone in a known guild.... the list goes on.
---
So dynamic. So good.
---
Epic gamer moment😎
---
I'm confused, isn't Lor'danel already in Darkshore?
---
A priest of any spec is vailable for dungeons and MC as long as you are willing to heal. You don't even need to tell people you're shadow, just go heal.
---
It will be harder for you to get shadow dps gear but it will come in time, just don't party with any warlocks or mages.
---
No because I’m not an edgy teen anymore
---
Can someone ELI5 what has happened to make that priest immortal?
---
Low effort, 0/10
---
For all the complaining here that we'll get the 1.12 av instead of some cherry picked version - most players clearly dont want the longer games or they'll defend and make them long..
---
Understandable! I don't actually know the laws behind that. It's just...so pervasive at cons, every artists booth has dozens of characters you recognize and many have websites, so I always just assumed it was ok.
---
The developers intentionally made Naxx gear way more powerful than anything else in vanilla to throw raiders a bone. I'm not talking just itemlevels, they also optimized the itemization to cater to all the most played specs.
---
Interesting speculation.

in the Netherlands?
---
Nothing beats mage at farming. Especially once ZG gets released.
---
100% agree
---
I wonder if someone is actually going to do something like that
---
I almost forget about the Azshara Crater, was really pumped for this back in the days and really disappointing when they decided to not bring a new BG. In-depth ideas for great content, I like mate!
---
Nice blog post.
---
The story was so good and deep back then. Pleease, if Classic goes on after Naxx.. Please I want story deepness like this!
---
Gooble gobble
---
WTB: Animated ROFLMAO emoticon!
---
Why is it soo bright! Some kind of Instagram filter
---
You’re right. 
---
Since you have provided scientific evidence to back up your opinion let’s make a few other changes. 
---
Let’s give out MC epics for free to keep them happy. 
---
Let’s sell boosts to level 60. 
---
Let’s add sharding in completely. 
---
Let’s add LFR into the game. 
---
Let’s add the new welfare honor system into the game as well, you know, since we have to worry about making the game “accessible” instead of fun.
---
&gt; Intact the fans shouldn't even be the ones pointing out the problems they should know when something is unacceptable. Quit making excuses for blizzard.
---
What successful game have you designed? Like a great game designer once said:
---
I'll rather take his thoughts on this than your own typo-riddled babbling.
---
A company that has been bleeding employees for years and who's devs admitted they don't even play video games anymore "Many of us at Blizzard now spend many hours ourselves playing on mobile." It is no wonder retail is crammed full of micro transactions and pointless timesinks. You don't need to hear the board meetings to figure out there are morons in charge.
---
Better hope a horde player didn't bake that cake lol
---
Doesn’t matter, if it’s flat it’s flat
---
Blaaa blaaa blaaa
---
What about hyjal? That's pretty significant
---
Plus, weren't you gonna do quel'thalas?
---
Why do people think more npcs = longer AV? Several private servers have had AV with shredders, mines, guards, captains, etc. People still just ignore everything they can, kill whatever gives honor and then rush for the last boss. The BGs end in around 15-mins even with all the npcs.
---
5 subs 0 invites
---
Not only that but merging servers almost always goes terribly wrong. There are so many rows in these databases I dont even want to think about it
---
Life is GOOD
---
Jokes on you i dont have a house or wife and never left moms house
---
If incorrect echo chambers can happen on the outside they can happen on the inside too. This gives me a bad taste in my mouth.
---
Get me in this too
---
Thats alright, more cake for OP.
---
I read the class description, sounded cool.
---
wow cool:P
---
lol
---
That's why there are laws in Europe to prevent (some) of it and that's exactly what he said. And no, it is not inherent to capitalism, it is inherent to greedy people, who exploit the system.
---
But please go ahead and tell me what system was not used by the corrupt to enrich themselves.
---
Have you ever played a rogue at all?? Wtf 1 finisher per fight? 
---
You use a finisher within like 3 GCDs of coming out of stealth just to begin the fight.
---
Live in Colorado, fired twice for bringing up unethical company practices to my employer. (Am a LMT/LE)
---
It's funny how when they don't give you a reason, you can immediately know the exact reason
---
quel'thalas was pretty much made in the vanilla style though, the BC starting zones were already very vanilla-esque
---
Backpaddling also gets rid of the leeway range
---
Farming gold for pvp consumables is way more time consuming than raiding. You don’t necessarily need the consumables but you’ll definitely notice which players are using them.
---
?? what is the "you've unlearned the" thing?
---
in classic there's nothing there
---
Looks like Taurens moonkin skin
---
I'd say welcome to the US, where people bitch and moan about not wanting unions ... and then wonder why they repeatedly get fucked over by greed
---
😂😂😂😂
---
This is really helpful yes! Thank you for your feedback!
---
You're paying $50 a month for wow? Why are you using that many subscriptions?
---
Man, this is so sad to read ... and it is said/written everywhere. Why is everyone so miserable?
---
Best flag runners, best mobility, best k/d ratio in wPvP, best at doing a bit of everything

And ends with Mana issues.

Some people have got Eye of Divinity in Beta, which aside from the Battlegrounds they turn on to test, is in Phase 1. It could have been something they missed removing from the loot tables, or it could be that both the Hunter and Priest epic quest items are in Phase 1. We won't know until someone defeats Majordomo.
---
It's closed beta and, unless I am mistaken, they're not sending out invites any more since they have enough testers. Release Aug 27
---
I wonder how they justify changes that without testing quite obviously made shit OP (old days, but after vanilla, when the game was pretty well balanced in almost all aspects). You could tell from just playing the game and reading patch notes. It feels on hindsight 9 out of 10 times it was either hotfixed or tweaked in a later patch. The remark about the different variables is very interesting in that regard; although it is obviously true in general, somehow the experts who knew all the variables were unable to tell something was going to be OP. Whereas a random scrub who just played the game and read the notes could tell before they finished reading the change...
---
I think its RFD that is profitable, not rfk
---
Maybe while PvPing... kind of. Maybe?
---
encounters that only last 10 seconds so they can avoid the 5 second rule entirely?
---
I can only really speak about hunter and what I'd say is that R10 gear can be a way of breaking up devilsaur but ultimately is weaker than t1 gloves, so if you're going pvp/mc only then full t1 is the way to go. Pvp for them is good though, in the sense that you can often be useful even if undergeared thanks to viper sting. You'll need great ping and reflexes to do top-tier plays though.
---
The moonkin looks really good, props to the artist!
---
If by 3 active accounts you mean 3 active subscriptions, then yes you will have 3 accounts on same bnet that can play Classic at the same time (just like multiboxing, which I am planning on doing).
---
Can u fucking please understand whats the Meaning of the word: BETA?
---
It’s a testing area and Nothing is completly set as it is in the testing Beta area right now
---
God...
---
But marvel have a hulk.
---
Jeff Kaplan wasn't a game dev before he joined blizzard. He was just another elitist mmo junkie on the EQ forums yelling at the devs of that game. 
---
"Whoever came up with this sheer fisting of an encounter can go fuck themselves. Do me a favor so I don't waste my guild's time on this kind of jackass shit-fest again, send me an email at tigole@legacyofsteel.net when you decide to A) Implement an encounter that wasn't designed by a retarded chimp chained to a cubicle A.)Get a Quality Assuarance Department C) Actually beta test the fucking thing and D) Patch it live. And please for god's sake -- do it in the order I laid out for you. Don't worry, I won't charge you a consulting fee on that one. And for good luck you might as well E) Pull your heads out of your asses. While you're at it rename the game to BetaQuest since you've used up you're alotted false advertising karma on the Bazaar and user interface scam of '01.Fix the Emperor encounter. Fix Seru. Rethink your time-sink bullshit. Fix all the buggy motherfucking ring encounters (I suggest you let whoever made the Burrower one do this since that dude apparently laid off the crack the rest of you were smoking). Fix the VT key quest. Fix VT (just guessing it's fucked up considering your track record). Don't have the resources to fix this stuff? Move the ENTIRE Planes of Power team over to fixing Shadows of Luclin AND DO IT NOW. If you don't fix Luclin, you jackassess will be the only ones playing the Planes of Power."
---
When you respec, you unlearn all your talent-specific abilities/spells such as pyroblast and blastwave etc
---
I mean I know Ion from Blizzard said that but...  
---
Did you hear what /u/ganjjo from Reddit said? Obviously Ganjjo's guarantee is worth more.
---
What an inane way of shielding yourself from criticism and effectively shutting down constructive dialogue; "If we don't tell the fanbase anything, their opinions will be invalid because they don't know our reasoning.".
---
"You think you do but you don't" is such a strong meme because it really shows how long blizzard can stay in the "yOu doNt KnOw oUr ReAsOnINg"-chamber before coming out and admitting yhry were wrong.
---
Eu Horde and i am in.
---
well they could open the beta for av...

Thanks everyone for all the birthday wishes!  See you in August!

Why do we need a way out? Classic (no changes) can provide content enough for ~2 years. Extrapolate that through the xpacs... BC launch in 2.5 years, Wrath launch in 5 years, Cata in 7.5 years. Cata being the most common point for players complaints, leave it there (hypothetically) that's still another decade of WoW... more than enough.
---
Do you really think Classic+ would last a decade with the same level of interest? There's a large portion of WoW players who could give two shits about adding raids after Naxx, I'm not making it that far anyway. Whereas releasing a new leveling tier gives something to everyone, and adds a layer of freshness that would be missing in a 2.5 year old game.
---
Thank you!  It is red velvet btw!
---
Im not gonna argue with somebody who pulls out hyperbole in order to make a point.
---
My best guess is that the Spirit of Redemption (talent that transforms priest into at spirit healer when they die) is bugged.
---
aa yeas ofc:P
---
&gt; I read that a year ago and, while John is a great guy, I find this section of his book very distasteful. It's sort of an appeal to authority; "let us think for you, for you are unqualified."
---
Or more accurately, "based on years of real experience, you simply do not have nearly enough information to guess right about why we do things, so much so that in reality you are always wrong".
---
If that happens to be factually true, being salty and butthurt about it will not change it. You will not magically get the power to read the minds of developers from by getting upset over a truth you do not like.
---
As an Ontarian this is really surprising and cool! It fills me with a sense of pride that I’m not entitled to.
---
Thanks
---
Right. Because pulling out the “casuals will be playing this, better make changes” argument is not hyperbolic at all.

This happened to me yesterday,  I was playing my priest and someone whispered me to go heal in scarlet monestary libary, had a good time. This tactic definitely works
---
&gt;it is not inherent to capitalism, it is inherent to greedy people, who exploit the system.
---
Capitalism is a system made by and for greedy people.
---
It obviously never goes stale to the people who are really into, just look at the pserver scene. However the portion of the player base that are that into world pvp is extremely marginal. So no, no one's really sleeping on it, most people just don't care.
---
No changes.
---
Must be nice to at least have stress test
---
Since horde didn’t have paladin they shared the same color
---
More chances on invite i guess
---
Or "stop defending they've already won". Dis dat shit! I'm gonna make the fuqers bleed for every inch of ground they take.

You wrote something wrong on that cake...

Well if you have that much time then why don't you just go to the toilet ? Diapers seem a bit unnecessary in this case.
---
Mom's house: yep it's classic
---
Moved into wow time
---
Im not sure if this is a funny troll post or you serious :D
---
Yeah we can! You need to subscribe though
---
Awesome, I'll probably dualbox 2 of them because one isnt gonna play classic
---
Ummm. This passage basically confirms that the comment **wasn’t** a fuckup though.
---
Uh, you are the one that wants changes. I dont. I like the way they released it now.
---
I think you're overselling it a little, buddy. Watching aggro is something everyone have to do. Every role has their own concerns, so DPS aren't unique with their rotations (which typically boil down to like, keeping up Slice and Dice or something). Healers need to conserve mana, try and use the 5 second rule when possible, and not overheal.
---
I mean like if there is only 1 account for classic, I'd have to get another battlenet because I'd wanna play with my brother and he uses the main account
---
Yeah, this was maybe true until 2007-2008.
---
After that, Blizzard just went full suit-mode, and all decisions were based on market algorithms.
---
Huh, i never knew josh was so handsome. I always thought he sounded like a fat guy for some reason.

Add a rep grind mount for horde somewhere in there. Painted kodo i dont care.

That's why you hold their family members as hostages though.

Hmm, I've always wondered if they were related to Blasted Lands from Stephen King's Talisman: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Forum:The_Origin_of_the_Blasted_Lands
---
I have 5 weeks off paid leave from August 25. Who's laughing now? :P
---
Not really sure what it is exactly he is talking about here, but the *public* is an interesting way to phrase it. The voices he is undoubtedly referring to as "the public" are the voices who screamed the loudest and dug under Blizzard's skin. It's also a bit of a cliché reaction when people who were wrong (people who obviously  **were** wrong) get slammed by His Grace using the temporal flexibility of hindsight. 
---
In all reality there are a spectrum of people who are both wrong and right and exist in the gooey medium between. Speculation isn't an exact science. His writing is elegant enough, but it can't hide the contemptuous, bitchy 11th-grade schoolgirl tone.
---
The entire accumulated networth of these few paragraphs could have simply read: "Haters gunna hate, blizzard gunna blizz bitches!"
---
&gt; Jeff Kaplan wasn't a game dev before he joined blizzard. He was just another elitist mmo junkie on the EQ forums yelling at the devs of that game.
---
That's a pretty terrible example for various reasons.
---
First off, he was an amateur map-designer for various games (which, believe it or not, is how a lot of early devs got their start) so this idea that he “was not a game dev” is a bit naive.
---
Then, he was hired to do quest content (because of his creative writing degree) with Nagle under Metzen *because many of his friends worked at Blizzard.* Yeah, if I was a hobbyist designer and had friends at Blizzard who knew my work, I'd probably get hired too, LOL.
---
Furthermore, it took him almost **a decade** of on-the-job learning to finally move to a directorial role.
---
Finally, even if I were to concede that “just another elitist mmo junkie” yelling was enough to get him noticed and hired, he would still represent an outlier. One-in-a-million. 
---
So taking all these things into account, *this* is your retort for why players' solutions *aren't* 99.9% complete dogshit?
---
This guy knew before everyone else did !
---
Sort of. Heroic strike replaces your white weapon attack but adds some base damage, so really it's just a fixed amount of damage its adding (plus making your attack not glance). I wouldn't class it as a weapon damage attack like mortal strike though.
---
That would be easy for Asian players.
---
Came here to post this.
---
I'm sure they just hire out cleaning services rather than pay for staffed janitors
---
The race is real.
---
Wow really. Can't believe that people are willing to sub on multiple accounts. I'm personally too greedy to sub at all. I think it's lame that you have to pay to get beta access. :P
---
My friends haven't decided yet, they wanna wait and see which side gets the most RLs. I have already made up my mind, going Alliance even if I'm the only one.
---
Noggen when you need a smaller hitbox and you can have the best of both worlds.
---
God damnit
---
Wait, what. Viper stacks?  Unholy hell of the five-armed opposum that is terrifying if  true.
---
The race is Neal.
---
Hopefully more forget before the date. It's competition man.
---
Lol, no it's not. Capitalism, per definition is "an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state." It is in contrast to systems like socialism or communism, where everything is owned by "communities".
---
To make it very short: Both types of systems are (and have been proven to be) prone to corruption. There will always be people who will want to be better off, no matter the system. But a system with private ownership instead of a community one, has the very important advantage that any progress you make (e.g. a new invention, more efficient processes) are to your own advantage, thus people have an incentive to actually be productive.
---
To stop people from exploiting others (e.g. workers and consumers), there need to be laws. But not because capitalism is bad, but because (some) people are bad.
---
If by kid wakes up you mean your inner kid then i see no problem

great minds are miserable together.

Stop reminding people. Trying to make money off my name reservations

Your forgetting about imp sprint that i said that you get instead, vs mage, druid, hunter maybe warrior kite.
---
And 3gbcs after coming out of stealth gonna take a while when your backstabbing up to 5 cps
---
Can you imagine if Burning Crusade never happened and WoW Classic just spins off into alternate reality Azeroth (multiverse) after Naxx? 
---
New Lore, new characters, alternating paths.

Poor little retail baby, gonna go back to her binky.

---
Appeal to authority is a 100% legitimate debate fallacy.  It’s also one Blizzard apparently likes to employ. 
---
Fallacies only serve to limit debate. 
---
I would also caution you on calling people who rightly recognize fallacies as “stupid”.
---
Healing as a druid in Vanilla sucked, yeah. WotLK Resto Druid though, really fun.
---
Yeah man, a lot of people think that others will be annoyed with the random PM’s but honestly it’s not the case.  People are very polite as long as you are.
---
And that is simply false. You have never played vanilla and you clearly do not understand how the game was like back then.
---
Week 1 MC run will not happen, this is an objective fact and if you think it will, you are fucking DELUSIONAL.
---
Within week 1, no ones entire guild of 40+ members will be lvl 60. Even if they were (which is impossible) it would then take them 1-2 entire weeks to gear up for raiding.
---
First Rag kill will be on week 3 or so, or maybe a day or two before that. At the end of week 1, less than 40 people per server will be lvl 60.
---
AV is essentially a prisoner's dilemma. The 'optimal' thing for both sides is to defend all their points and NPCs while capturing the enemy points and NPCs, but trying to achieve that is way more difficult than letting the enemy team cap your shit while you cap their shit. The amount of honor and reputation you get if you're stuck in an hours long AV is god awful compared to what you get if you kill all enemy NPCs, cap all the things, and finish in like fifteen minutes.
---
If you're trying to farm rep or honor then the last thing you want is to get stuck in a stalemate.
---
You either severely underestimate how many people will try out Classic, or overestimate how many people will keep playing it after a few months. I'd be very surprised if 50% of players even make it over level 20, and at 60 after a few months the population is probably a tenth of the one at launch. You will have many very dead realms without layering.
---
What did he do
---
Are you saying people aren't stupid? You should do some reading and studying then. Maybe you can find a quote from Albert Einstein which says it pretty well.
---
I wonder how many people will actually do this
---
Spirit of Redemption bug. No one has yet figured how to trigger it.
---
I was in Not Enough Players in the early days. I only got rank 12 on my tauren shaman named Wee. So many good memories from that grind.
---
Wait, where is my beautiful princess?
---
Way to not address my point!
---
Jesus you're pathetic.
---
Silly argument, many classes bring a lot more that translates to party or raids damage than hunters. Windfury? Low hanging fruit, there are lots more..
---
Make streamer names on every server?
---
You are literally the one advocating trolling! Dont you dare try to pinn that on me mister!
---
I think you're giving too much benefit of the doubt. "We're concerned financially" doesn't appear in "you think you do, but you don't" to me.   
---
Sure, you can imply intent, but the phrase is strictly about what players want. I'd say you're accurate before the first comma, though. On a personal note, these moments show what's really on someone's mind. To me, that guy on stage was saying that he knew better than everyone who wanted to play Classic. 
---
I'm not going to get up in arms about it since we're getting Classic and all, but I'd say it was unveiled arrogance...and that's what bothered me the most.
---
Again, just my personal take.
---
If your argument is that “everyone is stupid” then that includes the people at Blizzard bro. 
---
Again, research the appeal to authority fallacy.
---
I can't tell you if it's blizzlike or not, but on beta instants definitely do.
---
It’s actually just a short trip away, go through the dark portal then get ported by a mage
---
No. Names like. Warrior. And priest.
---
I am not surprised you didn't understand the quote but that is okay. I don't think i need to research anything. As far as i know stupid people don't have multibillion companies. Thats enough to show whos opinions matter here.
---
We're in it to win it, boys.
---
Lol I wouldn’t have thought that
---
Not everyone is from the US
---
?
---
There is an error on this site ... when I open Hunter class there are some items but not all ... literally not ALL ... :P
---
Does this also mean that if you have 3 active subscriptions, on the day we get to reserve names each sub will get 3 names? I'm in a similar position to OP, I share my BNet account with two family members.
---
Basically on 1 BNet, we have 2 Legion Accs (no BfA) and 1 BfA account. Do my family need to upgrade to BfA? Or is it just the subscription on each of the accounts to allow name reservation?
---
Is the word "best" lost to time now? Why is every concept now a slot that something is best in? That's just gear, fellas..
---
 Thousand needles
---
you're doing good work son
---
DM is Deadmine, I think you meant DM:E/N/W, Dire Maul East...
---
Yeah, except we don't really.
---
Follow up:
---
Do you have to have a subscription to reserve names?
---
Not on that server anymore but it’s literally the only guild from horde I do remember.  They were a big deal.
---
You think twitch should be at blame for staysafe thinking no other race should be allowed to live besides white people?
---
He's a stormfront white supremicist
---
Yes
---
What the fuck does that mean
---
Probably warlock on retail, since the only reason mages were able to farm so good is because ALOT of mobs were missing spells to cast.

---
As far as I know most “multibillion companies” tend to produce products which are actually better or improved 15 years later.

That’s enough to show *whose* opinions matter here.
---
Thanks bud

This explains so much.  Thank you.  I’ve been curious for years.
---
\&gt;one step

Ahead of the bread-line.
---
Exactly, the companys opinions.
---
Dwarf nesingwary style with no hesitation
---
I was watching some streams right now and they were.. Playing AV all wrong? I mean I do remember the rush tactic where it's just a race to kill the boss first. People just ran past each other normally with a few stragglers coming back when I used to do it in Vanilla.
---
But as Swifty was fighting Drek'Thar a bunch of horde came back to stop them and I was like "Well, now there aren't enough horde on offense and it's going to be a turtle match on both bosses and this game isn't going to end." Which.. Is how it is right? I never PvP and I only did AV back in Vanilla for the rep rewards.
---
And they call it a mine.
---
few weeks is too late
---
Alterac Valley.
---
Keep pushing that fallacy. If you keep trying I’m sure eventually you’ll break the shackles of logic and reason!
---
And my axe!
---
I bet Blizzard has already made a deal with Streamers to give them access a few hours earlier than the general public so that they get their names. Of course it would all be on the hush hush, but something just tells me...
---
4hrs to 12 at launch would not be a bad time I don't think, esp if it's almost independent of kills and therefore competition.
---
Grinding out would be easily disrupted if even 1 person had the same idea I guess, and depends heavily on class.
---
Another benefit is that fetch/carry quests don't require visits to trainers to keep up effeciency.  When competition is so fierce it may well turn out to be one of the better ways to get ahead of the pack.
---
"Hey man you wanna come to my party after school? SIKE!!! See ya in August NEERD"
---
Personally not really but i can understand both sides. IF they were to do it they would really have to say ot before classic launch tho. It would piss so many people off who chose a class based on how they were in vanilla and then that getting changed. Imagine tolling a warrior to be a main tank and all of a sudden druids or paladins would be the better MT choice.
---
Huh? No it doesn't, that was clearly a stupid thing for him to say. The passage in the OP is not a defense of every dumb thing ever said by a Blizzard employee.
---
Horde velvet?
---
What do you mean sleeper op in wpvp? They are the best because you can escape anyone and sneak on anyone
---
At least oomkins taste good
---
That's awesome, I'm guessing you were with guys like HWL Lai.  R14 warriors were freaking super-hero-death-bringers
---
I remember the furnace room before that... that had me going open mouth
---
Well the Classic is build on modern client, modern APIs, modern server architecture etc etc. It using using moden, not 15 years old stuff. This means we get better product. Exactly what you said, products get better in 15 years. Now we get a game build on top of that better product? Notmy fault that you were too stupid to understand that and now i need to make this clear to you.
---
I've always played on PvP servers but been that guy who never attacks first, and usually helps the other guy kill a mob instead (mainly because I've been a tank and kill times have been awful the recent years so why even bother), BUT THIS TIME, oooh boy I'm rolling Mage and RED means DEAD baby! (No grays though, still got some bit of honor :))
---
The problem is, we are trying to solve a non-issue. Classic wow didn't become a hit in spite of non-layered servers. It became a hit because of non-layered servers.
---
The truth is, anyone who played ESO or SWOTR at launch knows that layering is a poor decision. There are many superior alternatives like clusters and future merging. Acting like layering is the only option to fox a non-issue just proves the decision makes are out of touch with the players.
---
have you ever seen mulgore?
---
Found the raid leader!
---
Raids are 40 man.
---
A lot of guilds will struggle finding 40 reliable people.
---
Also, once you have all the 'required' classes/specs/roles, there's like 20 spots left where you can bring whatever. Sometimes you'll have 2 mages, sometimes you'll have 8-10. Doesn't really matter.
---
My brother and I are subbed, and neither of us got in. It is a little bit surprising to me because we’ve gotten into Overwatch’s 2015 beta, the HoTS alpha, and almost every WoW expansion’s alpha/beta, but not Classic Beta. I think it just shows how limited the beta invites currently are. Nonetheless, I don’t expect to be given any special treatment.
---
It is, and that's fine imho. AV will have some drawn out matches when the teams aren't coordinated and that's when you'll see the bosses show up.
---
The problem isnt that people dont enjoy world pvp. Itd that its not worth doing as soon as BG's release. I love world pvp but i wont do it when i can do BG's for honor instead. I know i know what about the fun... well the most fun part of the game for me is improving my character and i rather do less fun things to achieve that goal than doing more fun things and at the end of the day thinking wtf am i doing with my life, i did nothing today. I would assume that many other feels the same. Everyone who wants to rank up, not even talking about rank 14 but lower ranks too will be much better off doing BGs
---
&gt; pay the HoA, 
---
Dude, where I live HOAs are not prevalent.  I'd never experienced one until last year.  I must say those organizations are about the least American thing out of principle.  I buy land.  It's my land.  And now some arbitrary assholes are telling me what I can and can't do with my land.  Like, if I don't want to mow my grass, Caren, I don't have to.  I have a deed to my property.  If I want to dig a 10' hole in the front yard and fill it with pop cans, I should be able to.  I can in places without HOAs.  
---
I know it's the hill-person coming out of me when I get all upset about those damn things, but seriously, screw that crap.
---
I'm /u/revkaboose, and this is my TED Talk.
---
Definitely not, you should report it.
---
Oh, this is great!
---
I think a reasonable number of people multibox, but no I'm not paying $50/month for wow.
---
ouch

I admit I did start raging ever so slightly before seeing the logo of the newspaper.

Them telling you right away the % of players in each faction will only nake it worse. Your secer might have a 30/70 split without you never even realizing, or at least not that the difference is that big. But if they tell you that right away no one is gonna create characters of the underrepresented faction anymore, it might encourage others to transfer and all of a sudden the split is 10/90
---
no, please dont.
---
That had me raging too when you'd pull 3 of them robot constructs the goblins make 😂😂

i can't be a wizard i lost my V-card years ago.  i'd recommend getting at least SOME action before becoming a wizard man come on!

I'm with you. People itt looking for incentives to PvP. The incentive is fun. WPvP is fun
---
or cheat on you after over a year together... then lie about having a major illness!
---
They both break up the community and both provide alternative instances of the same area within the same sever. 
---
Also they are both systems used by blizzard to address population issues.
---
Sorry, how is that not similar mate??
---
Is nelf  not the best you can do for an alliance hunter, though? I was thinking of going a hunter for vanilla (retail player), but this thread is making them sound trash. Is that true?
---
There is 3 hours av on private servers, I'm not sure why retail with perhaps less knowledgable people will do any better.  
---
I'm not sure why the assumption lies that everyone has the perfect strategy down, while I agree over time the meta will most likely be adopted and especially on certain servers and with large premades (especially if people are communicating before the gates open in AV) playing on private servers shows atleast for me a different situation where it was like the old classic, a zerg fest as no one coordinates or communicates. Possible the only kind of coordination I saw with the numerous AV's I ran this time around was people whining on the ones that did not know the strategy and that people where going to the wrong places, always AFTER it actually became a problem, never before. In vanilla while it was for sure more communication it was as far as i rememer it not enough (eu shattered hand). But perhaps this time around people will communicate better to randoms or perhaps I did not pvp enough in vanilla or on private servers.  
---
While it could have been solved many years ago I agree changing anything now will shoot themselves in the foot, so I agree they got a hard choice to make regarding AV balance. I think I am leaning against picking the best parts of each system and actually adding or removing what little they think needs like removing each backdoor into the main bases or whatnot. AV was never meant to be a quick rush I'd rather take the chances on getting what was originally thought out.

Inefficent. People with a high-intensity Life that enjoy WoW dont want to waste time in turtle-AVs

The first target dummy in wow. We sure have come a long way to our todays target dummies

You're a mage, so it's probably some kind of magic.

From another thread, Mulgore is inspired by the Rolling Plains in Wyoming.

Thousand Needles, the Monument Valley.

Many zones are just 3D versions of WC3 campaign maps though. Elwynn Forest and Silverpine Forest for instance. Pre- and post-plague human campaign respectively.

^(Please don't kill me. I'm just joking)
---
My experience as a hunter main in vanilla is the leveling process was a blast and raiding was kinda boring. 
---
The rotation I believe (if I remember correctly) is to get off an extra autoshot so you basically are an immobile turret a lot of the time with huge mana issues focusing on this very tight rotation.
---
Tranq and later the expose weakness debuff are interesting but not as much as other classes. 
---
Just my 2 cents from 2 years playing hunter in vanilla
---
Popular streamers are in many ways, actors. Their main goal (IMO) is to entertain the viewer. Nothing wrong with that, but it has been a relatively obvious "job responsibility" for years, ever since Twitch really pushed streaming into the arena of being a potentially full-time career.
---
You’re wrong
---
Cursed video.
---
yeah druids suck in classic. a lot of classes have broken specs but with druids its the whole class. if you wanna play druid just wait untill tbc classic is out and the game is fixed
---
I dont really see why he's clearly less geared? Fura rerolled from playing with Nightmares Asylum to playing with Curse mid Vanilla It's perfectly possible he dont have any of the good items like Neltharion's Tear, good rings, good amulet, etc.
---
Just not enough info.
---
Probably uni. Needs to haul the laptop daily.
---
Mages bouncing around spamming arcane explosion with everyone spamming ‘food pls’. Omggggg hyppeeeee
---
No, it used to be a feature.
---
Thats how the AV on my server went. But hours were days. You could log off on friday evening and log back on at sunday and still be in the same AV. It was great.
---
Sounds like too much work
---
If you don't find it fun, don't engage with it. There isn't much point trying to point out flaws in a system to those who are enjoying it.
---
imo, people are hype about PvP in Classic because Classic is the WPvP expansion. Every other version of the game had BGs, but Vanilla had the biggest WPvP and it's coming back.
---
&gt;The sad reality of Classic is that World PvP is sort of pointless
---
It's not pointless if it's fun. If you don't find it fun, well that sucks for you
---
We were broke, no money, parents bailing on us and we had tons of fun.
---
Now we have the money but cannot play the game. Sad.
---
I enjoyed this
---
Or do like me, marry a woman who loves WoW and play together.
---
Looks really cool, but it makes it seem like Mara is somewhat frost/ice themed while it really isnt.
---
What are you saying ? It is the state of 1.12 Alterac ! There is probably no bug here, nothing to do with BETA
---
&gt; Get ready to hop in a time machine to 2006
---
I hope it goes all the way back to launch - 2004:
---
- no Mauradon or Dire Maul
---
- auction House only in Ironforge
---
- world server down
---
- login queues
---
- and [Tier 2 looked nothing like it does today](https://m.imgur.com/r/gaming/oD8akY0)
---
AV that I remember was 4 plus hours of turtle.
---
there is a special button for account restoration - use it and tell them what you know about your old account ;)
---
i agree with you. having an addon that helps improve getting groups is not the same thing as cross realm teleporting. ive never heard anyone complain about someone using this type of addon in a private server. and im one whos hated looking for dungeon since it came out but its just a big deal
---
NOBODY GIVES A FUCK ABOUT AV ANYWAYS
---
One of my favorite quest chains, felt like a master of my class after that one! Good luck!
---
Do we officially know how many servers will be released?
---
Idd, fuck em.
---
This whole marketing campaign feels like a joke tbf
---
&gt; people universally assumed corporate decisions are thoughtless and callous
---
Yeah, well, there's a reason for that.
---
your best bet is to oom them while staying at max range. keep killing poison cleansing totems, and hit them with viper stings. It's worth to FD chain lightnings early, to midigate damage and create preassure.
---
If they decide to spam cleanse, hit them with downranked stings while you kite. you'll win if they want to trade globals
---
no he meant Dire Maul, pretty obvious idk how u didnt understand that lol deadmines is a terrible farm at 60 :P
---
Stormcloak\*
---
Brokentusk, dragonblight EU horde.
---
High warlord tauren warrior with a broken horn
---
This was a different time though. This was literally before Activision bought them.
---
Do we know how problems like this one will be handled in classic? Will they fix is in the phase the patch that fixed it got released or will they fix it from the beginning?  Same with the plague from Zul‘gurub. I’d love to see that but I guess they won’t make that happen again lol
---
Durrr nO cHaNgEs durrr
---
I believe power corrupts people. As long as the system allows small amounts of people to hold power over large amounts of people, people will be exploited.
---
Capitalism and representative democracy cannot truly fix those problems, even when they're heavily regulated.
---
i don't think you'll have any trouble reaching all your goals with your hunter. As far as PvE is concerned, i personally don't think people apart from hardcore progression guilds will care that much about min-maxing their raid compositions this time around. Besides, hunters do decent damage up until Naxx as long as you know your class and have a firm understanding and grasp of your class and rotation. 
---
Go with your hunter man. I'm doing the same
---
This has been discussed in depth: the concern that the initial few weeks will have lasting and permanent effects on the server. If it was just a few weeks harmlessly nobody would care.
---
Haha okay I will admit I was being petulant sorry
---
Proper preparation here
---
Preach said it best in his video, in the world you will lose. It is a dangerous world, and youre out there for hours at a time, you cant just take on 3 or 4 mobs like nothing. You will lose. You will die. So it makes every little upgrade, every potion, bag, green, rewarding.
---
I have no idea what you are insinuating! 
---
I was quite the master at keeping my imp under wraps! It must have been someone else!
---
I was playing around with a gnome Rogue until I saw her feet move in stealth. It was funny, but it really kind of took me out of the idea of gnome rogue. It was a bit ridiculous.
---
Its gonna sting when you have absolutely nothing to do after a month, besides farming honor 18 hours a day for R14.
---
He thinks there's going to be layering in bwl phase. He doesn't even know what he's talking about.
---
It's literally just pressing a button that's not even on gcd. How is it more effort than starting sprint or iceblock or berserking or whatever?
---
Guessing you are a pally player :p

So far everyone I've seen that has said "DM" meant Dire Maul with it.

Sodapoppin qq more

I gained like 20kg during Vanilla. Now have lost all of it, but since I am #nochanges crowd, guess I have to gain 20kg again...
---
I'm a battle between those 8 it depends on which iteration of supes, Ironman, hulk, and thor we get. There is an insane version of iron Man in the comicbooks
---
What happens when ZG gets released?
---
&gt; Classic wow didn't become a hit in spite of non-layered servers. It became a hit because of non-layered servers.
---
No it didn't.
---
It became a hit *in spite of* the legendarily horrible and humiliating launch issues, followed by the fact that it continued to be *2004,* a world with a completely different player culture, different competition, different technology and ecosystem.
---
Log-in queues were universally derided, realm mergers have always been a huge point of contention, and cross-realm BGs were praised at the time because of the terrible queue times thanks to the fact that by the end of Vanilla lots of people had stopped playing due to TBC on the horizon.
---
&gt; There are many superior alternatives like clusters and future merging.
---
Spoken like someone who has never seen the internet meltdowns caused by server mergers. The reason they don't merge servers anymore is because of how shitty the community reacted. It dwarfs any complaints on this sub regarding layering. *Dwarfs.*
---
You can start aoe grinding at level 21.
---
gaycake
---
If I had to guess, it has to do with the anti out-of-bounds tech they backported from retail. Maybe, maybe not.
---
It can go from boring to oh-shit very fast.
---
Deadmines is VC
---
interestingly enough on retail AV goes up to an hour almost in even matchup
---
lol just disable layering in 10+ zones. solved.
---
Since classic I've bought a house got married and had two kids.
---
Not sure i can bring myself to get rid of them all but maybe I can get my 4 year old playing too
---
You can get rank 10 as a casual fairly easy. It just takes a long time.
---
That is absolutely true. But so far there has never been a system where nobody had power. I don't even know what a system like this would look like, or if that is even possible. Hierarchies are a very integral part of humans (and many other animals).
---
Imo, the only way to fix the problem is through better education and more compassion by everyone. The education part is necessary to be able to stop exploitative people. But that's pretty unrealistic (if not utopian) and has nothing to do with the system behind it. Because (again) corruption has been a part of humanity in every system that existed so far.
---
Don't listen to these guys, your work is awesome and you can see in those maps that there is a lot of effort put Into them, an effort these guys didn't made, not even to criticise you. Great work!
---
Oh boy you're going to get brigaded by the no changes crowd. 
---
Seriously, the issue with doing this *now* is it skews the balance of a lot of things and would require rebalancing. It should happen, but realistically can't. 
---
If classic is a great success, they may add to it including balancing since they had plans to do that anyways before TBC if I recall correctly. It just can't be done to start.
---
That's a bad mentality to have, and layering will definitely be a negative force. I'm sure Blizzard isn't retarded they can rent the server space, and if the population goes down, just reduce/stop the amount of renting.
---
We have a village but that was a rewrite of the summoner araj questline if anything
---
It would be bringing back the good parts and not the poor design choices. Arguably better to anyone not blinded by nostalgia.
---
ah I see you're an LFR player
---
Did he offer any **specific** examples documented by widespread conjecture proven wrong, or is that just a blanket appeal to authority?  
---
Developers don't lack imagination, developers (and developer-centric game studios) some times get increasingly beholden to corporate overlords that are neither developers nor gamers and allow those "pertinent factors" supplied by the bean-counters to inform game design decisions which is what's brought us the "joy" of micro-transactions, value added services, early access, dlc galore and watered down shit designed to capture as many gaming demographics as possible while satisfying no particular one.
---
pvp sure, pve lolno
---
EU alliance ftw

Truth

Same man, blasted mulgore theme music in my fork lift last friday.
---
Amazing, my first char was a Tauren druid on boulderfistEU, didn’t even make it to 60, 50 even i think.
---
I was like twelve years old back then, but i remember the impression mulgore made, even got lost in spirit walks and stuff man, i love classic mulgore and thunderbluff.
---
Arthas was right
---
California has the redwood national park which is stuffed with giant trees
---
There was no dialogue to shut down. This book takes place in what 2001-2004? Blizzard didn't have an open dialogue with the players at the time, not like today at least.
---
Were you lagging a lot?
---
Can you easily recreate it?
---
Oof.
---
I don't understand the sarcasm or irony or whatever here.

This looks like a cool early design for an actual logo that they could use. Needs alot of work, but I like the colors and the theme.

&gt; But so far there has never been a system where nobody had power. I don't even know what a system like this would look like, or if that is even possible.
---
That's true, there has been no successful system like that, yet. And I think it's easy for people to conclude from that, that it's a Utopian pipe dream. Which, to be fair is possible, I used to think that as well.
---
However, I think our best chance of actually achieving this is a political ideology called Anarchism.

I can't fathom they won't have one of each timezone, PvE and PvP
---
Does anyone else find it surprising that the 14% parry at +3 levels appears to be tied to actual levels and not weapon skill differentials? Given how hit and dodge behave, I was beginning to think that the jump from ~6ish parry at +2 levels to 14% Parry at +3 levels was a function of weapon skill vs defense differences. The data linked seems to dispute that thought, though, as +3 levels with 5 weapon skill was tested and parry still seemed to be 14%.
---
This means that the parry jump is more like glancing blows chance, directly tied to level. That’s clearly how it’s working but it seems unintuitive, given weapon skills impact on hit and dodge. I wonder if that’s a potential bug/difference from classic. Should 5 weapon skill be mitigating that spike in parry at +3 levels?
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill
---
This article seems to support that it should be, or was at one time, tied to weapon skill. Just food for thought.
---
Heyy, thanks for the awesome writeup! Always love reading other people's experiences. Who knows, maybe, since I've never played shaman endgame, I will also get over Enhancement after some time and go Elemental.

This.

Been playing Pokemon since elementary school, from my blue a through every generation released.

Glory to the Alliance!
---
Sorry, the nochanges movement is already over, from here on out we have fast feet, cause of the 15 years of training.
---
You’ve never played a rogue. 
---
Good luck.
---
Can confirm people ave done this to me on Pservers. I often agree to tank things this way.
---
If you need more threat to down bosses faster then extra swings aren't that big of a deal. You get hit faster but you also get less hits overall if fight ends sooner and hps shouldn't be a problem.
---
See: C9 Meteos and C9 Sneaky’s mannerisms and speech patterns.

Who cares about some boring thot though?

Thanks. They are already on my reading. I still have quite a few books left before I finish wheel of time.
---
"Fuck you, I'm casting my dots"
---
Me and my SM-Ruin Lock. And I knew they weren't goint to kick me, who else would show up 90 minutes before a raid to farm shard to summon everyone... and then farm for health stones. And then lose the Azuresong Mageblade to the Team leads GF who played a Hunter, because of course she fucking did.
---
So you proceed to do despicable things. Intentionally cast fear to say she used Scare Beast, proceed to tank her DKP, spread rumors that the Team Lead is flirting with you because you play a female undead and no one has heard you on vent.
---
You ruin their enjoyment for the game because they dared crossed you and sometimes, in the pursuit for power, you must sacrifice others.
---
I mean... not like that's ever happened to me... heh...
---
&lt;.&lt;
---
Wrong game, nerd
---
Wow, that's an awesome cake.   
---
Also, boomkins are awesome.
---
Improved slow fall?
---
Exactly. Pretty sure Ironman could easily whip up some kind of kryptonite laser suit. Supes is toast.
---
Honestly it will be super interesting to see what they do either way because it's valuable information for them no matter which way they go.
---
If they stick with Classic + new content, it's them being more accepting of how the game used to play across the board. 
---
If they release TBC &amp; WOTLK then maybe they aren't as favorable to the old way like people would think, but at the same time gives them more data on the different types of gameplay era's and which is the most popular after going back through them. I think TBC/WOTLK are the least likely thing though, since the majority of content exists in current WoW unlike Vanilla. 
---
On the flip side, there's a lot less they would have to import/convert since they already have all that content on the live game, it would just be class related stuff they would need to adjust which should mean a lot faster release if they went this path. 
---
If the current/future expansions to WoW start going "backwards" in gameplay designs then I think that actually hurts the chances of both Classic+ content &amp; TBC/WOTLK re-releases because it says they agree some of the older ways was better and will try to push people into the newer game more heavily.
---
But then he plays alliance...
---
If they don't give us the vanilla rogue animation for stealth I'm gonna be legit pissed off :( this is minor to some but it's huge for others...
---
It was the most depressing time of my life, but wow helped me get through it.
---
It seems they have added that option for those who have the game installed, because people complained about how the beta cannot be uninstalled after is was removed from the launcher. I have uninstalled it and now it is gone completely from launcher.
---
He did tho.
---
I want short AV too... you think you lot speak for all of us vanilla players but it's not true.
---
Multi day AV was absolutely pointless.
---
In all seriousness, getting back into WoW, trying out classes has been great for me. I love logging in, doing quests, then partying with some people ending up talking randomly about stuff.
---
Depends on how many swipes you get in. If you spam swipe and have the pummeler buff then you're attacking \~3 times every 2.5 seconds, comparable to the SnB warrior in my example, and if you don't use swipe at all it's down to \~1.5, roughly halving the effect.
---
Why is there always like 10 people in these threads telling people to 'play what they want' and 'dont pick somthing based off of X reason, only play Y because you find it fun'
---
The guy didn't say he couldn't have fun on other classes, he just said he was considering mage at first.
---
Just let the guy pick his own class and answer his question. If you don't have an answer, move the heck on. 
---
OP: Probably fury warrior or warlock, but if gear is your concern then I wouldn't bother with warrior. There's going to be a ton of warriors and a ton of competition for all their gear.
---
The sad thing is, this summarizes WoW lore up to BfA pretty well.
---
Nice, what are the reasons for not grinding on the way to brill? Afaik suiciding on the pumpkin field moves you to deathknell gy
---
Thank you kind stranger!
---
And then get shanked in the back by a rogue while drinking to recover from that 10 second fight?
---
LOL this is so great. Best one on here in a long time
---
Where did you get that book?
---
i think it is intresting to consider this if you put it into the context of say TBC or WotLK. where you can fly in outland but then blizzard adds a reason to go to azeroth where you can't fly so you have this sort of situation where part of content you fly while others you don't.
---
i think the pathfinder system they currently have is too on off like it makes sense that once the exp pack is done you can fly over it all but during current content having it be ALL of the flying or non of the flying isn't really a good system. having it where you can fly in parts and other you can't is much better.
---
an intresting idea to add is that when you add a new zone like this the adjcent zones are no longer flyable for the patch changing part of the world for a bit. and honestly adding land masses to azeroth in BfA would have been a good exuse of war meaning we need to use previously unimportant landmasses.
---
It's because you didn't played an MMO.
---
That one is fairly easy to solve, since you can run to brill and take a zeppelin to org then run down to meet her if it is :) or vice versa.
---
No, fuck that, I'm not tanking for your scuffed group to SM. It's a long fucking walk. I saw you advertise in /world and /trade... "good group g2g" my ass, I've heard that before. 
---
Don't solicit me for tanking service, I *will* charge you.
---
I created a tauren during stress test and for a while was wondering what are all those tauren paladins doing here..
---
Not going to roast you.
---
The game will.
---
Some kind of god of war
---
Warrior, Mage, Rogue.
---
The holy triad of Vanilla DPS.
---
Actually it's the BALANCE of 1.12.1 but with phased content. AV was considered more balanced post-patch and made it have a purpose.
---
Not all of us vanilla people like multi day AV ... it was still separate from the game world and served little purpose.
---
Me and the boys, of course ;)
---
Name checks out
---
Noone in beta is using max level stealth. Lower rank stealth has a shitty animation.  LVL60 you get the smoother stealth rank iirc?
---
I'd bang his ex wife while we level together so we can gank him together.
---
You think that's much? People are paying up to 1400 dollars for a beta account.
---
You can run in and solo the crocs. They drop bijous and other juice.
---
Phase 2. Eye of Divinity requires you to kill Kazzak and he isn't even active on the world until P2 so there is not way either would drop before them.
---
I'm quite sure MD wont even drop any loot until P2.
---
Which encouraged bots and afkers...
---
Time will heal those wounds.
---
More specifically 27th of August. 🦆
---
I don’t want to burst your bubble but 2 weeks of playing  a few hours after work is not going to be enough to hit 60, let alone get gear at 60. So you’ll have to do more than raidlogging when your family is back 😉
---
So they are going to allow Eye of Divinity to drop, but nobody will be able to get it because Kazzak isn't active? 
---
They are going to allow hunters to start getting their bows before the priest staff is even able to be completed? Doesn't make much sense to me.
---
Believe it or not, Prot Warriors are faster.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
We all get shanked eventually.
---
&gt; But the rose tinted shades are already fading.
---
Too bad people aren't playing Vanilla for the combat mechanics then, but for the satisfaction from actually earning your shit and forcing you to friend people in the process.
---
As many other stated, sounds like classic isn't for you. That doesn't make the game wrong. It makes you incompatible with the game.
---
I never played the original AV. How are rewards calculated?     
---
Do you get the deserter buff if you quit early?
---
KEEP EM COMING MY GUY
---
Warlock.
---
But not for their DPS!
---
[this tweet sums things up pretty nicely](https://i.redd.it/edxzdlyrdb431.jpg)
---
where?
---
&gt; Casual players, who have always been the majority in WoW, expect to be able to log on and play the game whenever they like, which is honestly a completely reasonable viewpoint. They are paying for the product after all. 
---
Casual players also don't want to have to spend a month getting to 60, they want to be able to transmog their clown suit, and they want flying mounts because running around Azeroth is too tedious. Why break away from the principles of vanilla WoW to cater to casual players in some ways but not others?
---
&gt;And we need those players. Because if only the diehard fans are left, we'll have trouble filling a single server.
---
More doomsday bullshit. Current private server players could fill multiple Classic servers. Why would Classic be less successful than private servers?
---
&gt;there are going to be a heap of retail players checking out Classic who probably won't stick with it.
---
And those retail players will be randomly scattered across all servers. I never said that every server will maintain 10k population, but you can't honestly believe that only a few servers will somehow lose 90%+ of their population within Phase 1. Because that makes no logical sense.
---
And like I mentioned before, even if this did somehow happen, server merges are *still* preferable to layering.
---
better than the constant layering/sharding shitposting
---
100%. I loved healing in Ulduar so much. I like how Druid’s really found their identity with hots after vanilla. Wild growth is a great spell
---
Alright, I've watched the video, at least until he went into the specific subgroups ... Anarchy is not the solution (yet?), imo. There are a few reasons ...
---
* Direct democracy: to put it mildly, the majority of people are not nearly educated enough to make good decisions. Just look at the mess that is the Brexit. That is a result of direct democracy. Often, people think they want something, but never think of the actual consequences. That's because knowing all the relevant information about all the important topics is work, people (on average) neither have the time nor the motivation to do it.
---
* How will you enable cooperation without a certain set of rules? Right now we have laws and contracts, and a judicial system to enforce them. Without authority and without defined rules, how does that work? Cooperation, especially among a large group of people, also needs to be coordinated. So you'll naturally need some form of governing body that handles this coordination from a somewhat higher level.
---
* This naturally leads to hierarchies. They are really useful to coordinate groups. Like in any big project (or company). There is some overarching goal and multiple groups work on smaller things that all contribute to the big project. So there is a hierarchy in the design itself: Someone overseeing the whole project, then people overseeing the groups and then obviously the "regular" workers in the groups.
---
* And how do you motivate people without any incentives? Have you ever heard of the free rider problem? Whenever a system allows to get something for free, there will be a significant amount of people who will not contribute.
---
I've been prepping for years and didn't even know it.
---
Nice post. One innovation that will make ranking slightly faster in classic is bracket stacking. If you force every ranker in the cartel to get exactly the same amount of honor, they will all recieve the same (the maximum) amount of progress towards the next rank. Of course if you're doing this for the top bracket you must ensure that nobody on the server gets even slightly more honor than the designated cap.
---
This method can speed up ranking by quite a bit if you manage to do it every week. This video explains the honor system in full detail along with how to organise an honor cartel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I_5Gwx2NjM
---
Woah you sure are going to show them!
---
*Burn*
---
What i remember of it you got honor and rep from doing the hand in quest. Honor from kills. It was mostly big fights in the middle. Near the bridge. And the graveyard in front of horde base. Deserter debuff wasn't there from the start. I think it was late vanilla or somewhere in tbc. Not sure though. Lower levels were often farming the mobs to complete those quests.
---
I don't even know what to say to this. You can't honestly believe that 90% of players will abandon Classic within the first few months.
---
Only 2 shamans? That’s going to leave one of your melee groups without WF.. those poor bastards
---
[deleted]
---
Ofcourse we can, not playing undead is like playing as a gnome
---
Because their job is to make a playable game on release day.    
---
Not make it so everyone is able to play the beta or fix a minor launcher issue.
---

Downvoted for logic, wasnt even dismissing the idea its just to early
---
He's level 60, so yes
---
 What a load of crap.
---
Soda hasn't complained about these guys because he plays on the same faction as them you pleb
---
Leveled 3 60s in retail vanilla and 2 lvl 60s on private servers.  There are some hardcore groups of people that will only sleep a few week one in order to get MC done on the first reset.  We’ll have to see come September.
---
They said classic will be left alone. They dont want people to play classic to get stuff for bfa.
---
Bad carbs though. They won't sustain you.
---
What? No, I'm pretty sure Mulgore is based on [Monument Valley.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley?wprov=sfla1)
---
Yeah, I've got to make sure nobody else's going to be Ipeegreentea besides me
---
Martin Luther King did not die for this.
---
I had an absolute blast in PvP in vanilla as a Druid. They're kind of shitty 5 man healers, but they're useful for raid healing the DPS by throwing HOTs on anyone and everyone.
---
They have mana issues though, so you're basically there for innervate and MoTW.
---
Enough with this nonsense. This sub is not in favour of sharding at all.
---
Old AV was rubbish, it encouraged heavy botting and AFK... it was a concept that just didn't work very well. AV had no affect on the world, it had no reason to be a multi day clash.
---
Maybe we were impressed at 15 years old, but f\*co that now.
---
&gt; merged server will have no meaningful history up to that point.
---
Well that's no different from layering, which will have each layer's "history" merged in the same way that servers would. So you would prefer a small % of players having to change names over the negative impacts to community, gameplay, and economy that layering introduces. That doesn't seem like a logical tradeoff to me.
---
Just order a second pizza
---
Not at all. Go watch some streams of actual hardcore vanilla raiding. Like some of Vanguard's speed runs that have DPS perspective.
---
The era of our lives that we had the most friends \*Happy Cry\*
---
Yep. Because I'm unoriginal and lazy.
---
Heck, people can say what they want, gaming was significantly better than hanging out with the fake ass people I didn't choose to be in my class at the time. School was boring as hell, adventuring in Azeroth was dope, and will be again! But hey, mo-de-ra-tion tho!
---
Why do hit boxes matter in WoW? All hits are counted by the RNG sent they?
---
Corporatism != Capitalism
---
Isnt your hitbox fixed and doesnt change if you use items?
---
To lose 5kg a week you need to burn about 5000 kcal a day you ain’t doing that on a water fast some unless you weigh 350 lbs to begin with.
---
Nope
---
Since classic I'm still playing in the same bed room.  Technically not moms house cause sadly only pop and I these days
---
For world pvp and single player action absolutely daggers.
---
For group PVP and BGs, swords can be good because of their insane sustained DPS. Swords are good at 1v1 or 1v2 if you have insane gear.

Noggenfogger is random though. What do you do if you receive slowfall?
---
that's a shit ton of content, I hope they do take a look at this and at least think about it
---
If you want to survive longer with less or no food you need to be fit not fat.
---
nice link
---
They're great tanks.
---
Firstly because they get 1% extra dodge and secondly because their wisp has increased movment speed, which is fantastic for all the dying you'll be doing.
---
Humans are better Warriors though.
---
If you like Night Elves, play a Night Elf. It's not worth levelling a race you don't like, and then being unhappy with it at 60. There's far too much time invested to play something you're not happy with.
---
In vanilla you used Mind vision, jumping from mob to mob until you were close enough to target the named one you were looking for. (Mind vision is broken on private servers)
---
It's an optional addon you halfwit.
---
EU Alliance? Then I'm down
---
Been enjoying staysafe more these days. Asmond is a joke but entertaining to watch rage: Its just funny how bad he actually is.
---
We birthed Intellect? Can I birth some Strength and Stamina instead? Because I am rolling a Warrior.
---
Too many raids. What makes classic so great is the focus on the entire game not just endless gear treadmills in the form of raids.
---
I don't think it's a bug.  I could definitely see him.
---
Dual Wield arms is objectively the best soec 20-40 because of improved overpower, but the spec is mostly unknown.
---
i use slice and dice as my finisher. The damage it does vastly outweighs one eviscerate.
---
Totally disagree. I love turtle AV’s, great fun defending a Zerg!
---
Yeah I know I was being sarcastic to make fun of the sort of people who jump on this crap by screaming no changes
---
New = better. Wow, that's your argument on the Classic WoW sub. It's fitting you think all people are dumb, how else would it explain you?
---
See my main warrior on the normal beta I have attachment to. I hit 40 almost have my mount. My priest on the beta is 17 and I’ve cleared VC. These pregenned characters don’t give me the same juice
---
Where can you reserv the name? On your account website?

Thank you!  See you in August!  Druid code
---
Not vanilla?!
---
If you’re the Ranjii who sits in Stonetalon for days on end, ganking lowbies.. you do deserve a swift knock upside the head for sure. Lolol
---
Skulls for the skull throne!
---
So mean :(

Haha, the frosting was at least!
---
One for the Coast Guard
---
I was pretty sure they took inspiration from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World.
---
So damned good.
---
Hi sorry to reply so late but can you tell me why your alts will be level 35 please?
---
This hit home my dude
---
I am sorry but that if you don't understand why sometimes new actually is better and why we will be having those newer and better things in Classic you are total retard. Or are you going to play the Classic with 15 year old "better" computer? Holy shit you made fool out of yourself. Ahh thanks for a good laugh.
---
Ah, cool!
---
I’ve seen someone say this once before, but if it’s fake I don’t think I’ve EVER heard him break the act. Don’t see how or why someone would keep that up for many hundreds of hours.
---
Don't go there, you will get ganked by the Ngorongoro mafia !
---
just roll on their weapons to show dominance
---
Can confirm.
---
I had to comment b'cos i also played Vanilla up to and including Cata, i am also rolling a Tauren Shaman crazy just can not wait to have those feels at seeing Thunder Bluff (Best city in WoW easily)
---
Troll sweat*
---
Yessir, Big white and outta sight.
---
This would encourage retail players to ninja gear for transmog purposes so yeah that's a no from me dog.
---
Mages are not gear dependant for PvP. They can basically PvP naked and are still good because they are all about CC in BGs.
---
Hunters are good with shit gear as BM early on, but they get really strong with good gear later.
---
Warlocks need gear, if you cant raid atleast BWL or better AQ, I wouldnt recommend WL.
---
I think all MMOs that go the vertical progression path do purposefully obsolete old content one way or another to keep things fresh.
---
There is ESO which is horizontal progression and does have raiding content, but it is very messy in a lot of ways and raiding is no where near as rewarding of an experience as it is in WoW.
---
Anyone know if the exploration EXP is the same?
---
But WoW should come out NOW! We don't need the beta.
---
Now hear me out
---
I might not be an expert in ships designed for warfare, but that ship does not look all too functional.
---
100% a projection.
---
Happy cake day!!!!!
---
I got over it too. Basically relearning how to play vanilla rogue though.
---
There's is always that ONE friend, lol
---
Savory Deviate Delight would be better, yes.
---
Why is your cake just white with For the Alliance on top i could have sworn there would be some sort of cool design in the center like maybe the alliance crest?
---
I guess you didn’t see one of them get real real mad about layering and stop the role play.  Guy turned into a Trump apologist and raged at a female for saying the word hubby in world chat.  
---
They are actually mad.
---
Can I ask if this is the type of guild that claims elitism for expecting a decent level of play because "they have a life", or  are you actually not daft like that, because that'd be great.
---
No. It has been tested multiple times on Beta.
---
shhhh
---
Taurens have a larger hitbox and can hit from 2yds further and be hit from 2yds further. You can change it to a smaller hitbox with noggenfogger/savory deviate delight (as you shapeshift when you use them).
---
My friend had a macro or something that whispered everyone of a specific criteria he wrote in like: "priests level 43-49". Thats like 50 whispers all at once and we got groups very fast like that. It also was pretty detrimental to his reputation because of obvious reasons.
---
You’re wrong. The world you entered is superficial and inaccurate. It’s a shadow of what the world really is. You need shrooms my friend, that’ll take you to the true world.
---
I do understand that. Yet, your arguments ranging from wordshipping money, thinking most people are dumb and new servers = better are a hilarious train of thought. It's like you think all your thoughts are insightful. Arrogant as hell.
---
Marvels got a blood elf too.
---
It may as well have been asmon, it was someone big.  They were try-harding because some streamer named Vigor was on the horde team.  Apparently is hated.
---
you do realize a tank warrior gains 15% more threat, furthermore the good threat talents as dps are first  much deeper into fury
---
Pepepains
---
I dont think it is worth it anyway. Just go Orc.
---
ha! 15 year ago me never had it better... Sorry lil fuck
---
&gt;*\[...\] I'm not even referring to the trolls dredging the forums for flame wars; I'm talking about the intelligent,  well-substantiated, and reasonable arguments about why Blizzard did this or why Blizzard did that. \[...\]*

Yes, any DOTs stack when different players cast them
---
For priests the tier sets ( 1, 2 and 3) are really good and could be concidered bis if you take into account everything a priest does. 
---
Most experienced priests does however run with multiple items in their bags and change to what is best for the actual boss you are fighting.
---
Even now I always say that to everyone and people call me crazy.
---
All I need to be happy:
---
- a house with good wifi
---
- a computer with classic and non ending content being released, no expansions (maybe just BC?)....
---
Aahhh.... Bliss....
---
OMFG!! I forgot about that gem!
---
Stranglethorn vale is inspired by the Amazon
---
welcome to your first multiplayer game
---
Ngl.  You get on the server and chat is just people saying they're sick of AV already.   Server has been low pop the whole time.  They should have opened it for all and ledt regular servers up.
---
Report to GM and move on.
---
Ignore, report and move on.
---
Seems trivial but cool, have fun.
---
Test Guild Please Ignore
---
Sounds awesome!
---
I am sorry but i can't take anything you say seriously after your train of thought.
---
With orc you always have the same hitbox and Im sorry but some people play different races.
---
Im listing ways where you can have an advatage using it.
---
Also orcs are even uglier but that's irrelevant.
---
Dedication.  I will follow such a man into the depths of hell.
---
Hopefully there are no honor cartels.  Illidan horde didn’t have them and it was great.  Illidan alliance had them and they afk’ed out or queue dodged any organized horde group.
---
You're going to get far

You must like this comment to post it on two threads.
---
Haha yes!
---
Keep ganking him.
---
I think early on someone asked this exact question, and it was no.
---
Being able to escape the deadzone as a hunter without even using gcd is actually a fairly big advantage.
---
 Also +2yd reach as warrior is pretty big if you can turn it off when it will be used against you.
---
Obviously it's not OP but there are a lot of mechanics that give you just a small edge if used properly and for some of us it's fun to try to play as best as possible (esp in duels)
---
Only in classic, not in vanilla
---
Slow games will be bad honor, so defending at all as horde means you’re turtling and ruining honor gains for people that want to farm it.
---
Have you learned nothing? The first 5 days of any Warcraft release are completely unplayable.
---
Imagine if your dad died, and Elon musk hired a top notch team of scientists not bound by ethics or laws. They bring your dad back to life... but you can’t see him. He’s being “beta tested” in a secure location, and for some reason it’s televised. You can see your dad again on August 27th with everyone else.
---
That would suck lol.
---
….
---
Yeah. For hours and days. Like nonstop. I dont like this chick much. But none of the other streamers would be ok with that kind of ganking either.
---
only experts in ship design can see its potential
---
Are you going Alliance or Horde? This matters because if you are going Alliance Warlocks are more needed than mages. For some reason people are terrified of WOTF on undead so they don't tend to role Warlocks on the Alliance faction. If Horde i would say go mage. More people role warlocks on the Horde side so rock a mage and you will be good to go.
---
It's always a stealth archer in the end
---
I was thinking about doing the same ! Can only compare it to Classic since you have to explore the world :)
---
Fuckin Robin's outfit has me dying
---
There is nothing exciting about 1.12 AV anyways. You can just play AV on retail and get the same boring experience.
---
I feel like they’d have too many different servers to justify tbh. It costs money to even have them up.
---
Why is Hulk wearing a shirt, tho?
---
I know I used to be able to land on top of that tree, but I couldn't keep walking.
---
&gt;Direct democracy
---
You say people don't know enough to govern in their or their communities own best interest, but I don't believe this is true. Furthermore, elected officials already don't govern in the best interest of the people, they govern in order to keep and accumulate as much power as possible.
---
&gt;How will you enable cooperation without a certain set of rules?
---
One of the tenets of Anarchism is called mutual aid. A common Anarchist slogan is "From each according to their ability, to each according to their need". This essentially means you're not entitled to things produced by the community if you don't partake in the community. Anarchism is not a system in which anyone is just allowed to do nothing and consume endlessly, unless you are unable, you're incentivized to contribute.
---
Anarchism is not against organization, it's only against vertical organization where power is from the top down. Anarchists want vertical organization where power is spread equally.
---
Anarchists generally believe that humans are able to self organize meaningfully without one person at the top with all the power, even in large groups.
---
&gt;They are really useful to coordinate groups. Like in any big project (or company). There is some overarching goal and multiple groups work on smaller things that all contribute to the big project. So there is a hierarchy in the design itself: Someone overseeing the whole project, then people overseeing the groups and then obviously the "regular" workers in the groups.
---
Anarchists deny the right of someone to own a company, but it's important to note that some amount of hierarchy is permissible in Anarchism provided it's proves necessary.
---
Hypothetically in a Anarchist company, you could have a directer of fiances, or a team leader, the key distinction is that those people would hold that position with the mutual consent of everyone involved, and when it's necessary to do so.
---
This is another video that I feel like touches upon some of the things you're talking about here from the same creator: https://youtu.be/P-MhzLMY93I
---
can get behind of almost everything, nice work!
---
Warrior , Rogue, Mage. However many people will be rolling these classes already. Warlocks are really good once they get good gear, and Hunters are amazing in the first two tiers.

Yep. You might end up finding a gnome warlock in Azshara in the guild Warriors of Ironforge. Not quite what you were looking for.

No, it's the children who are wrong.

One time during a guild 20 man split ony run, phase 3, its going bad. Healers are dropping. We gonna wipe for sure.

Wait? What's this? A hunter pulls a MID FIGHT cable brez on the best priest healer and we just manage to get it done.
---
Yep. Hunter power.
---
(This was also useful on some long fights like nef where at least one guy forgets his cloak)
---
Classic? There is no such woman buddy, you better start asking questions
---
I would be willing to bet that this would be the most toxic guild ever.
---
Arent you the guy that camps lowbies ?

Did you expect flowers and wine ?
---
TIL ! Thank you very much kind sir
---
tl;dr "don't criticize me bro"
---
Blizzard has made a ton of REALLY BAD changes and no amount of "but we thought really hard about it, man" can change that. He also tries to make it sound like they understand ALL of the problems that are created by some of their changes, but they do them because the benefits outweigh the problems. I genuinely don't believe this to be the case because of how many times Blizzard has just let game-changing issues go unfixed because there wasn't enough outcry from the players, most of which didn't know the game well enough to even notice.
---
Southern Mulgore is literally named the Rolling Planes.

---
If it wasn’t in 1.12 you should expect not to see it. I would think simple QoL things like this will be in addons people make, but that’s also not a certainly
---
Every triggered fuck in this thread is missing the point. This passage does not say that Blizzard's reasons for doing what they do are good, just that you're wrong about what they are in specific cases, regardless of if they're good or not.
---
Wow thanks for wasting 10 seconds of my time. Welcome to world of Warcraft, and the fucking internet.

I played there too o/

That link tho

Really?  More than [insert ANY streamer name]'s guild?

The blood of the alliance!

^^ This is what I was waiting for.

Would just be a guild where people bitch 24/7

The spectators aren’t like that in true classic in BRD. They have range casting and healing mobs.
---
Wait I'm confused, you said the best part is keeping your wife and house?
---
&gt;Now i'm not talking about the trolls and gnolls being missing because that's not too relevant but I think perhaps if they are just guessing about what to add back in they might have just added the captains and lieutenants back in and missed all sorts of the generic guards that were also removed in two patch stages.
---
I have played on private servers that emulate 1.12 AV and also ones that emulate earlier AV. The reason the map isnt exactly as it was is simply because the old AV map dont exist in the 1.12 client files. Cant do anything about it.
---
But that being said, the old AV with mines, elite mobs everywhere and the games lasting considerably longer is just a lot more fun to a lot of players.
---
If you want quick BG's where you zerg an objective there's WSG and AB for that. Imo they should have done like private servers did and tried to closely emulate the old AV to the best of their abilities.
---
Zug zug
---
Nah nothing to do with that.  I’m fairly successful, just lots going on in my personal life that isn’t joyous
---
Batman's mark, what is it? Something from Naxx? I dont recognize the skin
---
That's mean, you almost made me feel like playing a human, Batman is really my favorite hero!
---
But no, I'll stick to Horde!
---
The lace is teal
---
Dalaran Crater was my favourite.
---
It doesn't have to be for everyone. Don't like, don't play. ezlife
---
Fair enough, looks like the comment hit a nerve with a lot of people though
---
I legitimately don't enjoy getting ganked, so I'm glad there's gonna be non-PVP servers.
---
There is going to be very little loot for you as a fury warrior in the first phase of MC. Weapons and a couple of other random items but other than that there isn't much. But good luck at least you can get he Savage Gladiator Chain from BRD arena runs and that chest will last you until AQ40.
---
Man it's post like these that make you realize how many special snowflakes there will be "inventing" low grade garbage. The game is FIFTEEN years old with private servers all along the way.
---
I don’t The the statement “retail is bad” can be backed up by objective analysis when plenty of people still enjoy the game and don’t consider it bad
---
This guys is funny, Few decurses. You mean Tons of decurses!
---
I spent months trying to grind out rank 14 on my rogue in vanilla.  I played on a server with high pop horde and low pop alliance.  Even though we won every BG we queued I still had to wait 30+ minutes to get into a game and most of the time the enemy team would just afk out against us so we would win in 2 minutes or less and basically get no kills for extra honor.  Because of this I spent most of my time camping instances and flight paths to gank and kill as many people as possible to maximize my honor per hour.  It was a tedious job and took way more work than just stomping bgs in short queues all day.
---
I know a few people on Alliance who had 2 GMs while Horde were still grinding out High Warlords.
---
Probably the most upsetting thing for me about my grind was giving up after receiving a 3 day ban on my last week of grinding.  I had hit rank 13 (doing all that work as described above) and was burnt out but determined to finish the grind.  At this point I had slowed down my cp farm to let others get the rank before me out of sheer generosity and kindness (because I was at rank 11/12 and getting way more honor than those are rank 13).  After they hit rank 14 most of then quit grinding, understandably so, however this further hurt me because I had less people to queue with.  In the last 2-3 weeks I was competing mostly with a guy and his brother who were account sharing and I really really REALLY wanted to be done with this grind myself.  The stress of playing so much had taken a toll on me and even started to affect my family.
---
Anyways, one night I was in AV with a friend who offered to play my account for me for a few hours while I slept.  I had never account shared with anyone before and I had only said "yea that might be a good idea", and because of merely discussing it I got a 3 day ban just days before I would finally hit rank 14.  I was devastated but also knew I couldn't grind any more.
---
God that was a depressing thing.
---
But yea, as the post title says, your miles may vary for rank 14.  I played forever and had to really work to try to get up there.  Competing with people who could account share without getting banned was annoying and then considering all the other factors involved (long queue times) it can be quite a grind.
---
Not sure if I'll actually attempt that again but who knows.
---
Good luck to whoever tries it in Classic.
---
Please be EU alliance!
---
I think you are sadly mistaken, you just need the eye of divinity and eye of shadow. Eye of shadow can drop around the world from elite demons.
---
LE JEM
---
Or just dont have kids and a 40 hour a week job , I have plenty of time to play!
---
The Constitutional Republic that we had is the closest thing to a perfect system I have seen. The problem is that WE allowed the system to break down by not utilizing our rights and being a lazy and uneducated people. For instance, If you gave people a blank slate. You showed them one candidate's policies and plan, then another candidate's policies and plans. Let them vote on that without ever seeing the political party they are affiliated with and we would have less issues.
---
The problem is we allowed our country to heavily favor a two party system, which is the largest inherent hole in the political ideology of our forefathers, and also why they warned so heavily against it. Instead of having niche parties that reflect the *many* voices in the US, we force people into a "Us v. Them" mentality. This constant deadlock has very few positives, but a plethora of negatives. 
---
Lastly, we let the system become "for profit", which creates a class within which most politicians have to fit into. Hell, when a federal seat got taken by a bartender, everyone lost their minds, and her opponents use it as a negative for her constituents. That's literally the way our system *should* work, and yet here we are. Our founding fathers created a class within society, but they always intended for us to be ruled by the educated, *not* by the elite. Now politics is a way to make money, and not so much a way to help progress our country
---
Hunter noob here, outside of levelling how good can a hunter tanking pet actually be?
---
Like, say at level 60, can they handle helping tanking abit with adds etc. in dungeons?
---
actually pretty true in Tanzania.  I went there to do Kilimanjaro and we stayed in a little walled-off place with little huts and a bar.  The day after we finished we were all celebrating in the nice bar area and a guy walks in with two lackeys who were holding AKs
---
our mountain guide was like "for fuck sake what's he doing here?" and she went on to explain that he was like the local mob boss.  He didn't do much, and ended up leaving pretty soon but I was worried for a minute haha
---
I played Warrior and hunter through my time playing. So I decided to try something new for classic and be a healer :)
---
Except this isnt really true.
---
Most games on private servers even with geared 60's last MUCH longer than the AV's full of 58's we saw on stream. The biggest reason for this is it's very hard to progress on the map unless you coordinate several people to do objectives.
---
With the 1.12 version you are mostly fine as long as you dont have a bunch of people fishing in the base.
---
Even premades on private servers on the un-nerfed AV spend upwards of 20-30 min (Yes, some occasionally do it faster if they are extremely coordinated) as you need to capture towers to have lieutenants despawn, and capture graveyards.
---
On the 1.12 Version the enemy NPC's are just so easy that the only strategy is to rush to the enemy base as fast as possible to zerg down the endgame. The team with the most mages to stop the other team at chokepoints usually wins. It's by far less tactical than the previous versions.
---
I recall ranking on Nostalrius as Horde, and in order to get across the bridge to the Alliance base if the Alliance blocked off the back door was to send in a fully geared tank, with priest shield and shield wall ready and rush for the graveyard in a coordinated assault with at least 25+ players in order to capture the graveyard.
---
It's an entirely different dynamic to the game and it's sad to see we get the same watered down boring faced paced version as we have had in every later expansion.
---
You don't need to kill kazzak for Bene. You need an eye of shadow. He just had the highest drop chance they can drop from elite demons around the world.
---
🤔
---
They didn’t exist in 1.12.1, that’s why they don’t exist in classic. I understand this is debatable but this has nothing to do with the other stuff you mentioned.
---
Isn't https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/d/da/1-2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20071103034323 the patch logo?
---
Why clarify it's a working link? Surely nobody would post a non-working link
---
I love that man. You remind me of me! Same mate, mulgore was the first zone I ever experienced in WoW and it had me hooked from level 1
---
You are a fun person
---
Luckily for you [29/11/11](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0xhMxsLxG0oZVV0o) is the best balance spec for PvP! :D
---
Yea i could use all of my abilities
---
4.00 speed op
---
I'm getting downvoted because 90% of the people on this sub are scrubs. As SL lock with equal gear you dot up the warr, drain life and /afk. Rogues need all their cds, reflector and perfect timing in order to not get caught by the lock, and if the lock is Orc you will just lose most duels by default.
---
&gt;I am not #nochanges but it's crazy to request such a big change from 1.12 for a clear  minority.
---
You mean the clear majority. Most people I see want the pre 1.12 AV. You cant just claim to speak for everyone else just because you personally want the shitty version of AV.
---
Thunder bluff followed closely by Ironforge (but I hardly ever played alliance). Hopefully see you in Mulgore in August mate! :D
---
Sometimes I want to believe that content coming out could be voted by the community.... But then I remember that when the LFG featured appeared in WotLK, and people claimed they wanted it...
---
At that moment I realized that, the playerbase dosent know what they want...
---
His joy echoes through the mountains
---
Honestly don't know if it was in 1.12 or not, was hoping someone who is in the beta would confirm if it's in the beta or not. 
---
I assume though you're implying it wasn't in 1.12?
---
GOOD FUCKING MORNING GODDAMMIT 
---
Wonder if anyone will get this reference
---
&gt;he problem is that WE allowed the system to break down by not utilizing our rights and being a lazy and uneducated people. For instance, If you gave people a blank slate.

---
This absolutely does not work because politicians are not beholden to their promises, and generally don't keep them.
---
A politician will tell you whatever people want to hear to get elected, and then will not represent the people who elected them, they have always done this and always will do this under representative democracy.
---
No party reform or regulations on lobbyists will fix this, though both of those things would be cool.
---
The only way to stop the corruption is to make a system in which power is decentralized.
---
Dragon Isles, maybe? Or Gilneas?
---
THERE WERE NO HASHTAGS IN VANILLA
---
IIRC Arathi Highlands is based off of southern England.
---
They did exist.
---
Dude thank you so much for this post! Everyone seems to hate druid on this subreddit...
---
I mostly played healers since vanilla but never tried druids. I love to heal in pvp and want to try something different. 
---
I like to think that I will be able to fight or run aways from alliance easily with that class in wpvp. 
---
I have some questions... 
---
Did you have to re-spec often between pve/PVP/farming? 
---
How did you farm gold ?
---
Which professions did you have ? I'm thinking of herb alchemy since it's easy to herb as a druid.
---
It was about a massive twitch ego trying to find ways to bully ppl into not killing him. Oogas would no doubt apply
---
Well said, the previous comment as well.
---
At the same time there are a lot of financial decisions that you can never have any clue about. They might need sharding because of financial and technological issues. There are def sectors that any gaming population have no idea about. Gaming developers have limited time and it is about prioritizing and know what to cut off. He doesn't mean that you are stupid, just that you don't have all the information.
---
Lucky...
---
Burning steps is definitely based in my mother-in-law
---
&gt;Inefficent. People with a high-intensity Life that enjoy WoW dont want to waste time in turtle-AVs
---
See the issue with this is that you employ a retail mindset to the game where everything has to be efficient and quick. If you want efficient you can do WSG and AB. AV was the only BG for players that just wanted to enjoy the game and take it slow without constantly caring about maximizing gains.
---
Because fighting alongside the elite wolf riders and giant ice lords for hours is just so much fun.
---
It's bullshit but really not something that I care enough to shitpost reddit for. Blizzard shouldn't try to control how people play the game.
---
Not in 1.12.1
---
In game. You’re gking to physically make the characters.
---
Pretty much yes.
---
Nope, troll bis emote race.
---
and xxdarthlegolasxx

Blizzard "we might consider classic".

/u/murderthumbz  Cya lady you were just my rebound after WoD broke my real love.
---
Ooooooo!  Zinger!
---
And the misogynists are out in force again.
---
There has to be something fundamentally wrong with you if you think people should enjoy getting ganked by three stream-sniping rogues eighteen levels higher than them. And isn't logging off if you get camped exactly what all the PvP server players say you ought to do? She logged, played something else, and came back to Classic later.
---
Nah, gank more, get more reactions and laugh at him.
---
Some people can certainly blame the game. WoW ruined a lot of people who became addicted.
---
It's an image from the article header that was posted on their website when it was released. It's not a logo per se. The same format was used for many news not concerning new patches.
---
What’s funny? Too hard for you? Do you shake in your little boots at the thought of that?
---
Ive actually already done gilneas lol, but I don't really know what to do with it, is it a leveling zone, RP, low or high level
---
give me your thoughts
---
I can say from pserv experience it usually STARTS with the intention to rush, but the majority of the time it’s a mess that turns into  a long turtle.
---
and wasted my precisous farming time onto grills
---
Ah. Forgot about that.
---
Eventually yes, but the Battlenet account is free anyway.
---
You don't play classic for the combat.
---
Sure playing a fire mage in wrath is a lot of fun. I'm actually playing one on a pserver right now. But what fun is there in spamming living bomb on everyone and aoeing them down with instant flamestrikes and pyros, if the rest of the game is shit? BG's are terrible, the dungeons are easy as fuck and most of them have annoying unskippable roleplay, the raids are boring as hell, the 10man vs 25man system is garbage, the balancing is just as bad as vanilla and half the specs are literally made to buff others.
---
There is a gigantique diffrence between a rank10 on a high pop realm and a rank10 on a low pop realm.
---
The diffrence is 5x the amount of work.
---
My wife is fully supporting Thrall bless her.
---
She's jealous because she decided to become a semi successful author in addition to her 9-5.  I left my options open so I get to no life WoW and she has to possibly become a great author.  Sucker.
---
"thousands?" Try millions.
---
I believe it was added later, but it was a long time ago so I’m no use, sorry!
---
Ah yes!  I loved Oxhorn videos!
---
That's not my fearward, i was playing human at this time (y big mistake)
---
Yes they did, they were just not purchasable, but the mounts still existed.
---
I personally don't care, both AV are boring for me except on occasion. But 1. It was changed because people wanted it shorter in the first place and 2. If people wanted it longer why does noone defend and always rush to make sure it's shorter?
---
Reddit posters aren't representative - look at what people actually do in the game..
---
They existed, just were not obtainable.
---
There is so little to learn. Try watching boss kills with a mage POV.
---
And you get hours of enjoyment.  Better value than the crack addicted hooker.
---
Speaking of crack WHERE'S MY BETA INVITE? *Cold sweats intensify*
---
You are not prepared
---
Nah im just lucky i guess :)
---
Booty bay = Rio de Janeiro
---
Booty can refer to the pirates, but also to brazilian girls :D
---
No that's not how ranking works.
---
Play the class you enjoy instead.
---
So! Not everyone is doing AV for fast games. Fast games ruin PvP for those wanting to fight opposing players. 
---
As I said I loved turtling and making it a fight rather than a PVE race.
---
Why not? That's what they said they would do.
---
I think you might want to give it a PvP zone feel, as the story of the worgen vs unded fits well with battleground themes.
---
Essentially, just give the place a feel as if the kingdom is torn due to its population being torn by part of them being undead and the other part worgen. 
---
Or, you could make the outer portion of the city repleted with worgen and mindless undead, and have the city itself set up as a raid.
---
&gt; Sure, but you still haven't made the jump from problem-finding.
---
Where's the issue then? If you agree with Rosewater's assertion that the audience is good at recognizing problems and bad at solving them then why would you want an audience member to go from pointing out problems to offering bad solutions? I'm not sure what point you are trying to make.
---
Maybe not on lower ranks but the higher you get, the bigger the diffrence is.
---
Getting rank 14 of a deam realm is way, way, way less time consuming.
---
I'll be rolling pve, as as many said you won't be battling unless it's an organised skirmish, but you can do that on a pve realm by simply flagging yourselves for PvP. All it means is being ganked, or ganking, neither of which I enjoy. I would absolutely play on a PvP realm if it played out how it's imagined, with an exciting clash of skill every now and again, even if I'm not all that good at PvP, as id learn the skills over time. But you don't learn anything by being randomly one shot or saplocked over and over by someone far exceeding your level.
---
staysafe saw this and hes now able to walk all the way to the roof on the other side lol
---
What are these words you speak?  There's nothing but Classic.
---
Weapons with agi(pref) or attack power are your priority, don't roll on strength weapons. Even a mix of agi/int works well. Other people have good suggestions too, but don't roll on a  melee that has a higher dps because it's really just there to wing clip for you so you can run away and shoot.
---
All good brother we just don't need misinformation around it is a common mistake.
---
Some very well-thought out points, but your theory has one key flaw:
---
They're all low level noobs
---
Maybe not entirely, but WoW's success is measured by its player base, as that's really the only way to determine (at a high level) if it's being considered as "good" or "bad". 
---
So what do we know? At Wow's peak (during Cataclysm), they were over 12 million subscribers.
---
When Legion and BFA dropped, there was an initial spike of subs up to around 10 million.
---
As of there last report, WoW is sitting at around 3 million subscribers. Which sure may sound like a lot, but everything is relevant. Losing 7 million people (about 70% of the active playerbase) is a huge deal. 
---
I think it is totally fair to say there are people who enjoy retail WoW in it's current state. And there isn't anything wrong with that. But that doesn't make it a "good" game. 
---
If we look at this objective analysis, we can determine that (at least generally apeaking) WoW Retail, is in fact, bad.
---
Eye of shadow wasn't added as a drop on elite demons before patch 1.5
---
&gt;Raiding was very very small part of vanilla and the balance shouldn't be shifted too much towards that.
---
Uhm the available content at endgame was only raiding and PvP.
---
Because people who care about things like that are insane. It's like complaining about wanting a version of T2 gear before the graphical update.
---
God help us all if someone makes a guild that has 'Ironforge' in it.
---
Isn't Thor's powers technically Odin's MAGIC?
---
So Thor should be able to handle Superman no problem.
---
He has Hulk and Ironman to assist as well.
---
Decentralization of power is worse for corruption, not better. Every small town I've ever lived in has 10x the corruption of the cities I've lived in. They have less oversight, and more opportunities, and generally a less educated population. The only way to have oversight is to have centralized power. That said, I believe that the federal Government should focus *much* more on oversight, and significantly less on regulation of individual freedom. Let the states each decide how their people live, and let the Federal government make sure the states don't overstep their bounds on certain things, and maintain infrastructure. Will you have a lot less people in the South? Probably. Is that necessarily a bad thing? Undecided.
---
So then Eye of divinity wont drop at the beginning then either.
---
Well you're half right. Ironman is like Batman but he doesn't have the detective side. He's smart but he's not the one that figures out problems that can't be solved with tech.
---
Hi, /u/100plusRG

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0wy5y/shower_thought_replace_west_virginia_by_wow/). 
---
You'll be depriving yourself of many experiences and crazy open world encounters that you simply cannot get on a PvE server by not rolling PvP.  These encounters will drastically out way the negatives of occasionally being ganked by a higher level when questing. 
---
Here is an example of some of the carnage that you'll be missing out on. https://youtu.be/YjG4UpuL84M?t=75
---
Then they might as well not exist because we aren't starting pre 1.12 we are 1.13
---
Again that's not how ranking works. You really should look up how it works.
---
It's based on the % of players in the bracketpool(15hks) so the population really doesn't matter, what matters is the % of no life rankers on your server, compared to the total pop.
---
Has blizzard contacted you for doing their work for them? And offered to pay?
---
Jk, but this is awesome. I hope they consider adding new zones like this. Even if it's just broadening out leveling areas that would be awesome too.
---
O o g a

O o g a

Let's get real.  The kind of nerds foaming at the mouth for Classic rent, have an already dissatisfied girlfriend, and the place they rent is their mom's basement.
---
Join a guild, get loot, disregard pugs.... Until you host a gbid one yourself
---
Exactly, that's why the two class quests shouldn't be possible before phase2.
---
It doesn't end there.  They don't even bring totems or a useful debuff that isn't already covered.  Spriest and enh shaman at least brought more power to the raid.  I don't think the crit buff is enough.
---
Robin yes, but Dick Grayson as Nightwing is one of DCs best martial artists. So he has that going for him
---
It worked!!  I got mine!
---
That cake looks absolutely incredible! Happy bday OP! On another note, f the alliance. Looking forward to relentlessly slaughtering your oomkin over and over again as you stand by and do nothing, because ya kno... ur a boomkin in classic.
---
Then if she needs help with the Wetlands act super confused so you don’t have to help
---
Every ally wants to be Horde on the inside
---
Exactly, and i don't want it to be either. Because hunters getting Rok too early will make them the strongest class in the game lol.
---
Exactly this, the fundamental AV problem is the reward structure. I don't blame people for giving up when giving up is vastly faster honor and rep /hour. If we ever want to have a "good" AV, by which one means a game in which both sides play offense and defense, slowly picking away at each others bases, the reward structure needs to change.
---
Play on pve or stop streaming. Both are her choices.
---
Did one influence another or are they just related ?
---
Not married, in relationship for 14 years, living together (renting flat) for 9 years, gonna play together casually as tank+heal combo. Both can't wait for classic to finally go live!
---
Is female Tauren hitbox like every other race?
---
That's my point?
---
We want a very high population and competitive server. Just absolutely no streamers.
---
I'll resub to retail wow and spamm punkrat of screenshot of my mount to make him more salty.
---
I didn’t hear how to get one
---
 BWL/AQ/NAXX were available in 1.12 but won't be in 1.13 hmm
---
Oh, all good! Believe me I get it. Everybody seems ultra serious about everything, haha. Could easily have been stating that seriously.
---
That hulk is class lmfao
---
Guessing it's for the next stress test on Wednesday 19th June.
---
This^, but in Schofield.  Oceanic ping was awful.
---
Played on (top sepc) laptop due to travelling for work. Absolutely play desktop if you have a choice.
---
Checked out! Thanks
---
I get your point, but the higher the population the bigger the changes that there will be better organized farm groups. Even when the % of hardcore pvpers is the same. Higher pop realms were inmost cases better organized.
---
So as a casual solo ranker your chances on getting higher ranks is bigger on a less organized low pop realm.
---
Im looking from a casual solo pvpers pov. Since I guess OP was asking for that.
---
You are right about how the ranking works.
---
Kharazan was inspired by OP’s dick.
---
I’m 29 slated for thirty in October.... can I fill out an application for early acceptance?
---
Drinking and stuff is really meh I'd like to have a friend's group to do fun activities with like hiking, playing board games or maybe even travelling. That's the real stuff
---
It shows up as a miss though, thus no Overpower proc.
---
Hitting Tauren warriors from now on with the Dsicombobulator Ray. 
---
Let's see that melee range with those lepper gnome arms.
---
Yeah, [he died because he was killed](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/001/593/peopledie.jpg).
---
If batman figured more shit out with Tech instead of trying to be a cop Gotham might actually not be a cesspool.
---
Great work! I just hope that he future of the game looks something like this. I would love for blizzard to release more 40 man content after Naxx because the world of Azeroth is so good and having 40 people would be awesome pushing forward. Especially with new legendary weapons being added to the game.
---
Happily married and will have nothing holding me back the first few weeks. Because we're adults and had a conversation about it.
---
I only played AV because it was absolutely the best way to AFK honor.  My memories of that place are nothing but me under the bridge, but my icon looks like I'm on the map "Defending".  No, I was just watching YouTube.  Thanks for the honor.
---
Before the honor change AV was a tedious grind that was fun maybe once or twice, and this weekend server population is a testament to that.
---
stop trying so hard my braindead friend
---
quod erat demonstrandum
---
I want my god damn mountain deeeeeew!
---
It has a pocket for storing his monocle.
---
The crit buff is mostly bad. Like, threat management is huge. Getting two crits in a row can mean AFKing for about 20-30 seconds.
---
IMO they could just add them to the vendors. Sure this time around more people would be able to get them, but it is nothing that wasnt in the game to begin with.
---
On the other hand you could argue that people who want the old T2 style are similary rekt. 
---
TLDR: I like old mounts, but missing them does not change much, since they were super rare and you virtually saw none of them anyway.
---
Go and look at some of the mounts if you think it's as simple as a graphical update
---
Thats why I'm going horde, plus I love tauren, I just cant decide shammy or druid
---
uh. you know phases != patches right. p1-6 will all be in 1.13
---
Yeah dude I get five weeks paid when my kid is born! Gonna play so much!
---
I have no idea who she is, but if streaming is part of how she supports herself that is the equivalent of saying "just quit your job how hard can it be".
---
Plus I heard the PvE server is pretty much dead.
---
Thanks! Currently downloading.
---
That's wonderful. You were blessed.
---
Man...I just sigh. I was there getting shit on by people for being the stubborn idot who couldn't accept that cross-realm BGs, flying, arenas, cross-realm zones, and looking for raid were going to be great additions. And now, somehow, I'm making the same kinds of posts a decade layer for the ostensible recreation of Vanilla.

Another issue with community votes is that forums, streamers, important players, and other entities can sway the votes in a preferred direction. Unless the voters are all highly interested and have done their research then, like Democracy, it becomes more a popularity contest than a merit contest as voters pick the party they are convinced by.
---
Scorch spam you mean?
---
If that's your argument why are we bothering with phases at all?
---
if this is all going to stay in vanilla
---
then some patches should be large new levelling areas. 
---
new leveling dungeons and quest zones to give alts or new players a different experience from say 30-40
---
Just a joke about divorce. Sacrificing family for classic wow
---
No, I believe it still has the same issues. Just encouraging to still go Tauren, as I will be someone who will do so anyway :P
---
layering = another stpd blizzard decision
---
\#nochanges
---
New raids and dungeons should mostly offer gear:
---
- to make specs like ret/prot paladins, feral/balance druids, etc viable. 
---
- pvp items with fun/useful on-use effects like maybe a trinket that makes you invisible for a few seconds
---
- Alternatives to BWL/AQ items
---
That would make the game quite a bit more interesting and fun imo.  Naxxramas gear should stay the very best of the best.

---
For anyone coming into the game in 1.12.1 (as we do in classic) they were unobtainable. Therefore, in a 1.12.1 world they do not exist.
---
Aside from aging memory. The old client also was not graphically appealing. The legion client they are using, has all the improved settings and such.
---
Oh I put in there I have launch day+3 days after off, and I plan playing non stop, also I will have another 3 days off before they come back!
---
I edited my comment to reflect my mistake. I must have been really tired when I was looking at those logs xD
---
Most of the fun from WoW for me came from levelling, so just try and embrace it and enjoy the journey mate! 
---
The friends you make in classic will be happy to see  [&lt;your name&gt; is now online] and it will make the friendships you form feel more personal. 
---
I don’t think I’m explaining what I mean very clearly, but just enjoy the ride dude!
---
People like you are the reason why we don't have PvP Warfronts in retail and why timers were introduced to BGs.
---
For shame.
---
She isn’t obligated to stream wow classic. There is no satisfactory argument that can be made that convinces me that these hankers should be punished. It’s not harassment as it explicitly part of the game. You either want them banned or you agree with what I said.
---
I have 2 subbed accounts and 1 unsubbed starter account with no games on the bnet and 0 characters created on that account. The 0 character account was created in WOD. 
---
I have zero beta invites on subbed accounts, which are from classic. I have TWO full betas on the unsubbed newish account. Have no idea how this happened. I’ve been testing out dual boxing on them. I can provide SS if you guys don’t believe me.
---
It will be held as soon as he locks down sponsors that don’t care about his recently leaked attempts to defraud the government of almost $1 million.
---
WHAT?
---
Instances and items were still obtainable/available to raid in 1.12.1 even if they were released earlier. Old mounts weren’t. It’s 2 separate topics.
---
Damn!!! Are you in a different country than America? Or just a sweet job?
---
Yes they were, they just weren't sold by vendors anymore, so you had to buy it from someone who bought it back in the day.
---
&gt; Do you really think Classic+ would last a decade with the same level of interest?
---
If Classic+ led to its own new expansions and new levels (which maintain the Vanilla/TBC/Wrath philosophies) then it could have a lot *more* interest than replaying the existing expansions.
---
&gt; Whereas releasing a new leveling tier gives something to everyone, and adds a layer of freshness that would be missing in a 2.5 year old game.
---
I totally agree, but something completely new would be fresher and potentially draw in more people, especially compared to Cata...
---
Lok’tar!
---
Wait wtf? Wow the plot thickens...
---
I want to go. Do they have dinosaurs there too?
---
They intentionally disabled /follow in all battlegrounds afaik...
---
No he didn’t. My point was never even about AV. It was about his use of a shitty fallacy to attempt to squelch a differing opinion.
---
Well, I can’t refute losing 7 million subs
---
I wish they were going to do this OP but sadly i don't think we will be able to get them. I wanted to be an orc on a ivory raptor but sadly that wont be the case.
---
__I didn’t hear how to get one__
---
Exactly. So if everyone starts at 1.12.1, they don’t exist. Because classic releases at 1.12.1
---
Because it's a cosmetic thing, and very few people actually played Vanilla when those were still in, and even among those, likely not many even *saw* one of those (even more so in the EU - we got WoW three months after the US release), so barely anyone remembers - for most people, the updated mounts are "Vanilla", just like no-one gets worked up about the old Ogre models missing.
---
*Personally*, I would absolutely adore the old unarmored models being an option - not time-limited either, but simply as an addition to the regular updated model. Maybe limited in some other capacity, .e.g. limiting to their race, so only Humans could ride unarmored steeds, and only night elves unarmored fast night sabers.

STV is based off of Africa, and Hemet Nesingwary is an anagram for Ernest Hemingway, who, wrote an amazing book "The Green Hills of Africa", which is "The Green Hills of Stranglethorn" quest.
---
There is even an excerpt from chapter four of "The Green Hills of Stranglethorn" which describe a lot of Classic content creator mentality.
---
"...and I thought about *Vanilla* and about what a great advantage an experience of *that game* was to a *player*. It was one of the major *gaming* subjects and certainly one of the hardest to write truly of, and those *YouTubers* who had not seen it were always very jealous and tried to make it seem unimportant, or abnormal, or a disease as a subject, while, really, it was just something quite irreplaceable that they had missed."

LFM UBRS need tank.

this fkn blizzard man
---
Why do you do this? Does that makes you feel happy?
---
Blizzard isn’t re-doing any unnecessary part of the UI. The menus are modern, the raid frames are modern, etc. They’re just re-making the screens that Retail no longer has.
---
Ah right. It always works.
---
It’s ok. No need to engage that guy. 
---
He’s a total troll. Literally upset that people would think their opinion matters yet when his own opinion gets shot down he wants to ascribe authority onto himself and not listen to anything but his own thoughts.
---
I thought it was merely name reservation. As in, you could log into account management and you could reserve up to 3 names on the realms of your choice.
---
Am I wrong? Where did Blizzard say we'd be logging in game and actually making characters?
---
I think for me it’s between ... Shaman, Paladin, Priest or Druid.
---
I think most of these bugs, including the godmode bug might be because of the spell batching
---
DKP minus for not naming is WoW Life Balance

"Misogynists" jesus fucking christ. Because the streamer in question happens to be a woman? You're exposing yourself a bit too much there pal.
---
You cant pick 2 male orcs
---
You're correct.  Obtaining PvP gear was an insufferable grind, and many people who preferred arena would run PvP bots to get the initial gear needed.
---
I assume you’re talking l*hope core. Every single chest giving greens isn’t a thing on Ely.
---
Haha, poor Pserver players that think they can behave like this on Blizzard’s server are in for a rude awakening. So many people are going to get suspensions.
---
Get a standing desk this well allow you to keep playing but have you stand up and have the computer at a height that will allow for that not to occur.
---
To be honest dude It gets old after a couple games. These AV last about 30 min and most of the sidequests / PVE elements are gone. 
---
So both factions form a bus, avoid each other at the center, rush for the advanced respawn points and then kill the final boss. I hope Blizzard will consider a mixed version between old and new AV because it doesn't feel epic at all
---
Nah. The most important part - the content is 15 years old because despite like 8 attempts to improve through expansion they have yet to make the game better. 
---
Of course you knew that. It’s why you had to split hairs on architecture.
---
now THAT is AV not this bs I'm watching on stream
---
they need to do a minor patch to make the content accessible or not, it's not like battlegrounds where the technology already exists to disable them on a whim, they can't just appear a whole raid and all its items and quests at the push of a button.  1.13, 1.13.1... 1.13.5
---
Hopefully I will be able to form arena farm groups without hunter and warriors hah
---
No.
---
Its classic, any $300 laptop will most likely be able to run it on high.
---
I mean, you're just proving the point in the photo. You have no idea, so why are you so sure about your speculations?
---
Oh well, cant confirm now since its deleted but, being able to abuse it is kinda scary even for phase 1
---

Gnelf gnoblin and gnome. Do it
---
I feel like in the time taken to post and read and reply to this you could have just grinder to 10...
---
Yes I love paladins haha I like straightforward specs like retri, shockadin or pompyro. But I ll roll warrior this time so playing around consumables ll be a thing for me
---
Oxhorn? The guy who makes Fallout lore videos? Damn I had no idea he was a celebrity back then.
---
(Don't judge, I didn't play WoW in my youth, and even if I did I probably wouldn't even have known him since I only recently learned English)
---
I was the guild leader.
---
Reminding people that a celebrity is a crook and a fraud and a shitty person is my duty, I take no pleasure in it.
---
You missed my point.
---
I'm saying if we're playing the game as if 1.12 is the beginning, why isn't naxx in the game? Why are we having progressive itemization? The phases are used to recreate the timeline of vanilla and the unarmored mounts were an iconic part of vanilla
---
My brother and I had the same idea! Our guild is called Legacy and will be on EU Alliance side. PM me if you want details! 
---
Best of luck to OP with his guild!
---
This AV server is dope
---
Cancel Spain.
---
It's just so sad, what you are doing.
---
He isn't wrong though.
---
Mainly because rank 10 does not necessarily require being in a premade. While going for BWL will necessitate that I'm in a raiding guild and there are certain standards required (min maxed, consumable farmed, prompt attendance, etc) which I may/may not be able to fulfill.
---
The difference is that the unarmored mounts stay as a status symbol throughout Classic, but the original T1/T2 textures would be very temporary.
---
Honestly sure why not I want the original T1/T2 textures too, but it's not as important as the unarmored mounts. Seeing players with exclusive items and being impressed by them is an important part of Classic that we shouldn't be removing to make some jealous casuals happy.
---
Awesome but expanding on the leveling content too would be great, theres a lot of gaps in classic leveling as it is. Those low level zones could still have reasons for high level players to visit like herbs/ore, a few low level quests that offer unique rewards like niftys stop watch etc
---
"Warriors are unfortunately the worst class at solo pvp"

Funny thing is holy pallies are worse. Yet somehow together they're unstoppable.

I'd really like to see at some point Arthas returning South and attacking again.
---
Aw, we got ourselves a Chris Brown fan over here boys.
---
i mean you need a mage which they will want to go for a belt and a healer. So make friends with a healer and a mage and you are good to go bud!
---
You CAN'T get suspended or banned for ganking/camping. Try again lol.
---
You need 8 tanks for horsemen
---
Hey I’m not sure why everyone is losing their minds in this thread. Or acting like this is a unique spec. I’ve seen loads of offtanks using it. There are many encounters, say in MC, that need tanks who can tag in to take core hounds, garr adds, major-domo adds, whatever, but who can also do a bit of DPS in their off time.
---
You won’t be hitting top numbers but that’s obviously not needed in MC or as an offtank. Just focus on cleaving trash and staying out of the way.
---
I should make one of these for TipsOut.
---
Much better performance.
---
Is this Rich Piana?
---
Do you ever stop and think about your life and what you are doing with it?
---
No one ever deserves to be physically assaulted for something they do in a video game. You’re an idiot. And this is a good way to get you banned from this sub and in the game if you continue the behavior.
---
So no hidden dancing troll village?!? Unacceptable!
---
The thing is up till rank 9 it's fairly easy, you only have to focus up for about 4 weeks (not necessarily grind your eyes out) after and not miss any playing time to get rank 10 as far as I remember doing it on my hunter. 
---
Anyway it's not necessarily about playing time than it is just being doable for me because it's a one and done scenario rather than something that will require prolonged commitment.
---
I guess you missed the people calling her a thot? Or do you consider that acceptable?
---
just make them require exalted, even with your own race. if it's available for a limited time only I dont really care.
---
The people who want them also want them removed at some point during phase 2(if i'm correct) aka they want to be a snowflake for having more time to spend on the game then the average joe. 
---
If added they should require exalted and be in permanently, this is far more true to the vanilla spirit of work reaps rewards then reenacting some idiotic patch time line, that only favours those who have significantly more time at hand.
---
btw, i've gotten the unarmored version on two realms before the patch that changed them hit, on one realm I got it on two races and bought multiple of the ones for both toons, so I def fall into the catagory of those who have far more time at their disposal but still, i'd like to see it imemented differently.

I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy all three. Competence is what will set them apart for me.

What? I’m not talking about the guy PVPing, I’m talking about the guy threatening him with assault. Pserver players say whatever they want without consequence. That shot is not going to fly in Classic.

Lol nothings off limits bud, the sooner you learn that the better off you’ll be.

There was no more epic moment then when fighting Mr. Smite when he stomps you and yells. " AH, You landlubbers are tougher than i though, I'll have to improvise." I loved that so much the first time i heard his voice come out of my speakers. 10/10 Best starting dungeon.

How I reply to that: "Cool, I'm in!"

What I'm thinking: "Whelp, guess they've never talked to my guild.  Here goes!"
---
9 parts about 20 minutes each, for levels 1 to 5. And an intro that is 40 seconds long, that mostly uses cinematics. Not to mention the actual video is literally ripped from his stream. Its not content.

The intro looks good, at least.

Nope. I do what I want and life is good. Right now I’m revealing the truth about a total fraudster. Feels great.

I like the idea. I am hoping for new content after a year or so of classic. I get a strange feeling they will play it safe and go with TBC...

If they did release new content, would it kill retail player base?
---
I'm trying to be but it's a struggle.

Ahh I see :)

Really? That is awesome, thank you!

---
"then it could have a lot \*more\* interest than replaying the existing expansions"
---
Why do you think we are here?
---
People want to replay vanilla.
---
There's a reason the most popular private servers (vanilla or otherwise) are the blizzlike servers. Which are also the reason why we are getting classic in the first place.
---
Honestly I'd love to say I trust them to be able to come up with something completely new and fresh... but we've already seen their attempts at fresh and new in WoD/Legion/BfA.
---
What it comes down to for me is I know I loved vanilla/BC/WOTLK/Cata. I KNOW I want to play THAT game. Sure expansions on vanilla (Classic+) could be pretty cool, I might love it. But just let me enjoy this awesome old game I used to love before you go mucking around changing the world.
---
I am sorry but you already proved all of my points right. Your arguments gets worse every time. If you think that in business your products and services aren't important as a whole but there is "important parts" that only means something you kinda show exactly why companies shouldn't listen the people. People don't understand the big picture. Your posts are the prime example of that. Thank you once again proving my points.
---
How can you forget the energy drinks and the job quitting?? 4 out of 6 stars ;)
---
Hunter does amazing in full t1 and rokdelar and is less reliant on lategame gear so I guess that's the best pick.
---
Also great way to end up on the ignore list of half the server
---
The pleb is the one who claimed he complained /facepalm
---
My grandma plays wow with me and often tells me things like this. Such as Red Rocks in Mulgore being very similar to a place in Utah also called Red Rocks.
---
You call it toxic, we call it justice.
---
Does failing to defend a guy that attempting to steal $1 million of taxpayer money make you happy? How do you live with yourself knowing the people you look up to are con men?
---
patch 1.8 ruined it!
---
Don't do 2hand fury in dungeons, play arms instead.
---
Its a server thing, the streamer has no control over it
---
I know this, from my underground experience in the pserver scene.
---
It's more reliable in the sense that you need less +hit gear. The big one early for 2h fury (iirc) is the OEB from MC (2h sword with +8 to swords). Pre-raid you're going to be decent dps as a fury warrior with some +hit gear either way, though if it's 5-mans you may as well tank them in fury spec and choose who joins the party as the group leader.
---
As a rogue I’ve always been jealous when watching mages farm. Rogues are not great with multiple enemies. That mage kiting and aoe is a beautiful dance.
---
Until Sylvannas burns it?
---
i think you are wrong mate they can still dodge from behind dodging from behind was able to be negated in TBC with the expertise skill pushing dodge off the table. In vanilla you will still get dodges from behind. Misses do not equal a dodge.
---
It’s not bad but without having the hit cap you’re going to miss autos and with 2h you get a lot less autos than dw. Although there are a lot of really good 2h blacksmithing weapons you could farm for.
---
Are you sure about those numbers?
---
I recall reading articles while I still played wow saying the subscriptions were at15 million
---
You analysis is correct, but it misses the most important part : **the RNG part**. 
---
**I will ONLY talk about raid progression**. Once a raid is on farm status, a good geared guild can use Rogues, Warlocks, Shadow Priests, Druids, Fury Warriors, and even Hunter pets as Main Tanks, if they want to have fun.
---
RNG, combined with parry-haste mechanics is what makes Vanilla raids much harder than Retail, where this mechanic (parry-haste) was removed sometime in Wrath.
---
It is not the general mechanics that are making Vanilla raid progression difficult, those are simple and easy to counter with practice. **What makes Vanilla raiding hard is your when your tank dies. And tanks, in most cases, die because spike damage.**
---
A Shield and Board Warrior is the ONLY reliable option for tanks, **during raid progression**, and at least the MT and first OT should, 100%, be Prot Specced. The second OT can be Fury/Prot Spec, but at least 2 of the 3 tanks should be Prot Specced, during progression.
---
A guild that will attempt raid progression with a dual-wielding Fury/Prot or Druid, as MT, will fall behind the guilds that are using Prot Warriors.
---
The dual-wielding Fury/Prot and Druid tank meta from private servers is working because the parry-haste mechanic (which is the mechanic that makes Vanilla progress raiding difficult) is triggered **2.5 TIMES LESS** than Classic WoW. With 5.6% parry on private vs 14% parry in Classic.
---
On paper, this is not a big deal. In reality, it is a HUGE deal. Why? Because of RNG. 
---
Nobody can predict a string of 3-4 crits and/or crushing blows, all triggered with parry-haste. Swapping from dual-wielding to SnB, is a REACTIVE action, and the Fury Warrior tank will most likely be dead before he understands what is happening. Druids have it SLIGHTLY better, due to high armor and HP pool, but the healers might not have enough time to react&gt;cast&gt;land a heal.
---
Warriors using SnB will ALWAYS have Shield Block up (which is a PROACTIVE action), removing all Crits and Crushes. Rarely (due to some speed cast debuffs, or stuns, or other mechanics - than are once in a blue moon) a SnB Warrior will get a Crushing Blow...but if he is Defense Capped, that risk is almost ZERO. Shield and Board Warriors (which will be Prot, because Shield Slam) will suffer MUCH less damage and MUCH smoother that Druid tanks, and especially Fury Warrior tanks.
---
To be able to generate higher threat than a Prot Warrior, a Fury Warrior will have much less +Defense gear, and he will be open to spikes from Crits. Swapping to SnB will, most of the times, be too late. Druids lack the +defense gear in the first place, so they will also get Crits and Crushing blows.
---
The entire point of using Fury and Druids, as tanks, is threat. On private servers it works, because the raid bosses have, as I said, 2.5 times LESS parry, hence, will trigger parry-haste mechanics 2.5 times less. Due to how rare is the incoming spike damage taking place on private servers, healers are able to heal Druid and Fury Tanks. 
---
During **raid progression** in Classic, Fury Tanks are 100% out of the question. SOME Druids might be able to secure an OT spot, but probably the 3rd OT spot. The MT and first 2 OTs in Classic, during raid progression, will be Protection Warriors, in 99% of the cases.
---
A raiding guild in Classic will have 5-6 tanks. And that guild will have to gear all of them, all the time, before anything else. When ZG and AQ20 drop, a guild will need 4 tanks. The additional 1-2 tanks are a safe measure, because tank poaching is a thing in Vanilla, and because one of the tanks might actually stop playing at some point, or wants to take a break (tank stress is also a thing) , or simply wants to roll another class for another role.
---
**However, raid progression is a small part of raiding. Guilds will farm raids every single week in Classic, and once a raid is on farm,  a Druid or a Fury Warrior will frequently tank raids**. But that is only after the raids are on farming status.
---
In time, a raiding guild will slowly drop for 3-4 Prot Warriors and 1-2 Druids and/or Fury Warriors, to 2 Prot Warriors and 3-4 Druids and/or Fury Warriors.
---
So, there will be a time for Druids and Fury Warrior tanks, just not during progression. And this is what players that want to roll Druids or Fury Warrior for tanking, have to understand.
---
**The private server meta WILL work in Classic, but only for raid farming.Not progression.**
---
You said that what I said was the equivalent of telling her to quit her job if I recommended she stop streaming. So please help me understand how this situation would be resolved if hypothetically she required streaming classic to make a living. Would you recommend the Oogas be banned, or that she play on a dead server. This is a question, please try to answer it without devolving into a comment that says absolutely nothing.
---
To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account.

That is from blizzard website. Why you lying?

The greater good.
---
Why was it so bad? I’m planning to get a good gaming laptop for exact same reason. Also need to be able to play from the sofa or will get wife aggro! 
---
If you get one with a large monitor, is it still bad to play?
---
Why are warriors so obsessed with the deep prot specs? This spec is subpar private servers have proven that DW/Defiance is the superior spec for TPS and allows you to still be able to DPS when need to quite efficiently.
---
Sort of ─ imagine if when you toggled PvP in a PvE server you could only see people with PvP toggled on until you toggled it off at an inn.
---
Dodge is still on the table, but it shows up as a miss when attacking from behind, thus not proccing overpower. This is fairly common knowledge.

Hell yes a man of culture. DW/Defiance all day. I will be running this spec from about level 56 all the way through Naxx.
---
It's honestly depressing to see people act like you do.
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game. I did the same thing in AV back in the day, but I didn't design WoW. The gear was nice, and I got a lieutenant general title out of it. I probably wouldn't do it this time around because that seems really boring. But younger me saw what was available and took it.
---
Avoid a huge grind to get gear? You bet. Blame the devs on the grind, and for giving me an opening around it.
---
wow is also 15 years old, the fact that it's still relevant is pretty impressive
---
&gt; something completely new would be fresher and potentially draw in more people
---
You cannot believe Classic+ can out-compete BC and simultaneously hate retail WoW. You can't. That's a logical paradox. BC is the vision of Vanilla WoW taken one step forward. The original design team for Vanilla WoW worked on BC. Features that Blizzard wanted to add to the game on ship but couldn't like Paladin taunt (quoting the guy who literally designed the Paladin class) were added as part of BC. BC is basically an improved version of Vanilla. Meanwhile, any Classic+ would inevitably be designed by the Retail team. You're saying you have greater trust and faith that the team that made Retail WoW could do a better job making content than the team that made Vanilla WoW. If you believed that, you would be playing Retail.

I've heard a few strats for early NE and lots of them abuse dying on purpose several times. I'll be keen to try them all out!
---
Tbh you're not that far off.
---
Except basing a claim that a game is “bad” on sub numbers (or even change in sub numbers) is exactly what the author in the OP is talking about. 
---
You can say it hasn’t performed as well as previous expansions. You can say it doesn’t appeal to as broad of an audience as it did before. Those are objective assessments based on a sharp decline in sub numbers. 
---
You can combine the decline in subs with knowledge of in-game systems and make reasonable guesses about which design decisions caused the decline in subs. You can offer your own personal assessment of these systems and describe how they affected your enjoyment of the game. 
---
You **can’t** say a game is objectively “bad” for the same reason as you cant say it’s objectively “good.” Using player base numbers as the sole metric, Candy Crush is probably the best game ever made.
---
This! People forget that item sets were spec specific. Adding in a set for specs that don’t have one would of course be a change, but I think it would be a good one.
---
reading this post trip  - sorry my grammar and terminology is hilarious hahaha
---
Night Elf hunter was my original character and my main until WotLK. I'll be recreating him as my primary alt in August. Hunters are an amazing class.
---
Pservers have been doing it for 4 years i think blizzard can manage it.
---
still cant answer the question did this all happen within my head or within the/another cosmos
---
They come with 100+ viewers spamming chat and making it impossible to do anything with them there. If a streamer comes to a zone your in to quest you're not getting anything.
---
i do believe you are wrong. Unless this was a private server only thing if you are hit capped you should not miss. Dodges and misses are completely two different things.
---
Does defending a criminal streamer get some brownie points with him? Does he even know you exist? Does he care? 
---
Pretty sure all he cares is that you hit that sub button and give him money so he can repay the people he’s defrauded.
---
Let go of all previous notion of what a male Night-
---
Elf is.
---
Go do your
---
own thing dude, much respect.
---
Leveling in the elf zone is a blast, don't worry about what anyone else, they're just 
---
angry haters.
---
Stick up for male-elves everywhere!
---
His point everyone. Thanks for coming.
---
Agree in DM as the Best!
---
WC has a special place in my heart aswell, but Cruel Barb and Van Cleef - Damn it was good!
---
When you gain a few more iq points and a bit of humility you'll potentially reassimilate into society well.
---
Beating others to prebis is a good way. Getting prebis as a rogue is extremely difficult because you share a lot of gear with warriors and hunters, and warriors will try to lead groups without rogues to get the gear for themselves. So putting in the work, maybe working together with some friends, will give you a good advantage.
---
I mean, I'm as sure at the people who posted those statistics/articles online lol. I only gathered already collected data.

Woooooooooosh

Pay closer attention next time.

&gt;Does failing to defend a guy that attempting to steal $1 million of taxpayer money make you happy?
---
What does this have to do with Vanilla wow? What does this have to do with a duel tournament? If this guy have broken the law we have courts to handle these things. Have he been convicted for a crime? Can you link the court sentence? And even if he was convicted for a crime, what does that have to do with Vanilla wow?
---
I would never!
---
You are correct as the search function would have told you also.
---
Wow that might actually be some people's life.
---
100% agree as a Horde main WC is wonderful. But i think DM is the better crafted dungeon in comparison to WC.
---

---
I don't get why disliking layering leads to so many cluster suggestions, it's literally long term layering that will make you play with people you've never interacted with, are at different pvp and pve progressions and have a completely different community. Layering isnt perfect, but it sounds a lot less disruptive
---
Because it's mathematically impossible to get past them. A ton of people will go to a different server so they don't have to compete with people who can put in 14 hour days into wow.
---
If you want to be High Warlord and are serious about it, you would not choose a server with a bunch of streamers on it. Because if you do, you'd make it clear you aren't about getting it.
---
For fuck's sake I'm not talking about the difference between dodges and misses, I'm talking about the fact that a dodge from behind shows up as a miss in the combat log. It does not proc overpower.
---
Oats. Boiling water, a few mins, eat, done, easy.
---
Usually the way I see 'freemium' implemented it works in such a way that you have full access to the whole content of the game, but are essentially resource throttled, or stuck behind prohibitive timers that you need the premium currency to get around, but you still have access to everything eventually.
---
F2P (at least when it's done right) has you essentially on an even playing field with paying members and all that money gets you is cosmetic/vanity items, or some convenience upgrades.  Basically nothing that actually translates into a in game advantage for the person paying money.
---
I'd think the free level 20 in retail WoW is just a live demo.  You don't pay anything, but the bulk of the games content is on the other side of the level 20 wall, and no matter what you do, you're not seeing it without paying.
---
I'm not crying it's just allergies
---
I'm not saying I disagree with your first statement. But this is an industry that bases their own success on subscriber numbers. Its definitely impressive that it's been around for as long as it is. But that doesn't make it good.
---
Huh, interesting, i've never seen an unknown zone actually warp you to a real zone instead of your default graveyard. I'll have to play with it more when I can! I was only on a level 5 so :P
---
Shouldn’t the reason for this lack of investment be obvious?
---
On your 40 warrior you have an attachment to every part of his power. You know what it took to get all those levels. You know the dungeons and drops and rolls and quests you had to go through and succeed at to get his gear. You remember all the gold your farmed for the mount. You’re personally invested in the character. 
---
A pre-gen WoW toon is soulless. The game only becomes about the combat mechanics at that point, and who cares about that?
---
&gt;though if it's 5-mans you may as well tank them in fury spec (with your 1h and shield) and choose who joins the party as the group leader.
---
This was something I was wondering about too if it would be possible. It's no problem to do this even at 60?
---
How long time wise have the games been going?
---
No idea what the he’ll you just wrote lol, are we supposed to type all that in the search box?
---
Have you tested this on the beta? Because on private servers we would get overpower procs all the time from behind. So unless this is strict to the classic wow beta and you have tested it you are run buckeroobanzi.
---
No, he isn’t. Half my matches are people deliberately pushing and falling back in order to farm kills off each other (which is pointless without the honor system) or the aforementioned hero rush and it’s over in less than 30 minutes.

Where can I find more info on this ‘cluster’ you speak of? Im in the same boat as you and believe layering is terrible, not the best option for players, and blizzard is using this tech because its easy for them to implement and manage because it is pretty much being used in BfA and has been used for a long time.
---
it was a fucking big deal. Even groups would take ages to level for the "smart players"
---
More like a spirit of Destruction :P
---
mage early on, then warlock
---
&gt;Does defending a criminal streamer
---
How have I defended anything? Also, is he a criminal? Please link a court sentence.
---
As a mage you cast frostbolt. If you can handel that youre fine
---
Yes. It was like this in Vanilla and it's like this in the Beta. And it's also like this on plenty of Pservers that strive to be more Blizz-like.
---
It was pretty much /vg/. Everything went down there, no filter. He had to purge it after he became partnered with Twitch for obvious reasons. 
---
Almost positive no one knows about this but a while ago when Alexensual started his personal vendetta against the classicast guys he tried to expose SS by compiling about 100 images of his discord with comments that would get SS in a lot trouble. Nothing ever came out of it though, it was forgotten because SS was a very small streamer at the time since It happened like 1.5 years ago.
---
I'm sorry, are you suggesting mergers are less disruptive for the communities than layering? I disagree heavily
---
Jesus dude this post has so many assumptions it’s annoying to read.
---
can i be your friend?
---
&gt; But just let me enjoy this awesome old game I used to love before you go mucking around changing the world.
---
If they re-release TBC, they shouldn't push that expansion onto the Classic Vanilla servers that launch in August.  Similarly, if they do Classic+ they shouldn't push that onto those servers either.
---
And it's important to note that the devs have said that they'll be releasing Classic Vanilla phases based on community feedback... not using the exact timetable from the original game.  So we could end up with quite a bit less time in each expansion than you're hoping for.  And not meaning to offend, but I'm not sure there'll be enough support to get all the way to a Cata launch.
---
So the way I see it, we can have fresh servers with a few more years of a game that we know we loved the first time, or we can have fresh servers with potentially a lifetime of Vanilla/TBC/Wrath-style content that maintains the philosophies that Modern WoW has forgotten.
---
It's easy to say now that "Just releasing Vanilla/TBC/Wrath is enough", but 5-7 years from now when Blizzard has forgotten Vanilla's core philosophy again and the shareholders are demanding more microtransactions, we're still going to be here wanting the original philosophy to continue.  Now might be the only opportunity to give WoW an alternate history where it didn't get destroyed by the developers' misguided good intentions.
---
I bet if he defends him enough Tips will say his name on stream.
---
They honestly should have made AV like a MOBA match. No advancing until you capture/destroy each GY/tower. 
---
They had so many options to avoid the hero rush meta.
---
I agree with you statement that merging is the worst solution to low pop realms.  Merging destroys a communities by merging them together like they are the same groups.  Currently I am in beta and outside of a FP bug with layering I really have no problems with it.  My issue with it is that streamers have spotlighted minor issues with it (that will probably be resolved prior to launch) and they QQ'd to their horde of viewer who then in turn pour onto every forum on the internet complaining.  Almost none of the people who are mad about this have even logged in yet.
---
Its going to be a long 2 months.
---
So tell me why 90% of my friends back then traded their old mount if the new one weren't better looking. Seriously...
---
I literally just raided through KT on the Dale in the North and it was in fact the case. So if you can provide concrete video proof of this in beta i would love to see it. Until then i am sorry but i think you are wrong or remembering wrong. MR MAGE.
---
Long-term investment for children who can be trained to farm.
---
I've never seen him act like that.  But, I will say this.  I have zero trust for accusations like this lately.  The criteria for being called a racist has been lowered pretty far.
---
AV has a weird design. Sure, AFKing in the battleground is awful behaviour and should be dealt with. But you can fish in AV, and find herbs and mineral nodes. A player AFKing is about the same as someone fishing or just running around looking for the herb respawns. Maybe they need to change the design...
---
It wasn't by design, just done badly as balance is hard (not just the spec).
---
Ench shaman was way better earlier on, they didn't mean it to be unusable.
---
Pala was clearly not meant to be a cloth afk healbot only.
---
Not it wasn't, and no they didn't.
---
Personal experience: Nostalrius was my first time playing vanilla WoW. I had to learn all of the quests and all of the zones. I was playing the "hardest" class to level, a Warrior. I hit 60 after about 8 days /played.
---
That was sped up a bit because they were using TBC exp values (later fixed), but even without that it wouldn't have taken "ages" and it was nowhere near "a fucking big deal."
---
Leveling really isn’t that hard in classic, it takes time but you guys act like it’s like 18 hours a day for 6 months to get to 60. Secondly, classic wow honestly really is just about class, not really skill. If you look at all the retail players who pvp playing classic for the first time, they are better than every classic pvper. Why? As shit and bad retail is, skill exists. You can’t just face roll a warlock or rogue or whatever and just pop all cds and win any duel u want against any class. I truly believe regardless of what anyone thinks, this game is just about enjoying and progressing your character at a time where the game was simple and have to min max based off of class and not skill. That is why we all want to play, it’s simple and fun to progress while having some Grundy hardcore aspects that keep us in the game.
---
Isn’t the idea of a stress test to test what the conditions are like if the area or zone is flooded with people? If they just simply added it as another thing they may not have enough people doing it.  
---
The reason people got beta invites was to be free testers for blizzard, but ultimately it’s for them, not for the players. It isn’t a loyalty reward.  
---
I get that you don’t like PVP, but if they have 2 months of testing to do still how useful is it for them if people are STILL testing starting zones that have been tested significantly more than areas like AV. 
---
I get WHY you wish you could keep playing PvE but I also think it’s unreasonable to think blizz shouldn’t have made AV the only option
---
People here are really butthurt and arguing about layering but what he's saying has absolutely nothing to do with that
---
He's talking about shit like why undercity has all it's vendors bunched together or why the talent system is what it is, or why molten core even exists
---
I have a morgage and my wife just asked me if Id like a potato before I go to work. The catch is the morgage is an aggresive slope with a tent on it. No HOA!!!
---
I hated this on private servers always got whispers as a warrior.  I completely see it's usefulness though.
---
Warrior tier usually IS BiS for tanking
---
The fundamental problem is blizzard designed hybrids to actually be hybrids but then designed everything else in the game for single roles.  In theory it would have been really cool if hybrids spent equal amounts of their time in all their roles, but they don't.  So hybrids in classic will just spend most of their time healing.
---
People are using the time to duel on premade chars instead of AV in reality
---
This is why i have been telling people to play what they want based on flavor over what is the best min/max. I know going into a guild and going to be the main tank as horde i should really be playing a troll warrior. But they are so ugly and i love playing that sweet female orc. I mean granted i will do a lot of pvp so the female orc makes more sense for me. But if i wanted to truly min/max i would be a troll for the sweet berzerking buff.
---
Scholomance is probably base in [this legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholomance)
---
Can you not use the search or scroll for 5 seconds through recent threads?
---
Yes, it's showing up. Not everyone with the option needs to spam the sub with a new thread.
---
**Scholomance**
---
The Scholomance (Romanian: Şolomanţă, Solomonărie) was a fabled school of black magic in Transylvania, which was run by the Devil, according to folkloric accounts. The school enrolled about ten students to become the Solomonari. Courses taught included the speech of animals and magic spells. One of the graduates was chosen by the Devil to be the Weathermaker and tasked with riding a dragon to control the weather.
---
Are you an adult?
---
i can and i did and thanks to how "great" reddit search is it come up with nothing, next time just answer the question without being a dick
---
It wasn't in Vanilla, however I think its a QoL improvement for PvE players thats going to have drastic effect on PvP. Its unfortunate, but that's how Blizzard has always treated the game, PvE &gt; PvP.
---
I think there might be a better way to stay home... Idk, my thoughts I guess... jeeeezus
---
Absolutely. Server merges affect the communities once, when it happens. And it'll have a similar effect to when the layers collapse.
---
However, layering will also be affecting server communities for the 1-3 months that it's in effect. It's essentially playing on several servers at once. That guy you met and quested together at level 10? Maybe you'll never see him again. The guild that would be a perfect fit for you? You'll never know about them because they're on another layer.
---
Plus you get all the abusable "features" of layering which I mentioned before.
---
Like, all of this stuff is super logical. I can't understand why so many people are eager to go against reason to defend Blizzard and a worse version of the game.
---
Yep.  And good on them.  There is no fun to be had in the AV.  It's no different than a fan service game.  It's a service to PvE players who want to think they PvP.
---
True, alone from the numbers it should be about 2,7kg/week.
---
Might be partly "water weight" in the beginning, but if you watch videos of people doing 7 day water fasts, it's basically always 5kg+.
---
Little hard to look up the weight change in 20min videos, but here longer periods:  
---
7 days → [4,9kg/week](https://youtu.be/Orq4k-3t6Ds)  
---
21 days → [4,1kg/week](https://youtu.be/QPHe5pI9qPs)  
---
21 days → [2,8kg/week](https://youtu.be/8ylA5YhmIow)  (low starting weight + big muscles)  
---
10+15 days → [7kg/week](https://youtu.be/w8o-PJjFsrc) (?)  
---
31 days → [4kg/week](https://youtu.be/vR85zGgA1s8)  
---
31 days → [4,8kg/week](https://youtu.be/dbeX-PTaEFM) (numbers from same scale)
---
If you are going 2 handed get yourself an ARCANITE REAPER asap and you will do a lot of damage in comparison to  dw fury. Mainly being the weapons available aren't as good as ARCANITE REAPER until you get to raid tiers. But you can run as full arms or go fury. But BT isnt worth it for dps until you have 700 unbuffed ap. So keep that in mind when going fury.
---
Show me where I have defend anything. Also, can you show me evidence where there is anything to defend? People here are claiming this person have committed a crime and defrauded 1million. Can you show me a court sentence where this person have been convicted of this crime?
---
Then the question would be why didn't they experiment a little?
---
I do realise that class balance was not a thing, should have added that (and honestly I'm glad it isn't).
---
being around for long doesn't necessarily make it good, but potentially being at that sub count doesn't make it objectively bad either
---
my younger brother cannot be bothered with vanilla, his reasoning is that he should be able to play the content he is paying monthly for, but considering the *time* restraints vanilla introduces and the slow pace he doesn't enjoy it but he does enjoy retail for the combat mechanics, raiding and arenas
---
it's a legit pov of the game, and for a lot of people vanilla is simply not good enough
---
It’s fake because it was possible to get R14 gear without being R14?
---
Can you link?
---
Show me where I have defend anything. Also, can you show me evidence where there is anything to defend? People here are claiming this person have committed a crime and defrauded 1million. Can you show me a court sentence or other evidence where this person have been convicted of this crime?
---
What I’m wondering is how people are going to pick servers 2 weeks before launch. I assume everyone is just going in blind and hoping for a relatively balanced, active server?
---
You have to pick the server before you can create a character, right?
---
It's an unspoken threat. If you never work OT for free you're going to find yourself "laid off" sooner or later
---
Did you see any Devilsaurs by chance ? :D
---
He's discussing a cookie cutter build lol
---
Is that a personal attack or something?
---
Single roles? *cough* warrior *cough*
---
TLDR: Good players are better than bad players.  
---
Thanks for such an enlightening post OP.
---
Eyo, another "play the game my way pls" thread. Haven't had one of these in like.. 6 whole minutes, whew.
---
Back in 2004 that was true, but if this sub has proven anything it's that in 2019 there's a lot of elitists out there who are going to min/max their way through easy content and snub everyone along the way that isn't playing a competitive spec and wearing optimal best in slot gear. Surely there will be enough of them to form a raiding guild or ten.
---
How else would you measure WoWs current state if it isn't for its active subscribers? This is how Blizzard determines their own success. Sure there are many other factors that will play in to how you might feel about it, some people might love it, other might hate it. But subscriber numbers tell a really easy to read story. 
---
Think about when you go to watch a movie, or play a new game, and it has reviews. A lot of those review will not actually tell you why they liked or disliked something. In fact, some sites (like steam) only let you thumbs up or thumbs down something, there is no scale. Most people use reviews as a way to determine if they will want to buy something.  It isn't a perfect method, but a lot of people do it.
---
WoW is an MMO that is ever changing. The report on subscriber numbers is almost just like reviews. We know when BFA came out, WoW went up to around 10 million subscribers which is absolutely incredible. However, the game hasn't been out for more than a year, and we are now down to 1.7 million subscribers as of last report. Idk man, but WoW isn't doing good.
---
AV is definitely the "You think you do, but you don't" of classic wow
---
This makes sense. I wonder then why they didn't go with having support classes as a primary role, giving players significant buffs or enemies debuffs based on actions.
---
I noticed on this sub that people are trying so hard to tell other people what they should enjoy in the game. But what they don't seem to understand about any video game is as long as you're doing what you want, you're fine. Nobody really cares if you agree with others about what Classic is about. The only hardcore mode left in Classic is speedrunning and speedkilling and meme specs hurt that. If you want to be a normie scrub that completes content in inefficient ways, fine, but don't gatekeep the game for the rest of us.
---
Unless it’s like a warrior or something there are going to be compromises for raiding. Mage just spams frostbolt. Hunter just weaves autoshot etc. Most classes can be made to sound bad by their pve limitations and rotations.
---
Warlocks are super useful and in very high demand.
---
This, exactly this. 
---
So many people are talking about BiS and the perfect talent setup, like just show up, that's the hardest part in vanilla. That and threat management for dps
---
We always had hunters pulling stuff so we can kill everything faster. Basicly bringing the next trash to tank when the last one dies.
---
You are spamming thousands of people because you refused to write 'stress test' in the search bar and sort by new - which definitely shows threads about it..
---
You think it's fine because it's just you but every single person like you is wasting a bunch of time of thousands (or at least hundreds) of people out of laziness.
---
Also I did answer your question, anyway.
---
A job I just quit did this to us for 7 months.
---
You compromise and get 2-5 ranks. Wanna be more efficient? Make more keybinds. I counted myself as having 65 keybinds on my priest in vanilla. There are probably 10 more binds that I could use relatively easily and a potential 30+ more if i got myself an MMO mouse.
---
Using the modern API is probably the best change they've done in Classic. Not only can you do a lot of things, like targeting, a lot better in addons, but I'm really fucking glad that using a dispel macro on my scroll wheel, spamming it while not looking at my screen, is no longer the safest and most efficient way to do chromaggus  as someone on dispel duty.
---
*Looks at watermark*
---
*Looks at username*
---
Get out dude
---
Why are there no quests?
---
 Zzzzzzzzzzz
---
People over value talent trees in vanilla... specialization usually you get 1 or 2 useful abilities and a few minor improvements such as damage increase or efficiency. Which may net to 10% increase in damage. 
---
The real determining factor in how your class will perform is gear. A shadow priest could heal BWL as long as he had they had the gear. Most hybrid perform really well early in vanilla is because the gear discrepancies aren’t as severe. Once you start getting raid get hybrid gear generally force them to heal.
---
I have to do it anyway...I'm not doing it just to stay home.
---
They experimented a lot. There are so many changes between launch and 1.12. They just didn't manage to hit a good balance - it clearly gets better though as TBC Is significantly more balanced. 1.12 is still more balanced than 1.2 etc.
---
i want to see six hot loads on my hat NOW
---
I always hear about how AV in Vanilla would last for Days. Kinda disappointed tbh
---
“you do deserve a swift knock upside the head for sure. Lolol” the fact that you take this seriously just goes to show that people are uber sensitive on the internet lol
---
Makes me want to start a guild that's mostly about being a decent person and showing up and killing monsters together.
---
Look how Elliot Rodger turned out post wow.
---
From what I’ve seen the price seems to fluctuate between 3-6g a piece. It’ll definitely be a nice way to earn some gold early on since the set is bis for quite a bit.
---
I would make sure there's a variety of armor weights and weapon picks in my raid group, I sure as hell dont want loot going to waste
---
On the contrary, I found the early ones to be a tad cluttered!
---
What language is that?
---
&gt;finatical about the gear progression, eg rokdelar and benediction etc wont drop until AQ.
---
Any link on this bullsiht? The items came out in patch 1.4 which is phase 2.

That sounds like a fantastic idea

---
The hell are you going on about? Of course you saw the same people consistently. It’s how the server communities/guilds/culture was formed. It’s how I met friends while leveling that I still speak to until this day. 
---
Also, funny enough “a few month” is one of the upper limits for a chronic ailment. There are some ailments that are considered chronic as few as 2 weeks. Chronic pain for example is one of the longer “chronic ailments” and is exactly 3 months.

Even if he's lagging, physics are still simulated client side. So even if internet went down, he would fall.

Oh my god!! They should do something about this!!

Found the entitled elitist

Sure, you are more than entitled to feel that way. I'm only making my argument based on the facts I've laid out. And I'm only using Blizzards own measurement for my conclusion. Going from 10 million subscribers down to 1.7 in less than a year, is incredibly bad. I'm not disputing that there are people who enjoy it, or even prefer it, but to ignore the sub numbers because your brother still likes it, doesn't really prove anything.
---
Nearly 90% of players have unsubscribed from the game since the expansion launched.
---
I don't remember saying they were better or worse looking
---
I thought with the new client it is a mix between input from the server and client side.
---
Well, yes, however I cannot confirm or deny that the amount of addons I'm running in retail is what slows it down.
---
Honestly the entire honor system was a failure in classic and AV itself is horrible. It's too bad people are so hyped for #nochanges because I would much prefer RBGs in classic over the honor system for higher PvP gear.
---
unleaded fuel is still fuel
---
Yes it's very common to begin raiding as 2H Fury with an Arcanite Reaper, especially on Horde. Then if you pick up a BRE you can use it until Naxx.
---
US Horde!
---
That's like a core part of the vanilla gameplay lol. Sounds like retail might be a better fit for you, where you don't have to talk to people at all.
---
I have seen this claim a couple of time. Can you please show me evidence, maybe a court sentence where this individual have commit a crime?
---
I low key wish I had friends nerdy enough to do this for me
---
I love how you immediately turned around after landing, like "I wanna go again!"
---
What the fuck does WoW have to do with him not being able to talk to a fucking girl and have sex
---
because it answers a real problem that server merges cannot answer
---
mergers happened before and never worked well, free transfers happened before and never worked well
---
layering is not perfect, but mergers are even less so
---
You're introducing a large amount of people into a new server, it's not a one time problem, its a long lasting change to the economy, the guilds, the pvp and the pve
---
with layering the problems can also be long lasting, but everyone will share the same AH, the same pve and pvp progression and there won't be any random forced name changes and community change
---
I think it’s probably a gear issue. In full T1 I added landslide to my runs, and could do all 4 bosses in 12 mins, so 5 runs per hour. A fresh 60 might not be able to fit all 4 in 12 mins, or maybe just struggle killing him, so that’s why most probably leave him out.
---
Hopefully there is beta access inside that cake. Happy Birthday my friend! Looks awesome.
---
Can you post them? Its interesting

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0xm1l/will_they_ever_learn/).

OEB will be Phase 2. BRE however drops Phase 1 and is BIS until at least AQ.
---
sure thousands, not everyone in the sub will get a notification about new threads, i don't for example, most people don't if you did that's down to your options.
---
and while you did answer my question you was still a dick about it, this is exactly the kind of attitude that people like to avoid and hope wont be in classic, you don't need to respond every post but if you do you can just give a clear answer and not throw a toy out the pram before giving your answer. clearly if i had found the answer when searching i wouldn't have posted the question it takes less time to be civil and just answer than it does to act like a hard done by muppet, the amount of people on this sub that can't seem to understand that is astonishing considering they are the same people that keep posting about not liking the toxic people on retail only to become toxic themselves

With the natural graphic scaledown you'll get a pretty healthy performance increase.

---
This is not correct, but obviously both make good healers by the fact that they are healers and don't have a "hybrid tax" when healing. 
---
Druids are objectively the best threat tanks, even on horde with WF totem, even with silly gear warrior can't keep up with druid.  Cat can keep up with hunters at all tiers, but I'll grant that the druid will have to put in an order of magnitude more effort to make it work.
---
Enh and Ele aren't going to find a spot in a raid unless they leadership is feeling charitable, but Ele is legit a monster in PvP past a certain gear level.  Enh is a fun gambler spec without the raw power of other classes, but if you know what you are doing you can make certain classes' lives hell, especially with purge/shock spam.
---
This is spot on. 
---
Although I know a lot of the theorycrafting and BiS talk is mostly a.) boredome because people can't play yet and b.) just for fun, there is a certain % of people who get obsessed over tiny details when as you say, the far harder aspect of raiding is the social organisation and getting 39 people not to stand in the fire.
---
If anyone seriously says "sorry you can't come to ubrs with us because you don't have BiS" they can go fuck themselves.
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
Might not be in this case with the shitty layering system.
---
There's 2 different ways.
---
Option one: "Git gud", we're in a world of gaming filled with absolutely terrible players, not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just the way it is, however it does come with the upside that it's incredibly easy for a skilled player to stand out, if you stand out, people will start asking you to join.
---
Option two: Put some effort into asking guilds to join them.
---
I did it so next time you'll remember to search first and maybe not waste someone like me's time.
---
Let us know how it goes after week 1.
---
I would argue that my post had a little bit more nuance than that but thank you for your summary
---
We will see if they do, because of 2 events that will take place BEFORE launching :
---
1. The release of realm list
---
2. The name reserve on August 13th.
---
The realm name list will be known before August 13th. And that list will be what Blizzard ESTIMATES to be enough for Classic. However, the reason they are opening the name reserve option, is that they might be wrong, and there might be much more players than they expect.
---
Depending on how many players will use the name reserver option, we will see if Blizzard ADDS more realms at launch, compared to the realm list released prior to August 13th.
---
I can say, with almost 100% certainty, that there won't be new realms added POST LAUNCH. Unless some kind of miracle happens, and Blizzard is dead wrong in their estimation.
---
Here is how Blizzard doesn't need to add more realms post launch, even if the influx of players is 50% bigger than Blizzard excepts. This is just an arbitrary example, but you will understand that is perfectly doable and realistic.
---
Blizzard launches 10 realms for Classic (the region doesn't matter, it's an arbitrary example). Blizzard estimates a 50% dropout post launch, before the realm population is comparable to Vanilla. I say comparable, and not the same, because a realm can very well function with 2k concurrent players, or 3k, or even 4k, without anything changing significantly.
---
So, in this arbitrary example, Blizzard is expecting between 20k and 40k players to remain, after dropouts, and 40k to 80k at launch.
---
Now, lets say that there will be 50% more players at launch, so between 60k and 120k, for our arbitrary example. We still have 10 realms. Blizzard will simply add additional layers, for launch. Post launch, once 50% of the players leave (again, this is arbitrary), there will be between 30k and 60k players left for 10 realms.
---
This will put the number of concurrent players, per realm, between 3k and 6k concurrent players, most of those 10 realms having   between 4k and 5k concurrent players. 
---
As you can see, even there will be 50% more players than Blizzard expect, with layering and a slightly larger population for Classic, compared to Vanilla, 4-5k concurrent players per realm is more than acceptable.
---
Now, the post launch period is commonly known as the 3 months period. However, there will be additional dropouts in the first year post launch, albeit not as big as in the first 3 months.
---
When you consider this, the previous 4-5k concurrent players per realm, will drop to 3-4k, and in 2 years, to 2-3k. Still, more than acceptable numbers for a healthy Classic realm population.
---
Because Blizzard can add layers and modify the layers population, and also using their metrics gathered in 15 years (dropout rates, player daily/weekly/monthly activity, etc. etc.) AND the name reserve option (best metric that they will have for Classic before launch), I am 100% sure that what realms will be at launch, will be the only ones for Classic.
---
Unless, as I said, some kind of miracle happens, and there are at least TWICE the number of players that Blizzard estimates. But I have hard time to believe that Blizzard, with all their data, will be off by 100%. By 10%, or 20%? Maybe. But as you could see, even a 50% off (which is close to impossible) is going to be manageable, without creating new realms, post launch.
---
My arbitrary example also leads to the same conclusion, even if the dropout rate is 30% or 80%. There won't be additional realms post launch, unless the kids from Fortnite flock Classic realms on August 27th.
---
Absolutely massive and intimidating as hell for the inexperienced?
---
The only thing I'm concerned about optimizing is the server so roll on.
---
the hardest part is getting 25 of the 40 ppl to do well enough so that you dont wipe on easy decurse/dispel mechanics.
---
a raid of 40 meme'rs will still be a shitty experience, no matter how "easy" the content is, people will fail on the simplest of mechanics.
---
I 100% agree with this. I should have added this. 
---
I gave the talent example because those 10% increases could be make or break. And if made the right way, you could have spell power increase melee damage output, helping both causes.
---
Then again, gear changes your entire playstyle.  Hmm...gives one much more to think about.
---
If the fan base has cynical reactionary theories about why blizzard did something AND Blizzard actually has better reasons for making those decisions.....................oh I got it! Tell us.
---
There's always been some weird bits of geometry there that are invisible, that got removed in Cataclysm. However the geometry there never allowed you to stand on it as far as i'm aware. You can see the geometry on a pserver by jumping off at the exact same spot, your camera will momentarily zoom in all the way as you've passed through a wall
---
Found the elitist
---
Thank God
---
Ahh, ok. Seems they decided not to add radical changes until the expansion.
---
What do you think this is a fucking fairy land ?
---
Because I was stupid and everyone else was doing it
---
Not with the mob boss there.
---
How do people in this sub feel about select QOL updates applied to classic+?  Say in the realm of dual spec, class balancing (maybe not hyper balanced but making unused specs more viable like balance druid, elemental shaman, ret pally).  Leave them the same till Naxx then with the new expansions give players a dynamic way to make their character better with spells or abilities that they have to earn through quests?  Warlocks learn UA through a warlock specific quest.  Druids learn Lifebloom by a rare elite mob book drop. ect.
---
They confirmed at blizzcon this wouldn't happen.
---
How? By calling him out on his elitist attitude?
---
Dang I didn’t expect so many people to get triggered by this. It’s important to note he is NOT saying the player base is always wrong about what features are good or bad, fun or un-fun - the player base is the ONLY stakeholder who can decide that and he reiterates that a lot throughout the book.
---
What he’s saying is the player base inherently does not know WHY a feature is implemented or cut, and often reacts like they do which predisposes their feelings toward these features. 
---
Layering, good or bad, is happening. And it’s happening for specific reasons that COULD be financial, resource driven, or out of a desire to handle the “tourist” problem, or any other number of reasons. We just don’t know, but to just assume it’s because the developers are lazy and totally out of touch is ignorant and short-sighted. The point of the excerpt is that while we as players should always express our concerns and desires, we should do so in the context of not having the full story.
---
But this is the Internet, apparently people don’t like being reminded they’re not omniscient.
---
Interesting. My girlfriend just told her husband she writes novels while he plays video games.
---
Imagine waiting years to play Classic
---
...Then proceed to have a "leveling route", the fastest way to skip the entire game, to get to the point where you farm the raid, to the point that you run of content.
---
Most people have no learned that min-maxing and "optimal play" is what ruined MMOs. Its why the genre is no longer attractive for anyone but the hardcore. No shit, you turned the games into jobs and tasks and then proceeded to hate them.
---
Max members in less than a day
---
Amazon
---
I don't really understand though, because you're usually going to use a different build for levelling than at endgame anyway.
---
\&gt;Some extremely good players are going to play a meme spec and kill you for the humiliation factor.
---
I think this is if you are not playing correctly at all, and haven't researched your classes role, like if you played a mage and did less damage than a ret paladin. I don't think this is the same as "Being bad vs being good".
---
I think this is because by the looks of it, it shouldn't take much to beat a meme specc. That might be why they're called meme speccs.
---
as i said i did search and it come up with nothing, maybe it didn't get the right amount of spaces or chant the correct spell to the get reddit search to give me what i needed but doesn't change the fact of you saying use the search 3 times when i said in my first post that i did will change nothing.
---
as for wasting time, if your time was that precious to you then you wouldn't be browsing through reddit you would be putting it to use elsewhere
---
This feels more like a "play how you want" more than a "play my way"

I think you're right that the important metric is how often the tank dies.
---
&gt; Nobody can predict a string of 3-4 crits and/or crushing blows, all triggered with parry-haste. 
---
The entire point of my post is that you can predict the relative frequency of these things. Saying X is Y times as likely to happen compared to Z is a lot more interesting to me than saying, "It's a HUGE deal."
---
It doesn't happen instantly, cos they aren't farming honor or rep. 
---
Thing is, in the real vanilla everyone is intrested in quick bgs, cos majority of ppl aren't doing bg for fun but to farm.
---
So it makes sense for both parties to just rush. its even better to lose quick, and get to the next one, than have a long av. Economics dictate how the bg gonna look.
---
Depends where you're from surely. I don't find going to any where in the US a lot more "exotic" then say Norway as I can reach Norway after a bit on a boat and a train/bus ride but the US is  hours by plane. If OP is from say New Zealand this list makes perfect sense.
---
Peezie? What a coincidence haha
---
Fraud.
---
I mean, both of their only REAL "superpowers" are being super rich. But Stark is also smart enough to build any kind of weapon he needs to get the job done and go toe to toe with anyone, including the Hulk and Thanos. Whereas Batman just buys boomerangs and grappling guns and makes them bat shaped. Being a good detective isn't gonna help him fight the Avengers, which is what's being discussed.
---
Lol at people saying you will end up on ignore lists. Sad what retail have done to the game. 
---
Getting random whispers to join a group happened all the time in vanilla, part and parcel of getting a group together back then.
---
You know you have a great life when all that isn't necessary but you still have all the time in the world to play classic.
---
We all have a type
---
Lol. Hi dude.
---
Wooosh :0
---
That is sooo much mana drained :D
---
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK PATRICK!
---
I'LL TAKE A BREAK WHEN I'M DEAD!
---
Depends on what you consider "helping tanking adds", if you mean "oh shit we pulled a pat, let me send my pet on one and sacrifice it to buy us a bit of time to prevent a wipe" then sure, that's just good play.
---
However if you mean "this is a 4 pull, we'll CC one have warrior tank 2 and pet tank the 3rd" then no, the pet will get smashed.
---
Spreadsheet analysts
---
Not possible, he is a human. Without min max gnome it’s impossible to do anything
---
That sentence makes no sense. Where do you think you are right now?
---
&gt;because it answers a real problem that server merges cannot answer
---
But you want to introduce an even bigger problem to kinda sorta fix a minor one. It's a case of weighing the pros and the cons, and when you step back and consider that, layering is the clear loser.
---
&gt; Can you not use the search or scroll through recent threads?
---
&gt; Yes, it's showing up. Not everyone with the option needs to spam the sub with a new thread.
---
I don't deny it is a sharp tone but how is the above more rude than him calling me a 'dick' when I am after all helping him.
---
Which is exactly what hapenned and why blizz made those changes, nobody was playing it and even the unnerfed state people WILL rush it because it's the most efficient way.
---
The problem isn't the battleground, it's the players. But delusionnal people like OP don't notice that.
---
where have you gotten those numbers? was under the impression blizzard wasn't releasing sub numbers
---
Haha the odds of us both seeing this post
---
I’d say it’s a low level starting zone for Worgen, and they’d be funneled to Silverpine against Undead. But that might be a little early for a contested zone since no other race hits one till 25.
---
this post wasn't really for people that have spent hours and hours theory crafting their character before the game even comes out
---
Lol love it
---
yah its not that great tbh
---
Why did you delete all your messages ?
---
BeethovenTheMage submitted the article, but I just read through the entire legal brief. 
---
While they may not be \*criminally\* negligent, what happened is just as bad. So semantics.
---
Basically, FTR secured a contract to construct a building for a community college in Los Angeles county and submitted bills for the work done. Except the work was never done.  The board of trustees for the college banned FTR from doing any work for the county for a period of five years
---
FTR (And TipsOut personally) filed suit against the board for payment, and also filed a SLAPP lawsuit against the board to prevent them from participating. He alleged that racist remarks were made against him and that the board had illegally debarred his company from construction contracts. Because of all the bad publicity (The LA Times even did an article on the fraud), FTR's reputation was ruined and nobody would lend them money anymore, since Tipsout had personally secured many of the loans FTR had used, he was in the hole for around $25 million bucks before FTR filed for bankruptcy. 
---
What \*ACTUALLY\* happened is that Tipsout made the stupid mistake of making the SAME claims of racist remarks (To the letter, read it, its in the final legal ruling) against a previous client he sued for non payment after the work hadnt been completed and the appellate judge called him out for it.
---
The board of trustees had filed an anti-SLAPP motion against FTR because FTR had threatened to sue each board member individually if they didnt drop the debarment, and the initial trial judge denied their anti-SLAPP motion. 
---
On appeal, the trial judge was reversed and the anti-SLAPP motion was upheld, and it reaffirmed that FTR's allegations of racism were an intimidation tactic and upheld that FTR's debarment was deserved and ordered everyone to pay their own legal fees. 
---
So yeah. Not a "criminal" in the legal sense of the word, but he's still a piece of shit.
---
I hate to say it but you're going to be very disappointed. I remember years ago when I quit Cata and decided to start on vanilla pservers I was hellbent on playing a shadow priest. I was a shadow priest main from TBC until cata. All my friends warned me not to. The server's forums warned me not to. But I didn't care, how bad could it be? 
---
Oh, I learned. And sadly you will too.
---
Hemorrhage is a cool build and it feels fluid in terms of energy used vs combo points generated
---
Fuck their honor gains. If they want quick matches go do wsg or AB. If I can get people to turtle, I'll get people to turtle. That's fun for me so who are they to say their fun is more important than mine
---
Show me where it says his name and the crime.
---
Shots fired!
---
Sure all the way through to cata is highly unlikely, no offence taken, i was probably reaching there. But TBC/WOTLK? not too far from the realms of possibility (that would be my vote).
---
As much popularity as the classic movement has gained, do you really think splitting the community 3 ways would work or be profitable to run? At this point in time Blizzard hasn't thrown in the towel with retail... so theoretically we'd have a retail playerbase, a classic playerbase and a classic+ playerbase? Even if there was enough player interest to give all these servers life and individual community, think of the server cost for blizzard. And that's assuming the process doesn't leave a trail of dead servers behind it.
---
"It's easy to say now that "Just releasing Vanilla/TBC/Wrath is enough", but 5-7 years from now when Blizzard has forgotten Vanilla's core philosophy again and the shareholders are demanding more microtransactions" ... maybe this is the main difference in our perspectives. I believe that's gonna happen whether we take a chance on classic+ or not. So why not go with the guaranteed? Atleast then we'd have a source/standard to hold them to.
---
I know I loved vanilla through to wrath, so why not stick to that formula. Because I've been learning this past couple of months that no good comes from diverging from your source material (fuck you D&amp;D where ever you're hiding! \*shakes fist in freefolk\*).
---
Also the whole alternate history thing probably won't have the same impact as the original story. WoW originally was fleshing out a pre-existing world with pre-existing stories based in the Warcraft universe, on games people had been playing for a decade. It came with built-in depth &amp; history.
---
Haha, recruiting for that is not as simple as it sounds...
---
As you level up you'll need less rank 1 and 2 spells so you can dismiss them as you go. Late game I never ever used a rank 1 spell bar PVP spells like Psyhic scream. But that's an entirely different setup.
---
You can read the fucking court transcripts and articles for yourself.
---
Same... had a guy at work talk About no changes for almost an hour...
---
Rofl biggest overkill in the history of gaming
---
You can predict the frequency, MATHEMATICALLY.
---
You can't in game. Because it is randomly generated. And that makes Druids and Fury tanks, that lack defense and shield block, open to be 2 shotted before the healers can save them, because they can get critted 3 times in under 5 seconds, due to an unlucky parry-haste and crit string.
---
I still have memories of as a kid waking up at 7 a.m at summer, instantly sitting in front of the computer and listening to The Burning Crusade login screen music and having chills. It's just things that you can't forget.
---
You probably also don’t pick up on people’s sarcasm do you?
---
Nah, I'm getting Ironweave and speccing into a searing pain tank.
---
Shit is too easy on Official Classic AV, they fucking level 58 with blues. they should be completely raped by npcs.
---
The reason is on beta they don't rush, cos they aren't farming honor or rep. On real vanilla most ppl aren't playing bgs for fun but they farm stuff, so it makes sense to rush things cos its more profitable, basically noone intrested in the long avs.
---

“Let’s talk about dessert”

“Honey it’s  over get the hell out”

Also, furious howl cd lines up perfectly with multishot cd, so you have really good scaling on the buff.
---
Granted, I haven't mathed out to see if that makes up for it on your damage alone.
---
good PSA
---
As an extension to this, I would highly recommend everyone join their servers world channel by typing "/join world" whenever you make a new toon.
---
I like how none of the updates increase the level cap, just expand on what is already there. I wonder how gear would work if we forgo increased level caps entirely in possible future updates to the game.
---
They've tried that a few times to get down on hacks and bugs, but it always results in rubberbanding (the act of your character teleporting to where you once were because of lag), so we still have the same movement as we did 15 years ago
---
i think Dire Maul won't be at the start
---
Slander? LOL
---
Are you kidding me? 
---
Its not slander if its \*COURT RECORD\*.
---
Lol..
---
This guy.
---
Reality is going to be painful.
---
I feel like AV should be overhauled. The concept is there, but the particulars of the mechanics, victory conditions, etc. seem to encourage either endless grinds against turtling or cheesy "stay right and rush the boss" strategies.
---
They need to get a few designers in a room and give them the freedom to do something radical to hopefully get AV to fulfill it's promise.
---
That is not the point of what I said.
---
Isn't The Onion supposed to be satire? It seemed like a perfectly accurate article to me.
---
Happens all the time in private servers. Sometimes I even reply yes and randomly do a dungeon.
---
He *owned* the company. He wasn’t just an employee.
---
Been married 5 years, met her on wow actually during Wrath and got married a bit later. We are both going full ham. Grubhub is going to make a lot of money that week for sure.
---
I respect high-level trolling. These guys put in a lot of effort and they are good players as well.
---
It's not going to be any hybrid (Dr/Pa/Sh/Pr), hunter, or rogue spec.  Hunter and rogue will be over-represented, and the demand for hybrid DPS is tiny compared to how many people want to DPS on hybrids.  Warriors will be over-represented but geared Fury warriors will be in demand if you somehow get BWL gear.
---
I'd say roll warlock or mage.  The only real question is whether all the people saying they're going to roll warlock actually do.  If it's like private servers, they won't.  Then again mages and warlocks compete for gear and are both 1 button raid dps specs so it's a toss-up.
---
I'm doing my part.
---
The anti out-of-bounds tech simply disconnects you when the game thinks you're out of bounds. That is in Classic, i've fallen through the world and gotten DCed. But that only affects terrain, glitching through or under or whatever with buildings is fine and won't DC you
---
Really is. I stopped playing in 2014 during MoP and haven't logged in ever since. It really left a void. I remember back in BC and wrath waking up excited to log in.
---
I’m going sp/imp for aq
---
Sorry mate, I will continue to whisper people politely to ask them if they would like to kill dragons. This is an MMO.
---
If you look up "classic make aoe grinding" you'll find plenty of stuff, [this is what you wanna go for](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/AAADIw8I) at level 21 to start aoe grinding. With the Improved Blizzard they'll get slowed enough so you can kite them around. Note that you'll first have to make sure that there aren't any casters, otherwise it'll end up bad for you.
---
He replied to the other guy, but is mostly due to 2 reasons
---
  1] people are assholes, and they DO find it fun to corpse camp lowbies. Like the shit fest you hear about gankers in EvE, who even find a way to kill you in "protected zones" its a game to them, and they play it. Or in Elite Dangerous, where groups will spend hours tracking down 1 streamer just to hear them cry like babies. People in WoW just love to make you miserable, because thats the game they play.
---
  2] they hope you call your guild, or call up in general, to bring friends or others, and start a true world PvP brawl like you often hear about. I.E hillsbrad fights.
---
  3] a mix of both. They're bored, and will gank anyone flagged, because PvP. And if a fight starts up from it, its a bonus.
---
2 weeks notice August 9th?
---
It’s not bad
---
I raided hardcore on a gamin laptop, sitting on the couch.
---
But, a desktop is much better, more ideal.
---
A laptop is doable though, and it’s the route I’m going again when classic drops
---
Wat
---
So true. I mean i know it's the onion and all but adult life with adult responsibilities is infinitely more depressing than being a kid!
---
Technically it came out in 2001
---
So you're telling me dinosaurs are still fucking alive?!?!!
---
I think you're holding classic to a really weird standard. What game is currently on the mmorpg market that will give you the play time / cost ratio that classic will give you until the end of Naxx? You could theoretically argue classic is free... Why does classic need to last "years" to be considered a success...
---
Oh wow I’ve never seen a post like this. 
---
“Guys I never did naxx or cthun in vanilla, I’ve never done naxx or cthun on pservers, but I don’t want to worry about my spec and I want people to carry my shit enhance shammy. So boo boo elitists guys play what you want. You can TOTALLY do naxx with a Pali MT!”
---

&gt;Druids are objectively the best threat tanks, even on horde with WF totem, even with silly gear warrior can't keep up with druid. Cat can keep up with hunters at all tiers, but I'll grant that the druid will have to put in an order of magnitude more effort to make it work.
---
Nobody uses druid tank, that's a fact. They're just emergency offtank that sometimes people employ for ads because they can still do meh dps. Higher threat is a moot point because good tanks don't have threat problems, but druid tanks get destroyed because of mechanics like crushing blows

Discussions like this are relatively pointless, though. Yeah Superman could throw any of them in the sun, but if any Marvel character has Kryptonite then they can kill Superman, it's all situational and whoever wins can just be made up.

Well the ship was probably built by Van Cleef who was one of the guys who made Stormwind which is also an engineer's nightmare.

Back when there was an emotional connection with the game. Truly something special, and we are so privileged to soon be able to rediscover the great journey again.
---
Stoneform is legit great, but anyone that says racials *really* matter to an alliance hunter doesn't know what they are talking about.
---
The joke is that all the bad hunters roll elf.  Some dude the rolls dwarf is more likely to not be shit (ie he's got tranq and distract on his bar).

A ninja invite is when you don't whisper first, you just send the invite. In some online communities (ff11 I think?) that's actually frowned upon.
---
What OP is saying to do is to search and whisper, then invite based on response.

Just like he said they'd add flying to legion after a few weeks which ended up meaning after a year roughly.

Pull out game weak? Or you prefer the hot pocket?

He didn’t.
---
The items in naxx and aq are already astronomically better than BWL, making further raid content with better items would completely invalidate a lot of the older content, which is the same complaint about expansions.
---
I think they potentially could add a raid, but with sidegrades or items to support various itemizations / specs in ways they didn't in vanilla. These items would have to be diligently crafted to be relevant and useful but not straight up better than naxx. I think that would be hard to accomplish and easy to fuck up. So I don't think blizzard will take this route
---
&gt; You said that what I said was the equivalent of telling her to quit her job if I recommended she stop streaming.
---
If streaming is her job, yes, this seems as simple as 1+1=2. If X is your job, I tell you to stop X, I have told you to quit your job.
---
&gt;So please help me understand how this situation would be resolved if hypothetically she required streaming classic to make a living.
---
What is "this situation"? A person got ganked once. I am not sure what you think there is to "resolve".
---
&gt; Would you recommend the Oogas be banned
---
You keep repeating this. I feel like you really want someone to say that they should get banned from a PvP server for PvPing. Is that what you want someone to say?
---
&gt; This is a question, please try to answer it without devolving into a comment that says absolutely nothing.

Asking a stupid question and then complaining that you didn't get a stupid answer is no way to go through life, son.

Yep. You think that you did, but you didnt

---
Looking forward to classic so the hurt can go away.
---
Oh? Was the mmo mouse a little too much?
---
That’s some wile e coyote shit right there.
---
I have given part of this a lot of thought since the announcement of classic: the balancing.
---
I know it's popular to wave the #NoChanges banner, with a lot of streamers openly supporting it and gathering a following both passively and actively by continuing to praise the perfectly preserved vanilla game.
---
Personally, I would love to see a few buffs to the currently borderline unplayable specializations, such as Balance and Feral druids, Retribution paladins etc.
---
I'm not saying that everything needs to reach a level of perfect balance, but if every specialization is at least playable in both a levelling-, pvp- and raiding-environment, I personally believe that that will breathe a lot more life into the game. I'm fine with bottoming as DPS on my Enhancment shaman, but I would like to at least be raid viable beyond Nightfall.
---
Is this personal bias speaking? I would like to not think so. Maybe, but it's unlikely. What is likely, however, is that at least a part of the more hardcore #NoChanges crowd plan to abuse the lack of balance in the game to benefit themselves the most, and that is why they advocate for keeping the imbalance.
---
And all the quests and rep grinds and professions and exploring you only partially completed on the way to 60
---
Nah men now that you've started talking about that AV battle you have to make a separate post about it, you can't leave us hanging
---
Stop trying to squelch a legitimate concern.
---
¯\_(ツ)_///¯
---
Its gonna be okay friend
---
As someone who has a beta key I can confirm this. I planned on leveling to 40 this weekend only to find out all I can do is AV. I played two games and called it a night. I plan on playing a few more when I get off work just to try out a few more classes/specs, but playing AV all weekend wasnt my ideal weekend plans.
---
Be among the first wave of lvl 60, have a good reputation, get a network of friends.
---
Not sure where all the hate for this version of AV is coming from.
---
 It's not like retail AV at all in that you can not win through reenforcements and the objectives are still guarded by some fairly dangerous NPCs (on the AV test server even 5 58s with a healer and warrior are still having to kite the tower commanders around to kill them off). There's no mines and no korrak sure but the 2 games I played last night were an almost identical experience to the hundreds of AVs I played on nost/eylisium/LB. 
---
Ally turlted for an hour and 45 and held the horde at the bridge while 5-10 ppl that actually understood how to win AV spent that time slowly capping the towers and RH and convincing the rest of the team to go O. Once we had all the towers and RH capped we finally  got the whole team to ghost run down south and ended up winning at the 2 hour mark without the horde even capping DB east and west tower. 
---
Every AV Ive ever played on a private server either went the same as that with one team turtling and dragging it out or both teams zerged and it's over in 15-20 minutes. I don't understand what all the bitching is about...
---
Also on nost pretty much everyone that actually played semi seriously got exalted in 1-2 AV weekends so ppl bitching that it'll be so much faster with this version of AV also have no idea what they're talking about .
---
I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and think it's swell. Great job. I hope they consider this route rather than the rerelease of the xpacks.
---
Yeah but they steadily changed it even during Vanilla to try and get its length down.
---
It's what I'm going to do.  With the caveat of raiding one maybe two days a week with career minded adults who just want to drink and raid without the stress of being optimal or meta.  
---
The one part I can't figure out is how we deal with DKP with most of the raid being tipsy to drunk.  Maybe find us a good DD Master Looter.  Wake up the next morning wondering how BWL went.  Ohh?  An Ashkandi equipped?  Guess it went pretty good.
---
and wrist protector [https://i.imgur.com/sqs1DQh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sqs1DQh.jpg)
---
I don’t think that’s the point of this post. The fact is in vanilla for a certain period of time I was a dagger spec rogue. Not the “optimal” spec for PVE. I never had problem finding a spot in my guilds raid and I enjoyed PVP as a dagger rogue. I’m sure many of the top guilds of the time would have never let a dagger rogue tag along but many many guilds were more than happy to take me on a raid if they needed to fill a spot and needing a spot filled does occur more often then you would expect. Rogue isn’t even the best example for this. I’m sure there are plenty of others who had much worse class/spec combinations that didn’t have problem finding a successful raid group.
---
I believe that layering is much worse. Clustering means merges after a few weeks. A few pain points in an otherwise cohesive experience in which you see the same people. Very reminiscent of Vanilla. 
---
Layering is a lingering illness every day for the first few months, since it is sharding and comes with most of the issues that sharding comes with as well as some that we haven't yet seen.
---
&gt; Why are we having progressive itemization?
---
We don't. Items will be at the state as how they were in 1.12.1, even in Phase 1.
---
Got another rogue one for you that I really enjoyed back in the day. Killer soundtrack.

Is this meant to be reference to avengers? Cause I haven’t seen it yet ;|
---
You clearly don't know what you are talking about.  Good tanks don't have threat problems?  Raid dps is capped by threat.  There are warriors running furyprot make up the difference and they aren't concerned with being crit/crushed either.
---
Maybe do a little research and talk to people that have actually done vanilla raids recently before sharing your 'knowledge'.
---
This is what my guild is all about :) if youre on EU horde PM me!
---
I have read it. Nowhere does it educate me on what this individual who call himself TipsOut have done.

I am sure there is a place in Vietnam that looks like STV.
---
Tips stop deleting all your posts on your alt account, it makes the thread really annoying to read.
---
I really like these! This concept of areas that we'll never see, but that could be, is similar to Essos from GoT series: we'll never see or know more about the Winged Man City nor the Leviathan Sound (or the Hidden Sea), we can only imagine them.  
---
Your art gives me this same feeling: these areas could even exist but we have no access to them, we only hear tales from afar. You've made an impressive work, there is no way ppl would be sick of this.
---
Right when they're born is the best too, all mine did was sleep or eat for three months straight!
---
Even the class changes in TBC weren't that radical. I think the biggest impact TBC had was it allowed them to deprecate the existing gear and release gear that balanced for more specs. A lot of the issues with Vanilla balance were gear related.
---
What has that got to do with anything?
---
You must be rich now!
---
EU horde sign me up baby!
---
Lmao I thought the exact same. All the 15 year olds dropping N bombs, autism this, cancer that, all gone. Bunch of little shits.
---
He owned a company and submitted false invoices to several local California governments for work they were supposed to do but either never did or did so poorly it had to be redone.
---
When the government called them out on it and banned them, TipsOut called them racists and threatened to sue the board members individually in order to intimidate them into lifting the ban.
---
It went to court and it turns out TipsOut had been doing this A LOT and this judge finally shut him the hell up, forcing them to pay. His company (and him personally) was forced into bankruptcy and any company TipsOut works for is still banned from ever owning contracts from these governments.
---
He's a real piece of shit.
---
My son was one year old on launch.  Now since I main healers I am teaching him to tank for classic. We will be able to run dungeons any time we want to. LFM, have tank and heals. :D
---
Cool ideas. I also feel like +resist stats were one way to avoid the "+5 ilvl = upgrade" patch system we have now in retail. It also encourages gearing up your fellow raiders. A handful of bomb dps can't carry through Saph if everyone is getting smoked by frost splash damage.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Lol
---
Dude all it took was to be in a guild or in his discord
---
If you read it, you can see how fraudulent and terrible the company was. TipsOut OWNED the fucking company. No decision was made without his consent.
---
Or if the fight is longer than 7 seconds add another warlock instead
---
They did that in like Mists of Pandaria or something. #nochanges
---
Not going to sub 2 weeks early just for 3 names. I'll take my chances come release. I'm more interested in server names. Getting all my friends on the same server had always been a challenge...
---
One minute and no, another warlock isn’t a better choice.
---
You can still upgrade troops and summon bosses in the 1.12.1 version of AV.
---
Undead, duh
---
We will be creating the characters to reserve names, but we will be unable to log into the game.
---
The people that really care about stuff like this, is the same people that ruined retail.
---
I would absolutely love more pvp attack points (such as towers in EPL) but in Hillsbrad and other more populated places that really put weight on the Wpvp dynamic.
---
IDK How I feel about leeway. I kind of like it because it means lag is way less of a factor.
---
No, we just know it's not enough and demand more.
---
They stopped in WoD because that's when the subscription numbers started actually dropping, it was also the lowest they ever been since 2005 or 2006, so you can understand why they decided to stop reporting subs. To answer your question my guess is Data census that may give you an estimate of how many active players there are on each server.
---
What part of his attitude is elitist?
---
DM is either depending on context. LFG DM in Westfall? Deadmines. 
---
Talking about best farming class? Dire Maul.
---
&gt;enh shaman
---
Hm? They don't bring anything that a Resto can't, other than a very slight increase in strength to the str/windfury totems.
---
Not quite. Flash stomps literally everyone here combined.
---
Yeah if you overgeared the content you'd have threat issues, and at that point you'd need fury prot for threat.
---
druid tanks are pure suicide on progression raids. You'd absolutely die on harder hitting bosses or phrases, at least fury prot can swap on phrase change.
---
Ok that's bad. I don't like when people act like that.
---
So how is this relevant for Classic wow and his streaming and duel tournament? In your opinion, when should he be allowed to start a new career?
---
Except for warriors
---
Sorry dude but this is the wrong zone. The original was taken just north of the Icemane troll bridge in Dun Morogh. The recreation was done in Winterspring.
---
When you receive a message like that, you have done a good job playing the game. Be proud.
---
Mate we tried to min/max back in the day as well. It’s just that we had no idea how to.
---
People *do care* how fast you press frostbolts. I don’t know what OP smoked. Back in the day, guilds were very meters centric and you could bet there were a bunch of rogues and other classes competing for highest raid dps. Big yellow numbers and bragging rights are part of why many players enjoyed the game.
---
So, the same as always for countless years?
---
The flace is fleel
---
why do something if you arent going to try your best though? raiding is a team activity, by having a scuffed spec or not showing up youre letting the team down. its basic respect. I agree, any class can join a raid team but for realsies if you level a paladin expect to not even be in combat and just spend the night buffing and rezzing everyone.
---
Dagger rogue can be very competitive with good gear
---
DMF buff is a random 1-10% damage increase. The Mage on the private server video could have been unlucky and only had a 1-3% increase, where as the Mage in the Rag video could have had a 8-10%. The math also works out for this theory.
---
Sadly, 1.12 AV and original AV are very different things. 
---
There’s also just a different mindset. I don’t think we’ll ever recapture the magic of old AV, because people are too focused on optimization and not on just being stupid and fighting everywhere. 
---
I’d personally love for a reason to actually fight in the field of strife.
---
&gt; DD Master Looter
---
Haha, that's hilarious.
---
Yeah, hopefully there will be a decent amount of sane guilds. I think Vanilla's requirement for 40 people will be a reality check for many guild masters when they realize what is good enough.
---
I remember things being exactly the same back then too. The only difference is the community knows what they're talking about much more, whereas in vanilla it was a lot more guessing and hearsay.
---
The rule remains the same: ignore the elitists and play however's most fun for you, until it's raid time and people start inspecting.
---
this, i've been to sudbury many times as it's near a lot of national parks. It actually looks really nice, with a lot of trees everywhere. i would imagine he was inspired by visiting the site of an open pit mine somewhere around there.

Dont forget that Marvel also has weapons. DC is using their fists.

Join guild, pull your weight and make friends so they want to play with you
---
Lets meet halfway, nothing is too little and everything leaves nothing to the imagination
---
lol doing just fine now
---
My only criticism as well.  I very much love the ideas of Patch 1.14, 1.15 and 1.19 though!
---
It's not nuanced. Your title is beyond obvious and points 1-5 are redundant and common knowledge.   
---
You're addressing a non-problem with no solutions.
---
&gt; But how is this relevant for Classic wow and his streaming and duel tournament?
---
He makes money off his stream and hosting the duel tournament. He even stopped the tournament mid-duel to run ads, forcing the players to restart.
---
&gt;In your opinion, when should he be allowed to start a new career?
---
He already has. But he will never be allowed to hide from his past.
---
If people know the truth, they can decide to support him or not. But if you do support him, you're giving money and advertising revenue to someone this terrible. Most people would not do that.
---
It also matters when your accounts where made.
---
I searched zone by zone within the level group I needed and then filtered by class... this is better though haha
---
No one gives a shit about preraid BiS for UBRS. If you show up to MC expecting loot when you're wearing a ton of greens tho.... you're out of touch with reality
---
Francis?
---
Priest specials aside, WOTF is way better than Troll’s slight haste increase. Always a tough choice for priest on horde side. Not as clear cut as dwarf on alliance.
---
You've already roasted yourself! FTH! :D
---
Think I'll leave it a week, see where all the streamers fall and avoid.
---
I'll watch some content compilations for the craic but I don't want to live with 400 people following streamers around.
---
Ok ok, he was a douche in his past. Bad man.
---
So what now? For how long will you continue this crusade? Are you doing it for your pleasure or your concern about his viewers?
---
Yeah sounds like we are certainly in the same boat. Personally I probably will end up going Horde though as long as my friends still end up playing and preferring it.
---
And look at it this way - if you haven't played Horde as much (if at all) it'll be a fresher experience that way too. Play races you haven't played and experience quests and zones from the other side and all. In my case it means avoiding playing yet another human after having three 80 human characters back in WoTLK...
---
So you removed the watermark advertising your website, but are still posting from the same account? Why.
---
I think a lot of people are hyped for the old style BGs and getting ranks tho. I would agree that RBGs could be fun but they don’t have RBGs for AV in retail do they?
---
I think your last point is the most accurate.  Anyone advocating for #NoChange is either banking on the imbalance to benefit themselves or they don't plan on playing the game for very long.  They'll get their nostalgia fix and then go on to the next game that tickles their fancy.  Not saying that's a wrong viewpoint but it is a somewhat short-sighted outlook on a game that could give us another decade of enjoyment.  
---
I'm in agreement with you on the not every class should be even and topping damage but they should find a way to make ostracised classes valuable in raiding and pvp environments.  Give classes like the enh and ele shaman specific buff or debuff totems.  Give ret pallys a cd that increases the attack speed of everyone in their party.  Give feral druids better threat mechanics so that not only Warriors can MT.  
---
Most of my ideas are just spitballing but I think they could manage to figure out some way to make things more inclusive.  I do however think that the original patches and waves should stay the same and the changes I'm proposing shouldn't happen till after the Naxx wave.
---
AV has litterally always been like this, except when nobody had any clue how to play av and just fought 40v40 in the middle.
---
My first multiplayer game didn’t have physical threats or rampant racism. Matter of fact neither did my 2nd or 3rd mmo. This is particularly unique to pservers. Didn’t fly in UO (which is crazy considering everything that went on in UO), didn’t fly in EQ, or WoW at release.
---
School: Dropped out of.
---
I get what you were saying. I think I'm not getting my original point across, so I'll just digress
---
Wotf clears fear charm sleep.
---
Interesting perspective
---
Thats vanilla tho it's all about the grind.
---
He's still a douche. He maintains his company did nothing wrong, has never apologized, and still claims all these individuals from multiple separate governments are all racists and were just out to get him.
---
I will inform people of TipsOut's true nature every time I see his name brought up. Well, pretty soon a bot will, now that I found some source code I can modify.
---
Being an Orc or a human warrior means that your 6% hit chance is as good as 9% hit chance (and much more). To say people who want that “are trying hard to be optimal” is very misleading.
---
If you want to cut off your left hand, go for it. But don’t go bashing people that make informed decisions. Free 3% hit is huge for warriors.
---
No DMF sayge buff (1-10% increased damage).
---
It did when wow first came out, nobody knew how to play av really and just 40 v 40 in the middle until resources ran out.
---
Well, thanks for your input. You've been a real pleasure to talk to.
---
I don’t think classics draw was ever really the complexity or the difficulty. It was in essence the community building and friends you made along the way.
---
OG Blizzard really did a great job crafting a world where you have to interact with other players at pretty much all levels of the game to get things done. (Depending on class ofc)
---
-Learn your rotation while keeping enough energy for a kick. 
---
-Resist gear
---
-300 lockpicking + seal of ascension and boss summon items for easy networking and group invites
---
-be reliable. So if you sign up for a raid. BE THERE or at least inform the raid lead if you can't make it. Also focus on the raid while you're playing.
---
Wtf can priest do anyways? I'm maining one come classic and I'm worried about having a steady income. Expecting to have to get a 60 hunter alt for farming.
---
The healer that contributes the most dps is either a paladin or a shaman. Their buffs add the most over all Totems for the melee and the tranquil air for all dps allowing them to worry less about threat is massive. And then paladins with their blessings are just over powered.
---
Blizzard tried to balance classes all throughout vanilla. The issue is that the designers themselves weren't entirely sure where hybrids would fit into the overall game mechanics. 
---
Jeff kaplan specifically wanted hybrids to fill healer slots, as evidenced by the tier sets. The general idea being that non-healing specs were reserved for farming/dungeons. 
---
Eventually blizzard attempted to move the needle a bit but a large concern was to not make the hybrids stronger than their "pure" counterparts. I.e. why bring a rogue if a feral druid can heal and do solid dps? Because of this hybrids stayed underpowered in non healing specs. Also, raids needed healers, so it was a dirty job that someone had to do.
---
It wasn't until TBC that blizzard finally learned that they could have their cake and eat it too with talent and itemization revamps. This is the expansion where you truly could fill a specialized role without having scores of players cry foul. I think a big part of this was due to raids only requiring 25 players. There was a lot less need for "pure" classes to carry the load for everyone else.
---
Druids specifically were nerfed in tanking in early TBC because the itemization and class design made druids much stronger early game, but falling off mid-late tier. My friend damn near quit the game because my well geared druid would beat his aq40 hand of rag warrior in duels.
---
Class identity was very strong in vanilla and hybrids being anything other than healers was heavily frowned upon by some people.
---
Jesus Christ
---
Hunter rotation is 1000X more interesting than mage or warlock rotations.
---
From what I've tested the performance is much better than you see on a private server. But it doesn't have multicore enabled like the BfA client does.
---
So sadly a bit of a performance drop compared to BfA. But still fantastic performance. 
---
Specs: Threadripper 2950x, Radeon VII, 64GB RAM. Running at 1440p and I have FPS locked at 150. On private servers I can only get like 80 FPS. 
---
Should be good to run on almost anything if you lower graphic settings as needed.
---
Just be specific.  I'm probably not going to be downloading anything today champ.  That's how PC's get raped lol.  All I am saying is that the bar for being a racist has been lowered to "X person wore a MAGA hat.  Clearly racist"
---
I can't wait to enjoy Classic TBC.
---
From someone who has only played until WotLK I love your take on some of the unfinished areas in Azeroth! Those blank zones always held so much mystery. I remember exploring the eastern Wetlands (Grim Batol?) and being disappointed after killing all the elite dragons there and finding just a dead end.
---
Our raid leader was a pretty stern guy with a deep voice. Found out like 6 months in that he was 14. Blew my mind.
---
Good players in shitter guilds typically got poached by better guilds in my experience during vanilla. A guild full of non try hards will never see past vael because their carry players will get frustrated and leave.
---
To be fair, she does come across as a thot. How do you say it? If it looks like a thot and quacks like a thot...it's probably a thot?
---
Dagger is completely viable in PvE even from a min/max perspective. People saying that it is swords or bust are oversimplifying things.
---
One undeniable fact: It’s better to use great dagger drops since you have a limited amount of good swords.
---
I know many exceptional rogues that prefer daggers most of the time. There is a trade off and it is not as cut and dry as many would believe.
---
It's definitely cheating.  It's also definitely harrassment if you're going out of your way to hunt them down.
---
I've already made it clear I don't care about normal PVP interactions. But if you turn on someone's stream to try and find them and ruin their experience, you're just harassing them and they are the victim in that case. Guilds that are founded around streamsniping and camping streamers should probably be banned by blizz.
---
It's a shame the same unions are infested with greed and fuck over people just like a big company.  Your literally trading one evil for another, don't sugar coat it.  I left the unions and work independently now and make 3x as much with better health insurance.  
---
Unions are designed as a pyramid scheme just like the corporations they supposedly shield workers from.  It always feels like the only workers they protect are the ones who don't deserve the job in the first place, other than that it's basically adding taxes to every paycheck to get someone else rich.
---
It's all a sham anyways.  The only way up is your own drive and choices.  You don't get rich or live well being a worker bee.
---
God. Not inside her!?
---
You have now informed me about this persons past. I think what he have done is very bad.
---
With that said. And this is my honest opinion. I think that they way you are acting here is worse than what he did. Your behaviour is a bit scary to be honest. You are so fixated with this streamer and I don't think it's healthy.
---
&gt; a couple times
---
Try every fucking 5 minutes.
---
Already getting WLB tattooed on my skinny fat stomach
---
Yeah WOTF is awesome and it's a hard choice. I have gone back and forth a dozen times. Ultimately I think I made my decision based on the current class polls. It looks like warrior/rogue/mage are going to be the most played classes. And shadowguard will.he better against those classes than WOTF. I dont plan to pve much so I'm only really thinking about pvp right now. 
---
Does the haste work with channeled spells like mind flay? If not then it does seem kind of useless unless I drop shadow to heal for an emergency
---
This is nice. Good job &lt;3
---
What's good and what's bad is entirely subjective here though.

They had ganked her multiple times to the point where she could not play the game, I thought you knew this as it was talked of in this thread but that is my mistake. Furthermore, I meant that she did not need to stream classic not in general.
---
From California, can confirm 200-300ft trees. They are not purple though, unfortunately :(
---
The speed of most of these runs comes from micro. Thats what  saves a ton of time in conjunction. the route is quite self explanatory imo.
---
few tips: 
---
you need to kill the mobs of your level, for instance as level one prioritize killing level 1 mobs. Once you dinged level priotize level 2 and so on. Its much more effective.
---
Also you need to chain pull and move to the next mob while fighting the previous and actively track and abuse ding hp regen. so tack your xp bar at these early levels, and when you gonna ding.
---
for melees body/wepon pull next mob before you finished the previous one, and loot the body between the autottacks.
---
for casters if there are multiple mobs at one place, kill multiple mobs then loot them together, it saves time and works with 5 second rule regen.
---
And for mana classes abuse 5 seconds regen, look at ticks and use abilities intact with a tick. Basically so cast happen right after the tick, etc.
---
Mom says I'm special too!

shamans have windfury totem which will make melee dps cream their pants for you

You’re so ugly you make Gnomes seem somewhat decent in comparison

The annoying thing about this one is that you get like 4 people that want to go, and since you've spammed the fuck out of everyone, you're likely not going to reply to them all, so you've just now bothered a bunch of people and then ghosted them.
---
The way to do this is to give everyone you talk to at least the perception that you're talking specifically to them. If you ever show something like "LF healer last spot for Strat" to someone in purple text, you're going to get ignored by everyone hella fast. 
---
So, this can very much work, but you gotta be willing to reply, even if someone says "no thanks", and you pretty much have to give people 10-20 seconds to reply if they don't do so immediately before you move on to talking to the next person.
---
I always love using thunderbluff as my main hearthstone when i level my tauren. The atmosphere is so peaceful and majestic.  Nice and calm and all the cool tipis and tauren chilling out probably just 4/20 blazing all day.
---
Thats why i roll tauren there the master race peace pipe smokers. Female tauren +10
---
;)
---
That would have made it even funnier? :D
---
It does so at first but if you actually read it, it is clearly trying to bash people that encourage making optimal decisions as “try hards”.
---
Picking a race that gets free 3% hit rate is not being a “try hard”.
---
It’s more of a “you’re racial choices are insignificant because this game is so easy and my way of picking what looks best is better”.
---
LOL, you think making sure people know about someone's massive fraudulent behavior and lack of any remorse or apology is somehow worse than the massive fraudulent behavior?

haha :P

They do, Random Epic Battlegrounds can be AV.
---
1. Paladins do this quite well, a healingpriest can spec into shadowweaving to get warlocks going(instead of using a shadowpriest), but I think you will really enjoy shaman for this. Their totems are amazing for melee dps, they will love having you.
---
2. Shamans do pretty well in pvp without being elemental spec, disc priests which is also a raiding spec do quite well in pvp too. 
---
3. You really won't need to quest at all once you hit 60, and all the healer classes you should level as one of their dps specs. But again for just killing mobs in the world for whatever reason I would recommend priest and shaman. 
---
Sounds like shaman is the class for you?
---
Not really a competition if people don't even know they need to enter the race :)
---
if you think threats and racism is unique to world of warcraft private servers then I don't know what to tell you
---
Not necessary. You still get the results without it unless there are 50 people from a guild names “Ironforge Warriors”
---
just like real life
---
I'm assuming they'll be announcing the server names at some point before this, so that people can coordinate and pick servers to play on together.
---
That said, it's like any fresh launch; you just gotta get lucky and hope your server doesn't suck.
---
Agreed. Tauren are the hippys of the bunch. Hands down thats why i play them.
---
I’m in the beta and I played one AV before I was ready to do something else.
---
AV is ok, to some extent. But being popped into a new character you have no actual investment in and being tasked to grind one BG all weekend is kinda just not gonna work. I got bored and played some Mordhau and Apex, and I feel bad because I know so many people would love to just try it for a bit but they haven’t been invited.
---
They should have done it like a stress test and left the beta server open or opened after a set amount of time. I’m down to AV, when it’s my character and the rep I grind works.
---
I tried finding bugs and stuff but didn’t really find anything worth reporting in an entire two hour game. That said I haven’t grinded AV since 2005 or so, so I’m not sure what to look for beyond my own character, and I had most of my warlock bugs reported in the regular beta.
---
The irony is that if you get 40 people with the attitude of "just show up" without the proper consumes, enchants, pre raid bis, specs, class distributions etc you end up with a guild where no one gives a shit about trying to improve their raid performance in the slightest. That guild will struggle in bwl, have massive player dropoff, any half decent players that dont quit the game will eventually join a better guild when they realize they actually do want to put in the extra effort !o progress. Where you get rewarded based on your efforts. Not, youve got a pulse so heres your handout of loot since no ones accountable to anount to anything besides existing. Classic is easier than retail of course but its not LFR easy. Extremely casual guilds are in for a rude awakening.
---
Yeah this is how I've always formed all of my groups on vanilla private servers. Using public channels is mostly a waste of time, will result in having people compete for loot, and bad players.
---
Whispering allows you to build a good group composition with mixed classes that aren't as likely to need the same loot.
---
I can tell you why I am not talking about.
---
Mounts, for me, fall in the same category as pets. They are as irrelevant in an MMO as the color of the mail boxes.
---
I really don't care about mounts in MMOs. They have A SINGLE purpose : movement.

Any kind of mount will do for me.

Gold farming and BoE blue gear here I come!
---
oh shit i never even considered the effect of classic wows release on take out orders. I bet you could do a study on it and get decent results
---
Thanks!  Seems very well written and though out. I see you also got downvoted to hell, lol. Thats how this subreddit goes sometimes.
---
As I said. Probably not the best example. But it is definitely not “optimal” I should also add I was a NE rogue which is also not “optimal” in a perfect world in the most elite guilds I would have been a human sword spec. Also the burst damage of daggers can be problematic if not controlled properly. I’m currently in a mental battle of optimal vs nostalgia. I’m leaning towards going optimal with either human (pve), dwarf (pvp) or orc (dominant but also horde)
---
I was just kidding, I understand.
---
Are you?

Yo bro your cake seems to be out of mana

This is like complaining about imperfections on a 2 karat diamond that you got for free.

Okay specifically he and his best friends constantly call people the n word among like ten thousand other things

i really think they should only go for a week or two, if they insist on doing it. 6-8 is too long
---
Ah, I haven’t played since 2014 so I don’t really know very much so thanks!
---
Nope. 1.12 has fewer NPCs, massively nerfed NPC damage, no mines, no troll boss
---
These guys starting to get annoying.
---
&gt;These AV last about 30-90 minutes. 
---
A single AV used to last hours and days.
---
&gt;because of the terrible queue times due to pop-shrinkage at the end of Vanilla. 
---
the pop increased rapidly all throughout vanilla though, there was never a point during vanillas lifespan where the pop was not increasing. 
---
&gt;Merging is a permanent irreversible destructive process. It's literally the worst solution for realm pop issues.
---
the way they've planned layering is very similar to merges. You'll be placed in semi-permanent layers for a few months until phase 2, and then they will all be merged together into a single server. I don't see how it'd be massively different to just have a pre planned "merge group" of say, 3 servers, where names etc are reserved across them and then they'll merge those when pops drop.
---
I agree. I think one of the issues with daggers is the burst damage that can pull aggro. I was consistently top 3 in DPS for my guild but had to be careful not to pull aggro and wipe the group. Especially coming out of stealth with huge crits.
---
I liked the idea of totems and being a melee spellcaster. I really wanted it to work in PvP, but I never won any duels. The whole idea of the class suits me as a person perfectly and I have great respect for Thrall. I just wish I could find a proper enhancement PvP guide...
---
&gt;he implies, whether intentionally or mistakenly, that we are therefore not qualified to analyze systems in the game
---
This isn’t what he’s saying at all. He’s saying we criticize without a full understanding of the decision making process, which is true. We’ll never have the full set of information or the full context of a decision.
---
That being said, nothing there implies we can’t be critical. In fact the exercise of making a coherent, constructive criticism, while acknowledging known unknowns will make your criticism more effective.
---
Since he now deleted all of them, his name was /u/hoofootwow.
---
People like this making up more and more of the classic community really scares me. It feels like there is only a matter of time until they become loud enough to make classic a bfa server with a lower level cap.
---
These guys are starting to get annoying af.
---
You can learn a lot from games that you can apply to real life. But it depends greatly on the person because if they for example struggle mentally it can just make things so much worse for them.
---
I'd say shaman if horde, paladin if alliance
---
Only if you stop taking them
---
If it wasn't included in the regular sub, then no, but since we will have a million of BFA players who will make classic chars to try it out and then stop playing before lvl 20 because it takes too long, there will be a huge population problem that layering seems like the best solution to.
---
1.	Shamans followed by exceptional priests. Or Paladins with a Nightfall.
---
2.	Shamans hand down. Or exceptional priests with insane gear.
---
3.	Druids are quite efficient. Priests can be efficient too. Paladins are steady and not in-efficient. Shamans lose hands down but at least they get ghost form.
---
Honestly the streams are killing the hype for me and I've played on most Pservers while waiting for classic launch
---
That giant is tired of our shit
---
If I could give you both my beta accounts I would. We don't play it at all now, just bored with it. Wife especially wasn't into it after just a couple days.
---
Do you honestly think we think that skill isn't important!?
---
&gt; Merging is a permanent irreversible destructive process. It's literally the worst solution for realm pop issues.
---
How merging was done would be the worst solution. However if merging was done differently it could be an entirely valid method for solving the problem. Instead of simply combining random low pop servers a much better option would be on release create say Tichodrius 1-5 with players being made aware that as the server population shrinks the numbered servers will be combined to compensate for the loss of players. As long as people are well aware how it's going to work and that their server is part of a larger group even if they start disconnected from it it doesn't have to be the shit show that was merging historically.
---
I’m sure he’s human, and just orcs out when he’s angry
---
You sure you don’t want to tank this SM Arm? No one needs the axe...
---
Great info, thank you! 
---
Its probably an old topic, but clearly I missed it...Classic doesnt have Multicore? Why?
---
Ahhhh the Collectors Addition
---
I've already subbed to WoW even though Classic isn't out yet, and I don't much at all play the current iteration of WoW.
---
The edge is strong with this one
---
I looked up some SS's showing a tiny SS's of someones discord.  What was Stay Safes names on these because I don't see "StaySafe" anywhere.
---
Doesn't seem bad, and I planned on doing the same. I kinda want to Raid, but we'll see how that goes. Not healing for a year to get Shadow gear, so if that's not a possibility I'll just PvP.
---
I would love to hang out with TipsOut knowing what I know now but you scares me.
---
What do you mean? Then you can finally play the game. Don't forget to add eyes of the beast to your hotbar.
---
Nah feral can dps and tank actually very well and compete on nearly all encounters with top parsing specs and warrior tanks. Just need to farm gnomergan and go above and beyond with gesr consumes enchants etc. This is old thinking for druid new info has come out.
---
For the shaman yeah if your in any sort of serious raiding guild your gonna be healing. Thats why im going 30/0/21 and gonna heal until we hit a progression wall and switch to mana tide
---
Why did you sub? Did you know you don't need active sub to get into beta?
---
Probably for the best though, no? Rather have the streamer have their own name than someone potentially impersonate and abuse the name.
---
Pretty sure RBG stands for rated battle ground.
---
Watch current druid tanking videos. Youll see new information has come out bri
---
Oof, my bad. I thought he meant Random Battle Ground.
---
As a kid I used to love those ‘horrible histories’ books, Greek mythology and Native America were and still are my favourites.. I remember loading up the character creation screen and realising I could play as a bloody Minotaur. I was so happy!
---
Coming back as an adult I realise I relate with everything you just said, and that’s why I still love them. 
---
“Strength and 
---
*fat bong rip, exhales slowly*
---
honour bro”
---
Ah, so that's what this has all been about, you're defending him because you "would love to hang out with TipsOut". Want him to mention you on stream, is that it?
---
&gt; Almost none of the people who are mad about this have even logged in yet.
---
You don't need to have been able to play yet to clearly see how layering is going to impact the economy in a way that was not possible in vanilla. Layering fundamentally changes the scarcity of resources and it is never going to provide a 1-1 ratio between the increase in resources and the amount consumed. It will inevitably radically impact the in game economy relative to a fixed availability of resources.
---
Bro
---
Classic is meant to be classic, nothing more and nothing less. If you alter classic it might as well be a different game. Too many developers are making games so fast and tweaking them to the point where it is ruining franchises. Wow is already in a bad place with BFA so we wanted some change and we got it. Give classic time before wanting more. BC was fun but classic is meant to be enjoyed over a long period of time. Overnight changes would ruin its original purpose
---
With layering, if there's a bigger boom on launch than expected...there's no reason to open new servers. 
---
But I think you're right. Classic will be busy the first few weeks but no way will the population just keep climbing after that point. I predict a sharp drop-off after 3-4 weeks.
---
Fuck this sub has gotten toxic who are you the comment police rofl
---
Hahahaha yup 100%
---
They consistently lied about phasing, even leaving it enabled on RP realms where they promised it wouldn't be used.
---
Yeah. But that’s what Soda suggested.
---
I think TBC and wrath fans deserves to have their favorite expansion recreated and it would be egoistic to ask for additional vanilla content instead of expanding to TBC.
---
Attendance and DPS
---
Bring consumables and don't semi afk at trash mobs (also use CDs)
---
So that's where I gotta go to find dinosaurs.
---
Yes, someone showed me that during either BC or WotLK, I forget which year it was
---
Most curent biggest servers definitely ban for some of that if the player is hateful enough and gets reported
---
I remember that "leak". It's aggressively unsubstantiated and based of of bad data that almost no one got to see, right around the time the "Fuck BfA" train started rolling, that also could not have included China. Assuming it was true something slightly north of 50% of users had to be using a specific add-on.
---
In short it was essentially a rumor where some guy said "I saw this thing that's secret that says all your biases are true". Perfect fucking storm for an internet circlejerk.
---
There are many fights where aggro is not an issue (like Loatheb). And what you say is why playing melee dps makes so much more fun next to an exceptional tank that can out-threat you.
---
If you are approaching in stealth than the tank should by all means have a big head start and enough threat even if you lead with Ambush backstab in the span of one gcd.
---
No no, I am not subbed to TipsOut and I dont follow him on Twitch. I have never watched one of his streams. I have watched some videos and clips, but I'm not really a fan.
---
This is about you though and your behaviour.
---
I think the Tipsout seems like a funny guy and knowing what I know now, I honestly don't care. Your behaviour on the other hand is scary.
---
... that’s exactly how fire played in WotLK lol. Use LB off cd and spam fireball until you get hot streaks lol.
---
Acting as if there aren't legitimate criticisms of the issues with layering presented in a thoughtful manner is just nonsense. Sure there's always some idiots who will complain in a unconstructive fashion but pointing at those and saying that's the criticism of layering is exactly what the person you're responding to is talking about when people and blizzard pick the worst criticisms as if they're exemplar of all the criticisms rather than addressing the reasoned and thoughtful ones.
---
Wow classic featuring unreal engine
---
it's easy to find a raiding guild and gearing up for warlocks even though 3-4 warlocks will be taken max per raid in any semi-hardcore guild, mainly for your curses. 
---
What I didn't like about playing the class is that other dps classes are prioritized over you if those 3-4 spots are filled up, especially mages. They just have a lot more damage and a lot less threat issues. Also you won't be able to roll on any mage items while they can roll for your +hit items like neltharions tear just as much as you can. 
---
Despite all that, gearing up is very easy, you gear up so fast that you will only sign up for raids to help your guildies. You can also just run 1 spec for raiding/pvp throughout the entire game that is very convenient.
---
You think people deserving to know the truth is scary?
---
Agreed that when things go poorly is when people start getting annoyed but mostly this will be based on damage and healing meters instead of purely spec. As long as you can still put up the numbers you’ll be fine. Focus on spending mana wisely and not over healing and you should be fine. Paladins have the advantage of spamming rank 1 heals for basically forever to inflate the numbers without going over. Ymmv.
---
They'll be fine for offtanks, but be prepared to spend an incredible amount of time to gear when any other prot warrior could've been just as good.
---
And many hard hitting bosses would be out of questions unless your guild like the increase challenge.
---
So nice to hear from you! The name definitely sounds extremely familiar, (although its been a good 13 or so years so forgive me for not being sure) hope all is well. 
---
The Dethecus wow forums were unrelenting. If you made so much as the smallest boast or brag and couldnt back it up, you would be eviscerated non-stop. The best thing about being a Druid is that no one ever expected you to really get into the fray, as they wouldn't expect you to be a PvP assassin. But if you were a Rogue, Mage, or Warrior that talked junk and couldnt back it up, you would regret it until the end of your days.
---
Good times.
---
This attitude only works for mc.
---
Gnomes are beautiful
---
Yeah if you can find a raid of 40 competent raiders who know the mechanics and their class inside and out. Then honestly i dont even see the problem with meme specs being brought. This content is going to be beaten Mc within the first week or two and then everything going forward on the first day that it releases.
---
The problem here is this. Say your in a guild and progressing on MC you guys get stuck on say majordomo and you seem to be hitting a wall. The THE FIRST PLACE the raid is going to look is over at the meme specs. Anything that could possibly be holding them back. Even if it isnt entirely their fault. Just knowing that you have suboptimal specs while your stuck on progression will be an issue.
---
The prior NPC version before they were nerfed couldn't be served as quickly. Even a few defenders made a larger impact than what it is now.
---
No it is from Freak Show or some old black and white carnival movie where the little people keep chanting this phrase over and over
---
Well if there is, it can't be found here. If criticism would be even remotely sophisticated there wouldn't be need to moderate most of these "legit criticism" posts.
---
What about cata fans ;P
---
Ultimate Flag Runner for WSG?
---
Blizzard should take notes. There is an abundance of content possibilities available for post-Classic content. Although I'm a huge fan of TBC, which is when I started playing WoW, I think continuing the fundamentals of Classic would be great. 
---
Anyway, my opinion aside, this is fantastic work! Keep it up!
---
Yea man, you can't see it so it's not real.  Not that WoW gold was once worth more than most other country's actual currency.  Not that WoW is currently the most populated MMO and has been for quite some time.  Not that the currency market has been huge, huge since around 2005.  
---
Here is a little secret, almost all farming bots do solo instance runs of obscure dungeons so people don't actually see the characters to report them.  This is a business for them and has been for 13 years, you really think they won't do everything they can to make their characters last longer.

I remember rubber banding in Guild Wars. Eugh

Man, whatever mental hoops you want to jump through to justify liking him are fine.
---
**I really enjoyed reading through these.** There are some ideas I'm 100% for, and some I think would be a little lackluster. I still want to say that I appreciate the effort you put into these ideas. That being said, let me rattle off some things I would be excited about, and the negatives, \*as though these were real patches coming to Classic.\*
---
1.14- I think a scarlet raid is really exciting. Theres some rich backstory that could prop up a raid pretty well. However, I don't like the idea of going to areas that are existing in the current game, such as Uldum, 10-man Karazhan, or also Avalon. It would be a different experience, sure, but I've seen that place before. If Blizzard were to run the risk of adding new content to Classic, it should be *new* content, or it kind of defeats the purpose. I think there are other options for a Scarlet raid, that wouldn't feel like the area was rehashed. I wonder how they would make a raid out of mostly humanoid mobs. Also, perhaps the first raid to come out should be more casual friendly. BWL isn't elite, per se, but maybe the first raid should be along the lines of ZG? Even giving out blues on some bosses, so as to keep the BiS for most hardcore raiders unchanged for the most part.
---
1.15- *Nothing* negative to say about this patch. Cool battleground, quests breathing life into a mostly unused zone, and most of all, an extra 5-man. I would LOVE to see a BRD style 5-man in Azshara's unused Timbermaw gate for levels 55-60. Perhaps a furlbog inspired mini-city with an easier section for 55s and a harder section for level 60 groups, or more daring lowbies. As far as questing goes, though, I hope they wouldn't go too far, and turn Azshara into a busy place. I like that it's kind of a quiet haven of eternal fall, without much disturbance around. So maybe a questline or two, 10 quests max, would be a nice addition to this zone.
---
1.16- I think most of this patch could be done without. I'm torn on whether or not adding Hyjal would be a good thing. We've already been to Hyjal *twice* in WoW. I don't know how excited I would be to see a *third* version of the same place. I do like how you kind of tied in the Cataclysm lore, so that this is kind of a prequel, but I also don't like that we're kind of forced to use Cata lore/design as an anchor for developing a classic Hyjal. Plus, a 10-man AND a raid is kind of overkill for one patch, especially when we want to *really draw out* the Classic + experience, so as to not *overclutter the game*. Also, I think there are other options for an instance that could feel less awkward than a firelands raid, or an outdoor event, as you suggest. There isn't much in the way of demonic instances in Classic, so theres plenty of room for a culmination of that theme in a Hyjal instance. Perhaps one of the fortresses is instanced off, and you have to fight through numerous buildings, and underground lairs. I think one single 10-man and nothing else would be ideal. UBRS is fun, and Classic could certainly use another 10-man dungeon. Perhaps somewhere along the lines of UBRS gear, where there are some shitty pieces, but some pieces that you could use even into BWL. It would be pretty awful if you could repeatedly farm a 10-man for gear better than MC, right?
---
1.17- FUCK. YES. I would love a Dragon Isles patch, and wanted one ever since the John Staats interviews. Again, though, 2 raids in 1 patch is too many. I'd prefer to see the additions to Classic as slim *supplemental* content, rather than the original content being wiped out by a tsunami of new raids. Also, I think they have to be very careful with gear levels. Anything post Naxx is really dangerous for the game, even if you only boost stats by a tiny amount. Personally, I think the highest ever raid in Classic + shouldn't exceed Naxx. I would like it if the stats were 2-4% lower than Naxx, and maybe a couple pieces would be BiS including Naxx, but not most. The raid though sounds epic. I love the design of it, even in its unfinished state. An in between AQ40-Naxx raid, with 7-10 bosses, and an awesome setup sounds great.
---
1.18- They could absolutely find something for these areas. Perhaps small little side quests, nothing too major or gamechanging.
---
1.19 -I'm kind of 50/50 on the Highlands, just like with Hyjal. It would be different, but also kind of the same. I would hate to feel like I've been here before, when it's new content. Same with Grim Batol, although theres an easy workaround there. Just have us enter it on a different floor perhaps, where a layout is different. Also, the aesthetic would be more dwarven, rather than the purple/orange twilight aesthetic of Cata. A small 20-man would be pretty awesome here, perhaps BWL level.
---
1.20- Awesome. They could use Kara crypts, but also, there are unused designs of Karazhan that are entirely different from BC 10man Kara. Whether they use the crypts, old Kara, or both, that would be a home run. Even if it's just the crypts, that could be a fun 20 man raid, perhaps the hardest 20-man raid of Vanilla, at AQ40 difficulty. 
---
1.21 and onward- I'm not too interested in these ideas. I think they just add to the game where there isn't a need to add. Plus, most of that content is content *that weve already seen and explored*. The game might be getting a little bit bloated by 1.20, and they have to stop adding to Azeroth *at some point*. I think many of the ideas you brought would be excellent additions to Classic+, though I'm not big on pushing real Vanilla content aside with Cataclysm maps and content, even if it's reskinned and redesigned.
---
**Again, thanks for making this post, and I appreciate the work you put in.**
---
&gt; "just show up" without the proper consumes, enchants, pre raid bis, specs, class distributions etc you end up with a guild where no one gives a shit about trying to improve their raid performance in the slightest.
---
Don't need consumes, pre-raid "BiS", cookie cutter specs, or "proper enchants" to do any raid in Classic. It's easy mode. The only people who need to worry about consumes and gear are your main tank.
---
C l a s s i c
---
Nostalgia is winning for me. I was an enhancement Shaman throughout all of vanilla, all the way up to cataclysm where I stopped playing. I’m seriously leaning towards that spec again. It’s just so much fun for me. I don’t care about getting world firsts or any shit like that. Im just ready to have fun with the game I loved as a naive 18 year old.
---
What resources?
---
There's less clutter everywhere and much lower quality textures, the performance is much higher
---
I was thinking outside of battlegrounds, in raids, in dungeons, world pvp etc.
---
They can maintank my dude. Strait up. With the exception of a few encounters. But yes they will need vast more time more consumes just to do what a warr will do. But its absolutley viable and your not hamstringing yourself by being one. Just putting in way more work.
---
Theamatically if someone prefers a bear tank over a warrior they can roll druid knowing that they are viable tanks end game.
---
I think he was talking about his kid lol
---
I don't watch him?  My exposure to him has come from watching Esfand and Classic Cast.
---
&gt; It is no wonder retail is crammed full of micro transactions
---
How you know someone has no idea what they're talking about.
---
That's not this that works at all.
---
The  best healer is the one you think looks cooler
---
Honestly if over heating is the problem purchase a laptop cooler, they work great and aren’t expensive
---
The way I interpret it, also considering the other things Brack says, is that the QoL things missing in Vanilla would make people dread it the moment they experienced it again.  
---
You can bet he was not aware of the benefits of not having those QoL "improvements".
---
Booty bay was named after your mom's house.

(Sorry, just getting some practice in for the barrens chat)

Log out on the way and you'll stop at the first flight master on your path
---
Yeah private server culture was pretty strickt on having at least close to pre raid bis before you step into a raid. But then again this isnt private server culture. Gonna be interesting to see
---
It’s better now. Keeps AFKlers off the BG.
---
I didn't get my own account till burning crusade, I remember the stories about av and I remember in wrath doing av. I know it was a different time and didn't take as long but still could take like 2 hours from what I remember. If anyone is actually excited for 10 hour av, ur bullshitting yourself
---
I really find it odd that there's so much "*NOOO, IF YOU PLAY THE GAME THIS WAY YOU'RE PLAYING CLASSIC WRONG!!!*" sentiment around here.
---
...Yeah that's fair.
---
Prot is a different scenario than Ret is.
---
If your a Ret paladin who raids you very quickly hit the 50G cap on respec costs and usually in a week you do your raid days as Holy and then your none raid days as Ret.
---
If you are going Prot then there are actually a number of hybrid builds for Holy/Prot that you can basically build from day one and never alter your spec at all.
---
Blessing of Salvation alone is usually a strong enough arguement on its own to let at least one deep prot paladin in raids to keep the buff up, that being said you will essentially be healing as full prot and more be there to refresh the blessing more than anything and be OOM constantly.
---
Im in the process of buying my first condo have a fiance and soon to be step son.
---
I cant fucking wait to set up my cave and become a hermit for that week of august
---
Didnt they put in the "get off at next stop"?
---
Yeah. Very true. Always allowed time for tank to gain sufficient aggro.
---
I know it's the theme song but, I can only hear Will Ferrell singing it now.
---
If you can't see any of the legitimate criticism you're either not looking or you have no idea what qualifies as legitimate criticism. Pointing out that layering completely changes the dynamics of the economy is an entirely valid criticism that is frequently repeated on here. Recognizing that the lack of continuity of interactions caused by people being split between multiple copies of the world changes the community dynamic relative to vanilla is valid. Those are just two of the more common arguments that I've seen on here and there's plenty more that are justified criticisms not just feckless whinging as you're presenting it. Again, you're just doing exactly what the person you responded to was criticising blizzard for doing, picking out the worst examples and pretending that's all there is while ignoring the valid criticisms that are unquestionably true. Something like just saying layering wont change the economy doesn't change the fact there's no way it can't relative to a server consisting of a singular world.
---
Didn’t even open the post and I already disliked it
---
The pose is perfection too.
---
New player here, help me understand Hunter pets.
---
Does the level of the beast before you tame it matter? How do you ensure your pet keeps aggro so that you can keep using your bow?
---
Happy Birthday, Alliance Scum!
---
Very nice cake.
---
Has anyone checked player hp and mana at level 40 compared to 1.12 Vanilla?
---
I tried it yesterday and there were like 20 different AVs open at the same time. I thought they let in basically everyone.
---
Hey man i work physical labor so i know the feeling. You have to make time for your hobbys and interests or eventually your going to be really unhappy.
---
&gt; Which healer contributes most to dps? Either by way of buffs or their own damage.
---
shaman
---
&gt;Which healers can hold their own in 1v1? not just escape but actually kill.
---
&gt;Which healers quest efficiently, being able to do decent single target damage.
---
don't do quests as a healer. you can heal dungeon and group quests in non healing specs, while leveling.
---
not without the mushrooms at the base of their trunk they're not ;)
---
If the demand is there for it sure. I think anyone should have the chance but obviously making an expansion for the 50 people who enjoyed WoD isn't feasible.
---
I’m leaning the same way with spec and class. But I’m really stuck on whether or not I should optimize race. I love pvp and NE is definitely not the optimal choice.
---
Imagine thinking hours long AV's are better. AV is a boring bg either way.
---
15% more threat is not as much threat as sweeping strikes and mortal strike will add in a typical dungeon.
---
not sure if im bummed that blizz is using beta as marketing or bummed cause im not in
---
very few early patch AVs ended in quick rushes back in the day. Would they today? yes, but even on private servers about 1/3 AVs end up becoming turtles lasting 1-2+ hours. All it takes is a small group of 5-10 to dedicated defense with aoe and they can stall the entire BG into a turtle unless the opposition is a well organized premade. It will still happen on 1.12 AV, just not as often as earlier patch AVs would.
---
Marvel! 25% Stun Resist!
---
And frequently raided by groups of 10 guys
---
Maybe on the stress test?
---
Ok
---
Might wanna research what "third person" is
---
Thats it. Im going horde
---
it's the best for pve because nelfs have the highest base agi but stoneform is superior in pvp as it removes blind etc
---
A lie people tell themselves to avoid the truth that they need others to carry them through content.
---
Why not shaman dps? Is elemental bad in PVE?
---
Ya, OP doesn't take into account that being the weakest member of your raid isn't something most people aspire for.
---
Of course there was always competition on the DPS charts, but this does not at all contradict what I or the OP said. I raided with a number of guilds in vanilla and it wasn't until I was in a top ten guild that filling raids wasn't a challenge, and even then it was only because we had enough trust to share account info so we could bring the right raid composition without relying on specific people. People competed for top DPS in every guild, but that doesn't mean any of them were min/maxing for it. We had many top tens and a world first kill with PvP arms spec warriors in rank 13 gear. I healed in shadow spec until I got my PvP mount. No one was as serious as many of the min/maxers on the this sub except about showing up and doing their part, and that was what made all the difference. If you can regularly get 40 people to show up prepared for raids you can reliably clear any content in vanilla, min/maxing will just make it faster.
---
Hate em cuz you ain’t em. Plus Asmon is pretty entertaining
---
Hit the get off at next stop button?
---
Not entertaining at all.
---
&gt;Wow is already in a bad place with BFA so we wanted some change and we got it.
---
I dont agree with this argument at all. Sure it might apply in some cases but i never saw anyone asking for items to be slot machines with a chance of rolling higher level and more stats and stuff like that. It was blizzards idea. Who asked for azerite armor? Hell, people have been pissed since forever because blizzard removed pvp vendors, i legit didnt see one person asking for then to be removed and i didnt see one person against the idea of them coming back. But here we are without pvp vendors because apparently they were hard to find according to blizzard.
---
That's exactly how I played BC, showed up to the raid last second bought flasks from anyone who had extra usually didn't even paid for them and smashed the top of the meters.
---
Damn that’s unfortunate. Didn’t realize that stuff was gone in 1.12
---
I was watching musclebrah stream this morning, when I watched people said he was in the same AV for  2+ hours.
---
....eh that seems like a long shot to me man...
---
Asmo opinion videos is quite good imo
---
replying to save this
---
How do you both have beta access?
---
But its in California...
---
You can farm Lashers in dire maul if you take holy nova. That's quite good income
---
Idk if you realize but amson is not the person to blame for this. You need to blame all the people who make content from his streams.
---
Not all streamers are cancer. Just the ones who act like idiots to entertain other idiots. If there are Pepe memes and "POG" getting spammed in chat it's a good sign you should find someone else to watch.
---
Isn’t there a wow commercial with this same theme?
---
Pets get a taunt spell so aggro shouldn’t be a problem. You have to tame pets of different levels if you want to have all the pet spell ranks. For example a level 8 lion will have claw rank 1, but for you to upgrade his claw skill to rank 2 you’ll have to tame a pet that has claw rank 2. 
---
Also as your pet levels it gains loyalty points that can be used to teach it spells, I’m not entirely sure of this but I think it’s best to take a low level pet so it will get more loyalty points due to leveling by the time it’s 60.
---
1st off nah he’s literally the opposite of entertaining. Esfand is entertaining. My dog is entertaining. 
---
2nd off, I definitely DO NOT want to be him. I really don’t.
---
You’re in for a rude awakening when August rolls around. Everyone here compares classic to LFR difficulty, when it was *far* harder. Sure you can faceroll MC and much of BWL, but AW and Naxx will chew up and spit out all the “I just wanna have funnnnnn” specs
---
Hardest part is getting bis and making money.
---
What's watered down Vanilla.
---
Frozen Yogurt with Vanilla flavoring.
---
Human resources. Each death ticks your team down to zero.
---
Thats actually a really cool idea.
---
Use time on flight paths, boats, zeps or tram to set up UI.
---
I am sorry but your wall of text doesn't make these people who act like they are suddenly game designers, developers and business exprets in digital services or their "legit REEEES" fact. They are just uneducated opinions mostly. Legit feedback is drowning under all that bullshit pretty well. No matter how many walls of text you write that doesn't change.
---
Best of luck. 
---
If it's any help, maybe to clear up my own thoughts too: It doesn't take hours of theory crafting to look up a guide. 
---
And if someone doesn't care to do that, they probably don't care about whether they're good at the game or not, they're already trying to enjoy the game their own way. Maybe they don't need to be told it.
---
&gt;The items in naxx and aq are already astronomically better than BWL, making further raid content with better items would completely invalidate a lot of the older content, which is the same complaint about expansions.
---
If only there were solutions for this that blizzard already did in classic.. Blizzard buffed items during vanilla. I dont see why they couldnt just buff older items. There are many ways to do it. Slapping some stamina/armor on older gear would do wonders already. Im not saying its that simple but lets not oretend that a  solution simply cant exist because it can.
---
Just change layers, they kick u off the flight instantly
---
Too bad
---
You, uh, still gotta get into a guild with 40 capable raiders or find one that will let you be the puggie if you don't want to leave your guild of 5 friends.  Best way to stand out from the competition for raid slots is to meet some basics.
---
Same. I hope they seriously consider changing it. I'm sure they'll gather feedback at the end of the weekend and decide what to do with it.
---
I did AQ and Naxx as Demo lock, it's not hard to raid.
---
That is just how the "beta's" turned out now, back when vanilla cake out I was actually a beta tester and it wasn't for exposure, it was to actually try to get feedback on the game and find bugs/stress test.  It's been 13 years since then, now companies get huge exposure through their games through twitch and YouTube so betas have gone from testing to advertisements.  Blizzard is not stupid and knows they need to give their biggest streamers and YouTubers the beta so they can get the most awareness for the new release which will make them more $$$.  It's not favoritism, it's business awareness.
---
&gt; if you level a paladin expect to not even be in combat and just spend the night buffing and rezzing everyone.
---
Classic is 1.12, not 1.1
---
He might bring a few points here n there but generally his “opinion videos” are more like a narcissistic self-satisfaction rimjob between him &amp; his incel autistic Teenie fanbase.
---
&gt;Asmongold Plays the FIRST CLASSIC Alterac Valley in 10+ Years
---
that's a lie, he was wandering around stormwind keep for 20 minutes before he could figure out that you could only solo queue.  he got into AV 6.
---
Implying that Boomkins are viable? That cake is a goddamn lie.
---
Anyone care to explain just how the fuck I'm supposed to marry and divorce in only two months?
---
When the game was released multicores weren't really a thing. The original philosophy behind having dual+ cores was to allow for more smooth operation of multiple programs at a time not to equalize the workload of a single program. 
---
That being said there are two possible reasons why there is no multicore support in classic. One is the "no changes" mentality. The other is the possibility that it either conflicts with other backdoor operations due to the dated nature of information transfer or it is just simply more condusive to run on a single core given the capabilities of a modern single core.
---
That’s not exactly a meme spec is it? I would love to see a progression guild with a significant presence of enhance or ret or boomkin etc. sure some guilds will caddy along the bad specs, but that puts the burden on the other 39 raiders to carry.
---
Asmon, i liked him in the beginning. Now?
---
I've heard that alot of people are gonna make it their life goal to destroy these entitled streamers. Can't wait for the babyrage, haha.
---
EU, either Horde or Alliance :)
---
I totally get this. I’m just not a fan of asmon. He’s not really funny, so I’m missing the point of what type of entertainer he actually is. 
---
But there’s some great streamers out there. Esfand is just a super genuine guy, and swifty is just the innocence of a child trapped in a mans body. I love watching them both.
---
You are a scary person and I am worried about you.
---
&gt;I can't argue the point so I'll just keep repeating the same nonsense about the criticism being mostly shit while repeating appeals to authority
---
Oh I swear to god I hope they’ll streamsnipe his ass out of every stream he makes in classic. I thank god the ooga gang exists &amp; I hope they read this.
---
Yes! With Steven Van Zandt, known as Silvio Dante from the Sopranod, where imitates Al Pacino, saying this.
---
I didn't sub for Beta access. Truth be told, not too sure I'd play much in Beta either. Knowing that it'd go 'poof', just lets me have a small bit of patience for its proper release. 
---
I subbed to play a little WoW, and for those dead chat channels as a reminder to myself why I'm looking forward to Classic.
---
Either
---
1. Install a channel blocking extension (yeah, it's pretty dumb of youtube not to have the option)
---
or
---
2. Search for 'alterac valley -asmongold'
---
I was wondering about this earlier and I 100% agree. 
---
My guild raid comp was really bad - we had melee hunters, enhance shams, boomkims, a druid main tank, every meme spec and... no one cared. We farmed plenty of raid content. Top of the server? Nope, but we were having more fun.
---
If you can play whatever spec to 90/95% it's capacity, you'll be fine for the majority of content. Focus on *fun*,  enjoying the content, and playing how you want. Not sprinting to gear up or playing a spec you don't want to.
---
Complain on the forums about it. We have months and months left until that phase. There's time for it to change.
---
Mulgore is probably inspired by places like [El Morro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Morro_National_Monument) , especially since Taurens are kinda native american themed.
---
Did three games last night, all of them ended up around 3 hours... Lots of defense, wiping teams and making them respawn at their base. Seemed fine to me.
---
I don't really care one way or the other for streamers but that's kind of funny.
---
Proving the passage right seems to be a theme here.
---
I heard somewhere tauren hunters don't have a deadzone (or a very small one) is this true?
---
I thought that STV was based on Vietnam.
---
So when i remember how much fun i had in these marathon matches in early AV i remember wrong?  You know better even though you never experienced it?  I loved the early AV, but hated the "updated" version because it turned into a race instead of being a battle/war.
---
Who read this in John Staats's voice?
---
He had 100k viewers running through Deadmines...
---
I’d say that means pretty entertaining.
---
The biggest challenge isn't the content, it is the implementation of the content post-naxx. I agree that not rehasing prior raids/zones might not be the best. Improving the leveling, quest, and farming experience in Classic WoW is something that new content patches could focus on. For every raid patch, there could be a patch that enhances other aspects of the game.
---
A big reason WoW went so downhill is because Blizzard focused way too much on Raids. Making endgame all about raiding is what sunk WoW. Just look at TBC. It was all about endgame raiding.
---
I think they are different oxhorns
---
I am sorry but i have to repeat myself because i am right. Why should i change my message every time when there is no need? People who are wrong and don't know what they are talking about need to come up with new arguments all the time and change subject. But nice try thought.
---
I am honestly worried about you. Stop and think about what you are doing for a second. Your behaviour is scary.
---
Oh, I thought you meant keeping up with patches like raid patches, not level increases
---
I also got it, and I also don't know what it's for. I've scrolled through other recent posts but it seems that other posts about this have been deleted, so I still have no idea what is happening and I still want to know what is happening
---
No it's not, but it's not the optimal cookie cutter spec that people claim you need.  
---
protip: all the classes cookie cutter specs are actually dogshit for most raiding.  
---
I'm not sure about Enhance or Boomkin, but there are some fights in raids where Ret is Godlike. It's the only reason I don't consider Ret to be as memey as other specs. And every raid can be done with 39 people, if you are having trouble in a raid because someone is using a "meme spec", then that is a problem with the other 39 people.  
---
Hell, I'm sure there will be some people who try and do the whole Bear tank for raids. Brace for Pserver "theory crafted" bullshit.
---
Cry more you dumpster baby.

Funny I played 3 games last night and the server was packed, and 14+ different AV's going at the same time..... Didn't really see anyone complaining. Had a blast myself. All 3 games lasted about 3 hours, although two I joined in about an hour into the match.
---
They will get their come uppins when classic launch.  They will need an entourage like floyd Mayweather.
---
Resources are a TBC addition.
---
The original warlocks were shamans actually.
---
He’d be a sociopathic sex offender if it wasn’t for WoW. 
---
Now he’s just the ultimate narcissist, both characteristics are pretty garbage.
---
Dude no way people enjoyed 10 plus hour fights, you cannot convince me it was amazing. Sure prob the first two might have been cool but it was just another Bs thing about vanilla. I'm super stoked to play vanilla btw, but It did have problems
---
there is a metric shit ton of people who want to do content they weren't able to in vanilla WoW back then.
---
Many people actually did venture in BWL and I dont know anyone who will want to guild hop 5 times until he is in one serious enough to kill C'thun and defeat most or all of Naxxramas.
---
Guilds will cannibalize when you hit roadblocks which you will and the first question will be: "Who can we cut off, because he does less damage than the tank?"
---
Now the guild either starts getting serious and kick all enh shamans, rets, boomkins etc. because they *literally* do less damage than a tank or people will start leaving for greener pastures where they have a shot at serious progress.
---
At the very least players should be able to rank up in World PvP instead of being forced to do Battlegrounds.
---
Why is hunter dps so bad?
---
Because it's still possible to find a simple solution that the developers haven't considered.
---
It's easy to bitch and moan about layering, or if layering didn't exist bitch about crowded servers lagging up and massive queue times or dead servers down the line.
---
Any idiot can just simply complain, it's harder to accept the lesser evils or put forth a good idea to tweak a system. 
---
It's in beta for a reason, so they can test it out and make it better
---
Oh okay. I knew Gul’dan was a shaman.
---
You can go enhance just build nightfall and you’ll even be first in line for hand of rag
---
Thanks for the tip
---
I don't think that's fair, they completely overhauled talent trees before tbc was even announced.  Now whether those overhauls were a success is a totally different discussion, but they did try major changes.
---
It’s only fair their authentic classic experience gets altered if they alter ours. Fuck em.
---
THEN
---
DONT 
---
WATCH

---
The only thing more cancerous than streamers is the fucking whining about streamers by manchildren who don't realize they could choose to just shut the fuck up and close the browser window.
---
Call it depressing if you want, I don't regret any of all these hundreds of hours, never had that much fun with any other game since that time.
---
The only thing fun about AV is winter time when the hard packed snowballs spawn and you sit on the cliff near IW bunker in stealth and knock horde off the high cliff near the door while they are trying to enter the bunker and make them take dura fall deaths. Or sit on the bridge near alliance base and knock them off there as they run across
---
&gt; You say people don't know enough to govern in their or their communities own best interest, but I don't believe this is true. Furthermore, elected officials already don't govern in the best interest of the people, they govern in order to keep and accumulate as much power as possible.
---
I am going to quote George Carlin here: "Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that." And when it comes to direct democracy (at the very least) that is absolutely true. Most people have no clue of the consequences of (political) decisions. Just look at the Trump Base, look at Brexit ... those are just two recent examples that show that direct democracy should not be a thing, at least until the majority of people is sufficiently educated.
---
Otherwise, I agree that there are politicians (however many) that definitely do not act in the interest of the people and are just interested to fill their own pockets and gain/keep power. That gets me back to the point above: As long as people are dumb enough to still keep voting for those people, why should they change? As long as we cannot fix that problem, why do you think that would be better with any other system? People will still be beguiled and conned.
---
&gt; Anarchists generally believe that humans are able to self organize meaningfully without one person at the top with all the power, even in large groups.
---
I wish I could share that belief. I think I have given enough reasons as to why above.
---
&gt; Hypothetically in a Anarchist company, you could have a directer of fiances, or a team leader, the key distinction is that those people would hold that position with the mutual consent of everyone involved, and when it's necessary to do so.
---
So what makes you think that the people who need to consent are not corrupt? They could just not like the team leader (for whatever personal reason), although he is doing a great job. They will get him out of that position and the whole project suffers for it. People can be corrupt in any position.
---
Well, everybody know that STV is inspired from Vietnam, blizzard did a great job, you can even feel PTSD that people have from it ;)
---
his highs are higher than his lows are low but i dont like costume contests etc, streamers organize large scale pvp which has been cool to see. otherwise i hope they have smaller influence
---
I might agree if crushing blow wasn't a mechanic, I just don't see how using a druid MT wouldn't hamstring a raid. You'd take more dmg and deplete healers mana faster, it's not insurmountable but you'll always fairly behind compared to having a warrior.
---
But 1 druid would be great for OT because of the versatility and not wasting gear.
---
Relax.
---
I remember searching for group members like that aswell, good times

He's not the one making those videos, it's other people profiting off him

here ya go  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Stance\_dancing](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Stance_dancing)   
---
1st hit on google, took me 5 seconds
---
I think this is the sweet spot, they changed AV during Vanilla for a reason, I would quickly grow to hate days old AV's.
---
"so I can recreate it as it was"
---
but why?
---
This isn't correct at all. You can absolutely clear MC/Ony and even BWL without people having consumes and enchants. As long as the main tank has them people will just have to play 10% better.
---
Given that the average classic player will be 50%+ better than the average vanilla player, it's going to be a joke
---
Carry through content?
---
Boy, you’re going to be real confused when every raid that’s released gets cleared the first day. No one needs carrying in classic lmao
---
Yup, it’s how we’ve made it this far
---
Posting from my main Reddit instead of my work Reddit, lol. 
---
Glad to hear you're thinking Druid :). If you play them with the right mindset they're one of the most fun/powerful classes in the game. I never had to  Respec, I ran the PvP healer 8/11/32 all of vanilla. It allows Feral Charge for important mobility/spell interrupt, has the 8 points for more efficient shifting, and then grants Swiftmend - which provides the burst healing druids lack otherwise. 
---
For gold, stealth helps. Being able to stealth to resources and then Soothe/root/hibernate is awesome. Personally, I plan to race to 60 In a couple weeks to farm devilsaurs, but long term, I'll probably swap to Mining/eng. I farmed enough gold to grab my epic mount in 1.4, I'm one of the few people left that has an ancient Frostsaber - I'm about as proud of that mount as I am my gladiator Netherdrake :).
---
The landmines in pservers are insane, I didn’t start playing vanilla until close to 1.12 so I never experienced them back then, but they do change the dynamic quite a bit if the pservers gave them close to accurate
---
It's really not that difficult. Some of your abilities can only be used in a particular stance, so you make a macro to switch to that stance and back whenever you want to use them in your rotation.
---
Yeah we are F&amp;F from before the streamers got invited. Not that they ruined anything at all, us stopping had nothing to do with that invite wave.
---
Gang? Since when are we calling suicide terrorists a "gang"?
---
Tldr if you want rank 14 be ready to play 12 to 16 hours a day hopefully in a premade pvp group for at least 12 to 14 weeks straight.
---
The more plausible thing to me is that suits told Classic devs "Sharding or nothing", because it is safer. Of course no one would tell this to us.  
---
Now they have to do what they can (LaYeRinG!) to try and calm down the community, because it is happening.  
---
And I can wildy wrong, of course. But does it really matter if I am or not?
---
I am hoping that the actual reason isn't #nochanges. I get it on some things, but others...not so much. I guess I didn't even think about the #nochanges mentality creeping this deep into the game. 
---
Since Classic is build on modern infrastructure, shouldn't the information transfer be modern, as well?
---
but why do you hate him so much?
---
Do you get a separate keyboard and mouse ?
---
Do you really want to heal? If you want off spec That is very understandable---
---
but you are asking the wrong questions for that. If you want to hybrid, every healer can do that but items. builds. goals, all come into question.
---
Before anyone could actually give good advice you gotta state what you want out of your experience.
---
I have healed, tanked, dpsed in this game for a very long time and it always comes down to desire. Gimmie a pm or a response to this and I can give you a bit of info, or not. If you want a good answer, it isnt as simple as that.
---
But if I don't watch it how am I supposed to bitch about it?
---
Nah I think it’s just ”old” grumpy men mad that they wont be able to put in the time/effort to play optimal &amp; they get their panties in a bunch when they see these other players who have all the time in the world to play at their best &amp; will do so
---
Or they’re just mad that these ”optimal” players will shit on them in pvp, it’s one or the other
---
How many guilds are going to raid Thursday and Sunday. How many guilds are actually going to raid.

People really underestimate the logistical nightmare that was vanilla raiding.

I don't think OP is complaining about the content as much as he is complaining about seeing those awful headshots on his feed over and over. To be fair I'm really sick of it too. Never even watched Asmon, Tips or Esfand but I get bombarded by their content non-stop.
---
It's not that bad. But two reasons:
---
1. hunters only have a few abilities used in a raid that scale with tier gear and weapons : aimed shot, multi shot, and your auto shots. Arcane shot and serpent sting scale with spell power, and I think some but not all of the traps do too. 
---
2. Your pet doesn't scale at all outside of talents, and has no survivability against high damage raid boss abilities so it's hard to keep it alive to consistently do damage. 
---
Compare that to a warrior, which has more abilities that benefit from getting better gear. Heroic strike, mortal strike, rend, whirlwind, bloodthirst, revenge, overpower, etc all scale from the warrior getting better weapons and gear. Same with a rogue and their abilities, or a mage or warlock with spell damage gear.
---
However hunters have a mobility advantage over all of those classes, meaning they will have more opportunities to do damage to the boss over the course of a raid fight than most other classes, especially casters, because they can move around and still  do their maximum dps.
---
&gt;I am curious how bad it could get abused.
---
How does Naxxramas solo sound?
---
But whyyyyy a jpg? :(
---
If its EU horde i will consider it! :)
---
He honestly looks and sounds autistic. I fucking hate his annoying ass. I can’t figure out who is watching his streams... 12 year olds I hope?? That would make sense. Anyone 18+ who watches this guy should be checked into a mental institution.
---
Red Rock canyon is in Nevada, not Utah
---
Smells like a ninja downvote to me!
---
Which streamer touched you when you were younger?
---
I was not expecting all this bitching.  I guess people are mad they can't play.
---
The endgame isn't the whole game. Having too much new content solely for level 60s and not enough for everyone else is what starts the whole "the game starts at 60" mentality. And even at 60 there's still stuff like the Dungeon Set questline. For people who never raids that *is* their endgame. They'll want new content too.
---
well done recognizing that it's just the animation speed that's changed and not the animation itself
---
Original AV was much harder. There were roaming enemies that respawned and the final bosses were very tough. 
---
I am not sure if level 58s would have been able to kill Drek.
---
Spread your vacation days, do not take them all at once. At the very least do a week at a time.
---
If you plan to raid there’s no reason you shouldn’t try to play optimally no matter how old you are. You’re disrespecting 39 other people’s time if you think it’s ok to come to raids and do shit dps or healing
---
I don't know if engineering is worth it if I'm not gonna be PvP'ing a lot. It seems more of a money sink than a money maker to me.
---
The people who clear raids the first day aren't the same people who play with 50% effort
---
You seem to be citing the fact that players were talking among each other to refute someone claiming that Blizzard didn't talk to players
---
ಠ\_ಠ
---
90% of ppl watching him are between 18 and 35, just regular dudes who choose to watch him for reasons their own. why do you have this immature hatred towards somebody you've never met before??
---
Let’s get real......Batman, would be the hero we all truly need. Instead of fighting he would bring together Louis lane and pepper pots to bring tony and Superman to a stand still. Thus allowing him time to convince both sides that they are all on the same side  and instead of fighting he would try to get everyone to work together.....that’s what makes Batman so great, he doesn’t be a hero to win or beat the bad guy but to ultimately be a hero and do what’s right for the greater good
---
Enchanting is a waste of time and a HUGE gold sink.  Only do enchanting if you will be part of a hard core raiding guild and will be the guild's enchanter.  Otherwise you will never get the rare recipes that actually allow you to make money with this profession.  Enchanting on a paladin is also kind of weird.  Better choice would be mining/engineering
---
You only need active subscription and none of the games. So your family doesn't need to upgrade to BFA. And you can reserve names on 3 accounts if they are subscribed. :)
---
I love the momentary pause of utter confusion, lol.
---
Shhhh, we need more non orcs in battlegrounds. 25% stun resist seems more like 99.9%.
---
Meh, either the servers will die in a fire and I'll spend the time playing PoE and memeing on comms about how shit blizz are, or I'll get out ahead of the pack and have a much better time leveling. Either way it's a week off work :P
---
He does have the most punchable face of all wow streamers, yeah. And he cant shut up for his life.
---
yes its obvious, not really mechanics except paying attention. i was the #1 rogue because i had the best gear and sometimes other rogues who were close but rarely topped me asking if i was doing anything special and i was like no dude, just pressing 3 buttons.
---
People vote for pain and against good things. Just a little glitch in humanity.
---
People keep saying this but they’re dead wrong. AV pre 1.12 was miles different. I regularly entered the same AV the next day and that was as late in vanilla as 2006.
---
1.12 was the doom of classic pvp. You had cross realm battleground (effectively ending server community). And the nerfs to the system just made it more accessible and thus dumbed it down.
---
They really should have considered 1.11 (Naxx patch) as the go to patch. Yes they may have not had the actual client, but they can edit the one they have.
---
Yes. EU Alliance. I need this.
---
Nostalgia. Also I love it . The face with the gap between the teeth is no longer in the game. Damn you cataclysm!
---
Yes, yes I have. That is why I included "(unless of course you are salary)" in my original post
---
I get that part I just don't get your comment
---
nein, but there were some very interesting birds.  up on kilimanjaro there were some gigantic raven-like things, and hanging around our hotel there were these even bigger birds which i think were Shoebills.  they were very odd, they'd just sort of hang around watching you and occasionally swoop down like the grim reaper or something
---
Spoken like someone who has never progressed past MC.
---
yes.
---
I mean it is a free service backed by an algorithm with an apparent content vacuum besides streamer videos. What is it people expect?
---
Your sister. 
---
Before she created a twitch channel to show off her boobjob she got from donation money by Asmons white knight fanbase.
---
I don't mind the downvotes. Old, inexperienced me would have downvoted too.
---
I get that but i dont understand your comment?
---
The king of repetitive nonsense.
---
Aye precisely. He seems utterly ignorant, as did the company as a whole, to the damage they were causing by streamlining things. You can think me wrong, but i don't see how retail isn't definitive proof of this.
---
It is most definitely still advised.
---
Download a client from a private server and set up your stuff there. Copy the WTF folder over to the real classic client when the time comes.
---
That's the only thing I can think of that might work.
---
That’s EXACTLY what I mean.
---
My experience as a rogue in tbc and wotlk was that you'll have plenty of competition, but even top guilds have someone not pulling their weight on DPS and likely to be replaced. Your reputation will matter a lot, so I recommend min/maxing the best you can.
---
They can't do much on a PVE server.
---
Hating someone is always immature? Lol? I’m supposed to be like Jesus and love everyone?
---
I never played super old AV, is the main issue the captains not being beast enough?
---
Asmon holds the rights to his likeness and can put an end to it if he so desires
---
Just sayin, I don't think he was complaining about the content so much as it being stuffed down his throat.
---
How was Kilimanjaro?
---
we didn't take the game seriously at all.  our main hunter would try to kill me by misdirecting agro onto me when he knew my vanish was on cool down.
---
You could probably charge people to come see the phenomenon
---
I understand the nochanges thing, but the old animation wasn’t better or “cool looking” imo.
---
People like him are the biggest reason we even have classic coming lol
---
She got donations before she opened her twitch channel?
---
Way less ppl will clear naxx than you think. Pservers have the most hardcore fans and very few still clear naxx
---
I’m down if it’s US horde!
---
That's not going to work.
---
It is definitely based on your weapon damage though.  Yes it replaces a normal attack, but it hits harder with a harder hitting weapon.
---
I got rid of it a few weeks after Cata launched. I remember playing during TBC and Wrath and sometimes people I played with would quit, and I wasn't able to understand why they were quitting because it was so much fun. Then Cata and boom.
---
Play classic however the fuck you want, casual, semi hardcore, hardcore whatever nobody cares! If they do care then that's their problem. Everyone has their own unique experience playing wow so enjoy it how YOU want to. Ignore the naysayers and just have a fucking blast playing this epic game!
---
Stuffed down his throat? Give me a fucking break. He is not being forced to watch anything. What he is upset by is Youtube suggesting a video. Imagine being upset about a suggestion.
---
It's pretty decent really.  There is a secret to it though.  Idk if I can tell you.
---
You can start at 20 if you take 1 in Imp. Blizzard instead of Cold Snap.
---
Why would you be first?
---
Well sure it’s on the internet but most (every mmo I have played) MMO’s have repercussions for those. So in the multiplayer game community yes they are unique to pservers not just wow ones.
---
Every TOS I have seen has specific wording against racism and physical threats. So to act like an mmo is just going to have them is ignorant.
---
It might be account bound, yeah. I don't think there's another way though.
---
Or maybe wanted 1.7 AV that actually had all the content and not 1.12 AV which is just modern AV without resources.
---
I was more the last scenario, sad to hear pets suck in vanilla so much :(
---
Your in for a rude awakening
---
Something about 3 houses in classic, idk what he’s trying to say
---
So...why did you stop?  You just got bored?
---
&gt; A politician will tell you whatever people want to hear to get elected, and then will not represent the people who elected them, they have always done this and always will do this under representative democracy.
---
But only because people still vote for the liars and conman. If the voters weren't so stupid to keep voting for them just because they are in whatever party, then lying would no longer be a viable strategy in the long run. It's all about consequences, if there are none, then why change anything?
---
If you are focused on reaching 60 in a reasonable length of time, do not gather.
---
Hit 60, then you can power your way to 300 skill in any gathering profession with no trouble at all.
---
If you're aiming to run enchanting, the Tailoring is the only real option that complements your choice (and the mats drop off mobs rather than nodes), craft greens and the occasional blue as you level for a small boost in enchanting mats, but do understand that Enchanting is a gold-sink.
---
The second culling is the last few bosses in AQ40.
---
I really dislike all these maps. Please stop. Classic isn't changing. You're an artist clearly. Start suggesting this for BFA. Your efforts will be better received
---
&gt;how often for a Warrior DPS I'll have to dance to use my abilities?
---
If you speak of DPSing in raids, then, tbh, almost never. You can dance for Overpower, but the DPS increase, even if played perfectly, is quite small.
---
This is such horseshit wannabe nutritionist shit talk
---
Investing in the weapon, plus hand is pvp weapon so lots of guilds give it as reward to nightfall swinger
---
Things have apparently changed since John Wick. I remember during the The Matrix hype, that so many people were saying he was a shit actor. Not that I agreed with that. But it goes to show that public opinion is fickle.
---
I mean, you can have horseshit, im not stopping you.
---
Why are you so worked up about this? It's just one guy venting on a forum. It's genuinely annoying to have to wade through all this garbage that the algorithms think you want to see but you don't. You don't have to agree and you don't have to comment on it if it upsets you this much, my dude.
---
Its not this black or white imo. Ofc during leveling and mount farming its a sink. 
---
But u still will get some formulas and make money by enchanting/disenchanting for other random guys. For example if u get the crusader formula early every random will come to you.
---
Im going mage,starting with skinning enchanting,then at 60 dropping skinning  for tailoring,then dropping tailoring for herbalism after my archmage robe. Sounds a bit crazy but i like it
---
Couldn’t get into to raids as a pug or while in a raiding guild?  
---
Rogues have one thing working against them in that they don’t bring anything to the raid other than themselves. I think getting into a guild sooner than later and being viewed as a helpful, friendly guild mate should pretty much secure you a spot when the guild is ready to raid.
---
Dude the game has been out for how many years? How long have people been clearing these raids on private servers where bosses are OVERTUNED? 
---
You guys are delusional holy shit
---
Posting from my main account :).
---
For leveling, in 1.12, hard to beat feral. I hate it, being a world class gladiator and then having to just run around as a fucking cat, but it's by far the fastest spec unless you're leveling in a set group that needs you as a tank or healer. Feline Swiftness, the crit talents, etc, make you a super efficient killer with practically zero downtime that never needs to drink/eat. 
---
For raiding, yeah, mostly. Every spec is reduced to their most efficient means. Healers use their Mana efficient spells, melee has a specific rotation, etc. As a druid, you're responsible for reacting to "oh shit" moments. 
---
Huge crit on the tank? No one else can respond like you can with a huge NSHT.  It's also up to you to decide if you can get away with just a Swiftmend or if they need the big NSHT.
---
Dps lags and doesn't move for mechanics/dies? Rebirth him.
---
Tank dies near the end of the raid? NS rebirth him to finish it off quickly.
---
Priest is going OOM? Mage is OOM for a big DPS phase? Innervate them.
---
Random raid members taking odd damage, but paladins/Priests cant use their cast time/gcd? Toss a rejuv on them.
---
Nothing major going on - cast a rank 4 HT as needed.
---
You're constantly watching and need to be aware of the entire raid for big moments. Your job is to know what is going on, what is coming next, and how your big cooldowns should be spent (Rebirth, innervate, NSHT, etc).
---
If you are considering warrior dps - I love the warrior class (I had a warrior alt, but it was prot). They're gear dependent, sure, but dal rends will last you quite a while, devilsaurs can be bought, and the class is fun as hell to play.
---
&gt; and the server was packed
---
No, the server literally was never below Low.
---
Lol dude ugly AF
---
And every raid encounter is overtuned on pservers. Which is my point. 
---
People are going to fucking fly through this shit
---
An unbuffed meme spec does 1/6th the dmg of a world buffed and consumable dps. If everyone in your raid doesnt give a shit you just wont clear raids
---
I really like the content displayed, clearly a lot of work went into it! 
---
The only thing I would potentially change is making any of the rewards a higher level than Naxx. I really like all the raids/content discussed, but I can see power creep being an issue. I think you could keep the highest raids mentioned at the same level as naxx with maybe some form of additional reward, resist gear for the next raid or specalized gear that somehow makes meme specs (ret, boomkin, etc.) more viable, a mount that has a 1% drop rate - I'm sure people have better ideas but you get the concept.
---
Wild hair idea: you could make 2 or 3 of the patches consecutive where the rewards directly lead into each other. For example, a raid that only drops resistance gear, then next a zone that has severe weather effects or other dangers that can only be traveled with gear dropped from the previous raid. Or an entire raid that is actually an attunment quest for the next zone. Where the raid entrance and exit actually lead from a previous zone to a new one and the only way to originally get to the new content is through the new raid until you run it enough times to get a portal or something outside of the exit.
---
The content inside the new zone could be optional, like the winterspring tiger quest grind. For people that want additional challenge and content but isn't going to make previous challenges meaningless. Something that very few people would actually put the time in to do so when you saw the reward on someone you would be suitably impressed.
---
I dont mind people making content, but I HATE the people who do "Asmongold reacts to nixxiom reacts to madseasonshows top 10 items in classic wow"
---
As dps warrior you mainly use one stance. Fury is the most common spec for DPS in raids. Then you mainly use berserker stance. As you level up you will slowly learn each stance so don’t worry too much about it. :)
---
Yes they will
---
jokes on you, I already stopped before I even read your comment 
---
also some of the maps I've made have gotten over 95% up votes so they're already pretty well received, the only thing that was largely disliked was the comment on each of my posts that said "no changes".
---
Wasn’t a thing in vanilla, I’d be surprised if they kept it in for classic
---
Sound like month of wasted game time :D
---
Upvoting so more people can see the superiority complex all over that page. Players are definitely qualified to give legitimate criticisms and speculations as to why a given company makes a change.
---
If you go to your favorite restaurant and suddenly the burgers are replaced with tofu (not that this is bad) and the salads were made from grass; you would complain. So when the chef says "you don't know what it's like in the kitchen" do you immediately retract all your grievances or laugh in his face and walk out?
---
I’m in, let’s do it. Resto shaman baby!
---
Ironically his post is a garbage post in the way of proper content in this subreddit. It does upset me that OP and you are this entitled and pissy considering you (most likely) are grown men in your mid 20's to 30's. It concerns me that this community is going down the crabber just like every private server community was filled with angry, entitled bigots who should be mature adults.
---
Live to win.
---
Eats cake... needs to drink after every bite.
---
I know this is a nice sentiment, and I definitely feel the same way, but having it posted every day is devaluing it, imo.
---
Reward?   You already get to be the enhance shammy in the group. That is a privilege in and of itself, so why does that entitle you to get hand of rag too? You won't be using it in raids.
---
Yeah... he didn't really think it through...
---
I mean also I don't have any siblings, but we can gloss over that for the sake of his "come back"...
---
&gt; Some extremely good players are going to play a meme spec and kill you for the humiliation factor.
---
False, good players do not play meme specs.
---
Why would he though?
---
People are driving nothing but traffic to his channel because of it...
---
Free advertising for him, 0% effort, 100% reward.
---
The badlands is inspired by the badlands South Dakota
---
Ally scum
---
A tip for the future: use google to search this (or any) specific sub. Reddit’s built-in search indeed sucks but google picks it all up just fine. You can specify to google where to specifically look when searching. 
---
Maybe using the most powerful search engine on the planet instead of calling people a dick because you didn’t like their answer will get you further. Just a thought.
---
I have fond memories of the old honour system.
---
You’re going to be confused when you see over half the guilds on your server struggling to consistently clear content. It only takes one or two people to make mistakes on a couple of bosses in certain raids and cause wipes. 
---
Don’t have people who can kite properly on razor? Wipes. 
---
Don’t have tanks who can manage threat properly or transition properly or people who can’t watch threat meters on Vael? Wipe. 
---
Don’t have people who know how to pay attention on chromag or people who don’t use sand properly? Wipe. 
---
The raids don’t get any easier after BWL, I think you severely underestimate the average wow player. I’ve led raids on almost every xpac and if there is a raid boss, someone will cause wipes unless you’re in one of the few top guilds on a server
---
Complete nonsense.  Every decision is made with speculation on how much cheaper it is to do and how much more money they can make.  This is because Activision is a publicly traded company and the #1,2 &amp; 3 rules for any publicly traded company is value to the shareholder.
---
Thanks lol
---
Back in Vanilla you could tame some very rare pets with rare moves (spells etc). Your pet was whatever it was when you found and captured it. You had to train the pet up to your level and that applied to all of your pets, if you got a rare tiger which was level 10 and you were level 60, you had a lot of work to do... and rightly so. Even so my huntard has a good number of rare pets.  The pets don’t always keep aggro at lower levels and often died, all part of the fun my friend :D
---
\*\* removing someone from the (full) blacklist \*\*
---
sigh
---
You really overestimate how long itll take for shitters. Naxx is a 15 boss raid without buffs and prep most guilds dont raid enough in a whole week to clear it
---
nah
---
Yeah... I'd say irrational/unfounded hatred is pretty immature lmao
---
You've got some anger issues, Mr Islam
---
You can blame that less on 1.12 AV sucking and more on them refusing to give out new invites after their first wave of twitch streamers. There isn't enough people in the beta to push a server higher than Low
---
Horde don't have humans
---
Maybe for you it's something bad, but as experienced player i hate questing in vanilla. If you miss any important quest or chain you have 2 options:  
---
\- change zone  
---
\- grind.   
---
I want to skip lvling, get 60 as fast as possible and finally begin my favourite part of vanilla - raiding.
---
I don't want to loose weeks something, what do not allow me to do something what i did since last years on privs.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
He is specifically referring to the premade level 58's on the beta server, not classic as a whole.
---
Man I'd love to hear what people at Blizzard think about these maps.
---
Neltharion is already Deathwing. Has been known as that since the War of the Ancients (10,000 years ago).
---
I hate him as well. Good clown for five year olds clicking I guess?
---
dead servers due to tourists is not a minor problem
---
there's a very big expectation to this launch, if it goes as many here and everywhere think, it'll be massive and far larger than vanilla with plenty of tourists
---
layers address that issue so that they can keep a controlled amount of servers and people still play, to me, mergers are far more problematic but that's my opinion of course
---
That is a really good question. Both of them.
---
And boom goes the dynamite.
---
I think it probably has more to do with the fact that  we're all waiting and having nothing vanilla related to do except either watch content creators or complain about them to be honest, but I see where your coming from.
---
I don't feel entitled to anything except voicing my opinion, which I did. And I wouldn't say I'm particularly pissy about it. Certainly didn't mean to come off that way atleast. I was just saying that I think you misinterpreted what OP was complaining about.
---
https://youtu.be/f7EVBzCeFaM?t=44
---
Yeah... but that doesn't get cheap karma ;)
---
The AV 1.12 is not the AV that could last for days. And we did know how to play it back in the day but it was just much harder
---
can you puke away please
---
Took me 5 seconds too. But I wanted to have more direct opinions from experienced players.
---
But thank you.
---
People don't think things through.
---
With regard to layering, the answer is actually pretty obvious. Blizzard learned the hard way with servers the first time around. They made way too many, which created a myriad of technical and social challenges as the game's popularity waned.
---
Blizzard wants to provide a good experience for players on launch, but at the same time they want to create as few realms as they can get away with. Not even just because it saves them money, but because it's better for the long term health of the game. Ideally, they never want to be in a situation where they have to create connected realms again. Their solution is layering. And while it's not a perfect solution, it is better than the alternatives.
---
I don't know what to tell you. best of luck though
---
WoW’s current state or success are not the same as whether the game is “good” or “bad.” 
---
Sub numbers can allow us (those who don’t work on the game) to make our own objective assessments of the state of the game or it’s success. What I’m saying (and what the comment you originally replied to was saying) is that you can’t objectively say WoW is “good” or “bad.” You can offer your subjective opinion on whether it’s good or bad, but sub numbers aren’t universal proof that it’s objectively good or bad. 
---
To use your own examples, many of the highest grossing films each year aren’t nominated for awards, and those that are almost never win. Those that win are quite often low-grossing films and plenty are indies that extremely few people have seen. A film’s gross and it’s award performance are two different measures of its success. One is objective and based entirely on numbers. The other is subjective based on people’s opinions of the film. 
---
You can say WoW isn’t as financially successful as it once was. You can say that the game is losing its audience. (Those objective statements can be backed up with data.) You can say you think it’s bad. (That’s your subjective opinion, which nobody can say is wrong.) 
---
You can’t say it’s objectively bad.
---
What a silly thing to get so angry about. There are much worse people in this country, far more deserving of your hatred. Ilhan Omar would be a good place to start.
---
Did we read the same post?
---
&gt; If you want a harder game you should stick to retail
---
If it was Thereamore =&gt; Auberdine you have time to level up a Char from 1-60 on Retail while you fly there.
---
We are playing on 1.12 for the most part so Kazzak should be chained to Blasted Lands.
---
The ZG Ebola and BA from Vael should probably work though so you can do some ANELE shenanigans.
---
I'd rather they treat everyone equally.
---
Thank you! You actually made me less anxious about the class. :D
---
&gt; People keep saying this but they’re dead wrong.
---
Because they never played Classic AV, or Classic at all. Notice the guy you're replying to also posted earlier in this thread claiming that during vanilla it would be a 40v40 grind in the middle "until resources ran out". He's a bullshitter who didn't even play back then.
---
The vanilla version was to just relog.
---
You sound like someone who’s cosplaying as a Brony while jerking off to Minecraft porn.
---
Missing the point. This won’t happen in Classic and isn’t tolerated in any mmo that isn’t some shady seedy privately ran PoS.
---
People will and do get banned for it.
---
True
---
I like the "Hidden Content" approach. Like, you won't be able to tell that Prince Thunderaan was added to Silithus unless you see someone doing the Thunderfury quest. You won't know that the Dungeon Set questline added a bunch of new bosses to dungeons unless someone in your party chooses to summon one. In either case the locations are indistinguishable from before when the new content was added.
---
With the right zone story they could add plenty of content to Azshara without altering the original experience at all.
---
/camp
---
Not him though he didnt do shit for Classic
---
Yea but don't tell everyone that, dude. Remember "classic is the hardest thing ever" and anything else is just wrong. Nothing hard about WoW as long as you have time to commit.
---
Thanks, I'll learn more about macros!
---
Yea well anger issues and Islam goes hand in hand
---
pros:
---
- met a bunch of great people
---
- nice feeling getting to the summit.  for the last 100m of climb (which takes about an hour) i listened to Scotland the Brave on repeat and I insisted on being the first in our group to get there so I could fly my flag haha
---
- epic views, when flying in/out and when up the mountain.  particularly sunrise on summit day was incredible
---
- saw some cool wildlife
---
cons:
---
- it cost about £3k (it was worth it though)
---
- it didn't really feel like much of an achievement.  if you're lucky and don't suffer much from altitude sickness (i had no issues) then it's really just a casual stroll over 6 days (we did the shorter route, the other route is like 9 i think)
---
- local guys carry your gear and you only have a tiny day sack.  It feels kinda lame walking up slowly when some local guy is power-walking up the hill with your huge bag on one shoulder.  They also set up your tents and food ahead of you.  On day 4, at like 14,000 feet altitude, we had fried chicken for lunch, eaten off fold-out tables with tablecloths...
---
for me, a reasonably fit individual with a decent amount of outdoor experience and no altitude sickness problems it was just too easy and convenient.  I'd like to do it while carrying my own gear and food, that would actually be tough going
---
Go to a doctor and tell you're very fuking suicidal depressed and you need atleast a 2 weeks off from the work.
---
I focus on the points :p
---
How close F&amp;F are you? Like, distant relatives, far or close friends? Were you invited to other tests, like retail alpha? The whole concept of F&amp;F is kinda foggy to me, so could you elaborate a bit, without giving out too much of course?
---
I played a mage in Vanilla and never saw that happen and I did jump from that spot millions of times.
---
Although I was a human but that shouldn't change much.
---
I imagine watching esfand pop off and to a lesser extent staysafe and struggling to get viewers even when continually hosted frayed some nerves.
---
mostly just no time, nothing to do with the game itself.
---
That's not why it won't work.  Wow Classic is being built on current Wow backend and a ton of stuff has been changed around.
---
Gnome males are really disgusting looking. They look cool in the art but it’s totally lost in game. Even with the new models they still look so bad.
---
Means nothing really
---
Since this thread is about the best spec you shouldn't argue that it requires try-harding to make it work.  
---
All specs OP proposed are viable, only one of them is capable of outputting the most DPS.
---
you're saying that anyone who wants to watch him should be checked into a mental institution. do you really think you and I are going to have a meaningful discussion on anything
---
Private servers use the old API and completely different add-ons. This doesn't work at all.
---
&gt; Imagine thinking hours long AV's are better.
---
Why aren't they? The whole "BG needs to be fast and short" is stupid retail logic based on you getting 99% of the value of a BG handed to you as a finishing bonus. 
---
Hours long AV is fine when you've got Classic PvP honour system, you can AFK out and rejoin any time, it isn't hurting you beyond a deserter. You can contribute to the war, leave, return, help again, etc. You're pushing toward a goal. You don't NEED to be in there for the victory screen pop up to get value from a BG like you do on retail.
---
Was his name Jon?
---
Watching videos and saying ok aint entertaining
---
I see you’re a man of culture aswell.
---
AV is a blast, but huge. Probably need a larger population to fully experience it. I love AV, I get it has flaws but I can't wait to get back to it!
---
I would like to know more about insane version of iron man
---
Could he beat cap though?
---
Pets can absolutely help tank an add in dungeons as long as he gets some heals. Raids not so much
---
Why do people call other people names? Do you like being a mean person? The fact that you didn’t pick up on the guys sarcasm just highlights how rude it is to call other people names. Geez people just be nice and treat other people how you want to be treated. It’s not hard.
---
Have you thought how rewards and titles should work then? Would there be own for both systems or just somehow balanced honor gain that would make them kind of equal for working toward ranks?
---
time u get sweeping strikes is around the time where dungeons need actual tank specced tanks or skilled healers of which there are few.
---
Problem with world PvP is it's too disorganized. What are the goals? World PvP is solely just searching for players, even if they don't wish to engage in PvP or are leveling and attack. I can understand that this has its merits, but with BGs you have an end goal. Tactics, team setup and communication are far more integral to winning.
---
The rush you get from coming back from 2/0 in WSG, and winning are far more rewarding than ganking a player who is either under geared/inexperienced, or lower level than you. It's not just a free for all cluster fuck which is what world PvP usually is. 
---
Well that's just my 2 cents but then what do I know. I played a paladin in Vanilla.
---

25 to 35 zone adjacent to moonglade felwood and winterspring?  Am I missing something here?
---
Are you sure it wasn't inspired by Vietnam?
---
Pretty poorly written for an onion article. Looks like it was written by a redditor who thinks they're a r/writingprompts is gonna land them their big break some day.
---
It does kind of make you wonder.   The sith always seem stronger than the Jedi.
---
I never waited more than like 10 minutes to run what I wanted because of whispers. I played lock though so had the added benefit of being able to summon people which opens up the list of possibles massively.
---
Protip, take a warlock as dps and make groups fast. Laugh at the 3 groups spamming trade for a tank while your party summons one in.
---
it looks like you're walking on an invisible mesh platform from where the base of the tower model is actually standing.
---
Soooo someone accidentally added an invisible wall/floor when they rebuilt stormwind.
---
This is awesome! I'm going to be playing Classic with some friends, and I think they would genuinely enjoy this addition to our dungeon runs!
---
Me too... A completely different animation for a huge portion of your class is not minor. Some may think it is but it's objectively not.
---
In the beta, items like that instantly respawn, which is definitely in line with how I remember them
---
Hell no
---
F&amp;F is usually a term thrown around by people that may or may not actually be part of the smaller group tests. When you're part of a F&amp;F test it's not always 100% everytime that you get invited. We usually end up messing around with test builds or new projects due to being closely tied to both development on certain projects and the art side. Just because we have family involved in certain things doesn't mean that we get to "know" everything about the inner workings of future projects. I only see / test what I'm shown right, and that may not be the next big thing coming out.
---
Yeah, you're right. To put it bluntly, while I was tired (still am) and wasn't thinking straight, I could have (and should have) easily been more polite. So to u/wayne62682, I'm sorry.
---
yeah, this was my least though out zone

I've changed it quite a bit since posting actually now it 35-45, and is connected to felwood and auberdine

---
&gt; Dude no way people enjoyed 10 plus hour fights
---
See, here's your lack of experience and general stupidity showing. People didn't play AV for 10 straight hours. It was the feeling of an ONGOING WAR that was good. You could log in at 3pm and do your part, get scraps, turn them in for the air attacks and handing out temporary buffs, maybe you contribute to taking down a tower. Log off, do your daily routine and come back at 9pm and rejoin that same war and continue your efforts. It felt like an ongoing day long conflict that you had a hand in helping.
---
You've got 'retail baby' written all over you, you have this stupid notion that a BG's value comes when the score screen pops at the end (retail logic, since the ending bonus is all the reward since honour handed out for killing is worthlessly low) and therefore a BG must be super short so you can be sure that you'll be there when it ends to get your bonus.
---
Pretty sure it's in the beta and will be left because you could accomplish the same action by hitting a different button.
---
Reminds me of this video, also one of my favs: https://youtu.be/zEET0tBbxNY
---
In martial skill sure, in strength, not a chance.
---
sometimes I get the feeling we've really been on our own too long.
---
It was an absolute blast putting this all together, and I completely underestimated how much was going on behind the scenes in every dungeon. There wasn't a single one where I didn't learn something new. This was a fun project, and I hope people can learn and enjoy the dungeons even more as we go through them again in Classic!
---
Yes, the animation is supposed to be slowed down which makes it look much smoother, and gives that iconic "slick" walking feel.
---
It really needs to be turned back. The faster walk animation looks so bad.
---
They’ve confirmed it’s staying in
---

Just so everyone knows, this is the guy that tried to defend TipsOut after we all found out he's a government defrauding piece of shit. You really want people like that leading you?
---
To me the zone reminds me a lot of the Nile Valley, the motives and architecture seem to be based on ancient egypt and the surrounding area. There are statues that look like Egyptian gods, you know the ones with animal heads. There are also pyramids.
---
Of course it's not a 1 to 1 replica of Egypt but usually any "ancient ruins in a desert" in fantasy have some sort of Ancient Egyptian inspiration.
---
Have you literally never even played this game? That's asinine.
---
Did we just become best friends!?
---
2h fury is better at the beginning when you don’t have much hit gear
---
I can't believe an opinion could be so wrong.
---
I personally think the "new" fast walk animation looks much worse.
---
Stranglethorn vale is based on South East Asia, more specifically Vietnam.
---
It's the retarded world buffs.   Hunters don't scare with world buffs that well.  Back in Vanilla we barely used them, but now they're exploited on the pirated servers.  It's too bad blizzard doesn't give a fuck anymore, so they probably won't fix exploits/bugs like this and annihilator.
---
Way to take one sentence out of all the post.
---
He's driving the point home that Classic is more about the community experience rather than try harding for Min-Max optimal raid runs.
---
“Cosplaying as a brony” doesn’t even make sense but nice well rehearsed insult. You’re definitely not 12 years old mentally.
---
Hes always been good at the roles he played imo. Even Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures. He just plays the part so well that it's hard to pinpoint which parts of his acting are character inspired or personal inspired.
---
I'm trying to decide between Human Paladin and Dwarf Priest.  My brother and I played Classic and TBC back in the day, his main was a shaman and I played druid.  This time around we want to mix it up and go Alliance.  He is definitely going Human Warrior and I want to be a good duo support partner for that.  I think I could have fun with either of these classes, but just can't decide.  At endgame I am hoping to do a lot of PvP, and might be able to swing some raiding for MC/BWL depending on schedule as I have a wife and kids now.  Here's how they sit in my head.
---
Paladin PROs:
---
* Awesome "warrior of justice" type that can wear plate, shields, and swing big cool swords and axes like my brother's warrior.
---
* Probably the most durable healer in PvP and unlikely to be focused down as much.
---
* If I can get it, T2 armor is the coolest set in the game (and great stats for PvP)
---
Paladin CONs:
---
* Does very low dps even when specced for it.  As a druid I hated never really being able to kill people fast in PvP.
---
* Pretty much a buff-bot and flash of light spammer.  PvE gear is mostly cloth for healing.
---
* I'm worried that I'll get bored with the lack of direct damage abilities and mostly just auto attacking if I want to damage something.
---
* Leveling sounds awful
---
Priest PROs:
---
* Has great utility spells such as Mind Control, Mana Burn, PW: Shield, Fear Ward
---
* Healing is more nuanced and not just 2 healing spells, one of which is rarely used.
---
* Can spec Shadow for some actual damage if I have some gear, and get Silence which seems pretty good (though not as good as Hammer of Justice perhaps).
---
Priest CONs:
---
* Likely will be a huge target in PvP.  Even with shadowform, I would be much squishier than a Paladin with plate+shield.
---
* Shadow gear is going to be tough to get in raids potentially, as mages and warlocks tend to get priority on the best stuff.
---
* I like the roleplay of the Paladin melee, so this just doesn't seem as "cool" perhaps?
---
Can I get some perspective from people who have played one or both of these classes?  Please don't just give me cookie-cutter answers based on my pros &amp; cons.
---
AV is my favorite part of Vanilla. Groups have been undergeared and uncoordinated from what I've seen so far.
---
Yeah if cap lands a punch or a grapple its gg. He's good enough to at least land one I'd think
---
I'm too introverted. My best bet is to meet women through mutual friends. However I do not have many friends right now.
---
It's not about showing them anything, it's about not agreeing with their decisions and not getting strung along. That's within my power to decide.
---
Wow I always remembered them being blue, not pink. Paladins are pink...
---
Retail baby lol. Retail is garbage, and has been for a bit. Yes there was some cool shit added but for the most part it's pretty bad. You done praising and sucking classic wows dick? Yes it's going to be fun and I'm excited, but that doesn't mean classic is godly. I made my opinion saying no way ppl enjoyed playing av for hours and the classic dick rider got hurt. You are probably those ppl who complain about how streamers are ruining the game for you and destroying classic
---
I like the idea of a PVP competition to see who can PVE the fastest through a instance, which is what AV turned into.
---
Shut up leaf, be proud of your nation. Nothing wrong with a sense of national pride. You live there, you are part of Ontario -- you are entitled to that pride.

There are three main reasons to be a hunter over a mage imo. First, there's going to be a metric fuckton of mages, it's one of the most popular classes. It's always nice to be a class that isn't quite so populated because you stand out more. Second, it's way more fun. There's actually a lot to do while playing a hunter between pet management, damage rotations, kiting certain bosses, etc. Mages...pretty much sheep things and spam their main spell. Some people are okay with that because they do end up putting up bigger numbers in the end, but a hunter is more involved and fun to play. Lastly, there isn't much of a gap between them if all they do is spam the same spell over and over provided the bad one isn't pulling random stuff. Hunters, oh there's a difference. Learn to manage your pet well, be able to pull and trap effectively, you will quickly set yourself apart from the huntards. Which is nice. It's fun to feel like you're an expert at your chosen class and it's great when other people recognize as one too. 
---
I'm going to be honest I was in the same boat you were between mage and hunter, and as much as I love fireball, I just think hunter is the better choice for what wow classic is. Because it's not like retail where damage means everything because every class has access to almost every type of utility. Guilds are going to need hunters. Period. They need them for tranq shot rotations and they need them on certain fights for kiting like Gluth. 
---
You mention hunters being harder to play, I promise you that is not a negative thing, and you shouldn't think of it as such. The game in terms of your personal play is much, much easier than retail. Hunters have probably the most involved, "hardest" rotation, but it's still easy. The alternative? Spam frostbolt or fireball literally the entire fight. The hunter rotation isn't hard, but it isn't brainless, which is actually a source a fun when raiding. 
---
Some people say ammo is a negative, I don't think it. I think it's actually one of the small things that gives the hunter class a lot of flavor. In terms of pvp, hunters wreck battlegrounds and world pvp. Yes, eventually mages will scale past them in terms of damage output. But if you open on a mage from range with an aimed shot followed by everything else, he better have the reflexes to ice block early because that dude's still wearing cloth and your aimed shots can crit upwards of 3k when you have decent gear. Your traps can control battlegrounds like its your personal fucking zone and how dare anyone enter without your permission. 
---
I'll wrap this up because it's already pretty long. The deadzone isn;t as big an issue in pvp as you'd think. THe only class that can really take advantage of it is a mage, and a lot of them won't have the ability to do so effectively. I really think you should go hunter. Also, go orc if you like pvp. 25% chance to resist all stuns? Haha, fuck you rogues and warriors.
---
We need a word for those who smugly bash on “elitists” for trying to become better, and demand people only play to have fun unless fun is trying to become better.
---
Casual elitist.
---
Probably referring to the hidden "racial" where Tauren get an extra bit of range on their melee attacks, but it also allows enemies to hit you from slightly further away.  So yes, someone approaching a Tauren hunter would be in wing clip range sooner than if they were approaching a Troll hunter, but it also means they'll be in range to melee you sooner as well.
---
The island off the south east side even looks like Madagascar! Super cool design imo
---
Sucks the zone is a warzone and u can't quest without slaughtering an entire village worth of the enemy faction (or likely being slaughtered lol)
---
I see it more so encouraging people to not get caught up in optimizing and min maxing because it's just not needed. Plenty of people in Vanilla raided well with non optimal class/race combos because when they rolled them they weren't as informed.
---
They all still raided fine and had a great time.
---
His point is being missed. You don't have to be optimal, the MAJORITY of people don't care if you are, you will still get raid spots.
---
Don't worry, play what you want and optimize how you want, just know it's not NECESSARY.
---
Hey you run your guild as you see fit, I’ve been in multiple guilds that is how it went but then again we had loot council, not dkp playing enhance and buying nightfall to benefit the raid is not a privilege it’s a boring job that none wants to do, but like I said you lead your guild how you want I won’t argue who deserves what with you ,
---
Joining an AV just to know that you probably aren't even going to see the end result is just disappointing. What's the point when everything you do is just gonna go to waste because you have to leave before the game is even over? 3-4 hours is good, long enough to have it feel like a huge battle but not so long that it feels like a waste of effort.
---
I raid those days on pserver and intend to again. I did in vanilla too.
---
sorry, but I don't think we can have this conversation. you have a really short sighted take on this. racism, threats and other types of harassment exist in other games and is not unique to private servers. every terms of service of every video game has policies against harassment but that doesn't prevent a percentage of players from engaging in this type of behaviour. of course you spot it less in mmorpgs where the consequences could mean getting your account suspended, but with the increase in f2p models you see more and more people showing explicit behaviour because the worst that can happen is that they'll simply have to make another free account

I don't see any reason to not do it as long as I can send cloth to a tailor alt. It's the bop stuff I steer clear of as I want other professions than tailoring on my main.

They have good single target kill speed and little downtime at 60.
---
That combined with the PvP survivability seemed like a contender.
---
Hey you run your guild as you see fit, I’ve been in multiple guilds that is how it went but then again we had loot council, not dkp playing enhance and buying nightfall to benefit the raid is not a privilege it’s a boring job that none wants to do, but like I said you lead your guild how you want I won’t argue who deserves what with you.

That's how AV will always be. It is a shitty bg that everyone hates, but somehow this subreddit thinks it is good due to rose colored glasses and not playing it much on retail vanilla.
---
Was on a private server with multiple times the normal population, and it was hard to even have an AV game with more than a handful of people in it unless it was AV weekend. It won't be different when classic comes out
---
By the time 1.12 rolled around most of the midfield threats were removed. The trolls are gone so snowfall is a free capture, the minefield is gone, and most importantly the NPC damage has been MASSIVELY nerfed. So t if your goal is to win there's just no reason not to beeline Drek/Van and get it done, there is no more threat of certainly failure for doing so like there was in 1.7
---
Right, let's add some context since apparently you can't read:
---
&gt;The hardest part about classic is having 40 people show up on time and do a raid without any drama / disconnects. If you want a harder game you should stick to retail.
---
To some people, speedrunning and doing things optimally is the only reason for playing vanilla, and has made up a sizeable portion of the private server community over the years. They want this _harder_ version of the game. They love it. That's their prerogative. 
---
Telling them that they should stick to retail if they want any kind of difficulty is _precisely_ saying "play my way or do not play at all". There's no two ways about it.
---
There's no difference between an enh shaman having nightfall and not.  It's just a weapon.  He would still just stand there and auto atk, because that's all he can do.
---
Sudbury region used to be really uh... Blasted looking due to deforestation and industry (not sure about the latter). In more recent years it's gotten a lot better.
---
I don't know if that's what they're referring to or just the rock structures though. Lot of rocks.
---
For sure. If they had the same strength I'd give it to Dick though, he's got some pretty impressive feats in the comics. When it comes to hand to hand combat SKILLS Batman and Nightwing are top teir. Doesn't mean they stand a chance when you against people who can throw busses.
---

---
Why can't everyone just do their own thing? The casuals can be casual, min maxers can min max, we don't all have to enforce our preferences upon each other, the World of Warcraft is for everyone.

If you don't like how someone wants to play, just don't play with them. 
---
Don't need to take it personally when someone wants to play the game differently from you, whether that's being super laid back or super sweatsicles-try-hardington

What's wrong with 10 hour plus fights?  Back then I could join WSG or AB, wait in a long queue to get stomped by a premade in 10 mins. Or I could join AV and be in PVP for hours and hours with no break.

Running away from 10 people you mean.

Not being able to see the end results of your contribution isn't satisfying though. This isn't about honor rewards or whatever, it's about being able to experience the ending to something you worked towards.
---
Except you can use this one to improve your weapon skills.
---
This is why it sucks. Nobody who i into pvp even remotely likes AV. It is a place to go feel like you are in a big battle when you are actually doing more pve than pvp. 
---
If it wasn't for the rewards, which are way better than they should be, nobody would ever step foot in AV.

Nice man! Going to use this!!

Of course it’s out there. Always going to be as long as it is around (which will be forever).

So glad that my Wife is looking forward to Classic as much as I am. We started playing WoW together in 2006 and the game has been one of the few constants in our lives. Between us and two of our kids, we've probably spent thousands of hours in Azeroth. I don't want to work out how much money we've spent in subscriptions...
---
AV is my jam. Deal with it.

People posting shit like this are 100x more cancer than streamers, it's not like he is the one making these videos.. and what exactly has he done to you? This anti-streamer shit is making this subreddit almost unbearable recently, streamers such as Asmongold have played a massive part in even getting us classic.
---
Guys, just so you know OP is a troll account created so he can get attention from Asmon on stream. You see them regularly in his chat, "Hey Asmon check reddit/forums/youtube they are hating on you LMAO". They are pretty obvious so just downvote and move on.

Africa has gotten a lot of help from other countries in the past half-century, but you're absolutely right it's brutal over there.

Whether it's the civil wars or hunger (usually caused by a seizure of food by a regime involved in the civil wars) a lot of people die there unnecessarily, so you're right it is similar. 
---
Can't really think about it too much, because what can I do?

Arguing over semantics is objectively bad.

Yeah I'd agree with that!

first you wrote it's unique to private servers then argued it had to do with terms of service, now you're acknowledging that of course it happens. Idk man
---
Here comes the nerf bat to mages already.
---
I think the main issues are:
---
 1) if a turtle is triggered even a little, it often becomes a big turtle that means slow game with low honor. So it's either a 20 minute game or a 4-8 hour game.
---
And 2) there isn't as much side stuff to do as other versions of AV.
---
The first one deals with a problem AV has struggled with for years, that being the skewed incentive to either win as fast as possible or lose as fast as possible. It's like when people were making arena teams to lose on purpose, just a misguided incentive.
---
The second one comes in when there's a long turtle. People want other things besides just being stuck in an impassible problem. They want tactical choices, options, variety. Having a front line fight in a narrow canyon for 6 hours is not variety.

You don’t level as healer. Any healing class can heal any instance leveling to 60, just have a questing gear and keep a +int/+sp or +healing set in your bags. Even at 60 an off spec healer should be fine if they have ok gear, to do level 60 instance.
---
Shammy and pally’s buff DPS the most. Again both Shammy &amp; Pally can hold their own against most classes or have enough survivability to make it to help or escape. You’d need to have a bit of a hybrid spec, to kill a DPSer who jumps you, like an ele/resto spec, otherwise you just kite them and make a break for it.

There are a lot of differing opinions on how to stance dance.
---
a lot of people will suggest you make macros to automatically switch stances before use ability from another stance because it's simply more convenient(which it is), other people think you should manually shift stances because you have a better mechanical feel for what stance you're in and what abilities you have available.
---
 Personally, I like to do it manually. I feel like having all my abilities and stance shifts individually mapped to muscle memory makes me more able to adapt, and have a more complete understanding of my class rather than "i need to interrupt, i need to hit my interrupt macro button". If I need to shift battle stance-&gt;charge-&gt;hamstring-&gt;zerker stance-&gt; whirlwind-&gt;defensive stance-&gt;disarm, then I'm not just hitting a series of macros, I'm shifting in my brain from battle to zerker to defensive. And I can guarantee that doing it manually will make you a better player, especially in PvP. 
---
I don't think there's any problem with having macros if you already know your shifts back to front, but don't expect it to win you fights. This might be an answer for a very specific playstyle but I hope it gives you an insight!
---
With a good warrior and the right professions jump runs are well worth the time.
---
Lol tell me more about myself I didn’t knew
---
I am really sorry for you. Stay strong.
---
Yea it's fun when the worst faction balanced BG is even more imbalanced.
---
They look like sexual offenders that never got through adulthood. That's why I play one
---
Infested by ghosts, demons and spiders.
---
It really is. There is no bigger disconnect between people who have played vanilla more recently and those who haven't than attitude on AV. 
---
Then you have people who pretend it needs to be on some magical patch that makes everything fun. That never existed, AV was always shit
---
I was just thinking about this last night; I'd like to be able to play from the couch sometimes I think, or when I'm not at home but can get an internet connection. Laptops are definitely not ideal, but they can be nice, sometimes...
---
No, it just looks like Cielos managed to publish something very similar before d3ath.
---
No resources in vanilla dude.
---
quality.
---
When DPSing you will rarely stance dance, as it depletes rage, but when tanking you will do it to avoid being feared.
---
Damn ... it´s the DVD version ot he game ;/
---
Dam it! Have 3 kids. Stupid rules.
---
In the grand scheme of things the era of vanilla WoW for me was by far the best time of my life. 14-16, lots of friends, did well in school, was pretty physically fit and healthy.
---
Lifes been a shit chute since.
---
He isn't wrong though. Vanilla isn't harder. Anyone that's familiar with the Pserver community should be well aware of this.
---
The hardest part of Vanilla was getting 40 people together and have them all perform at least averagely. You fast forward 15 years with all the knowledge, strats and experience gaming we've acquired since and Vanilla content becomes nothing more but a tedious "joke" of content.
---
A boss turning one player into a bomb or having to hide behind a couple chunks of Ice aren't mechanic's that throw people off anymore, we deal with harder fights in 5 man's now.
---
Pservers have shown that with players in 2019, Vanilla content isn't that hard, hence why offspecs and Fury warrior tanks are so popular now, players are smarter and better in general.
---
No one's saying players that want to min max are bad, it's just NOT needed in Vanilla anymore unless you plan on speed running or getting world firsts. All the power to them.
---
Again, the point I took away from this is that the majority of players who aren't in that elite minority shouldn't stress about NEEDING to be optimal or else they won't raid/experience content.
---
Yeah, you tell him!
---
I think he means IRL deaths.
---
Bruh...
---
I'm sure we won't need BIS gear to beat bosses but having it over NEHunter5629 probably gets you a raid spot.
---
Lol true. All those sub level 10 guys are gone with 1 arcane explosion. Sad..
---
People used to do this back in the day. There's even a deadzone guide from TBC that makes mention of it https://web.archive.org/web/20080319141926/http://tkasomething.com/deadzone.php
---
Savory deviate is the best way as it's reliable and only has a 10s cooldown iirc. Consuming the fish takes a gcd but removing the buff does not.
---
It certainly makes Tauren Hunters more interesting as they are the only race of hunter that can actively manipulate their deadzone.
---
A lot of people are sleeping on it because private servers simply never coded tauren hitboxes to be blizzlike. That being said, orc stun resist is still very strong and it's a good pick out of the box. As Tauren you have to go out if your way to always have a stack of deviates on hand to be a competitive pick. For most people it's not worth the effort.
---
This currently isn’t the case on beta
---
looks tasty
---
Idk though if they will intentionally reimplement this zg „thing“ again since it basically killed all of the population until removed. I’d love to see what players would do now though. These videos from back in the day were hilarious to watch.
---
Combo points persisting after a target dies was added after Vanilla.
---
32.33, repeating of course, percentage.
---
Mmm no Dan but its also 3 letters, coincidence? I think not!
---
you can urge blizzard to make whatever changes to bfa. adios
---
Listen. You're not considering that for many of us, "tryharding" is actually pretty fun. Actually achieving grander goals is fun. I'm not dissing those who want to play casually or take a long time with stuff, but that's not the game for me, and just like I don't go around telling casuals that they must be hardcore I expect the opposite to be true as well where casuals don't come and demand I stop caring.
---
There is a huge difference, Dps added to raid from debuff is a huge difference...
---
I think adding zones that are lower level quest hubs with similar quest density to current zones it could be a lot of fun for leveling alts and stuff.
---
Combat daggers is one of the optimal rogue specs.
---
The race is on
---
*hundreds of thousands
---
There's no difference in the rotation.  The enh shaman isn't worth bringing either way.
---
Yes, I do.
---
so we should make warriors casters? that deters people. it makes hunters have to think and react.
---
"staybadists"
---
I'm gonna lol when the elitists steam roll through the content in 2-3 weeks or less and are bored out of their minds having MC on farm while getting their timegated 1-2 drops per boss distributed among 40 people. Classic is a social game. If you want to be a l33t MLG gamer Mythic Raiding is waiting for you over at BFA.
---
I got that reference.
---
You could use the same Rank 1-14 and Titles. Perhaps the gear could look different. Having new titles could be cool too.
---
I dont mind taking enchanting while leveling just to dispose of greens.  I sell those mats on the Ah and they sell pretty well.  But i never do anything more than Disenchant with it.  It just doesnt provide enough benefit.
---
My argument is the exact same one every time. 
---
You continue to rely on the appeal to authority fallacy. You’ve replied like 6 times without even addressing it so I’m putting you exactly where you should be: onto my block list. 
---
Later.
---
Nah the only shit thing here is your attitude buddy. People enjoy different aspects of the game for different reasons.
---
For veterans old and new, I imagine this might be old news, but there are a ton of people out there who aren't familiar with this talent system so I figured I'd do a hands on approach to teaching it.  Having played a lot of WoW and other MMO's/RPG's I'm used to optimizing and min/maxing, but I know a lot of other people aren't and they may not be practiced in this sort of "logic" I guess.  Either way, hope this helps :D
---
Never said I wanted any change in BFA, I want change in classic. I urged blizzard to remove it in classic and they can keep it in BFA and do whatever they want in retail. I urge you to reread it so you comprehend it before making a petty comment
---
Thanks! That's a useful link.
---
Yeah, orc is still probably better but it's cool to have something unexpected in your pocket and makes Tauren slightly more viable.
---
Also curious that Draenei female had a smaller hitbox while not even gnomes had it. Didn't know that.
---
I’m not oblivious to the fact that people are shitty everywhere you go. I work with racists irl. It is unique to WoW pservers when you compare them to actual WoW servers.
---
To say “welcome to your first multiplayer game.” Is dumb. My first mmo, and most of the ones after that didn’t have rampant racism or physical threats. WoW pservers are where it first appeared in my play experience, and that was after years of playing on UO pservers. I don’t play f2play games though I wouldn’t see it from those. Sure in today’s day and age of F2P multiplayer games it’s a lot more common to see.
---
It is however unique to those not something that is in every mmo.
---
I think he was saying that.
---
Yeah a sub optimal spec can work of course. But the point is if a person played equally as skillfully on an optimal spec, the whole raid would be better for it. 
---
Now I’m not trying to be an elitist. I just think this sub (and the classic forums) underestimate the raiding difficulty in classic. When doing *progression* I want to be in a guild where everyone is fully committed. That means specced optimally and geared appropriately. Once everything is on farm, sure I’ll tank as arms so I can PVP. But during progression, hell no.
---
If we look at the Shaman elemental/resto (30/0/21) and the Druid feral/resto (0/30/21) specs we can see where Blizzard did surprisingly well designing hybrid classes. Both specs are viable for pve and pvp content. As feral resto you can go from tanking to dps to healing all in the same fight and in many cases is one of the best class/specs to stop a wipe with. Elemental restoration brings little in the way of sustained dps, but it has great burst in pvp and great healing output in pve. You can stack shamans, but really you only need/want one Druid as feral/resto.
---
Same, always manual here. Once I got an MMO mouse with 12 buttons I just macros each stance to 3 buttons and press them with my thumb.
---
Because so smooth after that. Great for Druid's shapeshifting too.
---
Ah sweet victory for me.
---
Fuckin yikers.
---
  -Pink Ward
---
Why is everyone bringing up naxx like it’s the first and only raid? You’re literally ignoring all the content up to that point just for arguments sake.
---
100% true.  
---
Even clearing ZG in blues when everyone is in a sub optimal (e.g. pvp spec) is really fucking hard.
---
No worries dude I've gotten way worse for way less. I should have been clearer I was making fun of the no changes crowd not legitimately saying the add-on was a bad idea.
---
Hope you kept the receipt on that one lol
---
No, it’s further out and a disadvantage for tauren hunters.

---
It's been a long time but I feel like C'thun took us two months to master. Especially considering that original run back. Fucking brutal.
---
Ok, champ. That's why the people in the beta are already shitting on it.
---
I'm fully aware that you want the change implemented in classic. what I'm telling you is that you can urge blizzard to make this change to bfa and play bfa instead
---
you could probably kill a few bosses if you were completely immortal with dots and wand within a reasonable timeframe.
---
Bruh difference is nightfall debuff for 15% added caster dps... and cost to build it is not cheap
---
&gt; Because it's still possible to find a simple solution that the developers haven't considered.
---
Its rare for that to happen on big issues.
---
With layering for example, we know almost nothing about the technical aspects of their system. I am sure our simple solutions have been considered, but there are problems implementing them.
---
We are just blindly coming up with ideas and hoping they will work with factors we know nothing about.
---
Its almost like the metrics of how they measure High-Low accounts for actual “live” numbers and the amount of people in the closed beta is “low” by said standards. 
---
Weird.
---
You’re delusional dude. Classic raiding will not be vanilla raiding. We know what we’re doing and have been raiding private servers with overtuned boss stats for years. You have no clue what you’re talking about and letting nostalgia grab you by the balls.
---
After maining a gnome mage since TBC all the way to BFA I can safely say that Mage is the dogs bollocks. However i can also safely say that after a while you'll get fed up of looking at a gnome, I was just too stubborn to do a race change.
---
WoW is an open world game. Horde vs Alliance battling across Azeroth defending their lands. Warsong Gulch is a game of capture the flag/hide and seek. I understand why battlegrounds were added to WoW, but why did they have to dominate the Honor System. World PvP becomes trivial due to how the Honor gains worked from battlegrounds.
---
Blizzard should have kept ranking up in World PvP viable. The honor gains you earn from kills are so low compared to turning Battleground marks. Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin aren't as memorable as some try to pretend here. We've had them on live for 15 years. 1.12 AV is also just a rushfest.
---
Who's the female?

There's a weekly thread for posts like these in the sidebar. Please follow the rules.

I don’t think I’ve ever understood a metaphor less than this. I’m stoked for classic and am glad it’s getting beta tested. I wouldn’t want to watch necromancers working out the kinks of rezzing my dad.
---
That makes actually 0 sense sorry you’re braindead
---
They are keeping it for classic
---
I've always wondered... how did a group of Stonemasons build a large ship and the largest cannons on the planet?
---
This isn't true.  
---
Content, if you don't outgear it, requires your spec to be at least decent in pve.
---
This is the point that people miss when they say "Just Google it, it takes 5 seconds"
---
Maybe I already did my initial homework and am curious to discuss with an actual Warrior player or ask some direct questions.
---
It's Reddit, this is literally a place to converse about topics.

Is the range zone also far out?

What is melee leeway?

I actually think modern retail is better than this version. At least in that version you can PvP until you win.
---
Sign me up for some wacky itemisation ideas and/or lore
---
&gt; When doing progression  I want to be in a guild where everyone is fully committed.
---
True, I forgot about the people who would come to raid and leave every 10mins for smoke breaks, or keep their mics on while their GF or wife is yelling at them. I'm now remembering the more shitty players I had to deal with in Vanilla, it happened less on Pservers.
---
I'm honestly happy I didn't get a beta invite. 
---
All these players are going to burn out by the end of August.
---
I had two subbed retail accounts, no beta invite. I let my 2nd sub run out but will keep the one for my main account going.
---
Fucking duh...  You said it was boring.  That's the point I am addressing.  The fact that it's boring has nothing to do with nightfall.  That's all enhancement shamans can do.
---
If you didn’t know you dad, and wow raised you, maybe it works better. Anyways the point isn’t similarity of comparison, but the relationship you have to the game. Not everyone has a healthy relationship to WoW. Some people it brings great anxiety to not be able to participate, and I can’t really stop them from posting their dissatisfaction. Their pain is real to them and should be respected enough to not call them out for it.
---
Most people don't have much fun failing on content.

There will be PLENTY if time to set up your UI while you auto run halfway across the map somewhere for a quest, wait for a FP or Zeppelin etc.
---
You don't need your UI fully set up for level 1.
---
Anything close to... Europe? :)
---
Definitely not as profitable in a vacuum, but it won't be a sink if you aren't focusing purely on getting gadgets for your self. Especially on pvp servers when grenades above iron actually get bought at markup.
---
Also for hunter, making your own ammo and grenades is helpful on the wallet even for pure pve.
---
Pvp is definitely where engi is at it's best, but FD jumper cables is a great way to build rapport in a guild. Just generally having all the utility tools of engie keeps you relevant after your dps start to fall of due to scaling.
---
Invites-&gt;gear-&gt;solofarm MD.
---
That's why I'm doing what I'm doing, but if you want to farm your gold directly from profs you do you.
---
Basically, when you are standing still and fighting, the melee range is x yards (let’s say 3 yards for example). However, when one player is running away from another, the melee range extends to a larger range so the melee can continue hitting. However, this is extremely bad because in Classic one of the biggest mechanics to PvP is being able to kite your melee opponent because they do so much damage.
---
It's *hideous*!
---
On the private server I play on with the same 1.12 version of AV as Classic, games are 45mins to 3 hrs long. Usually the people defending include the R12/R13s pushing for rank. I'm not worried about AV turning into 15min games on Classic.
---
I think people who want optimization won't play alterac. It's the worst bg to get honor. People who farm rep will stop playing after they get exalted, so they also won't play alterac.
---
He is not kidding, if you think he is I doubt you even watch the stream
---
It sounds like you're arguing a good point about a different idea. It sounds like John was talking more about player predictions and explanations of what blizz does and why, and you're talking more about players arguing the merits of those decisions.
---
Also, the irony of people in the community arguing about what he is saying here, arguing about people arguing about other people, and being wrong about things we can't know, is hilarious to me. Happy to be a part of it 😂
---
I’m keeping this saved so that I can explain to recruits why our guild is going Horde.
---
Except two SEPERATE servers can simultaneously be High and Medium while this one is only Low when the other two are closed?  Use your brain, buddy.
---
I guarantee you, there is harassment in every mmo. make your last response if you will, but I'm done
---
You jest, but look at Colonel Kurzen (Colonel Kurtz/Mr. Kurtz, Vietnam/Africa). It's all about that journey into the jungle, baby. Heart of Darkness. Wakka wakka wakka wakka (not Fozzy).  
---
I love WoW because every zone is absolutely saturated not just with specific references, but with archetypes. Feelings of zones. It's packed to the gills with 'references' that are really sort of 'themes' instead, like how Duskwood is so Gothic... strange transformations of men in the moonlight who uncovered great evil, a mad hermit doctor run off, dark riders in the nighttime, a night's watch holding the land's last glimmering lights in their hands, tragic lives cut short and souls chained to the mortal realm.
---
Lmao
---
Yeah I withdraw my support of said cake.
---
You don't agree because you are emotionally attached to your feelings.  You "feel" right even though you were not in the room where it happened.
---
John is right.  Many of you on the forums were beyond nasty and stuck to your opinions even though they were 100% wrong.  You still stick to them now.
---
You long to be in the room where it happened but you were too busy consuming.  Your love for consuming blinded you from giving back.  It blinds you even now.  Blizzard was solving problems for the whole game... not Azzmo's problems.  Get over your feelings and admit you are wrong to yourself.  You failed and that's okay.  You weren't in the room where it happened and you weren't meant to be.  Just live with that.
---
Can someone link the Kermit “IMA KEEP IT REAL WITH U CHIEF!!” meme please.
---
Dude, world pvp aint a thing, and ain't never gonna be a thing.  Fuck Tarren mill.
---
&gt;It’s not true to Classic
---
Yes it is.  The implementation might not be correct, but there was range leeway (not just melee) in vanilla.
---
Not only was it there, but it has to be there.  Just stop and think for a moment about client/server synchronisation ... Are you really proposing no leeway?
---
I was hoping Blizz would use wow classic as a way to relive the vanilla experience with an improved/more balanced game. Rereleasing it with broken specs that will never be able to keep up without gobs of consumables seems wrong to me. #FixOomkins
---
Do you do something cheeky or something serious?

---
Why would you say something so ridiculous. He has been a huge positive force for Classic.
---
His philosophies about how Classic should be implemented are identical to the hardcore vanilla community's. He propagates these ideas to BfA players or non-WoW players, attracting a much wider audience who are all down with concepts like #nochanges. He makes the game seem very fun and exciting while making BfA appear like the opposite.
---
Maybe he wasn't a huge driving force early on like Sodapoppin or the private server crew but he did bring Esfand, Tipsout, Staysafe, many important vanilla enthusiasts into the spotlight.
---
Basically your thesis is shit and you should feel ashamed.
---
&gt; the pop increased rapidly all throughout vanilla though, there was never a point during vanillas lifespan where the pop was not increasing.
---
Overall pop increased, but there were definitely shrinking servers. 
---
A few big guilds would transfer off a small server and suddenly raiding or AV became very difficult, which would snowball into all the other guilds transferring off. The only people left would be old casuals and new players who didn't know any better.
---
Pm me. I wont tell. I promise.
---
Zuglife
---
This is how it was 14 years ago though
---
I played classic since the game released, and I always hated AV.
---
You have 2 versions. 1 where it is has way too much PVE and both teams just fuck around in field of strife, and 1 where teams avoid each other and race to the end. Both suck from a pvp standpoint.
---
Your last sentence shows exactly how little experience you have past BWL
---
Respectful and attentive people generally fail less than the average min-maxer.
---
For Narnia!
---
Not proposing no leeway, of course synchronizing client and server is needed, but at its current implementation, the leeway is gross.
---
It feels too much like their similarly forced spell-batching.
---
Im not Reading that essay
---
yeah it's tough, i'm very introverted too.  When I get into 'social mode' i can seem extroverted and sociable but it takes time to get into that mode, and it's very taxing.  I've trained myself up over time though and i'm better at it these days.  i can get into social mode easier and it's not as tiring, and i enjoy it more
---
if you're keen on meeting some more women i have two tips for you:
---
- join a meetup group or 3.  I'm a metal fan so i joined a rock+metal one in my city.  most people don't really share my taste in music but I met a lot through it and they're mostly good folk.  I've made a bunch of friends and had a few dates from within the meetups too - and going out with these friends enables meeting more women ofc
---
- go out to eat more.  I rarely get attention from girls and i'm hopeless at 'cold approaching' them in bars and stuff, but when there's a cute waitress I somehow get really good at flirting and joking around, and I've had them ask ME for my number which literally never happens otherwise.  Waitresses just seem more willing to actually talk and joke around, whereas girls in a bar or club are extremely defensive.  I know waitresses often do it for tips but here in the UK we have proper minimum wage and looking for tips isn't really much of a thing compared to the US so normally its honest conversation
---
and also check out Corey Wayne on youtube, he made me realise so many things i was doing that were just wrong and dumb when it came to women and the early stages of dating.  I put a few of his ideas into practice and the difference it made was unreal
---
i think where a lot of people go wrong is that we get into this mindset where things become set in some kind of pathway to the future.  it's like "right she's cute, i need to charm her then ask her out, then have the perfect date, then do XYZ and then we'll get married and..."
---
but in reality we have to stop thinking and act instead.  enjoy what happens in the moment rather than worrying about trying to move things to a certain destination
---
I see a lot more of "if you don't do max dps then you are useless" than this.
---
Bro you are retarded as fuck.
---
I’ve raided private servers and know how difficult it was to field 40 people who aren’t incompetent or can coordinate their schedules with the rest of the people in the guild.
---
There’s nothing delusional about first hand experience with having bads who can’t perform on fights. Clearing content is easy, consistently clearing content quickly while maintaining a roster of people who are geared, available at appropriate times, and are competent is another.
---
It’s actually going to be hilarious to watch guild after guild implode and be devoured by better guilds because they don’t set strict enough guidelines about meme specs and consumables.
---
Yeah that's what you think, and it's correct for most content, but that's *not* what OP thinks. There is really no saving this quote:
---
You can try all you want to warp this into something it's not, but this sentence is just not ambiguous in the slightest. Whatever your own personal opinions, OP is straight up telling people how to play.
---
But vael makes meme builds optimal. Balance druid, elemental shaman, shadow priest with infinite mana? Those things can compete with everything.
---
I haven't been in an AV that has lasted less than 2-3 hours... And I've done 4 so far. I think far more of them are lasting longer than 2 hours than don't.

Lok’delar is great for smacking poorly geared warriors that get into melee range early on :)
---

---
Lol hard packed snowballs make alliance imbalanced? You realize you can’t spam them right? It’s a memey fun thing to do when you’re bored of playing seriously
---
There is nothing as "one of the optimal". There is 1 optimal spec, the one with biggest number, all the rest are viable.

According to Metzen, Uldum was actually a post-modern re-interpretation of early Christian settlers in thr Americas. He goes into more detail on the zone’s design in this interview from 2016: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
I am going with cheeky this time.
---
For me it's a complex relationship which the name is dictated from the class.  I already have the name for my warrior alt but I haven't decided on my main first world problems.
---
Loud complaining helps less than constructive criticism.
---
I still question the attention it gets.. it's going to be much less impactful than people think. And there might be simple safeguards they can put in place to at least bandaid some issues. 
---
Like a cooldown on layer switching in STV around chest spawn times. Along with fixing the existing bugs, layering won't practically affect things very much
---
You can see in the first video the mage has full consumes on and uses ZHC, in the C'thun video he has no consumes at all and doesn't use his trinket when he's hitting for \~1200.
---
Makes perfect sense that with 300+ extra spell power he would hit for \~300 more.
---
Yeah, you're not the brightest; thanks for the confirmation
---
During Vanilla i went Ench on my priest with tailoring already and i was so broke, i didnt get my lvl 40 mount until i was 42 and i had to borrow money to afford it. You need that vendor price of those greens and quest rewards.
---
That being said, if you intend to dps or pvp it would be easier/cost efficient to just go BS
---
Also since there are no ring enchants until later expacs there is no reason to go into ench, especially early game, the bonuses are minor at best. And the cost is massive.
---
You can take it for disenchanting stuff in instances but I wouldn't level it seriously until late game when you can go back and farm effectively.
---
It's how the game was though. It would be class-breaking if it wasn't there.
---
You're an idiot.
---
I know that you can use @mouseover(not sure if that's the correct way to type it), but I don't know if that works on the minimap with track

I usually use a character from video games I liked. Or I do a mix of two things in RL I like.

I dunno, like, if you like Nutella and Toast you could name your character Toatella.

Welcome to the dead zone huntard!
---
There is huge problems incentivising people at 60 whit gear and in small groups to kill levelling ppl. Yes I know factions and the contention between them is a big part of classic but you basically shut down levelling for all the slower players and all players that level alts. If you add a separate honorststem to wpvp you won't get big battles (hilsbrand vs southshore) they are not efficient enuf and ppl will always seek out the most efficient way.
---
This is a great question. I'm really hoping it's in the dungeon companion I just bought.
---
I've never seen that.
---
I have seen, on the other hand, "LOL VANILLA IS EZ YOU DON'T NEED OPTIMAL SPECS LOL UR JUST ELITIST LOL MINMAXER MINMAXER!!!" if you point out that ret paladins are awful DPS.

If I saw that thing coming at me in a battleground, I would actually leave.
---
Why would they be anything else than pink? I dont get it?
---
2H Fury didnt get introduced until BC???
---
Seriously. Can we have a repost rule? A lot of other subreddits have one.
---
Always grind a little in between questing. As a general rule I grind for half the amount of mobs a kill quest requires and sometimes i grind close to lvl up before handing in a big quest.
---
That happens to me on pservers, yeah. I'll be out questing and just get random whispers from people asking me to heal dungeons.
---
I mean, watching the videos it really doesn't seem the same in the old as in the new ones.
---
There was a blue post made last night... they did this to make it easier to uninstall.... 
---
Really is simply bad timing on their end. They know how people were gonna react to this, they get bugged every day by hundreds of people for beta access. they should have done it sooner AND told people ahead of time or waited til the next stress test in a week to make this change.
---
Its does help tbh, I started wow in tbc so I'm familiar with the talent trees but I was like 12, so i didn't really consider what they did.
---
They are the best at being a furry.
---
Why do you assume they are overtuned exactly? And there is a lot of things you can do on private servers that wont be possible in actual classic.
---
Eh, we have different mindsets about it then. I don't blame WoW, they have agency and ruined their own lives.
---
This is not true anymore.
---
NA Horde reporting.
---
Wizard of Oz tattoo?
---
Just looked at your post history.. Surprised you know any words besides Twitch emotes.
---
Fight the power
---
Actually you can't, or at least you shouldn't. In PvP, when both targets are the same level, it acts like you have maximum weapon skill. I'm pretty sure that's how it works.
---
Actually triggered
---
I really don't get how anyone thinks AV lasting days is a good thing. That shit was changed for a reason, and I'm glad Blizzard understands it.
---
I really don't want to have to spend days just to get the AV xbow, because people have bad memories and think they will enjoy that shit. I remember being in those games, and everyone agreed that they sucked. That's why Blizzard changed it, and they changed it for the better.
---
Looking at the comparison videos it looks different in the new vs old. If it's the same then yeh it should stay, if it's different it should be reduced to be like before. That's it.
---
Agreed. But most people don't see it that way.
---
Nice trolling. If it’s real please cover up!
---
Cool! Worth a shot thanks!
---
I loved Vael back then because it was the first hurdle that separated shitty guilds from good guilds.
---
Lol.
---
Warrior/ Druid 2v2 in TBC the first season of Arena.....
---
Unless you're a really good rogue mage.... you lose
---
You can try your best and at the same time play a spec you find fun, those 2 are not mutually exclusive.
---
You can be a ret paladin, not the best choice, but if you are willing to farm all the consumables that makes you a good dps, why should that be something bad?
---
Half life 3 confirmed.
---
I don’t have them handy, but there are multiple informed posts by very experienced players that melee leeway is grossly different. Simply searching up the keywords will give you the results
---
I remember distinctly not liking it, when friends wanted to do it, I used it as farming time. AB on the other hand...
---
Zealand in Denmark has a maximum elevation of about 150 meters while Zeeland in the Netherlands have a maximum elevation of about 50 meters. Both places are still hilariously flat.
---
I could see where it would get old after a while, but it's so useful!
---
It's a long way of saying #nochanges.
---
Oh absolutely but it's because WoW exists.
---
Damn that a bad tattoo man. You should sue the retard that put that on you.
---
"Don't be fooled by the rocks that I've got!"
---
The set bonuses for shaman and druid all seem completely useless.
---
i usually end up in the second string of people since I don't do wow for a living. This leaves me with the vast majority of wow population to destroy :-)
---
Yes, of course she will.
---
Priests in holy speed are definitely do the best dps by themselves, followed by druid, as they can just kitty kill.
---
Exactly. And it doesn't feel epic joining the same one 20 hours later with 39 people who weren't even there the last time you were in.
---
Did anyone actually want the nerfef version of AV? i know i didnt.
---
100'000 viewers means nothing really?
---
You fucking moron.
---
Oh, definitely. Sometimes it makes people feel special to get a whisper, too.
---
I still remember the first time I was whispered to heal a dungeon; I was level 15, was asked to come to WC, didn't know shit about the game and was definitely not capable of healing as I was too broke to buy appropriate skill ranks. I was so ashamed of my poor performance (even though nobody yelled at me) I didn't heal again until Wrath. :(
---
But it felt good to get invited!!
---
? They just act like little fucking spoiled brats. Why does it always have to be some cringy comment "WHERE DID THEY TOUCH U". Parents don't teach their kids any damn respect. 
---
Sure, in Vanilla gaming was still toxic, but it was never even close to people now a days. The ones who act like "lul it's always been like that, it'z da internet" have no idea what they are talking about. It hasn't. The most that would happen is someone ganking someone and telling them they suck, alt F4 uninstall. Not wishing cancer, making fun of autism, and joking about school shootings.
---
Talking PvP wise, is you want a mage on alli, thats the only option. Humans may have some use of the stealth detection, but that's it. Gnomes are superior to them. Undead cannibalise can save your ass on bgs and 20sec (?) fear immune even  has more situational use vs priest, warrs and locks. Plus some minor shadow res maybe. Trolls berserk is op af and the movement hindering reduction  one is good too (not that hihg reduction) but u will be snared a lot. I know this might sound bs for most, but believe it, even these minor racials can mean you can jump away from that melee swing..
---
My main has been called splifzilla for 8 years.
---
It's the best BG for honor by a gigiantic margin when you get 10 minute games, which is possible.
---
Combat daggers is an optimal spec because both combat daggers and combat swords compete for the top pve damage spec.  
---
It's one of the optimal specs for that reason, and because you aren't in control of what drops you get.  A combat dagger rogue with the best gear will shit on a combat sword rogue with even slightly inferior gear.
---
Buy paper plates, plastic silverware, paper cups,  paper towels, and an extra roll of garbage bags. Sam’s Club and/or Costco should have enough for $30 to get you through two weeks of doing as few dishes as possible. 
---
Something I learned from similar “I’m taking to kids to my parent for the weekend “. I got major husband points for having all the dishes done!!
---
What, they want a Disney wedding or a beach wedding?
---
Was the tattoo gun made from a PlayStation 2 dual shock controller?
---
Is that a thing though? Aside from the starter zones (1-20) I never found entire zones overrun in vanilla, but I also didn't play straight at launch.
---
Bruh none is arguing about it being boring lol teh fuck lol, again you wasting time arguing every guild will be run differently
---
Alliance just wants to win. Horde are actually testing various things like Blizzard asked everyone to do.
---
The beta version isnt the version people who liked AV wanted. 1.12 is barely different from retail except for reinforcements. The lengthy battles were in versions prior to that.
---
Have fun with Vael.
---
I had this on the regular beta server, best was that when I used Feign Death I just completely disappeared.
---
Yes. Just like ragnaros dropping tier 2 legs.
---
I did something similar with a warlock I made, was quite fitting too. The fallout 3 DLC point look out had this creepy ass quest line involving a creepy ass evil demon book called the Krivbeknih. So hence the warlock was named krivbeknih
---
I had a similar issue, wherein I was stuck as a wisp in AV and couldn't rez at the gy or my corpse, and then when the game ended I was a ghost in SW- which was especially weird, seeing as how I was a night elf and should have been a wisp.
---
Its almost like they have the ability to change metrics for measuring pops in their own servers. And it’s beta. And you’re reaching.
---
Ah yes, the early Christian settlers famously worhsipped Anubis and built Pyramids and ofcourse today that territory is a desert. 
---
After doing some research I feel ashamed for forgetting this from my history classes.
---
Human brudda
---
So, combat daggers and combat sword both makes exactly the SAME dps? because if you is 1100 and the other one is 1200, and you choose the 1100, you are gimping yourself and not being optimal.
---
&gt;because you aren't in control of what drops you get
---
Using this reasoning I could say prot paladin is the optimal spec if you only got tank gear as a paladin, it makes 0 sense
---
A) melee leeway doesn’t effect your deadline versus melee at all
---
B I would expect someone who’s so concerned about “class-breaking” mechanics to at least know what melee range is and how much leeway is adding
---
I think also if we were in the world of very high quality video uploads around the time of the earliest Alterac Valley and there was enough content out there Blizzard could remake the map by eyeballing it, but I did a quick search for when youtube was launched and it was Feb 2005, and it took a long time before we got to a great standard of video.  
---
I remember exporting a video in high quality was a pretty long procedure on even a good PC plus compression on the website and old codecs ect.  
---
I only really remember watching anything of really good quality on "wow movies" towards the end of Classic, everything before that was grainy-vision.  
---
Or even better if WoW printed new CD's as patches came out (obviously a bad buisness idea, let users use their download to get patches is way better) If we had some CD's with the AV patch already in it it might be easy as pie.
---
Exactly what I thought, lol - only when he looked and realized did he fall.
---
It is hard to keep enchanting at a current level while levelling maybe if you get your friends/guildis to funnel you there non weapon greens for current enchants. It will still cost you a pretty penny just buying the low level recipes. Luckily you don't need the 90 gold for a mount at 40 as a paladin. As for a second profession go tailoring for extra greens or go skinning/mining and level a alt to level 5 you can funnel all mats and craft up to level 225 to de or use on your main
---
Assume? They are proven to be overtuned, as states by the developers of the servers themselves and you can cross reference it with boss stats from classic as well as old vanilla videos. Please understand what you’re talking about before you start vomiting BS
---
So, that's not how metrics work.
---
Creepyyyy!
---
I cleared everything up to four horsemen, which is when I quit the game entirely. I don't really care if that isn't enough experience for you or you don't believe me.
---
Great argument, nice points. 
---
You’re clearly 12 so you weren’t alive when vanilla was out. Sit down kid
---
I had an email off blizzard saying my voice matters and theh need help. Was just a stupid survey of live lol
---
Nice video! You should do these throughout Classic/Cata. Def love classic Menethil Harbor 100x more than Cata’s Swamp Land attraction.
---
Oof! Roll horde, say the tattoo is ironic.
---
Might want to learn what an elitist is. God I hate uneducated people.
---
Did in myself, can confirm it was an amazing thing.
---
You just need a hunter friend or be a hunter yourself. 
---
Paladin can work as well but hunter is better.
---
It was brighter before I nuked my graphics settings down and turned off sunshafts.
---
Can confirm.  If you get perditions blade while waiting on a sword upgrade from Dal Rends, you should probably just pick it up and respec daggers.  This is how I did a lot of raids until CTS/Maladath
---
Good burst. bad sustain.
---
The different button is logging out lol
---
&gt;So when i remember how much fun i had in these marathon matches in early AV i remember wrong
---
I played in those games, and I hated those long pointless battles as did everyone I played with. This whole "I loved the long AV battles" is something new that you would never see back then
---
Why watch streamers play the beta instead of waiting a few short months to play it yourself? Ruins the hype IMO.
---
To make it worthwhile you have to do an unreasonable amount of prep and actually follow through with your plan.
---
IMO it's simply respect. If you have 39 players who have done everything they can to bring the most possible to the raid, to get it done smoother and faster, and then you have the guy who just hit 60, has no gear, but is crying because 'they wont let me into the raid', you have someone who is playing the game for themselves and doesn't give a fuck about anyone but themselves.
---
Classic was built on Legion client. It wasn't a thing until BfA sadly. They may add it later but no word yet.
---
&gt;yeah it's tough, i'm very introverted too.  When I get into 'social mode' i can seem extroverted and sociable but it takes time to get into that mode, and it's very taxing.  I've trained myself up over time though and i'm better at it these days.  i can get into social mode easier and it's not as tiring, and i enjoy it more
---
I thought I was the only one. That's my biggest problem is I can't just engage social mode until I'm comfortable around people which takes time.
---
&gt;but in reality we have to stop thinking and act instead.  enjoy what happens in the moment rather than worrying about trying to move things to a certain destination
---
This is all too real.
---
I can never talk to strangers because I'm constantly running different scenarios through my mind. It's downright pathological.
---
I heard on some stream that on the beta you are not able to feign death to trap etc in combat anymore? Is there any truth to that and if so is it a bug and will it get fixed? D:
---
Hulk + Thor &gt; Superman. The rest are irrelevant.
---
He's not talking about titan's grip. This is litterraly playing fury with only one 2h weapon.
---
Hunters only topped meters early in vanilla.  By Naxx, even in top guilds, hunters couldn't compete.
---
Looks like someone hasn't played Vanilla since 2006. THE GAME IS RADICALLY DIFFERENT NOW, DEAL WITH IT.
---
That’s part of the problem, thinking raids are the means to an end, and you’re “stuck” spending time with those people. 
---
If you wanted a quick, easy, anti-social experience, go do LFR on retail.
---
If you're offended by that joke, then it just makes what I said true, doesn't it?
---
I'm actually disappointed it has so few upvotes. I thought it was gold, Jerry, gold!
---
That's worrying! I hope you submitted a bug report :)
---
Yeah, you're a wimp. 
---
It's a war between factions and you get mad that the opposing factions kill you....
---
PvP is never usually fair..... that's what makes it great
---
I'm of the opinion that nodes/fish shouldn't spawn in AV.
---
Kill it with fire!
---
Not what patchwerk data says.
---
&gt;the goal is to make your intentions clear but not be creepy.
---
My brain is going to need a new firmware update for this to happen.
---
Your comment is truly ironic. You see, I don’t have to try hard. I log into the game and don’t complain about a damn thing because it’s a fucking game and Vanilla is competitive in so many ways that other games or not. Continue being a sheep my friend.
---
Do you use a standing desk and an ergonomic mat in front of it because your butt hurts so bad when you sit down?
---
Tbh the talent trees were the best thing, so many ways to change your play style, cheesy stuffs, it was one of the things I missed the most (respec cost tho :x)
---
awesome interview. Metzen just seems like an all around great guy
---
&gt; it’s a boring job that none wants to do,
---
Or, you know, you could play the game because it's fun. I love AV as a battleground when people actually play the map and don't basetrade. Tug-of-Wars are my jam, and I'm even a warrior main.
---
I don't think that's true at all, and in my experience players who are committed to raiding (i.e. playing raid worthy specs) generally are far more attentive and responsive.
---
I'm with you. Everything I've read points to Warriors being the only viable tank for end game. This guy is having delusions of grandeur.
---
Don't queue for AV if you don't want long fights, dude. AB and WSG exist for a reason.
---
I'm okay with anything that fucks hunters.
---
I'm sorry but unfortunately not, those classes will underperform against the pure dps classes even with infinite mana. If you want to bring those, they will shine with their utility, never their damage
---
I dunno man, I was in a pretty average guild and we beat cthun. Most only logged into raid, usually just shy of 40 people so we'd pickup people from other guilds or go with 38 or 39 and hope someone was just gonna logging late. Or a lot of the time we didn't have enough and don't go. But that was fine. It was an easy going guild. Probably why we ran out of time to try naxx before the expansion.
---
I think all you "rude awakening" peeps are in for a surprise with how easy the content actually is. You have years and years worth of people soloing this stuff for transmog, or because the never did the content originally. You have sooooo many resources to research fights nowdays. And the simple fact that people are going to be better at the game then they were back then. I'm 100% confident straight pugs could finish all of classics endgame.
---
Sweet! 1080p? How high do you have your settings?
---
Gods, i was strong then.
---
I thought I read they ended up updating to a BfA client? Maybe I am wrong on that.
---
Im just going to dl pserver and practise settings and ui so i can do it quick between downtime
---
OEB drops in MC, will be phase 1. Not sure what you’re confusing it with.
---
It's unfortunate that it's possible.
---
Hunter deadzone has been shown to be larger in Beta than it was in Vanilla by 3 additional meters. Minimum range for auto-shot is currently 11 meters, not 8 meters.
---
Even with infinite mana you still don't do good dps.
---
I’ve raided a lot, I’ve raided with years long friends and with people I barely knew. Chain wiping or waiting on afkers or having one person be not “with it” is not fun and makes a terrible time for everyone. Unless you’re in the most casual of casual guilds, most people invest time into the game to progress their character.
---
I know what it means,  to think you are better than someone else.  Which is exactly how he is taking in that last sentence
---
Yes, you should try. But a lot of us who played during vanilla and had essentially unlimited time to give the game no longer do. We have families, jobs, chores and other real obligations that won't allow us hours to do the prep required to raid optimally several times a week.
---
Obviously everything maxed. 1080p but Resolution Scale at 150% (=1620p)
---
Alliance SCUM!
---
Hence why I said some guilds hand of rag as carrot on a stick to get people to do it...
---
I was raised near the salt flats by Salt Lake City. My salt levels know no bounds
---
True but Vael is literally a DPS test and without a certain number of min maxers that boy can destroy you easy. You can carry some folks of course but as a holy Paladin I hate to see a Ret get carried and also get my pvp gear when I’m filling the role i should be. 
---
Not that I get super upset about it but it is what it is and if the Ret is a cool dude and shows up to raids ready and what not then I’ll certainly be less irritated.
---
It was such a good “remake”
---
We do want AV but we want the actual vanilla version with pvpve 
---
Where rushing was impossible and winning was meaningful
---
beach wedding.  thankfully it wasnt windy because i was wearing a kilt
---
That has nothing to do with melee leeway, and it was always like that. Hunter deadzone accounts for the size of hitboxes.
---
r/FBIOpenUp
---
&gt;thinking raids are the means to an end, and you’re “stuck” spending time
---
Not sure how you're reading that from his post. Project harder.
---
Wanting people to put in effort and pull their weight =/= "quick easy antisocial experience".
---
There's a weekly thread for this in the sidebar.
---
Really? Thanks I’ll check it out
---
I heard Sludge Den is based on Detroit
---
Because it's "fun."
---
Right, because it's SOOO hard to find one of the shaman that wants to play dps.
---
Happy B-day bud! Go out there and smack those warriors!
---
Yes, it is streamer material, but you are just presenting and editing more for information. I think the issue would be if you are advocating for someone. If anything, a few that are very popular look like schmucks in some clips.
---
&gt; You can absolutely clear MC/Ony and even BWL without people having consumes and enchants.
---
But it will be so much harder than if you did have those things.
---
You can absolutely clear MC/Ony/BWL with 20 ret paladins. Doesn't mean you should do that.
---
Gotta be careful man. You'll anger the neckbeards.
---
No you couldn't say prot paladin is the optimal spec because a) they compete with prot warriors for gear and b) even at much much higher gear levels they still aren't nearly as viable as prot warriors in terms of threat or durability. 
---
Combat Swords and Combat Daggers don't compete for weapons at least, and letting daggers rot so you can use your swords from ZG or BWL is just handicapping yourself and your raid.  
---
Aside from that, people disagree on which spec does more damage in practice vs on paper.  But both are so close that you can consider both optimal, because if no one goes for combat daggers you will have a sub-optimal raid anyway because gear will literally go to waste.
---
Thats awesome! Just curious, as a comparison, do you use the same settings for retail? If you play that is. And if so, do you get similar Fps?
---
It was always possible. People do it on servers with pre nerf AV.
---
Not only is it possible, but because the bonus honor comes from PvE and not PvP it actively encourages you to outright ignore the other faction in order to maximise your honor gain.
---
You get massive honor even on a loss doing this and it doesn't even matter of you lose all the time because you compete for ranks with your own faction not the enemy faction.
---
i know the feeling!  alcohol definitely helps haha.  The good thing with meetup is that it makes it easy and 'predefined' for socially anxious types - you dont have to worry about approaching people, or what to say, or being rejected.  You see the group, you walk over, you say "hi, are you guys here for the meetup?  my name is..." and after that it takes care of itself
---
and yeah, analysis paralysis has been one of my weaknesses.  I'm trying to train myself to be a little more impulsive and 'in the moment' but as soon as I get distracted I default back to being overly analytical.  It's difficult but everyone has their weak spot!  I have friends who are too far the other way and are too impulsive and it gets them into trouble
---
This is awesome bravo!
---
You're not understanding the reference, move along
---
I used to be a streamer hater but then I deiced to give it a try, and I be damned, it's really fun to watch.
---
Ok, I'll just miss out on BIS items and take every 4th week off if I want to rank up in pvp.
---
How about AV have no honor or rep rewards, then we have a deal.
---
No he doesn't.
---
There are still vanilla vael kills online and you're welcome to try and find a raid comp with any of those specs actualy being used, let alone take any of the top damage spots.
---
BiggusDickus
---
&gt; protip: all the classes cookie cutter specs are actually dogshit for most raiding
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0
---
Yeah that’s kinda what I feared. I went on a few 2-week-long backpacking expeditions in Boy Scouts where you actually carry your own gear and food (although you picked up food at predetermined locations so you only really carried like 2-3 days worth at a time). My father and I were looking at doing Kilimanjaro at one point and from what we read and from what you described, it sounds like I probably had more strenuous climbs at Philmont. But still, I’m sure the experience was like no other.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Yeah and I’m sure your raid was full of meme specs that’s just “showed up” - you’re being intentionally delusional or you’re full of shit.
---
Out of curiosity, which encounter is that? Meme specs can be useful at times, but at least in my opinion, they can never be godlike. Holy paladin can have the same if not better utility, and there's no encounter where paladin does better dps than pure damage classes
---
It's entirely weapon gated. If im not mistaken for MC gear, perditions blade + core hound tooth makes combat daggers the highest dps spec until deep BWL.
---
But we are not equal to streamers in the eyes of a company. You pay $15 a month but streamers are publicity and generate more interest in your game which brings in more than your $15. Who really cares if they are given a chance to reserve their name. The one they use to work for their job. Does it really matter if you don't get to play a character named Asmongold?
---
14 years ago there was a “dead zone” where, as a hunter, your target was A) Too close to shoot at, and B) Too far away to be in melee range. This is different from “melee leeway” which allows an opponent or mob chasing a player to still hit the player from a greater distance than typical melee range. 
---
While melee leeway was part of the mechanic back then, kiting was also an essential part of a hunters toolkit. If what they are saying is true, that the leeway range is larger now, then it should be addressed and resolved. 
---
I have not played since Cat so I have no idea what it’s like in retail or if kiting is even a thing anymore. However, since hunters don’t weapon swap during combat in retail and Classic is based in part on BFA a different leeway is possible.
---
lol sure
---
Probably Africa actually
---
I haven't played Retail in a while but I remember my FPS were always kinda shitty. I remember in Legion that fyling over Suramar with Drawdistance maxed always tanked FPS hard. 
---
You really can't compare Retail to Classic since Classic looks definitely way way worse, since all Assets are obviously from 2004.
---
&gt;	Chain wiping or waiting on afkers or having one person be not “with it” is not fun and makes a terrible time for everyone.
---
That’s a far removed take from forcing your Hunter to melee the boss with Nightfall, or requiring everyone to be flasked and fully consumed each pull.
---
Classic already has a relatively niche crowd. The number of people who will want to do classic twice is much much lower. Possibly enough to warrant a very small(like 1 of each type) fresh batch of servers 4-5 years down the line but they would lose the vast majority of the classic player base if they dont figure out something at the end of classic.
---
Go play Fortnite or something if you want instant rewards. Jesus. Relax and enjoy the game because you enjoy it, not because it's a chore.
---
Ok but i'm saying that I don't think it's fun when you don't get to see the end result of what you do.
---
Sneaking in as a druid and cycloning (?the immune/stun thing) the tank was amazing! Drek would start a killingspree on the healers/dps healers would die tank would die then literally everyone else. I once even recaptured our gy before doing it, stopping the attack alltogether. That was probably my greatest wow achievement ever.
---
IIRC, vanilla does not allow traps in combat, but feign death is allowed in combat. 
---
Feign death also pulls you out of combat, allowing you to place a trap if you’re quick. Macros are your best friend for this. I can’t think of a single time out of combat you’d want to feign death.
---
Wasn't it the community that called them hybrid classes?
---
I mean, in a game as gear-driven as WoW there is no such thing as a "hybrid class" really. You pick one role and stick with it.
---
I know it was always possible. I just wish people didn't do it.
---
You spent 11 talent points on essentially getting 3% hit on a class which hitcap is 9%.
---
Please no
---
Have fun @ vael without any fire resistance gear and buffs.
---
Some private servers did, the good ones, which are pretty much every vanilla server since Nost, have drop rates which seem to be nerfed. Not that less items drop, but the good ones are much rarer. Then again we don't know for sure because only Blizzard holds those cards. I do know though that getting Black Ash Robe 2/3 kills for a year definitely isn't Blizzlike. There are also some inconsistencies on weapon drops as they are exceedingly rare. I've seen more Thunderfuries being made than maladaths and CTS combined. 
---
So I don't think private server guys will be in for a negative here. One thing that will change though is that you can't just bribe a GM for drops as has happened on pretty much all of the private servers, including the one I play on. It's become so common that I don't even give a shit anymore. 
---
Yeah I'm looking forwards to Classic.
---
"That cake isn't viable"
---
Dude..
---
Your personal dps is a total joke.   The only thing you care about is uptime of nightfall.
---
That's fair. I just like seeing my HK tally go up and I love silly tugofwar battles, so longer AVs are great for me.
---
Doesn't mean his an entertainer. Most likely it means he's showing something new, special/rare or extraordinary. Doesn't make the person asmo entertainining
---
Yeah spend months levelling and getting pre bis and consumables and another few months raiding for a transmog? Lol its also master looted so you would have to be the guild leader and run the raid
---
Then why are you caring about crits at all? If you're gonna be a debuff support spec, at least be the best support you can be: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/AATPDTPdAjDx
---
Yeah, I've had people ninja invite me and I'm always put off. If someone whispers and actually asks me, if I have time I'll usually help, but if you're just going to lazily throw out invites I'm not interested.
---
For people who can't sit for long periods of time:
---
* sit/stand desk if you can afford it
---
* get up and stretch and move around regularly. I'd suggest for your marathon playtimes, set some alarms to remind yourself to straighten your shoulders. If you set a whole song alarm on your phone, you could use the duration of the song to stretch!!
---
* maybe a nice cushion to sit on (like this  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014F18ZGU/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014F18ZGU/)  or check their other types for something catered more toward what you need)
---
To prevent or help with repetitive motion injury:
---
* stay hydrated; it'll help prevent inflamed tendons and things like that! You can also drink a ginger tea to help with this if you have any issues with tendinitis or arthritis!
---
* Do exactly as I suggest in the second tip above and take regular breaks to stretch your fingers/hands/arms/shoulders. Get up, move around, touch your toes, whatever. Using a song for your phone alarm is a great way to time this out.
---
* Make sure your keyboard/mouse/monitor/etc are at the proper heights for you to avoid pain. Put your monitor on a phone book if you have to, get a side-clamp for your mic, lower your chair... This definitely isn't about looking cool; it's about preventing injury to yourself. It might sound silly to some people now, but it isn't worth getting hurt.
---
* If your tendons do get a little inflamed (you experience a "burning" in your thumb, by your elbow, or in your forearm in particular), you can encourage good bloodflow by wearing a wrist brace overnight. This is mostly for people who curl up their hands while they're sleeping (which can cut off blood flow) or anyone experiencing numbness in their fingers (carpal tunnel) but it's way more useful in the beginning stages than it is when it's too late. Typically you can find these with knee braces and stuff at WalMart; don't be cheap and get trash ones.
---
   * You can also use ice. Ice is good for tendinitis, heat is good for arthritis. Protip: don't get both because everything will suck, and do NOT over-ice. Just 30-40 seconds on and off two or three times every couple of hours. Those soft gel ice packs are pretty good for this and they even make some for your fingers!
---
   * Take a break if you need to, have someone gently massage your fingers/wrist/forearm/elbow, epsom salt bath, etc. 
---
And lastly:
---
* **DO NOT OVER-MEDICATE!!!** I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. I've had chronic tendinitis for a decade and arthritis on top of that, and I was told by a doctor to take ibuprofen "as long as it didn't upset my stomach." Naturally by the time it did upset my stomach, I was ruined. I have chronic pain I can't medicate for anymore. :') Go for my above suggestion of hydration and ginger tea + stretching for some preventative maintenance. Your body will thank you!!
---
Hope this helps someone. :)
---
I don't mind if it's easier than vanilla and harder than optimal. It would be boring to one-shot every raid boss and not have a decent challenge every now and then.
---
I'm also not arguing that you shouldn't enchant your gear a little and bring the basic consumables. Just saying that there's really no reason to worry about it unless you're speedrunning or server firsting.
---
&gt;But what they don't seem to understand about classic is as long as you show up to the raid on time you're fine.
---
Uh, no. DPS/heal metric add-ons exist for a reason. That reason is knowing where to put the blame when the raid fails.
---
If you want to lol around in a for-fun build, do it alone. No one is going to buy your "for fun" explanation when the raid wipes and everyone loses two hours of their time.
---
What's the hitcap on Nightfall?
---
Must... punt... it.....
---
You say your totems is important but you skipped on imp WF totems?
---
Just because raids are harder on retail with more mechanics doesn’t mean it’s overall harder than classic wow. There are so many more aspects of classic that makes it harder than retail.
---
Because crit increases flurry uptime, which increase nightfall uptime.  Improved weapon totems is overrated.
---
It wasn't full of meme specs, and I haven't implied it was. If you take issue with something I said please quote it directly.
---
The people you are telling to wait 6-8 weeks to play bc of layering are telling you to wait just a couple days for players to spread out so there isn’t layering.
---
Also, I would 100% take a hunter player who can activate their brain and start kiting mobs that run through the raid instead of a braindead warrior who just stands there not taunting.
---
I don't want any version of AV. 
---
For large battles, it sucks. More about fighting npcs than the other team, and this becomes even more true in older versions. If I want a large battle. Pre bg tareen mill vs southshore or. BlackRock mountain are more fun and are purely pvp. Also, we can actually organize ourselves without being forced into a random group of 40
---
Really, I can't understand why anyone who actually is into pvp would enjoy any version of AV. Maybe if I only played solo, never pvp'd, but liked the idea of being around pvp? Idk
---
Totally overrated.  Adds very little dps.
---
Yeah, I just wasn't sure how the two compared in terms of output performance, since parts of it are modernized. From what you and the other folks are saying, it seems like my nephew should be run Classic relatively decent, even if he has to dial down the settings.
---
I like to call this "spot the guy who started playing a year after release".
---
I think someone said that blizz said it was 8%.
---
Awesome dungeon questing resource, thanks!
---
Waiting for Reforged
---
Were the hunters scamming the meters?  A tactic a few infamous hunters used back in vanilla was to name their pet the same name as them.  This confused some of the meters of the time and drastically increased their listed damage.
---
Do you have links to these patchwerk meters?
---
15yearsaslave
---
The take away from this thread is, everyone is amazing at this game and killed KT during vanilla.     Also they were all grand marshall, Forgot to add that.
---
It's a festering abomination...
---
Just kidding gnomes are cute &lt;3.
---
Kinda ironic that you are playing the class with the lowest nightfall uptime possible and so worried about your nightfall uptime.
---
A normal person in this sub. A rarity.
---
fishing for spell crits with that sick baseline spell crit chance
---
ele dev is such a trap talent
---
Keep the kids, you can use them to farm while you sleep
---
Is analysis paralysis an actual thing?
---
Aka the logout button
---
...how did you draw that conclusion?
---
Imagine an AV premade vs premade. I have never done that.
---
Exactly this
---
To be fair, the people that get annoyed are because they get spammed for invites constantly. I’ve never played a warrior(I’m sure they get messaged the most to tank) but as a class that can heal, on large private server launches I would constantly get messages every 5-10 minutes. 
---
I never really got annoyed because I do it myself and acknowledge that it’s the most efficient way to fill your group. In my experience, around 30% of potential healers or tanks don’t respond on big private server launches, because of the sheer amount of messages they’re receiving.
---
There's no pserver for the classic client.. beta is your only chance to do it ahead of time.
---
I prefer the exit game button. Works quicker.
---
Placeholder comment.  This sounds pretty great.
---
Maybe he is referencing [this](https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1683-Build-of-the-Month)  but I don’t know
---
I might do just that!
---
I too am shocked someone wants to discuss something on a discussion forum!!
---
Oh ok, all pservers shut down?
---
The main issue is that wiping in Classic *really* sucks. It takes 15-30 minutes to get everyone back up, possibly reclear trash and rebuff.
---
On top of that, the guy playing ret paladin is probably not a stubborn skilled player. Most of the time, he is just clueless. If I don't know someone well, I look at their class, gear and spec as a rough competence check.
---
You see a mistake, I see a toilet break.
---
who is talking about wotlk tho?
---
Oh I forgot about that.
---
Right?  Almost like enh shaman suck ass.
---
It was added in patch 1.4. That's Phase 2.
---
Alliance is imbalanced all the time in av.
---
... the op, the person who I quoted.
---
Well, an issue is that the Pservers don't have accurate info on boss' damage, resists, or armor and they all had vastly different numbers for miss and parry chances.  I know the Pservers had to buff bosses still and that the mechanics will be a joke at the end of the day, but they aren't perfectly comparable.  
---
That said, I do think most of MC will be cleared the moment 30 people reach level 60, with the only roadblock being rag because of fire resists, but even he'll probably go down in the first week.
---
Sweet thanks for the clarification.
---
Could be pretty huge. I’d use deviate instead though. It would make it a lot easier to fuck mages up.
---
 Nefarian,  Anub, Noth, basically any trash pull, UBRS and any lower dungeons. But with that being said you have to put in a lot more work and effort to make it work. You can just roll a rogue if you want to just look at the damage meter, but Ret you have more in your toolkit, you can DPS if you tryhard or you can heal if you want.
---
Better than anything else available.
---
yeah, i used to live in north wales so i have been up snowdon a lot.  when looking at the route plan for our 'more challenging' climb of Kili, it was almost exactly like doing snowdon for 6 days in a row, then down for a day and a half. 
---
Snowdon takes about 3 hours and isn't really challenging for anyone who is vaguely in shape.  The only difference is the altitude - you walk extreeeemely slowly on Kili so people don't get out of breath, so your days are like 6-8 hours usually
---
for the people that weren't as lucky as me with altitude i think it was quite tough.  my friend spent the whole first night puking (and in the morning we woke up to a disk of frozen sick haha) and he spent the next day digesting energy gels in his mouth because he couldn't eat.  He made it to the top but some people got to the final camp before summit and were ordered to stay there and wait for about 12 hours while the rest of us went up... that must have sucked so bad.
---
I would still recommend it for the experience though yeah, it's a breathtaking place.  The sunrises were unbelievable, the fun we had with the group was amazing, seeing planes flying at the height you were standing was very cool (and above the clouds especially!).  Definitely zero regrets about going!
---
Is it really a tall order to have a couple of hours for your hobby once a week?
---
So you like my idea of there being no AV rewards?
---
Since Classic is based off the BFA api couldn’t you set up your UI in BFA, using new mods for Classic, then copy the WTF folder over at release?
---
You're right, though the thread is based on OP saying that John's quote made him rethink layering so we're talking about how the quote was/can be perceived.
---
It happens now, what is your point?
---
I recall seeing this in a nightmare once
---
This battle took 6hrs+, during it we summoned all wind riders, as well as summoning Lok 3 times throughout the battle. The horde was pushed back to Ice blood GY several times, only to push back the the Alliance base, it was back and forth throughout the match. The horde only managed to win after a portion of the Alliance team didn't defend as we pushed.
---
"Extremely marginal" .  based off of what data?
---
Unfortunately people did, for days/weeks after they announced the version they were using. Hasn't changed anything yet.
---
So it extends the minimum range on ranged weapons as well? I was thinking you'd have a 7-yard melee range and so only a 1-yard dead zone between 7 and 8 yards.
---
I don’t disagree with the map imbalance, the snowballs are silly and seems like you might just want to whinge
---
wotlk had dungeon finder... so no just no
---
I was out of the loop when the beta started and was under the impression that it was just a weekend thing. I had no idea it would run indefinitely and they'd be raising the level cap. Maybe I'm totally off-base here but this seems like a hype-killing game plan.
---
Unless you're doing it for immersion or RP reasons, enchanting is much better leveled at 60.  There's 2 ways to efficiently level enchanting: Farming low level instances for greens/blues + tailoring and DEing the results, and buying greens on the AH for DE.  All of which is much easier to at 60.  DEing leveling greens and blues doesn't produce nearly enough material.
---
My first toon was a mage who did tailoring and enchanting and stopped doing enchanting around 45 or so because it was too fucking expensive and just focused on tailoring till 60.  Once at 60 I went back and fully leveled it up by farming cloth, tailoring it, DEing it and enchanting it or buying up cheap greens for DE.
---
If I had it to do over again, I'd have leveled up herb gathering sold that stuff at the AH until I had the gold for a full enchanting respec and then go from 1-300 enchanting in an hour.
---
Who’s claimed that was necessary? There’s a huge gap between what you’ve strawmanned out there and letting anyone in the raid meme spec
---
Drop some prism stones
---
No the private servers run a different client, so the classic wow client is incompatible with those addons.
---
Did you stop playing during vanilla? This is how AV was at the end of vanilla. This is 1.12, this is how it was then. Dont expect it to be any different in classic
---
Yeah, I want my rotation to be better so I can be more helpful and our raid can do better. Why do so many people on this sub care about people wanting to play better? I see so many posts like this one, like me optimizing is somehow hurting anyone else.
---
Bunch of city Floridians up in here. Come out and play here in green swamp and the vast, hick-filled emptiness between the 6 major cities and the beaches.
---
When people talk about alligators being a danger, it screams city. They're just like the tree lizards out here and only get bitey if you fuck with them, their nest, or have been fed by the fucking ~~tourists~~ idiots and lost their people fear
---
Know what rural floridaman is afraid of as he wades home in tea-colored water up to his scrot?
---
Boars man, fucking boars.
---
Suspend your FB or they might find you. Cover the windows any experienced addict. Put a "sick leave" auto message in your gmail.
---
No. That's not what elitism is. Case and point: you're ignorant and uneducated.
---
Thanks, I'm going to steel that now.
---
I know that im just going to practise setting it all up like in game settings and save ui for later, i should have elaborated
---
14 AV x 80 people = 1,120 people. That is packed? Less than 600 people per faction...is packed? My Vanilla server had roughly 1k concurrent players per faction...and it was categorized as "LOW POP".
---
To get to a low pop category, it should have been at least 25 AVs going in the same time.
---
The beta server needs MUCH MORE PEOPLE.
---
It should have 3-4 layers, each with around 3k players...not a single layer with a measly 1k players.
---
Blizzard needs at least an additional 10k beta testers, to properly test everything.
---
Yeah me and my buds are going to make a group to intentionally cause turtles
---
The optimal move is to have some of your rogues dagger and some of them sword, so you can split loot drops most efficiently. No other class is competing for dagger drops.
---
I don't like  streaming and never watch it.  I have better things to do in life.  But watching youtube content might be one of those better things.  However if the youtube clip is based on a stream, the editing must be REALLY good to convince me.   I will now check yours and return here to give my feedback.
---
Haha silly me
---
This, man. Broke my heart when I came back for MoP and they were gone. Even worse when I heard the reasoning was "well everyone plays cookie cutter anyway."
---
What about the anticipation of a talent point with each level? What about specs that got more viable with better gear, or further into raid tiers (Like Hemo Rogue with HWL's/MSA)? What about our precious meme builds??!
---
Pretty sure a good tanking pet could handle the add no problem. A beastmastery pet could probably handle all of the pack for a good amount of time.
---
i think its an "actual thing", not an *actual* thing haha.  it just means overthinking to the point where you psyche yourself out
---
like if you saw a girl you liked the look of and wanted to talk to, but you thought too much about what to say, how long to wait before asking her out, worrying about being rejected, worrying what people might think of you for approaching her - then you miss your window of opportunity
---
I usually go for something self-deprecating. People seem to feel less need to flame you, if you've already put that on the tin. 
---
Plus it seems especially fitting as I'll be playing feral lol.
---
Not sure if I want to commit to an mmo at the moment. Every week I feel differently about it haha
---
When it comes down to It, everybody is just having a tug-of-war battle. But in reality nobody will turtle and rush straight to vann and drak.
---
Since I create alts like crazy, I'm going to pick a general name and then put that every toons name.  Like ZugWar, ZugHunter, ZugIsn'tGayBecauseIWearAPrettyDressOnMyMage,IJustLikeLookingFablus.
---
He was being sarcastic. Of course it's Egypt-inspired.
---
Yes i wrote down the class/gender/race and name of my 8 classes, the AH character and the 9 bank alts (2accounts)
---
No, the Classic API is a mix between current and old API. They will not transfer.
---
Still a rough path seeing as felwood is like 47 to 57 or so .
---
Wolf is the best pet for raiding.
---
I can imagine guilds trying to project this attitude will have issues on launch trying to fill 40 raid spots unless they get top 3 on the realm. Speaking personally, I love optimizing the hell out of my playstyle but even that attitude is grating to be around all the time.
---
Yeah I figured this was the case of some sort, I played all through vanilla but didn't do much PVP, I stopped doing AV because it just took way too much time and I was more focused on PVE, on beta I noticed a lot of people complaining about how short and "un-epic" it was, so I don't think a lot of people realize this haha
---
Someone else just posted theirs that lasted over 6 hours...that’s pretty long for one battleground.
---
Yeah I too remember doing this back in the day.
---
what would you recommend the zone to be?
---
MeToo
---
Oh well, it was a thought, but...
---
i meant u would get banned :D
---
I was think maybe Reltihfloda
---
when the honor system was rolled out and people started grinding for rank 14. 24hour + AV's was not conducive to honor farming. Especially when the addon came out taht allowed people to queue up in droves. I remember being horde on chogall and mugthol pvp servers getting 38 of our people in out of 40.   
---
It was more beneficial for both sides to ignore each other as a whole and just DPS race the towers/boss to win or lose in 10 minutes or less. The fastest AV we ever did was around 8 minutes. this was around TBC expansion.
---
All the patch notes are available online. It’s actually really interesting to read just how many times they revamped classes. Sometimes they changed them so much they refunded everyone’s talents cause it was so different
---
Roll orc
---
ShoulderMcPads
---
&gt;  You can absolutely clear MC/Ony and even BWL without people having consumes and enchants. 
---
If someone doesn't care enough for enchants, they likely don't care about other aspects of raiding.
---
People who care enough to pick an optimal spec, properly enchant their gear and bring consumables will generally show up on time to raids, know what they should be doing and give the raid their full attention.
---
Forreal!  Talents were a HUGE factor into making levelling feel fun.  Plus, since there was such a good number of talents, you easily adapt a "meta" build.  I mostly raided on my frost mage, so I didn't really need cold snap, but I took it anyways because it's just too damn useful in other areas.  It feels like I have identity among the other mages, you know?
---
The fact that the expansion that "killed world Pvp" was far more successful than Vanilla, and the game kept on going for 10+ years with huge success without world pvp being a significant part of the game. 
---
If world pvp was important to a significant amount of the player base then WoW would've developed into a completely different game than it did.
---
I had a hat with hello written on it. Hellohat the shaman lasted me from vanilla until wrath when I transferred it to a makes acc (same surname).
---
I’m in the position you’ve just described. I have a full time job and soon to be 3 kids, my wife works as well. I raided pservers up until AQ last year and was able to balance out my life with raiding and prepping for raids. I wasn’t able to PvP like I wanted and couldn’t swing the 100g extra a week for respecs. I also sacrificed some sleep 2-3 nights a week. I would suggest playing casually and pvping or pugging MC/Ony if you don’t want to dedicate the time it takes,  because if you think people want to carry you you’re sadly mistaken. Any decent guild worth joining will be either loot council or some type of dkp that takes into account attendance and raid prep so unless you like raiding for weeks and weeks with no loot because you can’t prepare (or want to be handed epics without working for them) I would at least try to prepare somewhat.
---
Ill just use The LFG addon
---
Thanks... I hate it
---
Ghost mushrooms in Maraudon are among the more important ones.
---
Even with the new button does logging out not work anymore ?
---
Nail on the head!
---
it was 10 yards in vanilla.
---
Wolf does not appreciate not being fed for 6 hours
---
All the videos of bug had dwarf priest in it.
---
Honestly what you're talking about as difficult I have no recollection of being the case.
---
First, keep in mind, part of any equation is the positioning in a fight and this involves the tank.  Any half-decent tank is going to pull their target aside and face away from the group, *especially* if the target has any sort of cleave or AE.  In those situations you'd wait til the target is in position before sending in your pet.  If your tanks never did this and left cleave targets facing the group... you played with bad tanks.
---
Second, if a fight, be it dungeon or raid, had a mechanic that featured AE damage you simply learned the fight and pulled your pet away (just as melee would have likely done) before the mechanic goes off.  If your PC was so bad you were struggling with 5 fps then I can understand how that might have been asking a lot.  But that was an issue with your machine, not a fault in the class.  [Keep in mind when you started to get tier sets your pets had fairly high resists... they would have actually been better able to handle some AEs than melee in full BiS gear).
---
Personally I raided through almost everything in vanilla (killed C'thun and cleared 3/4 of Naxx).  I remember having my pet out on basically every fight.  I never used any sort of macros and just the basic commands of the default UI coupled to my own positioning.  It took a little bit of work but it was doable.  I pretty much had no choice.  Hunter dps was so low by the end of vanilla I needed every ounce of dps I could get.
---
If they're gonna spend effort on the lamp pots in westfall they might as well go all the way
---
Woah.... awesome. I'm in a hiring position myself, and have not come across anyone who has put guild leading on their resume or had it brought up in an interview. But your post here just blew my mind.  100000000% correct on every statement.  Shows a ton of maturity, and if someone said this to me in an interview the way you just said it here I'd probably be floored. 
---
BUT. 
---
I would have trouble believing them.  Especially before i started playing on private servers.  It would be tough for me to really know that they were in a competitive guild and actually acted like a leader. Short of putting a guild member as a reference or really diving into questions to poke holes in the story (which i dont think I'm qualified to do since I never raided -- i wouldn't even know how to ask questions to test the story) it could come off as a risky resume addition especially in certain industries.
---
False back in the day too you could alt f4 and when you get back in it will land you next flight path
---
The sprint animation does change at different ranks though, maybe that's what he was thinking

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKCUxRCILks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKCUxRCILks)   
---
This video shows the comparison.  
---
CHANGE THIS. I CANT PLAY A ROGUE LIKE THIS!!!!
---
good counterpoint to the OP’s suggestion here
---
My damage comes from the 60ap and 1 crit that the barbarous blade gives. It is a direct upgrade to my slot and it is my pre-raid bis. In fact I will keep the barbarous blade for much longer than the warrior would.
---
I see you have spent some talentpoints in  SlowFall 😂😂
---
I don't feel the need for them honestly.
---
flexing about vanilla content is really solid weirdflexbutok territory. The average player is so much better than the average player 15 years ago. Everyone is way more conditioned to basics, mechanics, everything. Some people will min/max because its fun (I will be one of them), some won't, but all of them will clear the content because it really is just that easy relative to retail. 
---
Ret pallys and boomkins are going to kill c'thun, its going to be ok. so many angry posts from people who "know better" from back in the day who are still angry 15 years later because their guild made them heal instead of play ret.
---
It boils down to "Do you know what you're supposed to do in this fight?"
---
&gt;Yes, ok great you will probably win.
---
&gt;No, not only have you died to something easily avoidable, but you also killed 39 other people.
---
If we can make our characters 3 days before launch, i’m sure this will give us access to the main screen where options can be accessed. So I’d bet you’ll have 3 days of prep.
---
He'll get better performance at the same settings compared to BFA.
---
I think a major disconnect here is that you and others like you have been doing that on private servers etc. I would not assume that that will be the standard level of experience across the majority of players. 
---
There will be plenty or more people who haven’t touched the game since it was current content, people who have never played vanilla in any form etc.
---
The mechanics are simpler but there’s a lot more to grind and progress your character and to get all 40 members to do that will be a challenge in itself. A lot won’t make it to 60, and a lot of 60s and guilds won’t clear as far as they think due to sheer organisational things.
---
Kinda by definition it is 
---
"a person having, thought to have, or professing superior intellect or talent, power, wealth, or membership in the upper echelons of society"
---
8 Minutes during TBC? That's nuts! Haha, yeah on beta people aren't too happy with it, lotsa complaints, maybe Blizzard will do something to make it more like the original if enough people complain? Who knows.
---
Thrall bless this Horde Warrior.
---
&gt;The hardest part about classic is having 40 people show up on time
---
If someone doesn't care enough to enchant his gear or spec properly, why would I trust him to show up on time to raids to each week?
---
You should make a raid to find out where that path leads, as it is clearly a mage only easter egg!!
---
Not every AV was an epic multi-hour tug of war match. 
---
Some were under an hour and every now and then you would get one that was up for several hours.
---
I used a wireless mouse, yes.
---
Keyboard I just used the laptop keyboard.
---
Not really any tips, but I’d suggest a rigid mousepad.
---
Personally I played with my mousepad on the couch, so I could kick my feet up and play.
---
A soft mousepad was terrible on the couch
---
It won’t be like that in classic sad to say
---
So, you made a post pretty much complaining about how short the AV was, but u didn't PvP much because it was too long. Got it
---
Maybe I was just unlucky, because I did multiple ones and each one was about an hour or less.
---
something something i don't like streamers reee
---
At least that balances out that faceroll class.
---
&gt;Warcraft player gets a call that a 12-year strike at his former favorite game "Classic WoW" ended, so he decides to return to work...
---
Shaman has a 20" range against you. Keep your distance and he has zero ways of closing the distance.
---
It's probably what the players want the most I guess, I just tought having a scarlet crusade patch right after the defeat of the scourge would make the most sense tho
---
If it was a 3% crit talent, would that be better?
---
This is perfect!
---
1 Boomkin with the mages.
---
I think just one more tier, like a tier 4, available at some point wouldn't be too bad. The problem is you can only add so much content and stay at lvl 60. Honestly I think events are the way to go. Maybe for epic mounts or cosmetic items and like 1 piece of BIS gear. Don't make it easy though. Make it something someone would have to put work into over the course of a couple months
---
I don't even see it getting to that point.  The instant a meme spec gets a piece of loot that would have been better on a spec that takes the game more seriously is going to cause drama.  Very few raid leaders are going to put up with otherwise easy to avoid drama.
---
This was more a "twice as many people are more interest in lvl 58 Vanilla dueals than Retail Arena" kind of post.
---
Its staying, cause you could do this in vanilla by logging in and out.
---
Does anyone ever die in these new Arena matches?
---
I don't like his spec, but let's not start throwing bad facts around. Shaman actually has the highest possible Nightfall uptime.
---
Paladin is the only class that has actually 0 ways to break your cheetah or close the distance. The matchup is so unfair for the paladins it's not even funny.
---
One ugly motherfucka
---
I'm going to tryhard the hell out of classic and will likely enter MC with quite a few bis slots, but I have no idea why I would be upset if a warlock in greens got epics. MC is a joke, classic raiding is a joke.
---
yes, of course
---
&gt;It’s actually going to be hilarious to watch guild after guild implode and be devoured by better guilds because they don’t set strict enough guidelines about meme specs and consumables.
---
Let's be real here though. If your guild falls apart it likely had nothing to do with the Retpala that always show up in time with world buffs and consumables and never fail to mechanics.
---
Well at the time, I was a kid, I didn't have a whole lot of time to play, so I avoided doing AV because I knew how long it was, but as an adult who has a bit more time to spare I was pumped for long matches!
---
Lol, not sure if this is a zing against me, but if so, it's fair. I should not have been in WC at 15. Then again, nobody else in my group should have been there either. I think my initial response to their whisper was something like, "I think you've got the wrong person!" :')
---
You're kind of rolling the dice when it comes to inviting people to your group whether they whisper you or you whisper them. You don't know the player; you can't tell if they have their spell ranks or if they know how to play their class/the role you need them for (particularly for tanks or healers).
---
I guess if a person is going to /w to get people to join for a particular reason, at least make sure they're level appropriate? lol
---
you gotta remember, this is 1.12 we're talking about now.  not 1.6.
---
What would you do instead of threats ?
---
Word
---
Vael will be killed by boomkins and rets in greens, why does this anger people so much?
---
Congrats I guess? Lmao 
---
Really shocked one of the most famous wow streamer on earth is beating some promotional tourney streamed by Blizz Lmao. 
---
I can't imagine why streamer communities are seen as toxic and ignorant, lmao.
---
I don’t see how shaman could beat out a hunters uptime
---
I'd love to see a gear set that would make paladins viable tanks. Like a 6 piece bonus that adds an ability that generates threat like sunder or something. This could a great way to add gear without making everyone super fucking powerful
---
I love the:
---
-"fuck you I'm dps"
---
-Bro its deadmines
---
I agree about not bringing underperformer on raid... altho the performance of 'support' people like the nightfall holder, token druid or ench shaman might be... weird to quantify.
---
However, I bet more guild will fold due to  loot drama with 8 rogue + 10 warrior fighting for thunderfury... or all caster rolling on cloth gear / all melee dps rolling on leather DPS gear.
---
Yeah obviously the patches would come with new prfoessions stuff and quest, I just didn't specify it, my post is only about the general ideas and stories I don't go into specific content
---
feed him, op
---
blease... he's so hungry
---
Server first on most private servers for Naxx is like 3-4 hours. No world buffs.
---
vanilla is EZ. doesn't mean a raid have to carry underperformers and meme spec around.
---
or.. vanilla could be hard if you have a raid full of Spriest, feral druid and ret paladin dps'ing.
---
Reminds me of the time we invited a "newbie mage" in blues to karazhan and just gave him the instructions of: stand where the other mage stands, do a /assist macro to target same as him, start/stop dpsing when he does.
---
You didn't level them to 60 on the first week of the server though. No group has ever done MC on week 1, because it's a mathematical impossibility. Some individuals here and there make it to 60 at the very end of week 1 if they barely sleep at all, but not enough to form a 40 man raid. And there is simply not enough time to get pre raid BiS within week 1 either.
---
I guess you will have to see once it comes, but I already know how it will end up.
---
Are you toxic and ignorant if you prefer Vanilla over Retail Arena?
---
oh I meant the people who will be commenting here, haha
---
Well I’d be lying if I said I’ve never been ganked
---
level 60 with a bit of gear will make an enormous difference
---
Well PLAYING PRECISELY in vanilla was just spamming 1 spell over and over again, sooo....
---
18 pts in elemental might be worth 9% crit, but you only get that 9% crit after a spell crit.  Your spell crit chance will be REALLY low.  Your chance of not getting a crit after 10 shocks is 0.95\^10 = 60%.  60%!!!   On average, only 1 shock in 20 crits!  Let's say you can cast 2 shocks per 10 seconds.  The buff is also 10 seconds.   2/20 \* 9% crit = 0.9% crit. 
---
You are spending 18 pts in elemental for 1% crit. 
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/AcAEw80z3QIw8Q](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/AcAEw80z3QIw8Q)
---
im well aware. and itll be like that on classic. but just like on private servers the average guilds will struggle hard in naxx
---
So does Sodapoppin retract his statement about people ganking streamers repeatedly? Or does it just ignore it because its Horde players doing it and it doesn't impact him.
---
You know the deserter debuff had some downsides too. It's ok for retail where every bg takes like 10 min. It should only be put on ab which is the only bg that has a max time.
---
Pretty average for 1.11 onward
---
The point is that 30,000 people watch WoW streaming rigtht now. The vast majority of those prefer to watch lvl 58 Vanilla pvp rather than Retail pvp.
---
Moltencore works, so does rivendare
---
I like to call this "spot the guy who still doesn't understand Classic will be on 1.12."
---
Yeah, on my server in the earlier stages of vanilla BGs, alliance BG options were as follows: wait in a 40 minute queue for WSG, where 90% chance you'd be facing one of two T2.5/3 geared premades, queue for AB that almost never happened (horde just didn't sign up for it), or get in AV when the horde queued for it on the weekends and kill a bunch of people.
---
But why would you do that? It's a completely dead raid spot. At least an enhancement shaman has totem twisting.
---
Sick dude. Thanks!
---
Vanilla IF &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Live SW
---
Hunter has tranq shot.
---
My uldum patch is shitty I don't really have any idea for it and just wanted to put it there but what don't you like about the undermine patch ? It's actually one of my favorite
---
Streamers aren't in the beta for testing.
---
Spoiler alert: you never saw anything other than a warrior tank in 2004, but in 2019 youre going to see prot pally tanks, warrior tanks (as arms or fury even), druid tanks, and potentially even the rare shaman meme tank. 
---
There will be fires mages in MC getting massive resists and terrible dps, and it doesn't even matter because the only thing you actually need them to do is decurse on a couple bosses. 
---
People have some THICK coke bottle nostalgia glasses on, but the reality is the average wow player in 2019 is going to destroy the content to the point that I think there are going to be a lot of disappointed people who are thinking there is going to be "progression" in PVE.
---
Not in melee range they don't.
---
I'll do something similar to this. Make a list of each name I'd like for each alt and just go down the list until one is available. Got plenty of time to come up with my lists!
---
The dream would be a two letter name... Never was able to snag one of those. :3
---
Very true. I think part of Blizzard making the beta AV 58 may have been to artificially increase the time it takes to complete the games.
---
I was saying this from the beginning — was even trying to ask asmongold in chat If he was ready to play AV for 3 days straight lol. The second I read the patch notes I knew it was going to be bad.
---
Pretty sure we don’t kill fishermen in war. I’m unarmed and low level
---
Ne hunter gonna be my farming character.  I dont see a problem with it.
---
Genius idea
---
Thank u, much appreciated 👍
---
&gt; I think all you "rude awakening" peeps are in for a surprise with how easy the content actually is.
---
ive done naxx 1st day of release on 2 different private servers, i know how easy it is for guilds taking it seriously.
---
the average guild who isnt using hundreds of gold in consumes and abusing good classes and world buffs wont clear naxx without considerable naxx gear.
---
the different between a stacked raid who knows EVERY fight before it comes out compared to a raid with meme specs, no consumes and learning 15 fights in a 5-6 hour raid week is just massive.
---
plenty of guilds on pservers dont even kill rag in their first few mc runs. on the most recent pserver 4 guilds killed cthun in first week out of 40 who killed 1 boss and logged it.
---
if you prepare its easy, if you dont its not and its a very long dungeon to learn every boss
---
What AV? I'm new to the game
---
30ms, I paused the video frame by frame to try and recreate it but couldn't , im sure its just getting the jump exactly right though
---
I only meant additional content, not replacing anything
---
Azshara has so few quests atm it's not a real leveling zone.
---
Pservers are wrong, all wrong. If you think they are accurate or over tuned you're insane.
---
I see. I think during leveling I should learn about manual switching then. After that at 60 I'll se if macroing is better
---
INSTANTLY i was like WTF the possibilities! then i spent 20 minutes missing the jump and logged off
---
Didn’t this system change at the end of wrath right before cata?
---
You can totally do enchanting and use it as a "gathering" profession vs. a crafting one. Nothing wrong with that!
---
You're gonna get pitch forked by people who are dumb as fuck and can't comprehend what you wrote, because you worded it pretty poorly. Should get to the point a bit better.
---
OP basically is saying hunters have a hard time kiting because melee hit distance is NOT correct when trying to kite. Melee are able to hit much farther, making it harder to kite. It also seems hunters deadzone is larger by having to be 11m away compared to 8. 
---
I'm not saying any of this is true, just trying to simplify his argument for the "NOCHANGEZ" crowd, because OP wants it to be exactly how classic was. I think.
---
they did a huge NPC nerf in 1.11 (so any prior version would be awesome). those NPC basically prevented a rush, but after 1.11 they are just a shadow of their former glory.
---
there was also a change in 1.8 where they removed the small raid boss that guarded the graveyard in the middle (that boss was added in 1.5 iirc).
---
Any version prior to 1.11 is the AV most people remember. any version post 1.11 is basically the boring, rushable AV we know today (but without the reinforcement stuff)
---
"Salutations!"
---
Lol I donno, watch this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqiU9NfdH-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqiU9NfdH-8)

---
its probably most peoples favorite, and i hope that discussion is not dead yet and me can maybe convince blizz to settle for a version prior the 1.11 npc nerf
---
Getting 40 people zoned in to the raid is going to be the hardest part of this whole experience. Nobody outside of a streamer group is going to have someone checking for enchants when you zone in. The extra DPS you are doing for having +7 int is nowhere close to annoyance of finding player #40 and getting them summoned to wherever you are at.
---
I told my girlfriend months ago - probably a month or two after we started dating - that I'd be taking 2 weeks off in August to play WoW and she was welcome to do whatever she'd like during that time because that time belongs to me. 
---
I'm taking her to Hawaii later this year anyway so it'll balance out, but she still seems to be OK with it since I told her it was all planned out long before we started dating.
---
A little bit yeah.  IIRC you had to manually pick a tree and then reach the bottom of it before you could put points in the other trees.  And other than having MORE talents, it was basically the same talent system.  The current talent system we have in retail came in at MoP, or the prepatch to MoP (not exactly sure, I was unsubbed at that point :/ )
---
Warriors, Hunters, and Paladins all have higher Uptime%.
---
I expect nearly every guild will make exceptions for strong players who can't prep. 
---
Regardless, your recommendation is my plan. I'm no longer in a place where I can or want to arrange my life around WoW.
---
May just be because of the high quantity of dwarf priests though.
---
Ultimate enhancement spec is the one that allows you to swing nightfall and only cast totems. Enhancement shaman are not a DPS class you are a support class if you are even brought to raids. My guild will be opting to bring an enhancement shaman to be one of our two twist sisters. The enhancement will be in the main tank group with our feral druid to better buff our two DW/Defiance tanks. So their entire purpose is to keep those two totem buffs up 100%. If they cant do that then they are not going to be going enhancement or will be wearing full healing gear and swinging nightfall so that they can twist to keep windfury and goa up for myself and my off tank.
---
\-Kyliemanogue Main Tank of &lt;Participation Totems&gt;
---
I agree completely, imaging warrior charge animation being completely different warriors would riot in the streets.
---
No
---
Cool. Fuck hunters.
---
I'm not the original person you disagreed with. Just pointing our the map is better for alliance.
---
Unless you get mauled by NPCs on your way there and die.
---
It’s in the beta!!
---
Depends
---
"pull their weight" omegalul. Im going to be trytharding on a holy pally, and if someone does 10% of my healing, 80% of my healing, or 150% of my healing, we are still going to clear the content. 
---
People trolling and taunting randomly to *try* and wipe the raid for the luls is going to be far more devastating than some boomie with no enchants.
---
23% spell crit gives you even odds of reproccing ele dev before it drops off.   Maybe that sounds like a lot, but ony buff for example gives +10% spell crit.
---
You really think you are going to start off DW tanking?  lol
---
This mindset is so retarded.  
---
The whole premise is no one knew anything about what they were doing in vanilla, but people can only say that because you can't go back in time and show that people actually were doing things like trying to optimize raids, dps rotations, and gear.  
---
This whole meme that all content will fall over as long as you have 40 people who aren't asleep is just straight ridiculous.  Remember too, that in vanilla we had macros that were more powerful than we will in classic.  
---
P.S. you will not see a prot pally doing any progression tanking.
---
I fail to see how that sentence is wrong or bashing anyone in any way or telling people how to play. You're reading way to into it.
---
"If you want a harder game you should stick to retail" isn't the same as "I'm telling you to go play retail". He made a valid point and then added on it by basically saying "If you're looking to be challenged in the games raids, retail is probably a better option for you"
---
That's factually correct except for the 0.001% of players that perfect to speedrun/world first.
---
You're literally latching onto the words "you should play" and tunnel visioning on it.
---
Then suggest that I can't read, well reading is just more than turning letters into words in your head, it's about reading a whole paragraph and taking it in, not a handful of words in it.
---
how? They have literally nothing unique about their kit other than flurry, a hunter warrior or paladin would have a higher nightfall uptime because they have actual abilities.
---
Move out for 2 secs and tranq? It's very well telegraphed when you need to tranq.

Well, I suppose, since she exists in all times moreso than anyone else
---
I don't know, he wasn't called deahtwing yet before cataclysm I think ? I'm not a lore expert
---
I see, I think I can get used to play as DPS and then maybe expand to Tank
---
Damn! Imagine if Blizzard actually added zones for levels like 20-30 or 35-45. That would be so cool. Would make u wanna level once more.
---
Hard agree ! Especially for the talent point each level, it gave you a sense of pride and accomplishment, I liked to think about my tree for each encounter and how I could make it better, post-cataclysm you had only 3 choices and it was spells/passives (also too easy to respec) it didn't felt rewarding and lost of personnalisation of your character.
---
And Stormstrike?
---
Hunter and Warrior using Nightfall is a completely dead raid spot.
---
That is literally what he said
---
All I'm asking for is the same thing everyone else gets for the same price.  Sounds like a fair deal to me.
---
Because people want this to happen atm, its fresh. But give it a few months on live,  groups will need to be farming quick and the zerg method will be the meta. Then the other faction will need to counter it with there own zerg.
---
other streamers did more to actually get classic.
---
his stream didnt start caring until classic was already announced.
---
Could be just exploration. "We've found some unexplored island, however our first exploration crew didnt return. Could you check it out?" Turns out the island is quite deadly and has some sweet treasure. Just some RPG things!

"Oh you want $40,000 in equity from the home that your two children currently reside in? Ok, but we're taking away $25,000 that your ex paid toward your student loans and credit card debt. Now you get $15,000."

But it really was that way for a long time.
---
Remember, this isn't classic wow. This is a classic wow full of no-life obessive ADHD-raddled kids used to love-wow, that miss the entire point of classic wow and, let's be honest, will ruin the pacing of the game, and then we'll all be SoL still missing the opportunity to experience classic wow.
---
Actually the idea was originally pitched as a MOBA BG. It didn’t turn out that well
---
You're the one extrapolating a minor essay from literally two sentences in a flamebait post. I'm not sure what your obsession with this is, but it's clear that you've made up your mind and I have no further interest in trying to explain to you how to read basic sentences.
---
I think the classic one looks better. Seems a much better pace to match the speed and sprint doesn’t look stupid...
---

---
Month and month\*
---
Nah, kids make a great excuse to work from home.
---
"Can't come in, kid is puking sick. I'm going to work from home today."
---
Win-win for me. If they do TBC progression servers, that'll be awesome. If they do this, that'll be awesome too.  
---
It's unfortunate that neither position is one I want to rEEEEEEE at because it makes me feel out of place on a WoW forum but them's the breaks.
---
I love enchanting. It's just fun. I farmed my ass off for Crusader and loved every second of it. I'll probably do it again on an alt because I just like doing it!
---
That said, if your goal is to get to 60 ASAP, I'd do skinning. It's a joke to level. Maybe on release it'll be harder (more competition), but you're a lot more likely to maintain it as you go and you can sell your goods on the AH, save them for an alt, or sell in bulk to a player for fair coin after you hoard it all in your bank.
---
You could try herbing/mining as your second profession, but you'll run into the issue pretty quickly of competition being too high to level it appropriately (as in, you'll end up lagging behind in levels to try and level the skill up, or you'll level into a zone where you can't mine/herb anything and you'll never catch up). Could make a little coin in the first few zones, though? Not worth it for me personally; I'll be trying to get to the cap and would rather not get distracted by nodes.
---
Once you hit 60 you can start enchanting by farming low leveled dungeons for greens/blues.
---
I don’t. It’s not even fast, it looks more realistic.
---
Goodluck with that.
---
Hey, you know it’s all made up and this is just a conversation for entertainment?
---
Fire Resist is really only mandatory on the tank, you can get away with minimal amounts on dps, it just puts more pressure on healers.
---
The request stop button is in the Classic Beta.
---
And they all played their own spec how they wanted! No one told them what to do.
---
He is playing a character
---
That ability which isn't used because of debuff slots?
---
Or, make melee leeway apply to the hunter's ranged attacks as well. If leeway can make him attack me from 10 yards away, I should be able to shoot him if he's inside 8 yards under the same circumstances.
---
Well as many stated here, I was pretty geared when I was applying to guilds (8/8 Shadowcraft, barman shanker, enchants, might even had devilsaur gear). I was pretty persistant, made contact with some officer and had thorough conversations about the class. Eventually I was invited to two guilds merging to one raid guild (both guild unexperienced) we became the #3 Horde guild on the server.
---
Nowadays, with prebis being a thing, it will be a little different. My best guess would be to gear up as good as possible but most of all try and get into some dungeon runs with members of a guild you want to join. Manners, knowledge and skill go a loooong way. And that is exactly how to prove it! I have not played pservers so it only a guess :).
---
Because this subreddit has a large population of "elitist casuals". It may seem an oxymoron, but these guys are absolutely militant when it comes to playstyles, trying to tell everyone that their casual way is the only right way to play the game.
---
druid?
---
&gt;I’m curious how much they’re gonna spend on marketing for classic.
---
I imagine they'll mostly rely on word of mouth/internet advertising. Buying TV space for a 15 year old game probably isn't the best route to go.
---
Thats what I get for skimming
---
PS the closest thing to progression raiding in vanilla is the people who are getting 40-50 together right now to optimize leveling and clear MC on the first week.
---
Why? Because it builds the hype IMO.
---
But /r/classicwow told me that repeatedly killing streamers will get you banned?
---
I used to do this so much back in vanilla for mage ports and warlock summons.  we would pay a warlock if they were in the zone to come help summon etc. if the warlock was close they were usually willing  
---
I dont think i've done /who in the last 10 years lol
---
No countdown on a flight path.
---
The only reason I liked AV was that it was a super easy honor farm and made for great PvP montages when you'd kite multiple players around the Field of Strife.
---
Resto is the only way to go.  You need totemic focus.   Getting hit capped isn't a total joke, like retail either.   Getting 9% hit without talents would likely mean wearing substandard items.  You can fix this by not doing that.  Instead of hit, wear some gear with crit.
---
You'd think so, but not really. I've leveled 4 different characters to between 25-35. I'm using this time to test every zone and character type both for myself and blizz. It's been pretty enjoyable aside from this weekend. I played a couple AV games and then positively knew I wasn't enjoying myself.
---
I dont think you are in the wrong at all. But you are assuming some things, and I think most people on this sub are tired of all the 'min maxing is not the only way to play' and 'most people will actually play casual, lol' posts that have popped up. We know. Everyone knows. Only people like to discuss min maxing and optimization in RPGs and since we cant play the game, we discuss it.

If anyone needs a group of friends to play with for Classic Wow, please add me! I have a large group of friends (many wow veterans), trying to make our own guild!

Yeah ninja cap relief hut while they are just starting the last boss is a really lucky / strong move. 
---
But cyclone wasn't in Vanilla.  Still fun tho =P
---
Yeah when he has 1000 people on he is a different person then when he has 20k. When he does a pod cast he is a lot more chill and normal. Most all streamers are an act, I view it like a radio show.

I played it for fun once I got my gear. There's people on this sub constantly talking about power leveling classic when it launches, reading speedrunning guides and whatnot. For me, why race to the top. Enjoy the journey. But I don't tell people how to have their fun. If that's how they want to do it, fine.

Shut the fuck up about the god damn streamers Jesus fucking christ. I'd rather play on a server with nothing but streamers and be camped so much I never reach level 2 than to listen to you whiny god awful fucking babies bitch about fucking streamers anymore.

There was a good while  where the whole "race AROUND the enemy" idea was fresh where we had a premade for AV on Mal'Ganis. It was pretty great. I was so happy when  I got The Unstoppable Force on my enh shaman.

Interesting to hear your experience. Particularly the fact that simple DE greens from leveling/questing isn't enough to naturally progress!
---
Crypts of karazhan isn't the actual karazhan instance from TBC it's an all new area, it's the unreleased crypts that were never made available  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9gGDrRevK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9gGDrRevK0)  I should have linked it and add more details I tought the name was obvious.
---
For the already seen content, most of it would be in a new form that isn't the same as what is is in the later stages(gilneas, hyjal etc would be compeltely different in classic) In cataclysm gilneas is fulyl corrupted by the worgen plague, in classic it would still be mostly a normal human kingdom that fights the worgen. Hyjal would be much differentbefore the cataclysm events with ragnaros and deathwing. Grim'Batol would look completely different than the cataclysm version that is corrupted by the twlight clan and all purple.
---
What you are saying is why I didn't add zones such as Karazhan tower, they would be the same. I mostly chose zones that would be much different than how they looked like in later expensions
---
Only hundreds?
---
They even give advice in /say if their victims can’t handle the heat 
---
“G o t o R e t a i l”
---
I see class, race, spec, professions as personal choice. 
---
The order they hit their buttons, ability to dodge bad, and know their way around the game/world, and understand how to gear themselves...those aren’t negotiable. 
---
You’re a bad player if you can’t do the above.
---
No one cares if you’re a Nelf spriest. There are consequences of that decision—you will be less desirable for raiding. But you play your game. Being a Nelf spriest and wearing nothing but spirit and agility Greens and +healing blues is not good, chilling for multiple globals not casting or sanding in PvP is not good. Not running out with geddon bomb, on the off chance you get into the raid is, you guessed it not good. 
---
Live your fantasy, but once you’re in the game, your aim should be to be good at the game you play.

Suggesting you don’t quit your job to have more time to play
---
for anyone who doesnt now there are WoW Playlists on spotify that are really good.  sometimes I'll put them on when I'm working/reading
---
I'm pretty sure Orgrimmar is inspired by Detroit.
---
I will be running the spec probably wont swap over until i am like 6/8 t1. OR at least try it. I mean i did it in half t1/t2 you can do it. The spec is fine even with a shield you will be able to maintain threat. And mobs in MC don't really hit hard so fuck yeah i am going to push going for DW/Defiance asap.
---
And the Devs have said it will stay in on release. The reasoning was that in classic, you could just log off your character and it would stop you at the next flight master. So this is essentially the same with saving a button click.
---
Most of them use Adderall just to be able to perform and "entertain".
---
Which I don't see a point in, honestly. Most of his and Sodapoppin's viewers have low IQ.
---
&gt;It is a shitty bg that everyone hates
---
Dont speak for me please. I love prenerf AV. If I care about maximizing honor and efficiency I go AB and WSG. The beauty of prenerf AV is you had a BG that appealed to a different audience than the other two BG's.
---
But Blizzard as always, just listens to those that whine the loudest, and they had to streamline it down into a boring zergfest.
---
You really don't need totemic focus lol, use some consumes.
---
You are missing so much from getting it like imp totems, imp your own windfury and 10% flat auto damage.
---
The real takeway though is to **build your rep.** I have never been great at PvP, but toward the end of vanilla I rerolled on a newer horde server and built a very solid rep as the best rogue there because I was good at exactly *one* thing: killing enemy FC's in WSG during a stalemate situation.
---
**Never voice frustration** at a loss.  If you stay positive, people will want to play with you and you'll be seen as a good PvPer even if you are totally mediocre.
---
I want to echo the sentiment that you don't need to be "good at PvP" when you start out.  You will get better at it with practice.  If you are a mediocre PvP player when you start the grind, you'll come out as a solid one, if not spectactular one at the end.
---
That's pretty neat. Never saw that in vanilla though!
---
I don't see how this is a scam. Were we not already combining hunter pets with their hunters as one player's dps?
---
I've seen an immortal undead priest too.
---
She can go to DN take fp then take boat to Darkshore.  Take FP then take boat to Menhil 
---
Take FP then swim along the shoreline until it say Dun morg.  Die and Release run to dwarf start zone and use spirit healer Rez there and Boom now you can play ;) takes ~10min.
---
Not my concern lol WHo cares about retail anyway
---
And then pay for the return trip...
---
Holy salt god damn
---
I don't remember that being in game before. Is it new to Classic?
---
You'd be the second (or the same) husband and wife combo that I've heard of. I met a couple in Darkshore during the dwarf escort quest on alliance pvp side.
---
How on earth is it toxic to celebrate something? O.o
---
Ahh. The OOMkin
---
Hunters have the most involved rotation in the game. It may not be complex by modern standards, but it is compared to every other class especially when you factor in pet management.
---
They also spend the most time on the game with video that blizzard could look back at. Other people will see bugs and report it for them. Time investment is the big one. Most play off stream also where they report more bugs I assume because they dont have to deal with "content " they create.
---
It's bugged in the current form
---
That'd be great, except Hunters use a two-roll system for all of their attacks. If you have no +hit, only 91% of your attacks can ever crit.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20091217122642/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t9816-hunter_spreadsheets_development/p53/
---
But it's not though, the current spellbatching AND leeway is bugged. Hopefully it gets fixed or else it will be gamebreaking.
---
That's gotta be it. Good find man, I'd never heard of this place.
---
Thank you Wealthy Pineapple.
---
I think you're mistaken about something, this kid isn't part of the classic community. He's part of the retail community and wants to make sure we know that he's not going to gracing us with his presence in Classic because he'll be too busy doing his world quests on a dead retail server.
---
Wrong. It will be available in phase 1.
---
Because it's the answer to OP's question. He asked why are people trying so hard, and the answer is you need to try hard to clear Naxx.
---
Yo, there are possibilities. Something unknown for example. A threat could evolve, but it must not. You could just help establish something, too. A good story doesn't always start with an imidiate threat. Maybe it's something intern, too. A person, who wants to destroy from within. Good stories can be so differently. Also the alliance and horde are not fully "good". And good stories live also from gray stories not only black and white. We had them in old WoW. Things where you work for money, but also think of the other perspective and if it is right what you do. And so on. Good stories don't need a big threat at the start or sometimes at all.
---
At least it’s not meth though. Totally agree that their viewers aren’t intelligent people.
---
How did he see it all so clearly...
---
Sounds like they really did capture the vanilla experience
---
Streamers aren't for testing they are free very effective advertising how hard is that to understand
---
Not really.
---
Absolutely not.  The amount of times I jumped from that very spot in random directions cannot be fathomed, and it has never happened to me nor anyone else I knew at the time.
---
What are some levels you should rush as a hunter to get a premier pet?
---
At that point just wait on the next ship from Theramore back to Menethil and hop on the Auberdine boat
---
Oh nice. There's more of us I'm sure.
---
And Shadowfang Keep is LG
---
I tought about that, but my goal was also to keep retail lore coherent, it wouldn't make sense  to find new zones that aren't already found on retail
---
I don't really want it to be a parallele unniverse, just untold stories that are coherent with what happened later in retail.
---
Stormstrike has a low debuff priority, it gets knocked off or not even applied, but the extra attack (and thus the extra proc chance) happens.
---
Hehe
---
Considering PVP is a much smaller percentage of the wow playerbase, and classic is the new hot thing coming out. This is to be expected... just saying. This is coming from a PVPer as well.
---
It's important to remember that AV is built around lvl 51-60 pugs, not lvl 60 (or in this case 58) premades. You're supposed to have lower level players who pretty much can't do anything worthwhile in pvp to help with the pve stuff and quests instead.
---
Exactly, that is the question. I haven't heard anything about it so I assume tuarens have a smaller deadzone
---
I don't remember which version sticks out most prominently in my mind, but at some point in vanilla, it was always like a 3-hour stalemate of people fighting on the bridge and refusing to just run up to the flag to cap it. Like, "fuck it I'll just go to sleep instead of wasting my time here" stalemate.
---
As a bored high schooler I would be all-caps berating the horde for not running past the alliance the whole time, but looking back I think all I accomplished was causing stress for myself.
---
Or running between quests. There is a lot of running and not a lot of UI stuff you got to deal with. Keybindigs can be done while running also. 
---
Add-on stuff I would be doing flying or standing, but how many do you need to level maybe only a few. Why does it matter for the first week anyhow.
---
Neither are bugged. But with so many people hating on it I can see blizz changing it anyway.
---
Lol they did that with retail... why not now?
---
Savage.
---
Salt city or not they aren’t wrong
---
fair enough, i just dont see myself ever getting to that point tbh since im not a raider
---
Sigh.  I don't think you're understanding what I'm trying to say.
---
Get paid to play, my man. Gotta leech that company dry before you totally quit.
---
I have a funny story about this. When I worked at EDS/HP years ago, they had this contract called "NMCI" - tech support for the military. It was a shitty T1 Helpdesk job (that moved up eventually if you were good). The company, culture, benefits, everything - was complete dogshit. However, because management also knew how dogshit it was, often times you could just coast by with calling out sick more than you should, typically.
---
However there was this one weird thing someone once discovered. Typically when you're being terminated (voluntarily or not), they take you the office manager to sign some exit papers, take your CAC (Common Access Card) and building badge, and cut you out that day. Put in your 2 weeks? Cool, well your last day is today, fuck off.
---
So this guy eventually had his fill of shit and just left and never came back. Didn't turn in his badges, just quit. Well, he kept getting paychecks. Steady $900 paychecks every 2 weeks while he worked a totally different job. Eventually he sent his badges back and they stopped sending him a paycheck, but they never tried collecting the back pay.
---
One of my friends was in a similar boat there. His manager kept reducing his hours - he wasn't firing him, but he was basically trying to push him out to quit on his own. So he just left. Same thing as the other guy did. And for 4 months straight he just collected his biweekly paychecks via direct deposit while he played pool and drank every night.
---
I wish that could happen to me now.
---
That's a whole lot of words when just a "babyrage" would have done.
---
Debatable.
---
AV expectations: Summoning bosses, calling in reinforcements and advancing strategically over the course of a 24 hour epic battle.
---
AV reality: Rush to General, ignoring any type of conflict on the way, to maximize honor per hour. If someone decides to turtle /afk out. Repeat until Exalted. Never queue AV again.
---
Give it a break, Blizzard is an indie game dev company, this is their first shot at MMORPGs.
---
You are not missing out on anything.  I have the improved totems in the build that I posted.  Aside from elemental warding, you are not missing out on anything in the elemental tree.
---
You make it sound like trying to be as good as you can be is somehow a bad thing.  
---
If you want to be one of those guys at the bottom of the DPS meter by 20%+, then by all means, do it and have fun.  I'd rather actually know I am not being carried by other people, and that is what I consider fun.  Luckily for many, I enjoy being the one to carry and hold no resentment towards those who aren't as good/dedicated.  
---
So yea, many people are going to be way more optimal this time around, and people like you need to accept it and move on.  If you want to suck ballsack and coast, then by all means you can do what you have fun with... but don't try to justify it in a group context, because people absolutely WILL care if you aren't trying.

Off tank Warrior spamming hamstring
---
The functionality was still there as you could go to Character selection screen and log back in.
---
Not with their time to make the change
---
He gets the same amount of viewers no matter what he plays, it's not a Classic vs Retail argument.
---
Excellent work, well done!
---
Some things actually require skill and effort. Standing stationary and pushing buttons only get so far. If that's all you want to accomplish,  that's fine. But don't pretend there's not a lot more to it than that in high-end raiding.
---
So maybe high end raiding isn't for you. Or you just like to be carried. And at some point, that will be noticed.
---
Very useful for hamstring kiting which is a super useful technique for warriors while leveling
---
I don't think that is generalizable.  
---
At lower gear (crit) levels, more crit is more beneficial than more hit.  But as you reach higher levels of crit, hit becomes more valuable. 
---
For example, if you replace your 20% base crit with 25% base crit, hit becomes more valuable than additional crit.  
---
9% hit/25% base crit  multiplier becomes 1.38, 0% crit 34% base crit multiplier becomes 1.31, a 22% increase in the multiplier.
---
So is it fair to say that people who say classic wow will give us peak sub numbers might have their hopes set a little too high? I’d assume if that was actually feasible then their marketing campaign would be as big as it was in the wotlk days.
---
Actually Feral druids can do really good
---
Asmon could switch to pretty much any game and still keep those viewers so it really don't mean a whole lot.
---
Hi Josh,
---
Great episode as always, but I think we could continue to play devil's advocate here with Trollgodx. I would first ask one question that could play a part in my argument in support of Trollgodx. Not directly supporting his actions, but why Blizzard's inaction or solving the problem with a light touch (what they did by teleporting him to Winterspring) would be the best route. The tournament, with a cash prize going to the winner, was it sponsored by Blizzard or was it just an event sponsored and bankrolled by the streamers involved?
---
If sponsored by Blizzard, then the location of the duels should have been in an isolated environment. It is my experience that all other E-sports (which I would classify a dueling tournament sponsored by Blizzard to be classified as an E-sport) take place in an isolated environment. Examples include their WoW Arena, Overwatch,  and Starcraft 2 tournaments at any level. The relevance of Overwatch and Starcraft may be difficult to argue, but it is near impossible for an individual such as Trollgodx to interact with those competitors to grief or impede their ability to compete; short of some super-hacker capability that I am unaware of existing (not including DDoS).
---
Why is this point important? If the event is not sponsored by Blizzard, then those streamers are at the mercy of their own design. I am not 100% sure of the logistics involved with beta as far as if beta players are having to pay a subscription fee or not, but players such as Trollgodx have their own place in a world created by Blizzard. A world which may be susceptible to griefing, but where each person in that world is paying their share and have their own place because of that fact. Yes, there will always be that few who may have it out for that world and will try to create dysfunction, but the ToS somewhat protects them. As Josh had pointed out in the show, the ToS is certainly malleable and open to Blizzard's discretion in defining what may be categorized as griefing.  
---
I support the decision to teleport Trollgodx to Winterspring because it was Blizzard's way of applying a light touch to a minor problem. Of course, the trolling done by Trollgodx may be interpreted differently, but his level of annoyance and so-called griefing were minor in the grand scheme of griefing if looked at objectively. Should he have received a suspension or ban? Neither. Unless Blizzard deliberately said that the event was sponsored by them (which as I stated earlier, they could have taken their own precautions of isolating the competitors), Trollgodx is yet another participant in the world.
---
I am not looking to disagree with the annoyance and anger that Trollgodx created, I only wanted to say that he was dealt with appropriately for what I would say is a low level of griefing if looking at all of the ways possible of what would be defined as griefing. 
---
One final question: Do you think Trollgodx will be immortalized in the same way players such as Angwe have been, or will he be forgotton? I'm leaning towards some sort of memory of him being kept, if only because of him being discussed in podcasts such as this one.
---
A second Prot specced warrior is never needed. You just use a DPS warrior with prot gear.
---
It was the vast majority of players who hated it. People acting like those multiday games are great are the vocal minority who are whining loud. In actual reality, everyone hated it. I know, because I played back then.
---
Honestly, hearing people say they liked that is baffling to me.   I can't recall a single person I knew liking it, and I was always big into the pvp scene. To pretend like anything more than an EXTREME minority didn't hate old AV is just revisionist history
---
You do realize that in 40 man raids, it was generally common to have 25 people carrying the other 15 right?  Even in serious raiding guilds, the good always carried the bad and that was the way of things.
---
It is also why blizzard moved into 25 man raiding so that they could design raids in a way that didn't allow for as much leeway.  Bottom line is that you can't coast through content if hardly anyone is trying in vanilla... not sure where you got your information, but it is clear you didn't play back then.
---
It already kinda works like that but you will almost never see situations for this change to work for hunter's advantage.

As a Frost mage you can aoe grind. Warlocks are also great grinders regardless of spec.
---
Where do I see the "You can't play WoW Classic yet" message?
---
Well I'm not a professional story writter, I just did it with an easy way to introduce the content, Blizzard writters can come up with something more interesting
---
 How the content is introduced wasn't really the main point of my post I think, it's just the content ideas.
---
You are a complete moron.  We have no idea if they are overtuned or not yet.  Raid content is not available for testing in the classic beta atm.
---
You are making pure assumptions and nothing else.   Feel free to link us your sources for this so called proof.  I'd love to be proven wrong that you aren't a complete dickwad.
---
I remember running low levels through it. Had a new player who was awestruck by it. When I ran it again with a few other people but that same new player he was like "Wait until you see the ship, it's so cool!" And another player was like being a bit rude telling him that he already knows.
---
Felt a bit annoyed by that to be rude to a new player. I miss that feeling of being impressed by dungeons.
---
It’s useful for quest items, pages of quest books.
---
But also good for some stuff. 
---
It’s risky transferring stuff as folk look to use the neutral AH a lot to catch folk trying to move mats cheaply.
---
Priest: Is always the main tank in PvP
---
I'm sure Activision-Blizzard has much better people in their marketing department that have forecasted the best way to advertise and what the numbers will be, but my uneducated guess is that we won't see peak numbers. It's certainly going to be popular and I don't think there's going to be some massive dropoff after 2-3 months, but again, it's a 15 year old game and this is fan service not trying to break any records.
---
Some recipes and items are locked behind raids and only one faction may have a surplus of them. There are also faction exclusive BoEs, like pets.
---
We sold Elementium Bars to an Alliance guild for an insane price because they couldn't find any on their side at all.
---
It looks better because the old animation you're literally gliding across the ground.
---
blasted lands is inspired by afghanistan
---
It is no use arguing with these fools until the full game is done and out.  
---
Bottom line is that even if it turns out that raid content is overtuned on pservers, we have absolutely no way of knowing until we see classic's raid content.  They are clinging to straws atm.
---
Yep there will be, so a shadow is kinda viable from the very start already.
---
It was miscounting.  FWIW it counted the damage twice for the hunter if they did this.
---
I took a bit of time since my last post and scoured all the Patchwerk kills I could find on YT.  None featured hunters anywhere near the top (I don't remember any of these guilds in these vids FWIW, though).
---
MM hunters have great burst DPS so easy to grind. Growl spam / FD great threat dumps, it’s easy to grind and farm as a MM hunter.
---
Agreed and happy cake day!
---
My birthday is the day after it releases. I'm so making this cake now!
---
It’s ironic, because the “larger” deadzone is exactly the same as it was in vanilla. You can test it on pservers, it’s the same there. It’s never **really** been 8 because it has to account for hitboxes. The current 11m is exactly the way it was in vanilla.
---
Melee leeway doesn’t hurt hunters at all. It doesn’t affect their deadzone and it increases the range at which they can wing clip anyways. Melee leeway hurts casters, not hunters.
---
Don't base anything off this math. It's completely wrong because he assumes crits don't need to hit first.
---
You will get parry haste gibbed.
---
Hahahaha its all about me me me!
---
Alright alright. I honestly was not aware anyone I’ve ever heard of using it was for transferring items or gold. For instance 
---
I got an item that’s great for shamans on my gnome as a boe and wanna sell it to the horde, what are the chances of anyone actually using the ah for that purpose
---
Did they not put in some invisible walls to prevent people from leaving SW on the AV realm? Maybe this is from that?
---
You can do whatever you want, but how is it a PSA to people who choose not to do it because they simply don't feel like it?
---
Its confirmed its there to stay.
---
Happened to me too dude nothing we can do about it, if you really wanna cure the itch you have to play the game. I would recommend checking out the private servers, they are actually popin off right now full of people who did not get into beta ect ether.
---
Warrior - leveling
---
Plus, TG came in Wrath.
---
I have upon occasion, to sell:  Alliance specific pets to the other alliance. Useful matts for higher level recipes/plans etc. Items in bags that I don’t want to vend, bank, or mail to auction back home later. If it doesn’t sell cross faction, I’ll have another chance when it comes back to me.
---
It wasn't in the game before but you could accomplish the same thing in real vanilla by just logging out and logging on again.
---
I know, right
---
"I don't want any rewards from AV"
---
"Omgzord you only want fast rewards, go play fortnite"
---
There is a disconnect between the hipsters pretending they liked AV and reality. Oh well
---
Yea, I think people are underestimating how big that is going to become lol
---
You could get a swing timer so that you only sinister strike right after your auto attacks so you don’t cannibalize a sword spec proc. That’s one technique that you could employ to give you an edge. 
---
Basically sword spec extra hit resets your auto attack timer - so by delaying your sinister strike till right after your main hand auto goes through ensures that if sword spec procs off the sinister strike the reset on your auto attack will be minimized as much as possible.
---
I believe fury warriors with windfury have the highest possible nightfall uptime.
---
AssManBald is so kewl gaiz
---
People don't really check the neutral AH that often unless they've communicated cross-faction and are expecting an item to be listed.
---
As long as you like the name, its a good name. No one else cares about your name. I only notice three kind of names.
---
Funny Punny Names (Gnomercy)
---
Terrible Names (Xdanksephiroth)
---
Unique names that I'm surprised you got. Any cool RPG noun. (Missile, Charisma, Agility, etc)
---
IF to Southshore when I wanted to go to Menethil is a common one for me
---
I fail to see your argument.
---
The entire reason why Classic exists is because “a significant amount of the player base” DEMANDED welfare epics, easy mode, simplified everything, mounts at level 5 (or w/e the hell it is in Retail now). 
---
Crybabies demanded the game be easier/simplified. World PvP was caught in the crossfire. That doesn’t make it irrelevant. Quite the contrary.
---
Yeah that’s what’s I was afraid of haha
---
you also have to remember that in most cases HoA's take care of many things around your house in your neighborhood. From the sidewalk to that strip of grass between it and the road along with any trees/etc in those spots. 
---
Additionally, it's not really like anyone can complain. We agree to their terms before we even move in/build our houses. Some HoA's are absurd 200/month some are really cheap (like mine 200/year). I more so said it for the sake of others because I know the pain, my last house was 150/month but they even shoveled my drive way and trimmed trees/bushes on my property for me.
---
I don't think i will but we will sure see if it works or not on classic.
---
That'd be fine, if losing your best DPS class was worth the Nightfall proc, but it isn't. Shaman bring a lot more utility, so they're the best for it.
---
Warlock - pet damage doesn't scale
---
All I hear is “Fat Bottomed Girls”
---
I have little memories from back then, but I remember as MM I had issues with over aggro my pet, even if just auto-attack... I guess thats why Blizzard added Go for the throat talent in TBC..
---
Arcane Frost misses lot of key talents for aoe grind though :(
---
Nah it will be old news for the streamers and the people watching.
---
As far as tanking goes, simply put, the game is so fucked by design in vanilla that you simply cannot use another tank other than a warrior. It's the only class which can resist crushing blows, of course they're also heavily overtuned because they get 3 very strong cooldowns and shield block which is the very definition of a broken ability, it single handedly makes warrior 10 thousand years ahead of any other class in single target tanking.
---
To make the other classes be reliably decent even as off tanks you have to:
---
1) Give them real tanking cooldowns, gear and threat management. 
---
Paladins literally don't have any tanking abilities other than Holy Shield(level 40) and Blessing of Sanctuary(debatable as a tank ability anyway) and Druids much like Paladins, also lack any tanking decent tanking cooldowns, acceptable end game gear (it's just terrible on both sides) and have threat problems. (Paladins especially, because of no taunt.)
---
Sure you can AOE tank as a Paladin on undead dungeons but you're not a real tank, you're literally paper in front of a raid boss.
---
2) Nerf Warriors to the ground.
---
Make them unable to resist crushing blows and nerf their threat generation. But now you get a bigger problem, you need to adjust the bosses because I don't think you can even tank a raid boss without this.
---
Also in the case of shaman's enhancement as it was build, it's simply a meme, I cannot fathom how someone could create such an abomination of a talent and think "wow this is great, it will totally work". And it's not like all vanilla talent trees are bad, the mage talent tree is one of the best in the game, it was so good that they barely had to changed much of it over the years. Sure Arcane has seen better days but Fire and Frost were very good.
---
In the case of shaman they really need to make it again and simply scrap stupid things like two hand weapon skill and parry skill as talents.
---
Possible but very rare. Even on private servers, the premades are usually taking 15-20 min. Highly organized premades that don't face any sort of organized defense can do it in less than 10, but it doesn't happen often. And then factor in that you have to coordinate queues out of raid and may get unlucky and have the whole premade end up in different AV's, it's not really great honor unless it's AV weekend.
---
I just watched a streamer do it multiple times in a row on his gnome warlock. Was doing it mounted too.
---
Paladin levels slow, not much for movement abilities
---
How does paladin have higher uptime?   Shamans get 30% attack speed and an instant attack on a cooldown.
---
Dont know about Uldum, but definitely Anh Qiraj is inspired in Egypt
---
That's what the /camp command was meant to do lol
---
You can add this to Hunter as well.
---
Farming soul shards isn't a big deal lol their negative is their true damage potential is completely clipped because they have no innate threat reduction, so in a raid/dung they fulfil more of a utility dps role. Luckily in pvp threat doesn't matter so you get to blow people up.
---
But druid/pally/shaman are pretty much all forced to heal so that could be a negative depending on if you want to heal or not. 
---
Warriors also overpopulated so it'd have troubles gearing like a mage would, especially cause it also competes with rogues and hunters for weapons and some armors if fury.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
IMO if Classics works out as well as we all hope I wouldn’t be surprised if Blizzard wants to add extra ways to monetize it. 
---
I’m still standing by for some kind of optional Classic Deluxe/Collectors edition.
---
You didn't say what was needed you said shaman had the highest possible uptime
---
I think parry haste will be an issue during progression.
---
He needs to go back to other games and take his toxic base with him honestly
---
Pfft. I wish warlock demons did as much damage as hunter pets. Would be a massive upgrade
---
Thanks for a polite reply. I totally understand what you are saying, and I've just decided to keep it to myself from now on
---
It was my single favorite thing about retail vanilla. I played hunter so that might've been part of why, but either way, I spent countless hours in pre nerf AV, and it was the greatest fun I ever had in WoW. Yes, it's probably a minority that enjoyed AV back then, but at least that minority really liked the original AV. Nobody likes 1.12 AV. And there's a reason why it's remembered so fondly by many people, hell i'd say original AV is one of the main things associated with vanilla WoW today.
---
Druids aren't good at anything.  Just sort of mediocre at everything.
---
Hunters have meh dps, and micromanaging your furrball is annoying.  Less bag space, because of arrows.  Nef breaks your bow too, lol.
---
Mages.  You are a vendorbot. 
---
Paladin.  Healbot bitch.  Tank and dps spec is a total joke.  If you are lucky, someone might let you be the nightfall bitch.
---
Priest:  Healbot bitch.  If you are lucky, someone might let you be the spriest.
---
Rogue: idk.  No honor dbags that gank people low on health while farming?
---
Shaman:  Same as druid really.  You are not good at anything, except chain heal gimmick.  If you are lucky, someone might let you be the enhance shammy, which is kind of shitty.
---
Warrior:  Too op, so overpopulated.
---
Warlock: Summon bitch
---
Blasted lands is based off hellfire peninsula because they're connected.
---
Maybe I'm crazy, and I also don't know much about Tips, but can't multiple people have the same names and family names? How do we know for sure that it's him and not someone else? Any pics?
---
It's not an appeal to authority, an appeal to authority would be "Listen to me because I have authority over you", he's saying people just don't have enough information to be able to come to an accurate conclusion.
---
I've also STILL yet to hear a better alternative to layering.
---
And no, not everyone is anti-layering, a lot of us welcome layering at the start. It's going to be temporary and any minor advantage people will be able to get out of it will have virtually no impact on the server economy because of how short a time layering will exist.
---
There's a lot of people crying wolf right now.
---
3 % xD
---
Did you see the discussion we had about this yesterday in another thread? Here's a video demonstrating how [leeway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_cLN66zHA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=123) worked.
---
Melee leeway is a separate issue from the biggest issue hunters are having right now, which is that their 8yd deadzone is extended to approx. 11yds.
---
Which means the melee leeway is currently bigger than the ranged deadzone. It sucks that the deadzone is incorrect in the beta, but Blizzard knows about it and they're going to fix it. You'll be able to breathe again soon once they figure out the problem.
---
More like brother in law guild
---
Yep. This guy was my lifer pet until I switched to a pally in mid Wrath. He was also a unique model until they added an identical quest lion named "Patch" in Sholazar Basin.
---
If you put someone on ignore list for seeing if you want to do a dungeon you’re a snowflake ass bitch.
---
Does it not seem strange to you to argue against small % gains when talking about optimizing for best? 
---
A gain is a gain and if you are looking at best then...
---
I mean - wtf are you talking about?
---
Oh i won't be dwing when we are progressing no way i mean i will have deathwish as an ability. But i do not have one as a tank. Not until i am adequately geared will i swap over to actually DWing. As i said previously not until i get about 6/8 pieces of t1 and have BOA and my LHH to compensate for some of the hit will i then swap over and try to see if it works in Early MC. There are some bosses in BWL that will be able to easily tank with DW. But there are others that won't work as well even in MC.
---
I was at launch. It's not the boogyman you are making it sound like. 
---
Fans forgive rocky launches as it is to be expected. They do not forgive poor design choices. 
---
All your issues at the bottom ignore the concept of predetermined clusters. Sounds lkke your just a blizz fanboy and whatever they say must be the word of god. Sorry I disagree.
---
They both are
---
Lucky druids, that's what pushed me off main'ing heals though. I usually play Paladins.
---
Thanks for the in depth reply I was leaning towards shaman or Paladin, I feel like dwarf paladins were/are super under played.
---
Papa knows.

I asked a guy with beta here
---
Hoes mad
---
There are 3 positions to have, right?
---
\-Being a tryhard is bad and you shouldn't do it.
---
\-Not being a tryhard is bad and you should do it.
---
\-Play what you want.
---
This post is firmly in the first category. They're literally telling people who want to tryhard that they don't understand classic and to go raid on retail.
---
This happened with osrs and I called it happening for classic wow. 
---
At the end of the day we are older than what we used to be and have less time, more responsibilities, and more reasons to use our free time or gaming time or whatever designated time for wow as efficiently as possible.
---
We didn’t care back in the day if we spent days on end wandering around Azeroth doing nothing lol, we had the time back then it’s just a different time for everyone now.
---
I’d expect a large emphasis on efficiency and being optimal
---
Edit: not saying I agree nor disagree with how it should or shouldn’t be, just simply explaining why there’s a shift in play styles
---
Now we need a WoW fashion sub, similar to what Dark Souls and Rocket League has.
---
Field of Strafe.  Fun times.
---
If you rock a female dwarf pally you will be one of maybe five on the whole server. Plus for healing the twin braids hair is one of the best looks because those things fly everywhere. But you are welcome, I try to pass on the knowledge or experience that i know from and have done in my days of playing wow.
---
Somebody must have given you DMF
---
I like it how it was. This new animation sucks ass. The feet move way too fast seems like he trying to catch up to himself lol. Terrible
---
It really be like that
---
Bingo. I’m going horse this time because throughout my entire time playing wow I never did level and play horde. So for me wow will be somewhat new to me.
---
Yep. The feels
---
AV is alliance sided. Alliance need the extra help 😂
---
Yeah maybe the first patch should be an overhaul to the leveling experience with lot of new questing areas(I actually tought about that and there is potential for a lot new leveling zones), but I don't know if people would be interested in that or they might think that it makes the leveling too easy and too much different.
---
I love both of them but come on, if Batman is just a "crappier, emo version" then may as well throw how Iron man is littered with plotholes and is the leading cause of plot armor for Marvel.
---
They're both great, but it's okay to like Iron man more without bashing a beloved and fundamental comic book hero.
---
It’s a PSA because some people have never played a version of the game without LFG/LFR. If you already knew about this and choose not to, no sweat. What exactly is your question?
---
What is your obsession with needing an overpopulated server?
---
I think of you are think you need an overpopulated server to play on maybe you need the queue to realise medium pop is fine.
---
Yup. Exactly
---
Eh, I think streamers are a bunch of low lives who don’t contribute to society, so while I don’t think complaining is efficient by any means, the op isn’t wrong in that streamers are a plague to humanity. If you think about it, all those unintelligent people who send streamers money could be sending money to charities or foundations to help those in need but are instead sending money to people who spend days on end playing video games and making unintelligent comments. It’s quite sad really.
---
MoP sucked so no.
---
Yeah that's definitely a big one to be worried about, but I believe we've solved that problem by having a need/greed system in place, where if nobody wants an item at 100% of cost, it passes to greed at a fraction of the cost, then to off-spec/DE etc.
---
Blizzard needs to change this to how it was in Vanilla. This is a big deal fir rogues.
---
have you even played vanilla, lol
---
If you're only using the loot council for special circumstances like TF and such then it should be pretty obvious who deserves it (In the case of TF- MT&gt;Highest performing rogue/highest performing warrior&gt;you're not getting any more) my guild uses a similar system, our GM writes up a sheet and uses a form of DKP for how often people attend raids and get pieces of loot and uses that to hand out most things but for really contentious pieces of loot he'll just say "we should give the Skull of Gul'dan to the shadow priest first because it helps VT greatly which keeps our healers mana topped up, giving us easier boss fights" (actual example from our first skull drop on Illidan on a private server recently, it caused a few people to moan but most understood the guild gains over personal gains)
---
I don't want any version of AV either, but there are people who play AV that want the older version (somehow one vanilla patch is more vanilla than another, blows my mind how petty some of the community is), so our voice should at least give other players something they want since its no loss to us. In good classic community love.
---
And the old one he glides across the floor. Way worse.
---
See how objective opinions that don’t change gameplay are just that, opinions?
---
If that makes you not play rogue, good riddance. We don’t need more.
---
I think the thing is most people playing meme/dead specs aren't exactly engaged to begin with. If someone can't be bothered to do a little work optimizing they most likely aren't going to really be bothered to do mechanics. We all know players who afk or check out during boss explanations then die to the first mechanic. Or the person who never has consumables or runs to the instance. Its death by a thousand cuts really. Those types of players really drain your best players. Why should they put in more effort when others are asleep at the wheel?
---
Ultimately people will and should play they way they want. Both hardcore and casual.
---
If they have their bags full of Manual Crowd Pummelers maybe
---
Who's we?
---
Wow is not bad, it's just different than what it once was. It's been around for 15 years and still has more millions of players. It doesn't matter if a game lost half it's player base, a game with millions of players would still not be considered a bad game. I'd love to know where you got your numbers also.
---
And a quick search for where you got 1.7M was based on a tweet from the weak auras guys about some new API which was later removed because they didn't actually know if the data was even accurate.
---
&gt; WeakAuras said that “the original post with those findings has since been deleted, not sure if because Blizzard threatened to sue or because it was false data” That means you should take the new findings with a heavy pinch of salt.
---
So yea, unless you get actual sub numbers from Blizzard (which they haven't provided in a really long time), it's all just speculation
---
I have personally never seen this loot system used so I am not 100% confident I know how it will play out. It seems to be the most fair and balanced when compared to the favoritism or corruption that is found with the other systems.
---
That is fair but Im saying you arent "paying the same price"
---
What’s sad is how much you care about how someone else spends their money and time lol
---
Naxx requires a lot of consumables. If you don't put in the effort your gonna have a bad time.
---
Then I'm right. Trying to be a combat dagger in aq/naxx is gimping yourself! Is it viable? yes. Is it optimal? no, sword does more damage.
---
Well not everyone tries their best to play games. When I play games with my family, the object is definitely more to spend time together and have fun than it is to win. I don't think it's entirely fair to say that no team activity is ever worthwhile if you're not investing a 100% effort into winning. There'd be no point in the vast majority of football matches, for example.
---
That said, wow raiding doesn't lend itself particularly well to social play, that is true.
---
That is raid optimization, not class optimization.
---
Sadly no amount of game patching can fix human stupidity of which there is plenty already in 20 man raids and is especialy in effect in 40 mans. Most encounters have been designed around that and as basic as they seem today will still cause a lot of trouble for a lot of guilds on certain fights across all raids.
---
I see it as a post directed at the countless number of players that are making posts about how they can't decide on what race or class and they never played Vanilla etc etc.
---
The majority of those players AREN'T try hards. They're regular players curious about Classic.
---
I took the post as saying "Don't but into the whole "You need to be optimal to raid or you won't get invited" because that's what the majority of these posts directly reference, people are afraid to play what they want because they think they won't get into guilds/groups/raids. Doesn't help when you have tryhards basically telling people "If you pick Tauren Warrior no one will raid with you it's Orc/Troll or nothing"
---
On K2 every single match was 8 mins and it was totally unorganised pugs so I don't agree that it's rare at all.
---
The queues were done by everyone going to the portal so the second the game ends and you leave you instantly requeue by touching the portal.
---
1.05 AV is still superior though and I wish we gor that instead of 1.12 AV.
---
   You can't miss a crit, right?   So, 71% chance to hit, and 20% chance to crit, and 9% chance to miss.
---
Normal hit
---
(100-9-20)/100 \*x = 0.71\*x
---
Critical hit (20%)
---
(20)\*2/100 \*x = 0.4\*x
---
Dps
---
0.71x + 0.4 x =1.11x
---
\----------------------
---
\+1% hit
---
(100-8-20)/100 \*x  + (20)\*2/100 \*x = 1.12x
---
\+1% crit
---
(100-9-21)/100 \*x  + (21)\*2/100 \*x = 1.12x
---
There's a Youtube video and several pictures of TipsOut wearing FTR International swag and talking about his leadership role in the company. He's the one that tried to bully the council members by calling them racists and he's the one that ended up $25 million in debt because of the fraud. Not his dad, him.
---
Just google "TipsOut FTR International" and you'll find it.
---
Me and my personalities, all of them! ;)
---
You anti-tryhard people have literally been spamming the forum with "don't tell me how to play" type posts. Can we get you to extend the same courtesy the other way please?
---
So when you get an item it lowers your total buying power for the next item correct? So giving people a need/green option for a discounted rate would still affect a persons buying power later on in the raid but not by much? Do you use a % value across the board when accounting for the discount or do you make up item values individually?
---
I don’t care what people spend their time and money on, what’s sad is that people feel so insignificant in their own lives that rather than being productive in society or helping those in need, they spend their time trying to get notice by a streamer or trying to be famous as a streamer.
---
Isn't 1.12 version the nerfed AV where NPCs don't do nearly as much damage
---
Well you don't optimize classes. You optimize raids.
---
Streamers are in beta for free advertising of Classic. 
---
The rest of the beta players are for testing.
---
I like Av, but I would be more into it if they brought back the earlier versions imo.
---
Mostly interested in it for pure big group vs big group pvp and the frostwolf howler.
---
Was watching some vids on Youtube, and this pair of vids got me so excited to see some of these places again. Its crazy how long it has been. Its even more strange to think that, at this point, we have spent more time with the Post-Cata zones, than we did with their original counterparts.

I think it flip flops based on drops all the way up.. So like if you have CTS you will go higher than dagger spec. Then any combo of death's sting ,maexnna fang + harbinger is higher dps than any swords other than thunderfury.
---
&gt; You can't miss a crit, right?
---
The determination of whether a Hunter attack is a crit or not happens  AFTER the determination of whether a Hunter attack misses or not.
---
Correct, at least on Retail
---
&gt; It's going to be temporary
---
It wouldn't be a big deal if it were going to be limited but these things have a way of persisting beyond the optimistic promises that they make in the beta phase. 
---
And here I acknowledge Mr. Staats' point but also speculate about motives. What it comes down to for me is motivation; who is Blizzard trying to please? Themselves? Their investors? Their players? If it is their players then why are they implementing a sharding system that will have a rotating cast of strangers coming and going from the player's perspective? Why are they not maintaining a static population within which the player exists level to 60 alongside the same cast of strangers, acquiantances, and enemies? We did that in Vanilla and it was amazing.
---
So I do not think this could possibly be for the benefit of the player. And here I challenge Mr. Staats by speculating: this system pleases Blizzard. It simplifies the process. Hire an engineer to jury rig existing sharding tech and automatically smooth out population fluctuations. View it as a mechanical problem. Avoid the extra work required to manually massage disparate populations within Clusters. Hope the players accept it and, when the time comes that the system is ingrained into the reality of the experience, do not turn the system off. It's convenient.
---
A thousand times this. I like doing whats optimal. There are tons of casual guilds that will let you show up without consumables, doesn't care if you're in your PvP spec and wearing your Tier gear because its cooler than your BiS, etc. 
---
But I don't want to be in that guild. Thats not fun for me.
---
Because most of the stuff added to wow over the years is what a large group of the playerbase asked for in the game. 
---
Regardless of what vanilla only players thought the game moved forward and got even bigger because of the changes and not in spite of them. 
---
Personally I think the gaming world needs more of these guys to spit hard truths, feelings be damned. So many times you see gamers get up in arms because someone was condescending or had the wrong attitude. 
---
Yet they would be the first to turn around and be downright nasty towards developers. 
---
Its not a dick thing to do in the real world to give people hard truths and say things people don't wanna hear.
---
I could not disagree more with practically every one of your sentences and you cannot compare wow 15 years ago to wow today.
---
Nobody says you will not be able to raid. You are attacking the strawman. The point is it is a choice you might end up regretting because 300 vs 305 weapon skill is *huge* and cannot be easily compensated for through gear.
---
You guys might end up convincing someone unknowing to pick something they will regret later on. Instead of speaking out of your ass and issuing multiple logical fallacies, *how about we inform newcomers about what he drawbacks are*? Because that way they can make up your own mind. If you are saying “it does not matter” then you are lying. It matters. It’s a significant difference. You can still do it and you can also choose to play one handed if you prefer jerking off while playing.
---
Imagine if we had gotten Cataclysm after Classic WoW instead of TBC/WOTLK. Thanks TBC.
---
allright, i can't speak for K servers, but they are known to be heavily undertuned. On all nost core servers (by far the most played servers) it takes premades an average of 15-20 min. Very rarely they manage it in 10. Also about 1/3 of AVs outside of weekend end up being several hour long turtles.
---
And the queueing at same time thing works most of the time, but not always. I've been in several premades where everything got delayed several times because we got split up 20/20 into two different AV ids, even when we queued on command from leader from voice chat
---
That's why I plan to be the Winter's Chill mage if I can. Deep Frost so I can grind with ease.
---
It makes you, without a question, the best tank ever so long as the boss fight has no restrictions on encounter duration such as an instant raid wipe mechanic a la Kazzak. So long as the Priest has enough time to build threat, most encounters become a walk in the park.
---
It also cuts the need for healers down by half.
---
The games are as long as people want them to be, and that's always how it's been. If you have 10+ people who want to defend at any costs, then you the game will last, but basically what happens is that people realize you are not rewarded for defending, so they stop.
---
That's awesome!
---
Some BoE Shaman or Pally loot would sell well to the opposite faction.
---
Not even slightly. It’s the golden standard.
---
&gt; as long as you show up to the raid on time you're fine
---
definitely not. if you show up for a naxx raid without frost resistance and consumes, you are a liability and not an asset.
---
Unless you can give a citation that shows the K servers version of AV is undertuned it makes no sense to blindly claim it.
---
The queueing at the same time doesn't even need to work most of the time when both sides mostly ignore each other and everyone just rushes the bonus honor. Even pugs manage that.
---
9% for tranq bosses 8% for everything else
---
That was TBC as I recall. You needed a shit tons of  AV mark for the weapons maybe.
---
Later you could buy previous season gear with only honor. But that was maybe in Wrath.
---
If you're working 60h\week you're not gonna make 60 in 2 weeks^^
---
Buys 100 shares of GRUB
---
Is your boyfriend rolling one too?
---
Yeah it would still increase their GP, or gear points, but instead of taking an item at full value, let’s say 100GP, if they choose greed it’d be 50GP(depending on the % reduction chosen, just as example I used 50%). It’d be the same A% discount across the board
---
I would check out the bis leveling wand guides that have been floating sprung and make sure you craft as many of those as you can while leveling ench. They will definitely sell for decent profit on the AH.
---
You just use sweeping, and swap into defensive stance, or sweeping, whirlwind, def stance cleave. Its not very tough to figure out!
---
You definitely do not need a prot specced tank for any dungeon in Vanilla.
---
MCU did Hulk dirty simply because he wasn't as popular, it's a shame. He became Worf - the guy to beat up to prove how tough and powerful you are.
---
Doesn't change a single thing on what he said.
---
Shamans biggest downside is not having any hard CC. They don't really have a way to lock down an opponent. Raid Groups often times bring as many geared Shamans as they have access too, so the competition for gear can be fierce.
---
Warriors biggest downside is the leveling experience is hard and slow. Lots of eating and bandaging. They get dicked on by mages, but every class seems to get dicked on my someone.
---
Druids upside is there downside. They are versatile and have an answer to every problem; but they never have the best answer to any specific problem. In raids they have the lowest HPS, but like Hunters they bring enough utility to make up for it.
---
This is what nightmares are made of...

"LALALALA I KNOW BETTER YOU'RE A SHILL"
---
-This guy
---
Just saving this for later, great questions
---
He's already Deathwing. He's believed dead before Cataclysm.
---
Only an idiot would think it's supposed to work like that, on a server that won't even fit one third of a layer.
---
going hunter and naming my cat pet after my irl pet cat gg only name that matters
---
can still farm lashers with ease
---
Seal of the Crusader that can be sustained constantly I suspect they are betting on over the flurry which is a proc.
---
just wait
---
&gt; Just saying that there's really no reason to worry about it unless you're speedrunning or server firsting
---
And like clockwork, here comes the false dichotomy that there is no middle ground between "casual" and "speedrun world first".
---
Right, so you can't miss a crit, unless your crit chance is insanely high.  
---
If I have 20% crit chance, then in 100 shots, 9 miss, 20 Crit, and 71 hit for normal damage.  This is how I thought the hit table worked.  
---
Are you saying for hunters, it works differently?  That their crit chance is 20% of the 91% hit chance?  That's not how I recall it working, but it's been a long time.
---
If you think Paladins "buff and rez" and do nothing else, then you have never played 1.12
---
I dont understand you people
---
I like how every single one is wrong.
---
There is no purchasing WoW Classic, it just requires a subscription and that same subscription will let you play all the way up to 110 in Retail right now.
---
If you've never played WoW at all, just download the Free Starter Edition and get a feel for it. There's not much more that Retail is going to teach you.
---
Dark Iron in BRD and MC
---
Ghost Mushrooms in Maraudon
---
Thorium in Dire Maul (east) (I'm sure there are more in DM, I can't remember them all)
---
Honor is the AV rewards. Raid gear is better in every way.
---
Your logic can be applied to so many things i cant even get into all of them.
---
But lets just grab an example from the bowl:
---
&gt; People are discouraged to play tank or healer because respec costs are so high. Removing respec costs or introducing dual-spec would fix that.
---
So you're saying Deathwing was a dentist? Nice
---
If you gonna make a math post, please read how vanilla hit tables work first?
---
&gt; It wouldn't be a big deal if it were going to be limited but these things have a way of persisting beyond the optimistic promises that they make in the beta phase. 
---
This is exactly the kind of shit John was talking about. They even tell us straight up what they're planning and some people in the community think they know better. Ion said straight up Layering won't exist passed phase 1 (which is when Kazzak and DM open)
---
&gt; If it is their players then why are they implementing a sharding system that will have a rotating cast of strangers coming and going from the player's perspective? 
---
It won't? Have you read how layering works? Yes there have been some bugs with it they intend to fix but you will very rarely see people rotate on and off of your layer.
---
&gt; Why are they not maintaining a static population amongst whom the player exists on their way to 60, sharing experiences with the same cast of strangers, acquaintances, and enemies? We did that in Vanilla and it was amazing.
---
They've answered this.
---
&gt;manually massage disparate populations within Clusters
---
Oh wow, **that's** your solution to layering? Please enlighten us all on exactly how this would work without being worse than layering in almost every single way..
---
Which one is wrong?
---
Its like weird how I envy gold farmers lifestyle and the likely envy mine.
---
I'm up to ep 17. These are ... interesting. Not very P.C., so I guess Scott didn't get 'woke' until after the iPhone came out and the world started chatting with each other, and getting outraged at everything.
---
I’d probably do most of the stuff once, but if the gear isn’t better than Naxx for ages then I doubt I’d bother to farm it. If most of it can be done in worse gear than Naxx gear it will probably be faceroll.
---
Feral tanks, not DPS. Bears are the best TPS tanks in the game.
---
Fuck if I know, I don't know shit about paladin, but that's what is said.
---
Imagine releasing a game in 2019 with graphics as shit like this.
---
It is a strange assumption to say that a critical hit can happen even if there is no hit.
---
Do you have reason to think so ?
---
Otherwise thanks for the study =)
---
Most people want to get it over with quickly. It doesn’t matter which AV version it is. It is a cultural change as much as a gameplay change
---
How many people are going to farm a raid so that memespecs can do ok damage? Also how does that impact PvP? Imagine Ele shaman with well itemised gear that is on par with Naxx. Would be absurdly powerful. 
---
There is already a PvP item that lets you go invisible. 
---
Your suggestions make this content worth doing once and then not bothering again.
---
Current game is not the same like classic will be. U will notice it from lvl1 on. 
---
You could play on a private server if u want to kinda get into it.
---
I no lifed pretty hard in vanilla and i only got rank 11 for the mount.  "fairly easy" seems misleading? Idk its been so long
---
🤯
---
Yes well if the above quote is remotely accurate, what the playerbase asked for would not carry much weight. Not directly anyways, only in so far as it was the best moneytary decision for the game.  
---
I'm a vanilla player, and a player of every expansion retail has released. I've made a number of a great friendships, ppl i even visit semi regularly irl, friendships decades long - I've yet to meet one of these ppl that wanted things like the LFR system. I'm sure their out there, but this argument feels so empty to me even so. As for the game getting bigger, you may want to recheck that statement m8. The games very much gotten smaller - peaking in wrath - and is now at and all time low i suspect (they stopped releasing numbers so who knows, but BFA definitely has an outright nasty amount of ppl quitting - i should know, my friends did, literally in waves per patch, and i eventually followed suit.)  
---
Hard truths, sure. Stupid truths, arrogant egotistic attitudes that are out of touch with reality, no not so much mate. That kind of logic is merely an easy thing to tell yourself about anything so that it aligns with your chosen narrative. The simple truth is that devs, corporate entities etc, are fully capable of and often are arrogant asstwats with no clue what their doing, instead simply being to big to fail.
---
wand /afk :D
---
Yes it can. The elites are really weak even compared to private servers. Archer range is also really short.
---
&gt; Are you saying for hunters, it works differently? That their crit chance is 20% of the 91% hit chance? That's not how I recall it working, but it's been a long time.
---
Correct. In 100 shots at 20% crit and 9% miss:
---
&gt; 9 misses, 18.2 crits, 72.8 hits
---
But since this is a raid boss, you lose 3% crit:
---
&gt; 9 misses, 15.47 crits, 75.53 hits
---
This was tested extensively using a debuff that increased your miss chance by 66% with over 34% crit gear. If it were a one-roll system, the combat log would only be full of misses and crits. Instead it was filled with predominately hits. I linked the EJ discussions above.
---
It's a kind of magic..
---
o rly?
---
The only thing I wonder about is of having a pocket healer all the time is worth the warrior negatives. I would have access to a priest healer basically all the time.

Your opinion on what looks best is not relevant to which animation should be in the game.
---
&gt; paladin

&gt; have actual abilities
---
Huh? Judgement can't proc the weapon. SoC procs can proc the weapon but afaik crusader yields more procs.
---
That's all a Paladin has.
---
Yeah it is and it will happen. Horde is disadvantaged in AV and their best bet is turtling.
---
It’s because it denies the reality of what motivates players to play the game. The original WoW devs knew progression of a character is central to an MMO. I would raid a new raid once or twice to see the new bosses, but farm is always boring without getting more gear and I’m not doing it so some fucking ret paladin can have a DPS set.
---
If you are a paladin and expect to not be buffing and rezzing, you will never see AQ probably.
---
People are different. It builds the hype for some
---
It is strange because it's flat out wrong. =/
---
Batgirl I guess.
---
We were giving out points for:
---
\-Being ready online BEFORE raid scheduled time (also means being at the start location, ZG for Buff &gt; Port to SW for Ony buff &gt; Port to Ironforge and fly to Searing gorge)
---
\-Extra Points for World Buffs (DM:Tribute, Songflower)
---
\-Extra points if you came with Flask
---
\-Points if you came with Potion+Elixir+Food (all class specific potions and food, this includes fire pots, arcane pots, everything. )
---
\-Points per boss kill
---
\-Points if you stayed entire duration of raid
---
We didnt give out points based on performance.  Mainly because we didnt have to, 90+% of the guild was competent and the content is not hard prior to AQ.  I can see you getting more specific once AQ comes out, specifically for people who get Nature Resist gear and are performing well.  But IMO the point of EP/GP is to get away from favoritism.  Is it fair that the person doing #1 damage in the raid gets more chance at loot &gt; therefore making sure he/she will continue to be #1 Dmg?
---
TBH I think we did fine with how it was setup, Also ALL tank gear was reserved.  We had 1 MT with Thunderfury, and 2 OT's.  Once all 3 tanks had their set pieces, then DPS warriors could get them.  Or if the Tanks passed for whatever reason.  I played as Fury warrior and I didnt mind because I knew it was for the good of the guild.
---
No, you just had to use the traps, conc shot. Let your pet aggro 2-3 mobs then burn them down. Pull aggro, just FD.
---
You just need imp blizzard which you can get as arcane frost.
---
They said it was removed from PVP and players stats, nothnig was said about monsters.

Well for progression raiding some specs will hold you back, like fire spec mages in anything before AQ.
---
I never said "paladins don't buff and rez"
---
/u/Zatetics claims that Paladins "spend the night buffing and rezzing", as if they do nothing else.
---
They do more than just buff and rez.
---
Attack speed is different but DPS is normalized. Faster attack speed is still good vs casters.
---
I'm not saying where WoW went was better, I'm just saying that the numbers very clearly shows that most people who played back then was much more interested in other parts of the game than world pvp.
---
There's obviously a group of people who are very impassioned about world pvp, and are gonna have a great time with it in Classic, but there's absolutely no evidence that points towards the general populace somehow not realizing how fun it is and that Classic is gonna turn into a massive world pvp fest.
---
Even on private servers, which hosts a very concentrated classic enthusiast community, world pvp is not in any way the primary activity for most people.
---
Having played retail from before MC release till the end of vanilla I just can’t see your statement as true. Vael is going to be a joke. 
---
I do remember wiping numerous times to him back in vanilla but since then wow players have had 15 years of experience. Back in the day the majority of players were *clickers*, there was no YouTube,  no fat boss guides, no twitch, no wowhead, we used to play on 800x600 tube monitors at 5 FPS if we were lucky(15 FPS if you zoomed in and starred at the floor) and on a shaky dial up connection with 300ms ping. Yet we still downed him.
---
Barracks internet? OOF

I was on Camp Courtney for a while. Cheers brother.

Something has been bothering me since the first classic wow stress test. Right after I started the game and went into character creation screen. The game seemed different. It felt like the colors or the lightning were off and it looks bleak (?). [Here](https://imgur.com/a/WbSuy86) is the link of a comparison. I used the screenshot from 1.12.1 vanilla client and the other one from Hazelnuttygames video where she played Classic beta (as I dont have access to beta). But I remember when I was playing the stress test, this was bothering me aswell. I was using "classic" graphic settings and game looked like it didnt had the right lightning effect. I tried to play with contrast/gamma etc but couldnt get it right. Has anyone else encountered this problem and a way to fix it?
---
Filthy casual
---
I'm no Classic except but I don't think the math is adding up here. I open l'm wrong though, good luck! I've got a new job a college starting August/September so ill have less time than ever :(
---
Calm down kiddo.  Math is easier to understand than an explanation.    I am sorry that you don't like numbers.  
---
It's been 15 years for us normal people.

damn that sucks. i was hoping for drawn out battles &gt;1 hour

You're probably thinking of a Tauren male hunter, for them the deadzone ends at 11 yards instead of 8. It was always like that.
---
Mirahs song is better anyway
---
Yeah, it sounds really good for alts and new players though. If they really don’t want to do BC then I’d love your ideas at least they give me something to do for a while.
---
Yes, extends everything. Larger model puts everything further out.
---
I, among others, who like a grand battfield with many factors having a role to play. Either it is the Ice lord, wolf riders, wing commanders etc. 
---
Objectives that mean something, unlike new iterations of battlegrounds. AV is/was unique in that regard. I'd like a 1.10 version.
---
Yeah I’ve read about how it spread the first time unintentionally. It’s just so amazing what happened afterwards, having quarantine areas, people healing non stop and it being picked up by scientists and compared to sars and other epidemics. I’d love love love to experience (or have experienced) that myself

I can agree with this. Was a little iffy about it since its all nochanges shit, but if people are gonna exploit this using the log out feature, might as well implement it.

Are you rolling Alliance or Horde? Gotta know the important detail first
---
I study physics I don't mind numbers, but starting a post about something that you clearly know nothing about is a waste of everyone's time.

Easy solution is make it like the payload mechanic in overwatch or tf2. Only making NPCs killable when it reaches a checkpoint near it
---
EXIT FUCKING GAME
---
It's not. Let me educate you since you're one of those people who is ignorant, but actually believes they are intelligent and thus are incapable of admitting when they're wrong.
---
Elitism is the inherent belief that CERTAIN individuals with intrisect characteristics, whether of status, abilities, racial, and others, are superior than others and that these people should be the ones allowed into certains echelons/jobs/groups of society. Your definition is stupid, by the way.
---
The initial post that you quoted and labeled an elitist did in no way claim to be superior or that others with different views should be allowed to play or into certain contents. They simply asked that people who did not believe in peak efficiencies simply stopped trying to gateway others. Insisting that everyone be allowed to play as they want. Which is pretty damn far away from elitism which would be more an opinion that goes as: "if you don't want to play the game efficiently, then you shouldn't be allowed to play at all." See the different, or do you need me to explain more slowly and with fewer words?
---
So, please, stop making a fool of yourself. You're obviously punching in a class lower than you're trying to. We have enough imbeciles/virtue signaling idiots running around and labeling everyone they disagree with as elitists/toxic/racists/bigots/Nazis. Now run back to your safe space.
---
I'm seeing this in multiple streams.
---
What the hell?
---
Sure ;) I also said, you had good ideas. Just wanted to point that out.
---
If something is 10 yards away from you, you have already failed at "kiting" it.

If you want honor or rep you will always want the fastest possible win. I dont deny AV is fun as hell but  after few weeks the long matches get boring for everyone and after the first hour nothing big really happens
---
&gt; "well everyone plays cookie cutter anyway."
---
The thing was the new talent system really didn't make people not play cookie cutter specs. Just to start, they ripped out all abilities that didn't belong to your specialization (so arms warriors couldn't throw on a shield in a pinch and start sundering for threat). So now everyone is required to play the exact same much more limited tool kit. 
---
[Take a look at Retail's monk talent recommendation on Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/mistweaver-monk-pve-healing-spec-builds-talents), that's a whole lot of no's and '???'s! I personally raided as a MW Monk and got cutting edge on G'huun, and I almost used the same talents the entire way from fresh max level to the G'huun kill. Another thing was that a lot of the new talents were *extremely* situational, and because it was so easy to respec you would just respec for the situational talent on one boss that required it and then switch back to cookie cutter right afterwards.
---
[Just look at the top MW Monk G'huun kills](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/19#class=Monk&amp;spec=Mistweaver&amp;boss=2122&amp;metric=hps), they all use the same talents with the only real consistent difference being was if they ran orbs or not (which required a situational talent). 
---
Solved cookie cutter builds my ass. It just made everyone more same-y than ever before.
---
SoC is an ability
---
No. Millions of people loved AV back in the day, myself included. You're doing the same stupid shit Blizzard did by uttering that lie.
---
So these "informed players" are correct and Blizzard's own 1.12 code is wrong?
---
Those collection quests actually have near instant respawn rates on the beta. So there’s a bunch of quests that would be skipped on the private servers but are actually more efficient in the beta as of now
---
Because you don’t reach kids or anyone who plays wow on tv anymore. No one has cable that is under 30.
---
Yes. Think of your model size as the circle around your character/target. The max melee range is 5 yards from that circle. The minimum shooting range is 8 yards from that circle, and so on. Everything is further out for taurens.
---
They are instant in the beta.
---
Love the Scarlet Crusade war idea.
---
I genuinely laughed at that. God damn it, I farmed enough herbs in vanilla to open a shop and don't even get me started on fire resistance.
---
Actually he was,  by saying "all you scrubs" he is putting himself above everyone else and thinking he's better than everyone
---
i mean most of the lightning and colour is completely off on the beta so I'm not surprised AV has it too.
---
I played AV after getting the mace, but it became very boring when the game ended before you could use wolf riders etc. AV has so much potentiall blizzard threw in the trash because of zerg fest's.
---
I was going to say India, given the references to The Jungle Book, which is set in India. Bhag'thera = Bagheera = Hindi word for black panther.
---
Why are you copying a post from the front page of this sub?
---
There you go!
---
Old AV sucked ass anyway. There was a reason it was changed.
---
wow!
---
No they literally just need to bring back the old AV that lasted for days. There was unironically nothing wrong with that, but 1.12 AV is ass.
---
They do, outside of specific abilities like pally Judgement and HoJ. Nearly every spell does.
---
That makes him arrogant, not elitist. Once again, educate yourself. Simply believing that you are superior does not make you an elitist. At least, not according to people who aren't idiots and don't make their own definitions of what words actually mean.
---
The only person here wasting people's time is you.   He asked a question, which included math for context.
---
RIP
---
Play the way you like, even if it's to press yourself to be the best.
---
Well they both are and aren't. A lot of bugs have been found from streams.
---
So as an hardcore raider in Naxx gear who mostly want higher stuff, would new tier sets at a similar power level would make you play the raid ? Just to have more variety and options even if it isn't necessarily better
---
New mounts with a low chance from the last boss ? rep grind with interesting comsetic rewards ? 
---
What other options would make you want to play the new content even if it doesn't have better gear in your opinion ? That's the main issue
---
He is arrogant but also being elitist by definition.
---
Burning Steepes is based off my bathroom after Taco Bell

Oof. Please tell that to countless morons you will inevitably play with lol

---
Yeah I get that. Just shows how petty we can be, iterations of flavour are somehow more vanilla than others. Literally sounds like people arguing "that cheap Walmart vanilla isn't REAL vanilla, this is REAL vanilla"
---
I already posted earlier that I'd support an older AV, simply because I wouldn't care for either of them. Only because I'd lose nothing to support it. And you get a part of the game you enjoy.
---
Druid: Feral is on a very fine line between being a meme spec and actually being viable which means people who play it gets shittalked by some but not all so they don't really know what's what. For healing they are based on HoTs but large parts of the game doesn't have enough damage taken that hots are neccesary so they have to spam healing touch where they get outsniped by all the other healers because their heals are slow. Oh and HoTs don't stack so if you bring more than 1 druid pretty much only the highest HP druid is allowed to HoT.
---
Nope. Your definition is wrong. Once again: educate yourself.
---
no, because if you were somehow debuffed to a 20% hit chance, that would mean every attack that actually landed would crit. 
---
hunters have a 2 roll system, melee one roll
---
scroll down to the ranged attack section
---
https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Attack_table
---
Feign Death is extremely wonky at putting you out of combat atm. Sometimes there’s a 1s delay between the FD and getting out of combat. This bug hurts hunters massively in PVP.
---
You have an obscure minority opinion. Most people loved pre 1.12 AV. It didn't feel too long or tedious at all, it was fucking amazing.
---
I'm torn.  I might make a brand new, same as the old one, Troll Shaman with the same name.
---
But I might start out with my Mage, which I had as a PvP alt way back in the day.  And if I start with my mage, I'm gonna name her something else.
---
Yeah, I noted this during a stream but was of course ridiculed. It seems like this beta needs more testing, maybe send me an inv blizz?
---
My definition is from Miriam Webster... good to know the dictionary is wrong and a random person on the internet is right, hmm
---
37 for Broken Tooth.
---
No, this isn't the AV that people loved. It had way more stuff to do, this is the gutted version.
---
Paladin tanks aren't viable in Classic. They have no taunt and mediocre aggro so holding threat is always an issue. They also lack good defensive cooldowns (as both bubble and BoP drop your aggro for the duration of the buff). You have serious mana issues, especially on longer fights.
---
You might be able to tank some 5 mans (undead instances like Strath/Scholo are best since you can make use of Exorcism and Turn Undead). But you will never tank anything in a raid.
---
/console ffx glow 0
---
Honestly I’d just want BC, I can’t think of a way to add new content without power creep killing game that people still want to do. Maybe a total break from the raid paradigm? New professions or something. 
---
I do like your ideas though and I feel sure a lot of players would play it. Certainly enough to make it sustainable.
---
You can be arrogant and elitist, since arrogange is inhirent to elitism.
---
You can, however, be arrogant and not elitist. I explained, very slowly, what true elitism is. 
---
I am sorry that you're not intelligent enough to understand. Don't let that hold you back.
---
People are rushing AVs on first version AVs on PS. If it's zergable people zerg
---
It was a good thing, because it was fun. They changed it for no good reason at all and the playerbase was very disappointed with the changes. AV became quite dead after the changes.
---
Yeah it was fun for about 4 hours. Alpha beta fish (guild I'm in) made a "KEEBLER DEATH SQUADRON" guild of all gnome rogues. There are like 10 of us.
---
Even then it only kept us entertained like half a day. Most of ABF is just on private servers til monday.
---
They really should've opened AV up to everybody and left regular beta up. The layering is still absurdly broken after 2 patches that affected it. They could def use more testing there. 
---
Also wtf hunters didn't get mounts, mages nearly have as much spi as int, warrs have a spi/int shield, every class is fucked. Except rogues...they gave us barman shanker lmao.
---
That's my favourite face too lol.
---
I had someone claim that there were millions of tweets about it. He never did link me the trending results he claimed to have saw.
---

---
Curious what data you’ve seen. Hunters had a hard time in 2006 and won’t be anywhere near the top of the charts come Classic.
---
&gt;Hunter. Hard to get into raids, pet agro pulls, called huntard.
---
Hunters tend to be under represented in raids.  Typically not hard to get in. 5 mans is a different issues. 
---
 Also, multishot can often hit shit you don't want to hit.  I once pulled Golagmag(big fire gaint boss) from the ridge above his home in the MC by hitting a trash mob with multishot.  Wiped my entire MC raid.
---
The goats have been pissing there for 15 years..

That's the fun part for a pally.

---

---
Also I know the definition, he was being elitist.
---
I'm sorry this hurts your feeling so much
---
Wtf is this colour? A bit more and its looking like tanaris desert
---
&gt;To pretend like anything more than an EXTREME minority didn't hate old AV is just revisionist history
---
Really dont want to get into an argument here, but I would ask you to consider that there exists other people than yourself with different preferences. Calling everyone that doesnt agree with your viewpoint an "extreme majority" is just bad form.
---
Most of the time you’ll sacrifice your pet for a damage increase, so much less of an issue with locks
---
Paladin has a billion abilities and still no buttons to press. Too much situational support stuff. You suffer through hours of dull gameplay (FoL spam/autoattacking) for a few situations where you can open your toolbox and get one of your gimmicks out. That got considerably better in BC and Wrath.
---
Warrior leveling isn't hard.  People just tend to do it wrong which does make it, very, very hard.
---
But that int buff!
---
Good luck "finding a corner" when there are 100+ others trying to do the same
---
Honestly AV is something that I don't think is fixable in a way that would return to the nostalgic classic experience of fighting in a single AV for days before it could finish.
---
Unfortunately this problem exists due to player knowledge more than anything else, a system was developed to earn the most lucrative amount of Honor from the system and that system was then adopted by what amounts to nearly the entire playerbase of how this particular system should be handled.
---
Basically AV is the way it is because of players and player knowledge and simply AV will likely never be what people remember it to be and that is unfortunate.
---
I'm leaning Alliance, but I have a large group and my biggest concern is keeping as many people together as possible. Feel free to add me and I'll know for sure by August which Faction my group is rolling.

BATTLE.NET: Durrian#1563
---
Why need pet when pet scales you?
---
My, you're a tall one!
---
Yes. Premades were doing sub-10 minute AV games in 2006 already.
---
If they do crossrealm BGs then they could give us both. But I guess that goes against the whole no changes thing. Even a weekend of 1.05 AV once a month might be enough to get most peoples AV nostalgia fix.
---
If you want to honor grind, you are forced to do AV. If you want pre raid BIS, you are forced to do AV. Better raid items doesn't change that.
---
Pretending like AV doesn't have huge implications on pve and pvp meta is silly. Has nothing to do with me wanting quick rewards. I was at my happiest doing world pvp with no bgs out, because I could just have fun pvping without worrying about efficiency.
---
Nope they are the same person
---
Dat climate change is real
---
Usually you get more honor from losing fast compared to winning slow...
---
If you go by the rates we all leveled at back in the day yeah, but if you proper minmax and nolife it, OP can definitely hit cap in that time.
---
Ideally they put in both versions...

I used to carry 4 or 5 green bows on nef. Swap over during calls, swap back after.

That entire paragraph was absolutely nothing more than pretentious fluff, and I bet he made a fist pump in the air after reading it out load to himself.
---
Yes? They were better. They were extremely fun.
---
I mean were not but at the same time I could go for that awkward period of time where people had the T2 armor before it became the T2 we know it as and instead looked like random world Green items until you inspected someone.
---
The training points are simply = (loyalty level - 1) x pet's level.
---
Loyalty levels range from 1 -  6' and all they do is reduce the amount you have to feed them to keep them happy (and dealing more damage). That means all pets at level 60 have 300 training points. Loyalty levels are gained just by having your pet with you and keeping its happiness up by feeding it. A certain amount of xp gain is also necessary to jump up to the next level. Usually by around level 18 to 20 you can have a pet's loyalty maxed out.
---
Also in regards to training pet abilities: You gain ranks of the basic stuff like growl, great stamina, natural armor, elemental resistances by just buying them from the pet trainers that hang around the hunter trainers. To gain anything else you will need to tame a beast with that skill and rank that you want, use that pet in combat for a bit to make it use its ability, then you yourself will learn that ability letting you teach it to your main pet. 
---
[This is a list of what beasts to tame to learn certain pet abilities](http://web.archive.org/web/20070228233117/http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/articles/skills_list.shtml)
---
Yeah i wont argue with that.
---
People are free to speculate though, and you can be logical and inductive with that speculation. Not every claim has to be treated like fact. If you can only discuss something by having complete and utter knowledge about it, we'd have very little discussion about anything :)
---
Or you could not suggest someone doing something illegal
---
Does that button actually work for anyone? I don't think it has ever stopped my flight early.
---
&gt; The #nochange zombies are part of the reason WoW retail went off a cliff
---
....the people not wanting changes are the reason why retail got too many changes and became bad?
---
im tempted by playing a lock.
---
this is pretty much my next video
---
The problem with this is that it's no longer "vanilla". It's "vanilla but not actually vanilla because lots of changes".
---
I don't see how anyone can read it and not feel the same gross feeling they do after leaving a Whole Foods; that disgusting air of smug.
---
And then you miss tranq shot and the tank dies. What do you do?
---
Or you know, that it's the boring version of AV? Instead of the fun AV from earlier patches.
---
I was talking about OP lol
---
If the leeway is the same as it was in vanilla then it should stay. This is something that you need real proof for other than "i feel like it's bugged". There's tons of footage of vanilla, if you really think that melee is bugged then go dig through some pvp videos and compare.
---
Double whooosh
---
Get bent loser
---
Why so toxic,  damn
---
I think you responded to the wrong person.
---
Hunter can’t shoot on the move anyways in vanilla so...
---
It's because 14y old ago everyone was noobs that didn't know how to play or what color snow have.
---
Hunters are “underrepresented” in raids because there’s only a handful of raid spots for them, especially later on.
---
So many retail punks are going to get burnt out here thinking they can rush this shit. 
---
Honestly mate go at your own pace or you're going to miss the fun of dungeon runs and the actual social experience. Saying that your own pace maybe a million miles an hour, and getting to that pinnacle of 60 (which seems to give nom vanilla players a hard on). When you make your first alt after you'll see the true joy in classic.
---
Say it takes you 2 months to get to a raid group, I dare say you'll be 2 weeks behind the gear process of raid rushers.
---
Blizz said that they dont want people playing retail will have to feel like they have to switch to classic just for tmog and achievements
---
Play on a private server to get your feet wet. Retail isn't even close to the same game.
---
There is 1 garunteed fadeleaf spawn in sm lib and 1 garunteed grave moss spawn in sm gy

Theres not much else hard about warrior. You just get camped leveling
---
Again,  why so toxic... damn
---
Good. Maybe the standard two weeks of people playing before population collapse won't happen this time.
---
Things have changed during the past 14(?) years
---
Streamers are helping more than anyone even just by providing video evidence of bugs. Look at blizz forums where most reported bugs have associated footage from someone's stream among the relevant threads.
---
I respect your opinion, but strongly disagree.
---
Jesus don't you have any other video games
---
Depends if we are talking world buff stacking raids or not.  Hopefully blizzard does something to stop that.
---
I'm being humouus. Don't take it the wrong way.
---
Hope for an open beta.
---
Yeah, it kind of surprises me the way Blizzard is doing this.. Apparently beta is going to be closing sometime in July? I expected them to just open it for every one either later this month or early July.. Surprising to say the least. Especially since I wanted to test my routes on Classic...
---
Doesn’t affect gameplay, just be grateful we are getting classic
---
I’m very worried about mages taking the few GCD’s to decurse the raid especially because decursive won’t work in Classic. A lot of people coming into Classic will have that “Always DPS no matter what” mindset and that’s gonna fuck over so many pulls.
---
We did, zoomer. It was not bs, it was fucking amazing and was not a problem in any way whatsoever. AV was by far the most popular BG on my server back then AV matches lasted 1-3 days.
---

It as always community driven. there has been a AV group playing for years on retail turtling and doing fun events - afaik its led by a guy called hydra.
---
the same will happen this time around. 
---
Most people will grind to exalted for rings, tomes, mace etc. but a couple people rise and do their own 3hour+ premade AVs.
---
&gt; I can agree with this. Was a little iffy about it since its all nochanges shit
---
It's not a change. It's simplifying a mechanic that was 100% in game.
---
- Alt F4 ... relaunch WoW.exe - log in - bam, dismount at next FP
---
- press 'dismount at next FP' button.
---
So what is the mechanic making them stronger? AoE with SoC? Im not sold on the idea that ret pally even with aoe does more than any dps class. And also, it doesnt work this way. Sure, they can heal if needed, but its much more efficient to have players that only dps and players that only heal, because you can squeeze much more damage/healing that way. Versatility is nice for pugs or random groups where you cant trust everyone 100%, but once you have a dedicated raid where everyone is assigned a role, it looses its usefulness
---
I bet everyone would want to be the Winter's Chill mage though :P
---
It's kind of weird that people are expecting AV to be amazing lmao..
---
I was telling you why I would watch it.
---
&gt;in the earlier stages of vanilla BGs
---
&gt;you'd be facing one of two T2.5/3 geared premades
---
Both of those raid tier sets were released at the very end of vanillas lifespan. T3 was released literally like 3 months before Burning Crusade.
---
I have no control over your sense of humor. I'm sorry.
---
thx for info guys.
---
It's not a sense of humor thing
---
You want some cheese?
---
They can. Back in the days, one of the 1st mechanics you had to learn, was kind of a fade away jump-shot, that means, you run forward, jump up, turn urself while still in the air backwards, shoot, turn still in the air forwards, and run away...
---
Bruh, have you seen a female Nelf running?
---
&gt;  It's like it was made by a totally different company than the one that made the original models. 
---
It actually was.
---
You think you want to play 24h av's, but you dont.
---
I'm doing Enchanting/Skinning myself for basically the same reasons. I want to use those low level enchants and hand them out to everyone. I'll be running with my partner who will be a Blacksmith, so I'm hoping his extra useless goods will help with leveling enchanting as I go.
---
Thanks for your answer :) one more question.... I'm playing kind of casual since I now have 3 kids and responsabilities so less time to play. Is it easy to gear up since druid is less popular?
---
Believe it or not, STV was actually designed after real jungles. Jungles and valleys exist all of the world, just google it.
---
Also, The Barrens was inspired by deserts which, surprisingly, exist as well!
---
Nah, he traded those for uncanny valley, stark-white teeth.
---
That is objectively wrong. The majority hated it. The majority complained about it. Blizzard listened, hence 1.12 AV.
---
If they had the option to play with modern models I would.
---
&gt; Africa has gotten a lot of help from other countries in the past half-century
---
They have also managed to regain their independence from certain "other countries" somewhat, and can now help themselves, which is probably a much bigger deal than the foreign aid.
---
Ive seen a lot of both.
---
That's exactly my point..you don't have one. When god was handing them out you were busy trying to get that booger that was just a but too far for you to reach.
---
The worst thing about this AV weekend is, that literally everyone is restricted to being in Org and yet, due to layering, it feels completely deserted. I think the maximum number of people I could see in the BG joining spot was 10-15. 
---
Bit disheartening.
---
Yeah this is definitely a big, no one should get these FPS in classic.
---
Some kind of hot tub time machine!
---
Same but imagine internally there would be a debate
---
There was a big overhaul when wrath came out, then it changed again in cata, then again in MOP
---
We all have different opinions. You prefer the new models and I prefer to be right.
---
1.11/Naax was released on June 20th, which was seven months before TBC. 2.5 came with 1.09/AQ40, which was a year before BC
---
If you have a pocket healer take a warrior, Warrior dps is great and the gear you get out of higher raids will really help with PVP. A warrior such a fun class to play and if you have a pocket healer they are wonderful the whole time. Even with shitty gear you can accomplish a lot with a warrior and a pocket healer. Grab yourself an ARCANITE REAPER and you will be able to pop people really easily in pvp.
---
I don't know.. A lot of people prefer to go be the 'Big Dick DPS' spec.
---
While it goes against the spirit of vanilla, maybe a free flight from Zoram'gar Outpost?
---
Touché
---
That 3% is actually massive lmao
---
Yawn, this sub and the game we are getting ready to play was built on the backs of private servers.  We are all going to pay Blizzard when they put out the product we want, calm down.  You can bash people that play vanilla private servers and not Classic when that day comes, but right now and for a long time, they are the only option.
---
It has limited uses, but items like axe of the deep woods and flurry axe are BiS for a long time for orc warriors, but those items are usually easily replaced for everyone but orcs. 
---
If you for instance play alliance, and get one of these, it’s worth a shot trying to sell it cross faction. Easiest way would be to join your server discord, that will exist of course, and spam the WTS section, that also will exist. 
---
I only remember/care about warrior stuff, but as far as I remember, most boe items that sell for a lot, are higher priced on horde side. Hand of Edward the odd for instance, is worth much more to a shaman than any other class. I’m sure there are some items that sell better on alliance side though.
---
No, hunters auto shooting while moving was added in cataclysm, and not even right away.  It was added in early 2011.
---
Pre 1.12 AV was objectively the best battleground in WoW history.
---
&gt;I made my opinion
---
No you didn't, you flat out CLAIMED "there is no way anyone enjoyed 10 hour long battlegrounds".
---
You're a pathetic baby. Most people aren't plagued by autism and low attention span, but you apparently are so you get all mad about a game not rewarding you with score screens every few minutes.
---
You haven't had a single valid argument for why long wars would be a bad thing. It was loved by most because it felt epic and it was very fun to be able to do non-stop PvP for as long as you wanted, instead of being limited to short matches and then queues like in WSG or AB.
---
There is retail.  
---
Also private servers didn't get blizzard to make classic, unless you count them squashing copyright infringement.
---
Or the US Midwest as well. Are you guys having a fuckton of flooding too?
---
LBRS/UBRS is under the dungeons tab ”Blackrock spire” now :)
---
I hate the horde but upvoted for the 69
---
There is a disconnect between shitheads like you whom sucked ass and those of us that enjoyed it in Vanilla. Keep spewing shit and enjoy corpse running.
---
Sad that you get so much opposition for wanting something that was in vanilla. So according to some of the asshats here if you want the oldschool mounts you're the reason retail is ruined and you're insane. Yikes.
---
Go back to BRs, manchild shit.
---
This sub doesn’t hate streamers, there is just loud idiotic minority.
---
We both are right. Autoshot won't work, all the others will.
---
Are there dinosaurs in that crater?
---
&gt; Also, The Barrens was inspired by deserts which, surprisingly, exist as well!
---
A bit too much vegetation in the barrens for a desert I feel.
---
AV isn't the AV people hoped for. 
---
It's 1.12 where npcs where watered down.
---
Maybe I remember wrong, from what I recalled there was a long Scourge invasion event in  1.11 and then Naxx coming months later.
---
Either way, 7 months and 1 year before TBC are still at the later stages of vanilla BGs, and you said " in the earlier stages of vanilla BGs". So this detail correction does not change the point at all, you are reminiscing about late vanilla BGs.
---
We must remember everyone that wants to play AV is in beta.  Why are you such fucking human shit?  Probably because you'll be a camped corpse for eternity.
---
Hunters have meh dps, and micromanaging your furrball is annoying.  Less bag space, because of arrows.  Nef breaks your bow too, lol.  Dead zone sucks ass, and easily exploitable by good players. 
---
Mages.  You are a vendorbot.  Messaged constantly for water and portals.  People don't want to pay either.
---
Paladin.  Healbot bitch that mostly spams 1 button.  Tank and dps spec is a total joke.  If you are lucky, someone might let you be the nightfall bitch.
---
Shaman:  Same as druid really.  You are not good at anything, except chain heal gimmick, which is only usable on a few fights.  If you are lucky, someone might let you be the enhance shammy, which is also kind of shitty, because all you do is auto atk and drop totems over and over.
---
Warrior:  Too op, so overpopulated.  gl getting gear
---
Warlock: Summon bitch.  Farm shards and summon lazy assholes.
---
You don't lose your best dps class.  You just have them use a slightly lower dps weapon.  2h fury is reasonable dps in a raid, particularly horde side.
---
I was so glad to read this potion of his book. I work in the industry and it takes a lot of willpower not to comment on the speculation I see various forums. In my experience, what he is trying to convey here is absolutely correct. That said, players should still voice their opinions and desires (respectfully of course) to help guide development.
---
World PvP in Classic WoW gives little to no rewards. All the rewards in battlegrounds, that is why players do battlegrounds instead. Same thing with Arena in TBC. If blizzard had made World PvP the focus and had objectives and resources to fight over, then it might have been different.  Arena /BGs were successful, due to a lack of competition from other PvP games at the time. Once League of Legends,  DOTA 2 etc.. were released, a lot of the PvP crowd quit WoW.
---
I'm not talking about the forums. I'm talking about the people I fought with and against in the pre bg honor days. I'm talking guild chat, bg chat, and just general in game chat.
---
And anyway, I was responding to someone who said those whining back then were just those who whined the loudest, which is why I mentioned they were the minority. It wasn't just the loudest people back then. It was a ton of previous world pvpers disappointed that the large scale open world battles were replaced with a pve fest that catered to the raiding crowd.
---
Retail is fucking garbage, get out of here troll.  If you don't think private server numbers are responsible for Classic, you are insane.
---
No, he's clean. Its the hardcore players that are filthy.
---
But you can rely on YouTube videos of 2006.
---
Blizz already said they had to retune a lot of the lighting with the new engine to get it as "close" as possible.
---
Even they shared direct screens comparing both original and new "close" post-tweak images that don't look 100% the same.
---
Get lost. Everyone already knows there are differences but we don't know the extent until we see them - like this.
---
It only works if you still have an available spot between you and the place you're landing. In addition, the cutoff point where you've "passed" a location seems to be super early nowadays, i'm not sure why. Haven't had time to play with it much in Classic during stress tests
---
Horde victories mean more than Alliance victories. Alliance is the easiest side due to imbalances that were never fixed.
---
Any chance we could see an entire map of Azeroth with your added zones in it? I'm curious to see what it would like like.
---
I used to live in South Dakota and never made this connection. Thanks!
---
but but but it's illugual!
---
I mean it's insanely stupid that it seems like they don't plan to open it for the public at all.
---
That’s not really true, during WoD he talked a lot about vanilla WoW on stream.
---
I don't. More than the Alliance I hate druids. Ever since the first one rooted me, slept my pet then proceeded to moonfire me in my deadzone.
---
those rewards at lvl 51 are a massive boost while leveling
---
Seeing the teams rush past eachother instead of fighting back and forth and pushing objectives makes me die on the inside. It's the most annoying, boring, soulless gaming experience I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing.
---
1.09 to 1.11 is earlier than 1.12. 1.09 is a lot closer to AV being released than it is to BC
---
well new professions would also have to be better and powercreep for them to be interesting
---
They had goblins and pirates they were working with.
---
That's just like, your opinion, man.
---
That is objectively wrong. The majority loved it. The minority whined about it. Blizzard did the retard thing, hence 1.12 AV - and the BG died very quickly after this. It got real fucking dead within a couple months after that, people no longer found it fun.
---
This argument "Because Blizzard did x thing, must mean there was a good reason for them to do so" is stupid, because if their decisions historycally followed any kind of fucking logic, we wouldn't have gotten the shitshow expansions.
---
Huh? I can’t actually tell if this is sarcasm or not.
---
Hello sir. It was a sarcastic joke. I thought that was pretty clear, I mean, it's the color of snow after all, lol.
---
They aren't better...
---
The new models in Retail are absolutely amazing lmao.
---
Most dps classes do fine once they get decent gear, dagger rogues are probably the worst, but even them do fine once they get gear. 
---
The only ones that struggle are prot warriors and healers. 
---
As for best class, probably hunter or mage, but all classes shine in their own way with gear.
---
For you. Either way it's you being a whiny bitch.
---
Ok sorry I made a claim and hurt your feelings. Yes private servers aren't 100 percent the same thing but I've done AV before and yes it's fun the first or two times but after in my opinion it's not good, and I know I'm not alone. Sorry my claim hurt you that much. I never said I'm sad that I  don't get rewarded or score screen lol. Sounds like ur the one that's fucking hurt that I maid a claim about a game. You are a fucking loser bud, keep crying and calling people retail baby's when people say something about classic. Keep defending classic with your life good sir
---
Video lasted 10 seconds for me. I hate it when there is 2 laughing monkeys talking over each other.
---
These gnomes are ugly af i would never ever play one
---
IIRC you can't get water untill honored and that takes atleast 2 7/9 clears. So rag won't be down for atleast 2 weeks.
---
He is wrong though. Sorry facts are facts.
---
We all have different opinions. Yours is unfortunately wrong.
---
Just respecc lol. Don't pick a class because you save some gold whenever you want to aoe grind. If you plan on grinding for a few hours or even days while you wait for raid lockouts it's not a hefty cost in the long run, if you are efficient in your farming that is. My guild is raiding on wednesday right after the lockout, and as soon as we finish i can respecc and grind between 2-3k gold until the next wednesday.
---
Why didn't you use your own trap, Scorpid sting and concussive shot?
---
Retail is actually good,  but that's neither here nor there. 
---
And show me proof that it was a bunch of people breaking the law that made classic a thing.  Cause they didn't,  and frankly should all have bans and not be able to play
---
You can't fairly reward 'skill and class knowledge'. If someone is incompetent, that's something you'd have to address, competence is an expectation. You can give points for dedication, like Backsight said, consumables buffs and such.
---
That makes sense.  I forgot SotC was 40% speed.  Also I forgot Stormstrike was such an insanely long CD.
---
You're watching level 58s in bad gear dude. At 60, with purples the commanders are going to be easy to zerg down. Even without taking down a single towe. And turtle games wont be nearly as common.
---
Like the majority of people here and on the forums...
---
"I am disgusted that this person tried to talk to me. How dare they interact with other players!! /ignore"
---
I hate poster like you so much. Trolls are fucking cancer. I don’t wanna see your post about classic. Ugh.
---
As someone who played durin .9 and .10, Ive a third one. Fights were happened near graveyards/bunkers/towers and people rarely fought in the middle.
---
We had one of our mages opt to being the Winter's Chill mage just so he didn't have to respec from AOE grind spec. So you could always do that.
---
Except that's true to vanilla and not a botched implementation.
---
If the respec cost capped at 100 for some reason it'd be in obvious need of fixing.
---
With multiple Manual Crowd Pummeller's per pull.
---
No, the majority complained, because it was shit. I played a ton back then and remember it quite well. In fact, I'm proud to say I was one of those voices.
---
haha True :P
---
Shutting down constructive dialogue??? This is a book about telling the DEVELOPER'S point of view. He's not saying "you guys should shut up because you guys never know all the factors at play", he's just observing that people would very often jump to conclusions which were obviously wrong from the developers' standpoint, but seemed to be right given what the public could know. It's interesting from a reader's perspective that even intelligent arguments were often way off the mark, which is why he has included this in his book. Not because he's trying to "shield himself" from the public
---
Omg why can’t we make the kids just log out like we did my immmmmersion....
---
So this means they wont be the day long AVs? Could log in the morning beginning of battle hope on later that night and be in same battle ground? Was that 1.7? That shit was awesome long but the victory or loss was much more impactful!
---
anytime someone ask "what class should i play?" just point them to this video
---
Except the current leeway is a change.
---
The troll left in 1.10. I'd say patch .10 was decent enough. You had long battles and you could send out wolf riders at least twice during an evening of play.
---
If we are making changes to AV, change it back the way it was in 1.5, don't completely change the game mechanics to something new.
---
Judging from your post, I bet your face is very punchable.
---
? sorry im lost. im saying candle is used to avoid any cd's.
---
No no likes you either.
---
If everyone with private server experience was banned from playing Classic...well, have fun with the 3 other people on your server, lol.
---
If that’s the dream you can always, you know, divorce
---
I love every time someone's auto correct makes Horde into horse. For the horse!!
---
I have to agree with NinjaNerd99, Enchanting as your starting profession will simply be a huge drain on you both in time and gold investment.
---
A Herb/Alch or Herb/Mine setup would earn you a significant amount of Gold making you transition into Enchanting much easier when you eventually do so at level 60.
---
Also leveling Enchanting at 60 with a large sum of gold saves you from repeating what is basically the most frustrating portion of leveling Enchanting.
---
The master trainer for enchant 225/300 Skill trainer and all the enchanting formulas are housed within the Ulduman Dungeon.  If you wait until 60 and prepare properly you can legitimately only have to make this journey only once or twice instead of the 10 or more trips I have seen Enchanters complete to simply max out the profession.
---
Take a took at that sexy taurens to. I hear what you say, I also have trouble grasping at what happened to Blizzard and if it even could have been changed. As long as money dominates all determination of value we will see it dominante our lives, loves, passions and capitalize on ourselfs.
---
As soon as AB was out pretty much nobody went back to AV. That's why they changed it in a later patch.
---
and they have paladins! :)
---
Sometimes it’s whored too
---
Yeah. I was recently asked to heal a dungeon but I was busy so I replied, "I'm doing something else right now sorry."
---
He replied, "Np, thanks for the reply."
---
Just that small response made me feel good about the interaction and if he ever whispers me again when I'm not busy I'll be sure to accept.
---
Couldn’t have put it better myself. Polite and to the point
---
No you haven’t
---
Satyr in Felwood are lvl52-54 iirc. I plan to plant my tent there and hardcore grind them at lvl52 until I hit 60.
---
Even if it's not optimal speaking of xp/hour, it is soooo worth when you consider the gold you can generate. Bonus if you're tailor.
---
Don’t now why this got downvoted either.... there can only be one number one. There can be many many specs with many many combinations of gear that are viable. But there will always be the best possible combination of gear and spec..
---
I don't see why anyone is complaining. It's really simple if you want to "PVP till you win" in AV. 
---
All you need to do is gather a decent sized squad from the 40 man and go back to back cap your own forts. This almost always ends up forcing a huge turtle war if you pull it off. It only takes 3-4 players to get a group ball formed.
---
Lmao you realize a ton of people who play live,  and those who don't play live or private servers, but are coming back for classic.
---
They should ban anyone who has played on a private server for breaking ToS
---
Are we not getting auto dismount?  Will still need an addon for that?  Lame.
---
World buffs don't help one bit but it's not like hunters are doing well in Naxx regardless. Nearly no upgrades since BW gear-wise, 0 scaling from pet/ammo, meanwhile other classes (especially casters) are scaling way better.
---
Absolutely. Dissatisfaction with a feature is not the same as assuming you know why a feature is on the table or not, and dissatisfaction or concern should always be voiced
---
I think my issue is that AV has so much to do. Gathering wolf's for cavalery, upgrading your stronghold, rescuing gryphon riders and send them out to battle or summoning the Ice lord. All of these things make AV so unique and most of the time the game is over before any of them get to see any play.
---
Sounds like you'd enjoy a Paladin healer. All healers are good, pallys excel at mana efficiency.
---
Plus Teleport! Level 20 is OP
---
parenting a new born &lt; classic wow
---
You got to go surv.
---
Great, you've made me puke all over my desk. Thanks for that.
---
That’s all I do and I’m 23
---
Well some tests have actually found the 1-10 mobs on Pservers not being accurate, as in they aren’t as strong on the actual beta. So that may help with leveling once it drops for real.
---
I tried out a pserver with an actual pop to see how long it takes to level. Following a guide, it has taken me 8 hours or so maybe 8 and a half to get to level 16. Starting fresh
---
Have you seen my post ?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0rogx/my\_take\_on\_the\_classic\_post\_naxx\_contentmassive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0rogx/my_take_on_the_classic_post_naxx_contentmassive/) 
---
I'm doing that but mostly focused on general ideas and content, i'm bad at making maps and how the areas/dungeons would look like which seems to be more of your speciality. Also I'd like to integrate leveling zones, I've mostly done end game content.
---
Maybe we could do some stuff together ?
---
True but the fact is at a certain point there is one build and combination of gear and race that will provide the most dps.
---
Just like a swingtimer for melee classes, you could keep track of your shooting timer and stop for half a second to shoot. That's how it was done back then.
---
This sub is a cancer, period.
---
Or was it a minority who complained and those who enjoyed it kept playing? That is the experience blizzard have now and why retail is on such a shot state compared to vanilla... because some people complained.
---
I was in a guild in BC and one time heard them badmouthing me by calling me a "Tryhard." Which I don't understand at all.
---
Whats wrong with my trying to build my character optimally and then play it well? We're wiping on the same bosses for hours every night when we raid, is that supposed to be fun? I thought the whole point of us raiding was to down bosses.
---
I mean I'm going to play a little more casually but that doesn't mean I'm going to try and be the best player I can when I do play.
---
Kiss good bye to that gold son.
---
It's not autoshot you fucking nitwit, read his post before replying.
---
Yes, taming Wolfe's, killing rams, upgrade guard with armour scraps
---
&gt; But this is an industry that bases their own success on subscriber numbers.
---
That's not really a good argument considering no MMO releases or talks about sub numbers. 
---
And even if that was true, the increase in expansion sales over time over 15 years say a lot.
---
It’s not about a single change being bad. It’s about recreating vanilla how it was.   Once you make a change here or there it changes a lot of things and opens the door for more changes.   I think that’s the basic idea behind it.  But idk.
---
/whisper asddgqetg
---
We're looking for a tank for SM Armory. You interested?
---
Sorry if I offended you by not liking your shit pve instance that is only there to make raiders who suck at pvp happy. Nobody worth two shits in pvp ever wanted to set foot in pvp, so fuck off
---
I like to imagine if this was handwritten it would have been with crayon, held full fisted, being pressed down with infantile intensity while sticking your tongue out to the side.
---
Why? Computer graphics stuff.  
---
Best guess? The Lighting and Graphic defaults/empty values are different in the current client than they were in classic. They mentioned this in a recent tech talk - The light of the lamps was super different in the two clients, because of the updates to the lighting engine since Classic. They probably spent a lot of time tweaking the snow to make it look good with the previous system, but then just chucking the modern system at it has some unintended side effects (in this case, yellow snow).
---
“We can’t kite and keep shooting our bow”
---
Depends how they do it. I played on a certain server whose names I unfortunately cannot mention due to dumb rules on this sub, but they had no melee leeway when the server opened.
---
The result was melee was just unplayable. People would be running right on top of you but due to the server processes movement in batches you could never hit them.
---
????? retail hunter OMEGALUL you get a swingtimer/autoshoot timer and stop ur movement for a split second to fire the shot
---
&gt;How else would you measure WoWs current state if it isn't for its active subscribers?
---
If we were talking about any other album, movie, game or franchise, would we talk about sales figures? That shit gets in the way of actual criticism. 
---
&gt;we are now down to 1.7 million subscribers as of last report. Idk man, but WoW isn't doing good.
---
Citation?
---
It was not like this on pservers AT ALL. You really think that all of these people are complaining just to complain? Players from top guilds (on pservers) think it’s ridiculous as well.
---
Meh I believe it will be different in classic. The private sever scene is considered more hardcore about min / maxing so a lot of the time they wouldn’t even look at off specs. I may be wrong but I’m sure there will be plenty of guilds that will gladly take one as long as you come stocked with consumables and really know the class well! Might wanna try that S priest dream out one more time! (:
---
The 1.10 version is good. No troll, no mines, but some normal npc guards patroling the roads to make the game feel live.
---
Nah use macros for your abilities and /cancelaura mountname,.
---
The most you'll use is 1 pummeler per boss.  When equipping a pummeler a 30 second cooldown is invoked before the charges can be used.
---
Your threat ceiling is quite high with 90 seconds of 50% haste, which allows your DPS to go harder.  There are very few fights in the game which are pure DPS races and also last more than 3:30 (most bosses like that have an enrage timer that ends the fight at 3 minutes.  So if you're using two pummelers, something has gone wrong.
---
Pummelers take about 5 minutes per Gadgetzan to farm and can be easily farmed solo at level 60.
---
No they cant. You have to be standing still to auto shoot in Vanilla.
---
I dislike streamers because:
---
The horde guys are always screaming and act in an autistic manner every 20 seconds.
---
The alliance guys act like they are Napoleon freaking Bonaparte, issuing silly commands from their high horse to the sea of dudes that follow them.
---
Both are usually incredibly aggressive and are just so quick to start yelling insults to anybody they disagree with.
---
Only cool guy is Esfand.
---
I have added you (titi)
---
I'd like that
---
also I've been trying to load your post all day, but it just gets stuck when I press the expand it just says loading no matter how long I leave it.
---
I too have discovered the ultimate Nightfall enhancement shaman spec:  reroll warrior
---
People don't like streamers because they were prioritized for beta, and don't really test like they seemingly should be. + they say dumb things time from time. At least SM will be completely bug proof because it's been run endlessly. Trying to pick apart the web of what is sarcasm, and what isn't, and who can't take jokes will cause you to permanently lose an IQ point
---
But beta is beta, that isn't the finished article either. I'm more aimed at retailers who want to actually play classic rather than stress test it.
---
Oh boy. Why do we have more and more people arguing things they don’t understand? What you are attempting to “correct” is at the very least phrases in a very misleading way but in all likelihood you are talking entirely out of your ass.
---
A hunter has many abilities they can shoot while moving and even jumping. Even their auto shoot can be fired partially while moving. The wind up animation only occurs when stationary. The cool down can be used to re-position/kite.
---
Lmao that guy is complaining about being forced to form relationships with other people in an **MMORPG**. Just play a single player game.
---
Yeah, I'll be corpse camped in alterac valley. Why are you here when you don't even know how the game works?
---
1.5 will not solve the zerg-fest. It is the player base that has changed. They don't want the long battles they want honor from the bg as fast as possible. 1.12 nor 1.5 is going to change that mindset. All that stuff that got removed is just going to be ignored as the raids run pass each other for the end goal honor. The only possible chance that long AVs would return is the complete removal of honor (minus pk honor) from AV so the people there are only there for AV and not honor.

---
If you left that last sentence off you might have had a shot at some discussions but you ended your post by stating your opinion as fact. 
---
There are potential reasons why your list could be good and also could be detrimental. But the thing is, if you want “classic” then you should get classic, warts and all.
---
Hahaha
---
Shadow priests are actually pretty good in dungeons. Multi dotting is very strong. The utility of being an extra ressurect and a magic dispel is also super useful. Like mages you will still have to drink a lot but your damage can actually compete with all the top specs in any situation where you can effectively multidot.
---
I concur
---
Is /dismount not available?
---
Odd that the polls that have happened since vanilla show that you are quite wrong.
---
I guess those too were “objectively wrong”?
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c11oql/healers_assemble_what_class_are_you_going_to_play/). 
---
frens: when you have a bud
---
Surv doesn't beat 20/31/0 or its variants if you're using your pet all, which you should. It also doesn't provide trueshot for the melees in your group.
---
alright cool I applied on the discord.
---
&gt; Apparently beta is going to be closing sometime in July?
---
Where'd ya get that information?
---
No thanks, I'll just have an addon like lazypig or autodismount, I'm sure there will be one.
---
Duelspec: Removes the choice of spec when you can do multiple things. You are in a raid and suddenly need more healers, oh don't worry guys I'm a boomkin but I can also instantly turn into a full fleteched healer. You remove all the identity of your character when you can constantly change the spec with very little cost.
---
Class/gear specific quest rewards: This already exists to some extend though? You have several choices of a decent variety. Sure it doesn't always fit your niece, but if every quest specifically helps you not only does it remove lots of the RP and immersion, but constantly getting upgrades like that is bad, and if they made items more rare to get then suddenly there's less greens, suddenly you impact how enchanting works.
---
Only warriors having a taunt: I see nothing wrong with druids having a taunt why wouldn't they? 
---
LFG: Removes all communication from getting a group, which is what kinda breaks the ice. I'm playing a wrath server right now and I almost never communicate at all with my group mates. Also by having the system find a group for you then your options are limited as a group leader, you can't make a balanced group, you can't make sure that you don't get a sublety rogue in shit pvp gear that only is there to get a pvp dagger(fuck that guy, did literally nothing in the dungeon until we kicked him). and so on. It creates so many problems and only solves laziness.
---
Sharding: Sharding sucks when it's noticed. When suddenly you are in a different shard with mobs everywhere or players all disappear etc. Sharding itself is meh, but when it becomes noticable, that's when it's really bad.
---
Graveyards means less death time less punishment for dying, and having even spread closely packed graveyards removes so much of the immersion in playing. Things like being very careful when you are in alterac mountains because you know the death walkback is super long etc. adds so much to the game.
---
Portals to cities makes mages less unique and the whole instant moving around thing again takes away from the immersion. 
---
Auto dismount when using abilities is fine really, I have nothing against it.
---
Also &gt; It makes the game more like TBC or WotLK, which were, by FAR and objectively, the best expansions.
---
Objectively up your ass. I happened to replay those two expansions right now while waiting for classic, and holy shit they are bad for oh so many reasons I really don't want to get in to right now
---
People on this sub basically complain just to complain.
---
Lets try a little exercise.  Put on your thinking cap.  What reasons can you think of that these things would be bad?
---
You're right. There are not enough cannons.
---
You're right, facts are facts.  It's the same experience as we have today.
---
nice bait tho
---
Dude you have no idea what you’re talking about. Big yikes
---
Downvoted for 69
---
You clearly haven’t played one
---
This has to be bait at this point. There's no way dude.
---
it is.
---
Thanks man! You have obviously read the whole post and given a good answer based on the post I made.
---
Thing is, classic is just as flawed as BfA. It's a 20 year old game and Blizzard barely knew what they were doing when they made it. The QoL changes improved the game up until late Wrath.
---
Arena was a horrible addition, though.
---
The more powerful windfury totem is very significant.  Also they should be your nightfall wielder.
---
That’s not true, we know and you’re choosing to be ignorant. Absolute idiocy
---
We sacrifice our pet specifically because they deal little-no damage lol.
---
Hunt, or be hunted.
---
I think it could be much more than only the scarlet enclave too, hearthglen is also not very used in vanilla and there is that part north of lordaeron which could also be scarlet crusade themed  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c09szr/what\_youve\_all\_been\_waiting\_for\_how\_northern/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c09szr/what_youve_all_been_waiting_for_how_northern/)
---
It’s gamebreaking
---
Dual spec:  Is a convenience that eliminates a consequence for making a decision and removes commitment.  A minimal gold sink is also necessary.  There should honestly be more.
---
Class/gear specific quest rewards:  These existed in Vanilla...
---
Only warriors having a taunt:  A great majority of raiders believe that TBC raiding model did it best.  But we have Vanilla, and thus must accept this poor design decision.
---
Looking for group:  The global channel worked well.  A teleportation auto queue removes the immersion of a living world with travel inconvenience and consequences.  
---
Sharding:  One world, one zone, one server, one community.
---
More Graveyards:  I don't think people actually care about this.  But long spirit walks are a consequence of wipes.  Consequences make games good.
---
Portals to cities:  Makes everything too fast.  It also provides an interesting class dynamic with Mages have that ability.  Tying such powerful transportation to classes increases the immersion and roleplay.
---
Auto-dismount:  I don't even remember this not being a thing in Vanilla.  It sucks, and is stupid, but for the sake of preservation, which ultimately is the goal of Classic, the game should be as it was then, flaws and all.
---
The problem is; where do you draw the line?
---
I'm not arguing with you, simply stating why some people would have an issue with it. Feature creep is real.
---
Arcane shot? Serpent sting? Conc shot?
---
Glad to see the spirit of classic wow surging through this sub
---
[*Can't Touch This* in Irish]
---
Yes, it does.  The melee can suck my dick.  I need to win the meter.
---
I've had a constant sub from zul'gurub until the end of legion. I haven't got one either but I had the satisfaction of actually playing it. To cut a long story short I just want people who haven't tried it to test it on a private server to have a sniff because some are not going to like it at all. Keep reading on here that people are planning this, pushing that and wanting to rush to 60..... It's not going to be the same and you don't need that willy wonka ticket to try it!!!!! It's there in a private server!!!!! 
---
Taste it yourself guys.
---
The whole thing is pointless it's comic books.  What's the point of your comment?
---
Portals to cities exist in Classic though, it's what makes the mage class special.
---
I remember in Vanilla I was leveling an alt. Grouped up with a mage doing quests/Deadmines. "Finally I hit 20, now I get pyroblast!" and I replied "You get blink now too." and he said "Yeah but it's not that useful."
---
Excuse me!?
---
And your opinion matters more, right? You guys straight hypocrites up in here. 
---
If this makes you not play rogue, good riddance. Too many of us.
---
Why so sensitive.... Damn
---
The internet isn't your safe space snowflake
---
1-Not having Duel spec makes your choice in spec actually matter and you have to pay up if you wish to change up your play style. 
---
2-Not 100% sure what this is suppose to mean, like everyone gets quests for class gear? More class quests would be nice but everyone having a WW axe type quest really takes away the uniqueness of it AND makes the gearing process while leveling more streamlined.
---
3-druids also have a taunt
---
4-come on now
---
5-sharding is straight up awful and ruins the feel of the open world
---
6-longer runbacks are a punishment for dying, not really very punishing when your gy is 2 feet from your corpse everytime
---
7-come on now
---
8-yeah thats fair, but hey that can easily be fixed with a macro
---
It'll definitely be that way for the first couple of raid tiers. Once everyone massively outgears it, *then* we might start to see some zerg (though 1.12 is still missing some of the worst retail changes in that regard)
---
I saw someone saying that the setting is still there and you can change it client side.
---
They were speculating that it might have something to do with the Chinese players you see in-game because they have strict laws about skulls and blood.
---
Not just mac dps, every player MUST top the damage meter or else they are dead weight being carried and will be dropped from the raid. 
---
Even healers and the tank must top the damage meter. Otherwise they're not weaving hard enough.
---
Only answered some but these are just quick answers
---
Dual spec - trivializes certain content if you can change between specs whenever you want. Also lowers spending costs which will make players not have to farm gold aka go out in the world as much.
---
Lfg-  this is just a big no. It majorly impacts the social aspect of the game if you just auto match with people and then can remove a player from the party and get a new one.  You are stuck with that shitter and will help him get better or never group with him again.
---
Sharding- also kills community and can be exploited for personal gains 
---
More graveyards- makes dying less impactful you shouldn’t want to die.  You should try REALLY hard to not die or guess what you’re walking for a bit.  It’s just part of the game and helps slow things down not everything needs to be super efficient or fast.
---
Portals to cities -  mages my friend.  Mages make portals. If you want a portal you gotta make friends or purchase one from other players. Again community.
---
  This is a game about community, hard work, and dedication.     If you don’t want to put in the time and make friends and actually have experiences you can make stories out of then you shouldn’t play.     If you are just unsure if these things will make for a good game I suggest you try it and hopefully you enjoy it. I know I will enjoy it.
---
Not sensitive,  just no sense in being toxic
---
a) players are only L58
---
b) there is no incentive to finish the bg (MoHs)
---
c) players have no endgame gear
---
d) there is no honor system driving people to honor grind
---
When this phase goes live, all of those things will be different and it will immediately be zergfests.
---
Yes obviously if it's not the way it was back then it should be tweaked. I'm gonna bet that it's another case of faulty memory or "this is not how it is on my private server" and if they go back and check 1.13 and 1.12 are identical.
---
Whiners would complain?
---
That's the point. Nobody wants 1.12 AV. The people who love AV want the amazing PvPvE experience not this crap shell of it. The people who don't like it and the people who just want marks/honour never will like it. 
---
Just untie it from the marks. Make the gear obtained from it cosmetic (mounts, tabards, cool trinkets, etc) and bring back the old version. Then we can see both groups happy. Those who hate it don't have to do it as they're not longer pressured for marks and gear. Those who love it get the version they wanted all along.
---
soo this is but isn't but is sarcastic?
---
Yea, honestly Nightfall is an odd trade off weapon - heck its something i've heavily recommended against to my fellow guild leadership if the maths doesn't add up in regards to casters vs melee's that we bring to a fight.
---
Now for my guild, we have a bit of a odd situation given that our plan is to run two support paladin's, a feral (offtank geared) druid and iimp warlock with the main tank.
---
Though the theory behind that is to augment as much of the tank's block damage with holy damage to enhance them while also having two dedicated supports to cover off healing and emergency LoH etc.
---
So I shouldn't play to the best of my abilities? I should just play lax and not care about how well I do?
---
I think not.
---
Great suggestion! Thanks!
---
So what do you even play?
---
Yes you have, because that means it's inside your deadzone.
---
Oof sorry you're being used by a cheater.  Sucks to be you.  You don't want that one move on.  She can't even write!
---
What? Maybe the classic team does, but the retail modern team is basically a black box.
---
Did they change that in Guild Wars 2??? I don't have that on my end. I played a while ago (Launch) and I believe I remember then it was a thing, but I have not had it now.
---
&gt; Only warriors having a taunt 
---
Feral Druids right now- Am i a joke to you?
---
You could do that in wsg/an. The wheel in AV would keep turning even if you left.
---
No it is not as flawed as BfA. It just had a different inspiration. 
---
Classic was inspired from games like Everquest and FFXI, and BFA has been an iterative process inspired by what they thought would keep their subscribers. Classic was also a single game where every zone was designed to work together in unison to give you a very specific experience. BfA was designed with BfA in mind but all the content that came before it is essentially dead or dying due to the way they handle expansions. This has been the same story since BC
---
I downvoted you. But I don't want you to think it's because I don't appreciate sarcasm. It's because you clearly learned the definition from one of those "word a day" calendars, and decided to cram it into seven run-on sentences as many times as humanly possible. It's because it was damned difficult to actually comprehend what you were trying to say. It's because making random troll comments (like your snow example) is NOT sarcasm - it's just being a troll, and not even a clever one.
---
That was painful to read.
---
Well Classic isn't supposed to emulate whatever private server people play on, it's supposed to be authentic to 1.12 which it probably is.
---
Feral dps isn’t horrible. They get a bad wrap for tanking, but that’s because there is no good feral tanking gear until AQ-Naxx.
---
I feel like people here just don’t realize ferals can tank just because they can’t do well (do horrible) with pre BiS MC, or even MC/BWL gear. So most people think of them as a “oh fuck all of the tanks are dead, hopefully our hybrid feral can survive another 20 seconds”
---
A naxx geared feral tank is as good as a warrior tank, even better for AoE tanking. Change my mind
---
Don't worry, it's normal. Gaming subreddits are full of heavily substance abusing americans who have a hard time processing sarcastic posts.
---
&gt; The more powerful windfury totem is very significant.
---
....no it's not? The AP bonus on Windfury Totem is negligible. Not enough to offset the enh's awful DPS.
---
I'm going to steal this...I'm sorry in advance.
---
I think Towilee had a 9hour one last night. The games still go forever if people turtle - ie defend. If people want fast games they don't defend. So it's completely up to the players how they want the game to go.  
---
   
---
Essentially what the people that are complaining we are getting 1.12 AV are saying is they are scared that their minority opinion that games should take forever will be overruled by the majority of players come release. If it was actually a majority opinion every game should go for 12 hours then every game would still go for 12 hours with 1.12 AV.
---
People lie.
---
But that is Slippery Slope fallacy
---
Had to turn off because ADHD kids
---
Awesome write up. I love stories like this!
---
Here's an idea, don't burn yourself hoping for beta access anyway... 75% of you will never report s bug even if you get in anyway, waste of time.
---
&gt; It feels too much like their similarly forced spell-batching.
---
But we're the ones that forced them into doing spell-batching in the first place. Some private server hero created a thread about it and then the entire community rallied behind it.
---
And let her have half of my assets and give her power over when I get to see the kids? I think not.
---
It only became a problem once marks of honor were made important. Otherwise there was really no problem with just dropping after a few hours if you got bored.
---
i mean we're in our thirties...
---
Not newborn, 8months, but nah i will basically only get to play when shes asleep!😅
---
Great argument.
---
Yeah the nochanges crowd will gleefully kill this game if they get their way.
---
You have my full permission to paint that image of absurd angst on all who it applies to.
---
&gt;warriors: "Yes"
---
You should check out Kevin Jordan on twitch
---
I like the old models as well.  I can’t bring myself to play new orcs they look bad to me.  Same with undead.
---
I played both.  The deciding factor is probably if you enjoy form swapping or not.  I preferred shaman because i rathered have all my tools at disposal in one form.  But totem management is bleh.  So up to you!
---
Yeah back in wrath you could stand and walk on it, albeit a little more to the left, by mounting + jumping at the right time with a mammoth mount.
---
I swear half my time spent in wotlk was doing stuff like this lol.
---
Definitely wasn't this easy tho for sure.
---
You would have to be pathologically delusional or mentally retarded to judge someones intelligence of knowing or not knowing about a  random video game mechanism. Anyways something like this should be fixed if it indeed makes kiting for any class more difficult than it was in vanilla.
---
Sadly they gave us the heavily nerfed 1.12 version. If it had been 1.5-1.7 it would be very different.
---
Thank the fucking gods.
---
&gt; It is the player base that has changed. They don't want the long battles they want honor from the bg as fast as possible.
---
We know.  That's why we have 1.12 and not 1.5.  
---
&gt;  The only possible chance that long AVs would return is the complete removal of honor (minus pk honor) from AV so the people there are only there for AV and not honor.
---
I wish it was like that.
---
&gt;You really think that all of these people are complaining just to complain? 
---
Yes...? Three days ago there was a thread complaining about how BROKEN melee leeway/range was, and it was upvoted. Too bad it was just a delayed windfury proc due to the way animations worked in Vanilla. 90% of that thread being **dead wrong** didn't stop them, now did it? No, because complaining is cool, and people don't correctly remember anything (Blizzard having to create an official **THIS IS NOT A BUG** thread is proof of this alone).
---
Good players are complaining about melee leeway being weird, not hunter deadzone. You can test the **correct** hunter deadzone, **which is 5-11** on pservers right now. People think it's 5-8 because that was the displayed number, and no one's going to notice a difference of 3m when everyone played with 300+ping. The fact of the matter is combat reach **added on top of that 5-8 number**.
---
u/Snelhest3 describes it well:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzl6dx/tauren_melee_range_is_broken/equxjy3/
---
In short, yes. Especially, on fresh servers. Play it well and you can be slightly behind fury dw, which imo is worth it just because of the aesthetic of hitting with a massive weapon. 
---
P.S. Viable means possible I think you mean optimal.
---
You should see my notes file. 20 years of interesting things.
---
This is a big issue for mages indeed.
---
Classic isn’t vanilla either.
---
He probably ment that Blink wasn't very useful while leveling. Yeah its good for mobility, but if your grinding mobs and blink in between every kill you will go oom faster and reduce your exp gain efficiency.
---
This exactly. As far as I know, nobody has tried doing a 60 grind using primarily dungeons from launch. When the game first came out, nobody was skilled or organized enough to pull it off. Mages didn't even have instacast arcane explosion back then without an arcane talent dip.
---
By the time 1.12 came out, there wasn't any questing congestion any more so most people just quested like normal. Less need to organize a dedicated 5-man.
---
I don't see any reason why this couldn't be done at 1.12 release day at RFC from lvl 14 onwards. I wish I was on beta so I could find some folks and try it out. Does anyone have any info or streams with XP/hr intel from early level dungeoneering?
---
I'd go back to horde simply because Thrall was in charge
---
LOL i mean they are great 3rd tanks and dungeon tanks.
---
I’m talking about melee leeway as well, not the hunter deadzone...
---
What? You serious? Their goal is to create an authentic classic experience. The old stealth walk is a part of that. 
---
So yeah, the old stealth walk should return.
---
Oh yeah, the new animation looks terrible.
---
I really wonder why they considered this
---
... Melee leeway has nothing to do with the hunter deadzone, nor anything to do with what I'm talking about.
---
So...
---
Because whose to say what changes should be made and which ones shouldn't be? This group wants duel spec but no portals to cities, but then this other group wants portals to cities but no duel spec, then this other group wants LFG but doesnt want duel spec or portals to cities. If you're blizzard which group do you go with? How do you determine which change has validity and which ones dont. You piss off way less people by making no changes.
---
Any update on this? I keep checking back. :p
---
nah, the only priority spell worth buying here is conjure water (rank 3)
---
Well, it only makes sense that they're going to close the beta in July since that's the month before release.
---
You end the supply of Beta and it'll create a larger demand for the actual product.
---
yeahhhh thrall!
---
It's the closest we can come to it. That's the point.
---
The entire point of Classic is to preserve vanilla / 1.12. Adding new content and changing up the game completely goes against that.
---
If you want changes and new content, retail is that way ----&gt;
---
I played guild wars 2 at launch but I don’t remember. I had pretty dopey internet when I played the first Guild Wars though so I definitely saw it there, lol. Doing a Droks run just to unknowingly get stuck behind a boulder and killed
---
You know this is a damn old copy pasta. But I still like it to this day. It‘s freaking stupid but damn it reminds me of my teenage years scrolling trough wow forums 😂
---
Do you feel the need to act like kids for the teen YouTube audience?
---
You know there's a post exactly like yours on average 50+ times a day? And that everybody hates them and wouldn't even engage it since the game hasn't even came out, and that posts like these are basically seen as spam here?
---
Never go to Vegas.
---
The old models are awful and do such a terrible job at representing the races. It is a joke almost. Like they were designed by somebody who had never even played Warcraft before. It makes you really wonder. You act that just because the graphics have more polygons in the new models they are somehow better. They don't belong in Warcraft and don't artiscally represent the game at all.
---
The lossless version of this file is probably at least 300mb, the PSD or similar is probably 2-4 GB.
---
Yeah, and it's going to inspire so many spin offs. It'll inspire counter groups meant to hunt down and destroy the Ooga's. Community driven gaming is always the best, because it leads down a path that no one ever predicts.
---
&gt; So this means they wont be the day long AVs?
---
Pretty much. The cause of day long AVs was the insanely powerful commanders meaning a rush was guaranteed suicide. By 1.12 the NPC damage was nerfed so massively that they can be handled pretty easily, so the meta just because rush Drek/Van which is how most AVs will go now in Classic.
---
Int buff, shmint buff.
---
I’m all about that [Escape Artist]!
---
Imagine having a macro spamming everyone instead of using a LFG tool that does not bother people 😂😂😂
---
Dual spec would make the game fundamentally different. Spec changing is so expensive for most players, that it is a huge limitation and thing to work around. Also note: Earlier raids are not hard. With Dual spec, the earlier raids would be trivialized for a guild full of people with a straight raiding spec.  
---
Class/gear specific quest rewards: These exist in spades while leveling. and AQ. And tier gear exists. The only change here that makes sense is stopping Shaman drops for alliance or Paladin drops for Horde.  
---
LFG: No. This is a huge social killer aspect of the game. This is a huge part of the criticism against WOTLK.  
---
Sharding: The better solution to this is to lower the server population closer to classic levels. Sharding is a less good solution to the same problem.  
---
More graveyards: When Classic came out, it was criticized for being too lenient on death. The sparse graveyards add to the pain of death, and that pain/reward structure is a vital part of the game.  
---
Auto dismount is fine - macros can provide the same functionality.
---
The old animation doesn’t ‘connect’ with the ground though. The character basically slides and makes it look tacky.
---
How many pets can a hunter have? Will there be stables in classic? If you leave a pet in the stables does it lose loyalty over time?
---
Which is one of the big reasons people are no changes
---
One thing I've done before is play on a private server but sub to Blizzard during that time even though I wasn't playing retail. How do you feel about that morally?
---
you are 100% right. I have been saying this as well. What is going on with the lighting in game?
---
Fortnite mostly.
---
lol, jk.  Idk, I am having a really hard time figuring out what to play this time.  Last time I was a resto shammy.
---
beside your post, legit questions like this getting downvoted show how terrible this sub is lol.
---
1. i dont think it is that big of a d0eal, but it does change the dynamics of the game. maybe if tanks/healers could respec to dps to farm, it would lower the amount of ore/herb farmed. Just as an example. It is hard to tell the impact of such a change.
---
2. the wonky itemization of classic was definitely part of its charm. It added a lot to the feeling of you deciding how best to gear your character rather than following a predefined path.
---
4. Honestly I don't think lfg TBC style was that big of a deal, but I never used it too much, it wasnt that common on my server to use it. I wouldnt miss it for sure
---
5. sharding at launch is understandable, later on it has a big gameplay impact. world bosses, rares, resources are a big thing in classic, that would be impacted.
---
6. lower impact of death makes the world feel less dangerous. Also impacts wpvp over resources/world bosses etc.
---
7. again with the wpvp argument, getting around takes time in classic, and this has an impact on gameplay. when two factions are fighting over the same resources, it does matter if getting from a to b is 5 mins or 15.
---
8. nbd
---
Okay yeah apparently I lose my reading capabilities in the evening
---
they look technically good (except gnomes, wtf?) and i think the main purpose is so they'd look like they fit in the same game with the new expansion content, but they all look the exact same. 0 meaningful variation between faces from what i remember. the new models look "safe", as if someone mandated that the faces all have to be aesthetically pretty regardless of what they looked like prior to the update, ultimately stripping away any personality and coming out with the same face syndrome. it took out a lot of the fun in character creation
---
Personally I'd like UI fixes, things like tabard, mount and pet tabs and so on (not shared between characters) as well as things like colour blind modes.
---
Essentially things that do not impact anything except the UI of peoples games, this was a button that replaced having to log in and log out. It doesn't change how you play the game or anything so it is fine
---
Pretty sure he was jerking himself off at the same time
---
&gt; Please give me beta Blizzard
---
You racist pos
---
Oh he's fighting with them alright, just not on the same side! you can see him swinging his mighty axe at the foolish humans in front of him. xD
---
I was thinking this too. Also, I'm almost certain druids have taunt. Also there are class gear quests. Level 10 rogue dagger I remember. Whirlwind axe warrior I remember. Half his post is about things that are actually in the game.
---
Clearly, shamans need a taunt
---
Or, I was given a boost, an litterally cast 10 spells before being given an artifact weapon
---
I love that face.  Ganking with a smile, horde will love you.
---
Pummeller is like a 40% drop rate and you can farm at most 5 runs per hour.  Gonna be really fun for horde druids to try and farm it.
---
Log out and back in, it stops your flight at the next junction.
---
So accurate it hurt.
---
Has nothing to do with morals,  it breaks ToS and you should be banned
---
3 - 1 Active and up to 2 in stables
---
Ah that makes more sense.
---
This was a consequence of Marks of Honor, rather than BG design.
---
1.12 AV can be stalled forever if the Horde want to.
---
There's a reason that people are afraid of that mentality. In vanilla, unless you are in the best 1-2 raiding guilds on the server, no one was a try hard douche.
---
In today's retail, seemingly everyone you run into is a try hard douche.
---
Despite your memeing, try hard mentality has the potential to imo literally kill momentum for classic.
---
Will it be the oldschool throw forward blink or the teleporting blink?
---
Shaman: no hard CC
---
In the mirror American Psycho style.  No woman to record, just himself, and his authority.  It revs his ego engine goo.
---
you are a wizard harr...gnome
---
Does minor boost enchant stacks with cheetah aspect ?
---
Yeah Druids at level 20 would like a word. Catform is such a gamechanger
---
Stoneclaw totem- Am i a joke to you?
---
Considering there wasn’t really gear for things like Arms/fury warriors, and other classes all got put in the same spot, that would be An excellent way to balance out new content.
---
I suppose that's true, its much more useful in a PvP setting. More useful than Pyroblast I'd say though.
---
Leveling my mage I made use of aoe grinding and would use blink to get distance after frost nova before they could break out. So I found it useful during leveling as well.
---
Ez new desktop wallpaper.
---
The same way you level a main.
---
https://youtu.be/5ISdx2wjH4E
---
I recommend you finish the series.
---
I think there is actually another subreddit that is about this topic. Classicplus or something.
---
Basically why bother,so prot warr or druid it seems
---
What makes you think Annihilator stacks?  Some shitty private server with 0 armor and Sunder+Expose armor stacking?
---
Approximately how many times have you blown asmongold would you say?
---
I know the human in red armor is supposed to be Iron Man but that is SO Magneto!
---
Yeah no I'm a serious wow player and want to join a min/max guild
---
But the point is at what point do you decide makes the *build* optimal?  
---
At Naxx BIS?   At Preraid BIS?   
---
That point will move depending on where you're at in progression in your guild and what drops your guild has received.  
---
A spec is only optimal within the context of a set of available gear, really.  If you're deciding on a spec before going into a raid, there isn't really any advantage going with swords vs daggers (Except for the fact that Dal' Rend's is a better set for swords than what is available for daggers).
---
I hope you never get your way, it would ruin classic.
---
Now it's 96...
---
Yes to all of this.
---
Casuals guilds very well may, devoting hours a week to clearing each raid once you get to AQ and Naxx is a huge investment and I doubt many of those guilds will carry people who don’t come prepared. It really doesn’t take a huge amount of additional time per week. Now if you add the time spent farming gold or mats for consumables and the time spend farming gold for PvP respecs and PvP consumables you’re talking about a lot more time.
---
Add-ons solve most UI problems.
---
Colour blind mode will be included. It's running the modern client.
---
In my understanding, if it existed in vanilla, it will exist in classic.
---
Most efficient?   With rested bonus.
---
Such a good face for PvP trolling.

---
As a previous guild lead, the "pulling rank" for loot is a big no no. I've seen this create such huge and toxic issue various times, that it's not even worth considering.
---
Being stuck on regular mounts alone must’ve accounted for at least an hour of the battleground.
---
Yeah I feel the same way 
---
I almost want to level my first toon to 60 just to be a money maker and get rich AF early and work on the classes I enjoy playing later on the game
---
&gt; There's a reason that people are afraid of that mentality.
---
And what's that reason?
---
I haven't tested it, but I'm pretty sure no movement speed increase stacks. It use whatever movement increase is the highest at any given time.
---
Way to be a dick. 
---
Of course it changes it, that’s why people are discussing what they want to happen after the game has been around for a while and a lot of them want a OSRS type thing. I’m one of them. 
---
A large chunk of the classic crowd aren’t just wanting vanilla back, but are also unhappy with the directions they went in subsequent expansions. So we see this as a potential fresh start. I don’t care if they wanna have a vanilla only server in addition to an OSRS type thing. 
---
But you don’t care about nuanced conversation you just care about being a #nochanges asshole.
---
*Billy Madison voice* "Stay as long as you can!"
---
&gt; really cheap ... 200/year
---
How many homes are in your neighborhood?  What does that add up to and where does all the money go?
---
I just hate the idea of it, you know? It's like getting double taxed -_-
---
I had this same question at launch when I dinged 60 on my combat rogue and began applying to raiding guilds. 
---
I will never forget the advice the guild leader gave me after reviewing my application. 
---
The best way to get into a raiding guild as a rogue, is to start over as a priest.
---
It's the act of selling a character. Same as Dr. Disrespect but not at extreme.
---
It's like those people going on and on about NE having more base agility than dwarves... Who cares.
---
Ive seen this arguement a few times now and I honestly dont understand. A few QOL changes doesnt hurt the social aspect of Vanilla or remove anything from the rpg elements of the game. Ask yourself does this change make the game more antisocial? No. Does it make the game less immersive? No. Would it make the game less annoying? Yes. Then implement it. Where is this unclear line? Its quite well defined in my mind. Does having to log out to stop your flight path make you feel more immersed? I need examples of a feature that would be a grey area.
---
Yeah, tbh having to constantly place blessings/totems was actually fun for me. I just need to pick between horse or alliance it sounds like.
---
Why would I argue. Theres this exact post every single day multiple times a day. Its so fucking tedious at this point like we fucking get it dude.
---
Pick any of the hundreds of threads that get made requesting the old AV.  It was much more fun there's no doubt about that, but it also meant that unless you have upwards of 8 hours straight to commit to one single game, chances are you weren't going to see the end.  I think that was the biggest problem from Blizzard's perspective, the games just took too long.  Definitely more fun though. This is my opinion having played AV to exalted on 4 different characters in Vanilla.
---
I heard the XP you get from dungeons with a level 60 in the group is very subpar. Is that not the case?
---
It's not on the launcher, and you don't have the beta.
---
No one has claimed guilds won’t bring one ret or one feral, one of those specs can be viable in the sense that they can bring buffs other Druids and Pallies can’t.
---
The idea that anyone can play whatever meme spec they want in raids and the bosses will just all die because they are classic bosses and it doesn’t matter  what raid comp you bring is complete nonsense. If you’re lucky enough to be the one ret or feral in your guild more power to you. I wouldn’t go into classic wanting to raid with a guild with the intention of being a meme spec unless I knew the guild leadership because you’re likely to get sidelined more than you would be if you actually play a class/spec that is optimal
---
Damn, Best not play classic then!
---
Hi, /u/Hoofootwow

---
It won’t be as useful to the majority because you can’t have alts on the other faction in vanilla.  So you’d need a second account if you wanted to move things yourself.
---
It is pretty useful though.  Especially if you get a good boe you can post on the forums rather than putting it in just your AH.
---
No. What you can do in a forum Vs in a court of law are two complete different things
---
Yeah. I would be hella frustrated if that happened. I actually seem to get most of my problems network wise (Even though I have good internet) in WoW.
---
Other players have the option for classic in their launcher, it just grays out and says "you can't play Classic WoW yet"  
---
That isn't even there for me.
---
You know what I mean: The population of people logging in dropped massively leading to huge queue times.
---
Tauren deadzone is massive in classic. It's a huge disadvantage for hunters.
---
I mean, power leveling and efficient leveling are two separate things. The most efficient leveling is only playing it every three days to work off the rested XP, aoe farming priority. Not playing if no rested. 
---
Power leveling you'd probably have a 60 rush you thru low dungeons until the 60 hit a point where it was time consuming for them to do so. Maybe SM. After that, probably having you aggro big groups slightly above your level, drop an aoe to tag them all, then have your 60 friend out of group nuke them.
---
You can realistically give up 2% damage. Not the end of the world. It's obviously worse, but not spec breaking.
---
If it needs to be explained to you, then there's no changing your mind.
---
You don't need to agree with or understand the argument. Just understand that people like different things.
---
What is a bitmask?
---
Look at how you’re talking to this guy because he doesn’t want to play a 45 hour bg. Human shit? For real dude? I played classic since literally the day it launched right up until wrath. The old AV was ass and ****nobody**** liked it. It was a low reward, ridiculous investment BG. You couldn’t even fucking finish an AV when it released unless you had a day or two off (assuming you work). There was a real reason they changed it and it wasn’t cause ppl wanted ‘fast rewards’. Wow dude it’s so epic getting three shot by fucking tower archers for 8 hours!!! New players just don’t understand!! 
---
Just drop it dude. This whole vanilla elitist attitude is a joke. I’m a day 1 player and i played all of classic. Not everything was better back then.  Especially AV.
---
Ok so you don't want a pally tank then.
---
Refresh me on the landmines thing?  Where were the landmines in AV?
---
Its invite only. Not everyone has the beta.
---
Confirmed. This is how we pick up ran Strat for the dungeon upgrade gear items and later Mechanar and magisters terrace heroics
---
&gt;not continuing your bloodline that has existed since the dawn of biological life on earth is an "advantage"
---
Sure, if youre a hedonist that wants to die alone lol.
---
I'm so glad my religious, reactionary self has already( in my early 20s) managed to outbreed you nihilist dead ends lol.
---
&gt; It is a shitty bg that everyone hates  
---
Nope. I loved it. Stop trying to speak for everyone.
---
In my opinion you are looking at the issue in too much of a black and white lens. There are different degrees of breaking ToS. Someone wanting to play a version of the game that Blizzard hadn't been providing is different in my mind to someone griefing other players or hacking the game. Why? Because the intent isn't malicious.
---
You do realize that Blizzard literally invited people from Nostalrius to their HQ to discuss Classic? Shouldn't they have banned them instead? I don't think even Blizzard is as worried about private server people breaking ToS as you are.
---
Group of 3 people: 1 alt, 1 aoe main, 1 random outside doing whatever.
---
alt has dynamite that doesnt require engi
---
Main rounds up all the mobs in a dungeon without doing damage, drops group, alt throws dynamite, main kills, alt gets all the xp. reinvite main to group b4 he gets kicked from dungeon. rinse and repeat.
---
 Stop complaining! It's a 14y old game and everyone have a nostalgic memory of what color snow are suppose to have. Blizzard have the reference client to check what color it's supposed to have. Let's wait for their response before making silly accusations, ok? Do people actually read things? It's obviously sarcasm. You can't rely on your memory for these things.
---
Tanks without a taunt are the one meme spec that is actually completely stupid in a raid, even in a casual guild.
---
This mechanic sucks ass in BfA too, kiting has become impossible
---
I really hope they remove it in Classic, I miss kiting
---
I'm aware. I'm talking about the fact that people who DO NOT  have the beta do have the option in the launcher
---
Lucky bitch
---
And yet another "this is how it was for me, so it must be the norm" post.
---
&gt; In actual reality, everyone hated it. I know, because I played back then.  
---
Funny, so did I, and I loved it. I'm pretty sure it was real life actual reality too and not a dream. Take your bullshit somewhere else.
---
Everyone down votes these but it seems like no one seems to realize there’s going to be a mass exodus in 1-2 years when there’s no more content to do. 
---
The problem with expansions was always the power creep, leveling, bloating. You can add content without doing those things. 
---
New dungeons added would be nice down the road, even just to fix some of the itemization issues THAT DO exist with vanilla, not anything higher level.
---
Right?  Making gold as a resto shammy kind of sucked ass.  I made most of my money with alchemy and herbalism.
---
I got it to work in by switching to new reddit
---
this is an amazing post man, bog support for everyone of these ideas (especially the Uldum one, even as I was trying to redesign the cata zone into a vanilla one I knew it would never feel like vanilla, a raid is a way better choice)
---
also crazy coincidence, but I just mocked up a version of scarlet foothills that works basically exactly the same way except I added a bit to the south, great minds think alike I guess haha:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/yNi0WXJ](https://imgur.com/gallery/yNi0WXJ)
---
I'm not bashing Batman, in fact he's the only DC hero I actually like and I don't care for Ironman at all. I'm saying they both have basically the same "superpower" which is being super rich, and Stark would be better in a fight because he actually invents his own stuff, making him more adaptable to fighting other super heroes and he doesn't have some moral thing against using guns. Which is what this discussion is about.
---
Yup. All of those are true. You can also dismount when using abilities through addons or macros.
---
But then does that mean I should play mage and just AOE farm? 
---
Or should I go with who I can level the fastest to 60 like a Druid or shaman who get travel form earlier on? 
---
The dilemma for the next two months smh
---
Cyclone in vanilla huh
---
Probably people who got invited to the stress test.
---
Maybe as a help: Mine was gone after stresstest 2, which I was invited to (1 and 2) and has now reappeared and is greyed out, as you say.
---
Maybe its prep for the next stress test, if there is one, with the same batch of invites?
---
Gnomes don't weigh anything so its natural that they would float.
---
I remember that glitch. But I also don’t remember if it was vanilla or one of the other expansions.
---
That's the way it works on private servers.   
---
I VAGUELY recall my guild leader talking about one of these items, and saying it doesn't stack with Faerie fire back in Vanilla.   But I can't say for sure which item he was talking about.   Maybe that was just an assumption on his part, because the axe is expensive to make?   idk
---
Whoever decorated that cake is really damn good!
---
And those People were invited to the Stress test.
---
You only get that option in case you already have it installed - Blizzard did this for the purpose of allowing players to uninstall the game rather than play the game.
---
To be fair, complaining about something potentially huge and being wrong is way different than complaining just to complain.
---
This a million times. Its also really boring to watch AV in general, but for 72 hours? The viewership of streams has gone down too. Its just boring.
---
By far the most efficient way to level an alt if you're happy with paying two subs is to dual box them both to 60 the first time.
---
Millenials cant understand this. Them be like "sir that games are for no-lifers"
---
Then dive their heads on phones for hours
---
No, everybody downvotes this because we have a milion of these threads and it makes so much more sense to see what happens and what the community wants in a year, as blizzard have said.
---
For real! That robin gave me a good chuckle.
---
Did anyone remember being able to actually kite npcs too? I did it in tbc. If you ran side to side in a way you could literally never get hit even by npcs. I did it in TBC and there was a video showing a human doing it on the harvesters in westfall.
---
nahh i just put it down to us not being boring.
---
I don't watch any streamers, I find it boring for the most part to watch other people play games.
---
&gt;kind of magic.
---
 There can be only one
---
They have their problems but a lot of  specs were in their best state in TBC in my opinion.
---
this rage that lasts a thousand years
---
People like you are my favorite. Oh, you don't irrationally hate streamers to an unhealthy degree? You must be obsessed with them. Streamers aren't that big of a deal. Stop acting like a child.
---
The shitshow starts with being forced to change names. Solve that first, then maybe.
---
Stargate Id say
---
The problem is people are complaining without actually having any evidence/proof to back it up, acting like they do, which has just as big effect as not complaining about things we **should** be complaining about.
---
Blue velvet\*
---
&gt; TBC or WotLK, which were, by FAR and objectively, the best expansions. 
---
Ehh no, because "best" is a subjective term. There is no such thing as "objectively best" because it depends on your criteria for "best". Example: If your only criteria of what makes a game good is the number of players then i would recommend pokemon go or candy crush.
---
Well the stings are akin to ranged rogue poison.  The hunter does have magic and some fools even try spell power hunter...  So not knowing which hinter attack is magical or not is understandable.
---
Hunter's Mark is dispellable I believe.
---
Models are okay. Its animations that are weird and unnatural.
---
Well. Of course these games are going to take longer. People don’t care a out rep and honor. On classic, people might easily want to lose quickly rather than try to win slowly.
---
Wan a harder game, stick to retail?
---
OK, hold my beer
---
Hunters needed more actionbars to actually have enough space for all their skills. And I'd say over half of them were useful and if you were skilled enough you knew how to utilise it all.
---
In retail.. You have 4 useful spells.
---
Thanks for holding my beer.
---
Sometimes on the internet people use exaggeration to prove a point
---
If we end up with layering I hope that you are correct about all of this. 
---
Here's my concept of Clusters:  [https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c06uj5/the\_solution\_to\_the\_tourist\_problem/](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c06uj5/the_solution_to_the_tourist_problem/)
---
Barrens is savannah, Tanaris is a real desert
---
Tbh I don't really care what you do, I was mostly joking. And I agree that spamming people with a macro isn't the right way to ask.
---
I do think, however, that you'll miss out on some of the interactions that made Vanilla great. I've made friends with someone who whispered me asking for a group because I said, "I can't do it now, but ask me again next time and if I'm available I'll go." That person added me to their friends list and whispered me again a different day. I was able to go, so I joined him and we ended up getting along well and playing together a lot.
---
But ultimately if that's not your thing, do whatever makes you happy.
---
It was added as a way to uninstall the game. They don't actually have access to this round of stress tests.
---
You round everything up on your main without doing any damage so the mobs are not tapped but do something to generate a bit of threat so they don’t kill the alt. Then you disband the group and have the lower level character throw dynamite or do a small aoe to tag everything and then kill it all with the 60. You have 60 seconds to kill everything and reform the group before getting ported out. The lowbie gets full exp for all the mobs and it is very fast.
---
Show me on this gnome where the gnome touched you.
---
But man that thing can be set ablaze
---
This is a visual thing for those who installed the client from the stress test.
---
&gt;wanting classic to be classic = ruining classic
---
:thonking:
---
This new area seems like a perfect fit, maybe we could even remove the mountains inbetween and make it more accessible from tyr's hand so it feels more like one big zone.
---
But the scarlet crusade patch could also include hearthglen and the north loarderon area.
---
For Uldum I didn't work on it at all I have no idea and it is pretty hard, problem is I want all new content to be and **look**  much different from the retails versions, I can't think of a way Uldum would look different from the cataclysm version and in cataclysm it really released like nobody has ever went there before.
---
So maybe it should just be scrapped
---
Show me on the doll where the bad hunter touched you.
---
&gt; In vanilla, unless you are in the best 1-2 raiding guilds on the server, no one was a try hard douche. In today's retail, seemingly everyone you run into is a try hard douche.
---
So if you want people to perform well and pull their weight, you are a "tryhard douche".
---
that doesn't seem biased at all
---
Another filter is **n-"name"**, useful if you only want to search a player's name at not guilds with the same name.
---
1. holy weaver and/or support t1 paladin
---
2. I mean... skill will be a much bigger determining factor. I don't believe any healing classes have to many points in their respective healing trees for pvp. the most capable healer of doing damage and healing is ele shaman.
---
3. Druids in cat form.
---
This would have been a thousand times funnier if he then proceeded to kill you while the music kept on rolling.
---
Allahu ahi are
---
No get that. I personally didn't care for AV back in Vanilla. Never cared to grind out a BG like that (I also hated WSG with no timers, AB was my jam), and as I have stated below me, and above me somewhere else, I'd support an older version of AV, simply because I got nothing to lose in an area that I dont care to play that much in. Look at those same threads and you'll see a voice arguing against pve/pvp BGs, some people just want to play a game and have it end to feel accomplished, like me, were no less of a player compared to you, we're just different players. 
---
What really gets me though, is the ironic "This Vanilla patch isn't TRUE vanilla!". Along with that, the #NoChanges seems to falter when we are seeing dungeons are easier than we last thought (private servers buffed their difficulty as one of the main factors). Classic is really showing the petty side of a new growing community. 
---
Back in the day, there were different players, and different players did different things. PvP players didn't like to PvE, and PvE players didn't like to PvP, but we both had to in order to get this piece of gear or that one tp help you accomplish whatever ends of your goals were. 
---
I see 1.12 AV as fine, you don't. I'm not alone, and nor are you. I'm fine with voice my support of endless AV's since I doubt I'll be partaking much in that content.
---
As a hunter you can out of party quest/ grind your druid super easily if you have two accounts. I did it for a friend on his character and you can level incredibly fast this way. There are a lot of world elites out there that you can grind to make the leveling easier. One of the best ones are the elites outside of SM. You can start grinding them around level 22 all the way through 32 and get levels really quickly. Just have the druid tag it first and have the hunter then shoot them. Super efficient and effective way to level.
---
Mages, hunters on top, warlocks close behind them.
---
Stuff like warrior or rogue can also be fun and efficient once you get insane gear. You run from mob to mob and loot.
---
Druids didn’t have cyclone until BC. I don’t even recall them having any CC other than in bear or cat form aside from roots.
---
"way to be a dick"

"ASSHOLE! ASSHOLE NOCHANGES ASSHOLE!"

Stretches and yoga. Take breaks every few hours, obviously. Break up that time and don't sit at your desk for hours on end else you'll just fuck your back up more. Those medicine chair balls are awesome, too.
---
Not in the guilds I was in. In those being WC was a bit like getting benched.
---
This, alongside with the increased deadzone makes me kinda sad. I'm deciding between warlock and hunter and if this isn't going away I'll probably roll lock.
---
Not all matches last this short (or very long for that matter). This was me today:
---
[https://puu.sh/DGels/c0caf06825.jpg](https://puu.sh/DGels/c0caf06825.jpg)

lasted bit over 10 hours in the end.
---
No one says that.
---
Unless you have a health problem sounds like you just have weak back muscles. Get stronger neck/back/shoulders and sitting up all day won't be painful.
---
There's a horde teleport to Gnomer in Booty Bay dude.
---
And you want like five a week at most as a tank (usually it's fine to just use your Warden Staff). Even if you're going HAM, it's \~40 minutes of farming spread over 2 hours—not a big deal.
---
1. They are trying to recreate Vanilla as close as they can.
---
2. They want you to tell them what's wrong, because it's Beta, and that's what it's for.
---
at least a hundred or so in this particular neighborhood I would imagine? The neighborhood looks like this   ~~00~~ with the line in the middle being a fairly busy road with a car going through any particular intersection it at least every 7-10 seconds. So traffic is high to say the least for a neighborhood. (that main road cuts through 4 different HoA's and we are the first one. 
---
That being said, a decent penny is spent replacing trees from drunk drivers/swerving to avoid kids and hitting the trees. (major highschool on that road)
---
Plus the Library is privately owned by our HoA so thats where a huge chunk goes paying the employees. Granted we get some benefits on property taxes from the town since they dont have to take care of the library.
---
Wait, shouldn't the tame fail because you lost the mob's aggro?
---
In terms of powerful characters that are broken AF? DC there's no question on that. Storytelling that's actually worth a damn? Marvel no contest.
---
Teleport isn't until level 30.
---
you can shot a sting, arcane shot, concussive shot, scatter shot, just not auto or aimed.
---
Yeah that’s what I’m
---
Wondering but will it actually be looked at by legit buyers
---
Sunder is overridden by imp Expose armor.
---
Nobody likes boomkins. Eat that thing away!
---
I agree with the faces, so many of them look awful. I enjoy the new animations so much more though. Warcraft has always been cartoony and I feel that the new ones have more OOMF. But I can understand if the faces are too much for you.
---
I love desolate, barren areas. People either give me funny looks or just think I am straight up trolling when I say that Silithus and Desolace are my favourite zones from vanilla, since absolutely no one else liked them.

The main thing that made AV hard was that there were very few tanks able to tank the elite NPCs and so even a little disruption or losing a graveyard meant the game went on for a lot longer.  Even having 1 tank, in tanking gear and spec made a huge difference in how long it took.  Tanking and healing were not nearly as prolific in early battlegrounds as they are now.
---
Catform is such shit at lvl 20 though. Running faster is probably the best bit. You don't get ferocious bite till 32 and you don't get pounce till 36. It's really at lvl 40+ with fearie fire and lotp cat form starts feeling nice.
---
That is how I remember it working in vanilla.   If they stack on the pirated servers, then they're WAY wrong.
---
I should share all of my old alpha maps and infos with you so you can have more ideas.
---
Uldum was officialy planned to be a raid and the zone was much smaller than the cataclysm version, I have the source based on official ceoncept maps
---
I just got a fresh idea for uldum : Maybe the classic version would be a mirage and that explains why we can't see the full area. Or the opposite, the cataclysm version is a mirage and was hidden. This fits the desert and uldum theme pretty well.
---
You're getting your gnomes from the wrong gnome depot
---
I don't know, maybe they like urine-colored AV?
---
Actually vanilla did cater to the casual player.  The game though  hard was considered much more casual friendly compared to the other mmos at the time.   However they made choices that left parts of the game only achievable by the most dedicated.  HW/GM, Naxx, Scarab Lord,  Rhokdelar before it was cheesed.  Certain crazy rep grinds.
---
All those things were awesome even if you didn't do it.  I helped make the scarab lord, I helped multiple HW reach rank 14, i followed server first Naxx.  It was all awesome even though i wasn't those 3 things.  Oh and I fucked over Ally wintersaber grinders.  Haha.
---
What's the shittiest place ingame? I'm pretty sure it's inspired by Düsseldorf.
---
I want MMO PvP again. Wildstar is dead so I don't have that top tier PvP anymore, so Classic will scratch that itch for me. People played Wildstar PvP for years without any upgrades on gear or seasons in a dying game, so I don't see why the same sort of people won't be entertained by WoW's PvP?  
---
PvP is always new to me even if it's the same old BG, as the players are a random variable. As long as it's not chain pre-mades stomping pugs endlessly, PvP will be fun.  
---
Also, World PvP. I'm so fucking hyped to have that again.
---
Pretty sure theres a herb or 2 in SM cath but i don’t know if it’s worth
---
&gt;I was going to say India, given the references to The Jungle Book
---
By that metric you also collect the pages to a very clear reference to The Green Hills of Africa, and you also do quests involving a very clear reference to The Heart of Darkness, so pretty damn heavy Africa references...
---
Teleport is lvl 20, though you don't get teleport: UC or teleport: Darn until 30.
---
My 9 hour AV says otherwise
---
If you get your way, I hope you can enjoy a dead game a few months after naxx releases.
---
Dude, clearing ZG in purples was hard (at first).
---
One thing people always seem to forget. You needed enchanting rods to level. And if you don't have a friend who is leveling Blacksmithing people will absolutely abuse the fact you need these rods. They did on my server and they literally cost more than you can afford while leveling. You will get stuck at some point. And inevitable have to go back.
---
For secondary professions, Tailoring supplements enchanting the best, since most of the craftables in tailoring won't sell for much on the auction house. Simply selling ores/herbs and buying greens/blues to DE will not be profitable enough. 
---
So unless you have a group to run dungeons with and feed you all their items, there is no way you can solo level enchanting along the way.
---
I have added questing regions to arathi, tristfal glades and stonetalon mountains and a stormwind fields area behind the city but never bothered to post them cus they were so small too
---
You can farm earth eles in silithus
---
It’s not faster at all. But you can gear up the alt well to make questing easier. 
---
I did it back in vanilla, as my brother quit playing, after a wee while. But he had months left on subs.
---
So I levelled a shammy and used my hunter to run him through low level instances to gear up in good blues. But still had to go solo questing as this was quicker.
---
The mage class has so many fun spells, I am seriously considering starting with a mage
---
Druids are very viable tanks, and can MT a lot of content. The lack of cooldowns is certainly a thing, and they trade avoidance for mitigation and effective health, but they do significantly higher threat without sacrificing anything.
---
Dude, do you think before you talk?
---
Scenario 1 
---
Melee range is greater, assuming ranged is the same the deadzone is smaller.
---
Scenario 2
---
Melee range is greater, assuming ranged is greater by the same margin the deadzone is the same, just further away, but the total ranged range is also greater, which would be freaking BIS
---
Scenario 3 
---
Melee range is greater, ranged is greater but total range is the same. This is the scenario you are on, its possible, but none of these are comfirmed AFAIK so it's all assumptions.
---
I take this over all the pictures and memes that do not lead to any discussion. Remember, just because you and me saw a post like this does not mean everyone has.
---
I also seen a streamer today say he couldn't feign trap.
---
I agree there is things deeply wrong with that comment I made. But this is the real world buddy. True the law says they can't do that, but every employer in every city/town/state/country does this. They don't directly say it, but it happens.  Even if they don't fire you for that direct reason, it's a mental strike against you. That's just how it works. 
---
We all want to wear rose colored glasses but the truth is behind those glasses we are all demon eye'd assholes. Welcome to being human.
---
People did World PvP before the Honor system ever came out in Vanilla. It was a BLAST. People do it simply because it's fun. It's fun to be a little shit and harass other players. It's fun to get jumped but take down your attackers. It's fun to even hunt them down later for revenge if they mopped the floor with you.  
---
LoL and DoTA are MOBAs, not even the same game type. Like- I can get in quick PvP matches in Splatoon that are enjoyable, but it's not the same as playing a Hunter in WoW.
---
You're out of your mind if you think a bunch of boomers have enough time to fuck around with garbage specs raiding when we have at most a few hours a week to progress.
---
Did you read OP’s first sentence?
---
You're probably right that it will get cleared quickly, but that's by the top (whatever percentage of) players.
---
It's not unknown territory, anymore...  at least not for the most part.
---
But I think you're missing the fact that there will be a ton of people who have never seen the content before at level, and, if we're talking about the current crop of retail casuals, don't even have a firm grasp on the concept of CC.
---
The pserver fans...  sure...  they'll have an easier go of it.  Top retail guilds will probably clear it quickly...
---
The vast majority of people are going to struggle.
---
People like me who cleared all of it when it was live might not even care how long it takes to get to endgame.  But I sure am not going to stroll into a raid unprepared and expect the other 39 people to carry me.
---
Nowadays I'd say that's either Razorgore or Skeram. Funnily enough I've always thought Razorgore was the toughest encounter in BWL, until you overgear it. 
---
It's also amazing that even after so many years people still pull aggro on Vael. Warriors be like oh shit I have infinite rage? Let's just spam everything and turn the boss into the raid and wipe us... 
---
Vael sucks for another reason though; he will remove the world buffs from someone and usually that's only 4-5 people which means if you're on of those who lost their buffs your performance will stink compared to everyone else. 
---
I've heard that world buffs will have a cooldown on Classic so hopefully not everyone will have them all the time.
---
Most guilds didn't have 40 rich people with a $2,000 PC, flat screen monitor, and broadband Internet.  I had two out of three but lord knows the rest of my guild didn't.
---
Private servers running for the past 10 years say "hi"
---
During the AQ pre-event it’s huge to ensure both factions get the resource crap done (if I’m remembering that it’s separate and now a collective effort)
---
Its actually Darnassus and Thunder Bluff at level 30. You get Orgrimmar, Under City, Ironforge, and Stormwind.
---
I don’t have a dad and I’d say WoW literally raised me. I played from pre-teens and i’m 23 now. 
---
I still don’t understand the desire to play Beta. WoW is a heavy investment of a game, and working hard on a character to have it deleted.. seems pointless.
---
p.s. - they don't.
---
I wouldn't because Classic wow never had tv ads, and there isnt a new 50 dollar product to buy like expansions.
---
Can’t decide between this Troll Smile and the Angry Scowl.
---
For them to be meaningful they should come with a purpose and an adequate content patch.
---
For the stonetalon mountain cut area, it was planned to be a dungeon called Stonetalon peak, I also have sources for that.
---
I think if you type:
---
/console glow ffx 0
---
that should turn this off.
---
Great video.
---
It’s cute you think that fans running private servers and a company running classic have the same goals in mind.
---
And the discount macro line got easier. There is /cancelaura and honestly, probably a /dismount.
---
This is beta. No one cares about honor gains and rep. The two main reasons for rushing General. Things will be different on live.
---
Pantychrist
---
Strawman. Stop changing the subject.
---
You claimed the game is going to die if there's no new content. Private servers over the past 10 years have already proven you wrong.
---
1000 needles is based off of City Park in San Francisco.
---
*You have been banned from* r/classicwow
---
It’s about the process of leveling and the community. Look at diablo (all versions). Somehow people are still racing to max level on seasonal characters in that game even though they’re probably just going to delete it to make room for next seasons character. It’s fun even if it gets deleted.
---
The reality is WoW is very old and trivialized to death over the years with all the info out there. To play the game as an optimal spec further simplifies it. 
---
Also, the term viable and optimal is thrown around for dps when it shouldn't be. You doing less dps will not be the determining factor whether or not you kill a boss. This term is only applied for top TOP guilds who are progressing.
---
Not a fan of this yellow lighting either.
---
Are we seriously still having this discussion?
---
&gt; the most fun part of the game for me is improving my character and i  rather do less fun things to achieve that goal than doing more fun  things and at the end of the day thinking wtf am i doing with my life, 
---
That's a *you* problem. Not everyone is going to be min/maxing their playtime at all times as if it's a second job. Not everyone has this depressing mentality that if they're not doing something 'useful' in a game, the time is wasted. That's down right silly. It's a game. Do the things that are fun.
---
I was going to enemy zones and harassing lowbies on my Shaman in Ghost Wolf form or going to Duskwood at lvl 20 on my Orc hunter to snipe the questing Alliance and stir the pot until lvl 60s showed up. The challenge of escaping them alive was delightful. I somehow managed to rank up on my Shaman *and* still enjoy WPvP.
---
TBH middle school / high school was pretty depressing
---
Jesus Christ it's not out until the 27th of August.
---
Arenas are shit for PvP. Group battles are where it's at.
---
the only? frost bolt, frost armor and evocation are amazing for survivability and downtime reduction.
---
I think it has more to do with the fact that their reference is 1.12, which means no copy of original AV.
---
You realize people enjoy doing that right?
---
Huh. Maybe it's just me. I've tested it before taking a flight path from one end of the world to the other and requested a stop immediately after passing the next location on the chain and have had to stay on the flight path the entire way.
---
Its annoying but I just deal with the extra paths I have to take of I mess up
---
That there is the face that killed wow.
---
Back in my day I had to walk to school 10 miles uphill, both ways, in snow without shoes!
---
The troll females can not blink. Please tell me how that's actually better.
---
Better than travel form? dont think so :D
---
Still better than ‘this is how it was for me on a private server post’. Were you expecting a statistical analysis of the success rates of guilds during vael back in vanilla?
---
It'll be harder to zerg AV on BfA then it will be to zerg AV on Classic once people have some gear. The NPCs all scale on BfA, quite well too.
---
Yet im still getting suprised by bad players in pservers after 15 years of vanilla. You are really being optimistic about people playing video games, most majority of them is just bad at their games. 
---
Also with first week clears, in pservers its almost same 200-300 people keep clearing naxx every server. Its very low % compared to server population.Last server maybe 15 guild cleared naxx, maybe 10 of em did naxx multiple times beforehand. There are still guilds progressing after 2 months and more after release, not seeing sapphiron.
---
Yea don't be so optimistic about your average wow guild.
---
Damn bro you can do better than that
---
It might, but it won't run well if it does. The atom is a really weak cpu, and you have no dedicated GPU
---
Yes. Fairly recently, I think.
---
Models are awesome and distinct. Animations are appropriately blocky and jagged.
---
I really loathe the rubbery and overly dynamic animations of retail. Not a fan of the new models either. Essentially every race lost a huge chunk of charm and quirk.
---
No, I totally am for the Kara Crypts, I said that would be cool. Or, perhaps the Karazhan that was made in the Alpha, that’s never been used either. Those are both cool ideas.
---
As far as the revamped zones, I’m still not into that. The aesthetic might be different, and it might be littered with different mobs and quests, but the terrain is the same. I’m exploring a revamped version of a zone I already have explored. They could have a field day with Twilight Highlands for example, or Wildhammer Highlands rather, and make it *look* different. But I’m still not keen on exploring a reskin. I’d much rather have fresh content, either in already existing areas, like with Azshara, or filling in some other unused areas that didn’t even get used in Cata. For example, the guy who’s been making the terrain maps had one for the savage coast, south of blasted lands. Something like that is entirely more cool to me. I’d actually be exploring an entire new zone, not just a reskin.
---
Someone on the MMO-champ forums actually showed it's negative resistance that makes Ragnaros take so much damage.  Apparently it was removed in patch 1.09 but re-added specifically for Ragnaros, then removed again in the first stat squish.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/LxFqdk1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/LxFqdk1.jpg)
---
For pvp? :D
---
No worries unless you're doing ubrs!
---
I don't fear.
---
When I played vanilla, there weren't even connecting flights.
---
2.57g at lvl 20? You rich, mon!
---
Prowl is nice too though. 
---
Being able to stealth without having to be a rogue is awesome.
---
You get a certain amount of rested xp each day.  I am not sure what it is.  There's a cap on rested XP.   I'am not sure what that is either, lol.  I think 1/2 level per day in inn, and 2 levels rested max.
---
The issue is whether blizzard can tell one from another. I don't trust their judgement in that seeing as listening to the wrong people is what got us retail.
---
If people want to see what melee leeway looks like on the beta currently, here's a link to a youtube vid where it's visually explained [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H_BrXp3jTM)
---
My impression is people are unhappy because of the implementation of spell batching. As I understand it, each tick/batch is a longer window than it used to be. I could be wrong but that's what I've gathered from posts here and there
---
really rubbing the beta in our faces hunh...lol jk sounds like everything i’m looking forward to. honestly my biggest fear is not being able to play with my friends that are coming back for it. when vanilla was out i was like 15 and had no responsibilities. we all have families and full time jobs now, it’s a different time
---
I'm fully aware that bad players enjoyed hopping in once a month to pretend they were pvping. Nothing wrong with that, I'm sure you had a lot of fun and felt like a big boy
---
fuck
---
People are not trying to win, they want to play the lvl 58 characters :D
---
There will be a mod that will say how many successful dispels a person did, and that means people will get shamed in raid chat after a wipe.
---
didnt damagemeters do this in classic? I neither raid leaded or played anything bit warrior rogue
---
I have similar mindset. Of course when a higher level ganks me I rage. But then I see easy-kill target. And I'm like - should I kill him? Seems pointless. Just an asshole thing to do. This guy has nothing to do with the guy that ganked me. So MOSTLY I just leave them be.
---
Fair fight on the other hand? Doesn't seem too appealing as well. Fair fight means you might lose. Lose buffs and waste time. What's more, its not wise to piss off a guy that can kill you if you intend to quest in area. 
---
There are bright sides though! Some race/class combos are 95% composed of assholes. IF they don't attack you its just because they know they are too weak. Night elf hunters, undead rogues, female undead priests, gnome warriors... fuck these guys. Just kill them on sight. Trust me, in your position they would show no mercy.
---
Larger scale battles are nice too. Sometimes specific area just becomes a warzone. Everybody attacks everybody. Skeletals on the ground. If sb stays in such area he knows the risk. Attacking them feels nice. 
---
Finally, many gankers actually prefer to stay within 7 levels of their targets so they get honor and their victims at least "struggle" before they die. This means you will eventually be much higher level than them! Enacting justice on behalf of poor low levels is the best thing of all. 
---
So yes, PvP servers have their perks. Playing warrior on such server is another thing whatsoever. You are free kill for most other classes. People who roll warrior on PvP servers generally only care about max lvl PvP.

This is more common in DKP systems (hoarding). The great thing about EPGP is using decay with it. Therefore, the more you hoard it the more it decays. Smart players will pick up upgrades regardless, because if they don't they will lose their EPGP to decay. I was in a guild for 6 years and we used this method. Sure, we had some players who would try to hoard it for BIS items, but a player who doesn't ends up getting more upgrades overall.

Uh, no.

Warrior and Hunter have the highest uptime due to spammable instant attacks.
---
Gnomes are helium confirmed
---
It’s not so black and white. Spell batching could easily be too long in the beta. They’re artificially bringing the mechanic in as opposed to from Vanilla. Just like OP, people aren’t saying “get rid of it,” people are saying it needs refining to be more accurate to Vanilla.

Trust me, I love the warcraft novels and in multiple novels (day of the dragon, war of the ancients, night of the dragon i am sure of) he is referred to as Deathwing.

Imagine not playing the peggle addon

Isn't blizzard rank 1 a good aoe grinding skill for mages? I thought that at level 20 was when you stopped questing and just started farming mob groups.
---
&gt;  time to level up a Char from 1-60 on Retail

Setting the bar real high for yourself huh? At least make it a challenge.

Or Turtle which makes game unwinnable for both sides
---
I have 13 buttons on mouse, plus all the modifiers for those.  Plus every button from tilde to 6 and down, plus modifiers.  I have maxed out the buttons I use.  The game literally cannot hold more.  Or are you suggesting there is some way for classic to display more bars than retail?

This lil guy will haunt my dreams - that’s what she said

awesome
---
I think it would look completely different, you wouldn't recognize it at all.
---
The twilight highland in cataclysm is heavily corrupted and has big maws and twilight stuff everywhere,  like half of map is completely destroyed in cataclysm. 
---
For exemple the obsidian forest is burnt in cataclysm, in classic it would be a giant and dense forest with wildlife.
---
My version would have many more dwarven and Dragonmaw villages, camps and creatures, it would probably have more foilage and trees
---
Even the terrain changed just look at this :  "In the [Cataclysm](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Cataclysm_(event)) brought about by [Deathwing](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Deathwing), Northeron's famed icy cliffs rapidly melted due to the catastrophic climate shift, and most of the independent dwarves who lived there were killed in the subsequent buildup of [Twilight's Hammer](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight%27s_Hammer) forces and the emergence of [Iso'rath](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Iso%27rath). Some of the wreckage is still visible along the northern coast.[\[39, 9\]](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight_Highlands) Even though most of Northeron was destroyed, the nearby spiritual center of [Kirthaven](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kirthaven) remained intact.[\[2\]](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Northeron#cite_note-CDev-2) "
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Northeron](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Northeron)
---
No, I'm just saying that using your example of your terrible PC and assuming it was anywhere near the norm is nonsensical
---
The best ads for classic wow are streamers. The audience is there. Those are not people who watch that much tv anymore. So if you complain about streamers in beta not reporting any bugs: they are ads.
---
that should defo be what goes there 
---
speaking of dungeons, some people were wondering what kind of dungeon I meant when I put those blue spirals in, here's what I was thinking for each of them: https://imgur.com/a/A9pjzLr
---
that's what I used to do back then, hope they make it so it works like it used to.\^\^
---
Mm...nah. :P
---
Reminds me of the Super Mario 64 intro with Mario’s face
---
4K bonus honor in 6 hrs. That any good?
---
Most people had broadband and it didn't take anything near a $2000 PC to play with way better performance than what that guy was describing
---
bear form for questing is arguably more efficient even after 20.
---
Rolling Hunter as my first class back in Vanilla this made me feel so amazing. That was some great cross-faction team work.
---
Hmm, I am actually quite sure that the clip in this vurtne video doesn't demonstrate leeway but bad latency from either player.
---
I was playing warrior in classic and sometimes had to run inside of enemies in order to hit them (when chasing them). It really depended on your/their ping back then and differed a lot from fight to fight.
---
I think a second release of a game is doomed to have a significant subset of players prioritise efficiency. Exactly what happened to Oldschool Runescape, and is very likely to plague WoW Classic too.
---
Relog. In classic it would drop you off at the next point. I’m sure that’ll still be in classic when it’s released
---
Bite the bullet and go buy a cheap gaming PC. I run Classic at 144 fps on a cheap $500 computer from Best Buy. It's not going to perform well on that machine.
---
Ours were both made in 2005.
---
Same forever, man, change is bad.
---
Streamers also offer some of the best video evidence for bugs. The bug list that’s pinned on this subreddit, for instance, contains video links as supporting evidence, all of which point to streaming sites.
---
My biggest fear is Blizzard listens to the nochanges crowd.
---
I think they did but for sure in Classic the updated Recount or Details! will show that information so you’re right about the shaming. But I’m not too keen on the wasted time to get to that point where people realize it’s not a dps race with these bosses but doing the one mechanic.
---
May I suggest reading [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0i5nv/the_melee_range_increases_when_moving_does_this/er5xzb7/?context=15) rather than coughing up the same stuff we already addressed yesterday. Thank you for your time.

Ah can’t wait to break the fucking bank learning new spells every level
---
it's funny how bad the world lighting is after they showcased how much they focused on perfecting the light of a random lamp with the demo
---
if you think constantly blabbering nonsense is not being boring you are wrong, that's just my opinion
---
&gt; You don't NEED to be in there for the victory screen pop up to get value from a BG like you do on retail.
---
I vaguely remember at least 1 quest from vanilla requiring a victory in AV.
---
I thought I did.. but I  dont..
---
Join a guild rather than pugging raids.
---
The Elitist Jerks melee dps spreadsheets are done under the assumptions that sunder armor, faerie fire, and annihilator stack.
---
Consider a new guild man.
---
They could have both equipped. Typically they would use the wand for mana-free damage. You could technically weave them if you are in melee range.
---
Ghost wolf ftw
---
I remember a video of a spell power hunter who would get like 3k arcane shot hits lol
---
I contemplated whether its even worth posting this reply but whatever. The worst thing that can happen is I lose some internet points. If you are opposed to discussion then you dont have to read this. I have not attacked you personally.
---
&gt; You don't need to agree with or understand the argument.Just understand that people like different things.
---
I accept that people like different things. You dont have to like the things I like and that's fine with me as long as you dont affect me. I think that's fair. My reason for wanting to understand why people keep echoing this statement or even why you think my mind cant be changed because Blizzard is hearing this voice against any changes and I think it ***negatively effects my experience***.
---
&gt; If it needs to be explained to you, then there's no changing your mind.
---
If someone who doesnt follow any sports asks another person why they follow a certain sport you dont just answer with "your mind cant be changed if it has to be explained". I do want to understand. Its why I asked.
---
Im just asking for a solid counterpoint to my points but based on the general feeling I get from #nochangers, it seems like what it boils down to is that people dont want features that will *benefit* the majority for no reason other than some vague notion that "theres no clear line" and we'll somehow end up with LFR again.
---
I’ll be in a guild for sure but that doesn’t guarantee everyone is going to be on the same page or follow through with what will be expected.
---
Both. Wands have their own separate slot in classic.
---
It will be available in phase 1.  Other than the dungeon revamps which is later on - the raids all have their 1.12 loot tables. aka major domo will actually drop loot etc.
---
Imagine being this dumb. If blizzard listens to the no changes crowd you’ll get vanilla wow. 
---
If blizzard listens to the changes crowd, you get world of Warcraft classic remastered with sprinkles addition.
---
Both. 1h+oh and a wand or 2h and a wand
---
The movement for Classic 100% comes from private servers. From the early shitty servers that were broken as fuck to Nost which introduced a massive amount of players to vanilla. If those private servers hadn't existed there would be no movement at all for Classic because people would've long forgotten how great vanilla was.
---
From my experience as long as the guild has a rule everyone is in voice comms for raids these things get ironed out quickly. Or maybe my guild was better than most.
---
Both. Staffs are a stat stick you won't use it much. Wands are your primary non-spell damage choice.
---
Undercity is based off detroit :))))))
---
Then I must've been doing something terribly wrong in bear on the druid I'm leveling on beta, because cat form was such an outrageous dps increase it's not even funny.
---
Mobs died so much faster I took substantially less damage in catform than I did in bear form.
---
&gt;That's a you problem. Not everyone is going to be min/maxing their playtime at all times as if it's a second job. Not everyone has this depressing mentality that if they're not doing something 'useful' in a game, the time is wasted. That's down right silly. It's a game. Do the things that are fun.
---
Like i said, its fun for me. I agree with you, im not saying that the game should change because of me. But i think a lot of people think like me, and it has nothing to do with it being like a second job. Many casuals think the same. I would bet all money in the world that if they changed how the rewards worked and all of a sudden world pvp was the most efficient way to earn honor, that wpvp would be extremely popular again. for casual and harcore alike.
---
Like i said, im not complaining. I have absolutely no problem with it whatsoever. I was just saying that the system itself affects the popularity of it, and that is a fact.
---
Yeah. The other abilities are shots from the bow. Wtf.    
---
I uploaded tons of videos of me kiting with arcane shot to warcraftmovies in vanilla. It's what they mean. Auto shot doesn't do much.
---
I play a meme spec because then I can use that as an excuse for being shit.
---
Was in this game as a frost mage on ally, most of us with 50 kills left after like 30 minutes bahahah. Was too much of going no where. Which seems to be the general consensus
---
To me, I see it kind of like how I see post/pre Cataclysm Azeroth. Thousand needles is way different in Cata than Vanilla. But I don’t feel like I’m in an entirely different zone when I’m playing Cata. It’s just “thousand needles but different”. Or The center of Desolace. It’s 100% different but it’s still just “different revamped Desolace”. 
---
If Blizzard refrains from using pre-existing zones and altering them to fit Classic, I’ll be happy. Pretty much every other idea on your list is pretty cool, and could potentially add to the experience without taking too much away.
---
I set my expectations very low for this because I've done it once, when it was relevant so doing it again will be easier.
---
My fear is they know they're going to hook people, so I'm just waiting until the changes start to happen and/or microtransactions/cosmetics. It's a business, some people think they're not out to make money, they are, it's normal.
---
I mean we already have a shoddy layering or sharing system that's exploitable, 2 months before its SECOND launch.
---
Night Elf of course.
---
Twilight hammer in twilight islands/grim'batol doesn't really make sense in vanilla if i'm not mistaken
---
In vanilla they are only looking for old gods locations, such as silithus and blackfathom dephts
---
They only massively  expended everywhre and to the twilight highlands in cataclysm  
---
"**his section concerns content related to** [***Cataclysm***](https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm)**.**
---
📷Twilight's Hammer slaves inside the [Stonecore](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Stonecore), adding armor to [Deathwing](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Deathwing)'s body.
---
Seduced by the promises of power and the destructive intentions[\[5\]](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight%27s_Hammer#cite_note-speech-5) of the twisted [Aspect of Death](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Deathwing), they join him in his quest to unmake the world of [Azeroth](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Azeroth). Loyal to the Old Gods, the cultists forged new plates to hold Deathwing's torn body. Their goal was to bring Armageddon to the world.[\[20\]](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight%27s_Hammer#cite_note-20)
---
They claimed the ancient dwarven fortress of [Grim Batol](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Grim_Batol) and the surrounding [Twilight Highlands](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight_Highlands), turning it into their main base of operations under leadership of their chieftain, the [ogre mage](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ogre_mage) [Cho'gall](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Cho%27gall), wreaking havoc wherever they can. They also have enlisted the help of the dangerous [twilight dragonflight](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight_dragonflight) to bolster their ranks."
---
It would be better if the twilight clan wasn't here at all in the highlands,  it would differenciate it more from the retail version
---
About druids, that is what I tell people who ask about them. It's really fun in pvp and wpve/wpvp. You always have something you can do. You always have an answer to an enemies attacks. If you are like me and like to be busy and doing a lot druids are awesome. I can be healing an ally one second and feral charging a mage the next. Then root a warrior and switch to cat form to help dps down a priest. They are so fun and all over the place. 
---
But like you said they aren't the best at any of these things and if you cant keep up with the druid playstyle you feel even more lackluster. 
---
That and not having a good resurrection ability really stinks in 5 man instances
---
You can try retail right now for free (up to level 20).  Classic will be pretty different, but you can at least get an idea of the basic gameplay and the differences between classes and roles.  You can also try out UI add-ons and see what you like.
---
Can't hurt when you're hoofing it across a zone between 20 and 40, though.
---
It was near the norm. People’s internet and pc’s were garbage compared to today.
---
So far the only two zones I see that are really bad are Alterac Valley and Durotar. The contrast is just so bright in Durotar, its headache inducing.
---
There is a console command that gives you some control over it. Something like /console ffxGlow 0
---
Makes some zone way more tolerable. However I think Alterac Valley might just have shitty lighting in general.
---
hahahaha fucking hate this. Love this meme though!
---
You don't remember Mr. T and his Night Elf Mohawk hero class?
---
Become an engineer. When the raid lead calls wipe it because of something you probably did you can FD and then Rez a healer and they'll praise you without realizing it was your fault all along.
---
Back in vanilla my dad played a nelf hunter and while running a 5 man instance with us he had what we still call the Magic Multi Shot. 
---
He broke a sheep, pulled another mob, and some how killed a rat. It was amazing
---
This just looks like you arguing your same position from yesterday with your same elitist attitude. And... did you just cite yourself as a source? That's just impressive.
---
IDK why ppl prefer AV to last days on end lol
---
Asmon tweeted months ago that he usually goes to sleep watching Trainwrecks streams. Probably hours of hearing him in his dreams and shit lol
---
Half of TV viewers died since 2005 so I can't imagine the ads got more expensive.
---
as a rogue, AV is hella boring, either stand and watch the ranged fight or try and take out someone only to get dotted 20times and feared into death.
---
The voice give it away?
---
I think that it's best that they see how Classic goes over a few months. Listen to what people want, decide if it's commercially viable.
---
If the servers are going to be inevitably merged then you'd have the naming restrictions across all the servers in the pack.
---
&gt; But what they don't seem to understand
---
And you don't understand that everyone should palythe game they want to so shut up with your bullshit
---
Night Elf obviously.
---
Also you you can just say "Hunter". Adding incompetent is just redundant :)
---
Classic answer for your ass: QQ moar bitch
---
Oh so the staff will be on your back while casting ?
---
Players will always go the path of least resistance for the best rewards, even if its an absolutely soul crushing activity. If AV's reward structure was changed to reward active play and capturing objectives instead of finishing the game then it would allow players to have fun and be rewarded for doing so.
---
I really don't
---
Downvote FOR THE HORDE
---
oh yeah a few, i'm just awful at video games so I have to focus on one pretty hard to get good at it.
---
I'm sorry isn't this a WoW classic sub? Go bitch and moan on the other sub
---
You filthy collaborator.
---
If you exclude Superman it we be an all time epic fight. Superman is too OP though :D
---
I know it’s just a wow post.. it got me curious though!
---
I think it would be different because they wouldn't feel like a modified version, but the original and let's be honest... We don't have any atatchment to the cataclysm zones, you only felt like this because you were heavily attached to the vanilla zone. 
---
I'm not only about re using exising zones of course, but I strongly believe zones such as Wildhammer Highlands would be an amazing addition to classic+.
---
Bindings for thunderfury, they are required and we had TERRIBLE RNG to get them. I think by the time TBC came out we had like 2.
---
Personally I just make the alts I want, get them to around level 6-10 or so, park them in an Inn and just play them when they have rested XP.
---
Its the most efficient way to do it if you don't mind it taking longer.
---
It's that way with a lot of classes.
---

Well, I was bored, so I looked into it more.
---
There are several differences between the Annihilator and the non-annihilator ones.  
---
Things that seem odd:  
---
Armor Shatter lists 100% SP Scaling.  
---
Armor Shatter is not considered a 'spell'  
---
Armor Shatter is a Shadow Attack  
---
There is a lot of jankyness with the DBC files, since 1.12 was not really a 'finished state', and they are converting from that to another state.  
---
There are some files that suggest blizzard is not even converting some of the 1.12 stuff and just straight up using 2.0 stuff.
---
Yeah in vanilla you got full exp for a mob that you tagged and someone else killed. At least as far as i remember because my hunter friend helped my warrior level a lot in vanilla.
---
Yes. You could hit them with the staff instead, but typically if you want to do mana free damage your wanding them down.
---
This video is really cool with the previews of all the top 5 classes after every explanation, also with the sick intro!
---
Yeah no at least on privates FF, Anni, and Sunder/EA were the only armor reducers you could have on the boss.
---
Blame the tank and roll on his tanking weapons.
---
Nightelf. Name yourself some version of legolas.
---
Most people are just being themselves on podcasts. Asmond for example breaks character and acts really chill on them. I’ve never heard his voice really go higher in dozens of hours of classicast. Not at the end of 20 hour levelling streams where he’s basically asleep. Someone faking it would eventually break in a moment of humour/excitement/laziness.
---
I don't want to play retail. It went to hell after Cataclysm. I also think that people trying Vanilla servers will improve sub numbers for Classic.
---
There is no reason to curtail talk about classic servers.
---
we just wonna put some energy into videos. Thats all, we have fun doing it and just wonna have fun with the community.
---
This all sounds super fun! Especially intrigued by the implications of the idea of a high level raid a in major city. Especially if they all have unique loot and can be run by both factions... Horde raiding SW to get to the raid / Alliance rolling in hot on Org for New RFC? Awesome.
---
Awesome , that seals the deal. Priest it is! Thanks!

No it wasn't, my 2001 PC had VASTLY better performance than you describe there, and broadband was absolutely the norm, it was 2005, not fucking 95.
---
Go play on a private server then.
---
AV was probably my favorite thing in vanilla wow. Admittedly, i main rogue.
---
&gt;Considering raiding, how do you set yourself aside from the bunch early to secure a spot?
---
Combat swords as a Human. When they see you're pouring out massive amounts of damage in guild 5 mans, they'll get you a spot.
---
Ok. That's cool, but if that's what you're after you'd never advocate for pre 1.12 AV - because that was even worse at rewarding players or encouraging fun gameplay than 1.12 AV does.
---
&gt;human men
---
&gt;human women
---
this :)
---
What kind of mindset is this??
---
I believe you , it doesn't matter at all anyway it's just a name.
---
I just think Deathwing in cataclysm is different, he becomes a metal dragon and is a lot different than his "neltharion" form pre cataclysm.
---
In vanilla I think he would look more like the original than in cataclysm
---
On a raid boss? God damn that is savage!
---
\&gt;  If you want a harder game you should stick to retail. 
---
QFT
---
It’s going to be a very popular class, and there’s good reasons for it.  Every group is happy to have a mage.
---
Dunno why you get offensive straight away. I am following the leeway discussion quite closely in general. Not just since yesterday. There were tons of posts about it even before the classic beta came out.
---
However, I am just point out that  "long range" melee hits in classic pvp videos can't be taken as a reference. Latency (on both's end) was the key driver from how far you were able to attack someone.
---
Follow catdanny on Spotify
---
Yes, up to a certain point (I wanna say 75, but I'm not 100% sure
---
Well that is the pessimist point of view. Let's hear a realistic one please.
---
Sure I do. That aired during TBC.
---
Yeah.. no I won't, I'm having a blast and will at release..
---
I haven't tought about what they would be, it's up to your imagination, the only thing i tought about is a campaign in these locations and a story related to them.
---
They could be a dungeon, a solo questchain, a raid, opposite faction or not...
---
Classic servers should remain vanilla.
---
If they want to open more expansions they can create new servers and allow people to copy their character over without destroying the original.
---
No, I never played a private server and I remember how great vanilla was.  As do millions more. 
---
Private server populations seem to have an over exaggerated sense of importance
---
Not gunna lie, I just found the twilights hammer was in classic like a month ago, and I'm still not really sure what they were doing there haha, totally agree about the grim batol stuff.
---
That's a bold move Cotton, let's see how it plays out.
---
FUCKING STREAMERS
---
It'll improve my survivability and give me time to wingclip and get back out to ranged! Hunter weapon!
---
A bit mask is a computer programming method to give several identifying properties to something in the same 'variable' to save data space, but doing so in a way that you can pull multiple useful data properties out of it:
---
For example a typical bit mask looks like:  
---
000X = Property 1  
---
00X0 = Property 2  
---
0X00 = Property 3    
---
X000 = Property 4  
---
So a bitmask of (1111) would mean all four properties are true, while a bitmask of (0000) would mean all are false.  Something like (1010) would mean 2 and 4 are true, and 1 and 3 are false.  
---
A made up bitmask might look like:
---
000X = Attack or Spell  
---
00X0 = Helpful or Harmful  
---
0X00 = Debuf or No Debuf    
---
X000 = Can it miss?
---
So then (1011) = a Harmful Spell with No debuf that can miss.  
---
These values are then typically stored as an integer.  SO (1011) = 11
---
Male Nightelf. No contest.
---
Not after he buys all those spells.
---
I didn’t even know howie mandel was famous back then
---
10 man dungeons all the way.
---
The Devs could just change it, it's an easy improvement to make AV games play out like people remember it.
---
&gt;I'm right, it doesn't matter if I ignore valid points that contradict my argument because I'M RIGHT.

The last sentence of the same post you responded to.
---
In short, there is min max, which becomes more relevant the more hardcore and competitive the players. But, like league of legends or just about any game out there where optimization and min max are a thing, for every hardcore player with no life and a lot of game knowledge, there are ten parrots who say all the usual pro-min max stuff and harbor the same, usually toxic attitude without just about any of the justification for doing so.
---
I'll give a blatant example if my point isn't clear.
---
People in guilds which are competing for world first don't need to explain why they are ruthlessly competitive. Need to work? Sry my dude we're going To have to let you go.
---
But on the other side of the same coin is the Joe shmo raid, where everyone involved in one way or another could easily be criticized for improvement. You're missing x enchants, lacking this resist item, messing up parses, the list goes on.
---
In the context of the Joe shmo raid, the guy complaining that the raid has an enhancement shaman is a fuckboi.
---
Tldr: every guild and raid has a culture, sometimes min max is *expected*, sometimes it's inappropriate.
---
I believe that the reason cats are preferred over raptors is that cats have the dash ability which allows them to get on targets faster which equals more dps at the end of the day.
---
Was "For the Alliance" in vanilla?

True that, might as well take thunderfury as well shitty tank weapon. It has agility on it so obviously it is a hunter weapon!
---
The reason I mained an undead.
---
I was always giddy hitting 20 on a mage.
---
Dammit. I miss the old AV with the race to the mid - uncapped GY (Snowfall). The battle there at that first cap point could last longer than a whole 1.12 AV match. As others have said, wins in AV were meaningful and you really had defeated the enemy team. Not just run past and been the best equipped to zerg, even if it is more honour per hour, it is significantly less fun hardly what I would call PvP.
---
If I wanted to mount up and run I would be playing retail.
---
Tis disappointing but I am not going to let it ruin vanilla hype for me. Just means a quicker IBS for me then ;)

Debatable. Look at how much that rogue moves after getting hit by a grenade. Later on when he finishes a Frostbolt and gets opened up on right after he also has a fire blast that takes like ~0.3-0.4s to finish and his blink takes almost that long to go off as well.
---
The average connection speed of people back in vanilla generated lots of weird shit. We had a feral druid on our server who was famous for lagging like fuck. He'd teleport all over the place around you and hitting him with a CoC while he was ontop of you was pretty much a dice roll. Dude was probably using a lag macro for that.
---
The range shown in that clip definitely doesn't qualify as your average experience anyway. Most PvP clips don't feature those kinds of ranges, so why does a handful of weird clips, which could very well involve laggy circumstances, prove the existence of such amount of leeway back then?

I was lucky she wanted nothing. I have all my assets. The divorce wasn't typical!
---
But if you do them as the opposite faction, I guess they should be at least  a 20 men raid, since a group of 10 people isn't enough to raid a capital city.
---
What are the other schools of thought on what the best raiding pet is?
---
You would go onto your realm's forum/discord and promote it there.
---
Doesn't that happen only on the AV servers. I thought players are "locked" in the main cities on that server
---
Yes and no. 
---
A Shadow Priest without Divine Fury is going to get sniped a lot more. And those 1 or 2 "useful abilities" are sometimes role defining, e.g. Nature's Swiftness.
---
But for the most part, you are correct. I would say it's 85% gear, 15% spec. 15% is not something to handwave away, however.
---
Does anyone know what modern hunter speed levelers use as a pet for leveling?
---
&gt; Will the guild or raid even be able to single me out? If so, how?
---
Easily, by looking at your ability usage, target selecting and positioning.
---
So what exactly do you discuss after everyone agrees retail is bad and nothing is changing after a long time? Just twiddle your thumbs and continue to say "yep retail is bad teehee". At some point you have to take the argument further to either force them to respond with reasons or force them to make a change.
---
The end of vanilla was filled with base rases... just because it doesn't align with your hopes and dreams - doesn't make it false or pessimistic.
---
Man, I hit 20 on my beta druid Thursday... cant wait for this AV weekend to be  over so I can play her more. The difference in kill speed was hugely noticeable.
---
Lolol I'm assuming you're joking. If not then this may be the dumbest comment on Reddit
---
That is the spirit! Now ninja loot the shield. FUCKEM
---
Carebear scum reeks of retail
---
I don't know the exact values, only that I would AoE my lower levels through the Stockades, on a 60 mage, and get around a level a run.
---
My memory got old, can't remember this, in vanilla/classic, is it possible to blink backward if you are walking backward while casting or this is just in retail?
---
Why are you like this?
---
Pretty wild, but with like a lot of Beta things happening - it will usually be exclusive to beta.
---
I need it for my enchants.
---
Razorgore and Vaelastrasz broke many many guilds back in vanilla.  
---
My guild hit the wall at Twin Emperors in AQ40 and 4Horsemen in Naxx (we were never able to kill either of those 2 bosses) but hitting the wall so far inside raids is somewhat ok, you can still get a decent amount of drops so people will keep raiding.  
---
But a lot of guilds hit the wall at Razorgore/Vaelastrasz and that means close to no epix from BWL and pretty soon people would stop showing up.
---
looks like some new thing blizz did where time shift actually changes the light color, whereas transitioning from day to night on classic wow was simply two forms of light
---
I have been thinking the same thing and I dont know why people are being rude. I see people say things like "you have to take engineering to pvp". I never had engineering and still dominated in pvp. Someone who is bad at their class and trys to throw a grenade is going to get stomped by the guy who loves to play a enhance shaman and is good at his class. 
---
I agree that a lot of people are putting way to much thought into race/class choices. Stone form is nice but it doesnt mean that you will automatically win against every hunter/rogue you encounter. Fear ward is nice but just because you pick a dwarf priest doesnt mean that a skilled warlock who is better at their char than you wont kill you. 
---
I think people should focus less on min/maxing everything and should spend time learning to play their classes well. If you can play your class really well then go ahead and add in all the extra stuff
---
Nah you go play BFA.
---
My buddy was my attorney his fee was we both pay for dinner and drinks. We three had dinner after it was done.
---
How does that follow at all?
---
You have yet to give any sort of justification for why encouraging others to improve is a bad thing.
---
you are not competing with warriors spamming execute with infinite rage from 66% onwards
---
Do you mean 1handed weapons? Wands have nothing to do with main hand, off hand or 2hand
---
I was thinking night elf as well
---
i mean most of what he sais is true. He's saying that most of what people assume in terms of decision making is quite innaccurate, which is usually why i tend to hold my opinion on pointing fingers at decision making unless its super obvious like the "you think you do" thing. And hes pretty correct because even as i scroll down the comments, everyone kinda missed the point.
---
Well, Deathwing for all intents and purposes has been called that longer than WoW has existed.  [https://youtu.be/E-KuHc7Lyt8?t=1460](https://youtu.be/E-KuHc7Lyt8?t=1460) (24:20) Malfurion in Warcraft 3 calls the black dragons fowl spawns of Deathwing.  
---
Though I do think some of it is pretty good ideas. I would like to see how blizzard goes about it all if they actually do it. It definitely feels like there was so much missing that they wanted to add, but just never got around to it. Kind of how I hated that we didn't get to see the whole Nerubian Kingdom in Wrath.
---
Oh damn, you're right. I scrounged for some beta footage of a Paladin with a swing timer addon running and found an example here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1RIk81XpvA&amp;t=1m42s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1RIk81XpvA&amp;t=1m42s)
---
Like *every* forum post I found on the subject implied that paladin judgements reset the cooldown, so I assumed it was a non-controversial mechanic. I guess the real answer to things resetting the swing timer is "it depends", same as a lot of classic mechanics. &gt;\_&lt;
---
Are you wondering if it has to do with like a ceiling they put in or something to prevent people from leaving? 
---
Maybe, but you get teleported back to the city as soon as you enter another zone though. But maybe
---
&gt;I was in a guild in BC and one time heard them badmouthing me by calling me a "Tryhard."
---
I would have /gquit on the spot and looked for a guild where trying hard wouldn't be seen as a bad thing.
---
Never seen this question here, - expansions are not a part of classic.  - they were apart of Vanilla and remain to be a big part of modern wow.
---
Why would they ever re do their same expansion line...
---
The fact that there are places where you can instakill enemy players with fall damage for one faction and (usually) not the other is the imbalance.
---
Something I really hate about the warlock is how it's essentially treated like a hybrid class even though they only have one role. They have no threat reduction abilities nor talents. All their end-tier talents are either useless or PvP only. Their tier gear is usually really bad for raiding, but good for PvP while their PvP gear is really good for raiding and not that great for PvP. The 16 slot debuff limit means they often can't use their dots or only a few of the locks can. Shadowbolt is a 3 second cast spell which means it only gets 87,51% of spellpower compared to mages fireball which gets 100%. Also did I mention that the hit talent only affects affliction spells? It is almost impossible to get hitcapped as a warlock and to do it you have to sacrifice other important stacks. So at BiS gear you still have a roughly 5-6% chance that your shadowbolt does nothing. Their pets are also fairly useless in raids, either buffing the group with stamina or not being out at all. 
---
So overall there are lots of annoyances in raiding. They are pretty fun in PvP though!
---
Holy fuck man! But a question, how high are you right now?
---
Because I'm not interested in having the same discussion again.
---
I'm a big fan of the nerubian underworld concept in WOTLK, sad it was never released and just ended up as linear dungeons
---
Why not be alarmist? I literally don't understand why people say shit like this. You should provide feedback based on what you are seeing, not what you hope/believe the system might turn out to be. If what you are seeing is very bad then you should be shouting from the hilltops about how it is very bad.
---
Glad I made an impression.
---
Clueless players choose Alliance
---
Case \*in\* point. Uneducated and ignorant indeed, can't even spell idioms right.
---
My fear is all the people who are so excited for this game and are taking time off to play when it releases just won’t have time to consistently play, and this type of gameplay won’t attract a lot of younger players these days to establish a consistent player base and it’ll turn into a niche game. Not that I think that’s going to happen, but if I have to pick a fear that would be it.
---
Shut up idiot.
---
You did not play vanilla, ass.
---
It's called balance. If they topped the charts,  it would be op. Why would you ever go melee if you can do the same damage at range?
---
If you are happy with the location of the action bars, great.
---
Personally, I want to keep the sides of my screen clear for quest tracker, party frames, and bag management. I also move my health and swing timers/cast bars/target health directly below my character, so it makes a lot of sense for me to have my action buttons there. That way, I can easily see and coordinate important resources, like cooldowns on major abilities or consumables. 
---
Honestly, I don't really like bongos (vanilla version)'s lack of easy keybinding, but it's a lot better than nothing. Back when I played wrath, I remember by that time there were mods out where you could just turn on a mode, hover over an action button on the bar, and press a key, and it would bind that button to that key. I miss those days.
---
I mean how else are you going to enchant that thundefury, large brills aren't cheap.
---
That's what I thought too, but I haven't seen anything other than this yellow lighting. There is no other time of day or night.
---
The radical change in TBC was having gear available at any tier for any spec.
---
If you wanted no changes just play on a private server and enjoy it that way, don’t ruin this chance to have a good retail wow for the rest of us.
---
It's not pessimist point of view, it's HOW IT WAS in vanilla after the AV nerfed, and it's HOW IT IS NOW in undocumented servers, speaking from experience.
---
&gt; I dont mind taking enchanting while leveling just to dispose of greens.
---
If that's your only use of enchanting, it's probably a better idea to get a bank alt to level 5 and give it enchanting.  You can mail it all your greens and disenchant works on any item.
---
Idc. I just want to play any form of classic lol
---
Nightmare fuel
---
So real
---
Dude you need to learn when to quit.  Every response you make reveals more of your idiocy.  Kek
---
Legolarz123 is a good option, if not taken already.
---
Get a good base of gold on your main to be able to purchase all skills while leveling, have good bags while leveling and be able to purchase boes from ah.
---
If you don't do these things you aren't leveling an alt efficiently.
---
Blink is great for when you get sent somewhere you don't have the fp for yet, too.
---
And for sure, way more useful than pyroblast.  To be able to even use pyro you'd have to be fire spec, so you're giving up +6% hit and all the control and survivability from frost to get it at 20.
---
Even then, you'd only ever open with it, so in the 6 second cast, you can either cast one pyro or be just about to finish your 3rd frost bolt, each of which do half of the direct damage of pyro for half of the cost in about one third of the cast time.  They also slow the target by 40% and each have a 15% chance to freeze the target for 5 seconds. Yeah no thanks, fire spec.
---
fuck Twin Emperors. Seriously fuck them. Also fuck the meme locks in my guild who couldn't tank the caster one for shit.
---
We didn't disband though, getting epics from 6 bosses was enough to keep people raiding. Got my Barb of the Sand Reaver off Fankriss, which is good because The Eye of Nerub never dropped for me.
---
Happy birthday and may your well fed buff carry you to victory.
---
Ummm... buddy this is internet
---
Oog oog
---
Wow, somehow I'd forgotten about this.
---
You can do but it'll be difficult to aoe grind on classic release, too many people. You can also AoE grind with a combination of nova, cone of cold and arcane explosion.. Maybe a cheeky flamestrike if you want so you don't *need* Blizzard.
---
I am totally for people doing whatever they want.
---
what do you mean?
---
People have said this was nerfed later in vanilla but I don't remember when it was nerfed.
---
title is missing a "were" or "are"
---
&gt;But this is the real world buddy
---
This is the US*
---
What you think is normal is not normal in the rest of the first world dude, this is less about "being human" and more about being american lmao
---
That's so fkn accurate!
---
Lol plebs
---
Thank you. This was exactly my point. You have examples, and I think you got your message across more clearly.
---
what? Wrath talent trees were just line vanilla and tbc, they were ridiculously long, then when cata came there would be so many talent rows they did 3 changes  
---
They made it so you chose which Spec you wanted to start with at 10, got some specific spec abilities and then you were locked in that tree until you got all the way to the bottom and then you could pick the rest.  
---
they also basically cut the talent tree in half because it was so long, and made it so you got 1 talent point every 2 lvls instead of 1.
---
Ignore the breath taking stupidity of people bitching because you're pointing out something in a literal fucking beta test. The lighting is very bright and has been in the beta as well, they either need to tune it down or add an option that doesn't involve a console command.
---
The hero we need.
---
Are you talking about bars? You can use a bar addon and get as many fucking slots as you'd like. You can also use modifier macros to fit multiple spells into the same button.
---
The Classic mindset. I seek to fully immerse myself as Nightlelf hunter in the year 2005.
---
You actually couldn't be more wrong. Blink is crucial in aoe pack grinding.
---
This is what I am here for.
---
FD doesn't work at all in av atm. Even on normal beta it sometimes had delay.
---
Why is this so touching?
---
Doing well and clearing raids fast/efficiently is fun for me. People not pressing their buttons and jumping around dancing is not a fun raid for me.
---
&gt;Classic is easier than retail of course but its not LFR easy.
---
Classic mechanics easier than LFR.   
---
it's also more punishing than LFR.
---
Classic is harder to make mistakes, but you make a mistake and you're dead. LFR is easier to make mistakes, but you can't die unless you try to.
---
The problem is tho, it will not like this when the AV is released in Classic (maybe in the beginning but not for long) because both sides will ignore each other and rush to the enemy base to kill the boss as fast as possible for the fast honor gain and PvP rank. It was like this near the end of vanilla and right now in pservers, if you fight and take objectives, your teammates will get mad because they want to finish the match in 5 mins for the best honor per minute.
---
I read somewhere that you could get skill-up points to 60 by DEing, but at higher skill perhaps it's not a point every time you DE? I'm sure someone here can confirm this or not.
---
Nothings wrong with it. It’s just people who are insecure full of cognitive dissonance making excuses to justify their either laziness or inadequacy. 
---
It’s like when you play a shooter and somebody goes “oh wow he’s using the optimal gun. Try hard....” or a fighter and somebody goes “haha you keep doing combos and shit, why are you try harding?”
---
Am I supposed to suck on purpose? Isn’t the point to like, have fun? It might sound crazy but you can have fun winning without being an elitist dick, and still optimizing your spec and play
---
I don't have beta but it SHOULD be 60 I believe.
---
Surprised you didn’t do high elf ruins for the Alliance base, since the only thing in the original Northern Lordaeron area was the coastal high elf ruins that they first build when coming to EK. Would be a good way to re-add the high elf faction that was originally planned for 1.6. I do still like this though.
---
I played on and off since 2005, but I'm not sure what this means. Is there something specific about the patch they're launching with that will make early raiding easier? Better talents, maybe?
---
so much exploit
---
Sorry this is sub is becoming toxic. I think it will get better once we can all play
---
Ill take option C. Add new stuff but keep the level cap at 60 and add gear laterally.
---
We all have different opinions. You choose to support someone that attempted to defraud the taxpayer of almost $1 million and I choose to expose him
---
\#TipsOutTruthsOut
---
What the fuck am I looking at
---
Problem with blink in vanilla is that if you were running up even the slightest incline blink would do absolutly nothing.
---
Yeah, all we got was these 2 dungeons and like a tiny little snippet of it at the end of Trial of the crusader. I always felt like we were cut short on it. Always wondered if they would ever go and update it, or maybe a future expansion having it, but I'm almost scared at how they may mess it up in the current game.
---
It's a retail glyph that allows you to blink in the direction you're moving.
---
Vanilla/Classic blinks go where your character is facing.
---
What I don’t understand is why they gave me access back on the launcher but I can’t click play.
---
Getting called an elitist by someone who doesn’t understand what they’re talking about.  Classic WoW *is* back!
---
I heard it didn't port you forward but yanked the caster in the direction he was moving in, like a big jump, but it was changed because exploits.
---
I've spoken my point clearly, and your response  makes it obvious that you are just holding your biased opinion close to your chest and you response is low effort.
---
I'll continue trying to educate you on the matter as long as I'm getting hints that you're applying yourself. So, why do you think *I* think that people "encouraging others to improve" can be a bad thing?
---
If you can't roughly guess my position then you're obviously trolling me or just wasting my time.
---
"...In an MMO of all things!"
---
elitist jerks was literally the most popular website for raiders back in the day, it was entirely about being a min/max sperg elitist.
---
I loved the old animation on my troll in vanilla. I think it changed in BC? It looked awful, especially when sprinting. Sprinting while stealthed was a lot more fluid before the change as well.
---
Uh huh im saving theese threads later . If for some god forsaken luck (or the 15 ppl who are hard carrying ur raid)  you made it through MC and step into BWL , you'll rethink your life choices :'DDDDDDDDD
---
The only thing I like better about the modern models is that my orc can finally stand up straight.
---
Incredibly useful for mobility.  Considering you dont get a mount till 40. Plus if your on a pvp server mages compared to other classes are extremely slippery

---
Care bear princess lol
---
What do you consider "more successful"?   
---
Are you talking about subs...or subs per capita?
---
Because Vanilla and BC(Which were pretty high on world pvp) weren't available to as many people yet they had extremely high subscriber count.
---
Pretty sure bear is better since you can dot and pull more mobs. So you effectively kill the mobs faster.
---
This is your answer.
---
Everyone is saying Nelf, but I have to recommend tauren, there is like 0 benefit of a tauren hunter in pve and the larger hitbox is pretty bad for pvp. 
---
I mained a Tauren hunter vanilla-wotlk, and I think literally any other class would have been better. 
---
Get that pink plainstrider too, that was my pet through vanilla before I got shamed by my guild into getting a beneficial one.
---
Also make sure to pick up the Ravager from SM to really up your melee game.

difficult OMEGALUL
---
Clearly you didn't actually play a mage in vanilla. Backward blinks weren't out of the ordinary based on just what pathing was feeling like at your current spot.
---
Make the middle of the ocean a butthole.
---
lol, you think blizz actually had things balanced?
---
Crossrealm bgs were the beginning of being able to actually enjoy doing mostly PvP. Queueing for hours was just not worth it. And it's not like all realms are connected so you still learn the other regulars.
---
At any rate, we are getting a game mostly based on 1.12 good and bad.
---
I haven't seen that interview in a few years. Damn
---
Great points and I dare say his memory may slightly live on given that we’re still talking about him now! But we’ll see what happens upon release and what kind of activity they may have given rise to.
---
Having raided as a priest through BC and WotLK my experience was a rewarding one, but also a bit of an under appreciated one. When everyone is being kept healed, nobody batters an eye and forgets the healers are there, but when shit starts to hit the fan and some people start dying the blame can quickly shift to the healers so there is a lot of responsibility. If you stop paying attention for 2 seconds and accidentally let someone drop too low then you kinda sit there and think oops shit. 
---
It is truly rewarding though when you bring someone back up after they thought it was game over for them. This applies in pvp too :)
---
It's not.
---
I dunno man, I was doing wrath -&gt; moonfire -&gt; bear -&gt; maul til death and I took more damage doing than than I do just walking up to mobs in cat form and clawing them to death.
---
I vaguely remember a time around cataclysm that the original animation came back for maybe a patch or so. I was so happy that they finally changed it back to how it was, until it got changed into what we have now again =(. This and the charge animation not using the walking animation are honestly kinda huge for me. RIP
---

Don't know him
---
Yah, I remember the tanks complaining about this.
---
That's the point sir.
---
Taurent Hunter, because thats what I did when i first played vanilla. And I was literally CLUELESS :)
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Is what you are saying true? Are the mobs easier than they were?
---
Lol, okay. He got banned cause a fuckton of people reported his post and you've got your tinfoil hat on.
---
People have gotten a lot better at mmo's over the past 15 years. An mc mechanic is basically an LFR mechanic at this point, and a naxx mechanic might be equivalent to normal/heroic. There's a reason that on private servers they typically bumped up some stats on bosses.
---
Since when can you add numbers to your name
---
Awesome I’ll add you later
---
Because they cant
---
I wasn't aware he was including rare bugs in his question?
---
Backwards blinks were location and ping specific and frankly rare. One or two usually every 100 blinks.
---
They were also not reproducible.
---
I played a mage ALL of Vanilla and not only does nothing in my post show I didn't, but nothing in my post is wrong either.
---
So you're saying the old models are bad and the new models are bad too? 
---
Wut
---
You haven't spoken your point clearly.
---
You have yet to come up with a reason for why it might negatively impact anyone.
---
bajs DansGame
---
It also takes a higher cut from the neutral AH. Like 15% i think
---
Larger hitbox is a pure advantage since you can mostly turn it on and off at will when it's convenient including for escaping your deadzone without moving
---
It does
---
&gt;Sacrificing server community and rivalries for shorter battleground queue times is a bad thing. Burning out on grinding battlegrounds just for some extra honor or faction rep is not good in the long run. This needs to be changed.
---
Blizzard does not care.
---
They only want to cater to the "I should be able to play whenever I want to" crowd.
---
Which is why we have layering for all of phase 1.
---
&gt;But it is definitely not “optimal”
---
not optimal for the single person.  
---
But as a guild you'll have Perdition's Blades,Core Hound Tooths, and Gutgore Rippers drop and if your dps rogues won't take them because they want Vis'kags and Brutality  Blades as a guild you're worse off, because then you have your rogues competing with your fury warriors for weapons, and not enough of them to go around.
---
&gt; ​It won’t require a lot of work, won’t create a lot of bugs
---
HAHAHAHAHA....
---
This is the code that completely shattered when they tried to simply increase the backpack size. 
---
The simple answer is they don't have that data so it would be making guesses to what is correct.
---
That rogue is from TBC. No wonder he's so good in classic.
---
Yeah this rings a bit, I think it should work like that
---
Go outside
---
I'm not a good one to ask I think.  I've always thought as a game aged that vertical progression was the only way for a non sandbox mmo to progress.  Wow from it's beginning was about viewing the content and moving on to the new content.  This brings in the challenge of making content relevant for long stretches difficult .  not sure what the answer is.  You can make a fun and memorable 25 to 35 zone but players will realistically only be in the zone for a few days.  I'm not sure this is reason to not make the zone or not.   Max level zones with contested / farmable resources tend to get the most use.  
---
I'm rambling here but the main takeaway is what is the purpose of these zones?  Adding to the immersion / diversity of a leveling play through?  Challenging the player? Or simply being an efficient route to fill gaps in questing lulls like alliance around L30?  I'm not sure how to answe it well.  Everquest's answer was to make old zones relevant through long quest chains with mobs with low spawn and drop percentages.  These items maintained their usefulness for long periods (years) and were eventually so memorable and beloved that eq2 heritage quest items became some of the most memorable portions of that game as well.  WoW in vanilla has trinkets and toys and relics that were much this way that were later retroactively nerfed and level capped.  One of the great errors I think they made in itemization.  The other main one being procedurally generated gear based on ilvl and stat templates.  Not all gear needs to be BIS for all situations and not all gear needs to come from tje newest content tier.   
---
Rambling again.  Why are these new zones specifically being made?  Vanilla is already very content rich in the low end of the overworld.  Without more vertical content progression (gear, levels) it's difficult to keep the players focused .
---
They really can't put 8 debuff for the 2 first stage or revert temporarly threat to the earlier version ?
---
&gt;So, combat daggers and combat sword both makes exactly the SAME dps? because if you is 1100 and the other one is 1200, and you choose the 1100, you are gimping yourself and not being optimal.
---
As a Raid Leader I'd much rather have the rogue doing 1100 if it means he's not competing with fury warriors for weapons.
---
That sounds like a good use of funds.  My heart is warm knowing that they aren't all just nonsense
---
People have compared private server mob stats to classic stats and on average classic stats are higher for most world mobs. So it seems pretty unlikely mobs have gotten easier, they were just never that difficult to begin with.
---
Lol nice - checked this out.
---
After you kill a person a couple times you get no honor from them.  The objectives are also finished or stuck in a stalemate in long games. So there is no point to sitting in a long AV if your goal is to get honor.
---
Every PvPer that was serious about honor farming did WSG and AB premades.  Outside of AV weekend and people farming reputation AV was pretty deserted on a lot of servers.
---
It was so unpopular it was changed to the 1.12 version.
---
Because it's their game and they can do whatever they want.
---
If they wanted to add summoning stones (which don't belong) it wouldn't matter if people didn't want it.
---
They do as they please.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Every 2 levels!
---
Hunter masterclass.
---
I was alliance on Mal'Ganis and remember horde dominating AV 99% of the time, but regularly getting turtled at bridge. I think I get exalted without winning a single game.
---
&gt;Don't kill my karma please, it's only a question : Why they just release a raw 1.12 ?
---
Same reason we have layering in for the entire first phase - it's 2019 and blizzard wants to please the consumer.
---
Exactly, and that is ultimately was killed WoW. Game design and socializing disappeared. How can anyone on this forum defend it. Crossrealm battlegrounds were not really Classic. Arena was actually in Classic WoW during the last patch. Does that mean players should be able to queue for Arena?
---
Yeah im considering modding it for new models. Current stance is that if they have a problem with it, you'll get a warning first.
---
I haven't tamed it myself but I have seen another hunter with it.

---
You *are* complaining that you need a carrot on a stick for WPvP. Do it because it's fun like a normal person would. This mentality that *all* content *must* reward you to be worthwhile is why Retail WoW is the way it is.
---
I dunno what shit tier servers you were on, but world PvP was always happening in Vanilla WoW for me. It was always present. I even got tired of leveling with ganking and rolled on a RP server after WotLK launched.
---
Besides, if you want to pretend it's for the casual gamers? Having WPvP give more honor wouldn't be as queuing for a BG is far quicker than trying to find other lvl 60s to gank in the overworld.
---
Should have good, set in stone rules for the exceptions to avoid drama for sure
---
Nice,  thx for the reply
---
They were in vanilla - it's not like they added it in TBC and are bringing into classic.
---
If players could queue and enter Arenas before TBC, then yup it's fair game.
---
Your character looks like he would sell fake Rolex watches on the street.
---
Fuck that.
---
What's this dramatic change in threat that happened in 1.11? I know shield slam got a buff that took it from useless to just ok - but other than that what changed?  
---
Simliarly the difference between 8 debuffs and 16 debuffs is very small. 8 allows for all of the important debuffs. Sunder, FF, CoR, CoS, CoE, WC, Imp SB - that's only 7 and is 90% of the important stuff for raid dps. If you can't kill a boss with 8, it's very unlikely 16 will help. If you can kill it with 16, going to 8 won't stop you.  
---
The point is a fundamental game mechanic like allowed debuff slots shouldn't be changing between patches unless you have a really good reason - it's just confusing and annoying to have it change. With that in mind you just don't gain enough switching it randomly one phase in Classic - the only reason to do so would be to appease angry players that think Blizzard isn't remaking Classic as they want. The difference to gameplay would be completely insignificant.
---
&gt;Nobody says you will not be able to raid. You are attacking the strawman. The point is it is a choice you might end up regretting because 300 vs 305 weapon skill is   
---
&gt;huge and cannot be easily compensated for through gear.
---
Less important for Orcs because 1h axes are weirdly itemized, and the bis gear is almost always Swords.
---
Barrens = Serengeti
---
So do you want to work with me on the patches and what the zones/instances  in them would look like and add your ideas to it ?
---
&gt;They can. Back in the days, one of the 1st mechanics you had to learn, was kind of a fade away jump-shot, that means, you run forward, jump up, turn urself while still in the air backwards, shoot, turn still in the air forwards, and run away...
---
That's what you responded to. That post is 100% correct in describing how you move and shoot in WoW classic.
---
&gt; It won’t require a lot of work, won’t create a lot of bugs 
---
You could just offen them that you'll do it if it won't require a lot of work and won't create a lot of bugs
---
The rets and boomkins weren't brought for dps'ing back in classic though, they were brought for healing, buffs, cleanse, etc. I played as ret the entirety of classic and killed every boss but Vicidus. I was always one of the best healers even with my spec. I had full AQ gear and a hand of rag and I still never DPSd in raids unless it was like a drunken MC/BWL clear for fun on a weekend night. It was really hard for even non holy paladins to run oom with the right mp/5 gear in classic.
---
Imagine being this upset over a beta
---
lol "I'm not gonna argue once I realize I'm wrong"
---
Don't equate Layering with CR. CR was a cancer that killed the community. Layering is simply different physical instances to allow people to have access to the content without a horde of people creating bottlebecks. They are still all on the same server.
---
The last patch of vanilla was the pre tbc patch, which is why it started with 2.x.x. Also, cross realm bgs were in vanilla for nearly 1/3 of its lifespan, not sure how you can say they're not vanilla at that point.
---
I mean I understand scepticism. But this was questioned the first day of beta and proven to be false. They are the same as vanilla. It was proven several times, reports from blizzard as well as video proof from several sources (don't have them I just remember watching them a few weeks ago). 
---
It's very possible that maybe we got better at gaming in 15 years and that same mob is easier to kill now that we understand gearing, talents, and have pure skill increase.
---
have you levelled a character in vanilla? there wasn't even enough quests to reach 60 for the first few patches. Also you get bottlenecked so often into huge, unavoidable zones you might hate(the barrens, stranglthorn vale,) or reach a point where you hit a quest drought level 30-ish for alliance and around level 45 for both factions are some good examples. So to avoid that is the main reason few more zones would help in my opinion, allowing people to go where they want to go and pick there own adventures always felt like a very vanilla concept to me (6 different starting zones for example), as opposed to the newer expansions where everyone does the same content and plays the same game as everyone else.
---
No Contest? Or were you part of a different Horde group/guild?
---
Evocation no drinking, cast a polymorph if it resists then I’m blinking
---
It will depend on population and if you manage to get ahead of the curve level wise. Hopefully concurrent players online will be much lower than private servers, but respawn rates not being accelerated expect to be waiting for certain quest mobs to respawn while in a group that may even be competing for tags.
---
Remember quest items often have a low drop chance and only dropped for one player in the group on top. I suspect on a high pop server it will be less of an issue but still regular at 40-50
---
Asmongold has been leading the charge that BFA is trash,  I didn't do that, if anything I should be in front of him in line.
---
&gt; Casual players also don't want to have to spend a month getting to 60, they want to be able to transmog their clown suit, and they want flying mounts because running around Azeroth is too tedious. Why break away from the principles of vanilla WoW to cater to casual players in some ways but not others?
---
You do realise that vanilla wow was successful *because* of casual players? WoW was released as a casual MMO, and indeed it was vastly more casual than any of the offerings in the MMO market at the time. Casual players don't necessarily want transmogs or easy mounts or anything else you mentioned. If casual players enjoyed vanilla then I have no doubts they'll enjoy Classic.
---
&gt;More doomsday bullshit. Current private server players could fill multiple Classic servers. Why would Classic be less successful than private servers?
---
*Because Classic costs money. Private servers don't.*
---
&gt;And like I mentioned before, even if this did somehow happen, server merges are still preferable to layering.
---
People hated server merges back in vanilla because it meant losing your community, no matter how small it was. Given that people insist that the community aspect is a huge part of what makes Classic so good, anything that attacks the community aspect is a bad idea.
---
Altervista is the one I always use
---
&gt;So what exactly do you discuss after everyone agrees retail is bad and nothing is changing after a long time? 
---
You cancel your subscription.  
---
&gt;At some point you have to take the argument further to either force them to respond with reasons or force them to make a change. 
---
If a company has their head and the sand and ignores rational community feedback, its on them. Escalating by attacking the company's motives or personally targeting their leadership does nothing but contribute towards a toxic community and drives an even bigger wedge between the developers and the fan base.  
---
I guess a lot of people feel the need to "force" Blizzard to change since they still long for the WoW that \_was\_. But at the end of the day I think some people just have to accept that if a product they once liked becomes bad, they just need to let go.
---
You're doing math wrong
---
It was always so hard for me in vanilla to pick and choose spells. I always left frost nova after level 1 on there to save towards my mount.
---
Blizzard decided to stick with 1.12. The number of debuffs doesn't matter in the end of the day. Neither does progressive itemization. There's no challenge in MC/BWL.
---
But I agree it's slightly odd that Blizz aren't even trying to make stuff more authentic, while even private server tried.
---
Get a proper chair like a Leap or an Aeron

I really hope they sort it out then

What if this was the 10th post of his they have had to deal with?

And you're clearly insane

Yeah, once people are actually trying to grind Honor levels, there will be a unspoken agreement to just zerg to the end to maximize gains.. I wouldn't be surprised to see pre-mades popping up to trade wins tbh
---
Tauren Hunter. Biggest model, Warstomp isn't that useful cause of the cast time and being in melee range is where you never want to be. It's also the first hunter I made. A big fat white cow with a tiger pet.

I can't wait to come across some care bears and then proceed to kill and camp them :D

Maybe it's the right move for YouTube, wish you success anyway.
---
In my experience doing nice things like this as the troll did. I would be ganked and camped by an Alliance player shortly after this clip.
---
oh wow, how did you figure this stuff out?
---
&gt;In today's retail, seemingly everyone you run into is a try hard douche.
---
Because the game is fucking god awful unless you're playing hardcore with a guild. Hardcore 10+ year players are the only ones playing the goddamn game, there are no casuals because the casual content sucks fucking dick. I'm not raiding RN, I dont want to, I could make time but would rather do other things, I would be playing casually RN if the game is good, and I would be pretty laid back about it too, but the game isn't good enough to be subbed for casual content. Every aspect of the game feeds into competitive ladders of some sort and its fucking bullshit. There's no way to appreciate retail in any way but hardcore. If I wanted to play casually in a MMO I would play FFXIV, which many, many players are doing. 
---
There's a lot of reasons this is the case.
---
i mean as a tank i will maintain it and shit but you can still use it and get the threat honestly an imp ea rogue is way better to have than just the sunders because it is more armor reduction.
---
You got the xbow from the Korrak quest, didn't have to complete the battle. It could still be hard if Korrak was already killed with no new AV's starting and the current ones stuck, which meant you had to wait, not spend days in there at least.
---
I had lots of fun in the old AV's gathering a small group of 5-10 people breaking the stalemate by capping towers and graveyards behind enemy lines.
---
I like how you're trying to make people who want to actually play the game the bad guys here.
---
Everyone's saying you can D/E lvl 60 gear with level 1 enchanting. I could be remembering wrong but I deffinitly recall people not being able to D/E gear because low level enchanting.
---
Why not just make a /w addon that spams your copy pasta and auto invites anyone saying sure, ok, yes, inv etc
---
For the allia-
---
All with the same goal - little to no queues.
---
But neglect the truth if you must.
---
How so?
---
Not my dreams just my expectations.
---
It's the newer version of AV. I never got to experience old week long AVs.
---
 It might be cool to do throwback week at some point in classic and bring out old AV. Or would that be too much change?
---
For the last time, I \*did\* explain myself, and in the original post.   
---
\&gt;  for every hardcore player with no life and a lot of game knowledge,  there are ten parrots who say all the usual pro-min max stuff and harbor  the same, \*\*usually toxic attitude\*\* without just about any of the  justification for doing so.   
---
\&gt;  Tldr: every guild and raid has a culture, sometimes min max is *expected*, sometimes it's \*\*inappropriate.\*\*   
---
Here I laid out my position. Every game with a competitive  elite has copy cats who bring with them toxic attitude and harassment of players that don't min max.   
---
My issue is not with min-maxing, it's with the casual min-maxers who only use the aspects of min max that fits their narrative. (Criticize others sub-optimal decisions while selective ignoring ones own poor decisions.)   
---
You see it every day in just about any online game. LoL, overwatch, wow, pubg, the list goes on. People saying "we lost the game because \_\_\_\_ person didn't get teleport, which is the agreed upon standard"   
---
When sure, teleport IS the agreed upon standard, but also YOU made 10+ critical errors, didn't ward, had poorgame sense and missed smite.. So is the teleport criticism a genuine aspiration to improve? No. They mention teleport when the game is over, only because the game went poorly, and they mention it to a pub player whom they likely will never play with again. The point of the criticism in this context is to deflect blame to anonymous players. It's a self-comforting thing, and we'll see it in WoW just like in any other game, and it's a bad thing
---
Just digging through the relational tables and putting the proper indices together.
---
Other players dont want to improve and are satisfied with where they are on the progression ladder. If they are comfortable and dont want to change, you shouldn't expect them to change. 
---
You cant make a whore a housewife, just like you can't make a shitter with 2 kids and a job a world first raider. If you want to play competitively, dont play in non-competitive guilds.
---
Clearly you're sensitive enough to get shook over some random dudes words on the internet lul
---
it was a stupid joke bro, no defensive stance needed
---
I am not sure why the tank didn't like it.   I believe that he thought he wasn't getting the threat from sunder, because of it?  idk.
---
Yup - I can't wait to see kill trading all throughout phase 2 - major reason for me going PvE server with still going hard in pvp when bgs release- all the grinding nerds just going to kill trade 16 hours a day during phase 2.
---
For threat i can't tell but switch 16 to 8 debuff is just a value, no ?
---
Take my upvote, i watched a stream last night and noticed this... Was kinda hard to watch because of it.
---
Because it's feminine and so only healers like it because girls are healers. I'm gonna make shamans pitch black, because nature is metal /s
---
I don't create the truth. It is what it is.
---
Then what is? Care to enlighten?
---
but the average wow guild will not care. that's the point.  
---
Anyone who seriously care about progression WILL clear anything Vanilla has to offer.
---
And u dont even use pyroblast over fireblast so...
---
I played from Vanilla to the end of Cata. 
---
Got into the classic beta and uninstalled it two days later. No thanks.
---
And as someone who played Warlock in vanilla it's absolutely ridiculous when people want to force you to take epics that are inferior to blues that have +dmg.
---
I had never seen Annihilator listed on EJ.  I have only seen it in regards to post-vanilla PServer theory sheets.
---
There are no good guys bad guys - it's blizzard and the consumer base - players have a voice and blizzard has the right to choose whether or not to listen to what the community says / wants.
---
Anyone upset with how Classic is going to be handled - are delusional if they think blizzard will go against the casual choice.
---
I remember being wanted as an enchanter in a dungeon because I could DE. Now enchanters just get screwed. Blizzard really farked this game up
---
I can't look at the new models without cringing. They don't look like Warcraft models.
---
This change came with tbc I think
---
Being properly geared was a challenge, no ?
---
I mean even if there is a boss with 0 mechanics, if he have a lot HP and deal a lot of damage he is gonna be hard (Patchwerk ?) because it require a lot of gear/preparation to kill him
---
Being full BiS in 1.1 for MC versus in 1.12 is probably a huge advantage no ?
---
On the Google play store there is an app where you can make builds, save them or kust check out talent trees
---
Very practical to use on your phone!
---
Absolutely. It reminds me of mobas, when a member criticizes a characters item purchase decision, in a game where seemingly everyone in the game made 100 mistakes and are clearly rookie. Like, what are you doing talking shit about a 10% opitimization issue with my item when you're failing over and over again in game?
---
Lol love the comments keep them coming nahahaha
---
&gt;If you show up to MC expecting loot when you're wearing a ton of greens
---
funnily enough most casters pre raid bis lists include quite a bit of greens.
---
Not as good as if you joined the BG 5 hours in.
---
I remember in BC solo capping snowfall as horde warlock to turn the game in to a turtle.

Don't play classic then cry baby. Xrealm bgs are very good.

To please the consumer or to please the type of consumming in 2019 ? :p
---
It was possible in Vanilla post-nerf too.
---
should be pretty simple to compare with private servers
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.classic_talents sorry if that doesnt work I total noob. Found this on reddit the other day and it's very simple, easy to use and it looks good

Clever use of in game mechanics. Naw
---
Players could queue for Arena before TBC.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnl7h45CmH4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnl7h45CmH4)

Xrealm bgs doesn't even kill the server community lmao. It exists everywhere else. If you wanna pvp with ppl on your server only then go wander around the zones, it's real simple.
---
You'r a disgrace to the Horde!
---
Lmao I thought I was having the time of my life back in the day... I was, just turns out I was also sheltering myself from a lot of sorely needed personal growth.
---
I mean I'm not the one writing every profane word I can think of about someone not sharing their opinion. Take your high horse somewhere else it doesnt suit you here.
---
I've heard about some classes like hunter, but here are my preferences:
---
\- Usable in both PvP &amp; PvE (must, as I often like playing with other people)
---
\- Decent survivability, not squishy &amp; not easily punished (must, tanks are optional as they seem nice for me)
---
\- #1 choice: Strong ranged DPS attacks, #2 close quarters melee or #3 ranged DPS melee (either one of those)
---
\- Worgen = &lt;3 (highly optional)
---
If you got some class suggestions, also state what their disadvantages are for an easier decision, thanks in advance
---
&gt;There are so many more aspects of classic that makes it harder than retail.
---
Care to name one?
---
best comment in this thread lol
---
Pretty sure people just farm trash now to get rep.
---
No, just pointing out the fact there is no reason to be an asshole. But asmongold breeds that so what do I expect
---
Not saying it's fake - but 99 views from 2009 seems odd.
---
You'd think that a pre patch arena video would be more poppin back then.
---
yeah i am not sure why he wouldn't. Probably because he is not familiar how the threat works.
---
All it mostly comes down to is mana problems with both spriest and boomkin. Even using mana pots on cooldown and doing all I could to try to have mana, I just couldn't be competitive with my dps without going oom.
---
Damn thats alot of training needed.
---
Blink moves you 20 yards in the direction you're facing. Unless you hit a branch or a rock or a pebble or blizzard just doesn't want you to move.
---
I am not complaining. Im just saying how it easy. Im fine with it being that way.
---
Not Even, naxx mechanics are more equivilant to lfr Than mc. However, much more punishing to fuck up in naxx
---
TIL nipples can take meth
---
Traitorous shit that people will do in classic -
---
I got tons more videos. I remember how it was. Arena was in Classic WoW.
---
Start the petition to bring it back.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwjQaJ5xt1o
---
Yea, melee leeway, sharding, fucked pets, BFA client - right now private servers feel way more like vanilla wow than classic.
---
Waiting 1-2 hours for a BG that lasts 30 minutes is just not fun
---
I'd argue that seeing as bgs will be cross realm, the long AVs wouldn't really be the same anyway. You're not pushing against the other faction on your server.
---
Because Threat is the biggest crutch that DPS have. And being to put out more TPS equates to more DPS from your raid. So the harder you can threat the faster you can kill bosses. Overall decreasing your time you need to spend in raids.
---
There was literally an article posted about Blizzard that stated a majority hated it. In one of my recent posts, I said I think people like the old style of AV with day long matches is because nostalgia. Nobody ever saw that before, it was insane and crazy. And people thought it was funny. And so they want to see it again. Partake though? After a few matches it’ll get boring, quick.
---
I loved old AV, but if the game length could be like 2-3 hours, I’d do it as much as I could. I don’t think many people like playing a game, any game, where there’s an objective to win, but you never reach it, or when you do, it takes much much much longer than you want. The majority of polls are nostalgia based. Give people the opportunity to play those matches, their tune will change.
---
I was watching Swifty (and so happened to be in his AV as well) and he was even saying “damn, this game has gone on for more than 2 hours. Are we gonna win this?” And that’s the feeling. It looks and sounds fun until you start doing it, then it’s a completely different story.
---
Not watching that...  Tell me what is wrong.
---
Who the hell has 6 hours to spend like that lmao
---
It would have to be full Frost.
---
This was Vanilla, so who knows.
---
Going to try and nab something like Merlin or Arthur.
---
There’s another type of out of bounds tech they changed in Legion.
---
I’d need to dig up to quote about it from Blizz, but essentially, pre-Legion they used like invisible blocks or walls to prevent out of bound travel.
---
Mid-Legion they switched from walls to some sort of more advanced construct (I vaguely remember it being referenced as webbing) that creates a barrier behind the barrier. This was added to prevent Demon Hunter shenanigans, since they could occasionally jump over certain invisible walls. 
---
I wouldn’t be shocked of that chance was the culprit in this case. 
---
In the interim I’ll if I can find that discussion and post it via an edit, if I can pin it down.
---
Rested Bonus + Cheap Potions (Swiftness / Rage Pots for Warrior) + Health / Mana pots makes leveling extremely easy. If every 10-20 levels you can upgrade your gear a little it also helps.
---
Yup ALL THE TIME. We got so mad lol
---
The common arguement was "WHY DONT THEY JUST RACE US FOR THE REP GRIND?!"
---
Hunters can also solo mobs like 20 levels higher than them, so it evens out.
---
Yup, loved this back in the days
---
True where knowledge base was limited.
---
But... but... no changes?
---
I mean normal on retail is extremely easy, so me saying naxx is equivalent to normal isn't really a compliment. :p
---
I don’t see how that is possible. You have less armor while In cat form. So how could you take less damage with less defenses?
---
Beta bugs or something?
---
Everywhere
---
Lol they wont add micro transactions you have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
I can’t wait to kill gnomes. I live to see them die
---
I just afked from a game with Asmongold. It was useless, slow and 80% of the healers was focused on keeping him alive. He was even marked. It made the game painfully slow, with no chance of victory.  
---
Thank god I'm EU based, so I won't have to deal with that kind of gameplay/mentality.
---
They’re using 16 slots because they want to. The only reason 8 was ever a thing was because design limitations, not because it’s something they wanted to do.
---
You cant.
---
Do you understand what's going on? BFA is closer to classic than vanilla client, so you're better off logging into BFA and doing whatever you think will help, and there's no way it's gonna be any actual use to you.
---
In my experience, horde use a cat
---
Idk I think Hunter is also incredible. Aspect of the Cheetah is huge and so is Growl (Rank 2). Level 20 gives a huge boost to leveling speed.
---
See you don't even know if it's just a number or not. So how can you assume it won't require a lot of work and won't create a lot of bugs if you don't even know what it is?
---
The funny thing is the old ones made no sense. The feet literally slid across the ground to match that animation movement speed. The new version actually keeps feet anchored where they landed, even if it looks a bit silly overall.
---
&gt;  If a game feature is so dramatic that it literally discourages players to roll an entire class, something has to change. 
---
no. not in this game
---
Not going to run well.
---
I'd go to craigslist and look for a used gaming system that's a couple years old.
---
This time of year people unload them for dirt cheap since schools out and they think they won't be gaming all summer so they want cash instead.
---
Yus fix please
---
No but mechanics wise even lfr has a lot more going on than naxx. But yea normal is very easy and I'd say naxx and some of aq40 is still harder than normal on retail.
---
I doubt you'll have that much fun intentionally being 'clueless' after a while when everyone on your realm knows whats up. But hey, you do you :)
---
People seem to forget that we were all shit during classic.
---
This is just the same old Horde propaganda.
---
Owl
---
I prefer the newer animations, imo sliding across the floor looks stupid, but it's correct.  
---
Old animations should be restored for Classic because that's what existed in Vanilla.
---
They reverted the flight point beasts' pitch, roll and yaw but Retail still has them static which surprises me.
---
Should Druids get the new skins?  
---
Should male Orcs have the option to stand up straight?  
---
They are, subjectively, better looking models, but no, they weren't in Vanilla so they shouldn't be in Classic.
---
/console ffxglow 0

that will fix a lot of weird lighting.

Iirc the extra stealth from the Nelf isn't really that great. Stone form, however, is awesome.
---
Plus Pyro if you spec fire
---
Jokes on you, I'll just be on a PvE server!
---
&gt;the guy playing ret paladin is probably not a stubborn skilled player
---
Ret players are either super tryhard or fucking worthless. There's no inbetween. There's such a big knowledge barrier between good and bad rets. If they have SP gear on, they know their shit, if they have STR gear and a slow 2h, they're hot garbage. 
---
\-Ret Paladin.
---
Oh bro.. it's not really that important..
---
There is a group called hydra and I think you're thinking about them. I started with then back on WOD and ended up leading premade ashrans. They would make premade AVs a couple times a week and it was a ton of fun! We wouldn't cap and towers, just kill alliance scum :P there were some crazy battles that happened and crazier moments. We would have a lot of DKs and push all the way to their tunnel and camp there and then death grip chain anyone who slipped past.
---
Thank you for your service, Xlegolasxx.

Everyone did this in vanilla. I would literally have groups competing for my mage in ubrs runs. It was kinda hilarious. While all the undead rogues and hunters were trying to get into runs, there were no slots for them. But I almost never had trouble getting into or starting a run.
---
Stone form is better but night elf is God tier - you can't front flip on butterball dwarves.
---
What do you mean from he's TBC?
---
Mobs don't do damage when they're dead.
---
Greater Blessings are fire and forget buff that targets every class. You have 8 GCDs dedicated to blessing your raid pre-pull, and you cant drop combat to res in 1.12. You dont need to rebuff at any point with a 30m buff duration. You also cant stay out of combat to res, that mechanic was obliterated pretty early on, well before 1.12.
---
I know it’s not technically classic, but gilneas is Europe (maybe around Tudor period but not necessarily UK)
---
Shadowmeld isn't worth it for a rogue. It's worth 1 point in Master of Deception and only works if you don't move.
---
Stoneform is great against warriors and other rogues.
---
But I still don't consider it better than Escape Artist.
---
And the notion that ‘phew flassic is pissi easy no mechanics’ its not like raids today got lots of hard mechanics and people still die in fire or dont look away..lmao
---
Gnome.
---
Unfortunately nelf stealth bonus is very week, they're easily the worst rogue race.
---
That was my first guess! Josh Corbett (countdown to classic) is taking his 5 weeks too
---
this is awesome, thanks.
---
Oh I’m just gonna work my 40 for the second week, and the first week I’m taking my pto
---
Ahh, a Man of culture.
---
I was going to play a rogue again, until I saw this. Really need the slow animation back, I was so annoyed when they changed that.
---
It's a PSA to everyone, whether they want to hear or abide by it or not. It's discussing a paradigm change between retail and classic and a pretty important one at that -- persistent community matters -- and it's your job, not Blizzard's to make it. 
---
What exactly are you trying to get across here?
---
Travel form is at 30 right?
---
The streamer servers are going to be known 2 weeks beforehand when names are reserved.
---
This is pserver after all.0
---
Holy shit. I always thought they looked like characters and was waiting for someone to one day make them into just that. I was hoping for an animation though.
---
Excuse you my gnome is an absolute gentlemen.
---
I’ve spent a tiny amount of time reading up on the Retail exploration community.
---
They regularly reference a technology called “Sticky Walls”, which is the stuff that replaced the old invisible walls a while ago (based on posts it happened either during Legion, or right before it.)
---
Almost wonder if the import process replaces the old invisible sections with updated ones built on that stick wall tech, and in doing so inadvertently built a path.
---
Does Classic stoneform remove bleeds etc that are already on you? or only prevent new ones from applying during the duration?
---
Nelf
---
You left out the best thing you get at level 20: Teleport!
---
Yea EA would prevent Sunder from even being allowed to be cast iirc.  This would kill early warrior tank threat because sunder was such high Threat per Rage.
---
On Vanilla launch the names I wanted were restricted or taken.. I used the ingame random name generator and my wow characters have always been that or a slight variation on it since.. will be the same for classic.
---
Hard disagree bud
---
I'm still not understanding I guess, so i'll bite. What change(s) do you want to see?
---
Wait what??
---
Okay good. I forgot about tier sets, thanks bfa.
---
But well, me having 5 fps in raids is not that uncommon tho. Even in high end raid screenshots/videos people are having 12 fps... and thats naxx level. (as far as ive seen)
---
Ofcourse some people were lucky to have the money or parents to buy a very high end pc but majority didnt have that. I never whined about my fps tho, it was only that low in raids and everywhere else it was more than tolerable... 20fps+ (kids of this day and age will not understand 20 fps being decent :P).
---
What was yours? if i may ask. Its always interesting to know.
---
I think stoneform is better, but only slightly.  I would choose based on which pixels you will want to stare at for a lot of days of /played time.
---
I commented it afterwards.
---
Yea cause they haven't don't anything rash in the past, I forgot, and server transfers are a microtransaction, but I guess you know those won't ever happen, same with race changes and name changes, etc.
---
Ignorance is just the sweetest thing we have left on this planet, thank you for that.
---
They’re saying mobs dying quicker via cat form = less damage overall.
---
lmao I was expecting some in depth thread about leeway, but its just the same dude posting the same single clip as evidence, with people pointing out the same issues such as the possibility of either player lagging LOL
---
I’ve gotten close to 60 in about 7 days on pservers (that’s obviously not accurate experience) but I got the routes down pretty good and I have proper gameplay experience so it’ll be much quicker than vanilla
---
This is because their gear is trash. Once the power level of the players increases, rushing strategies will probably become much more viable.
---
*fortunate son plays in background*
---
But it has been proven that maul does more damage than cat form at lv 20. Infact bear is better in every way except movement speed until lv 24 ish.
---
Good to see people reporting bugs and then being fixed
---
thanks man :)
---
No, you're just the one who contextually doesn't understand why he would say what he did. Keep ignoring what the entire conversation is about because there is a few too many swear words for you.
---
But bear kills them faster than cat at lv 20.
---
You can transfer once every 6 months on classic, stop acting like i’m some dumbass kid when in reality WoW even nowadays barely has any significant microtransactions.
---
LFG and LFR were the beginning of the end IMO. Crossrealm BGs only helped with queue times
---
What’s west of kalimdor?
---
&gt;Crossrealm Battlegrounds were the Beginning of the End
---
Maybe people feel that way because the video game industry has been increasingly fucking over the people who are giving them money.
---
Kargoz who made it actually just duo levelled through durotar as double rouge with Navak (first person to hit 30 on beta) and they posted their faster 1-10 time. 
---
At early levels double rogues just trade backstabs and aggro and fly through mobs
---
Yeah okay I know, but I'm talking about the movement itself. Now it literally just teleports you 20 yards forward. Supposedly back then it wasn't a teleport, it was a jump forward, with the same effect, except you could jump over a small ravine, etc.
---
No they don't. They never have. Wrong values. Wrong equations. Wrong Boss fights. Every single time Blizzard compares to their 1.12 client Pservers have had it wrong. And thats just the stuff they've gone out of their way to show us.
---
It does both and boosts your armor.
---
To be fair, these are level 58s with trash gear doing them. I imagine they'll speed up significantly with max levels in actual gear.
---
Both
---
Old school evoc was great.
---
You would 100% get banned if you tried to clear raid content with a bug like this.
---
XD
---
I’m not disagreeing, just explaining their post.
---
That'd be great, Only add my ideas if you think they're good enough haha, I have a strange feeling you know a lot more about this than me.
---
Maybe you could explain what leeway-melee is, if you want people to understand why you're concerned.. and Hunters at large.  That seems like a pretty critical piece of info.
---
It’s lvl 58 though. Lvl 60 with T1 will clear the NPC’s a lot faster
---
Well there goes all my hype.
---
They'd have mentioned it in the reasoning i assume
---
this is the Direwolf-like closure we needed.  Thank you OP!  Now name him Ghost :D
---
Fuck outta here with this conspiracy bullshit. Blizzard has an internal client. It's the same as it was then.
---
Is this just a visual bug or have the next stress test invites gone out already but you cant download it yet?
---
He killed them faster so they hit him less.
---
Theoretically having a dead zone between 8 and 11 yards compared to between 5 and 8 yards, means the dead zone surface area is considerably larger.
---
Tauren hit box affects both melee max range and ranged minimum range.
---
I'm unsure if melee leeway affects both as well. If not that would effectively shrink the dead zone even though the hunter would still be worse off than without the leeway. The melee attacker (having more/better melee skills/damage) gains more use out of the increased melee range than the hunter.
---
For real. I’m tired of this baby talk dog culture being everywhere. I can’t enjoy anything without people circle jerking about dogs.
---
Reason why I think they're doing this is that if they did use 1.7 they would need to use private server values since they don't have data from 1.7 (from what they've said), I think this is the biggest con, although I don't really care if they did use private server values for AV alone... better than having butchered AV
---
Sub 50-60 you'll be fine healing dungeons in a dps spec.
---
You'll notice it hardcore if your gear gets out leveled by the dungeons as well.
---
I think he means he's gunna work 70 hours after raid day till lockout to buy 3k gold. 
---
Cause that's the only way your making that much in classic in a week. Lol
---
Good luck to everyone doing this on day 1!
---
This makes me sick
---
but if you do that, you miss out on all of the greens from disenchanting dungeon drops and quest rewards that are soulbound and can't be mailed to your bank alt.
---
did this for our server first nef kill
---
All your edits aside, you’re still wrong.
---
I wish there was an add on that could tuck this somewhere and you could click it as you go through the dungeon
---
 Can't wait to play, really looking forward to August 27(
---
Yeah, I think the optimal classic would be one that blends the best parts of all the vanilla patches rather than purely 1.12, but that requires a lot more work on blizzards part.
---
This was filmed on Sylvanas EU which is housed in the French server cluster.  
---
Other users confirmed approx 100ms latency to Sylvanas EU from Sweden. Vurtne's latency bar is green. We can't tell what the other Rogue's latency was, but you can clearly see when other Rogue players are lagging in the video and it can be seen at several points early on.
---
My point, which I attempted to make in the other thread, is that we can't know their exact latency. It's fruitless to argue that players might have lagged because there is no way to verify. All we know for certain is that Vurtne wasn't lagging.
---
Why is this marked up as ‘humour’?
---
or undead rogue?))
---
Oh sorry
---
Back in the 90s nerds and jocks didnt mesh like they do now adays. If you liked video games you didnt like sports sort of mentality.
---
So a science teacher who coaches sports is an oxymoron cause its a contradicting yet he makes the conjunction between the two subjects.
---
Obviously.
---
Calm down mate, we don't know if this will be the case at launch.
---
I still place Aspect of the Cheetah as the single most important ability out of any class for leveling. If you were a hunter, and you only had a pet and Aspect of the Cheetah (no other spells), you would still level faster than any other class. Partly because of the way Hunters are designed, and also partly because of how overpowered Cheetah is for leveling.
---
It's cool, he doesn't play a shaman any more.  He rolled warrior.
---
There’s SO much content they can add after Naxx, they just have to make sure that gear power only increases incrementally so that power curve never gets too out of control. I really hope they chose to add content and not do TBC.
---
It averages to something like 5% speed increase. It's something but hardly a life changer.
---
Hmm, weird. Maybe this has to do with the fake spell batching Blizzard is trying to implement.
---
I was able to download it but the play button is greyed out and I can't click it. Maybe when the beta opens or the next stress test it, won't be like that anymore
---
29.5 is impossible if you do basic math, and this value should have never spread.
---
54 is the value from level 60 paladin in patch 2.0.
---
For a priest specifically it won’t be a big deal until later, the thing you will notice is how much more you’ll be drinking which can slow down the dungeon run a lot. Def do able though
---
But at lv 20 bear does more damage than cat. So that’s not the case unless he wasnt lv 20 in which case his input was irrelevant as we are discussing lv 20
---
Retail has tons of microtransactions, significance is preference. Let's hope there won't be, but you have no idea on their future plans, this whole classic thing was taboo 6 months ago.
---
In a perfect world, them just adding classic for the players would be great, but they're a business and all of the work they are putting in, they will have to profit somehow besides the _initial_ influx of subscriptions.
---
I was in one of them yesterday that went for 9 hours 4 mins, so it wasn't a full day but it was a pretty epically long AV.
---
I literally just dinged 20 and went to darnausus while it makes sense to get my portal only to realize it's the only one you dont get till 30
---
You can teleport all you want right as long as you have the runes for it? Like any CD on that like hearthstone?
---
yes. you get teleports at 20 to capital cities of the races that can be mages.
---
Other cities are "secondary" for a mage race therefore only at 30
---
all the people on our servers will be in a city getting their instant queue xrealm bgs, nobody left out in the world to pvp with
---
exactly, just because the content is known and easier now than it was back then doesnt mean it cant wipe you. 
---
Preferably more relaxed guilds will bring a ret pally, boomkin or shadow priest along but bring groups of them would just be a horrible experience for everyone.
---
Mostly following the same steps Old School Runescape took. Make entirely new content which follows the same spirit and philosophy of the original game, while maybe adding in some stuff that was released afterwards that fit in with that philosophy. All while the player base votes on options curated by the devs. For example the RuneScape devs polled on letting something called the “God wars dungeon” come into the game, which is content that was released after its “vanilla stage”, a wow equivalent  might be karazhan. The player base felt it was in line with the original game, both in spirit and in quality. Meanwhile new things have been added that were never added in the modern game, I’m hoping we can get something like a release of mount hyjal or some other fill in spots that were left empty when wow released.
---
No, you blink the direction you are facing.
---
If you say so
---
When I played just now, it looked totally the same to me as in your other screenshot - the normal blue tint. I have no idea why some streamers seem to have it more yellow. Just calm your horses, ok?
---
Never saw this one before...
---
Someone must not play mage, especially on pvp
---
For the above person's goal of "just dispose of greens" it works pretty well.
---
But as a healer who's planning to spend as much time as possible in dungeons, I'm strongly considering leveling with enchanting.
---
Idk either and when I’m not entertained on reddit I resort back to the hub again
---
That is pretty normal for most classes at lvl 20 though. If you train everything of course.
---
It's always good to see someone correct the record.
---
WoW's character customization is so limited I can remember the options I had for my orc back in the day.
---
We need another of your posts.  They’re so funny.
---
I was on Alex ally and definitely remember Onyx. I can’t remember a ton of names, but Sixis was a keen bean, shammy Ellana? There was a warlock and mage combo often farming mid, one Demonicus or something?  You had a warrior join your cartel late on as he was messing up your grind solo? We were in a casual guild &lt;Zeal&gt; and only a few of us were into PvP so the struggle was real.
---
Do BG post match screens not show dmg and healing done in classic/vanilla?
---
You spam lightning bolt and keep totems down. 
---
The problem is you oom 
---
I plan on being ele/resto for pvp/pve. And eventually just be shit ele dps once I get some gear. Same rotation as the other casters so meh.
---
I will never forgive blizzard for what they did to the tauren.
---
I don’t think you know what alarmist means.  By definition, being alarmist is a bad thing. 
---
Shouting from the hilltop about everything wrong in the beta is NOT helpful.  If layering is unchanged a month and a half from now, there is an issue, and feel free to start shouting. But it’s been in the beta for like 2 weeks.  They haven’t even had time to really fix it yet.  Calm down and be patient.
---
Gnome
---
I picked the same face in vanilla but my gnome beard covered up that smile in Vanilla. Imagine my surprise when the first barbershop came out and I discovered I had been playing an 85 year old sex offender the entire time. Needless to say the beard stayed.
---
I've never been back to the barbershop.
---
&gt; Theoretically having a dead zone between 8 and 11 yards compared to between 5 and 8 yards, means the dead zone surface area is considerably larger
---
I’m not saying 5-8 equals 5-11, I’m saying the **actual** deadzone was 5-11, not 5-8, because it takes into account combat reach, which adds 1.5m to each player.
---
You're better at other things, I can't make a map and I have no creativity to imagine how the zones/instances would look like.
---
You can heal just fine as a dps spec pre-60. During Vanilla I leveled my priest as shadow and healed fine.

Yes, it was changed in TBC. Vanilla you can DE anything with low skill.
---
A friend was at my house and downloaded it on my computer via his account. I just uninstalled it to see if the install button would appear and instead the entire thing dissipated from my account, lol. Clearly it was just a bug, at least for me
---
Travel form is 30
---
A lot of classes and talents were buffed sometime between 1.1 and 1.12, so the mobs in Classic are indirectly easier than they were in earlier patches.
---
Also, private servers buffed dungeons and raids, so it's easier on Classic than private servers.
---
Missing a comma there.
---
Based and huntard pilled.
---
That wouldn't fix anything since you cap those other objectives (towers, leiuts, captains) for the bonus honor on a zerg rush anyway.
---
&gt;Rogue isn’t even the best example for this.
---
Nah dagger rogues, if combat specced especially, didnt exactly perform bad, just didnt reach the dmg numbers quite that swords did.
---
A better example would be shadowpriests, i remember our guild masters didnt allow one to join the main raid until he was really geared out and even then you could always feel that they disgrunted him when he underperformed in fights etc.
---
He’s saying cat was doing more damage. Maybe he’s playing bear wrong, but that’s what he’s claiming.
---
It's well known that private server dungeon mobs are buffed. 
---
You're speaking to normal world mobs, which hasn't really been a point of discussion.
---
I believe this means you are invited to the atress test unless I'm wrong.
---
Does anyone watch these? Never clicked on one but literally have no desire to lol
---
Haha. Yeah did well for me. My mate dropped out of uni because he played too much wow. And it all started with a simple character transfer. 
---
No “regurts” over here tho. I got it back when I quit with some pretty good achievements lol.

lol there's like one fight in phase 1 and 2 where threat matters. Honestly half the shit you say is crazy person talk. But by all means plz dw tank mc &amp; bwl, just stream it so we can all be entertained.

Two against one. He loses.
---
Imagine instead of a jump it was more like being dragged forward. Anything on the ground would mess you up, and you couldn't use it to traverse gaps just like you said. It's a little finicky
---
And expensive
---
God my body is ready
---
Me and the gang are getting together for our first taste of Classic since we were too young to play the early expansions. I can’t wait to see this world that is new for us but old for so many others.
---
&gt; I've never seen that.
---
&gt;if you point out that ret paladins are awful DPS.
---
Part of the disconnect could be due to a lot of people having memories of the content pre-1.12, and the content would have been indirectly more difficult in those patches. 
---
Skill increases over 15 years is definitely a factor though.
---
Facts. Im sick to death of it already. I played this morning. Healer and Mage and Im just... freaking sick of it. Its made worse by the fact that you cant even give yourself a break by going and doing anything else. You are confined to the freaking city.

Cant even go farm mana pots or something.... Server is already empty, will be a ghost town by tomorrow

&gt; The original WoW developers decided that there would be an array to hold your inventory. The first several entries are things that end up on the paper doll, your head and leg slots and such. After that comes your inventory. At some point they wanted to add a bank to the game, so they added that to the end of the array. Players shouldn't be able to access their bank anywhere in the world, as it would break the code. This was handled by adding lots of statements in different places in the code, defining what the array position was where the inventory ended and where the bank begins. This value was hardcoded all over the place, but it isn't just a simple search to find them all. Some math logic may rely on it being constant. If you want to add slots to the backpack, who knows what you are going to break? It becomes very buggy and error prone, and likely that you are going to make a mistake. This mistake would break the game in a way you don't like. As a result, they would have to put amazing engineers that could be working on new features on a task to look through thousands of lines of code to find all of those cases, as well as the QA department testing every edge case in the world to ensure the change doesn't break anything. This is how we ended up with a fixed size backpack.

I joined a full SM run yesterday from a random w/. Was kinda surprised my Gnomer gear was on par with the SM drops for a Priest except for the GY wand which I had already replaced with Greater Magic Wand. Anyways, great fun.
---
That was nerfed in vanilla.
---
Odd you only have those two listed for pvp, I would play female nelf cause flips and figure, plus I love their animations more.
---
I'd do female dwarf though cause it's rude to get killed by that chunk of meat and humiliating.
---
Not at 20 though.  You only have prowl and claw I'm pretty sure.  Not until like 26-30 do you actually have a full suite of usable cat abilities.
---
&gt; Or maybe they wanted 1.7 AV that actually had all the content and challenges that made you have things to do other than beeline straight to Drek and Van
---
Literally no one is beelining Drek and Van. I was in a match that I afk'd out of after 4 hours earlier....
---
People are fighting. But it gets old. No matter what you do, a constant back and forth EVENTUALLY gets old after hours and hours. 1.5 nor 1.7 AV wouldnt make this mess any better.
---
Is blink still broken AF? I remember falling through the world so much. Even in front of Ironforge during a duel lol.
---
Sure that's not Searing Gorge?
---
He is probably not lv 20. 
---
I’ve speed leveled Druid to 60 3 times and you don’t even use cat till 25 because ur maul ranks do more damage and ur cat abilities do less. 
---
On top of the fact that you can shapeshift Into bear for an instant maul but for cat. You have to wait for energy ticks for it to be effective.
---
No cooldown on teleport if I remember correctly
---
Alliance players: “I play alliance because I like the alliance!”
---
Horde players: “I play the horde because I hate the alliance!”

60s cd
---
Talking out of combat here. It hardly compares to cat/travel/wolf form for example when traveling distances.
---
I think spells like blink and charge are the new versions so you no longer glitch (as much)
---
Holy shittttt go take a look at this guy's comment history. Wow. Just wow.
---
Have you considered the possibility that AV has a night and day cycle and that yellow is actually the sunset tinting the entire area?
---
This makes me happy.
---
He should have taken some initiative and hopped on ventrilo to talk to the qt3.14 NE Druid chick
---
I was thinking the same thing but how hard would it be to level too different classes like that?
---
pretty disappointing
---
I think it's one of those things that just adds to the charm of what Vanilla was. It wasn't amazingly polished with the animations.
---
It was *indeed* tacky, and that's a small part of the charm I do think should be restored.
---
Those of us in beta arent shitting on it because the matches arent long enough, nor because its not 1.5 AV....We are shitting on it because no matter what version, a bunch of players confined to a city, with shitty template gear capped at level 58 allowed to ONLY AV is fucking boring after a day tops.

Shadowmeld also gives you a passive buff to your stealth when you're in stealth even if you don't use the active.
---
Dwarf is far superior for daggers/pvp than nightelf imo, makes you almost unkillable rogue vs rogue.

Because it's not released yet.

Yeah Night Elf is perfectly fine for dagger rogues.

I did, uninstalled the game and it went away. LOL

Thank you for sharing.

We want to play moonkin and ret paladin or whatever, but thats not acceptable cus everyone has to optimize shit

Oh no...less people will want to play hunter?  game breaking...

You probably have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Azshara should be inspired by Greek mythology.
---
&gt; Notice the guy you're replying to also posted earlier in this thread claiming that during vanilla it would be a 40v40 grind in the middle "until resources ran out". He's a bullshitter who didn't even play back then.
---
Or he's just misremembering. It was 14 years ago; most people can't even accurately recall something that happened a week ago, let alone some trivial bullshit detail from their childhood.
---
Das ist nur zum richtigen deinstallieren gedacht vom letzten Stress Test .
---
This is probably on a private server. You can't make a character of the  opposite faction in classic, unless of course the dude had two beta accounts which is unlikely.
---
No changes ... seriously where would this even ever end. 1.19 would already be so far off from classic you'd have people asking for it back all over again for 1.12
---
Yeah ofc, but u didnt had this option available before, only if u got any access
---
Can you not read?
---
This is false. It only increases your stealth level by 1 (equal to 1 point in MoD) when using the active and standing still.

Adults understand not everyone has to share their opinions. They can also disagree without swearing for half of their attempts at a coherent thought. I understand fine his position, but getting that upset about an opinion is laughable and your attempts to a higher position are adorable. One day you too can be a big boy and understand this.
---
They are all just asmon watching 10seconds of a video, pausing, making up some bs neckbeard story, saying one of his 3 catchphrases "that's how it goes, you get got, I'm a literal god", resuming the video and repeating.
---
Go give the original video creator your views, not asmongold or his army of leaches on YouTube.
---
I totally agree but a small note - all races except tauren have the exact same hiybox and reach
---
This does not work in Classic. Only private servers. I've tested it
---
Now everyone is playing on high fps and low ping, rather than high ping and low fps. Also the fact that these days even LFR in retail has more challenging mechanics than vanilla raids
---
24h, wil be fine
---
There's a weekly thread in the sidebar for posts like these. Please follow the rules.
---
Oh, good :)
---
It's a little bit fiddly but you get the hang of it pretty quick. You can play two classes that synergise well. You probably level about 15% slower than a solo character but you get two lvl 60s... So it's like levelling an alt in 1 day played. It's going to be much faster than any method of getting to 60 with one and then trying to level another.
---
It is pre-patch aka 2.0.x. Look at the arena name. It is not classic it is as far as software versions are concerned The Burning Crusade without all the content unlocked.
---
AV is definitely something that without the rewards or rep from it just isnt fun. Doing that first one for an early Ice Barbed Spear or finally getting an Unstoppable Force made doing it a bit... easier. Going ona  premade with no skin in the game its just... bleh
---
It's not working for me at all really. FD doesn't drop me out of combat
---
What staff are you using?
---
If i'd want something changed i would have made it a single neutral town, maybe a town that is less fanatic part of the Scarlet Crusade, abandoned people from the Scarlet Crusade or a non-faction minded people. Kinda like what we meet in some of the Legion zones, the scottish people in western Val'sharah or the Pirate cove in Drustvar.
---
Nice. One cherrypicked clip. 
---
There have been plenty of other video examples that show the exact opposite (posted in the other threads)
---
But just ignore those and hope blizzard keeps a huge buff in for your melee class!
---
If Classic is even 1/3 as populr as Vanilla was, a lot of the time when I get a random invite it will be from bing-bong trying to sell gold. I absolutely never accepted random invites from people I didn't know.
---
why do you get an extra 1%?  Is the miss chance 8.6%?
---
if you haven't noticed blizzard has a real obsession with quests dealing with shit.  In burning crusade I think there is at least 5 quests where you have to get something out of a pile of actual shit.
---
Related - I thought your char had to be at least lv35 to max out enchanting.
---
You can on a PvE server
---
Maul costs 10 rage (with talents). The only way you'd be able to Maul right away after shapeshifting into bear is if you took 5/5 Furor, which is generally agreed to be suboptimal for levelling speed (since you lose out on getting Feline Swiftness as soon as possible).  
---
Additionally, energy regens out of combat while rage disappears out of combat, making Cat form infinitely more practical for levelling.
---
would non-faction minded people exist in lordaeron though? they were in the alliance
---
Because only raid loot is used in transmog lol
---
Ich bin blod. 
---
I got told that was the best chat up line on my first visit to Berlin. 
---
Why didn’t it work?
---
I'm glad there are other people who liked Crossrealm BGs and the sense of community they developed.
---
Makes me wish Blizzard would look for some kind of middle-ground. For instance, they could try making a small 2-3 server battle-group.
---
Remember to keep growl turned on for your pet, tanks will appreciate you helping out! 😂
---
Use aspect of the pack too, Cos everyone can move faster, and who doesn’t like that?
---
Use the cheapest ammo, to save your own gold!
---
Be the best huntard you can be! 😂
---
You can’t play classic yet
---
Does mele mages and warlocks always topping the metets
---
God, dude, the amount of "Welll, Akshaully..." in this sub right now is going to make me unsubscribe and wait for the 27th in solitude.
---
That's strange, must be a bug. Blizzard should definitely look into this.
---
I don’t know why but I’m always surprised when I see handsome guys on Twitch. If I looked like that I’d be off getting laid all the time.
---
The miss chance is 8%, but raid bosses ignore the first +1% hit you have, so it's effectively 9%.
---
In pandaria and legion too. Idk about bfa :d
---
Asking how much he sucks asmongold's dick was super adult-like! Thanks for the lesson!
---
Blink is also useful for avoiding fall damage! at certain distance to the ground you can use it and be teleported blink-distance to the ground without taking any falling damage.
---
This if you dont have or want to waste feathers for slowfall. :P
---
That's a turd!! A big, moldy, poop. Haven't they heard of buckets? 😆
---
You’re likely going to be invited the a stress test soon.
---
I mean, if we get post Naxx content, I could see an honor tweak / bg rework possible
---
That was the worst. It didn't even have to be an incline, just a gap between two texture layers was enough! If you were *really* luck you'd fall between them into a void and die.
---
Darnassus is based off Australia.
---
A million miles from anything!!!
---
The ending my heart hoped for ❤️
---
Yeah ofc, but u didnt even had the Option before if u didnt had the access to classic. Now the option is availabil, but u cant start it
---
I bet you’d like that, nerd.
---
Same deal for me. But think of it this way: That first week the servers will be FUCKED. No one will be able to get too far ahead on the working stiffs, but the week after it will be easier, and thats the 35 to 60 push time, which is WAY harder and longer. 
---
Least thats what I keep telling myself.
---
oh wow I didn't even think of recreating my original character. I still remember it was the Undead with a mohawk
