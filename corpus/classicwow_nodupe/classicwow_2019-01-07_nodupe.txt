You can on the private server I'm on. Not sure how it's suppose to work.
---
---
---
I mind the fucked up resolution, though.
---
...PI disc priest is actually what I am looking forward to play most in classic... 😞
---
Yeah sorry meant that as F to pay respects, i am prob of the few minotirty that didnt mind wild star.
---
I always believed that the only thing that could kill wow, would be wow itself. Now it seems like there's multiple ways that can happen.
---
If it didn't already kill itself I mean...
---
(How would I know, I don't play that shit anymore!)
---
They haven't said anything about how many servers they're opening yet. Some people are concerned they'll launch with a very small number of servers and that RP servers simply won't be prioritized (less than 10% of retail players play on RP realms as of time of writing)
---
Consecration isn't crucial to tanking early.  You can keep decent aggro with just retribution aura and tab targetting.  If the move speed is important to you, I'd recommend going full ret and doing a respec at 40.
---
Pets and mounts in a tab, rather than eating up limited bag space. However no account-wide sharing, each tab is character specific.
---
I will never understand healers who actually kill shit to make gold. 
---
Jesus, with the downvotes. Can we please not become a stereotype, /r/classicwow?
---
The answer is you go whatever spec your guild needs to pad meters and then you herb for gold. All you need to do is some mindless laps in Felwood/WS/EPL and you have more than you need for raiding. 
---
Ground control to Major Gronn 
---
Yeah. There will be one before release for sure but I’d guess about a month before, and we’re still months away from summer. 
---

---
Probably late spring or later would be my mildly educated guess. 
---
So, just a coincidence you took the guild name of a top 10 world guild in classic and TBC? 
---
I done some simple testing on pservers and on the classic test, I don't seem to ever get seal of command outperforming seal of righteousness? Even just seal of the crusader outperforms seal of command in my tests.
---
Any vid/math to show seal of command ttk being lower than sor/soc?
---
Im looking for exactly this, but on a RP realm.
---
&gt;But how ironic that that only one who really had the potential to topple it was wow all along :)
---
I think we might be getting a little ahead of ourselves here.
---
ZG isn't on the same reset schedule as MC and BWL, (neither is onyxia, but it still takes 40) so it's hard to lump it in with them. Still, even as a part of a *mildly* average guild, it's hard not to clear MC, BWL, and Onyxia in a single, 4 hour night, and that's *not* sperging out over speed clears. 
---
If you're part of a group that can't do this, then it's not a group worth being in, in the first place. So, yes.. I understand elitism just fine. This is why I have a hard time grasping why people try to speed clear those raids. They're brain-dead easy to begin with.
---
The guild has been around for a while. Dont think the forte guild your thinking of is related to us in any way. Its been under it's current leadership since cata. 
---
The sacrifice for the shield is the pets ability. The sacrifice for the buffs (succubus 15% shadow DMG increase) is a warlock ability.
---
I just think it's strange - the guild got a couple of world second kills after all. 
---
You know, if this was legion id would agree with you, and in fact during legion i was one of the guys making threads for the classic guys and the retails dudes to get along and that both games will be fun etc. Etc. 
---
Idk man i kinda want BFA  to kill retail wow just because i want to spite the choices blizzard has made in there own greedy hubris :(
---
I just realized I mistyped it. I meant piercing howl, not howl of terror. /facepalm
---
I mean for a good guild were your mages cam use PI without going over threat being a PI priest is basically mandatory. Going 31/20/0 is what most priests do especially when content is on farm
---
that background worgen is creepy. Top 10 pictures taken before disaster
---
Loot trading will be bad. But I'm more concerned with how the battlenet chat will affect faction interactions. 
---
If I had Holy Nova I could AoE farm DM:E for at least 20g/hr, mostly from vendor loot.
---
Without that, most of my gold comes from raiding.    
---
I don't (currently) have issues with mana or keeping people alive so I don't need to spend much on consumables.
---
I'm not a huge fan of doing something like herbing for gold. Especially on a server with such a high population. There's too much competition, 24/7.
---
I've slowly been leveling an alt that I'll be able to use for gold farming but I don't have that much time for WoW outside of raids.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I just took a quick snip of my screen rather than a screenshot lol 
---
Where was this taken? I don’t remember this area 
---
Yeah i wouldnt suggest any shadow talents till atleast ZG. That bloodvine suit is really helpful and by then a lot if caster have gotten there loot
---
Guys. That is going to be a big Yikes from me. Totally not Pog Champ or Dans Game. Literally doing the epic cringe face IRL right now.
---
I prefer this one (starting halfway in) 
---
https://youtu.be/8XVtDMipgFw?t=220
---
😃 Thank you for telling me what I want to hear! Now tell me I can be night elf instead of dwarf without getting passed up on raid progression content with fears...
---
Fuuuuck, i cant remember, we must have tried those though. Im going to put it as a tentative no but i wish you luck in finding a more concrete answer
---
Definitely give PvP servers a go in classic. I am largely a PvE player but played on a PvP server in Vanilla and LOVED it. In TBC I switched to PvE because it became a pointless shit show on PvP servers. Green geared level 70's were so, so much stronger than even the best geared 60's. The power gap was so massive that leveling players couldn't even fight back. Level 60's could be dropped by a few 45+ players, but level 70's just carved through anyone not in Outlands gear. Personally I think the power expanse is a large part of what made world PvP die, at least for me. It went from seeing a level 60 and a level 54 fighting, and you would jump in to help, to level 70's with dungeon blues almost one shot killing anyone who wasn't level 70.
---
Leveling on a high pop PvP server became such a chore, I levelled an alt on pve and that became my main. 
---
&gt;to each his own.
---
You say this but also
---
&gt;I smell a retail kid
---
Just move on then bud 
---
No
---
Where can I get this? 
---
Yeah you can, dwarf priest loses its shine after bwl and zg, dont get me wrong i know there is still one or 2 fear mechanics in AQ and BWL but id say that you are gonna have to accept that you might be warming the bench for a bit if not flat out denied because of player preception that dwarves and fearward are required when you only ever really need 2 of them for any fight in classic the other 3 priest slots can be whatever

People treating Activision like a separate company, and like Blizzard is the poor 'hard-done by' developer.
---
*sigh* 
---
Appreciate the supports, to my knowledge there is no rule against posting for guild recruitment. I'm sure the mods would contact me if I was breaking the rules. Thanks for the heads up either way. 
---
Duskwood. There's a mine full of worgen.
---
I think most of them are leaving because they're getting old and want to retire.

I just have to have the music on in game. Every zones music especially barrens and ashenvale is going to be chills when I enter the zone! Good luck on your playlist and have fun with the release!

I wonder how many times a day this thread appears. If we say 5 times to be conservative × roughly 400 days since anouncement, that is 2000 times.
---
Thanks everyone for your feedback!  We're just looking to expand our team!
---
I never play Tauren but when they were doing blog posts about the model revamps I thought ''eh the fingers look really really weird and the face is off'' and people even made posts about it and fixed the faces themselves and I thought well ok, they'll probably fix it or it will look better in action. 
---
It's really bad
---
Hehe
---
You wont down rank renew or prayer of healing (generally) 
---
you dont cast heal at all
---
That leaves you with maybe 3 different flash heals and 3~ different greater heals.
---
Yeah, it's originally based on Drake.
---
I do indeed! Going to crack it open tonight:). Enjoy your copy as well once you get it!
---
Agreed, he spared no expense. Really nice even the pages are nice. 
---
Or maybe they are getting tired of Activision?
---
I don't think it is a coincidence that Metzen left after WoD, considering that WoD was easily the worst expansion.
---
I don't think it is a coincidence that Morhaime left after Legion, considering that it somehow managed to be just as bad as WoD.
---
I don't think it is a coincidence that Brode left after Witchwood because, well, [Shudderwock....](https://kotaku.com/hearthstone-director-reveals-the-craziest-card-weve-eve-1825114809)
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I wouldn't be at all suprised to hear that Activision has been pushing Blizzard devs to make half-assed shit to maximize profits, and that's why so many old-timers have left in the last few years.

It's most likely only a small part of the player base that are particularly extreme about having "the vanilla experience". Most people just want to play it to experience content in WoW they never got to or haven't seen in a long time. It's not about redoing everything just like you did it back then. It's about doing the same things as you did back then, but you probably do it differently now. 
---
Why does your chat look like Trade /2 ?  Or are people in duskwood LFG for SM Cath and BRD?
---
I would love to see a WoW or other good MMO with graphics like that. Those videos look amazing. Appreciate the Grizzly Hills clip - never played past TBC, so it's the first time I've heard that incredible music.
---
Nice video :=)
---
Actually Metzen was stressed about Titan failing and helping to make Overwatch become a thing. He was also getting anxiety from presenting at Blizzcon.
---
And Legion was great, and not even close to WoD. 
---
its /world on pvt server
---
Well it’s good to know there are others like me out there. Hope to see you in classic, I’ll be the one torturing myself but lvling as a holy priest.
---
Chances are we grouped up for some UBRS at some point. Your warrior sounds familiar.  Unfortunately I mostly remember the names of guildies and people I couldn't stand. You didn't make that list! It has been alot of years after all. 
---
I'll be rolling a warlock this time around purely for ease of soloing/leveling. Maybe I'll remake Mannus, the benevolent paladin, after that. Haha.. "maybe." I know I will.
---
If we cross paths, I expect some legit dungeon farming!
---
It's not the worst build in the world, but I think the enhance talents are better spent elsewhere. There's a reason 30/0/21 is so popular.
---
Elemental and resto rely on similar types of gear (int/spellpower/spell crit/etc.) and if you want to do decent melee damage your gear has to be more focused on str/agi/hit/etc). The clash of stats makes elemental/enhance a tough sell.
---
Wow it looks so much better each post, thanks again for sharing!
---
I would also be anxious from presenting in Blizzcon if there was nothing of value to be presented, even tho I have a phone (Diablo Immortal -reference for anyone out of the loop).
---
Legion was great **compare** to WoD *at best*, but then again, so is literally anything else.
---
eat your [Filet of Redgill](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13930) and put your helmet ooon
---
I was thinking of going PVP server. But what i wanted to no is if i go to a pvp server. Will Classic have the option to disable pvp flag in game. Sometimes i might be farming and just want some dam piece of quiet other times i like to world pvp.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Will Classic have this option?
---
Seems cool. You lose out on some hit % by not going into the resto tree though. 
---
Come on, man. 2018 of Blizzcon wasnt the best, but its asinine to say that Blizzard has had nothing to show for the past years. It's one thing not to like current WoW, but Blizzard has pumped out plenty of games and content for Blizzcons in the past. 
---
U sound like a victim 
---
&gt; you’re far more likely to get Crit than to Crit,
---
No your not. Same level mobs have a 5% chance to crit you and paladins get 5% crit from ret talents alone so you should have somewhere around 10% crit while leveling...
---
You're right that Ret aura beats Sanc aura because of poor stat scaling early on (especially since I also agree that Cons rank1 + Sanc aura is a bit of a meme.) I'll update my post to indicate that you can put two points into Imp. Retribution aura instead of Sanctify + Two-handed Spec before respecing to Reckoning + SoC.
---
To your first point, you're absolutely correct that it's a bit of a wash.
---
Seal of Righteousness is very close to Seal of Command. The break point between the two is weapon speed. SoC does a bit more DPS with a weapon speed above 3.5 (Smight's Mighty Hammer, for example) than with SoR.
---
The reason I (and most Paladin leveling guides) recommend rushing SoC is because you're already rushing the Ret tree and if you can get Smight's Mighty Hammer from a Deadmines run you'll be a DPS machine until Verigan's Fist. SoC will continue being useful up to level 60 since you should be targeting slow two-handers throughout your leveling experience.
---
But, it's not that simple, as you've likely discovered! For example, Verigan's Fist is the best two-hander you'll use from level 20-30 and it's speed is sub 3.5, which means you're going to be using SoR for that entire time. This is just the wonkiness of Paladin leveling: you consistently need to pick up talents at just the right time when you're not going to need them for a while, lol.
---
A final note: Be careful with pserver numbers. Until very recently, most pservers had a bugged SotCrusader that didn't reduce the damage of each swing, making it the best Seal across the board. This has been fixed on [EDITED TO AVOID DELETION], but I'm not sure if it's been fixed on any other pservers.
---
With a properly functioning SotCrusader, it becomes the absolute worst Seal to have (you shouldn't even waste gold on purchasing it) because of a design oversight that caused SoR's Holy damage component to count as a second Weapon swing, effectively doubling SoR's attack speed with respect to procs. This wasn't fixed until 2.0.
---
I love the new gnomes :( though I get the complaints, they changed a lot
---
Thank you for watching!
---
You don't need consecration to tank early instances, blizzard designed them to be extra easy to most pulls are 2 mobs at max. 
---
Updated in definition, not updated in the way you're thinking
---
Yes
---
Yes.
---
Yeah dude, but as a hybrid spec you can totally take on multiple mobs, at least two.
---
Furthermore, you have to take into account the fact that Reckoning stacks and is never wasted, whereas Vengeance, the only real talent that relies on you Critting, more often than not activates right before a mob is going to die, wasting the talent entirely.
---
When I make the recommendation to respec at level 32 to include Reckoning it's because from a *holistic* leveling perspective it ends up being more effective and efficient overall compared to rushing Vengeance early on.
---
I didn't say "nothing" I said "nothing of value".
---
Sure they may pump out plenty of content, but as far as I am concerned: quality over quantity.
---
Oh and saying that Blizzcon 2018 "wasn't the best" is a gross understatement. The crowd booed. BOOED. IN BLIZZCON. Has this ever happened before? I'm genuinely curious.
---
If they added a single RP-PvP server, it would be full/locked for sure, so it's definitely not a population issue, since they don't have to add more unless it's needed.
---
Blizzards argument would 100% be something like "We don't wanna waste money on more GM's to enforce RP policy"
---
TBC and Wrath.
---
I would hope, for the future of classic wow, that everyone who has asked this question has to stand in a very small room together and discuss it until the end of time.
---
Yes it can, if you have 40 competent players optimally specd and using consumes. In fact it’s pretty easy... However, if you find yourself in a try hard guild you will be expected to min/max. If you are not in a try hard guild you won’t have 40 competent players and you will struggle to find 10-15.
---
TLDR: competent guilds who can easily crush 35 man MC with greens, will min max anyways and you will be expected to conform.
---
They booed at one panel at Diablo. Last I checked Diablo alone isnt all of Blizzard. Overwatch, Hearthstone, and WoW and Warcraft 3 all did great. As did StarCraft and HOTS (despite the crap that happened with esports)
---
Guild lacks a direct goal and are instead promoting an environment for pve, pvp, leveling,social and raiding. Will inevitably turn into a feeder guild or meme guild. To be clear, creating a competent guild for PVE or PVP takes complete and total effort from the guild
---
and it’s leadership, and even then, guilds often fail.
---
All of the best PVE guilds will be on PVP servers. PVP servers will have far better player retention and PVE content is the core foundation of gearing a player for PvP
---
Is WoW: Classic going to run off the existing WoW client currently available through Blizzard?
---
Downloading now in anticipation so I don't end up waiting longer come time :P
---
No.
---
found the sociopath
---
The genre was built on the backs of roleplayers.  The servers will exist.
---
The people here who tells you that Pala tanking can't be done or is going to result in a wipefest are wrong. It is certanly viable in every 5 man, though I wouldn't recommend it to new players.
---
The problem with it stems less from the inherrent issues there are with paladin tanking, and has more to do with the mindset/meta that has been established on private servers.
---
Many people are simply unable or willing to adapt their playstyle slightly when there's a paladin tanking.
---
Depending on the situation, you might clear the dungeon 15 minutes slower by taking a paladin tank, but that still beats potentially waiting around for an other 30+ minutes for a warrior.
---
If your group fails to clear an instance simply because there is a paladin tanking you are not failing because its a paladin, you are failing because your group doesn't know how to play.
---
Ah he plays the unlisted “ninja” class!
---
The fact that they booed at all shows that Blizzard is losing its integrity.
---
The other things you mentioned, they aren't bad. Neither are they great. New heroes/expansions are to be expected at Blizzcon. Nothing out of ordinary were announced, well except the WC3 thing (wait, wasn't there a 3rd party StarCraft 2 mod that was trying to do just that few years ago?).
---
I wish we had a single player Warcraft RPG. It’s honestly where the game should head next. It would sell like crazy since open world RPGs are all the rage
---
that'll get you kicked, lol
---
&gt;but the longevity of the game has to be brought up.
---
It's brought up just about [every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=OSRS&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).
---
I'm interested, why won't you be able to run it? Is it because you can't sit to gain stacks? Is there a source or anything you could give me that says it won't be a thing?
---
Miss the days when you had a name on a server and people knew you.  It helped keep some of the would-be assholes in check when someone stops getting invited to raids or groups because they are notorious for toxic behavior.
---
They are the best gold farmers.
---
I have some comments, but I mostly agree with everything said in this video.
---
basically, I'd say that it's okay to roll need on anything you will use, but if there's someone else in the group who needs something drastically more than you, then you should pass (for example, passing a ranged weapon to a hunter), I wouldn't kick someone for not doing this, but it's good etiquette
---
also, about chests, while the person who wins the roll gets the chest, if you really need something that was inside it, you should just ask for it, as usually people will be happy to share if you need it, and (I think) nothing in a chest is ever BoP
---
TBC was great. I know many wouldn't want flying mounts though. While Wrath had some neat elements it had too many things that would have to change. It was the first expansion were people didn't have to talk to each other. Dungeon finder and aoeing everything in dungeons are major culprits. I also didn't like the druid bear abilities in Wrath but that's a person opinion.
---
&gt; It's been more than 10 years since the merger.
---
People so badly want someone to blame, and blaming a company like Activision is pretty easy, so of course most people will go that route. I especially love the people who chime in on Reddit and other places and act like they have upper-tier insider knowledge of how both Blizzard and Activision are run, like /u/randomredditkid69xxx is some kind of expert on the subject.
---

---
Similar idea/spec in this video, and I would prefer his.
---
Notable issues with your spec are 5/5 Reverberation, 0/2 Improved Fire Totems, 0/3 Eye of the Storm, 0/2 Storm Reach, 4/5 Anticipation, 0/2 Improved Ghost Wolf, and 0/2 Guardian Totems. 5/5 Flurry is arguably bad as well, but since you're playing an unoptimal spec perhaps its part of the fun of it.
---
Reverb is 5 points for very little (if its for interrupt concerns, Guardian totems does this for cheaper). Imp. Fire Totems enables Fire Nova Totem (its going to almost always get killed if you don't get it). Eye of the Storm will decrease your casting time while Paladins, Warriors, Hunters, and pets are on you (rogues too but they have so many ways to stop casts its probably not going to do much). Storm Reach will make it much harder for hunters to run circles around you and get you in line with the other casters. Dodge chance will do very little, rogues likely will have you stunned/be behind you and warriors don't mind dodges because of Overpower. Improved Ghost Wolf will drastically increase your mobility, it still has a cast but becomes way less niche, you can run up and hope for your WF proc within Ghost Wolf and run away if you miss, also the PvP boots for Shaman buff Ghost Wolf's speed. Above utility of Ghost Wolf to run out quickly is why im hesitant to think Flurry is too great. Even with the crit to proc flurry with a 3.8 speed wep (MoM) you'll be sitting in melee range for 2.6 seconds. 
---
If I were to play this idea for a spec I would probably run something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVfzVfGqoVibzc
---
just beccause it's bad doesnt mean activision will wait for even a second to implement it if they think they can save on costs
---
Activision's pulling the strings at Blizzard, people who do work for Blizzard and have left recently have made statements have confirmed this. 
---
And should use every one.
---
My goal aa hunter this time around will ve to collect every single weapon possible to get.
---
Yes. Even Thunderfury.
---
Yeah unfortunately Activision's pulling the strings at Blizzard, people who currently work for Blizzard and have left recently have made statements confirming this. 
---
To be fair, the sentence remains true if you replace "vanilla wow" with pretty much anything.
---
Very true the ambiance was great.

&gt; Many people are simply unable or willing to adapt their playstyle slightly when there's a paladin tanking.
---
Which is why wasting your talent points to be an effective tank from 10-60 is a really bad thing to recommend to players who have never leveled a Protadin in Vanilla / pservers before.
---
&gt; Depending on the situation, you might clear the dungeon 15 minutes slower by taking a paladin tank, but that still beats potentially waiting around for an other 30+ minutes for a warrior.
---
This is... really not true. A Protadin has to sit to drink after every pull. Players might not realize it, but this adds *waaaay* more time to a dungeon than fifteen minutes. Also, this scenario presumes zero wipes because the party is 100% competent when it comes to supporting a Paladin tank.
---
As soon as 1 wipe occurs, you've blown up the time / efficiency of a dungeon. Running back, clearing entrances to the Dungeon again, getting back to the actual wipe area (including, but not limited to, killing Patrol packs that have respawn-flags)—all this pushes the timing way past fifteen minutes.
---
Once again, these things can and will happen with Warriors and Druid tanks too, but they're far more likely to happen with a Paladin tanking for PuGs.
---
&gt; If your group fails to clear an instance simply because there is a paladin tanking you are not failing because its a paladin, you are failing because your group doesn't know how to play.
---
And most players aren't going to know how to play when Classic launches. It's going to be frustrating enough with bad Warriors and Druids, but at least their tanking effectiveness depend almost entirely on their personal skill-level.
---
Paladin tanking, on the other hand, depends about 50% on the Paladin and 50% on the party.
---
I'm guessing this was a Horde quest?
---
I prefer going 19/11/21 yes
---
2 points in inner fire.
---
The extra armor especially early on is nice when hunters and rogues are op( pre bwl)
---
Combine that with some other armor items
---
( i choose the dodge and armor thrinket during ony attunement over the 2 spell crit on)
---
Arathi basin rep gear is armor heavy too
---
I think having all kinds of servers would be really interesting.
---
Classic dedicated, TBC dedicated etc.
---
Timeline servers (starts from classic, progress to current)
---
And then osrs style. Community based content starting from Classic.
---
Or, you could look at it as your kid and spouse being important to you, their stuff being important to them and nobody has to judge anyone else for their choices.
---
Think I should expand on this a bit more. We are PvE based, the open wording is just used to not scare away any players who have fears of the exclusivity of the top end PvE environment. The leadership we have is well aware of what is needed to maintain a guild and have done it before. I appreciate the comments and that is the thoughts behind it. 
---
I really hope they do. The best servers I ever played on were RP PVP, and I never RP'd.
---
OP shanked me in a dennies resturant once like ten years ago +rep
---
Thank you for the advice. I had tried to stream to YouTube via Restream, however for whatever reason it was not able to do it. 
---
I will look into this further :) 
---
Hold on to it but seriously get a modern mouse.  They have higher refresh rate, adjustable dpi, and generally lower optical error rate.
---
WOTLK soundtrack.
---
No way mop was better than TBC or WOTLK.
---
But it is 3rd place hands down flowed by legion
---
I just wanted to take a moment to say, the production value of your videos is far above what I expected.
---
You have probably the most clear and pleasant voice I’ve heard so far from wow classic content and in fact YouTube in general .
---
I look forward to seeing more and hope you put out more content .
---
It's all about the gear with shaman. You slap windfury on a might of menethil and it don't matter what your spec is.
---
Just from the otherwise ambiguous title, one can predict it's another OSRS/horizontal expansion post.
---
Oh shoot! I didn't realize it had released already! I might have to try to order a copy when I'm able. Would you say it's worth the $50?
---
What are some good ones that we can play on console that would somewhat resemble WoW?
---
I realized that before seeing this comment, but my first thought was current day dead mines with that warg boss.. like why is that on here 😂
---
I think we can at least agree on the fact that you at least CAN tank fine as a paladin, albeit it can be more of a hassle than bringing a warrior.
---
Where we might disagree is the in details, which I personally think you have blown a bit out of proportion. My experience tanking is certanly very different from yours, but I guess everyone will have slightly different experiences in an mmo.
---
Well, kingdoms of amalur was a valiant attempt. Not too hard to play, fun world, cool music. There was supposed to be an MMO but...well google it and you’ll find out what happened. 
---
It’s best on PC but can be enjoyed on consoles too
---
I can understand how that's faster than pressing the print screen button.

Do the percentages for each level and total completion mean the amount of xp/time to go. Or the percentage of steps left?

---
That’s an archived link to a Bluepost from 2006 indicating that they fixed the /sit macro bug to not generate Reckoning stacks. I believe this was fixed in patch 1.9, so it 100% will not be in 1.12. 
---
The reason you can do it on pservers is because pservers are a complete mess and absutely not as accurate as people seem to believe they are. 
---
For example, it wasn’t until recently that Consecration still scaled with *Strength*, and not Spell Power. There are countless known bugs or “guestimations” on pservers. 
---
That's extremely nice of you to say. Thank you. Made my night!   
---
One of my New Year resolutions was to pick up Adobe After Effects and become proficient with it. I've got a very basic understanding of it at the moment but it's nice to see my effort pay off little by little.  
---
I'm definitely going to continue putting out at least one video a week pertaining to Classic WoW (potentially more if I have the time/breaking news occurs).   
---
Thank you again for the kind words and also for taking the time to watch the video and leave some feedback! 
---
The classic team is already small. I doubt they'd allocate more resources to the classic team to create any new content when there's more money to be made with the cash shop in retail. 
---
Me too thanks
---
I like classic but I'm way more interested in tbc. Only time will tell I guess 
---
still plenty of quests like this, but fuck le retail amiriteee :--DDD
---
the demo playable during blizzcon pushed a separate client in advance of the server open.  
---
i would expect to be able to download the client thru the battle net launcher in advance of the actual game release.
---
Sure, and like I try to point out in my posts on this thread: 
---
I’m 100% behind the recommendation that leveling a Protadin with a consistent guild group can even be *more* efficient than the other tanks—but that’s a situation that will be very rare for most players PuGing their way theough Classic this summer. 
---
I also take into account the entire leveling process, where AoE grinding is going to be near impossible at launch with most mobs in most zones being heavily contested. 
---
But yes, with a solid party of great players a Protadin can 100% tank any dungeon in the game. 
---
Those days will be back soon (hopefullly). Servers shouldn't be more than 3k people, and usually they're divided pretty evenly between Alliance/Horde. So you're looking at around 1.5k people you'll potentially be interacting with. That's not a very large pool of people all things considered, so you can bet your ass people will know who to stay away from rather quickly.   
---
Also, with outlets like Discord, there will probably be server-wide "shitlists" posted publicly making it even harder on those who go out of there way to make it a bad experience for the rest of us.
---
General consensus is they're amazing at first and slowly fall off as the tiers progress. But even at Naxx they're still decent. Play what you want my dude. 
---
Doh
---
Ideally, it would mimic the original layout.
---
I think we have reasonably come to the conclusion that 6-7 is ideal.
---
1: Mc/Ony
---
2: Diremaul / World Bosses
---
3: BWL / PvP
---
4: ZG
---
5: AQ / Green Dragons
---
6: the same as what blizz have suggested - Naxx
---
I’m on mobile so I can’t check everything but there are other things like whether all BG’s are at the same time, when the DMF comes, etc that need to get slotted in, but I think we all agree that 4 is not enough.
---
Yeah, private servers are not a valid source. And thanks for the link.
---
I got my copy a few days ago. I am enjoying the read. 
---
Every class is good and the one you enjoy the most is the best.
---
Can I get a decent gaming laptop to play classic for under 1000 CDN (750 USD)?
---
Can anyone point me in the right direction?
---
What if the game got the same content patches as it did back then - but better paced - up to Fall of the Lich King, then it resets back to Vanilla and wipes everyone's characters so we can start over fresh?
---
Got my copy a couple days ago!! Dat special OG backer edition ftw!!
---
So crazy how it was the most successful nonfiction kickstarter of all time! Give us what we want Blizz!
---
But if you wanted to deposit some funds into my PayPal account, I'm sure we could come to some sort of an agreement. ;) 
---
Yep just shows the demand is there... glad this came out before classic release so that we have more perspective!
---
Content I have not read enough yet, but quality of the book wise absolutely it is. It’s not a cheap print.
---
no. 
---
&gt;I don't think it is a coincidence that Morhaime left after Legion, considering that it somehow managed to be just as bad as WoD.
---
Legion wasn't perfect, but this is laughably false, it wasn't close to as bad as WoD, and overall is considered one of the good xpacs.
---
10/10 troll. Doin god's work.
---
Level 10, a respawning Murlock forced me to run. burpees
---
Group of 3 protecting the body, had to run again after killing one. sit ups
---
Died and had to run once completing the level 10 warrior quest. push ups and a meal
---
Died to a rarespawn in a mine. Sit-ups burpees
---
&gt;If Blizzard doesn't hold a beta
---
They will, pretty much everything you said after this is pointless.
---
Yes if the beta goes like BFA; tons of bugs issues identified, and nothing done then sure, let's get worried.  If the beta is in the same shape as the demo, again let's get worried, but until then, let's drop the ultimatums.
---
One community I was with did that (WoW-RA, Roleplayer Association), since the game didn't launch with RP-PvP servers. We had several guilds on both factions on Bleeding Hollow. RP community on both sides died out by the time official RP-PvP servers came online. At least I know it was on it's last leg on the Alliance side, the Horde side of the community started out even smaller than us.
---
Unfortunately a RP community can be difficult to maintain, so any help, like having an official server, may be needed. 
---
I can't wait for good quest text again.
---
Except maces. And wands/shields for obvious reasons.
---
Not like it'll stop huntards from rolling on them though.
---
It’s a beautiful book I hope you enjoy reading jt
---
There’s great fishing around there 
---
I think your being a little over dramatic. Software developers are already doing it?
---
It’s already been done. a lot. Not just in wow but other games
---
Jesus Christ. 
---
Or you could say “you’re a reasonable adult, and I want to play this game for a few hours a week. It’s important to me. Let’s figure it out.”
---
If you don’t have the kind or relationship where that is possible, you have bigger problems than time for wow. 
---
I played DAoC when WoW was released. I was upset so many people were playing such a carebear game and DAoC was dying. I have tried to go back to DAoC on private servers and couldn’t recapture feeling. However, WoW private servers were successful on bringing the good times back.
---
Doubtful as the company that handled TGC stopped working with blizzard 
---
My dad works there too! Did he share the secret handshake?
---
I think greed is going to get the best of them and eventually the hardcore people will return to private/non profit servers 
---
Remove loot trading
---
No seriously retail blows though 
---
my turn to post this comment tomorrow 
---
Lol fake, worgens were released in cataclysm xDDDD
---
This is a screenshot from a private server. 
---
Very good content for a new player to the vanilla experience.
---
The only suggestion I have is that in content like this which is designed for very very new players it is helpful to use the default UI in game, so that their experience is a spot on match to what you are showing on screen.  For example:  the section about etiquette on rolling - your need/greed/pass panel is visually different than what a new player will see.  Now a player somewhat familiar with the game will easily know you've got an addon that changes its appearance and pick out the need/green/pass buttons easily, but a brand new player may not immediately recognize why yours is different, if there's a functional difference between what you are showing and what's appearing on their screen, etc.
---
Overall though it's a great introduction to a topic that's not given enough attention to. 
---
It transformed into a crappy WoW clone.
---
Go for PoJ, then Consecrate, then straight back over to ret for leveling if you want to tank some during leveling. You dont need the improved BoW.
---
RP-PVP servers are the best servers.
---
The people who populate them know how to speak and type coherently and also aren't afraid to mix it up and fight.
---
I'm hopeful some of the old guard from Ravenholdt and Emerald Dream find their way to classic.
---
Ideally for me, 18-24 months after the release there will be TBC servers introduced and you will have the option to transfer a clone of your classic character to that server and keep your classic character in the classic server. That would be what I would want, followed by Wrath. After Wrath i don't care haha. 
---
Give melee arcane int too! Helps with weapon skills. =D
---
Haha, I remember this one I think, from way back!
---
"Your reward? Rub my belly! Go on, RUB IT!"
---
Oh right lol. But why tits
---
&gt;they are lumping classic wow in with the current
---
There is no "lumping in.
---
Since 2004 if you want to play wow, you pay $15 / mo. Next year... if you want to play wow, you pay $15 / mo.
---
Yep... I think the funny thing is that if we go down that route, a lot of us who want no changes to Vanilla would probably love to see some changes to TBC and WotLK.
---
I'm guessing servers will be something like 4:2:1:1 PvP, PvE, RP-PvP and RP 
---
I don't think the improved wisdom would be necessary. It may help though. Personally i would just level full ret all the way down and maybe put points in holy or prot after getting repentance. Repentance will help tanking because it locks down one mob so you can pull with that. Then you judge one, auto attack another, and then possibly stun a 3rd. If you have a mage you can sheep one. Or a priest can shackle undead. Lots of options. You don't need consecration. Actually consecration can break sheep and shackle so you have to be careful with it anyway. Ret aura will also give you threat. Obviously righteous fury will be up at all times. If you ever find yourself not maintaining threat first thing you want to do is make sure you have righteous fury. :) also when you are pulling you will probably want to judge or cc the caster bc it is harder to keep aggro on them since ret aura isn't triggering for them. You can also tank with a two hander for more aggro if you have a good enough healer who does not mind. But you always want to keep a sword and board just in case they refuse to heal you with a two hander.
---
Alright since you want to play devils advocate, they are lumping it in. BFA is not Classic. Nobody knew if it was going to be it's own product with it's own price or not. Now we know that they are lumping it in. I didn't say it was being raised, i said they are keeping classic alongside current server $15 a month. 
---
its the same subscription even though there are no plans for content updates like there is for retail, kind of a cash grab not to offer a reduced fee for classic only but its only $15. since all of that 15 only goes to servers and the initial development there is no excuse for them to cheap out on the server infrastructure.
---
What was it like playing on rp pvp servers? I'm also thinking of rolling on said servers but I'm not interested in scripted roleplaying events and such
---
what I'm mainly looking for is themed guilds (assassin guilds, mercenary guilds, merchant guilds,... there was also a post on the front page a few days ago about a hinterlands guild with uniforms, a guild hall and chat restrictions etc which I thought was pretty cool)
---
and big *strategic* open world pvp raids
---
can I find that on rp pvp servers?
---
I was thinking more along the lines of how they are going to go back up in subscribers and start releasing subscriber numbers so they can show people "hey wow isn't dying" despite more than likely most of it coming from classic players. 
---
Be fair
---
Oof man. Many things in WoW deteriorated but music ain t one.
---
How many non-subscribers are expected to return?   
---
What I don't get is why his twinking is so half-assed.
---
If you're gotta grief people with your low level twink, why not get all green items, Crusader, etc? He doesn't even have a green weapon...
---
&gt; "hey wow isn't dying" despite more than likely most of it coming from classic players.
---
If millions end up coming back for classic, is it really dying?
---
Level 12 and don't feel like exercising more tonight so I'm gonna watch a movie or something and go to bed. Good times, I didn't realize how often I died playing WoW before now, feels good though, the rules aren't too punishing or too easy. Anyways, I'm gonna keep going tomorrow and I hope some of you join me!
---
Could have been! As I recall MYTH split not long into TBC. 
---
"Personally, I really hope they go with the OSRS approach, and only put in content that the majority of the playerbase will enjoy, while still remaining true to the heart and soul of Vanilla WoW."
---
Personally, I really hope people stop worrying about a sequel six+ months before the game is even launched. This blows my mind. We waited this long to finally get a Classic WoW server and all some of you can do is say "okay thanks for Classic but when are you going to start adding things that weren't there to fuck it all up again?"
---
This sentiment needs to die. We got Classic. Stop asking what happens next.
---
holy shit you know i mean modern wow, why the fuck do i have to spell everything out for you so i don't have to debate you?
---
The devs already said they have the tools to see what percentage of people are playing which and what percent of time they spend on each, so if they publish those stats saying look retail is alive and well they will know if its a lie or not.
---
I could never imagine going back to a pve server. Pvp is what makes the game, especially giant scale world pvp. 
---
On the forums you can see plenty of people who are only subbing for classic wow, current subs who are letting their subscription run out until classic, and even on reddit people who are not subbed but subbing for classic wow when it comes out. 
---
Wow, that's clever!
---
The idea that you should fight the interface to play the game has always struck me as one of the stupidest things ever in game design. Unless that interface IS the game in some way, like Guitar Hero, it should be as intuitive and easy as possible. WoW's idea of being flexible and customized to a user's needs, despite the base UI being terrible imo, was brilliance. 
---
Clever. Sure, but 2 otherthings go into it.
---
1.dont have to consume since im gonna die.  (Loatheb is about 30g-50g per pull per person in consumes lol)
---
2. I pay after the fight cause my gear is definitely red. Which means hearthing to the chapel and walking back. But that also means i could go and restock on stuff from my mailbox and skip having to do some trash
---
Repost. Since it got auto deleted cause i used a certain server name unintentionally lmao
---
God this sub is shitposty garbage 
---
There is no need for a beta. Just like vanilla bugs will be fixed when they are found. 
---
Stop looking for a conspiracy. Go ask the devs your self, they've straight up said they're retiring after long and very fulfilling careers, jfc this sub 
---
half year leveling are you drunk?
---
Exactly. But you'll never win against the shitposty circlejerk in this sub and /r/wow, they're fucking awful now. Sad because the latter at least used to be pretty good 
---
They didn't. Jeff and the team are still doing a great job 
---
Most posts here are.
---
Literally nothing. /r/wow and this sub have devolved to shitposty garbage 
---
When you paid $15/mo in 2004 you were paying for the development of new content, balance, future expansions, server costs and advancements to their game engine. In 2019 you're paying for initial technical development they're going through right now and server costs. After that, blizzards "cut" of those $15 is laughably greedy. You could also argue that server costs are cheaper due to access to better hardware. 
---
&gt;Classic is being brought back due to the recent failings of their more modern games.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Classic WoW, SC Remastered, Warcraft Remastered, etc are all a direct result of the reality behind this meme.
---
Lmao this is the biggest grasping for straws ive ever seen 
---
Some of those I agree with. But I'm pretty sure I paid for The Burning Crusade for the development of The Burning Crusade.
---
Fucking thank you. This sub and /r/wow is screaming downhill in terms of content, you'll never win against the shitposty circlejerk in this sub and [/r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow), they're fucking awful now. Sad because the latter at least used to be pretty good. But many other big subs have sadly gone the same exact route, shitposts and armchair devs and ceos everywhere :( 
---
Yes, just make a character profile that uses the orcs data. The other races are coming soon.
---
In 2004 minimum wage where I live was $8.50/hr

In 2018 minimum wage where I live is $15/hr

5:00 Nah, jump in on mining. Three or four people could potentially get +1 skill off a single node, +1 is max if you mine alone.
---
Every guild I’ve been has paladin tanks through bwl, so yeah 
---
The percentage fill on the level bar is an exact representation of my XP bar in-game while routing. The fill and percent on the progress bar reflects how many map blocks you've completed out of all the available ones. There's close to 600 map blocks for both routes so it doesn't move alot with each step.
---
Pretty sure u just have to use it right after mainhand, offhand doesn't matter. Atleast from what i know :)
---
I have no clue exactly which extra swings proc a reset of the auto attack timer and which don't, but we'll assume every one of them does for the sake of the argument (Windfury, Sword spec proc, Hand of Justice). You only need to worry about your MH swing and you want to use abilities like SS/Backstab right after your swing.
---
This is because extra hits from procs will reset your MH swing timer (and maybe OH, but who cares about that). You want to hit right after the swing so there's as little increased delay from the swing timer resetting if you get a proc off Sinister Strike. Having a 0.2s slower swing is better than having your swing timer be reset right as you're about to hit.
---
Just use Abar since the other addon seems to be utter garbage and is straight up unable to understand the difference between MH and OH.
---
Proccing sword specialization, hand of justice, etc, extra swing resets your main hand weapon timer regardless of what swing triggered it. So using abilities like sinister strike immediately after a main hand swing slightly improves DPS by minimizing wasted swing time.
---
Sinister strike doesn't reset the swing timer.
---
Great. It doesn't really matter whether you're planning on rushing through or take a more healthy approach, I can pretty much guarantee that you'll have way more fun by not getting constantly lost.
---
The questing in Westfall is objectively bad. It may be cozy and have some nice lore, but the quests are super grindy, super repetitive, spread out as all hell, and some are just a pain in the ass on top of all that.
---
On the other hand, Darkshore is a very convenient zone to quest in -- other than getting there. You can just go to Auberdine, pick up all the quests, run in a circle around the zone to complete them all, rinse and repeat for four or five levels. In terms of raw efficiency it is far better than Westfall.
---
Look for a guild that suits your needs.
---
Friends and I are creating a social raiding guild for example that clearly priorizes family and social life. That's why we intentionally want older people in our guild so everybody understands it if you just have no time or need to log off during a raid.
---
I am sure there will be plenty guilds with that goal and intentions.
---
And dont let yourself miss this opportunity just because you think there is no time. Even if you only can play the game for a couple hours a week or month but you enjoy it, everything is fine. You only need to set your own goals and dont compare yourself with the people with more time.
---
You ever try shield spike/consecration and only killing groups of lower level mobs? Killing Westfall gnolls at level 23-24 sounds like a good time.
---
I just really want TBC, i played every single day of that expansion, and didnt play too much on either end of it, so TBC was my thing, just wanna go back there, Draenei for life.
---
While this could be a fair point you should be using inflation as a measurement and not minimum wage. 
---
$15 dollars in 2004 is worth $20.41 today. 
---
So we could theoretically say they've cut off $5 off the subscription fee.
---
Guy gets all the points for the editing.
---
Overall pretty solid advice.
---
My only thing I saw was when you were mentioning what buffs you can give people as they run by to help them out, was when you included the shamans healing totem. 
---
Hi, /u/senorpapel
---
That's the point. I wish they'd show them individually but it's whatever. We all know what will be causing the majority of subs.
---
It's not even the same game. It's a completely different game at this point. It's different client, it's different server. They migrated database, so the only old bugs would be with database. Other than that, we will have a plethora of new exciting 2019 year bugs :)
---
This build is really not good. With that much in elemental you don't wanna make melee a competing priority, and you're better off going full caster gear and focusing on elemental. Also improved ghost wolf is infinitely better than 2% more Dodge.
---
If you wanna hit people in melee as elemental get a hand of Edward the odd for some instant cast lightning bolts and hearthstone shenanigans 
---
Except this is an MMORPG centered around two factions and therefore you can´t remove one of them.
---
Faction conflict is just a huge pile of shit (especially with the way it is portrayed in BfA, rest of the story is pretty good, but this just sucks) and should have been left at Vanilla level, where factions were at peace and even working together, but there were portions of both factions which were hostile to the other.
---
I just want to say I’m glad Nostalrius gets to have the legacy of being the martyr for classic. F to the server and my toons.
---
Read: That means some of the best PvP gear too. Pretty much everyone will engage with PvE.
---
Are you new to the world? People still pay an $8 toll to cross the Golden gate bridge, even though the tolls paid off the bridge decades ago.
---
Well I find it to be regional. Where I live things have changed much more drastically than other places, but yeah generally speaking, $15 is cheaper now than it was then.
---
Without trying to futilely guess at the number of servers, I would recommend you put your alts on one server. Being able to support your alts with your main’s money, professions, and friends is what will make them viable alts and not as large of a slog as levelling your main was.
---
I 100% agree. 
---
Absolutely dude. These guides are sorely needed as most of the ones from the original days are not up to today’s standards for videomaking.
---
Hunting for the rare pets was one of the best things about being a vanilla hunter. I still remember doing out in the barrens with my NE hunter looking for talk the leaper. 
---
Currently there are buffs on retail and you can buff people. The game is just too easy, with or without buffs, so nobody really cares about it. But I definitely saw people buffing me sometimes and I do buff warriors around me with that precious intellect.
---
You’re a redditor. Can you give your toon name so you can go on the kill list?
---
You only need to keep track of main-hand timer. Try to use your abilities right after main-hand swings, to maximize the benefit of extra attacks. Off-hand swings still proc extra attacks on your main-hand, but thats out of your control.
---
They are one of the more difficult classes to play properly.
---
They are amazing levelers and while its easy to level, the true skill comes to play at in PvP and PvE. 
---
They aren't the top performers in raids, but they are needed for their kiting, trueshot aura and tranquilizing shot. They can also quite good dps when played properly.
---
In PvP they are very powerful, especially in 1v1.
---
Holy fuck. Every day and the game isn't even released.
---
https://puu.sh/CsStN/f58df650c2.png That was added in 4.2.
---
Doesn't stop people from looting trading with their friends for gearing up but stops them from putting on the Auction house. Saying that was never implemented is incorrect.
---
Afaik, those guys (dark runner, tainted one, shadowweaver and one more) has always been in the game. 
---
It’s a standard upgrade over WW axe though. It’s good enough to get your big 2h axe crits on mobs, which is what you need levelling arms.
---
OG naga is the best mmo mouse imo
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you everyone! Got some interesting discussion past the letter of my question, good read! Anything to pass time untill Classic launches, hehe
---
Very thorough answer, thank you!
---
Reason to roll alliance spotted!
---
And that's why pools have chlorine. Someone peeing in the pool is gross maybe, but another half hour later and who cares? Man this is getting abstract.
---
3% crit on 4 mages will not make up for the bad performance of the druid. It all depends on the gear and spec of the mages tho, I have to do some calculations on 4 bis geared fire mages to see if at max level gear it can make a difference. But it is defenetly the right way to calculate your contribution. 
---
Very good point about the UI. Someone else was nice enough to point that out in a previous video as well. The thing is, I usually record my entire play session for that day and luckily a lot of the stuff I talk about in my videos happen organically as I play. Which is why I don’t have the time to switch back to the default UI. 
---
I think I may just switch back to the normal UI for the time being to prevent this. It also gives the videos a more authentic vanilla feel. I don’t need the UI to play and if it’ll improve the experience for viewers, it’s a no brainer. 
---
Thanks for the suggestion and for taking the time to watch!
---
Thank you I couldn't agree more. This sentiment drives me up the wall 
---
I forgot about that!
---
Good point!
---
True! Sorry for the confusion. I more so meant buffs to help those out in general. With that specific spell/buff, I know you’d have to technically be in a party to gain any benefit.
---
You're asking quite alot
---
I don't say things like that in wow for the record. I enjoy being a badass hunter. I just don't care about what people say in chat. Don't feed the trolls and they get bored.
---
Wrong subreddit. You want /r/wow 
---
It has good damage, but the effect isn't really very useful. Then again, I only really know the Alliance perspective, and for them, Bonebiter is the hands-down obvious choice.
---
What if you stop trying to fuck up a good thing and let us enjoy Classic?
---
You should start a movement for a Classic TBC server like Vanilla players did, then.
---
wouldn't you agree, though, that the simplification of WoW is what turned it into BfA over time?
---
Then why not roll your guild on a PvE server?
---
These posts need to die. This shit is so irritating to everyone looking forward to Classic
---
If you really want that you should push for a Classic TBC and WotLK servers and leave us Classic lovers alone.
---
I'll grant you the benefit of doubt, and assume you're trolling, but Worgen as a **playable race** has been introduced with Cataclysm, while Worgen as a monster exists since ever, it was the second main monster in Duskwood, after undead, and the main monster in Silverpine Forest.
---
No. :)
---
This is a no rush guild. We plan on playing for years. You don't have to level for half a year, you can level multiple chars and select your main later, if that is your style.
---
But I see from your question that this guild might not be for you. :) No problem, people like different things.
---
Pretty sure hunters and warriors is better for nightfall buff. a totem twisting enhancement shaman might be viable but not preferred whit improved air totems. 
---
No, I wouldn't agree that Classic WoW being accessible turned it into BfA.
---
I'm not against rolling on an RP realm (if PvE, of course). It's just that RP is not the goal of the guild. We haven't decided yet on the real kind.
---
Ret have a pretty competitive uptime, but you are correct warriors and hunters have better uptime. Shaman have by far the worst uptime of all of them and are really not viable.
---
Raiding: good luck getting a spot at all. Sorry but that's kinda how it goes.
---
PVP: even with no gear, hunters can still have oodles of fun in BGs. Watch your distance, conc shot people who get out of position, and viper sting casters. With just that much you can make the difference between a win and a loss. Then when you do have gear, you can sometimes aimed-auto-multi squishies to death!
---
I suppose it would depend on what they want for max population per server, are they going to go with the standard vanilla rates of 2500-4000 or are they going to use sharding to compensate and make it much higher?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM This should cover most of it! Dual wielding is good early on but once you level up you'll want to switch to two handers.
---
that's not what i said.
---
classic wow was accessible to some level greater than other MMOs of the time. then, throughout every expansion since classic, it has become more simplified, streamlined, and beginner-friendly -- that results in BfA.
---
I dont know how much this helps with your question but Rogue energy is a very unique resource in Classic in that you can let it refill to full and, if you aren't losing out on an energy tick at 100 energy or causing yourself to have downtime on Slice n Dice, you can wait to use Sinister Strike and just front load it for equivalent dps.
---
There are 5 devilsaurs not including king mosh iirc.
---
Pretty good video man, subbed to check other videos out later :o
---
Negatory
---
Amaxing fishing and herbing spot. Tons of Dreamfoil and more importantly Mountain Silversage.
---
You might be correct what does paladin have that gives them extra swings? I played horde for most of my vanilla days. Shamans have huge problems on other fronts aswell sins they need 2/3 debuff slots to do max dps and there is no gear for them to do sustainable dps
---
Well you pay for access to a service. If you want to play you pay the service monthly fee. I don't see anything strange here. 
---
Anything taken too far is usually a bad thing, hence retail WoW being a cesspool of miserable failure 
---
On current pservers sure, but i'm talking actual Vanilla, not pservers. 
---
Judgements and seal procs can trigger the nightfall debuff. Paladins have very comparable uptime to the other options.
---
Have you listened to interviews/stream snippets? CEO left, 2 CFO's gone recently... there's writing on the wall, and while I may not know the language, it's written in blood and that's a bad enough sign.
---
Bonebiter is better than ravager, yes, but ravager is better than whirlwind, by about ~2dps. The effect and stats are pretty much always secondary to the dps for levelling warrior.
---
This is a forum for the release of Classic WoW. If you're looking to play the WoW that is available now you're in the wrong subreddit.
---
Appreciate it, dude! Thank you!
---
Is it a bad thing? To be fair, we can only guess what the Classic Sub would be otherwise. Now, it’s possible for people to play both Classic and BfA without having to pay 25$ a month - and tbh, I think that there will be a lot of players playing (or atleast trying) both expansions. 
---
This sub is so full of people that assume every comment with the word classic and bfa or retail in it they assume it's something to do with Changes and don't even read the comment properly.
---
&gt; Is this viable
---
I donno what "viable" is in pvp. You can for sure have a lot of fun with that spec in wpvp and bgs but its probably not optimal in premades who wanna farm honor as fast as possible.
---
Yeah Classic WoW should be free because it's an old game this is bullshit
---
/s
---
I think I'm in your guild. Moo.  
---
Judging from the comments, most people clicking this threat have not seen the video.
---
Just because you spend your whole day on the Internet dont mean you should leave lame comments on everything you have already seen. Just scroll past the thread and read something else.
---
I'd say many people including me lost their screenshots from original vanilla. Like the oldest screenshots I can find are from WoW 2009-2010 and that's only because I uploaded those on Facebook.
---
Which way do we go?
---
Idfc, kill stuff
---
&gt;they start releasing sub count after they release it again lol.
---
Yeah that's the reason why sub is connected with retail. BfA is easily at all time low and it's only the beginning of expansion. However connected with Classic Blizzard will release sub count for both.
---
I don't think that the game becoming more "casual" is the reason it became like BFA, to me the downfall of wow is due to the demystification of the world through adding content that completly render the old one useless and destruction of the social and rpg aspect of the game (through raid finder, group finder etc.)  
---
And we could maybe argue that the current wow is, if not harder than vanilla, very difficult in itself and not that casual friendly  
---
TLDR : Poor design decision is responsible for the downfall of WoW (imo)  
---
Are we sure about that? I only raided whit nightfall on ot back in the day. Seems like almost all data we have nowadays is from private servers and proc chances and what procs what is all server side information. Judgements might count as spell hits
---
"Troll, worgen aren't a thing til cata"
---
So close to throwing my phone up at my ceiling
---
Ahhh back when the quests and lore had some actual effort put into them. Back when I actually read the quest instead of just following map markers and guessing what mob I've been instructed to kill 10 of. 
---
Well, an ex dev thinks otherwise. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGWzHWB5eeA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGWzHWB5eeA)
---
I refuse to believe it’s 100% necessary for you to have both PI and Weaving. At some point a different priest can step in
---
You've literally been playing vanilla wow and have never once experienced the real deal retail version? 
---
Devilsaur set is better that what you get in MC
---
That doesn't work. When the first batch of trolls get bored, the next batch will continue it. Often provoking the first batch into joining them as well.
---
This is what always happens on pservers, whether you ignore them or not, there will always be new people who think they're so original.
---
It works on private servers, but it may not on retail. 
---
You mean lightwell?
---
Hey there. I have my own playlist that doesn't go farther from 2006 and features the most viral songs of the era. If you wanna make an addition to it or take songs from it, feel free.

Don't mind the downvoters.  I want to see Hyjal and other unreleased content that was planned,
---
Dude this video literally gets posted here once a week. Don’t shame me for being on the internet all day on a gaming reddit lol 
---
This is not original vanilla, this is a private server, I recognize the guilds.
---
I was thinking the same thing my guy.. 
---
The old school Classic fans like us definitely feel this way, although TBC is still special to me.
---
But for a lot of other players TBC and Wrath is when they started WoW. This is the time period where the player population peaked and I feel like these xpacs may reel in even more players than Classic does.
---
Because it's completely and entirely irrelevant?
---
Thanks for this. Makes sense.
---
&gt; Just has abar
---
I guess this leads to the issue where abar is bugging and is restarting when an OH swing lands. This _might_ be because I tinkered with the code, but I’d be surprised.
---
I’ll revert it to default and see if it fixes the MH issue (while displaying the OH Barr which is what I wish there was a setting to hide).
---
&gt;memer#1443
---
Nice tag. Are you 13?
---
Famous last words
---
I never really understood this positioning why tune content to 1% of player base, sure there will be guilds clearing bwl on release. For me you need to tune for the majority of players if it takes the middle 50% of raiding players on average 4 months to clear I would be happy no matter how fast world first was
---
My first run back then took us about 4 hours with a guide who said he knows the way. After we ran in circles for about 20 Minutes he 'had to go offline' and we needed to find a new guide. After one experienced player offered his help we killed the emperor after just additional 2 hours
---
Can't wait for beta so I and hopefuly many more can start gathering numbers.
---
That’s rough, I thought my 3and a half hour run was a bit too long. Though hey you got a memory out of it.
---
The seal is based on weapon damage, even then the more I think of it the outlook doesn’t look good.
---
Was /world a thing in Vanilla as well? I don't remember it being there, but I was a wee little lad that used intellect on my warrior to make him 'smarter' so I might have missed a thing or two.
---
That sounds like a speed run! Only 6:30 hrs for a clear, nice. 
---
Exactly those changes are the casualization of WoW. Obsoleteing old content so players are put on an equal footing, at first through raised lvl cap&amp; expansion, then removal of attunements, then badgesystems, multi difficulty raids till we get to BfA.     
---
LFD and LFR tools to find groups for people easily. You dont have to search long times in a capital to find players to do the content you want.
---
This diary is simply awesome. There's so many super interesting things to read and shows so much how passionate these people have been to create the game that we've come to love. Whilst not solely their fault, it is incredibly sad to see what Activisions decisions have turned this game into. Knowing that decisions are made higher up I feel kind of sad for the developers who try their best to make Activisions calls into features that the community may like. It's an unfair task and the way people talk about the developers makes me wonder how happy they remain in their respective jobs...
---
You can put me on your KOS list too buddy I’ll still fuck you up if you try anything bitch
---
&gt; INB4 they start releasing sub count after they release it again lol.
---
Won't happen. Subcount publishing has been discontinued duie to liability concerns to shareholders. It was discontinued pretty much at the same time as the wow token was introduced. Analysts not familiar with how the system works could draw false conclusions and give wrong information to shareholders.
---
Classic releasing will not change that.
---
Shamans might be better tho I am sure wf could proc on hit items in vanilla like crusader enchant don't believe it can on private servers 
---
My laptop is worse than your laptop and I was getting better FPS on the classic beta than I do on retail. I get around 30 fps in the world and was getting a bit over 60 on classic beta.
---
It will more than likely be ideal to just have hunters do it and the annhilator debuff. They have similar uptime to warriors and don’t lower dps all that much. Unless shamans gain something they don’t have they won’t be a good nightfall bot.
---
Noone said 1%. What kind of accomplishment is it when any guild that cares can clear rag on its first night of attempts when half the raid is in green/blue gear? The way the game is now, with the knowledge people have and the theorycrafting thats been done i think that well over 50% of guilds that raid 1 or more times a week will clear bwl in the first week its out. This will be after farming MC for a few months. The leaderboard will not be world first or even server first nefarion kills it will be who cleared the instance 5 minutes faster. This is not what vanilla was like and thats why id like to see it retuned.
---
Frankly 4 months for the 50% sounds about perfect.
---
Agree just saying they might be better then they are now on private servers 
---
My first run was after the Cataclysm revamp so it had the teleporters and was split into three separate dungeons, although you could do everything in one go. My first run as a vanilla version was on a private server with guys who obviously had run the place a million times already because they knew exactly where to go. Kinda sad really because I looked forwards to exploring this vast dungeon. I did get to wander around the Sunken Temple for hours and hours trying to figure out the layout and that was great fun. 
---
Now I've run BRD so many times I know it better than my own town. I even wrote a D&amp;D adventure loosely based on the Marshal Windsor questline.
---
I hope classic wow never gets far enough to see them.
---
I'm in a similar situation. Have a girlfriend and daughter, mine is a bit older at 18 months. I have a fulltime job as well, but I work from home, so I don't waste travelling time. My girlfriend values doing things together as well (and I do too, just not too much), but it's not like I have to sit with her every night to watch movies. But in your situation, I'd say if you have to watch Netflix with her it's only fair if she plays WoW with you :)
---
My plan though is the following:
---
\- At the moment I am actually working more than 8 hours a day, so my GF is used to me spending a lot of time on the computer
---
\- I am free to decide at what time I start and stop with work, the company I currently work for is based in the US and they only expect me to give a small update every day, usually I wake up around 09:00 or 10:00, but I might wake up a bit earlier
---
\- Usually my GF and daughter leaves for bed around 22:00 or so
---
\- I will work until 22:00 and after my GF and daughter have gone to bed, I will spend some quality time behind my Mac, at least on weekdays :)
---
\- Probably aiming to go to bed around 01:00, which isn't much different from what I'm doing now
---
That should net met at least around 20 hours a week of game time. 
---
If possible for you, get a remote job
---
No, I think Wildstar proofed, that it's not 2005 anymore.
---
You have to be accessible, while also provide challenging content for the hardcore gamers.
---
If you loose one audience, you'll loose the other one, too.
---
If you don't have a casual audience, you'll probably not have the funds to pump out content in a steady flow. If you don't have a hardcore audience , than you're not going to have any youtube/twitch presence and the "ded game" memes are going to kill you.
---
my first full clear we got about halfway.
---
When played right a pvp beast. Pve falling off dps wise at lategame 
---
it is interesting how you guys see the visuals being the problem. It takes barely any time to create a high-poly item (since person has reference one). A good designer/3d modelling software user could create an item every like hour or so at most. 
---
its simple. Spec fury, but wield a 2 hander. The early talents in fury are much better than arms for leveling, and at lvl 40 just respec arms cause thats when it catches up. You can respec when you can get sweeping strikes if you want but sweeping strike really shines when you have MS anyways.
---
I dont see any reason to dual wield at low levels when you have no hit, just use a 2 hander with fury spec.
---
Fury spec. Get WW then Executioner's Axe. Grind rather than quest. Much faster xp grinding out mobs 2 levles lower than you in out of the way camps with decent respawn rates. Do all of your class quests for gear.
---
Fortunately I held out for a nerdy girl to come my way, she’s going to be my pocket heal resto druid
---
We sure topped the records back then
---
I did. It was amazing 
---
Good times. Think I ran BRD about 5 times before finding out Angerforge wasnt the last boss. 
---
Trollworgen are the new Allied Race in BFA.
---
This. 
---
Wrath with vanilla 'mechanics'. Eg No flying mounts or 1 unlocked at near end of the content, no dungeon finder, vanilla raid difficulty etc. I would literally just throw money at!
---
I only ended up playing hearthstone for the KFT expansion because I wanted more wrath content.
---
Yeah that's true! it's funny how i realise the concept of casualization in the sense of trading mecanism for qol is in the center of the video games problematic (or at least the MMORPG genra which tend to replicate the reality in a fantasy settings) and finding the sweetspot is the key for success !
---
A BRD full clear is one thing that I'm excited for, but the impression I got from BRD discussion on the sub was that nobody wants to do a full run. Is it actually reasonable to find groups for this, then? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/abgsj9/a_role_to_play_why_rprppvp_servers_should_be_a
---
This exact conversation was posted less than a week ago.
---
I know I’m late to the party, but holy crap thank you so much for sharing that. I was in the Barrens on my rogue getting my ass beat down by the quests following joanas guide perfectly and it lead me to quit my rogue. I’ll have to try this!!!
---
no. Transmog is terrible. I want to look at a warrior and know immediately if i'm dealing with a scrub or a problem.
---
They tried it on the classic demo. And what people remember from original Vanilla it didn't proc. Something about not being able to proc anything when sitting down. This was changed in TBC?
---
Is the electronic version no longer available? I missed the kickstarter and now I can only find the option to preorder the actual book.
---
Yes it's possible. Most people will do more targeted runs towards whatever stuff they need in there. But especially in the beginning there will be other people who want to run the whole thing for quests and such. 
---
Very nice - how sweet of your wife!   
---
Still waiting for my copy! But considering I got my Binding of Isaac: Four Souls parcel two months after the first ones I don't expect it for a while - sending to Norway takes a while!   
---
Decided to not read the PDF as I want the book experience.   
---
I'm really hoping they follow an alternate timeline. Figured that would be pretty cool, plus keep things really fresh.
---
I've done a full run with a level appropriate group and gearing and I've never do it again.  It just takes too damn long.  
---
Darkshore questing is super efficient
---
Friendly reminder that while TBC is now still seen as part of the hardcore era, when it released back in 2007 a lot of hardcore players quit the game because they felt that it was becoming too geared towards casual players. Friendly reminder that while WotLK is now a most beloved expansion due to it being a starting point for a lot of players (not saying this makes it wrong to love this expansion though), it was also the starting point of the ultimate simplification of WoW. Dungeon and raiding content was scaled down to make it more accessible, with tiered difficulty levels. Leveling was made easier, the cost and level requirement of mounts was decreased (an even bigger decrease than the original one in TBC), heirlooms were introduced, dungeon finder was introduced, catchup mechanics were introduced. Quest finder, a long since popular addon, was integrated into the client. Etcetera. WotLK was also the time when WoW had the most amount of concurrent players in its entire history.
---
While WoW was once a pioneer in its genre through an appeal to a more casual gamebase, over time it adapted to the changing needs and wants of the gaming community. It's that design philosophy of QoL features that paved the way for this. I don't think all of them are necessarily bad things. As charming as it was, vanilla certainly had its flaws. I would argue that if Blizzard had kept to its "hardcore" design philosophy it had back in vanilla, then WoW would not have survived as long term as it did.
---
I highly doubt Classic will be any good. The fringe that played it on private servers might enjoy it, but the vast majority who play/return for hype and nostalgia will probably burn out very quickly once they realize/remember what the game was really like back then. 
---
That sounds like a damn dream, unless it was because of wipes.
---
Like... fucking Shadowfang Keep has a worgen on its loading screen...
---
Don't think it was. Otherwise imagine the spam in every zone. Nobody would use /2 or/3
---
Most of those are highly overrated. I imagine that the "real" subcount won't really deviate much from the constant downward thrend. There will be a typical "new expansion" peak including classic but not much more. 
---
I seriously hope no one actually believes this. WoW classic wasn't even the most popular iteration of WoW. 
---
First off, don't level strictly fury like people are telling you.  You're going to be doing PvP whether you like it or not and mostly arms with a big slow 2h(first 5 points in Fury) is much better for that.  Respec for MS at 40.
---
Secondly leveling Herbing/Alchemy.  You're going to be using a lot health pots and it's easier to make your own.  At 60 you switch to any profession you want, but you really, really need a constant supply of health when leveling as a warrior.
---
Finally, make friends to help you with the level 30 WW axe quest and other elites quests. It's a level 37 blue that you can pick up 7 levels early.  You'll feel like a god with it.
---
I find this reasoning obnoxious and incorrect. You could take literally anything you like from Classic-Wotlk that is no longer in the game, or literally anything added in Cataclysm or later and say:
---
"See, the adding/removal of feature X clearly ruined/made WoW great and X needs to be removed/returned". 
---
There's always wipes with an inexperienced group in BRD.  But since the wings are so far away from each other you generally don't get repops.
---
Will be fun to see the same style of expansion peak followed by a return to the decline. Can't wait to see what creative excuses sycophants will have then. I can think of a few already "real ID ruined classic WoW" or "mount tab ruined classic WoW" or "New models ruined classic WoW" strike me as good candidates.

Firstly some people play PVE realms so the first comment you made was not strictly true.
---
Herb alchemy is "ok" but if you intend to switch later on that could take you a LONG time to regrind when you could be farming pre-raid gear or epic mount cash.  You are effectively adding time to the progress rate.  I would agree its useful but all pots can be bought and if you are in a guild you can often get things MUCH cheaper than the AH.  First aid should be your primary way to regain health or eating, dropping a health pot actually means you are LOSING money every time you do it as you could be selling that pot.
---
Third point, on a fresh realm good luck getting help from ANYONE with WW quest unless you are in a strong guild and you already have friends playing with you.  There is ZERO chance of getting that chain done at level 30 unless you literally have 2 other players helping you, which is very unlikely.
---
Personally I believe Classic will be a few month cash grab followed by maintenance mode. 
---
But really, it is an important question. People will spend hundreds and thousands of hours on WoW Classic. Makes sense that they are curious what will happen after a year (or two) of playing. 
---
RIP Warcraft adventures.
---
Problem is that Warcraft lore has been perverted by 12+ years of MMORPG adaptation so it will be very hard to make an RPG that isn't essentially a Disney Star Wars version (starting over in/after WC3 and anhilliating all WoW lore as non-canon). 
---
Just go with [https://classicdb.ch/?item=2243](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2243) nothing more bursty than an insta lightning bolt or insta heal
---
Human on alliance for the +5 weapon skill and Orc for Horde for the Attack Power Racial.   
---
I believe on the Horde side because of windfury weapon you might be stronger and less people will want ur swords but in the end you should pick what you like the most. a 0.5 % difference in dps shouldn't be the thing you base your character on. unless ofc you're a hardcore progression raider who wants to get world firsts..
---
I imagine that the initial surge of players will require more servers but when most of the short-timers, first timers and nostalgia trippers leave most of the servers will be wastelands, forcing some sort of merger. 
---
Depends mostly on how you going to Level. Mostly alone? Doing dungeons? Only grinding, less quests?
---
I Leveled together with a friend and went full holy until Level 52. With full holy, I had a pretty good mana sustain, a free strong heal every few minutes and holy shock was a good range pull later that also did some damage.
---
Another Option is to just go into cons and then completly prot so you can aoe grind. That also makes you a pretty strong dungeon tank. You only have a hard time against casters, try to LoS them while they are in cons.
---
If you are willing to pvp while leveling, its probably best to go into ret / prot for reckoning.
---
This is exactly the type of reasoning that ruined WoW in the first place. 
---
"I can be social if I want, what's the problem if unsocial people can just find raids from a menu with 40 randoms from 10 crossrealms?"
---
I heard this comment as I read it
---
I used to herb with my succub, when a wild rogue engages you, seduce him and it's gg
---
What about elemental shaman with staff, hitting with it between lightning bolt casts? Elemental spells dont reset swing timers.
---
Is it even Classic if a substancial part of the classes/specs are not objectivly inferior and useless in any competitive setting?
---
I remember there was a /4 named "looking for group" back in the days... On my pserver it's still there, and people often respect its sole use of looking for mates. 
---
You do realize that finally releasing Classic is a symptom of exactly the behaviour you claim to dislike, not the one you endorse right? 
---
He is not. If you don't have kids, you can't say that they are screwing your life.
---
Just because most of us moved forward in life and strive for something more than just a video-game, doesn't mean we screwed up.
---
P. S. I like playing WoW and other games, but life&gt;gaming ;) 
---
Guess you'll be sad when they roll out the store mounts for Classic servers. I'll be having a good laugh. 
---
Dont play this game please
---
&gt;First aid should be your primary way to regain health or eating, dropping a health pot actually means you are LOSING money every time you do it as you could be selling that pot.
---
​You're worried about low level money, I'm worried about time. Using a pot to avoid dying is shaving 5-7minutes off a death run followed by recouping time. All low level pots are practically nothing in price compared to money income just from grinding closer to 60.  
---
Secondly, I'm assuming this is a PvP realm, and if a warrior is caught by a rogue low on HP from grinding then he'll certainly be doing that run back without an HP pot.
---
&gt;Third point, on a fresh realm good luck getting help from ANYONE with WW quest unless you are in a strong guild and you already have friends playing with you. There is ZERO chance of getting that chain done at level 30 unless you literally have 2 other players helping you, which is very unlikely.
---
I recruited a couple of hunters I'd made friends with to help me finish it.  I was done at 33 with it.  People can be very friendly in wow.
---
They'll be forced to shard Classic once the initial surge of players fade away. 
---
Keep in mind Nost had a very high maximum-players-online cap. I remember it peaking at 15k during weekends. My point is that Nost server theoretically could’ve been divided into 3-5 realms. 
---
&gt; WotLK is now a most beloved expansion due to it being a starting point for a lot of players (not saying this makes it wrong to love this expansion though), it was also the starting point of the ultimate simplification of WoW
---
I thought I was one of the few who felt that way. I remember when I started playing in WotLK, getting to max level and doing dailies thinking "Wait a minute, I'll be turning exalted in a few weeks doing this stupid shit and I'm going to get showered in epics? That is bullshit, I worked hard for my epics in the last expansion."
---
Most other players didn't feel that way. You still had to grind a bit to get them but it was nothing like the fucking TBC reps and heroic dungeons. 
---
Sure, but there is a pretty big difference between "WoW servers shutting down forever in 20 years" and "Boy sure hope my private server/some powetripping admin doesn't delete my character tomorrow". 
---
I don't think I've ever actually done a full clear.    
---
But you can get lava runs down to about 10-15mins.
---
I'm 7/8 T2 atm on a pserver and I'm kinda tempted to go back and do a full clear just for fun, if I can find a group.
---
This excuse is literally as old as Classic and never made any sense. 
---
Lvl 1 Northshire Abbey wolf.
---
Surely it's the job of the paladin tank to educate people how to work with them. Can't exactly blame people for bot understanding the mechanics of a spec from 12-14 years ago. 
---
Don't pick an out of meta spec and then get upset when people don't understand it. Not everyone has the ability to learn the mechanics of uncommon specs. Teach people don't just blame their lack of knowledge, it's lazy and downright stupid. 
---
High water mark - Iced Earth
---
Loved that song in vanilla days
---
Did something happen when you rubbed it, or was the rubbing the entire reward?
---
Not the only one.  I quit WotLK because I was appalled at how easy the first raids were.
---
Bidwell can you hear me! 
---
Because PS are tiny fringe communities and often have admins wielding real power, neither of which existed in Classic WoW. 
---
Yeah, they're extremely badass 🤔
---
I'd go horde if you do any kind of pvp. Cos fighting orcs as a rogue, sucks. And there's less competition for swords, because horde warriors usually go for axes.
---
I never made a GM ticked for an item pre-tbc. I'm not saying you couldn't do this but I highly doubt it was possible to do this systematically. 
---
Pretty sure blizzard already said the ratio, sadly i can't remember it on top of my head. But it was something out of per 8 servers. 
---
I think it was this
---
4 PVP
---
2 PVE
---
1 RP-PVP
---
1 RP-PVE
---
It all depends on the level and what bosses people are looking for, I happened to find a good group who wanted to do different things and we knocked out the entire dungeon in about 3-4 hours. But at a certain point people might only want thaurissan and magmus.
---
PvE servers blow 
---
Ofc, somewhere down the line I just stopped caring and started enjoying the moment on pservers.
---
The fewer the better. I think it is generally a slippery slope that just opens the door to re-retailization. I think things like launcher integration and Battle.net profile integration are given.
---
TBH I don't expect much and wouldn't be surprised if they include quest pointers, mount/guild/pet tabs and all sorts of wierd menus. 
---
Yeah, Beastslaying is a dope enchantment. 
---
It's not about one particular feature that was added or removed, its about many changes that happened from Wotlk to now. Rushing through a dungeon as fast as possible without even talking a word to the other players, because you will never see them again anyway. Thats just one of the many things that are wrong today. This was way better in the past.
---
They said at Blizzcon you could do it with the ticketing system
---
It sucks, they should just not have GMs react to loot related queries. I played pre-tbc from Launch in Eu until BC launched and I never contacted a GM for loot. 
---
If classic gets more atention and players than blizzard has imagined on release then they will surely look up ways to monotize it.
---
You could be a mythic raider. I'm sure you just make excuses for why you can't.
---
I'm all for Classic but this feels a tad disingenuous. I recently leveled through retail WoW to see what I missed and there were some great quests in there that did much better than what Classic could provide. Off 
---
the top of my head, the Deathwing quests in the Badlands, and those flashback scenes recounted by that Hozen character in Panadaria come to mind. Not everything has to be black and white, guys ...
---
Swing Timers for rogues are ONLY when you have Sword Specialisation, Ironfoe, Hand of Justice or any other option that grants an extra MH Swing. When these proc, they reset the timer, and because Sinister Strike
---
It is not Sinister strike itself that resets the swing timer. If you are using Daggers, Fists, Mace Spec without Ironfoe, and not using HOJ, you don't need a swing timer at all.
---
Offhand is completely independant and nothing should ever reset its timer, however sometimes you can get Mainhand procs happening due to offhand swings. You cannot account for this in a meaningful way however other than being prepared for your mainhand swing timer to sometimes randomly reset due to an offhand swing proccing an extra attack.
---
I agree, this is even more flexible for gameplay because you can show both conflict and cooperation. A World War does not bring much to the game compared to a Cold War. 
---
Big changes ala Teldrassil could still have been brought by a third non-playable faction like the Legion. 
---
Could be that Blizz screw the pooch and release Brokentooth as veing normalised, I believe the attack speed is also normalised on a fair few pservers. If you are playing on a pserver check your server's ruleset as it could make the effort to tame Brokentooth fairly pointless. 
---
For PvE I've found that, as has been stated many times, an owl with screech is incredibly effective. Would also recommend having a beefy tank pet, some might say it is a waste, however I have managed to use my bear as a tank in early and some mid-game instances with my guildmates. It allows you to have 4 solid dps with a decent healer. Things like polymorph and trapping properly allow for cc to also reduce the amount of tanking required by your pet. 
---
Our fastest clear times have been with this comp. 
---
Not sure if it's exactly the same wolf, but lvl 18 worgs from SFK are a pretty nice choice in general, they pack a punch with 1.2 speed and buff your group with Furious Howl. 
---
Wind Serpents are also a well known alternative, they probably are the highest DPS on armored targets. 
---
Boars are a nice choice for beginning hunters, they let you engage faster and can be useful for rooting enemy flag carriers in WSG. 
---
Some hunters use Tortoises for single target farm and bats/owls for AoE ones.
---
I rather do full on ARMs from the start over any Fury. Something like this: [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxdAio0zVVzm0x](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxdAio0zVVzm0x) . Getting the 5% crit is bit meh compared to getting the utility, deep wounds, impale etc 5 levels earlier. After impale, you need 2 points to start getting crit to your weapon in ARMs spec too and impale+deep wounds are still great with +50% crit at overpower. Not to mention you save one respec (not about the 1g, its the increased price AFTER that).
---
This is more directed to ppl saying go fury spec: With proper playstyle, you will have a TON less downtime and you can kill higher level mobs than in fury without using major cooldowns. Additionally, it make low level tanking much more enjoyable, sweeping strikes is a game changer. You literally kill 2 mobs nearly as fast as you previously killed 1.
---
And tactical mastery+anger management are the best warrior skills ever.
---
&gt; due to the demystification of the world through adding content that completly render the old one useless
---
No. Demystification is an inevitability in a game with a strong community that wants to understand how the game works. The popularity of wow is what made this happen.
---
Does he get to keep the remainder of the $598,999 that was pledged on kickstarter? It obviously doesn't cost that much to release a book, regardless of quantity/quality - Forgive me if I'm naive I have no idea of how it works
---
&gt;Obsoleteing old content so players are put on an equal footing
---
Are you not aware of what raid tiers are. They were a part of vanilla.
---
Walk instead of running yes. It’s essentially whatever you make it. The best RP tends to happen in guilds though so it’s recommend to join one with a good RP reputation. For me it adds a whole other experience and is sometimes much more of a draw than end game or other activities.
---
Sword spec procs from the OH weapon too but I believe they always fire from the MH. I may have remembered that incorrectly but that messes up swing timers and planning.
---
OP: 
---
&gt; I plan to do PvE only 
---
u/Grievuuz :
---
&gt; I'd go horde if you do any kind of PvP 
---
HNNNNNNGGGGGG
---
Praise for anything made by ActiBlizzard (not REAL Blizzard) after WLK? Blasphemy!
---
Going 31/0/20 or 30/0/21 with a staff is better than this. Getting flurry and thundering strikes is wasting talent points. I played ele with ironbark staff and simply slapping windfury on it is enough to make your melee hits a real threat.
---
Legion and BFA both are garbage.   It's all due to this great man passing  ( https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/12427712802 )
---
Once he passed away right before WoD release, the team had issues attempting to keep up with his coding for spells and effects.  I feel thats why the major WoD drought happened, and classes having to be re hauled completely to the boring ones we know today. 
---
Skinning is really easy to lvl up while leveling due to the enormous amount of beasts you'll be slaying.
---
Leatherworking is not really gold rewarding but you'll be able to craft some good item for you during your journey.
---
PS : get [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18239](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18239) in BB and farm some shadow panther in STV and you'll get enough money for your mount in no time
---
You do realize that launching the game on 1.12 is a massive change to how the game really was and effectivly makes the game easier in almost every regard as the changes were generally "good" for everyone involved right?
---
Depends if blizzard launch with the nerfs (normalization) of certain pets.
---
Broken Tooth cat has a 1.0sec attack speed which is the best. 
---
Lupos wolf does shadow damage so ignores armour
---
Never in my 5-ish years up till Cata gave I created a toon on an rp realm, but I have increasingly grew curious about it. My main will definetly be on a pvp realm, but I will certainly make a character on an rp realm to give this thing a shot.
---
Yeah good point ! 
---
We know. Good job pointing out the obvious 10/10.
---
You RP as much as you like. The only things frowned upon is having a obvious anti-RP name (ex Warrior named Tanksalot) and insulting/interrupting/hassling other people RPing.
---
:DDDD thank you!
---
Tortoises were definitely dope. I got a lot of use out of Kresh from Wailing Caverns.
---
Pretty sure those will be outdated when Classic launch as they are written pre 1.12. Good try. 
---
Sounds a bit like you need a hug
---
Yeah, one of them even left their keg in the barrens for new hordies to fight over for some mediocre XP!
---
Dwarf rogue for stoneform for rogue v rogue pvp?
---
I always roll human for sword spec and yeah competition for swords can be a bitch, it starts early with cruel barb, warriors and rogues want it but so does everyone else it seems. Over the course of the full game it balances out, especially if you get yourself a core team for 5 mans up to 60 and if that core team are a core part of your guild it can help get priority on swords in raids.
---
No excuse. It isnt appealing. Retail wow just flat out isnt fun and isnt *good* for dozens of reasons 
---
If you don't find it fun that is fine but raids and M+ are by no means simple.
---
Along the same lines; what about subscription? Will the general WoW sub grant me access or should I be on the lookout for a new option?
---
Fury is better if you can use /sit to force enrage uptime. On the demo this was not possible compared to pvt servers. However, there were times duing vanilla that this was possible and there were many mechanics wrong in the demo overall that theres a chance it could make it into the final version. If it is possible to /sit to get uptime then fury is better than arms for leveling and dual wield vs 2handers dont make much of a difference. If fury isnt able to be procced with sitting then arms is better for leveling.
---
How healthy is pvp on rppvp servers?
---
The LFG chat was added really really late into vanilla afaik, it wasn't there for the majority of it. I think it also worked in a weird way and wasn't global, for example there's this quote in vanilla-wow.wikia:
---
*Looking for group (party) channel. Seen by all people in macro zone.*
---
I really hope it isn't. Dual-specc is both easy, immersion breaking and generally unbalanced. First of all it is a massive benefit to any classes with more than one role, like warriors or priests, while being relatively useless for Warlocks. 
---
But it is more than that. Dual-speccing is a typical example of exactly the type of homogenization that ruined WoW in the first place. 
---
Yeah, this was thoroughly shit upon by virtually every other person in the industry and content creators out there. Apparently he's got some personal beef, other people on reddit explained it in depth but to say it's not even close to reputable is an understatement. 
---
I don't agree. It's an inevitability of any game. Game wikis are the same thing and if you have a game with a large playerbase then you're going to get a large wiki detailing all that can be detailed about the game. Demystification is an inevitability for anyone who plays wow seriously. You can ignore all that third party information but if you want to be good at the game you have to research.
---
It's mostly quest runs which means that only one leads into the emperor room. Difficulty increases significantly when getting to the Lyceum with the fast respawning mob herds.
---
Therefore in the groups I tanked I advertised for full questrun up until Lyceum and then see how it goes, so nobody feels cheated that we break it up there after two wipes and no way we're making it. 
---
Getting some loot, the key and 13quests should be achievement enough.
---
It's actually kind of funny, comparing level 60 naxx to level 80 naxx. They increased the damage of most attacks by like 10%, despite 20 levels and much better itemization over the 40 man version.
---
Thanks for the support, unfortunately I am not thirteen. You may have to look elsewhere if you are looking for a group of friends your age.
---
For me, Wildstars biggest problem was it's world and theme. And it felt artificial (compared to Classic).
---
Generally I kept comparing it to classic all the time. It had nothing to do with difficulty or grind.
---
I did Heigan, Noth, Faerlina, Gothik, Grob, with a 36-38 opti raid and with AQ gear but with dedicated players and heavy consumables 
---
I like Pandaren though. They're cute
---
When i'm talking about new content added that make the old one useless it's about new expansion introducing new raids and making items useless etc. I don't really see how game wikis or anything like that had to do with this (but i do see how it impact demystification) I don't know if am clear tho 
---
You advance from one tier to another and realistically you gotta do one before the others. In modern wow you just do the tier that was most recently released.
---
Vanilla WoW was great; MoP was also great.
---
It's not that hard. Feel like these kind of posts just make the community look bad ^just ^^my ^^^opinion .
---
I'm still on the fence about it (and I could barely sleep last night thinking about this decision). Starshards could make disc leveling much easier, and also helps fill the gap in my soul where penance has been. Also, I believe it is one of the most mana efficient damage spells in the game?
---
In terms of efficiency Arms and 2h-fury is about equal (somewhat different playstyles and mostly comes down to taste). After that comes dualwield which due to lack of +hit is placed lower than aforementioned specs.
---
No, but the truth is that Everquest is still fairly fringe, while virtually almost every sub 40 person in the western world knows what WoW is. 
---
The fact that WoLK was the peak tells us that changes at or after that point were a negative not a positive. They should never have reused Naxx, it was lazy and disappointed a lot of players. As they continue to introduce more QoL features the player base is contracting. 
---
People want a sense of accomplishment from their games, as the difficulty of the game is reduced and the loot becomes pot luck and not goal driven the subscriber count has gone from 12 million to 3-5 million.
---
Fury is gonna be shit without sit crit
---
Rogue can level as sublety but combat is way better.
---
Mage can level as fire if they are single-target leveling. Aoe farming is generally better and having the option to do it as frost is sick
---
Warlock goes a mix of afflic and demonology.
---
Shaman can level as a mix of elemental and enhancement. Elemental not to spam spells but to improve the dagger playstyle. Generally WF with big 2hander is a slower way to level. 
---

Duskwood is my alltime favorite zone, i haven't played Alliance for 10 years but it is still the zone that sits with me the most. The quests are all cool and fitting for the zone, the atmosphere is eerie and scary, everything just fits. Probably the zone that gets me the most nostalgic when i think about it.
---
I wanna roll horde for the models, but the nostalgia truly kicks in for me in the alliance zones, and i like the alliance zones 10x as much.
---
Classic has flaws too, I pref vanilla but TBC and wrath are overall very good expansions with each a huge fanbase, it's not just vanilla that has one. Blizzard would be foolish to do anything but release TBC/wrath considered it would be incredibly easy(they have signficantly more information about it than vanilla), and it's guarenteed to succeed because of the already big established fanbases. 
---
Compare that to trying to make original content, which both takes an incredible amount of time and effort, and is also untested and we have no idea how it will be precieved .
---
Does protection warrior have more survivability? I will level as prot anyway, but I wonder if it have any advantage. I have some memories about prot being slow but unkillable, but it was TBC.
---
Them re-using Naxx isn't that bad tbh, most people on this board are way more hardcore than the average player. And the amount of people that set foot in naxx or killed a decent amount of bosses is abyssmal, so for like 95% of the population, naxx was completely new content since there was no way they could raid it in vanilla.
---
It was boring for me, sure, but i totally understand why they did that. It was a good raid but only like 5% of the playerbase ever set foot in it.
---
Lupos, Lupos and Lupos.
---
I feel MOP would have been accepted much better Kung Fu Panda had not come out yet. If MOP was first i think people would have liked it.
---
Yeah not sure where he's at with the "I know better than prot" I mean if you don't want to be a tank that's cool but I'll definitely be leveling as prot warrior.
---
All my characters are from RP-PvP servers, and even in WoD we had organized capital raids with hundreds of players. Not to mention the rare for PvP servers 50-50 faction balance. Was quite fun.
---
I hate resorting to violence!
---
Sitting for proc should only work for yellow attacks. 
---
Satyrs drop Felcloth that are needed to craft Mooncloth
---
I didn't like MOP and I didn't relate it to Kung Fu Panda at all.
---
I just couldn't take the game seriously at that point.
---
Saw a random epic mace drop off trash and after a couple hours called it quits when we got lost 
---
I’ve been fair in the past on several forums and over multiple expansions, and feel too beleaguered to repost all my thoughts here, so I shall summarize: new WoW feels hollow and bland and dumbed down, and lacks almost all the charm and character which made me love Vanilla. Better?
---
He's a camped rare though, right?
---
It’s not just frowned upon, it’s against Blizz server rules on rp-realms. If reported it can result in forced name change.
---
Felt like those went too far for my tastes tbh. I'm in the minority though.
---
For something as innocent as this?
---
Do we really have to love all games that exist on planet Blizzard and at the same time are not allowed to joke about them? Memes are the only thing keeping this sub alive because Blizzard isn't exactly trying to, in the form of news. 
---
As NE, I plan on getting a cat for PvP (prolly The Rake, screw BT) and a Wolf/Serpent for raiding.
---
The biggest issue in my opinion is the fact that WoW clones are just that, clones. I only have so much spare time and even if a WoW clone was "objectivly" better I can't switch a lifetimes worth of familarity with Blizzard/Warcraft lore, players and experience for some random IP I learned about last week. 
---
They can qeust well, offer good utility in group content with traps and pet off tanking 5 man's. They are great. Not like current hunters that have 3 buttons and sleep.... 
---
I never understood the hate that Pandaren get. Not the expansion, the race itself.
---
I loved playing one during MoP and enjoyed their lore very much. It feels like everyone jumped on the hate bandwagon just because someone popular, at some point, said it sucked.
---
Yes. Plus you don't even know if he'll do shadow damage or phys damage. If the latter is the case, he's actually not worth taming.
---
It’s just my opinion, man :P
---
But yeah, fair point: not trying to bring people down. I just really enjoyed MoP and feel like those who dis it are usually the same people that think it was made because Kung-Fu Panda was a thing.
---
Hey guys, info will be in the YouTube description so check that out there if you want the spread sheet.
---
Most likely they will have bug fixing patches at first. Then each raid unlock will have some kind of patch (maybe tweeking things that are working strangely on the new code)
---
Yeah, like the whole alliance opening scenario where you’re put into a full scale battle and end up slaughtering a bunch of POWs trying to swim for their lives...so lame and kiddie, couldn’t take it seriously either.
---
MoP was my favorite expansion and the only one that had that fun feeling of Vanilla wow imo. All the others were basically "WE NEED THOSE 10 BEAR ASSES OR THE LICH KING WILL DESTROY AZEROTH".
---
I thinks it's silly to think Activision won't put thier corperate ebola into classic somehow. 
---
You don't find out about that until you buy the product.  That is way past initial impression stage.
---
Chill, alright? This is a thread specifically asking people to talk about this topic, hence why people are throwing ideas around. Personally, I'd prefer if the game stayed in patch 1.12 indefinitely, but that's not what this thread is about. 
---
As long as that worgen ain't with the alliance it's all good.
---
Go full +shadow damage gear, spec into affli, dot everything and let the drood hot you to keep hp topped. Nearly no downtime 
---
Isn't Argent Dawn EU the realm that is full of paedophiles?
---
The opening, the first few hours, of the actual expansion is way past the initial impression stage...
---
So you play with the game stretched? Or how is it relevant how you took the photo?
---
Me and a lot of my friend had left cata at this point when they annonced it. It was just the last nail in the coffin for us. No mather what people say how good it was (doubt) the theme wasnt interesting for a lot of people.
---
Ignore most of what you will see here. This is actually what you do. 1 - Spec Arms. 2 - use slowest possible 2H axe. 3 - stack spirit.
---
stacking spirit is the greatest unappreciated trick a warrior at low levels has to make their live easier. And if you don't believe that go ahead and check it out yourself on one of the pservers
---
When they released the tragedy that was MoP I started doing something I never had before. I went to RRM and started corpse-camping and spitting on every panda I could find. I also helped the other alliance players with their quests just to up the contrast.
---
I really disliked their addition into the game, because I saw it as Activision-Blizzard bending over and letting China in. Everyone called me an asshole for it.
---
Until Diablo Immortal...
---
I'm sure there will be a beta, if only for technical reasons. Their multiplayer online experiences almost always have betas. Even stuff like D3 had a beta.
---
It won't necessarily be a long one, but it'd be kinda weird if they didn't have one.
---
"Pandas are silly"
---
Thats basically their argument. Whats the deal? You already have a race thats 1 foot tall, and giant walking cow people, why are pandas so bad? "Woah dude thats too far, muh immersion has been RUINED"
---
What news should there be? They've said what they're planning on changing, the rest of the news is that they're releasing the game in April this year.
---
We already know what the game is, there is no news.
---
Well the rules used to be enforced but not so much anymore.
---
...now that I think about it, if that’s the case I’m glad your kind left.
---
An amazing expansion set to interesting Chinese themes (such as their philosophy and battle scenarios) was refreshing. It was just a different flavour of WoW and if that was enough to turn you off then it’s actually kinda sad and I feel sorry for you guys. I love me a cheeseburger, but I’m not gonna say “get bent” if someone offers me a Rou Jia Mo.
---
Yeah that’s true, sadly.
---
Paladin tanking is fine through dire maul the biggest issues you'll run into at max level is you need defense gesr to be effective in 5 mans and non of that has int so on mine i had somewhere like 4k mana with ai. Consecration costs 800 at max level and if you do any judgements or even use holy shield you will be oom before you know it. When you go oom you will lose aggro. 
---
it does, but comparing a good vanilla quest text to a generic retail one still sounds like mindless retail bashing. There were plenty of lazy quests in vanilla as well.
---
You just got bent out of shape by s guy liking something different than you...
---
I actually enjoyed the Pandaren and the starting zone
---
I remember Solofarming the Arena as Hunter for the bis 
---
Hes talking about when the game is announced you fool. The announcement and trailer didnt have any of that in it, in fact it was a cartoony human vs orc until they team up against a panda. Not exactly “dark”
---
K
---
Do you see the addition of trolls in Vanilla as Blizzard “letting Jamaicans in?”
---
There are also a lot of people who still preorder expansions and a few millions who buy them at launch, full price is $60, that's a hell lot of money even if subs go down quickly.
---
I hope we going to see every Single Expansion at one point. Of course Vanilla, tbc and so on should always be there. With new realms every one-two years for each expansion so everyone can enjoy their fav. Expansion at one point for a long time to come 
---
:(
---
It was also my opinion man :P
---
And no problem, you're practically right about the panda haters 
---
I honestly couldn't say either way I was there for about 30 minutes total. 
---
Yup, I also started by doing same meals each week, it's what makes some people drop meal prepping because they stick with safety and grow tired of same meals after time.
---
Doing meal prep for 5 days I usually try not to pick "juicy" vegetables like tomatoes and broccoli because they tend to go bad after like 3 or 4 days even in sealed container lying fridge shelf...however they will be ok for 3 days. Canned vegetables like corn or lentils are easy lasting 5 days in container. For dinner I go with turkey / beef / chicken (fish is something I avoid, and reserve only for supper) and quinoa, sweet potatoes, rice or pasta. Also, adding curry or pepper spices to meat is nice and of course mentioned veggies. Years ago starting this thing I went with full crash course, only doing lean meal prepping without gravies or stuff like that for 2 months straight, so my body and taste adjust for that. It was good for me, but can't speak if it work for other people. :/
---
So usually, I get 10 containers, 5 for dinner and 5 for breakfast. For breakfast I go with peanut butter cinnamon oatmeal &amp; other nuts + protein powder and add banana &amp; milk when I'm at work like 80% of time (can't get enough of it, even after years lol). I usually bake my own bread and buns so it's nice change from oatmeal time to time, however baking your own stuff required more persistance and i'm suggesting not starting with that right on...
---
It definitely saves time. If I know recipes, it's mostly around 1-1.5h to make breakfast and dinner 5 days prep. Never going back to shitty, unknown quality breakfast and dinners. Saturday usually is my cheat day and sunday I always go with less strict but healthy meals. Hope i've helped a little. :)
---
PS&gt;Curry (spice for meat) &amp; cinnamon (oatmeal) is something that boost your metabolism and Fibre (oatmeal) &amp; protein (meat / lentils) keep your hunger away. Thats really awesome combination that is great for losing weight fat (not muscle mass).
---
If you do that and actually hit 300 with all of them I'll give you a cookie.
---
Oh, I can come up with some items.
---
- Sharding 
---
- Diremaul at launch
---
- AV (especially its items) releasing with AB and Wsg
---
- Items in general
---
- Aaaand ive read your comment about the game releasing in April and I got fooled xd
---
Leveling as Protection has no real benefit. You deal a lot less damage and the mitigation you get from Protection is marginal at that level, so you kill slower and while you get some mitigation, it's not enough and you end up taking more damage than Arms/Fury when the mob is dead. Tanking with Arms/Fury is still extremely easy, so you don't need the points in Defiance for threat. 
---
But by all means, level as Protection, but be aware that the cons heavily outweigh any pros.
---
I'm gonna drop you on that stack of dimes you call a neck! 
---
Anyone remember this old favourite from 2005? We named our vanilla guild "Even The Grey Stuff" in its honour. 
---
You're not allowed to make a post with the title "WoW Classic Trailer" and it not be the trailer to WoW Classic. 
---
😡😡😡😡
---
I can't disagree with you more about going fury. 
---
Fury is just plain bad before 30, and only really good at 40 once you get enrage+flurry 5/5. I have no idea why it gets routinely suggested as the optimal leveling spec. You're asking people to go from level 10 to 30 with the only real boost to their damage being 5% crit, and crit doesn't even see real value until it syncs with abilities like flurry or deep wounds. In fact, Cruelty (5%crt) offers the same damage boost per point as Imp. Rend in the arms tree (provided a full rend gets off, each point deals roughly 0.8-1.1% of the avg. mob's hp depending on how recently you trained it) Everything else in fury is garbage before the 20pt mark. Arms meanwhile has solid talents on every tier and a couple of must have abilities if you want to survive wPvP, like tactical mastery. Anger Management's hidden boost to rage generation also makes it an invaluable talent.
---
Go Arms. If you really want to play Fury, wait till 30-35 at least and respec. The cost will be regained easily in the time you save leveling. 
---
Bears are tanky, can eat just about anything, and have the best sound. You'll be hearing the sound a lot. The sound matters. Get a bear for soloing.
---
The first time I ran a mile I only ran half a mile. 
---
I've always wanted to try an RP server, but not knowing the depth has kept me away. Can you talk to guildies the same way we all do in chat? "Hey bro, how ya been?". Can you use LFG channel? Can you post things in trade? Is discussing stats, raid requirements, honor system, etc something you can do? Or will people nerd rage you for even asking these questions in game? 
---
Seriously, how can they say that pandas ruin the game when the game already had fucking corpses as a race? Undead shouldn't have been a race in the first place. How can a bunch of raised corpses even qualify as a race and why would they try to "live" among the real, living beings? I'll never understand this shit and it's why I'll never be a part of the Horde.
---
"your kind"
---
Too real :-(
---
A friend of mine had the ghost owl in I think winterspring. That damn bird could solo my rogue without any help from the hunter. My rogue was just stepping into MC gear the last time I dueled his bird. 
---
It’s ok, I can say that; best friend is cognitively challenge...and black.
---
First of all, individual guilds establish and police their "RP level" (usually light, medium, heavy) and also determines if guild chat is IC (in charactet or OOC (out of character). The guild I were in didn't RP at all except for some occasional events.
---
Chat channels are always almost out of character, no difference from other servers.
---
/say is always in character unless you specify out of character beforehand. /w can be both IC or OOC, it's up to the two participants. /p tends to be OOC chat but that's  up to the group.
---
Well, somehow, in a world full of Cowmen, Fishmen, Horsiemen, omegamidgetmen, ratmen....
---
....Pandamen are just too childish and not serious.
---
Nice bait, but it's not worth spending the time to explain basic things to someone so needlessly pedantic, so you're not gonna get a rise out of me. Toodles\~\~  
---
    
---
I find it highly unlikely you are in the minority on that.
---
Did you play TBC or Wrath? I have played all expansions but only a few months combined from Cata-Legion. I think that they all have different things for merit. 
---
I hated Cata when it came out. It ruined the world. BUT, The dungeons were good and fun and the heroics were nice. I did NOT like Tol Barad. So few zones and only 5 LEVELS!? 
---
MoP expanded on the 5-level train to "fix" a lot of these things. It also introduced a variety of new zones and if I'm being honest i really enjoyed them all. I played late into the expansion so i was only doing the LFRs to see the raids and i never made it very far into SOO. 
---
Warlords was fun as hell until you got to max level and even then the first couple raids were OK. I loved the treasure hunting! It felt like i wanted to explore everything which reminded me a lot of Vanilla and of course this was the throwback expansion to TBC!
---
When Legion came out i think i played the most i have since Wrath.   We cleared m+ over and over and it was a great thing to do in between raids, and by the time heroic EN came out we were already outgearing it. I did NH and didn't play again due to IRL stuff but i hear that it also ended the expansion very well. I have not played BFA. 
---
I would say that TBC was, of course, the most vanilla-like. Followed by EARLY Wrath. 
---
That questline is so bad. WOOHOO 5 BEERS! Now go get some more thunder lizard giblets. 
---
Its server by server and depends what kind of pvp. Emerald Dream is a US RP server that has a ton of wpvp with intense rivalries between guilds and the factions. If you want rated play with better premades then I'd avoid RP servers.
---
Any EU guilds recruiting warriors? Alliance side.
---
Not my fault that your reading ability is sub-par, sorry for upsetting you. 
---
Also so sorry about the alliance thumbnail ... i just liked the art compared to what else i could get a hold off....
---
I feel blizzard relied way to much on chinese stereotypes with the Pandaren. Feels like they just threw in kung fu, random wise messages and chinese buildings without trying to make it fit with the world of Azeroth. I like the Pandaren by themselves, but all of Pandaria has a huge dissconnect from the rest of the game. 
---
Blizzard has done blatant inspirations from other cultures before (Tauren, Vrykul, etc) but at least they feel natural in the game. 
---
Where excatly did I claim the paladin didn't also have responsibility? 
---
Many people are simply unwilling to try because people have been fed the same misinformation for at decade that paladins aren't viable for tanking.
---
That'll be a 'yikes' from me.
---
what really killed me was that in warcraft 3 the pandaren brewmaster hero was there as a joke. it was a fun easteregg type thing. MOP felt like taking that joke too far, and even tho they seemed to take the expansion seriously, to me it’s origin completely tainted any themes or design choices or anything with silliness, and it felt weird and inappropriate to build an expansion around it.
---
It’s meant to be a play on joke, but eh; you win some you lose some :/
---
The line about "If your group fails, it's not your fault". Reads like it's on everyone to know about a relatively niche spec for vanilla.
---
wait... what? 
---
They've added tauren Paladin to classic? lolwut? 
---
Brandon thinks he does but he doesn’t.
---
Listen. Blizzard has themselves said Classic will be like if you fell in a coma during 1.12, and woke up during the summer 2019, you would not notice anything different.
---
They won't add achievements, transmog, JC or dual talents. It's kind of a pointless topic.
---
If starshards is the big deciding factor, then i wouldnt worry about it. Starshards is pretty lack luster and thats from someone who started saying a thread saying lightwell has a time and place.
---
I got "the Rake" on my NE Hunter on a private server. It was a long walk to get him at level 13 running through Duskwood, STV, the Barrens to Mulgore. But I got to say it was definitely worth it. My pet does (almost) more DPS then I do. (level 22 hunter now) Attack-speed is 1.1 and the damage is great.
---
I mean... I kind of disagree. Viking architecture doesn’t jive in the slightest with the simplistic wooden and spiky building style of the Horde. Plus, in regards to the Pandarean building style... they’ve lived on an isolated continent for thousands of years, why would their architecture be even remotely similar? 
---
I feel like a lot of people who make complaints about the aesthetic of MoP never played it. 
---
Hitting 300 in all of them isn't as special as you might think it is. It's tedious to do, yes, but it is achievable quite fast actually...
---
referencing new classes for classic races..  
---
I'm against that..
---
&gt;a new respect for good hunters
---
The bad ones certainly make the others look good don't they?
---
No I said it's a L2P issue, not a class issue. Stop assuming I say things between the lines.
---
I mean... obviously? lol 
---
They aren't going to anything that drastic. 
---
I'm not Blizzards biggest fan right now... especially after recent shenanigans. But they aren't THAT stupid. 
---
I know about that, i just like to read your opinion about that  
---
I'm addind fluff flair to be more clear =\]  
---
&gt;someone who shows clear signs of smugness about the choices they made and distain towards those who say otherwise.
---
:thinking:
---
Hunters start shining early on the leveling, then fall off pretty fast and only start rising again when Burning Crusade comes around. BC has been the best expansion for hunters in my own opinion due to the difficulty of playing it correctly (auto shot timing, explosive shot timing, correct stat weights, etc...)
---
Two weapons means missing the target an insane amount of the time. A 2-hander weapon is the go to for leveling and pretty much no-one will argue otherwise. There's tons of debate about the viability of fury vs arms early on, but more important is how you approach fighting mobs. At 40 I'd still highly recommend going arms for MS though. It's a huge deal.
---
BT and a wolf later on for raiding is optimal. Lupos is only good before the patch that removes its shadow damage. Wolf for furious howl in pve, and BT for pvp.
---
No changes. 
---
Other pros/cons is that Alliance has Paladins and Fear Ward. Horde only has Shamans.
---
You say you will only PvE, and on the private server scene the PvE heroes prefer Alliance, while PvPers prefer Horde. This means more raiding guilds on Alliance side. Potentially.
---
If you go Horde you get WF totem. If you go Alliance, you get Kings and Salvation. What gives the highest DPS increase? I would think Alliance overall, but I am sure someone has done some calculations on it.
---
You only compete against the other DPS on your own faction, so why does it really matter though?
---
Sword spec is the best on Horde side for Rogue too, so the competition for them will be the same among the Rogues. Then again, Fury Warriors on Alliance might be more interested in stealing your swords than on Horde.
---
Other than that you can look at how far you have to fly and walk to get to raids and dungeons. I remember a class mate of mine during Vanilla complaining Alliance had such an easy time to get to MC/BWL compared to Horde. I don't know if this kind of stuff matters to you.
---
I would go Alliance, but I always prefered Alliance.
---
Achievements? 
---
Absolutely NOT. Achievements are nothing but imaginary content. Adding absolutely mundane tasks to the game for the sake of achievements is not content and therefore shouldn't be in this game.
---
All customization from characters?
---
What are you thinking here? Haircuts and stuff? Eye colors? Sure, I wouldn't mind if those somehow made it into the client. Anything else? Big NOPE.
---
Jewelcrafting?
---
Go away. Classic has MORE THAN ENOUGH things that you need to farm and bring to a raid (IF you'd do them all). Adding more would be absolutely insane.
---
Second Talent Build?
---
Again: NOPE. Why? Quite simple: identity. It is quite important to get known as a good healer/tank/dps throughout classic. It's your identity it's who you choose to play. Furthermore it would be near impossible to get an adequate amount of gear in both specs to perform the roles you want. While I do see some benefit (MT is sick, some random warrior could swap and done), they would never outweigh the negative things coming with it.
---
Other than all of the above:
---
NO CHANGES. NO SYSTEM CHANGES AT ALL. This is about classic. This is what the classic community wants. If you want Jewelcrafting then wait 1.5 years and start petitions to create a second classic realm with Burning Crusade Progression. If you want Achievements wait about 5 years and call out for a third classic realm with progression up until Wrath. That's simply how it's going to be. There won't be any "mix mashing of features" from either AddOns simply because finding the "right feature-set" is impossible. People would not be able to agree on features therefore "NO CHANGES" is quite literally the only way to go.
---
I'm playing Burning Crusade with Legion and WoD models along with maxed console settings and I have to say I highly recommend it.. It's the closest thing you'll ever get to playing a classic version of WoW but remastered/HD 
---
Nah, you are still just as much of an asshole. 
---
Sure, if the person is being fast with it while doing all of the items. You have to consider some exhaustion factor or design factor. Design being, that making the new item isn't just re-coloring it. If we look at Saurfang in BfA, this is how T1 Warrior set would look, for instance. I doubt that took an hour to make. I think that with a good supervision, feedback of design team and probably even community and a good software used by an experienced designers, it could take a day or two to remake a whole tier set for a team of designers. Considering there are 9 classes and 3 tiers, that is 27 to 54 days already (still quite optimistic), totally excluding weapons and shields, other non-raid epic items, rare items and even green items like the green lion shield that made this post. That is well over a thousand of extra items, of which a lot also require good supervision and preparation. Let me give you a couple of examples from my head: Arcanite Reaper (HOOO), Ashkandi, Skullflame shield, Ironfoe, Perdition's Blade, Currupted Ashbringer, All of the PvP armor weapons... a lot of things. With gear would come the problem of having old mounts, with mounts would come race models, with that could come asking for re-make of some boss models or cities and a lot of unnecessary and generally unwanted changed. That said, fuck new models and reworks and let's enjoy our 5 pixels of epicness! 
---
agreed 100%. A lot of people can't wrap their heads around this point. Even though content wise MoP may have been executed decently, the idea of using a single artists' easter egg design (Samwise in this case) and making a playable race based on them seemed inappropriate to me as well. I wouldn't have even minded if there were Pandaren but frankly only if they were NPC's and few in number. One of the reasons Chen Stormstout was cool in Warcraft 3 was that the Pandaren were so rare and mysterious. Now they're just another race like any other nothing special about 'em really 
---
Right, good long elaboration. I am by no means disagreeing. Only that we should watch aoe - in my experience as a mage, paladin aoe pulls in gnomer, which is where I tried it, went better than udual. Also, why would one whine over bos - it is howver better than nothing, which is what you’d have if you were waiting and taking a druid/watrior tank...
---
I really want a better working AH than what was in vanilla. I see no reason what so ever to not implement that. 
---
It's the same as on normal PvP servers really.
---
There's just no UD rogue named 'iganknoobs' stealthing around in redridge.
---
It would be an UD rogue named 'soulstealer'...
---
And bg? Are they also cross server so it doesnt matter?
---
u talk like my post could change something about the vanilla version..  
---
keep cool man, it's a mind game, good things for new versions that could rly bring more fun to a ... 1.13.0 version of the game.. i don't know  
---
and things u rly hated from newest versions.. just choose a top 3, is not that difficult
---
Nothing.
---
The reality is that on RP servers, perhaps 10% of the people actually RP.
---
Early weeks, plenty of RP everywhere, especially in /s and in general channels. Some guilds have purely RP guild chat as well (and a dedicated OOC -out of character- chat often)
---
After that, the actual RP slowly dies out as guilds reach endgame and the freshness of the server dwindles. 
---
In the end it's only the die-hard RPers that still RP. 
---
Experience: 2 years on RP PVP, 1 year on RP PVE server.
---
I don't think anyone is claiming that the raids or high level dungeons in retail WoW are simple, but that doesn't make up for the rest of the game being terrible.
---
The problem with retail WoW isn't that there's a small pocket of hard content at the "end game" which makes up for like 5% of the total game.
---
The problem is that to get to that content in the first place, the whole remaining game is literal garbage and you have to put up and go through that whole 95% of the game before you find 1 small thing at the level cap that you can enjoy.
---
Also, even the whole loot box mentality applies throughout the whole game and applies to raiding as well which ruins that aspect of the game as well even if it would otherwise be good.
---
It's just a casual game experience overall and isn't fun to play through, just because there's a very small pocket of content that takes up a few % of the game at the end of it doesn't mean that the majority of the game isn't a bad casual experience, and for me if the only good part of a game is a small portion of it at level cap then it's just a terrible game to play through because I don't wanna put up with the rest of the 90%+ casual content just to get to the "fun" part, it's not a game worth playing at that point.
---
Also, lots of mythic raiders also think even raiding is in a terrible state because you have to farm some meaningless traits and the loot system is terrible etc. So even if the content itself might be fun the way all of the features are designed around it makes it a worse experience than it could be.
---
Ok, I guess I'm gonna go with Dwarf. I supposed stone skin is more useful than shadowmeld, too (in both PVP and PVE). I was leaning towards Night Elf for other reasons - the first character I leveled back in Vanilla was a Night Elf Druid, so Teldrassil would give me the largest nostalgia overdose. Also, I want to look and smell like Priestess Tyrande. Dwarfs are ugly and smelly... but I am willing to accept the RP challenge.
---
Stoneskin is also amazing in AQ and naxx but shadowmeld makes camping worldbosses ez mode.
---
the difference is that pandas were the first race with the new "disney"-like character design and animations. sure now all the races look childish and silly (to me at least), but back then every other one still had the rugged vanilla look, and compared to that, pandas were a different direction
---
Interesting that this is brought up in classic wow. I’d argue that a lot of the quality of life changes like LFG finder were just removing the need to fight the UI. Posting your group on a board and spamming trade are practically the same thing, one is just significantly more efficient. 
---
My plan upon release:
---
* Roll troll hunter
---
* Go to Eldrassil (and die a gazillion times)
---
* Tame owl
---
* ...
---
* Profit
---
Thing's I've hated are quite easy:
---
All class changes post BC. Dungeon Finder. Methods for obtaining Loot.
---
I'm pretty much under the impression that BC was the best state of the game that we've had. Wrath had higher numbers, sure, but I believe a huge contribution to this is because of the success of previous releases and the fact that Games in general have become more socially acceptable. Changes made to the game during WotLK also made things much more casual friendly and things quite frankly just went downhill from there on.
---
That being said, Ulduar was the absolute best Raid this Game has ever seen.
---
Okay, great.
---
i can't remember, in Vanilla the AH was separated right?  
---
booty bay AH lists itens there isn't in orgrimmar AH or stormwind AH
---
What in the actual fuck
---
This is exactly why there will be sharding in the beginning. Tourists will do either of those things:
---
1. They are almost certainly going to level slower than the dedicated fans.
---
2. They will possibly give up quite soon because they can't find quests or where to do them.
---
3. They will very likely give up around level 25-30 when question becomes a bitch because you have to travel the continents to find appropriate leveling regions.
---
4. Actually become dedicated members to the community.
---
Neither of the above has a lasting effect on server player numbers after a certain time. Therefore things will go quite smoothly.
---
Tourists won't know they are tourists untill they quit.
---
Some people will come with the intent to play for years and quit on lvl 30, while others will just see what all the fuzz is about and end up loving it.
---
Blizzard needs to handle the tourist population and "dead servers" vs "overpopulated severs" way better than they did in Retail. Cross realm was introduced because they refused to force merge servers. Let's see if they make the same mistake again.
---
I just hit lvl 30 on a privat server but never played vanilla before, do I count as tourist ?
---
I personally don’t like the 9 points in shadow for touch,reach and weaving.
---
I think the arey better used in disc or holy.
---
Oh glorious gatekeeper!
---
Please tell us peasants what we must do to become 'true' fans of this game, oh glorious one.         
---
Jokes aside, there should be a try-hard server option so we can avoid people like that easily :)
---
Chen Stormstout was a part of the entire Founding of Durotar campaign, you helped him make his brew and he joined you during the whole campaign.  
---
I don't really see that as pandas being a "joke", sure, there were easter eggs in both RoC and TFT with pandas, but they became apart of the lore in The Frozen Throne, to some extent, thanks to Chen.
---
Never ever Dual Wield for Leveling! You get a 25% Misschance with DualWield and you have no Items with +Hit% to counter that while Leveling.
---
And why exactly? Wouldn't it be more immersive if there were less 'powerful' adventurers,not only generals and heroes? 
---
We should't limit this experience only to hardcore fans - when vanilla started, nobody was a hardcore fan either. 
---
Hmm... but if I am camping world bosses, I am likely with a group, so the shadowmeld won't really do that much for me?
---
My issue with this expansion was how most (if not all, has been a while for me to remember it correctly) classes was available to every race. I thought that at least monk would be reserved for the Pandas since they just came into contact with the world, but no, each race got it immediately. This made no sense, why would each race have the same class ...
---
Second thing that bugged me (but it's more of a personal view) was this "neutral" race decision of blizzard. It would've been much more interesting for Pandarens to would've been really neutral and could enter horde and alliance territory, but could be attacked in PVP areas by both factions and invited to team up (raid, dungeon or questing party). 
---
Thats what I thought. I get that people don't like BFA or Diablo Immortal but the stormtroopers shooting Overwatch didn't make much sense.
---
In my experience, 2 Hander as 2 Handed Fury was best for leveling. 
---
Also, make sure you're hamstring kiting. 
---
While technically true that spirit is more beneficial than most recognize, the coefficient of it compared to the damage from raw STR and extra HP from STA still outweighs it.
---
If you find spirit and and stamina or spirit and strength they're good together, but you don't use only spirit.
---
I lvled with a windserpent, good for solo leveling and pvp but not enough tanky for tanking dungeon or more than 1-2 elites
---
Looks like someone needs to read up on their very basic WoW lore...
---
There will be tourist servers. When tbc servers come out, they will all go there. It'll be like a leper colony without the guilt. 
---
Yeah, especially because of that I'm thinking about taming a gorilla in addition to my owl
---
Yeah I have looked into the stacking spirit strat, seems legit. I leveled up to 20 on a pserver, definately enjoyed very little down time with a lot of spirit. I think I will try this when it goes live.
---
From experience, go arm and use a 2H for best performance.
---
I still prefer to dual wield from 20 to +-30 just because it looks way cooler and the gameplay is a little more smooth but in the end it doesn't change much to your journey
---
Not entirely fair to insinuate they get nothing until 30, as they also gain access to Blood Craze which, combined with using /sit and hamstring kiting and lead to fairly efficient mob chains. 
---
While Arms provides Improved Overpower at the same time, it's not necessarily a direct improvement over the other, in my experience. 
---
Having people helping scout world bosses? Boy your funny, i like you.
---
Couldn't agree more. I don't understand why these people think that Classic needs changes to be able to keep alive. Classic is being kept alive by our monthly fees. There's not much Development interactions going on and the support tickets are likely not gonna be massive either. It's gonna be a steady influx of money for relatively few work. People should stop thinking that the costs on Blizzards side (years from now) are even remotely close to what they have to spend to develop further addons.
---
If anything later down the line we'd see more servers with more progression (TBC, WotLK). That's also when we would see paid Services to bring our characters from e.g.: classic to the tbc-server. Possibly Character Boosts to level 58 on the TBC Realm, etc... this kind of stuff.
---
Only problem with gorilla is that the first one you would be able to tame are +- lvl 35.
---
Boar is underappreciated for his performance, you might want to try one until you're able to tame a gorilla 
---
Yes, I agree.
---
But be fair to also admit there could be *something* you like within the game still, even if it doesn’t make it worth playing.
---
THEY'RE FUCKING DEAD. They do not function like every other race, all of the living races do not want them and would destroy them immediately if they didn't have other pressing matters and Slyvanas is a colossal bitch that doesn't even look undead, just a reskined blood elf (how's that for consistency). Undead can't be a race, they don't have a normal way of reproducing, they are hated by everyone and they were created from the remains of other races. Everything about them is absolutely foul, I fucking the undead so much.
---
&gt; rugged vanilla look
---
I'll be honest, this is the first time I'm hearing someone call it "rugged". I still vividly remember the big criticism that WoW looked cartoony compared to all the others.
---
What they said about the community is so true. The 10k pop servers can be almost as impersonal as retail, because there are too many people. Much lower chance of meeting the same player twice. Instant grouping means you don't have much of an incentive to get to know the good tanks/healers etc.
---
This sub is starting to become REAL toxic real fast. What the hell is the point of this post. The so called tourists wont know they are tourists until they become bored and quit. What u reckon? We should all sign a waiver that players swear to stay on the server for your amusement?
---
While an owl is really cool, I hate the part where you have to get into Darnassus. There are so many guards near that teleporter and they graveyard is extremely far away. I wonder if there are easier ways of getting on top of the world tree.

No changes is already lost. The game will start on a later patch which makes the game much easier, drastically change various classes and balances as well as add new content that wasnt in the original game at the time. 
---
Hahaha, Classic sure brings out the weirdos and elitists, doesn't it? 
---
You realize most oldschool vanilla players are in their mid 30s now and many have families? That usually negates playtime with a high amount. Dedication isnt pure playtime. You can be a dedicated vanilla fan and play for 6 months to hit 60, and you can be a non dedicated player who rush 60 superfast then quit. Who would you list as the most dedicated player here?
---
The first and second part give decent xp, the third part really screws you. It's a level 24 quest, and you get 975xp after having to kill kodos dragonhawks and thunder lizards in the Southern Barrens. In comparisons, other level 24 quests, Owantanka (kill a single thunderlizard) gives 1450xp, and Weapon of Choice (get certainweapons off of Quillboars) gives 1950xp.
---
Played it, didn't like it.

That said, based purely on aesthetics Pandaria is gorgeous, no question about that. I just feel the continent doesn't fit with the tone of WoW.
---
About the chest, can't remember ever experiencing it on the EU servers I played on - perhaps some etiquette from the US? All groups I was in, it was usually the guy that first found and looted a chest, got to get the contents.
---
its because we went from warhammer 40K inspired mmo , to Dev takes his kid to see Kung Fu Panda and then makes it into WoW after pitching it to the board of directors that it will be their hook for the Chinese market.   
---
What I most enjoy about 2-4k caps (afaik the real big realms had that high of a pop at peak) is that you have on and off times. Being a shiftworker, having off randomly on a tuesday morning or else makes you appreciate to farm uncontested. 
---
On pservers with 10k population it's ALWAYS a battle for every nook and cranny. It can be really draining if you just want to leisurely run a dungeon and have to run a gauntlet of the opposing faction's honor farmers.
---
User name checks out. Here's some advice, you should probably stop now.
---
Ok, I think I understand what you mean. My modus operandus for a world boss I want is to set my hearth as nearby as possible and go check it a few times a day. I guess with Shadowmeld you would just afk there and tab in to check it out every few minutes. In reality, I think I would just log out an alt there and log in periodically to check... so Shadowmeld still wouldn't be totally necessary?
---
Can't you just agree with me and tell me that Dwarf is, uncategorically, the race for me so that this decision can be easier?
---
I'm kind of hc, doing speedruns, WB &amp; others.
---
Rend buff is another Horde bonus I forgot to talk about
---
That's exactly what I'm saying though. It's only at 29 you can go 5/5 enrage and gain value from using /sit. Blood Craze only minimizes the extra damage you'll be taking from deliberate crits, you surely would be better off spending points on talents that shorten fights.
---
Fury is a very bottom heavy tree and provides a much more uneven leveling experience, you go from being a weakling to being a powerhouse. You're better off respeccing into it once it gets good if you really want to.
---
Have you listened to the snip? The Nostalrius example explicitly states that communities work just as well with higher population capacities. Personally I believe that the population limits should be between 5-10k.
---
If we'd take 10k per server (or 5k per faction) then we'd have probable only 3/5th of those players on your respective levels. There's always gonna be people in lower levels or higher levels, etc... So the amount of people you'd interact with is maybe something along the lines of 2.5k. Now hopefully we'll see many big guilds form with something like 50+ players per guild. This means that we'd have about 50 Guilds on any given Server. That's a very small amount of number and everyone would be able to associate those guilds with any given reputation. You might not always remember the exact character name (hello xlegolasxx) but you'd always remember "that hunter from &lt;the crushers&gt;".
---
So "working communities" on realms with more than 2500 players are absolutely possible. A limit of 2500 could actually be bad and almost impossible to achieve given the huge amount of players that are going to start to play but will fade out over just a couple of months due to the "difficulty" of wow classic. Precisely the reason we'll see sharding to prevent dead servers. Raising server capabilities is another way to prevent dead servers.
---
So while I do understand the sentiment of "2500 players per server feels like an awesome community" I do not believe that a higher number will necessarily destroy this experience.
---
&gt;Elemental spells dont reset swing timers.
---
they do, it was bugged for a long time on certain well known private servers, but fixed since as it was proven it did in fact reset the swing timer.
---
TY
---
Oh I agree. I played in 2005 and I've played on private servers and it's night and day. 
---
On authentic realm caps you recognized players all the time, even players you never interacted with. On private servers you recognize big guilds but individual players are just one huge anonymous blob.
---
Maybe I am misusing the word rugged, but I think cartoony can still look rugged. But thinking about it, maybe it was more the animations. Like when a character starts talking in retail right now, is what kills it for me. I could find this video for example:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q65c2pY6P9U
---
The new one reminds me of some random disney cartoon. Don't know how to say it but its like, too dynamic...
---
Windserpents are the superior flying type and people won't hate it as much in groups as owls/vultures/bats, who are notorious for hogging lots of screen space in crowded dungeons. They look cool and have neat animations.
---
For Pet 2, go crabby for tankiness.
---
I usually kept slot 3 open to tame random shit and try it out.
---
&gt; The Nostalrius example explicitly states that communities work just as well with higher population capacities.
---
Yes, Mark Kern said that Nostalrius made it work. It doesn't change the fact that Classic was intentionally designed with a ~2500 cap in mind. 
---
I bet you could make a lot of changes to the game and still get away with it, but should you and where does it stop?
---
Do we want authentic vanilla or do we want something that's kinda vanilla but not really??
---
Agreed. Admittedly WoW has always had a cartoony feel compared to other RPGs at the time of it's release, but with the way MMOs have evolved the vanilla style has gotten a more rugged feel to it.
---
I like the Pandaren, play one myself, but when they were released it was *jarring*. It was like going from a fantasy movie into a cartoon, it felt so wrong. Didn't feel like I was in Azeroth anymore. And I think it pissed a lot of people off, since it confirmed WoW was heading in a new direction and leaving behind the more down-to-earth feel we now associate with vanilla. 
---
I'll copy-paste my own thoughts from another post months and months ago, regarding a straw poll for desired server caps:
---
"I also don't think folks are really running the numbers on this, either. There are what, forty zones in Classic WoW? And that's including practically empty shit-assed spaces like Deadwind pass! If we're talking concurrent players, I can't imagine how anyone would ever expect to get anything done. At a 5k server population, even if like 20% of all players were in instances or capital cities, that comes out to fifty people per zone per faction. That's bottlenecks everywhere you turn, stolen enemy tags nonstop, quest item spawns on constant cooldown, and if you're on a PvP server, that's like half your playtime running back to your ganked corpse. And what happens when everyone starts hitting 60?
---
That sounds like a nightmare. And the second most popular opinion is TWELVE THOUSAND?"
---
I've read discussion points before and since, and nothing has so much as budged my feelings on the subject.  I'm open to being wrong, but trying to play on a 10k pop server, especially if it's PvP, is nothing short of excrutiating **unless** your sole goal is to spend every second outside of town fighting the opposite faction to live, and the same faction for spawns.  You can even see in that clip Esfand's weak-tea attempt to justify a higher cap: "I like the concept of having a big server, ...to me, that's more people to meet."  Like, if you *somehow* (and this is unrealistic) met and fostered 10 meaningful friendships every day on a 2500-cap server, it'd take you eight months to approach the player cap's worth of friends.  And that's just the concurrent cap - there would be more players and *certainly* more characters than 2500 on a busy server.
---
In my opinion, the single strongest point I've seen for a higher cap is that server communities are less prone to dying off as interest wanes and people unsubscribe.  I think this is a fair observation.  However, that typically wasn't a problem on high population servers even back in Vanilla, it was just a problem for the servers that never got to high populations in the first place, and that's a separate problem from server caps altogether.  And my counterpoint would be that it's much harder to foster a server community in the first place when people are crammed in like sardines.  Thanks to the pserver community, we don't have to theorize about this - the chat channels are a *fucking cesspool* more often than not.  And these days, it's not your benign Chuck Norris in the Barrens chat, either.  The more people there are, the more inbred bleating you have to wade through to try and have actual conversation.
---
I understand your point and it's true. Those players aren't the issue though ;)
---
And I would believe that anyone who "rushes" to 60 is gonna stick around for quite a while since even "rushing" to 60 means spending about 120+ hours in the game. That's usually not something you'd do if you want to just throw away your toon.
---

---
Show me where the big mean Undead touched you.
---
The true choice for a rogue is due to one important factor: stealth animations.
---
Orc: Great sneak animation
---
Human: Bad sneak animation and bad animations in general.
---
A better choice Alliance side would be dwarf.
---
I think that if you just churned up the difficulty of Wotlk and remove the dungeonfinder that's introduced later, it'd be a perfect spritual successor for TBC. The classes all played well and beyond like 2-3 specs in ICC they were all viable, raids were fun as fuck with Ulduar being beloved as hell for good reason, and the lore AND character-driven storytelling was *actually good* for once.
---
Wotlk heroics were a joke and I would prefer Naxx and EoE to be actually challenging. OS3D was hard but it's a boss in a box so meh.
---
Well, pretty much all private servers are running on 1.12 though... Sure, their progression mimics the original ones, but classes are all on 1.12 status. And I agree that it absolutely sucks that Dire Maul is in the game from the get go but then again. It's 5 man content that Blizzards wants to see in the game and I would kind of argue that this is for the better.
---
Technically they are not changing the game. They COULD just release 1.12 as is and have people just start to level and play all the raids within the first month. That would NOT be "changing the game".
---
Everywhere. Damned filth, I hope they all get written out of the universe at some point.
---
this, this , this
---
Perfect reply to getting REKT kid
---
You have experience of this?
---
They’re arguably one of the coolest races in the game. It was an Undead Rogue wasn’t it.. did he cannabalize your asshole after corpse camping you. Was that the final straw? 
---
As a late-comer to Nost -- I was able to level, group, PVP, and even find a raiding guild about six months before it closed.  So while guilds were clearing BWL, many were still 'finding' Nost and beginning their Vanilla journey.
---
The one thing I preferred about Nost was the inclusion of the EU and the NA population.  There is nothing like finding out different strats for the dungeon and raid bosses compared to what / how your guild killed them.  I was awestruck to find a tank for SM who actually had tanked in Vanilla, and never let one single mob through to the rest of the group.
---
I guess with the larger servers, you can get everything -- except a closed-knit community.  But those were created by the friendship of guilds helping one another -- by alts helping another guild, by another guild's MT guiding a newly formed guild through MC /BWL for the first time.  Plus, there were casual guilds galore, there were raiding guilds galore, and there were twink guilds  galore that you could join, chat, and just enjoy.
---
But the world PVP, the vastness of four to eight guilds battling it out WITH NO LAG.  That is what the designers of WoW envisioned, it was just the technological restrictions that stopped it from being realized; that and money.
---
2,500 will not be enough of a population.  We will have dead servers.  Cap it at 5,500 or 6,500.
---
Do crabs actually have a decent skill? I remember in BC I think they had a skill to hold enemies in place which made them great in PvP, but in vanilla, all they have are high armour und HP stats, right?
---
&gt;If you wanna hit people in melee as elemental get a hand of Edward the odd for some instant cast lightning bolts and hearthstone shenanigans
---
using a 2hander as elemental is totally viable and if you are not doing it you are playing sub optimally. Usually you'd use a staff (one of the best ones is the one from ZG with 64 dps 3.8 speed) since you don't need the enha talents to wield it. Against mage/priest etc, there is really no reason whatsoever to not equip a 2h and put WF on it, even with full caster gear and zero points in enha a windfury proc can blow up a caster. 
---
I agree that OPs build is kinda bad, but going for say, 36 ele /15 enha with the intention of using a 2hander vs casters is a decent PvP spec and a good alternative to the usual 30/0/21 spec. Probably not in premade pvp, but anywhere else. 
---
Raided mythic a lot in Legion and also did a lot of heroic/mythic raiding in MoP. BFA has a lot of design errors.
---
What does one thing have to do with the other? Yes, Mythic raiding's hard, but the feel of gratification after killing a boss for the billionth time *but this time it's actually hard* kinda sucks. I'm fine with a normal and a hardmode, but having 4 difficulties to run through sucks all the magic out of the actual encounter.
---
Special heroic-only phases should be standard, hardmode-only bosses make people crave actually getting in there, even if they aren't all that hard, and I strongly believe that if you've seen a boss in LFR, normal and Heroic, Mythic just doesn't excite you as much as "Okay you've done the easy mode. NOW the bosses will actually try". 
---
Still has a way for PUGs Wotlk style but also has the feel of satisfaction of killing Bosses. If Blizz had just iterated on top of TBC and Wotlk, I think BFA would be far better. This comes from someone who somewhat enjoyed Mythic raiding and was really good at it, with several top parses in Legion on UHDK. 
---
He's using confirmation bias. Viking architecture is fine for him because it came in the original trilogy.
---
Some folks, for one reason or another, may not want to spend the middling gold amount to respec at that level.
---
I know it seems like a silly thing, but even for me as a Druid, technically speaking it's most efficient from 10-19 to put talents in Balance and then respec at 20, but I'm simply not going to opt to respec then to save gold and a minor amount of time.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong that arms is viable, I'm just saying I think the difference (because the level is so low) is minor and isn't terribly important.
---
just create a few big ones to try it out. if they become popular, create more. we need constantly new servers to keep the game going anyway. 
---
by the way, i was wondering about something. i mean almost no one's gonna play on a server which is 2 years post naxx launch, right? but then what do you do with the characters? so many people say they look forward to blizzard servers because their characters will never be deleted, but they can't keep all of them stored or keep the servers up forever, that would make no sense. unless they already decided not to create new servers periodically, which would be the stupidest thing. 
---
If REDACTED servers taught me one thing, it's that just asking "hey guys, wanna do a full run?" can go a long way. Lots of people have never run that one dungeon you wanna full clear, or are up for it regardless. 
---
&gt; You can even see in that clip Esfand's weak-tea attempt to justify a higher cap: "I like the concept of having a big server, ...to me, that's more people to meet."
---
Yes, but Esfand doesn't think these things through. He's been playing on private servers so long that he's forgotten what it was actually like back in vanilla (assuming he played back then, I wouldn't know). He's stubbornly against anything that isn't like &lt;insert private server here&gt; and doesn't give a rats ass about what vanilla was actually like.
---
There is nothing "cool" about them. Only a kid would find such a thing "cool".
---
We want to get people to play with us on classic, we want new players to come into the community.
---
Gnome mage I take it. 
---
I do agree on the modern designs being very much Disney/Dreamworks style CGI. Personally, I like that style but I understand every complaint about them.
---
Looking for a NA Alliance PvE weekend raiding guild. 
---
Semi-hardcore raiding pref. I’m not looking to heb server first, nor stuck on MC forever. 
---
I’ll be playing a human mage! Just send a PM my way. 
---
&gt; I was awestruck to find a tank for SM who actually had tanked in Vanilla, and never let one single mob through to the rest of the group.
---
That's pretty much a thing about people just being BETTER nowadays. Seeing videos of popular PServers and how they run through MC/BWL with AoE and whatnot - that's also not the "true" classic experience :D
---
Attack speeds weren’t normalized until 2.0, so they shouldn’t be normalized on any vanilla pserver and shouldn’t be in classic.
---
&gt; but they can't keep all of them stored or keep the servers up forever, that would make no sense
---
They can. With how server virtualization works today you can have them up and running only if there are like 10 people on them. The servers won't use more resources than they need.
---
If I were to guess, I'd say that every 2-3 years they will launch new servers that start the 4-stage content rollout over from the beginning, sorta kinda like seasons. And at some point you may even be able to migrate your characters over to TBC realms.
---
No idea what you are talking about. You pvp, you rp, you create alts. Almost endless content. I can also see trying challenges like pve content with less characters than intended etc.
---
I don't think the problem with LFG is that it allows you to find a group more easily, I think issue is that it allows you to not interact with the other players in any meaningful way. Oh and that it teleports you to the instance for free.....
---
Yeah lets have dead servers and xrealm BG's 
---
MoP was honestly one of the better expansions imo. 
---
For an altoholic like myself who likes to level and gear up alts between raids or whatever, and WPvP on them, it was great. I got to level, gear them up via jp-hp conversion and buy decent gear from pvp vendors, and then spend time PvPing in the world (Outland EU as horde, so much carnage) instead of grinding BGs with awful players/bots. 
---
Having leveled multiple Warriors to 60, I completely agree. Until you get 5/5 flurry Fury really just doesn't give you much. 
---
My general pref is to get improved overpower as fast as possible and dump extra rage into hamstring to try adn proc overpower/deep wounds. 
---
OK, I understand your point. That's where the wish is too far away from reality though. The game will already not be like vanilla because GAMERS themselves are vastly different beasts nowadays. We KNOW WoW now. We can tank. We can kite. We can heal. We know tactics. We have cheat-sheets for about everything in this game. All of these things already infer to the classic experience. And much much more than any server population ever could.
---
What the fuck are you smoking dude 
---
I don't remember them being actually "good" compared to say a turtle or a bear type tank pet. I mostly just like the idea of a crab pet, and you'll never ever see anyone else with one. Good enough for me!
---
&gt;Depends if blizzard launch with the nerfs (normalization) of certain pets.
---
we can pretty much be 99.9% sure they will launch with the nerfs, as that happened in patch 1.9 and we are getting 1.12 classic. It's like saying "i wonder if blizzard will launch warlocks in their patch 1.1 state where they dont have death coil". Also, brokentooth (all attackspeed) was normalized in TBC, so he will be 1.0 speed regardless
---
No, night elf priest.
---
Booty Bay was a neutral AH
---
Guild Banks makes the most sense because it means the whole account sharing stuff isn't half promoted - account sharing is either against ToS or EULA can't remember whcih one.
---
I don't think that Blizzard would go out to delete the servers. Numbers will go smaller and servers might "merge" but they will survive. You know, there's gonna be this one player that's gonna go 9/9 T3 (or relevant best-in-slot) for ALL the classes that exist.
---
The more likely option (assuming that classic is gonna be a success) would be for additional Servers to pop up with further progression into TBC. There would then likely be two choices: a server where everyone starts at level one. And a server where people have the choice to transfer their classic level 60s to the new TBC Progression server (or buy a paid boost to level 60) to start out the oldschool TBC experience.
---
And the cycle continues. I mean just look at the private server community. Classic keeps on respawning. People keep on restarting. It's basically Diablo/PoE-Seasons all over again ^^
---
SFK is Cataclysm too, lol stop proving me right
---
&gt; 3% crit on 4 mages will not make up for the bad performance of the druid.
---
I generally agree, but a lot of what I'm saying is intended to provoke the idea that "bad" is all relative. Four mages and a moonkin is certainly mathematically _worse_ than five mages. Is it "bad?" I can't say. It depends on the goal of the group. A guild can find itself with a mage on its roster that sucks shit through a straw (disconnects, attention lapses, lack of preparation). Roster management is an important part of vanilla IMO.
---
In general, I think there's unanimous consent that hybrid DPS is a bad idea if you want your raid group to be competitive. But it's _probably_ not that bad if you want your raid group to be viable.
---
(It sounds like we generally agree, I just wanted to pick a small nit)
---
&gt;gaming
---
&gt;laptop
---
Pick one
---
Well so far we have seen WoW Classic beta on a 7.x engine and it looks like they are going to carry on with that based on blue posts. 
---
So brokentooth might actually end up being normalised due to that. 
---
It's all pointless speculation anyway, time will tell. 
---
If you can't force reckoning procs via /sit then pulling more than 1 mob won't be a viable strategy. You would be doubling the amount of damage you are taking for a measley 5% increase to chance to get reckoning to proc. 
---
The problem classic will likely have that vanilla never had was the decay factor of the playerbase.  Just about everyone interested in WoW classic will be playing at WoW classic launch.  If you look at sub numbers for WoW vanilla it is obvious that the same was not true.  Include all the tourists who wont even stick around for more than a dozen or two levels and it looks even worse.  So the challenge is reaching that ~2500ish players when starting with a much higher number and theorizing what the decay is going to be for the majority of players.  Hopefully things stabilize out after a while and the decay rate flattens around the 2500-4000ish players mark.
---
No you like they're cataclysm
---
don't you believe the experience is vastly different, from leveling on a server with t3 geared players to a server where everyone plays a fresh character with equal gear? world pvp will be different, 5 mans will include overgeared players all the time. 
---
Acer Nitro 5 is a good one and the price is around that range.
---
Dwarf is the supreme pve and pvp race for a priest. As long as you dont care for aesthetic :^)
---
I'm not sure. He is still working on sending everything out to the kickstarter contributors, so maybe he just hasn't gotten around to making it available yet.
---
Pretty much ANY laptop you get will be able to play wow classic ;)
---
While some stuff behind the scenes changed, we are going to get back our classic textures and your graphic card is likely gonna get bored to death by anything wow related. So pick something with enough memory (prolly 8GB) because that's gonna ensure that your system can handle the OS, Browser and game at the same time and you won't have any issues.
---
I'll take your word for it!  I don't know the guy well enough to do anything but stick to the facts (in this case, what he immediately said as a followup); lucky for me, that was plenty to make my point.
---
How is 50 a small amount of guilds? I can recall about 5 big raiding guilds from my faction in classic. Granted my server wasn't huge but still. As a result I knew people in every guild, and knew 'enemies' in all the major opposition guilds. With 50 per side, there is no chance in hell you build relationships of equal strength.
---
dwarf lady
---
While highly unlikely with how Blizzard is acting as of 2018, I'd rather they go the same route Jagex does with OSRS. 
---
This would mean having classic undertake a separate line of development; This could be creating entirely new post-Naxx content following the "vanilla" design philosophy and/or re-hash old content from other expansions to fit the design. 
---
Classic doesn't necessarily need to go to lv70 and Burning Crusade but could become something new instead. 
---
That's more so got to do with private servers being international, rather than regional.
---
For a lot of people that is a part of it, and as much as I don’t want to bring in discussions of race and familiarity into it, a lot of people discussing this here and North American and European. Chinese architecture and lore is definitely somehow foreign to us, unless you’ve looked for those things in the past. 
---
Tauren have an indigenous people/Native American vibe to their architecture, humans are traditional cobblestone towns, gnomes are steampunk to some extent, and then dwarves, night elves, and orcs all fit into their standard fantasy stylings, with trolls being kind of an interesting outlier I don’t feel like getting into.
---
All these things are familiar to western audiences, so that shift to eastern culture of a little jarring to some people. That’s perfectly fine, but saying it “doesn’t fit” is a deflection. 
---
Not wanting to sound rude, but if you can manage to save 1000 CDN for a laptop, why don't you save two or three more months, and buy something better?
---
You think this is toxic?  You need to look up the definition of that word kid
---
If the cap is 8-10k, people who want 2.5k pop can just roll on low pop realms at the realm selection screen.
---
If the cap is 2.5k on every server, this prohibits anybody who wants a 8-10k pop server from ever choosing one.
---
Truth table:
---
2.5k cap:
---
Low-pop enthusiasts satisfied: true
---
High-pop enthusiasts satisfied: false
---
8-10k cap:
---
High-pop enthusiasts satisfied: true
---
Winner: 8-10k pop cap.
---
&gt; (or buy a paid boost to level 60)
---
Do not even joke about this.
---
I think the real question is whether or not there's a number between 2500 and 10k that's optimal. I'm not saying they need to change anything at all, but i've played on some servers with around 4k, maybe 5k peak weekend times, and it was honestly pretty sweet. 
---
People like to use the 10-12k argument, but I don't think anyone really wants that. What we're discussing is more of a 2.5k vs 3.5 type of situation.
---
On my 4k ish server i recognized pretty much everyone. Knew all the guilds and all of the active players pretty much. And also i could still find groups almost any time of the day
---
Yes but we can't do much about those things. We can't go around lobotomizing players across the world. The game on the other hand can be controlled and in my opinion it should be as close as humanly possible to the original product.
---
I mean for example they could easily remove the debuff limit now because it's not a limitation anymore but they won't since it was part of the game. Ion talked about this during Blizzcon. They wanted it gone in 2005 but couldn't because of limitations, for Classic they are intentionally putting it back in even if they don't have to, just to keep things authentic. 
---
To be fair dumbing down and welfare epics were a very common line of criticism at the time and rightly so. Enough so that Blizzard reportedly increased dungeon difficulty first thing when Cata released.
---
I still can't really wrap my head around so many Classic players looking up to WOLTK and to a lesser extent even TBC. It was clear back then they rested on antithetical design principles and the level of outrage against over simplifcation was not unlike what we see today.
---
I understand why someone would prefer WOLTK to vanilla, but I don't get how someone could be more or less into all 3 but then dislike later xpacs and retail like much of the sub is.
---
It's true.  Although I remember on a p-server when running SM... "Wow, we didn't wipe once."
---
That's kinda why I push for the 'original' dungeons with their original pulls -- not the 1.12 nurfed-to-hell versions.  Everyone thinks Vanilla was so easy, then let's bring it back in ALL of it's wonderful glory, when Rag couldn't be beaten until he had several nurfs (after a God-awful number of attempts), when Jandice and her adds would wipe and wipe and wipe a Scholo group; when repops would occur and you had to re-clear the dungeon area again -- and where your chops were created in knowing your class.
---
Hey guys. NA here.   
---
  
---
Looking for a good RP-PvP guild that plans on being massive and raiding (not super hardcore).   (Horde mostly likely)
---
Preferably 2days/week raiding, 3 hours a night, 7-11ish EST.    
---
Looking for memes and good jokes, people who can pass the time really well.
---
personally will be rolling priest or shaman for raid healing. Alt will be a feral for tanking/dps.   
---
Going to duo level with my friend who's a warrior, he will play both tank/dps.  
---
Contact me here or discord - muufokfok
---
Same story for me expect with project1999 Everquest. I *love* the game, but the most frustrating aspects of the game (quest system in particular) makes me want to give classic WoW a shot at recapturing the same feeling without the frustration.
---
Games that require you to be patient, dedicated, and social are good things (as handholding is just bad for a game). However, this doesn’t excuse poor game design that hasn’t been optimized for a users experience.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE NORMIES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I'm sure he's thought it through, but he's stuck in a bit of cognitive dissonance. He wants to advocate for hardline #nochanges, but he also wants this change.
---
Good luck with bag space
---
i guess server merges was the answer i was looking for. i like the idea that your maxed out 60 character can eternally be transferred on a fresh bc server. you obviously couldn't transfer it to a fresh vanilla server, due to overpowered gear. 
---
they would, in most cases, still rot around unused, but if i guess it doesn't matter if server merges are implemented efficiently and the data isn't too big to store. 
---
What were your guys lowest level when you did your first full clear?
---
Thanks again for all your help! I'll deal with the aesthetic... and the smell...
---
There's absolutely nothing wrong with not liking vanilla they way it was and wanting to change things like you propose, but I think things like that are better suited for private fun servers and not the official product.
---
There are a lot of changes that can be made that certain people will find objectively better, but where does it stop and is it even the same game anymore?
---
The community was the single most important thing about vanilla and quadrupling the server sizes changes that in a massive way. 
---
We jokingly call STV Vietnam on my pserv because youre dead all the time lol 
---
Hmm was 55-ish. Maybe 54 or 56 I dont remember. It's been like 13 years or more?
---
Go smoke a jay or something and just calm down 
---
Yes, I agree that the same design principles that made Vanilla more accessible than previous MMOs also led to BfA. This doesn't mean more convenience is always bad, it just means that past a certain point it stops adding to the experience and starts taking away from it. That point was reached long ago for retail.
---
That's why they are using sharding. They can create 4 shards of every server with 2500 players each essentially overloading the server. After a few weeks when the tourists leave they can turn off sharding and we're left with a healthy 2500 population cap in place. 
---
I love moments like this while leveling in vanilla
---
This is one of the best books ever made, as an owner I highly suggest everyone consider a copy for their collection
---
Only to some extent. For example the biggest vanilla pserver has peak at 15:00 server time at about 9,5-10,5k while it drops down to 5-6k at 04:00-06:am. 
---
Having a server with 4k peak would mean you have maybe half, probably even less than that on a nonbusy time when most people are at work. 
---
MoP was great in that they let you boost characters and dropped a new class. My hunter "main" only lasted about 6 months, I've been a MW ever since.
---
Yes he's #somechanges :p
---
Thats one thing missing from retail WoW: Etiquette
---
Dude, Google first, always. This has been asked and answered a million times. There are whole guides written. 
---
Wow! what an original flame. Ofcourse its toxic, it reaks of spoiled brat gamer who demands anything. Maybe you should leave these forums for a bit you seem totally obscessed tbh considering your post history. Also fyi Im close to my 40s. No that I gotta proove myself to you or anything.
---
I think I was in the wrong using rushing for vanilla regardless how effective a player levels. Sure takes its time. For whatever its worth I hope Vanilla just becomes a success or perfect imperfect!
---
Pandaren predate the movie, but of course it had influence, especially with the monk class.
---
And what exactly is wrong with that? WoW has always payed homage and had major influence from mainstream media (I remember Lario and Muigi from Un'goro back in Vanilla), and this race had passion in it and attention to detail.
---
But hey... OMG PANDAZ, BLIZZ IZ NUTS!!!
---
What the hell is a jay? If it's a drug it would make sense because the undead race attracts all the lowlifes that populate our planet.
---
this sub is getting more trash with the days.  
---
Also more trolls...
---
I feel like the point in 2h axe/maces will be a bit wasted. It's going to be hard to find one with the stats you want, and if you really just want to use a 2h you can use staves without costing you a talent point and likely with better stats. Second of all in my experience (leveling a shaman on a private server) caster shamans reaaally want to stay out of melee range with certain classes as much a possible. Having a shield really helps offset the lack of armor if you find yourself wearing random cloth items for stats.
---
I bet you make the same arguments when someone calls Star Wars Clone Wars a little kids show. 
---
It's more the idea of the monk. The Light I can deal with. demonic and arcane magic -fine, that's part of the trope. But....kung fu beer?  
---
I mean, if the modern world has taught us anything, it's that Kung Fu is a crock of shit.   
---
And healing/fighting with beer? Ok, maybe their temple is one large AA meeting with a brewhouse in the back?  
---
Personally I'd rather have seen them give us the Everquest style Bard. 
---
The reason they are not going away with debuff limits is BALANCE - not gameplay. There's a huge, huuuge difference in this. It's a completely different category than player numbers :)
---
Oh I'm fairly certain that if TBC servers come out that this is going to become an option. Not a joke, simple Activision reality :D
---
Guild rivalries was one of the greatest things in vanilla. This is also something that gets kinda lost on big servers so there are so many active guilds.
---
I was referring to prior to purchase, you know when you first hear of the product you get an "initial impression."
---
50 isn't huge if you check wowprogress on literally any server. There's hundreds of guilds but only 10-20 who really do well. Classic is gonna be just the same. You'll have numerous smaller guilds who do nothing but 5 mans. Then you'll have several one going for the 20p Raids and some who go for all the content. 
---
What I was trying to say is that with 50ish guilds you'll recall names. You WILL build a community. It's not as big a number as to forget everything and making everyone an anonymous.
---
Deep Wounds and Impale are pretty useless when you have a 3.5% base crit (think that's what warriors have). The 5 points in Cruelty make those two talents worth it. If you do fast track straight down arms (it's not a bad idea for the long run), I would suggest getting improve Overpower before Deep Wounds and Impale just so those two talents are actually doing something.
---
&gt;implying laptops wont be able to run wow classic
---
&gt;implying that just because it cant run top tier games its not considered “gaming”
---
Gtfo here toxic fuck
---
Hear me out, I'ma get real crazy here..
---
We could have low, medium and high cap servers, and people can chose to play on one that suits them. I like high cap servers (~5-7k) and would rather play on one, despite the difficulties it brings in some areas, it massively improves life in the areas that are important to me, like having people online for random groups at all times, rather than a few hours a day.
---
I really enjoy what you're creating here. The idea of a platform for routes is great!
---
I do have two questions, first can you create on option to enable the tooltip addon from ClassicDB? https://classicdb.ch/?tooltips. This'll make the tool even more complete without needing to add more data to the route files.
---
The other question is somewhat more of a conceptual idea. While loading external files is a nice feature to use for other routes isn't it a great idea to have a (community filled) repository of routes that you can use? Somewhat like how for example Puppet (server management software) has Puppet Forge or like Docker (also server software) has their Docker Hub?
---
That way people will be able to share their created routes easily and other users won't have to keep track of the external route files they would be using.
---
My laptop is only a couple of years old and runs BFA starting zones at 20-30fps with all settings on lowest, in its native resolution of 1366 x 768. WOW classic will likely provide the option to revert back to lower polygon models which will increase FPS but I'm likely going to build a new system. And fuck playing on a 11.6" screen hahaha. Last time I built a system was 13 years ago as a teenager. It's funny that a 13 year old game is forcing my hand. I've no intention of playing with the old graphics. I'll be pushing everything high as it can handle while enjoying a screen 4 times the size of this junk. 
---
I'd say pretty much any laptop with a dedicated graphics card. It's asking a lot for integrated ones to handle. Even with whatever scaling options Blizzard will provide.  
---
gonna be the worst of both worlds lol, 10k+ pop limits and sharding combined
---
Aren’t people like this that play the current crap of a game going to be just a delight to play along side in classic just because they can with the same subscription 
---
Yes and no. Both have huge impacts on the game experience.
---
The point is, they're putting it back in even if they don't want to, because that's what the game was.
---
You can't start changing things you don't like because it changes the entire product. It's like when George Lucas went back and re-edited the original Star Wars trilogy, I don't think he had any right to do that. It would be like Leonardo Davinci coming back in 2018 and start making alterations to the Mona Lisa, it would ruin the painting forever. 
---
As crass as it was, lmao. Dude.
---
&gt; the difference is that pandas were the first race with the new "disney"-like character design and animations
---
Absolutely not, gnomes, goblins furbolgs at the very least always looked very cartoony, at least not "rugged" (lol) in the slightest. 
---
In wc3 blademasters speak in a steriotypical japanese accent and peons say "me not that kind of orc." Warcraft has always been silly.
---
[NA-Central] Horde *RP-PvP(or PvP) name to be determined. *Not super into RP.
---
Hello everyone. My brother and I have been playing wow since the summer of 2005. We have experience on retail as well as private servers. Our idea of fun is using teamwork to dominate world pvp and breeze through raids.
---
This guild will be focused primarily on world pvp during the first few months with weekly raids on alliance cities and hotspots. Since most players will want to focus on leveling, Wednesday nights will be reserved for organized pvp. Although chances are on any given night, you will find people to pvp with. A certain well known server released information that stated it took the average player around 250 hours to reach level 60. That's roughly between 3-4 months playing around 15-20 hours per week which we believe is the sweet spot for people like us. We have jobs, families, and respect things like exercise and not pooping into socks. If that sounds like you, you're one of us.
---
Once we have enough of a core group to start raiding Wednesday's will be raid nights as well as either Tuesday's or Thursday's depending on popularity.
---
Loot will be distributed based on a contribution point system for non set pieces, and loot council for set pieces. Loot council will be elected each season by the members of each role(healer, melee[+hunters], and ranged). This allows players that are capable of contributing the most to the guild to see the most return while also avoiding loot council corruption. 
---
If anyone is interested let me know. The discord is up and bot is running, guild documents are just about done, however most of our recruitment will be done in game. 
---
Yeah dungeon finder goes far, far beyond removing the need to fight the interface. 
---
You can go find spoiled brat games in retail wow.
---
Have a good day sir

[warhammer 40K inspired mmo](https://highlatencylife.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/gemminie_icon.png)
---
Nah, curved on third week into the raid, with pugs, ww monk (ez to get into groups as a carrier)
---
Source for the joke claim? 
---
&gt; It was boring for me, sure, but i totally understand why they did that. It was a good raid but only like 5% of the playerbase ever set foot in it during vanilla.
---
I think it's 4%, and that was of the playerbase at that time. The slow progression system of vanilla and the slow increase of players over time meant that even if you were a "full-time" raider many players simply didn't get to that point by the time the expansion hit (which by the way was a few months later than originally planned). With a few exceptions the vast majority of players that got to clear Naxx were those who started raiding back in late 2004/early 2005 and continued that slow progression throughout the vanilla period. And the stress of raiding broke a lot of guilds and individual players over the course of vanilla. Add to that the fact that by the time of WotLK over half the playerbase were players who started after the release of patch 1.1. In june 2006 WoW had 6.6 million subscribers. By the launch of WotLK that number was 11.5 million. That's at least 5 million players that realistically never experienced original Naxx. And that's assuming lineair growth. Going by the slowed down growth in TBC and stagnation in WotLK you can realistically say that the influx of new players was much larger than the overall growth due to older players quitting. I estimated about anywhere between 1 to 4 million replacement players.
---
So by the time WotLK launched the number of people who had experienced original Naxx were closer to 1%  That's just over a hundred thousand people on an active playerbase of 11.5 million.
---
I get the criticism against re-releasing Naxx, especially with the only alternatives being EoE, OS and VoA all single-encounter raids,  but it's a simple fact that the vast majority of players had not yet experienced Naxx. Plus re-using an already designed raid gave Blizzard the freedom of resources to focus on their next raid, which happened to become one of the best designed raids in the history of WoW.
---
Do they create different servers for all the other changes to the game people want too or can we maybe just get the original game the way it was like we were supposed to?
---
I was against #nochanges initially because I thought surely improvements could be made. Later I realized that this is about getting something back that had been lost in time.
---
We have no right to changes, neither does the developers. Nobody does. 
---
&gt;  It doesn't change the fact that Classic was intentionally designed with a ~2500 cap in mind.
---
Is that a fact? Or was that just the number that the realm servers could handle?
---
I'm a bit sceptical with all claims that "X was designed in WoW Classic" when we have so much evidence that most of it was just made up as they were going, or completely changed after the beta. 
---
&gt; Do they create different servers for all the other changes to the game people want too or can we maybe just get the original game the way it was like we were supposed to?
---
If your argument is purely slippery slope then you have no real argument. pop cap is a single variable and offers choice. How terrible, people getting to play in an environment that suits them, how awful!
---
In early patches each faction only had "one" AH, Orgrimmar and Ironforge. In later patches each capital got thier own AH hub but they still linked faction wide, so Stormwind AH and Darnassus AH was linked, Orgrimmar or Booty Bay is not to these. So in essences late patches had 3 AH pools Alliance, Hord, and Goblin with every AH point in those pools linked.
---
My problem with vanilla AH is that it was a real pain in the ass to use. it is laggy, bad with searches, it sorts in a completely unintuitive way, the list goes on. TBC made pretty big improvements to the AH interface and later expansions made further progress towards a much better UI. I so no reason what so ever to bring back the stupid AH interface from original wow when they have made so many improvements to it.
---
To be clear I don't want every AH in the world to be linked just the WAY better UI to be used.
---
Instead of just standing around waiting for the zep in Orgrimmar, I always make it a habit to unequip my weapon and punch some boars and raptors to death. It's the little things that help.
---
They've used some inspirations from all kinds of cultures over the world. 
---
I don't see why exactly using the chinese stereotypes is supposed to be the one that's not ok. 
---
Did you watch the video or did you just jump into the conversation? Mark Kern said that it was a design decision. 
---
I'm not too familiar with Priests, but I love seeing the talent theory crafting that Classic wow offered.
---
what about friends, significant others, reading, going outside, school, exercising, eating healthy, enjoying other hobbies?
---
you've been given a short amount of time on this beautiful place called earth and if you spend all of it in azeroth you've goofed my dude 
---
they dont loook at all like the warcraft 3 panadas
---
[NA Alliance] I'm not looking for a guild per se but a group of community minded players to start on a server with. I'll be playing with friends/family and we have a range of casual and hardcore players, a strong and positive server community is something we are all hoping for! I'm going to be selecting the server for my friends/family (we all intend to play together) so if anyone is on a similar mission send me a DM!
---
That same argument could be made for the inclusion of groupfinder, because after all the people who don't want it could just not use it.
---
No groupfinder:
---
Groupfinder enthusiasts satisfied: False
---
No-groupfinder enthusiasts satisfied: True
---
Groupfinder:
---
Groupfinder enthusiasts satisfied: True
---
Non-groupfinder enthusiasts satisfied: True
---
Winner: Groupfinder.
---
No the argument isn't slippery slope. The argument is that we shouldn't change a classic product just because we don't like certain aspects of it. We don't have the right to in my opinion.
---
There are a lot of things that frustrate me about vanilla but I don't want them changed because that changes the game. 
---
The Draenei had a massive retcon with TBC. Nothing new.
---
it's in the OPs link. Original vanilla WoW developer confirms it was a pure design decision, not a technical issue. 
---
Completely agree. I wasn't a huge fan of MOP, especially at the time, because it did feel so different. Looking back, I wish I were more open minded
---
Level with a boar.
---
At 60, tame a winter spring cat for PvP, keep the boar for PvE, and tame a LBRS Wolf for raids and dungeons.
---
Someone really needs to make a compilation of the "Biggest Brain" suggestions like this one.
---
so 2.5k would be like 4k but even more community driven
---
Bears are a solid pick, but boars have charge for instant aggro. Bears have more health, but less armor than boars, and boars also eat everything.
---
Personally, I recommend the boar.
---
Having played both vanilla on a high pop server, and current massive population private servers...
---
The community on pservers is nothing at all like the community in vanilla.
---
Since you plan on PvE exclusively I wouldn’t dismiss Troll at all.
---
*Berserker racial is sick good for the attack speed and on par with Orc racial
---
*Troll health regen racial great for minimising levelling downtime inbetween mobs
---
It bugged me in the AH when you expanded armor types and go into miscellaneous, it will still have options for head, shoulder, chest, wrist, etc... when the only miscellaneous slots were ring, neck and trinket. Also when you sort by price, it'll sort by bid price and not buyout price. 
---
Wow has pretty much always been cpu limited as opposed to gpu limited. The problem there is laptop cpus tend to prioritise efficiency over power so you could run into some issues. 
---
I'm running an alienware 17 r4 with a gtx 1070, the screen is 1080p @ 60hz so no point rendering in 4k (which i do on retail just to stretch the legs a little on the gpu because bored is the right word) or over 60fps so i keep vsync enabled. I was on a pserver last night and while running around SW fps was dropping below 60 quite often. The gpu is barely being utilised but the laptop cpu (i7-6700HQ) is a laptop processor so is a bit less capable than my overclocked i5-2500k desktop set up from 2011. 
---
Having said that, the newer processors feature some monster performance compared to mine so a system sporting an i7-8750H should be more than fine and as it has ryzen graphics you shouldn't need a discreet gpu. This last bit is pure speculation on my part though.
---
Wildstar is indeed a very good example of what happens if you try cater only or maybe just primarily to the hardcore audience. 
---
Already got an owl to level with.
---
I like them much much better than boars.
---
Thanks for the recommendation regarding the cat and wolf, though :)
---
Gnomes and goblins were used that way, like the comic relief. But it needs to be the exception to have its effect.
---
About Furbolg, I never found their animations nor any of their themes to be cartoon. They don't have exaggerated expressions or movements, even in Bfa. 
---
I liked the aestethics of the zones. Minus the insect areas with the trees, those were uggo. 
---
And the pandas were cute. I just think they shouldn't have based an expansion on pandas.
---
I think all expansions after wotlk were too grand in scope. They should've just gone for small updates and stopped expansions completely and expanded on the already existing world with care. 
---
It's true that on high-pop, blizz-like servers quest groups form and disband as quickly and impersonally as on retail but IMO
---
1) That is a result of what MMO culture has become, people are used to retail
---
2) On these servers English was not the first language of most people, and some people like Russians or Chinese didn't speak English at all, so there was less communication
---
What makes dungeon runs impersonal IMO is:
---
1) The systematic meta grinding and content skipping of nearly every dungeon due to 14 years of vanilla min-maxing
---
2) Loot reserving and general greed, perhaps partly derived from retail expectations of loot
---
I meant big as in successful rather than size, loads of small guilds around! My friends guild managed half of MC and that was about it. 
---
Forgot to mention, there were around 100 people in SW near the AH  during the fps drop.
---
If it moves into BC, we'll have a LOT of alts.  So having mains on a couple servers will help.
---
I got the impression that you disagree with them, and threw a link to mock them.
---
Anyway, it's a bit rude to link a 197 minute video without describing the relevance (like "Here's Mark Kern, one of the lead designers talking about it"–instead of "look at these idiots avoiding the issue"). You literally made a case *against* watching the video.
---
player numbers impacts Balance across the board, farming spots get overloaded, bottlenecks form all over the world, PVP happens constantly with too many players in zones. 
---
Too many players are out there so forming friendships becomes less of an importance when you can find another groupmember quicker.
---
Who the fuck puts a TLDR on a 27 word post.
---
watch what the lead game designer said lmaoo
---
I don't think you're being fair with Esfand here. In the clip you linked he did say that he personally likes the higher pop caps, but also said that he knows that for a lot of people that is not fun, that it can be overwhelming and you don't see the same face twice often. Didn't seem stubborn at all to me. 
---
So warriors were very common in classic, and seem very popular on Pservers, however, despite the abundance of warriors I think if you asked anyone who played back then, how many of them were good you'd get a low number as an answer. Maybe it will be better this time around, but I doubt it.
---
Group finder is starting to look really good! :p
---
&gt; 5 big raiding guilds
---
Well I did say it was at the 40 minute mark. I'll reformulate. 
---
Time to chill down with the ''no rights'' crusade. The experience will be grand regardless of your take on the matter. I remember having low, medium and high pop servers back in the day. Mini story time:
---
I chose a medium server, because you know, medium is chill. 
---
About half a year later, the server pop went from medium to low.
---
Guess what? No paid server change meant stuck on a ''dead'' server.
---
There's no way I want that again; not after all that work it takes to get a char to 60. 
---
**If it were up to me, I'd say 5k to 7.5k is a healthy pop.**
---
On the other hand, if you finally manage to get one, you're pretty unique and are bound to get /w  'how did you get that owl?' on which you can gleefully respond 'by dying 1523 times'...
---
And it gives you something to do early Classic release when every single  quest mob is contested by 10 players or more.
---
&gt;Plus re-using an already designed raid gave Blizzard the freedom of resources to focus on their next raid, which happened to become one of the best designed raids in the history of WoW.
---
This is true, but it was the first real negative in WoW history. Before that point they did not put a foot wrong. TBC is nearly universally loved, vanilla where it all started. There was a couple of people grumbling about welfare epics in TBC but that only truely kicked off in WoLK.
---
I'm currently leveling a prot paladin on a private server (for the second time) in preparation for Classic and I've successfully tanked every instance in the game.
---
Prot is as fast as ret for leveling, but it requires that you know how manage your mana with SoW. You can compensate for the longer time/kill with little to no downtime and being able to fight groups of 4-5 mobs at a time, and you are also able to solo quests that usually require a group to do.
---
I disagree with the majority opinion that Paladins shouldn't tank in dungeons. I would actually go as far as to argue that a Paladin with mana potions is superior to any other tank outside of raid environments, given that you know your spec and its limitations. The main advantage is that you are able to generate incredible amounts of AoE threat, which synergizes very well with frost mages and warlocks, being able to fight 2 or 3 packs of monsters at a time. While leveling, the main problem is that you need to spend a lot of mana to maintain aggro if you have high group DPS. This can be migitated by simply asking for a few seconds in every pull to generate threat, and having a stack of mana pots to use max rank consecration if you drop aggro or pull multiple packs per fight.  It is however more gear dependent than druid and warriors and benefits greatly from consumables (frost/shadow oil is great). 
---
I wouldn't recommend leveling as prot unless you know what you are doing though, since it can be frustrating to deal little direct damage (sit-stacking reckoning will most likely not work in Classic).
---
low pop is cool until u get merged or if ur ppop goes up for whatever reason then it sucks.....which is open to happen during the first month or so of the game. do I want to re-roll the first month of game time ? lol nobody does
---
Lucky you, I cannot manage to get any fully isolated time. Being on the computer is something, but not wanting to answer comments or chatting at the same time is inconceivable for my gf. 
---
Playing something cannot mean being unavailable for her. 
---
I would guess it is because she does not know anything that is engaging and virtual. It's very alien for many people I suppose. 
---
PLEASE NOTE, THE POST BELOW CONTAINS PERSONAL OPINIONS, AND THAT DATA IS QUITE FRANKLY TRASH
---
Let me start by saying that I agree with you that high population servers are more interesting, so that we're not in strong contention with each other.
---
But I think the population cap needs to be approached differently. I'm starting with the assumption that what you're quoting with your population cap example is private servers, since that's roughly the number ND leveled out at after a month or so.
---
I don't believe you can make a meaningful comparison between private server populations and Classic WoW populations, and the reason is demographics.
---
On private servers, you host several different international communities. EU, NA, China, Russia, and a small population of Oceanic players. This causes a very unusual population cycle.
---
For example, I live in the midwest in North America. According to one private server census website which I won't disclose because they are no longer doing granular census, the peak for the day was around 10,000 players. This occurred at 10AM CST which I think is 5PM server time but don't quote me on that. 10AM is a very odd time for population to be peaking for a WoW player. The lowest population was 3000 to 4000 and this occurred at 2AM to 3AM CST roughly, which is actually a sensible time for population to calm down for any region, but of course this was only true of the NA regions.
---
So lets take the 10,000 cap that's being proposed and translate it to a single region in Classic WoW. I'm more familiar with the US so I will use that as my example.
---
According to recent census data on ND, there are roughly 16,000 total players on that realm, and the most number of players I saw at peak times at 10AM on the weekend was 10,000, which means that roughly 62% of the population was online all at once at peak times.
---
What we need to figure out first is not how large the population cap should be, but rather how many people in game is tolerable at the highest peak of the day.
---
With that said, here are some numbers:
---
Total - Peak
---
11000 - 6820
---
10000 - 6200
---
9000 - 5580
---
8000 - 4960
---
7000 - 4340
---
6000 - 3720
---
5000 - 3100
---
4000 - 2480
---
3000 - 1860
---
2000 - 1240
---
1000 - 620
---
Of course this is extremely rough data, and it's probably not all accurate, but it's how I conclude what population cap I would personally like to see on a realm that is restricted to a single region.
---
In my case, and of my own personal opinion, the population I would like to see is one of the following numbers:
---
Of course if my estimation that peak population = 62% of total population is wrong, then we can just eliminate the total population cap from the displayed results, because ultimately the population peak is the most important number. With that said again, I'd prefer a population peak, which in most regions is at about 10PM according to this study, of between 4,500 and 5,000 players.
---
The most interesting thing is that my calculation still arrives at the lower end of your proposal for population cap.
---
I just think the community is considering the population in a limited view so I wanted to express that here.
---
Even with equal gear, Paladins and Druids can tank endgame dungeons without raiding gear. The only difference is that Druid and Paladin tanking gear is more difficult to get cause there not many options, but very specific items. I mean while warrior can have 4-5 options for a pre-raid tanking head, Paladins and Druids have only 1.
---
Perhaps. I find him to be a bit hypocritical, ignoring certain parts of #nochanges because he doesn't agree with them while still claiming to be #nochanges.
---
For me viable is in the range of 80% of optimal so if a hybrid clas does 80% of the damage of an optimal dps it is viable. This includes any and all dps that the character helps others to do given that it is the only spec that can provide it. Ofcourse I am talking about theoretical max, in any given raid situation I'd say go whit whatever you want it is a game and ment to be fun
---
Boars also have charge which is very useful for leveling. It gives the pet a big threat spike at the beginning so you can drop your burst and not worry about pulling aggro
---
&gt; private fun servers
---
This is how you can tell when someone is not trying to express an honest opinion, and instead just wanted to find a way to jab at their opponent.  
---
thats not what sharding means to blizzard mate.
---
Sharding would be ok you have 1000 people in zone one - that pool of 1000 is divided into 4 groups of 250ish.
---
What your talking about is having four server bubbles under one server.
---
UI=/=Chat system and talking to players
---
I think there is a fine line between recreating the original experience and keeping players subbed that a lot of people here don't want to acknowledge.  If the game is intentionally broken for the sake of the original experience, good luck convincing 40 people to go into MC or AQ40 knowing that no matter how perfectly they play, they won't be able to clear it.
---
Well, I really do think that we don't have the right to change it. It's almost black and white, either everything is up for change or nothing is.
---
During vanilla Blizzard often offered free server transfers off high pop realms to low pop ones because of large queues and server instabilities and a lot of people took it. My guild was one of them and it was one of the best decisions we ever made. But that's anecdotal and not really relevant.
---
Yeah Duskwood is one of my favorite leveling zones. It’s so creepy and dark. I remember being quite startled when Stitches attacked Darkshire, as I had never seen an abomination before. I also loved Raven Hill Cemetery, and did a bunch of quests and grinding there. Mor’Ladim was the bane of my existence. I swear the second you turn your back to anything there, he will charge straight for you and murder you. 
---
Yes I know, I'm just trying to simplify it because when you try to explain how it really works you tend to lose people.
---
5 points in shadow focus is definetely an overkill for PvP with 5% hitcap. 
---
Not sure if shadow weaving is generally worth it in this spec, because just as you said - your shadow damage is not that great and I doubt that you ever realistically manage to apply enough stacks to make it count, and putting 5 points for a little bit of dispel resist utility is not a great deal either. Vampiric embrace is fine, but it's generally a tool which fits a shadowform priest the best, since it  maxes out the shadow damage to get the most profit from this ability and find a workaround for "no holy spells" in shadow form.
---
You do not have such restrictions though, and investing into Spiritual Healing looks seems like an overall better choice to me. So I'd personally go for something like Spiritual Healing/Silence based spec.
---
I wonder why Blizzard isn't doing these podcast instead of a bunch of "influensers".
---
The extremely blizzlike pserver I play on has 1.5k-2k concurrent users.
---
People use this to shit on the server saying it's "low pop" but to me this is one of the biggest draws.
---
My understanding of the sharding is that it is lower level areas for a temporary amount of time. Basically, just until the population spreads out a bit. You can't have 2500-4k people at launch in the starting zone fighting for mobs, it just wont work. I'm sure the population will dwindle once people realize what vanilla wow is and move on. But its not as if 1 server is divided 4 ways and then they come together after a few weeks. Its more like zones are split X amount of ways to allow for a reasonable amount of questing and other players. You could theoretically then go to a major city and find every player since that zone is not sharded.
---
LFG =/= LFD. LFG is a window you can post advertisements for groups in. People the whisper you to join. It is functionally no different than tradechat Spam. 
---
Groupfinder is a crossrealm tool which puts those who refuse to use it at a significant disadvantage. Vanilla realms are isolated.
---
Fixed:
---
**Groupfinder:**
---
Non-groupfinder enthusiasts satisfied: **FALSE**
---
I've always played on RP servers during Vanilla.
---
RP is absolutely not a full time thing.
---
Most of the time, you do quests, ask for groups to clear dungeons, talk about loot, etc. Just like the normal game.
---
The only difference is you might have people wearing certain hats just for the sake of it, people travelling just for fun, people telling stories, people giving out gifts and making little shows...
---
It's just like a PvP or PvE server but with a lot more "playing around."
---
Best April fools joke ever
---
It's like smartphones making us more social. Yes it's easier to communicate with friends and family, but do we actually have more genuine social interaction because of smartphones?
---
LFG, etc, was a mistake for this reason. The "inconvenience" is a part of what makes the world genuine and decisions impactful.
---
Interesting spec, although I would offer a couple small adjustments.
---
1. 5/5 Shadow Focus is a waste. You're going to be hit-capped in PVP at 2/5 I believe. May as well move those 3 points into Spirit Tap* for a little bonus Spirit every now and then. May synergize well with Spiritual Guidance, worth testing. 
---
*-Checking the verbiage it only says that it procs off experience kills, but IIRC it also procs from honor kills.
---
2. If you are having any issues with taking spell damage, maybe shift 2 points from Holy Specialization and/or 3 points from Shadow Weaving into Spell Warding. 
---
And silence, though.
---
One would hope. I seriously suspect they won't release RP PvP which would be an absolute tragedy.
---
Linus tech tips reviewed a laptop from Walmart and oddly enough he actually recommended it. that was 799 cad and kicked some ass. Should try to see if you can Google it.
---
Unbreakable Will is incredibly strong in PVP, then Martyrdom is much more powerful than Healing Focus. I would try to shift some points to those talents and give it a try!
---
That will probably be the case. Very few people actually remember what the server communties was like back in 2005, either because they were too young or didn't play enough or serious enough for it to stick with them.
---
I had over 100 days plays in my first year. That's on average 8 hours /played every day for a year straight. I remember and the community aspect was indeed amazing. It's something we began to lose as early as TBC and by the time Wrath rolled around it was definitely noticeable. 
---
I've played on private servers and they haven't been able to recapture that due to a number of factors but the megaserver nature is definitely the main one. 
---
It feels like retail a lot of the times. Anonymous, no down time, everyone is replaceable. 
---
When was this said? Do you have a source for your claim?
---
I've read and watched every single sentence and minute of official Classic WoW content and have seen nothing of the sort claimed for Classic WoW.
---
You might have fun eating your crusty boogers. That's irrelevant.
---
The fact is it was the worst zone in Vanilla, and the devs intentionally put the least content there to discourage players from spending time there.
---
Easiest, no nonsense route is a slow 2h and go arms. Now some like to go fury because it has 5% crit and piercing howl. Arms provides more utility and between Imp Overpower and Deep Wounds you can joust mobs better and probably kill harder targets (joist=slow the mob and run out between weapon swings). 
---
I'm pretty confident in saying after getting many wars to 60, 2h arms is more controlled and better than fury unless you have 1handers mich better than your 2h and make use of /sit, and are post 35-40 (need entage+flurry). I've leveled pure fury and nothings wrong with it, but it takes above average leveling gear to beat a 2h, deep wounds, imp OP, and jousting. 
---
They touched my pee pee.
---
Lol every comment is contradicting the previous one... AKA play what you will have fun with and don’t worry about numbers and math too much
---
I main a rogue and we all wear the defias facemask just for fun (no stats) so I suppose I've already been doing a bit of RP. As has anyone who's ever used transmog.
---
&gt; As players, we show our selfishness when we demand population caps based on our own comfort rather than the good of the realm.
---
That's a very good way to end a post.
---
Actually no, if you played in vanilla you'd know it was the number they ended up on because that was the most they could get out of the servers because of stability issues.
---
Thinking about spawn rates. High population drives the cost of certain things up significantly. Looking at elemental fire during MC progression. There is a maximum number of spawns per day if you kill mobs that drop these immediately. When you have 10k+ server with what would normally be a capped server 24/7 during regional peak hours you can never really farm effectively. This drives the time investment up for regular players. You can't farm a weeks worth of fire protection potions in 20min anymore. With high pop completing with mobs it would take an hour or more. 
---
Looking at black lotus there simply wasn't enough spawns to service the need of the community in the way that real vanilla had. 
---
&lt;Rewind&gt; is looking for members!
---
We are a NA alliance guild who plan to play on a pvp server and we're founded by a group of about 5 irl friends in our mid-late 20s. We are looking forward to our second iteration in classic WoW! We understand that most people who played classic don't have the time to devote to no-lifing anymore, and most of us are parents who work full time, so we want to host a friendly environment for the part-time players of classic WoW.
---
We won't be rushing our way to 60 and we won't be the first to clear end game content, but we do plan on at least seeing naxx content at some point. We just want to enjoy the experience with other like minded players. If this sounds like something you might be interested in, PM me for a discord link!
---
(We've got our own discord bot that I've been building as well. For now it handles role management but in the future it will have DKP functionality as well as other features!)
---
If X then Y is the definition of slippery slope.
---
Yes sharding is a lot more complicated than I make it out to be and is made on a zone basis not realm basis. 
---
The important thing is what they will use it for, overpopulating the servers for a short period of time until the population dies off. It would be the same as launching with 10k and dynamic respawns and then going down to 2500 without dynamic respawns, but that change would be very noticeable to players. "Where did all the people go!?"
---
You're free to call it what you want. Let's leave it at that.
---
wow is like from 2005 a potato could run it
---
lololololololololololoolol
---
I'd blame your parents for letting a young kid use the Internet without supervision
---
&gt; Before that point they did not put a foot wrong. TBC is nearly universally loved, vanilla where it all started.
---
I'm not sure about today, but back then there was a lot of things a lot of people hated about TBC. After all, this is the expansion that introduced both flying and *daily quests*.
---
Around tbc wrath the bigger realms were capped around 3-4K.
---
That's true I'm just not really sure what the best solution would be.
---
Nost had 12-16k at all times and that was too high, so 8-10k seemed like a good compromise. 5k would be fine with me too.
---
I just think some people who never played on these private servers have misconceptions of what the pop numbers mean.
---
You're making a few assumptions:
---
1. They will not advance to TBC
---
2. There will not be new servers (which the continued existence of private servers suggest will still work)
---
3. That players will get bored after Naxx launch
---
Well-put!
---
Thanks for the nice vid, I desperately need videos like these to help with the wait for classic.
---
Keep it up!
---
I love both shadow and healing in PvP but in PuG BGs while shadow I found I was usually one of the only healers so I would find myself out of Shadowform for most of the fight to be able to help my team, so I would like to try out a spec like this. Shadowform is huge but it's nothing if you're never in it, and it's not as good if you have to pay all that mana to pop back in there to increase your damage for just a bit before you pop back out again
---
But also starting to look a bit more desolate. I'd easily prefer 4k on a PvP server atleast.
---
Or you could just listen to the clip.
---
Any of the things you want to bring would make me quit the game and go play a 1.12 private server.
---
You're right, bears are slower. The sound though. Who can take hours and hours of boar squeals? 
---
Hi, /u/DuggerX
---
Achievements did far worse than create imaginary content.  They completely ruined player identity.
---
In Vanilla and TBC, you had people who were "the mount guy" or "the pet guy" or whatever they were.  Some people liked to explore, others liked other parts of the game.  Achievements turned everyone into the "achievement point" guy.  
---
Nobody cared that you had cool pets or a cool mount, because everyone had those pets or those mounts.  People were only jealous if you got a 1% drop because that meant you were closer on the achievement than they were.
---
In offhand section you don't have [Spirit of Aquementas](http://classicdb.ch/?item=11904) listed and [Eye of Paleth](http://classicdb.ch/?item=2943) is reward from an Alliance only quest.
---
I'm not sure which is worse - how toxic you are, or your spelling and grammar.
---
I know you're laughing, but I've seen many many threads in the WoW forums of people complaining about how ERP goes unchecked (nobody is ever banned) in what basically is a PEGI 12 game, and they are simply right.
---
Don't need to I actually played during vanilla and they were tweaking pop caps constantly for stability reasons not some brilliant game design reason.
---
Unless you really want the Rake model, it’s easier to get a starving mountain lion at lvl 24 in Hillsbrad, same attack speed
---
Blizzard used to have heart. Their creations from WoW vanilla and prior were always full of funny lines and references to pop culture, especially of the pre-internet days. 
---
Now its just on a growing list of connections to my past that arn't the same today
---
It is forgiven.
---
Alright then. You're of course free to provide your own narrative but don't expect it to have any relevance to the discussion when it directly contradict the facts.
---
Added into slide show, thought i had this on as it was on my previous slide show but must've removed it like a dingus! haha good spot my dude!
---
Spirit Tap definitely works off honor, just like warlock soul shard generation and that one rogue talent
---
Sorry, I don't think this has anything (or if it does, it's a stretch) to do with Classic WoW (Rule #1). So, this post has been removed.
---
I mean, I'd rather play MoP instead of BfA while waiting for Classic.
---
Sweeping Strikes alone will make 30-40 significantly easier.
---
yes thats the joke
---
There's 3 arenas where you want to look at - PvE, PvP, and solo.
---
In solo:
---
* A Carrion Bird, Owl, or Bat is going to be a very good option, because of the Screech ability to generate AoE threat on multiple mobs.  This can usually hold against the occasional Mend Pet or Multi-Shot (but to spam them you still need to tab-target pet-attack).
---
* Turtles have Shell Shield, which can be useful for bigger elites.
---
* Boars are useful for Charge early on.
---
In PvE:
---
* Wind Serpents have a ranged attack, and can stay out of danger
---
* Wolves give the melee group a buff (Lupos is a great option) and you can keep them with you to give Furious Howl without them being in danger
---
* After that, I believe Cats are the best for DPS (but don't quote me on that)
---
In PvP:
---
* Boars are great for the charge
---
* Cats are great to keep ranged interrupted
---
* Scorpids can poison folks which makes it harder for your stings to be dispelled
---
Personally, I'm going to go Boar to level to 34, Carrion Bird for my solo pet after that, get a Wind Serpent at 60, and use my other slot to pick up all the pet abilities before getting a Cat or Scorpid (undecided).
---
Main Hand.
---
BGs in Vanilla were not cross server. No idea what they will do in Classic regarding this.
---
This.
---
So many people are focused on whats optimal when a lot of what was fun about vanilla was finding out what was the most entertaining and the most optimal by experience!
---
I think I will roll either a night elf rogue (or warrior) or a dwarf shaman (healer) once Classic launches. 
---
I'm going to say I am worried about a sequel, but that's because TBC and WotLK were my favorite times in WoW, even more than Classic.
---
I don't want 1.13.  I want TBC and WotLK.
---
We do have a single-player Warcraft RPG.  It's called Battle For Azeroth.
---
I know they are completely right. That kind of ERP that Goldshire has is sickening, and even more sick that Blizzard lets it happen.
---
Not even the *actual* roleplayers wants to be associated with them. Sadly, they are.
---
The overall scale of the “feel” of games has grown so much since 2004 though. We are conditioned to expect more/bigger today than we were back then.
---
I’ve played on private servers with 2500 players and they felt dead tbh. I think people are going to be disappointed when they see what 2500 population actually feels like.
---
Classic, TBC, and WotLK yes.
---
OSRS? No.  Community content?  No.
---
Psst.... hey dude .... they aint got no dwarf shamans in classic 
---
You can't have good comments in a bad thread.
---
Why hence should they use multiple words whence minimal words are acceptable.
---
TLDR - why use many word when few words do trick
---
I was with you up until "resets and wipes everyone."
---
Leave those serves (maybe merge them) but start fresh servers without forcing players to start over if they don't want to.
---
Also happens to share some Pre-Raid Bis gear with pallies!
---
Remember when you couldn’t delete a pandaren because of mail and there were no mailboxes around until like level 10?
---
MoP had a too bright of a color scheme. It didn't fit into the drab, darker colors of the previous expansions. 
---
Thing is, we can debate til the end of time whether TBC or Wrath was the better expansion, but they are both loved by a very significant population.
---
Compare with the population who would want Cata or MoP, it's a lot less.  WoD practically no one, and Legion may get a few more because it honestly was the best WoW's been in years.
---
But the point is I think TBC and Wrath are both good and we should get both.
---
I want Classic to succeed so we can get TBC.
---
Ah okay. I thought you were implying I am lying lol
---
I think most of the TBC/Wrath players want Classic to succeed so we can move on.
---
I'm not going to push for it until Classic succeeds, though.
---
Vendoring is a kind of use.
---
There is no good class and bad class.  Every class has its role to fill.

---
There are no RP-PVP servers on retail WoW.
---
[newegg.com](https://newegg.com)
---
This is where I go for all of my computers. You should have no issue getting a computer that can play wow Classic for that much. Just stay away from anything labeled "gaming computer". I am sure you can get a lot more help from one of the "build a pc" subreddits. 
---
More of the issue is the stuff broken because of the population. You can't quest solo in any real capacity because of tagging rules, so you have to group. But you aren't grouping because the quest is hard, or you need their help to get to the mobs to kill, you are doing it because without it you won't tag things. When this is the case why talk, everyone knows what you are doing so you group, get the kills and move on. 
---
The other issue is that the game with that level of overpopulation is fundamentally broken. It is at the same time harder than vanilla was and vastly easier. It is much easier because everything is dead all the time. There is no real effort avoiding mobs, or carefully pulling things because everything worth killing is already dead. That is the hard part, getting a tag on a thing you have to kill for a quest or finding somewhere to farm is really tough for the same reason, everything is dead.
---
The dungeons are a mix of a go go go mentality that seems less a matter of retail bleeding over and more people who have played so many private servers that the dungeons are a chore to get the gear they want for "Real" content and a lack of caring about reputation because there are so many people that you will always have people to group with no matter how much of a shitbag you are.
---
Indeed, Pala Bis coming this Friday :)
---
My plan isn't as indepth but is basically something like pop out 20 or so pushups, situps/whatever every time I gain a bar of EXP. The first few levels will be fun. 20 count is reasonable for when you're in dungeons and don't want to inconvenience everyone, although I suppose you could also save them for the end.
---
It would be in my opinion. Classic WoW changed a lot over the years it ran beyond releasing end game content. Starting the game with more quests, easily available good quality gear, easy class quests, more dungeons, summoning stones, better dungeon itemization, 5-man instance caps, buffed gear and remade (generally buffed) class balance cheapens the overall experience in my opinion. 
---
At that point they might as well just enable achivements, tabs, dungeon finder and allow people to buy High Warlord gear with honor. 
---
Dire Maul and Maraudon are great examples. They make the game way easier, provide more powerful and more balanced gear and smooth out the game curve without really being particularly difficult. 
---
Having more spellpower/AP/Hit gear available easier and earlier will be another huge boon. Many skills and talents and general game functions were remade as the game progressed, with the exception of a few obvious "problems" like windfury proccing itself or oneshotting Kazzak with Ret Paladins, these were basically universal buffs. 
---
Tier 0.5 set quests being available at launch will be another huge boost. 
---
Not to even mention how much easier raiding will be with things like buff material reworks, ZG free loot and reworked itemization. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it is certainly a terrible idea. But the thought of someone playing their first MC raid with a buffed warlock, improved mechanics and better "free" gear with reworked stats and thinking they experienced the original game just strikes me as depressing. 
---
Because this is about leveling efficiently.
---
Not at all. To believe you were lying would be ridiculous because this is such a well known issue and it's so open too.
---
For your consideration, the spec I used when I was doing pvp on a private server.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMushbZbhxZVMGdcd
---
Offered a lot of utility. I found myself early on losing to mages (silence is mandatory in the private server metagame) and being unable to survive any sort of focus until I tried this build. Mindflay with grenade stuns or blackout procs let you kite people really well. Sometimes the best form of damage mitigation is to just kill someone!
---
Funny, MoP leveling killed retail wow for me. I unsubbed during mid cata, and on a whim I made a trial account one and a half later, mid MoP. There were no challenge, mobs were barely meant any threat, dungeon run felt like a bad joke for 5 men... you could probably do it with 2-3ppl.
---
The whole game felt like I'm playing hello kitty online instead of warcraft...
---
I had less of an issue with the architecture and more of an issue with the retarded stereotypes, like all Pandaren love Jade dragons, jade serpents, cranes, tigers, etc. Every NPC doled out fortune cookie wisdom.
---
The whole thing felt silly, lazy, and cheap. Zone design was great, though.
---
Because there is no need to spend more than that on a laptop?
---
In which case ret will be the best for +movement speed, +crit chance, +dmg proc off crit 
---
But Chen's Empty Keg
---
My build gives you movement speed and I already explained why +crit chance is less DPS than Precision + Slow two-hander + Reckoning. 
---
The +dmg proc off crit is more often than not a complete waste of a proc, whereas Reckoning is never wasted.
---
Good shout. Because the vanilla quest interface doesn't attach relevant quest-items to the log like the modern game does, very simple use-quests have a tendency to become annoying. A friend suggested the same thing early on, but I kind of spaced out and forgot about it since I didn't want to deal with the item database/icon stuff at the time, but that Rest API completely covers it. I'll start working on it right away!

Since everything in the app runs locally there's no real security threats. Whether the custom route-file exists locally or externally somewhere on the internet makes no difference. People who have requested an import feature usually want to keep their route-file private which I honestly find a little silly, but at the same time I do know from first hand experience how time-consumbing it is to actually write. After reading up on the programs you mentioned I think I get the general gist and it sounds like something that would be cool to learn. I'll look into what alternatives there are and how to mold it into a format that works for this. Thanks!
---
uh sir, you are just supposed to select a color , no free thinking! 
---
I am not sure that's how they are doing it. The way I understand them they are planning on sharding the first zones (Not sure if that means just the under level 5 zones or the 5-10 as well) for the first few weeks to make a smooth launch. If they overpopulate then as soon as you hit either durotar or the barrens (Depending on where the shard ends) you will land there with everyone. If they make it 10K (Example number) then you will have the first unsharded zones become the end of most people playing. It would be so overloaded that you can't do anything, and would turn off anyone who isn't interested in basically a blizzard official nost (The idiots who are all no changes except they want 12k pop caps).
---
Sharding the whole world until the pop settles (If you are right about their plans) is dangerous in itself. Some realms will work out the right way and in a few weeks you just take the sharding away and things are good at 2500 people. Other servers might have 7500 players much of the time (Big servers generally get packed for reasons I don't really understand) and now you can either remove the sharding and implement queues for anyone over 2500 (Long ass queues and likely piss off a lot of people.) or you have to dump those people on some other server somehow.
---
Yes, an active subscription to world of warcraft will be all that is necessary to access classic wow.  Can confirm at the bottom of:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
Yes it is from 2005, but thankfully the client isn't. 
---
To me the story telling peaked in Wrath. After that, I really didn’t give any care to the other villains. I thought Deathwing was a cool throwback but killing him didn’t have the same weight. 
---
&gt;The +dmg proc off crit is more often than not a complete waste of a proc
---
you keep saying that but it is not true.
---
vengeance lasts for 8 seconds, so it' really only a waste if it procs on your last or second last swing. It probably takes about 10 swings to kill a mob so by those numbers there's an 80% chance it is not 'wasted'. Also it's not difficult to move the mob as your killing it so you can be ready to pull the next mob as soon as it's dead or on the last swing. 
---
In TBC it was a quality of life change to remove attunements so highlvl raids didnt have better access to recruit and allow lesser raid to do easier bosses in TK SSC or BT if they couldnt kill the respective endbosses of the previous raid. Also sunwell badge vendors.
---
     
---
Starting in WotlK it became a concious design choice to keep players up to date.
---
It's a common theme throughout wows lifecycle that a problem of one expansion gets fixed and said fix translates into fundamental system design. 
---
Or at least if they do make changes, only do minor things or optional graphics settings that do not affect anything else. Implementing major changes like doubling the population cap, which greatly changes the experience and requires additional changes across the game to function, is very far removed from the objective of creating an authentic Vanilla experience.
---
Blizzard does not want to support different versions of the same game. Without other changes to fix the massive problems that are created by overpopulation those higher pop servers would be completely broken. So now you want higher pop, and to do that you need changes in mob spawning and profession nodes at the least. 
---
Also, you have to find a good way to explain to people who are coming in fresh or haven't played since vanilla that these servers are not the game they are looking for, and are a modified version. Otherwise you have people jump in, realize how miserable the experience is, and quit not because the game is bad, but because they were playing a modded version they weren't ready for. 
---
It wasn't as efficient or as effective while leveling when I went full Ret as opposed to Ret + Reckoning, especially in highly contested zones.
---
I was running classic Pserver on my parents computer. I did that so my bro &amp; I could play when he was in town or something. It's a shitty Lenovo touchscreen desktop computer with no dedicated graphics, 4gigs of ram, i3 processor. 
---
You have a hard time grasping what a "fact" is. Everyone's definition of fun is subjective - you see it all the time in "list your five favorite zones" topics - the first 25 replies have 20 different zones listed.
---
I thought about that. Kinda like Path of Exile and their new leagues x standard league, right?
---
What else would you call modified vanilla? Either you want vanilla or you don't. I understand some people like the overpopulated servers, but don't try to act as if that is anything near blizzlike.
---
Really thinking about it as a Feral/Resto. But Herbalism and Alch is also juicy.
---
Agreed that private servers were a unique thing in that we all played on French time and the pop remaining constant through the day was due to people in various time zones logging on at their local peak times.
---
If we have a Pacific US Classic server a cap of 5k will look like 5k at peak hours and maybe 500 around 3 AM.
---
Agreed that there is a subjective element and my opinion is a result of playing in vanilla and also on Nost-type servers, but it is difficult to accurately determine what will be best with Classic. I just feel 8-10k is a compromise down from the 16k of Nost and people who want 2.5k would be able to choose low pop anyway.
---
Also if one gets stuck in on a realm which happens to become popular it feels much better to log on immediately rather than sitting in a 1 hour queue or repeating the 1-60 grind over again on another lower pop realm where the same thing could happen.
---
Hi, late to the party but I’m the video creator. A lot of people seem to be missing the most important part of the vid at 5:30 where I explain how dodging effects casual players and **actually** kills the PvP scene
---
I don't believe you have any authority to tell anyone how they should spend their free time. Neither do I. All I'm saying is that overworking yourself to the point where you only have an hour of free time is ludicrous and not good for your health 
---
There was no mafias in actual vanilla, it is an entirely recent pserver phenomenon 
---
&gt; With that being said, Blizzard should not strive to satisfy both low-cap and high-cap groups when they set a population cap. They should strive to satisfy the conditions of good game immersion, balanced game economy, and balanced in-game real estate opportunity at peak population times.
---
This is exactly right, but it defies the rest of your post. This number was set at the beginning, at around 2500 players concurrent. There is no reason to revisit it, as the game was designed around this number. The spawns, nodes and immersion are all set up for that number or less in the world at one time and doubling that seems reckless at best.
---
The only thing I truly know is that I do NOT want 2.5k caps. That's way too low in my opinion.  
---
Give up on Blizzlike. No private server provided Blizzlike. Blizzard isn't even providing Blizzlike. Nobody will give you Blizzlike.  
---
Give up on it.  
---
So double the normal vanilla cap is the lowest you are looking for? You are correct, people who played on those servers (Me) have a good idea of how the population cap being higher affects the game (Negatively). The game at 5k is broken because of overpopulation, it just gets worse from there to the point of basically unplayable unless you are instance farming and staying out of the world as much as you can.
---
because it takes a lot of time and it would turn into more of a Q&amp;A - blizzard would be accused of avoid X question or Y question.
---
It's easier to let the community do what they like and monitor it rather than spending the resources to produce a podcast.
---
The rest of my post was an opinion. I said it myself at the end that player opinions regarding population are selfish. I was being selfish.  
---
Mop was the only good Expac
---
This would be hilarious if it was posted on a private server subreddit, but alas its here on a subreddit populated by retail-babies. They arent funny, they willingly spend money like mindless sheep on a game that isnt good anymore, and their stupid opinions are probably what caused the game to become so bad in the first place, with their constant whining on blizzard forums. Nerf this! Buff that! Add this! Remove this! now everything is the same no class can be distinguished from another. Fucking babies!
---
Here's to the worst xpac ever created *raises glass to mop*
---
Yeah, lots of new things coming up
---
Great videos btw. I agree a debuff would be the simplest fix to this issue. 
---
&gt;if server merges are implemented efficiently and the data isn't too big to store. 
---
This is a non-issue, character data is very miniscule. Very talking like a few megabytes per character max.
---
1v1? You lose to the mage 100% of the time and lose to freezing and frost traps against the hunter unless you get the jump and blow them up
---
Player numbers are the first and most important balancing mechanism. It keeps the world from being stuffed full of people. Keeps things from constantly being dead, lets you quest or farm and actually have things to do. All of those servers that have more players on them have to adopt other changes to try to fix the problems. Dynamic spawns, changes to the nodes spawn rates and locations, changing instances because of economy problems. We don't want changes, we don't want modded vanilla. Classic is a recreation of vanilla wow as close as they can get it, why would we need all these changes?
---
Stormwind memories.
---
Agreed. All things considered with the pros/cons of 16k Nost and the pros/cons of 2.5k vanilla what would be the best compromise?
---
The original 2.5k could automatically prevent issues with the epic hunter quest, devilsaur mafia, rare spawns, quest zone overpopulation, which could prevent the need for sharding or dynamic respawns, at the very least making the devs' lives easier. But IMO it would be much more fun with a bustling world of 5k.
---
That website tho, hnng.
---
Bro just RP all the time
---
Yesterday I RP'd a dwarven ethnic holy/crusade Raid against the Dark Iron dwarves in Wetlands, Spun it as a holy crusade, only took priests and Paladins. We had a blast
---
That was a war crime. But alliance are the good guys. Pandaria had better writting than bfa. Cof cof
---
Yup, it was a technical limitation but they knew that in advance and designed the game around it. Just because they couldn't fit more people in and might have wanted to does not change the fact that the game was designed around that many people in the world and no more. 
---
This is how fake news spreads, read title and post opinion/share.
---
Overall I don't think we need to compromise at all. The game was designed for 2500, let it be 2500. I understand that some people like a higher pop, but unfortunately there is no way to achieve it without putting out the people who want vanilla as it was. The higher pops require changes, and I am against changing things just for the sake of stuffing a few more people in the world.
---
Some guilds create a new chat channel specifically for in-character chat, leaving guildchat for traditional guild discussions (or the inverse, chat channel for out-of-character). Others just have you wrap your out-of-character chats in parenthesis or brackets. And that's generally pretty true for /s as well, although you should really keep that down to a minimum. There aren't really any hard rules for any other forms of chat though. 
---
I still remember seeing a tiered out Rogue in Gadgetzan saying that will be my character someday. It was always a great moment seeing or running into players from the best guilds.
---
Wether or not it was a design decision or technical limitation is beyons irrelevent. That is how the game was during the vanilla period and it heavily influenced how gameplay and community was driven. 
---
Even if it HAD been a technical limitation, things were still balanced and tuned against it. If you use that crazy 10k pop, you HAVE to modify spawn timers. 
---
Even that won't fix it, though. There are only so many farming spots, and those will be far more saturated with people regardless of the spawn time. You will also be ganked by far more bored 60s than vanilla retail. And people won't be able to self police and blacklist as well as they could in vanilla retail. And you won't have as many rivalries or people you see all the time. 
---
10k population sucks. It is such a gigantic change, but so many people are willing to do it. I'd say it has a WAY bigger impact than loot trading or sharing beginner zones. I don't want those, either, but I'd take them over 10k active population 
---
I'm not sure why /u/Grievuuz was upset that I pointed out they were talking about PvP when OP explicitly stated they are only interested in PvE. It's like I am the bad guy for pointing out an irrelevant comment!
---
Why would I give up on getting what they are promising? Moving further away from vanilla for no reason except that you would rather a pirate server experience than the real thing is not something we should do. They are trying to provide vanilla as it was the best they can, that should include core pieces like the same population it was built for.
---
I always hung out in Undercity and as it was not as popular as Orgrimmar it almost always felt like I had it all to myself.
---
Arms with 5 points in fury crit % sounds insane as hell.
---
I got this yesterday on a server who's name shall not be named
---
Looks &gt; Stats.
---
That's why you need to Raid at least until BWL. The rest if optional.
---
Anything Between 2.5k - 4k is fine by me, anything above 4k shit starts to fall apart very quickly, and names becomes blurred.
---
Keep in mind that 4k is server max cap, that could also mean there are 50k active accounts on that server -- assuming an even split, 25k horde or alliance players is a lot of names to know. 
---
Fortunately, unlike massive private servers, servers are regional where if you log real late at night or mid day during working hours, you'll see a lot fewer players which would be a good times to avoid pvp and grind / resource collect -- something that doesn't exist in private server land.
---
UC has always been my fav capital.
---
It’s always empty.
---
Gaming laptops aren't really a meme anymore though, especially not since the 10 series Nvidia GPUs released.
---
&gt; WOW classic will likely provide the option to revert back to lower polygon models which will increase FPS
---
From what we know now, only the old models will be available.
---
loot trading, sharding
---
Your math is for 100% of characters being (1) independently owned (not alts) and (2) online at the same time. That seems like a stretch.
---
Putting more points into shadow focus actually has some benefits in PvP as it helps overcome resist talents. For example priests have 15% chance to resist fears and silences with just 5 points in Disc, but having extra spell hit beyond the normal cap partially counteracts that. Similarly holy paladins often have 10% fear resist chance.
---
I'll just hop in my delorean and know how populations will be in the future. Oh, and screw rolling on the servers people I know might play on. 
---
Is that a legit website??
---
If they want to play themselves they won't tell anyone their name or realm. They won't get tags like on live and if they group they share the loot /drop chances. It doesn't benefit them if people steal their kills. 
---
Yeah the idea of drunken idiot who shrugs off damage by being so intoxicated is a massively popular trope. Plus if you're ever bored, do yourself a favor and watch Jackie Chan's "Drunken Master" - it's a really funny slapstick Kung Fu comedy and one of the origins of the trope (as well as the Brewmaster's silly fighting stance).
---
What is this? What reveal? Can someone explain
---
I'm not sure if something in the demo is hard evidence of anything, given the state it was in.
---
Having said that, Focus Target was in keybindings back in wrath of the lich king, so i don't think it was added post-7.3 client.  If anything, I would take its absence in the demo as *weak* evidence it will be omitted in classic.
---
I remember turning the music off and the ambience on max to hear the spooky arthas sound files
---
So you think they just won't stream classic because it would be impossible?
---
&gt; an i7-8750H should be more than fine and as it has ryzen graphics you shouldn't need a discreet gpu
---
The i7-8750H doesn't have Ryzen graphics, it uses Intel UHD 630 integrated graphics. You might be thinking of [Kaby Lake G chips](https://ark.intel.com/products/codename/136847/Kaby-Lake-G).
---
No they'll stream. They'll just hide their name and realm, at least until they get a zone or so ahead of the mass that would follow them. 
---
I played a Female Orc Rogue. It's the best combo there is and everyone who says differently has stupid ears.
---
Well I was in a pretty hardcore Raid back then and at least Pre-Naxx, we Rogues dominated the DPS meters.
---
I disagree that salvation is good for Rogues. You make more consistent damage over time with S'n'D. Salvation is in my opinion better for Warriors. If they crit, they can easily die, even with the buff active.
---
You as a Rogue, you just Vanish say: CYA. That Cooldown isn't that long and remember, the people who Tank also get enough Rage and Aggro from Windfury proccs. If all fails, just Evade and pray.
---
I don't see the point of Salvation for Rogues, never felt like I needed it. What you really need are sweet Winfury proccs and a Swords.
---
yeah, they might have a warping effect on populations. it just is what it is in 2019.
---
should make for some entertaining pvp situations, at least.
---
There were some annoying things about Nost's population, such as the dynamic view distance solution where you only see people around 40 yards around you in main cities to reduce lag. That was kind of immersion-breaking. Overall I thought the high pop was invigorating and fun, like you're part of something huge.
---
I can see how 12-16k has issues, so 5k for example would still be fun for the same reasons. It just seems unusual that high-pop enthusiasts are willing to compromise but low-pop people require exactly 2.5k? Maybe they're not thinking about sitting in 2 hour queues?
---
Some (or maybe all, haven't looked) of the text from your slideshow is lifted word-for-word from the [Egregious guide](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-shaman-guide/). I know you cite the guide in your notes at the end, but if you're going to lift slides/paragraphs whole-cloth you should probably use quotes and direct citations on the pages.
---
I would say no, for one people could also use it to troll them and do the opposite. Secondly even though the world will physically be smaller it will feel huge again because of how slow people travel and more zones overall will be relevant. People often forget how huge the world use to feel when you had to take long flight paths or travel on foot. Plus it will also be easy to avoid spots they stream at. The last thing would be that it will depend on the number of servers, if you know one has more streamers you can choose to play on another one.

 Why should we make things worse? Your arguments are really tired, I'm sorry you would rather play a pirate server hosted by blizz, the rest of us will just lobby for and enjoy vanilla.
---
and what about letting them hit you in the back? auto crit or just auto daze?
---
I may well be thank you. This is useful info, I've just been tasked with speccing a laptop for the other half to game with and I've picked that bit of info up from somewhere but I'm thankful I have yet to male a purchase on the back of it. 
---
Since WoW uses yard can we ban this bot?
---
Second sentence of your link:
---
&gt; While much of this material was later adapted into lore in later sources (The Frozen Throne, Warcraft RPG, etc.)
---
Most important example being Chen's not so small role in the Founding of Durotar campaign. The time of Pandaren being a "joke" was over way before WoW even launched. 
---
Imagine not thinking Thunder Bluff isn’t the fucking tightest shit you’ve ever seen in your entire life.
---
Picture the scene, you’re a young Tauren, hunting and fighting in the verdant rolling hills of Milford when, either by or by chance” you approach the huge elevator on the south side of Thunder Bluff. You cautiously approach and ride to the top, only to see a bustling hub of shopkeepers, merchants, class trainers, and NPC’s all conducting their business on top of a giant set of cliffs. You take the giant rope bridge to an ajoining Mesa and find even more people and things to do. Eventually you come to see a non-descript hut that contains none other than the venerable Cairne Bloodhoof, leader of the Taurens. He and all of the other elders greet you as one of their own before your journeys take you elsewhere. All the while never forgetting the unspoiled land you grew up in and have sworn to protect.
---
Other races can’t even compete.
---
The agility scaling was insane! I remember level 5 twinks having like 50%+ chance to dodge 
---
Blizzard's idea of Classic has loot trading and sharding.  
---
So let me go back to what I said before:  
---
Give up on Blizzlike.  
---
Furbolgs definitely look cartoony. And I even only took the 3 most obvious examples. Tauren also look cartoony, albeit to a lesser extent than the 3 most obvious choices. Same goes for orcs and trolls (just look at them compared to orcs and trolls in other fantasy works like LOTR). 
---
Warcraft as a whole has always been a very cartoony looking universe. 
---
True, I guess it will mostly be a problem at launch then.
---
Back in 2004 I decided my class based on the tier sets I liked the most on that old website. Boy was I young and stupid. I read about every class and tried to learn while I was downloading. Then made the terrible mistake of deciding I liked the Dreadnaught set the best. I didn’t even get a single piece of Tier until 2007. :(
---
I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but goddamn I hope focus is in Classic.  
---
I know it's not a vanilla feature, but I count focus as being one of the best things they added to the game. I absolutely love the feature.  
---
It’s too early to say until we have at least a beta I would think.
---
For now I would assume it won’t be in 
---
I have a set of 15lb weights I use during death timers in whatever game I play, going to need to figure out how to incorporate that into classic. 
---
It's either that, or watch as some guilds steamroll through MC the first two weeks and then the server loses players who can't keep up.  
---
It wouldn't be so bad for those players to actually see and feel how hard those dungeons were to earn those blue items before they roll through MC knowing the strats with tanks in green gear, soulstones, and those pesky 'tricks of the trade' to insure a win.
---
Deviate bruh
---
Welp shit, I'm rolling druid now. May the Earthmother watch over us all.
---
getting hit in the back just means you cannot dodge, block, or parry
---
I got fucking lost like ten times. And wiped a bunch. Never made it past the Lyceum. Probably like 4 hours total before calling it quits, and only a few bosses.

worldofwarcraft.com through web.archive.org I would imagine

The text was a copy and paste 
---
I didn’t clam it as my own, just thought it would be useful in helping people pick armour pieces and knowing what they need from their gear. 
---
But I see what you mean 
---
When I can I’ll add a link on the page too 
---
I loved seeing people's gear, it was so rewarding changing your look over time. I seem to be in a minority but I loved the warrior t2 look. I HATE the retail appearance and they recycle so much gear. But you can't tell if someone is wearing shit or not by just looking at them.
---
Ohh, thought they restored a classic version of the website. Got me worked up.
---
Well what's the old saying? Opinions are like assholes everybodys got them. That being said, I never felt like the old servers were dead, and if we're accepting changes then I want world buffs removed , boss health buffed and debuff limit removed.
---
There's a thousand QoL things that should be in Classic, but with enough qq from the same people we won't have them.
---
I've even heard some people say that the Classic client should have the stupidly limited Lua API of the 1.12 client. 
---
Does anyone else just have trouble stomaching clicking a link to a video with a thumbnail of grown men looking like this 
---
I am REALLY hoping that classic in general or at least my server has a healthy raid PUG environment, up until BWL  I have some alts that I want to gear up and im fine waiting until Naxx is out to get them into MC / BWL for just the tier looks alone... 
---
I plan on going for server first Warrior when classic comes out. Make sure you plan out your weapons. For instance, if you are horde, it is very important that you get the cauldron stirrer from the quest where you run to Thunderbluff as soon as humanly possible (I think like level 12 or 13). Then at level 18 you should get the serpent staff from the Wailing Cavern quest chain. That should take you all the way to 30 for your Whirlwind Axe. As a side note, make sure you have a hunter friend that can farm elemental charms for you as well as group with you for the troll tusks. Also have a priest friend to heal the group when you kill cyclonian. A level 35ish hunter, 30 priest, and 30 warrior should be able to kill Cyclonian easily (he can be hamstring kited).
---
I think your math is wrong. The 5k cap refers to 5k people online AT THE SAME TIME. Not alts or total characters. Most people aren’t multi boxing. So I think his analysis is correct. 
---
Don't dual wield, that's the biggest thing. You will miss way too much, and you won't have the hit rating to compensate. I played WoW heavily from vanilla through WOTLK, and leveled a warrior to 60 on a private server last year. I found the Arms tree to have much better talents early on, so that's my recommendation.
---
&gt;this is the expansion that introduced both flying and daily quests.
---
These were loved when first added, easier money and easy of getting around. It was only later that the negative impact was really understood.
---
Being able to mail more than 1 item at a time.
---
Also quit in Cata, trying to resist the urge for now.
---
My friends and I would occasionally challenge each other to make the best level 10 twinks, and duel in Goldshire to find the winner. We typically went paladins, and the gear was similar to what this guy showed, with the enchants. Fun stuff!
---
If WoW Classic is a success, we will almost certainly get either a progression server or standalone TBC and then WotLK servers.  
---
If it makes financial sense and keeps people subbed, it will happen.
---
i'm not the expert re: paladin reckoning if it's any different, but as far as enrage is concerned - 
---
'crits' from sitting down are not considered crits for the purposes of proccing enrage.  this was a private server bug that this occurred - and any guide telling you to level as fury for the purpose of using a /sit macro is based on this bug and should be disregarded.  the EXCEPTION to this on retail vanilla (which may or may not have been a bug itself - doesnt matter) was SPECIAL ATTACKS against you by OTHER PLAYERS would still proc enrage.
---
so, for example, if you were to /duel a rogue and /sit after each hit, their auto attack crits would not proc enrage, but their sinister strike crits would.  
---
full disclaimer: this may or may not still be a case of mistaking DOUBLE DAMAGE HITS (which you receive from /sit'ing and do not proc enrage) with ACTUAL CRITS (which dont deal double damage during /sit).  it is hard to find or parse actual, non-anecdotal data to any degree of certainty at this point.  people would stack reckoning by dueling other players, irrespective of using /sit.
---
tl;dr: i wouldnt expect /sit to work.  stacking reck with duels should still be a thing irrelevant of this bug, though.
---
How was the 1.12 API limited?  
---
The thing people always ignore when saying that Dwarf is the only choice for alliance priest is that then you are playing a dwarf and not everyone wants to look at them. If you don’t like your characters animations and aesthetics than you will get bored. 
---
Also tell your tanks to learn to stance dance. I played alliance during vanilla and we cleared all the way through KT and we had 1 dwarf priest. So only 1 fear break, it’s perfectly doable without dwarf priest. 
---
All gear is hunter gear!
---
&gt; I want world buffs removed , boss health buffed and debuff limit removed.  
---
Agree on all of these.  
---
Right. My play-style in WOTLK was very in out, bleed, reset. In out, etc. 
---
Is that a thing in vanilla?
---
Will look!
---
Ur right mythic raiding is prob harder, but guess what, mythic raiding is not rewarding at all.
---
In vanilla, theirs one raid tier, no heroic, not plus, no flex, no lfr, not mythic. You wanna raid? its simply one raid. Items don't roll in strange scales from 1-10 versions of themselves, and the fights mechanics don't have 4 versions
---
Sure mythic raiding might be hard - harder than vanilla raiding, but guess what, you don't need to do it. You can do lfr, or normal, or heroic. ANd by the time you've done those 4 modes, show me one person who is excited to actually do the mythic version, for a 5th time. NO one is. and why would you want to? do the same thing a 5th time with slightly harder ARBITRARY increases to difficulty?
---
Lets take an example of a real life challenge with Retail wow's difficulties, tell me which one you would rather do
---
100-Meter Dash
---
LFR - 100 Meter Dash, except the floor a conveyer belt moving forward and you get a popsicle at the end
---
Normal - 100 Meter Dash, Except you you have to wear a pair of shoes that is one size too big and your mom is in the crowd making a scene
---
Heroic - 100 Meter Dash, Except you have to wear a pair of shoes that is one size to big, and it's actually 110 Meters instead of 100, and you're shoe laces are untied
---
Mythic - 100 Meter Dash, except you are wearning no shoes, Blind folded, you have to hold your hands above your head the whole time, and say the alpha bet backwards as you are running, randomly the people in the crowd throw bottles of water at you, you could potentially step on trap which will trip you, and at the finish line, it's a brick wall, so you have to slow down to avoid killing yourself
---
In case you didn't understand the point, Adding arbitrary Crap ontop of things doesn't make them funner or more valuable or even worth doing, it makes them tedious, and when you've already done the raid 4 times its hard to give a shit, especially when the loot rewards are a different color and multiplied by 1.2
---
The music is about the only thing, and that’s about the only thing that hasn’t changed much at all since TBC and Wrath. Hopefully that never changes, really, because those lads do damn good work.
---
Gotta skip their servers then.
---
As an EU player I thankfully don't have to deal with this.
---
One of the funniest things I witnessed in the pserver community was the guild Brack Rotus, symbolizing the relegation of Lotus farming to, you know... farmers.
---
Limited in the sense that it didn't include as many functions and events as the older clients had.
---
For example, when someone casts a spell, there's no way of knowing the rank and duration of the spell they're casting. If they stop casting (cancel) the spell, there's no way of knowing that. That's why castbar addons suck so much in vanilla. This extends to every aspect of the game.
---
Yeah with any recent Intel or AMD Laptop should handle classic fine. Their integrated chips have gotten pretty damn good. For WoW at least, even more so Classic. 
---
Raiding is what really pulled me into the game. Being apart of my guild's raid team was so much fun and rewarding. I had no idea how to tank, and they brought me in, helped me out. We had a lot of fun and became really good as a unit. It made our raid progressing much smoother, which made completing the tier sets a little easier. Such a great sense of accomplishment getting that last piece.
---
Retail Raiding: Uldir (N) - "It's been awesome pug so far everyone! We are at G'huun and no wipes. Everyone is doing great! Lets fini......wait? why did they leave? wait? why is everyone leaving? We are on the last boss, and we've only been in here over an hour?"
---
Reply: "This fight sucks and he drops crap gear. Might as well do LFR. Easier. See ya."
---
True story. Happened Saturday night. Sad.
---
pointless to hide that, people will find out quickly anyway
---
That's it exactly.  I do appreciate that he went through a little work to show his math, even if the basis for it was wrong.
---
I had no real basis for my 20% estimate for capital cities/instances, though.  For all I know, the real percentage could be higher - but, then, as the community collectively trends towards 60, the relevant high-level content areas get that much more crowded.
---
We just want vanilla. Nothing more nothing less.
---
WOTLK is a bit too easy and dumbed down
---
Big reveal? Did I miss something? Are we getting classic news soon?
---
I feel like there is much disagreements about that because there is not really a distinction between "cartoony" as the visual/texture side of a cartoon and the "cartoony" with over-the-top animations.
---
Warcraft was always stylized, meaning the graphic styles of all games never tried to achieve realism (on that we all agree I think). But animations can do a great deal.
---
When we look at the Tauren comparison (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q65c2pY6P9U), it's easy to see. We could totally use the same model and textures, and by changing the animations reducing what is called "cartoony".
---
When the WC3 Reforged team said they wanted stylized but not cartoony like WoW for their game, I think that's what they meant.
---
I can imagine an actual cartoon not being "cartoony", that way. The exaggeration of expressions is IMO the most defining part of the genre, not the model, the textures or the art itself.
---
Hi, /u/MentalConcentrate21
---
oh! my mistake then! thanks for clarifying!
---
It's removed (commented out) from the demo client. Doubt they'll add it.
---
For what it's worth, you gave ~~some asshole on the internet~~ me a chuckle.
---
KungFu Panda was the reason I started playing WoW
---
/sit isn't blizzlike btw.
---
Consider yourself removed from the group and blacklisted from any group / raid I am in, in the future.
---
No one wants to play with a loot hoarder.
---
All wipes are the hunter's fault, so it balances out.
---
I see. Was just curious.  
---
Some others:
---
* When questing in a group, you stay till everyone is done.  You don't get your quest drops and then bail.
---
* If someone shows up while you are fighting a quest mob, invite them so they don't have to wait for the timer
---
* If ore is contested, take turns on swings
---
* If you see someone die and can ressurect them, do so
---
* Be careful with "this item reserved" runs - too much of that makes you look greedy
---
* Get an idea of BIS lists for classes you might compete with loot on - e.g., some cloth pieces are also BiS for healing druids, paladins, and shamans.  There is no "right armor type" bonus system in vanilla so the only difference between cloth and leather is armor value.
---
* MS &gt; OS on loot; it's courteous to ask before needing if it's for an offspec
---
This is the best answer here - too much broken tooth hype, it's DPS is the same as any other cat.
---
While i always liked Undercity, I still think it was a lost opportunity not using Lordareon as the Undead capital, more akin to an undead/cursed Stormwind. 
---
There's also a vast difference between dailies that just let you earn gold / mounts / cosmetic bs, and dailies that are basically 100% mandatory if you want to progress your character. That stuff came later, though still arguably during TBC with the IQD dailies.

I made a video about this a week ago. I feel like if you pick a streamers server you will have a bad experience. It’s not the streamer that will ruin it though it’s going to be their fans. Classic should be about classic not about one person. 
---
Go PVP realm and find people to quest with. You'll make friends as nearly everyone loves having a healer back them up, especially since pulling more than 2 mobs on a lot of classes=death quite often and the run back is long. Gankers are much less likely to target you when they see you're in a pair as well. Plus if you're holy you're gonna want someone to kill shit for you anyway.
---
Yeah, you stick with nonsense and I'll just enjoy classic. I'm sorry they don't want to make your pirate server changes, but we will be better off without them. Reality is the changes they are making are for a smooth launch (Which MMO's need if they want to be successful) and because they aren't going to pay an army of GM's this time around when they have already automated the solution. 
---
Have issues with it, many people do, but adding a change to the core or the game because you can't handle the game as intended is not the solution for having classic be as close to vanilla as possible.
---
It will slow them down for sure, and the specific nerds that want to follow them wont be able to keep up most likely
---
Protection kills slower which means you take more damage (slower kill speed, and then longer recovery.) Since arm and fury can both tank dungeons without difficulties, prot is a horrendous choice. 
---
If Arathi highlands was a real region we'd have nuked it by now. Such a charming combination of giant ugly raptors and tarantulas, just waiting to aggro and daze you as you walk by.
---
remind me! 1 day
---
Look up Skull of Impending Doom! If you're not careful, you may vendor it without realising it's worth, and it's a neat ace up your sleeve for breaking polymorphs or something.
---
The NA population on said server really isn't that much larger than that of servers back in the day. Half the server is chinese which we just learn to ignore. 
---
Forcing a crit by spamming a /sit macro to trigger abilities that activate upon being crit does not work on live servers and has never worked on live servers. This is a private server bug.
---
Bring this
---
\-Nothing
---
Forget this
---
\-Anything that wasn't in Vanilla WoW from 2004-2006.
---
\-Loot sharing

---
Remember: cat durid is 4 fite
---
This is for sure someone that does not understand how having 'tourists' is a good thing for pretty much everyone.
---
I'll quote someone else (http://forums.crestfall-gaming.com/index.php?/topic/2150-population-cap/). I completely agree.
---
"A higher population doesn't equal to more social interaction. You have tons of players around in todays retail WoW, still everyone is playing for themselves. Because they're not depended on each other. Same principle applies to the world of vanilla. The fewer players are around, the harder do quests get. And the harsher and unforgiving does traversing hostile locations become. Because of this, you really start to appreciate the company of other players.
---
I've played plenty of pre-Cata retail and p-servers with blizzlike caps. Of course it is harder to build a group for specific quests if players aren't just presented to you due to overcrowding. Just waiting for another player close to an elite creature could be very well pointless for hours. But it was this exact reason why my friend list was full of people of my level. So we could contact each other in case of group quests. I was changing zones to help them and they did to help me. Somtimes we even re-did pre-quests together which one side has already completed, so that we both could profit from the task. And it was this adventures and challenges that lead to getting to know each other and to forming friendships.
---
In contrast to this, having too many players around is - for a start - diminishing roleplaying aspects like world building and immersion. I.e. locations loosing their dangerous atmosphere and meaning, due to always having players around steamrolling enemy ranks. So places with a story and certain peculiarities, that you might have struggled with and created memories from, simply turn into just another grinding spot. Plastered with NPC corpses and people farming. More alive, sure. But no longer as authentic, vast and scary.
---
Every zone in the game is more challenging and dangerous if you're approaching it alone. Not pulling too many mobs in buildings/caves, fighting your way in and back out alive from enemy territory, keeping an eye on your cooldowns and HP/mana, not letting them run off into another group when they're low on health. What made vanilla great for many people is trying to survive in this world on their own. Attempting every quest alone, and either improving and succeeding. Or realizing that some task are too much for a sole adventurer. That you're not supposed to do this alone. All of this gets negated and obsolete if you have so many players around that you can just make your way through a cleared path right to the quest target. And if there's no incentive to group up with other people other than being able to tag the mob.
---
Having too many players also can lead to competition, where you start to disparage the presence of other players. Because they're killing your quest mobs and looting your quest items. Just going to the spawn of an elite mob and joining random players by typing "Inv" to quickly kill it doesn't lead to forming bonds. No, this can entirely happen without anyone exchanging a word or emote. But having to actively build that group in town, traveling to your target location together, fighting your way to the elite, maybe even wiping in the process, and finally killing him, did. This is where my most memorable pre-Cata moments come from. Failing a quest over and over, therefore seeking someone who could help me. Finding that person, doing the quest, maybe even fail together. Become friends in the process.
---
Retail Pre-Cata: Me and a friend slowly fighting our way into a scourge base, having to fight our way past zombies and monsters. It did feel like an adventure, because the scourge hordes were dense and one mistake could mean the end of us. No one was hustling or competing with us. It was up to us to infiltrate the base and make it to our target. When we finally arrived at the elite creature, we attempted to kill that thing 5 times. We died, but we tried again. We improved our gameplay. We read into the quest text more and spotted something helpful that we missed. And then we finally did it. It felt epic. It was rewarding.
---
P-Server with non-blizzlike population: Me and a friend go into a scourge base. It's already full of players farming and there are hardly any mobs around. Getting to the elite mob is no problem at all. The elite is dead, there are 3 people waiting for the respawn. We type "Inv" into /say, get invited. We wait until the mob spawns. We kill him in no time. One guy says thanks, everyone immediately leaves the group and we head to our next quest. Not epic. Not rewarding.
---
I've played plenty on &lt;redacted&gt; PvP with their concurrent player count being exactly at 5k. And sure, there are tons of players around and you're joining groups frequently. But it is a lot less personal than it used to be in vanilla retail. And not as rewarding if you don't actively build the groups yourself. The world most certainly feels more alive, but it also feels a lot smaller and cramped. Also non-existent world PvE challenge, broken roleplaying immersion, competing and rushing with other players for quest mobs/targets, joining and leaving groups becomes an unpersonal routine. It's almost like people are just playing for the population hype and not for the game itself."
---
I found the wotlk normal and heroic dungeon modes already boring, because you don't only run the instance x times for your drops, but you have to run them another y times for the next ilvl.
---
Content creation may be the biggest part in development. You need designers, scripters, storytellers..
---
Reusing already designed content is the cheap way, and that's how it feels:  just cheap entertainment.
---
He made that up. 
---
MC and BWL will always have PUGs. MC for Thunderfury and BIS for Fury Warriors I think.
---
BWL for the Trinkets.
---
T2 is for me the best Set for any Class. I don't know why, but they all look cool as fuck.
---
If you only wanted to pick a class that looks awesome in T2 you would be screwed.
---
Known exploit is no longer exploitable.
---
And how can you blacklist me if you don't know my name? I'll never use the name maluxorath because I will never play as a male character.
---
The real population of classic is going to be magnitudes bigger than nost for so many reasons. Using nost as a 'ballpark' figure is just asking for a disaster.
---
they have Teldrasil at #4 which leads me to believe the creator of the lists first character was a night elf.  I find teldrasil to be the worst starter zone in the game by far lol
---
Take a Tank of some sort: Bear or Turtle  
---
Take a DPS- Cat or Raptor
---
Take and Exotic- find you a rare pet. :)
---
This is such a good choice for the price and currently on Amazon for $665. I am actually a bit tempted myself.

Afaik they wanted to make it into a dungeon or raid. Stromguarde or perhaps even Stratholme would be capital instead. 
---
Unspoiled land? my ass.  Barely a tree in sight if any, most are eaten by Bovine Hordes.

I feel like back in the days, any famous WCMovie maker would get extra people on their server. The same about big and famous guilds such as Nihilum, Method, and Curse. Then there were the big popular PvP &amp; RP servers. Servers such as Stormscale EU would get a lot of attention and people would transfer there just to find people to do arenas with. I’m not well versed with NA or other regions though.
---
Personally I remember a huge influx to a smaller server that I played on at the time. Totalbiscuit was growing on Youtube and had quite a lot of followers when he transferred to our server. Several guilds were made (trollfacedotjpg and similar names) and the server had a negative experience because the community changed so drastically. I used to watch some of his vids so it was kinda random for a massive zerg to this smaller server.
---
So it could really go hit or miss, but I don’t trust the attitude of today’s community of toxic twitch chat and people who feel that massive griefing and drama are the only way to troll. Potentially longer queue times and an un-Classic community would make me want to avoid streamer servers. Of course YMMV and everyone has different preferences when it comes to these things.
---
Interesting item, for those of you too lazy to research: offhand +7int; use increases run speed by 60% for 10 sec while draining 100-500 Mana and health every 2 sec
---
I remember spending most of 2004 reading through the wow website about classes and spells, imagining what characters I would create. Nothing compares to that feeling when you have been preparing to play a new RPG for months (or years) and you finally start playing!
---
I'm playing on a private server now and it's been out for a while so a lot of people are 60 and it's just insane how many people there are everywhere. There's ALWAYS 50+ people standing outside DM north. 24/7. Economy isn't as screwed as it was on Nost but the only place to farm is instances pretty much. Wherever you go to farm there's already 10 people there.
---
I played on a very high pop server in vanilla, it was nothing like this at all. I'd say between 3 - 4k would be ideal personally. But 10k+ is just insanity.
---
I could do three routes around EPL on nost and not find a single plaguebloom. There were just so many people farming them. Trying to like kill a devilssaur? Forget it, 15+ people already camping each spawn point. Gathering progressions even when I started leveling as BWL was out, not a fucking chance. I entered Silverpine with like 5 in herbalism. Didn't get a single herb for entire Silverpine and then I had outleveld peaceblooms so I just came back at 60.
---
Duskwood and Dun Morogh are criminally low ranked on this list lol
---
Increasing server cap also increases world PvP, in turn making ganking a bigger problem than it originally was, significantly changing the PvP server experience.
---
Personally when i had a hunter, I liked the gator, Snake, and scorpid.
---
Stopped reading at /sit. 
---
Y'all are going to need to get your heads wrapped around that that shit is not going to be in classic. 
---
I was about to link this video, lol. I think everyone should give it a watch and THEN provide a meaningful argument.
---
Not all biomes have trees. 
---
&gt; One of my biggest concerns about classic is people being unable to differentiate between an authentic vanilla experience, and the experience they had on private servers.
---
Institutions arise out of perceived necessity but then people inevitably become attached to them over time.
---
I am also concerned that pservers have become their own thing over time. Some players have become attached hard enough that they want to replicate the pserver experience rather than accept they were never quite the thing but just temporary alternatives due to Blizzard being stubborn.
---
UC was also the best layout in terms of getting where you need to get to, fast. 
---
But it was a bitch to get into. 
---
If crossing those bridges didnt cause me to dismount every fucking time and if it had a zeppelin that went to The Eastern Kingdoms I would keep my hearth set to Thunder Bluff, no question. It's a beautiful and well laid out city situated right in the center of the continent. I will say that TB is where I like to keep my bank alts due to the city being less populated so I can log in and run back and forth to the AH with less lag.
---
Except for that darn flight master. Every time I’m in UC I have to circle that top level at least 5 times before I find the flight master. It’s like the Boralus portal room but worse.
---
I always hated the layout.  It's a fairly horrible layout imo.   I guess they wanted it to be like the Horde's equivalent to Ironforge,   but as far as the concentric layout goes, Ironforge was always much easier to get around in, and to for that matter.
---
from my notes:
---
* “Clutch of Foresight” trinket (From strat to counterspell)
---
* Magic dust (sleeps target) - Dust Devil in Westfall (~45% drop rate)
---
* Large rope net (immobilize) - Darkshore or Westfall
---
* Skull of Impending Doom – Badlands start (Requires lvl 36 to start). Tablet is outside Uldaman, then to UC
---
 
---
* Tidal Charm - Prince Nazjak (43%)
---
  * the exact location is in the south , in the sea between Arathi and Wetlands. Coords can be found on classic.db, but it’s easy to find he usually spawns inside one of the sunken ships on the bottom of the sea or in the nearby ruins. 
---
  * ~32 hours respawn time
---
My most missed Tauren settlement is the one from Old Thousand Peaks. Just a weird little community on top of a random spire accessible only by elevator or by convoluted rope bridge shenanigans. Then you finally get up there and the madmen never bothered to put up a fence or anything. 
---
I liked to get the pink Tallstrider from Mulgore. So pretty :)
---
Mulgore would be a forest though. It's not a desert  or tundra or alpine climate zone
---
I always thought that Ironforge (as a similarish layout) did it better than Undercity.   Undercity had too many bridges and passages to nowhere IMO.   It was murder for me as a new player.  I hated it at the time.
---
Not only that but the implications it has on the ability to farm at high levels, and in turn, the economy.
---
Hope they keep this authentic.
---
If you have time to cast smite then mana burn is pretty much always the better option. Seriously, mana burn is one of the most broken and underated priest spells in the game. Priests hard counter a lot of classes in the game that shittier priests struggle against, just because they can't press that mana burn button to make any mana using class completely useless.
---
Something that I don't see discussed here often is that Blizzard hired externally as well as shuffled internal talent for Classic Games (currently vanilla and Warcraft III). There are only two listings currently, so I don't have access to the old listings. The two that are currently listed are full-time positions. I'm assuming this means long-term, career-like positions and not some sort of short term contract. With that in mind, it seems likely that they have plans for more in the future. I'm a software developer and, as much as I would love to work for Blizzard, I would have a hard time signing up for something I knew would be temporary. I could be wrong with these massive assumptions. Maybe I'm just picky. I would imagine as soon as Classic WoW is released, they will begin working on the plans for their next release, be it new content, TBC, etc. Otherwise, what does this new team have to do other than maintenance? I'm really curious about this topic and wish we had more information from the new hires, but I'm sure that's going to be on lock down for quite some time.
---
I'm not sure how that comment is relevant. Obviously the new game have changed database since then while also upgraded various of other things. But that still comes back to the point where there's plenty of Vanilla bugs which even private servers can't fix or haven't had the ability to fix yet. Which again, comes back to OP saying that a 2006 having bugs in 2019 is inexcusable, which gives away he doesn't know what state current Vanilla is in and just because the game is old, it doesn't mean that fixing the bugs won't be hard.
---
&gt; Mulgore would be a forest though. It's not a desert or tundra or alpine climate zone
---
Now you've done it. Got this stuck in my head again:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koSq-KecPm4
---
That's a really rose tinted memory.
---
I was a noob warrior who joined a good guild. My experience was of stocking up DKP in MC and getting g-kicked for wiping my guild in vael.
---
Imagine having a bad day and then logging in the next day to a gray tabard after signing the charter. Imagine tanking for people despite only having joined for gear to PvP in only to get them geared and you kicked after many MC and Ony runs while you got nothing.
---
Imagine having to join a brand new guild and start fresh only to have your shitty ex guild leader have the audacity to whisper you during an MC run if he could join our raid and ninja the t2 warrior pants. 
---
I told him no obviously. But I still can't believe he had the balls to ask me that.
---
I ended up being the backup tank for the new guild I joined. We cleared through BWL and I got good gear for PvP. I guess the story has a happy ending but god damn if people think the community was better.
---
I will play as a priest, I will then mind vision your computer to see your account.
---
Clutch of Foresight is not a trinket. Its an unique item with one time use.
---
It's a joke, it's the "Coming Soon" picture for Undercity.  This is from an old, old website.
---
It was never clear whether or not you rubbed it.
---
And the lowest response would be "Azshara," making it the least liked zone.
---
Maybe you aren't too retarded to comprehend something as simple as that? Your argument is so asinine it's tantamount to saying "there are hundreds of people that like to eat dog shit, so you can't say that it's the least favorite breakfast."
---
Calling it a phase is kind of weird also, since WoW since Wrath also uses a technology called "Phasing" to put players in to different phases of the world. Where the world can look different when for example you completed a quest chain and your mate didn't. Even when grouped this will put the both of you in a different phase and you cannot see eachother at times.   
---
Enemy Cast bars absolutely shouldn’t be a thing in classic, especially in PvP.
---
Same goes for HP amounts in PvP imo, you can look at peoples armor and more experienced players are going to know how well geared somebody is.
---

No problem. As far as GPUs go on laptops, I'd look for a GTX 1050 or greater, preferably with 4GB of VRAM.

Wow. I've never seen that video but I just adore everything about it. It's a great classic folk-type song, truly good lyrics, and even the fact that it's not sung 'perfect' (on key nor on beat) adds to the charm and authenticity. I love it. Thanks for sharing!

Tauren druid was my first character switched to alliance as my friends were ally.
---
I would like to play a horde pmaythrough but eith limited playtime, I want the nostalgia of my priest 
---
There are no PvP servers in retail WoW either. It's a completely different system with PvP sharding, etc. It makes absolutely no sense to compare Classic servers to current retail "realms."
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status
---
Eh, higher attack speed means more frenzy up-time.
---
I think you’re completely missing the point
---
My biggest con to rolling a Mage first for Classic is the horrendous tier sets. Total ass.
---
Blizzard's website also says you won't be invited to beta unless you have full retail version of one of their games.  
---
[https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7064](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7064) 
---
It's a plain.
---
Player numbers effect balance a lot though. As you will need to rebalance the whole economy else you get a pserver economy shitshow. You will need to change a lot of stuff to get the same economy with a 10k player cap server as that you had in Vanilla with a 2.5-3.5k player cap
---
Yeah, snakes are awesome bud sadly only tameable come wotlk (or was it BC?)
---
Technically, whatever Blizzard does implement, people can still exploit the spy "industrial" way. Getting a deserter buff on a character is no big deal just hop onto another character, rinse and repeat.
---
THERE IS NO WAY BLIZZARD CAN FIX DODGING.

\[NA/EU Alliance\] - RP-PVP looking for raiding guild with strong RPers. I'm planning to main a priest for raiding, preferably discipline, and I've been convinced to roll dwarf. I'm still theorycrafting some builds, but the one I keep coming back to is 32/17/2. I am happy to spec however is needed for raid progression, but hope to play around with a few builds when we're farming. I am looking for hardcore raiding primarily, but a good team that does the pre-raid material together, as well.
---
I have not played a priest in Vanilla before - my main was a restoration night elf druid during vanilla and my only other 60 was a human warlock, but I have played a priest extensively through other expansions. I raided pretty casually in vanilla, since I was a teenager at the time, so I am excited to get back to vanilla for some hardcore raiding.
---
I have some vacation saved up, so I'm considering using it to blast through to 60 in a few weeks. My schedule is pretty flexible for raid times, and I travel a lot between North America and Europe, so guilds in either location would work for me - will settle into one when we get closer to release, but my primary driver in picking a server will be finding people who fit.
---
Indeed, the squeals of the boars are the stuff of nightmares
---
you leveled through retail to see what you missed in Vanilla? oh god...
---
The kind of autist who is asking for ‘hardcore fans only’ servers

Ironforge says hi

I was a noob tank. lol I solo'd to lvl 60, I had talent points in all 3 trees, and had 0 idea how to tank. I was kicked from dungeons too many times. I had never played Warcraft nor had I played a MMORPG. So the first memories are pretty harsh, and I learned the hard way. But I learned, and I was lucky enough to find a good guild.
---
I would say we all have good and bad memories. No one expects this next time around to be perfect, but I like to think the community will better than what it was.
---
Streamers can't exist on PVP servers really, since there will be legions of people trying to do nothing but gank them, wherever they may be. They also avoid RP servers like the plague. So unless if you're on a non-RP PVE server, I don't think there is much to worry about.
---
The only thing from your post which should ever be considered is customisation.
---
I even really wouldn’t mind if we had the chance to change haircuts ingame, I hated my mains haircut back then, it looked good until I started wearing helmets and then it clipped through them all.
---
It would be shame if it got fixed. Farewell, reck dps pve.
---
The shoulderpads that started them all.

What made you respect the hunter?

I feel like a lot of people are really misinformed about what roleplayers do. We don't walk everywhere, we don't rp in dungeons or raids, you still use the AH, talk casually in guild/trade chat, ect. For some people it is full time, meaning they are always in-character and anyone can approach them for roleplay. For most people though, it is part time and pretty much every wow roleplayer has a rp addon that can flag you as out of character if you don't feel like it at the moment. Usually we'll just plan out a rp with friends or a guild and go do it, or if we want random roleplay we'll go to a city, mark ic and hang out, maybe do a few emotes about what our character is doing. Hopefully that made sense? idk
---
There have always been shitty people in MMOs because there have always been shitty people IRL. The difference is that in retail there is no incentive to even form a real relationship or sense of community with anyone when you can just do LFR. I will say that in the year or so I've played on a private server, it feels very similar to what it felt like back in say 2005. There are differences (both good and bad) that I fully expect at least in some capacity to be present in Classic. One bad thing in private servers is the server pops are too big, I expect this to be a minimal issue come classic. Another thing is the emergence of reserve runs in dungeons and pug raids (Not talking about reserving the ZG tiger mount, but reserving gear that most people would want). I expect some of this reserve run stuff to carry over into retail classic. Guilds &amp; raid leaders expect full consumes even in casual guilds and even in pugs. Too much of the game has been figured out already. The upside to this, is it makes the encounters easier. Even an inexperienced casual guild can clear MC the 2nd week it attempts it. This allows for more freedom by making raid schedules less intensive. It also allows for guilds over time to be more willing to take "meme specs". Thr player base is older. We are adults, many of us have our own children, mortgages, a family, &amp; "big pants jobs". Guilds are therefore more understanding of scheduling conflicts. Players are also more likely to be a little less edgelordy and even a bit more helpful. Of course my of the helpfulness depends on server pop size, but still. I think we will see a mixed bag come classic. It wont be the same, but that in some ways may not be a bad thing?

**{EU} &lt;Pertento&gt; RP-PvP, Alliance dedicated raiding guild recruiting!**
---
**Philosophy**
---
At Pertento we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. We value social cohesion and respect among our members which ensures our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters. 
---
It is also our desire to circumvent the min-max culture that is omnipresent in the current iteration of WoW, and that has unfortunately also burrowed its way into the vanilla WoW scene. By ditching the elitist attitude we have made room for other classes and specialisations that are considered feeble by many players. As a result we are not simply playing a game of spreadsheets, instead we provide players with the choice to focus more on the role they want their class to play in group encounters. 
---
That said, we are a dedicated raiding guild (we prefer to avoid using the term hardcore) and that means our expectations of raiders are **high**. We expect everyone attending raids to be fully prepared, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’ class. We will strive to clear content timely and will adjust our core raiding team appropriately if deemed necessary. There will also be room for more casual players who occasionally want to attend a raid.  
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule**

Wednesday &amp; Sunday 19:30 - 23:00 CET

*Socials and RPers welcomed with open arms too!*
---
I remember we skipped to the last boss by jumping down into the lava from the Anvil room. All I could think is "this is bullshit, there's no way anything is down here". Well we killed Emperor Dagran Thaurissan and I found out that the MC entrance was located in the dungeon as well. 
---
As long as classic stays level 60 I would love new raids, I just don't want to see progress disappear so keep any new items between levels of onyxia to naxx depending on difficulty of new content.
---
Nope. 
---
Why is the owl so good? 
---
Played on one in Vanilla (Shadow Council) as well as non-RP servers in both vanilla and private.
---
It was a lot of fun, even if you're not into actually participating.  Player base was generally more mature, and personally I liked it mainly since you had actual creative player names, not names like "lovestospooge", so it felt more immersive.  In most cases it was inclusive rather than exclusive- you could drop in to a tavern, drink some wine and tell fishing stories to another player if you felt like it.  If not, you just went about your business and no one bugs you.
---
For most people, you didn't go around talking like "My lord" or "My Lady" (although plenty did), it was more just that you at least made a token effort to keep things somewhat in-world in /say.  Basically just not discussing Counter-Strike.
---
Most other chat channels (trade, looking for group, etc) were explicitly out-of-character.  There were a few guilds that were specifically RP guilds that had in-character guild chat, but most guilds were just like on any other server.
---
You'd see neat things a lot, like a parade of orc warriors marching outside Stormwind menacingly, or a gathering of druids in a park chanting, or a paladin on his mount pacing before the rest of his party delivering a rallying speech before starting a dungeon, stuff like that.  And it's fun sometimes to see someone RP their wares in trade chat ("My forge broke and I can't afford it fix it so I'm getting out of the business!  Selling bronze bracers for CHEAPER THAN AN ORC's MOTHER!").  And if you were really having a bad day, you could go mess with a group that was RPing by participating uninvited yet completely in character (I'd often crash weddings as a drunk rogue who mistook either the bride or the groom for his long lost love).  Some groups appreciated it more than others.
---
Downsides was that the sever population tended to be smaller and harder to find groups sometimes.  And the prices for Black Mageweave Leggings were astronomical.  Also, Goldshire.
---
Also, sooo many weddings.
---
Haha they seem to be pretty worked up over it. Calling me an insane school shooter and shit over a video game. Blizzard fanboys...what can you do?
---
My bad. Had a brain fart thinking 1.12 was before 1.9
---
spooky arthas sound files?
---
Ohh yea of course but what blizzard call sharding is actually what i see most people calling phasing.
---
That's... not a bug, you realize this right? It's something that's just in the game. If you're sitting down, you get crit. 
---
I remember this too! I also remember the early teaser ads in the Frozen Throne manual :)
---
Haha yeah keep in mind the mailbox is at 12 o clock
---
Flight path is roughly opposite
---
TB and Mulgore are special for sure. Cairne Bloodhoof is the basically the Warcraft Optimus Prime.
---
Always a slot. 
---
Most everyone on a rp realm will play the game the same way you would on a pvp or pve server, which includes guild/general/trade/lfg, talking about game mechanics, ect.
---
Anyone who's serious abt rp will download an addon (the popular ones atm are myroleplay and totalroleplay, no doubt they'll be ported over) which has an option to mark them as OOC or IC. Let me give an example -
---
You roleplay a human farmer named Joe. If you're marked as out of character, it's just you going around and playing the game. If you're marked as in character, you're now doing what Joe is doing. So if you want to write about Joe getting a drink, you'd use /me or /say to convey that. 
---
I've noticed that even while IC trade/general/lfg and guild chat channels stay OOC, it's really only /say, emotes and maybe whispers that become in character. If you need to say something in those that is OOC and you don't want it to be confused for something Joe is saying, you put brackets around it ((like this)).
---
You should totally give it a shot! RP is fun and even if you don't do it, it adds a whole new layer to see all those people walking around and writing about their characters, plus the maturity aspect that others have talked about
---
Agreed - I rolled Warlock in vanilla. I will roll a Mage for Classic, but damn if the difference in quality of the tier 2 set doesn't make me think twice!
---
Not a theory, in vanilla I leveled on Turalyon and one of the guys in &lt;Fusion&gt; ( they did good in vanilla but were top 10 in BC), was a terror, he would just run around 1shotting preople if he got a wf proc.
---
Youre making me question priest or druid for vanilla xd
---
Wait, why do you say that?
---
Could you give me a little more background on this picture?
---
No, to see what he missed in retail, I read it from the vanilla perspective at first too.
---
0.5, 1, and 2
---
mnmmmmmmm
---
Strength only outweighs spirit if you plan to play casually, but for people who plan to race to 60, I highly recommend prioritizing spirit until 30. Spirit drastically decreases your downtime in between killing mobs and downtime is just as important as killing time.
---
People like you who complain about dumb irrelevant shit like this instead of stuff that matters are more of a concern. 
---
thank you! updated
---
One of the great things about sets, aside from looking badass by the bank, is putting them away when you’re done with them.
---
Once I got 8/8 Stormrage there was no need to put on Cenarion even for the fire resist on Rag, but I would still take the set 8/8 Cenarion out of the bank and slap it on once in a while and remember how hard my guild and I had to work to get that gear, let alone what I had currently.
---
A really cool thing about WoW is that every piece of gear comes with a story attached. Like the time I got Lok’amir Il Romanthis and the Shaman in my guild was fucking tight about it, or how I randomly got my Earthshaker and would hit people with it in BG’s for laughs, or how I almost reached another plane of existence when I finally got my Stormrage belt, thereby getting the 15% mana set bonus and watching my healing efficiency go way up.
---
When you fight and claw and scratch for every piece of set gear, even if they aren’t BEST IN SLOT NOT RAID OPTIMAL OMG it doesn’t matter because you invested the time and received the reward. It’s a really special feeling, especially if you get something you’ve been lusting over forever.
---
I agree that it's important, I just don't think you should stack only spirit over the other stats. If you stack only spirit you'll lack the appropriate amount of strength to kill monsters in time, then increasing your damage taken and increasing your downtime.
---
I'm just saying there's a happy medium.
---
it plain
---
I can hear you, Pratt!
---
I think it would be neat if a few races ditched both the horde and alliance and formed their own faction. Could make a unique story line for an expansion and just mix things up in general. It would probably be to much fun though.
---
Damn. That sounds a bit.. intense. There's 20 bars per level, so that means level one, which normally takes about two or three minutes, is gonna require 400 push ups!
---
I'm quick with math so maybe I can help out with a, still intense, but more manageable plan.
---
Level 1-3 = 1 set per level
---
3-5 = half level
---
5-10 = quarter/5 bars
---
10-15 = 4 bars
---
15-25 = 3 bars
---
25-35 = 2 bars
---
35-60 = 1 bar
---
A lot depends on your leveling speed and time commitment to daily playing of coarse, but starting at the most intense level and getting easier and easier in the following weeks is generally not what's recommended fitness circles.
---
Stack spirit, win.
---
I was thinking more along the lines of spells. Auras for Paladins, Any ongoing buff, really. So Ice armor for Mages could have frosty stuff, flames for molten armor. Demon armor for warlocks would have purple stuff, etc.
---
That way it celebrates and distinguishes the classes/specs, not the items.
---
Bloodfang here I come again. You WILL be mine once again.
---
Classic is Luke.
---
Luke before the hot mess that is TLJ, anyway.
---
Look up the definition of complaining
---
Just read the series review so you can talk about the show with her while you dungeon 😂
---
Just use your toaster.  Most toasters built within the last 5 years or so have the specs to do it.  You may need one of the ones with four bread slots though.
---
Man I miss the old website, it felt so cozy!
---
I played a priest for a short period on a K server and felt like going druid for classic.
---
Now I remember how priest are always welcome
---
In so many situations that I may roll one :s
---
Just a pain to level, they rly are the worst in that aspect.
---
&gt; but the longevity of the game has to be brought up.
---
Why does it have to be brought up _again_ though?
---
When joined discord, I was immediately warmly welcomed by the people. 5/7 would join discord again.
---
BC. cause i rolled a Hunter in BC. Serpents not the winged ones
---
There is a support group for people that identify with mechanical objects. Is it the spinning of the blade or the missiles and machines guns you identify more with??
---
Warriors might be a decent thought too. They have the ability whirlwind and that looks like a helicopter blade spinning!!
---
I know it's very appealing to jump in and experience private servers, but trust me - you are NOT missing out on anything. The launch of classic will surpass any private server launch in history. By investing your time in an unstable server, you're not only ruining the initial experience for yourself, but also wasting it.
---
I never used the word "simple". 
---
Hopefully these server-wide shitlists, need screenshots or something to validate a ninja or poor behavior. Would hate for it to turn into a Yelp type thing where people just make up shit about people they have a personal problem with.
---
The scene where Arthas betrays his father (I think) can be heard near the throne if you turn off the music and turn up ambient volume.

---
For me personally, the model is worth dying for several times. Will be a pain, but I gladly pass on camping BT for hours and hours, and if I lose 0.2 attack speed, so be it.
---
This post has been removed due to rule 1; Content must relate to Classic WoW. As this question is about a private server experience, perhaps try asking over at /r/wowservers
---
The website's list of spells for each class made each spell and each class look so unique. I thought it was so cool that warlocks could summon items to heal themselves or enchant their weapon to increase spell damage. I remember looking at druids, seeing they had starfire, moonfire, thorns, and entangling roots and wondering where  things like force of nature and starfall were.
---
IT was a question about vanilla content however
---
That will be tricky to do. Is the bc server “blizzlike” or does it have any XP boosts? I’d say going for no exposure would have you just grinding or dungeons. Which will take forever lol best of luck to you and enjoy classic when it’s out!
---
I don’t believe they had the original data from that far back if I recall. That or something about the older databases not playing well with current standards.
---
From what was said at Blizzcon it seems Blizzard has a working reference for 1.12, but not 1.1 and that means they can make a more authentic 1.12 release than 1.1 release. The main reason however is that it's fair easier to produce 1.12 and progressively release content than it is to re-create each and every patch from 1.1 up to 1.12. 
---
Judging by the "demo" it's more like legion with vanilla clothing on.
---
Not when you're best friend is a warrior! This build you show me looks perfect for our duo level as a troll. I get blackout crits, silence, ve and Mana burn. Not getting shadowform means I can heal him whenever too. The build looks amazing for leveling sir.
---
It's Blizzlike, yes, and perhaps I should just plain out skip it 
---
&gt; It doesn't change the fact that Classic was intentionally designed with a ~2500 cap in mind.
---
Mark Kern himself has said that they slowly increased the pop cap over the course of Vanilla to 4k concurrent at 1.12
---
Issue is if they cap servers at 2.5k at launch then after 1 month you could have a 500 pop server. 
---
Maybe try to find a server that starts you at 60? There are so many 
---
Do I?
---
Yes, the quests are geared to tell a story that is unique to that set of quests. They zone moving quests will usually be like: take the crate to bilbo humperdink in outpost zugzug in theramore swamp. 
---
Once you get to bilbo he will thank you then offer quests. etc. Rince repeat. YOU HAVE TO READ THE QUESTS TO KNOW WHAT WHERE WHY HOW TO DO ANYTHING RELATED TO QUEST. There will be NO MARKERS or highlights on map. 
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nostalrius/comments/4645yc/psa_for_hunters_pet_decision_aka_get_a_fucking_owl/) is why.
---
Solid stats, Claw as focus dump, Dive for catching up and most importantly, Screech. This debuff is gold for leveling, seriously. Of course, everyone has their own preferences - but I'm gonna level with an owl at my side, that's for sure.
---
Exactly. I might have worded that poorly. I played from Classic till the end of WOTLK. Now I recently made a new character to see what's new. I personally still prefer the old days, but I have to admit some of the newer quest chains were fantastic.
---
I usually go to the Salt Flats at 30. 
---
Unless Total Biscuit comes back from the Grave to Play Classic WoW, and end turn UTTERLY DESTROY IT for not be true to vanilla. I would not worry about streamers.  On all PvP servers the imbalance of Horde v. Alliance is evident. Worst I ever been on was 4:1 Horde in favor of Alliance. Best I had been on was 1.4 v 1 Alliance favor. Most were 2:1 either way depending on time of day. 
---
Economics don't need to be balanced. They will be a shitshow either way. AddOns and the raw knowledge we have nowadays plus the greed of people make it pretty much impossible to have a "reasonable" market. No matter the player size.
---
Mark Kern has been very inconsistent on this. In [this Discord conversation](https://i.imgur.com/2GmbPpp.png) he also admitted that 3-4k was the technical maximum and that they dynamically changed the realm cap based on needs.
---
Any generic pos laptop you can get for around 300 USD should run classic...though it'd struggle in 40 man raids. I'd keep any eye on r/buildapcsales I just saw a good laptop deal in there today...guess I'll look real quick.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/adayqa/laptop\_msi\_156\_ips\_fhd\_1050ti\_4gb\_intel\_i78750h/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/adayqa/laptop_msi_156_ips_fhd_1050ti_4gb_intel_i78750h/)
---
Honestly good deal even without rebate.
---
I liked Teldrassil (it was my first as well,) and the aesthetic appeal is there. But a lot of that list is just terribly put together. 
---
Love the fuzz
---
Please just pick the low pop servers if you want to run around in your solo game. I want the big server with the big community. We can have both.
---
No. Read that again.
---
Racemols reply is what you need to read though. 
---
I really hope people crowd the hell out of asmongold and deny him kills and progress. Such low quality click-bait content needs to die.
---
Afair, soul shards are conjured items much like mage consumables. So they disappear on log out.
---
Not sure what the point would be to stash them in the bank in the time just before a raid.
---
Also, locks in our guild grinded soul shards on trash mobs in between bosses.
---
When you enter the ruins or lordaeron they play sounds referencing this [cutscene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-X8BF3UL6s) from Warcraft III.
---
The ruined bell echoes ghostly tolls, the path forward sounds of applause, and in the throne room you may hear the whispers of Arthas and King Terenas. 
---
I guess if you're speccing that far into BM, but even a 1.5 base attack speed will have frenzy up most of the time.
---
I started as Alliance - (After Burning Crusade I went Horde and have never looked back since) but Darnassus was awesome.. but the trip from Darnassus to Ironforge was the most epic journey ANY game ever gave me.. Running up that hill to Ironforge was immense.. But then hearing about a tram that ran to another city? And when I arrived in Stormwind I was sold. It looked so massive.. Recently seeing Dazar'alor gave me that feeling again.. the Troll Empire is epic!
---
I got the book last week and finished it up this morning. The pages and the illustrations are great but I flipping hate the cover. He put so much effort into the quality of this book and the cover just falls flat for me. Maybe it's irrational but the design, the shit quality JPEGs... it all adds up to be a very underwhelming cover display. 
---
Gotta have broken arms tho
---
I don't think anyone has a high-quality script like Netherwing, that's the question
---
You're right but it's kinda hard to explain. It's all about your immersion in the world.
---
&gt; Should I let go of reck paladin while I still can?
---
You should let it go if you're specifically playing a reck-bomb playstyle in PvP.
---
In terms of leveling, I still argue that it's better to respec at 32 to get Reckoning + SoC, because as a hybrid class with a self-heal you should be grinding on multiple mobs (unlike Warriors) and you're far more likely to get crit than to crit in those instances.
---
Also, Reckoning isn't wasted if it procs at the end of a fight whereas Vengeance is wasted half the time.
---
Finally, since you're going to want the slowest two-handers, the Precision talent (on the way to Reckoning) is going to be a huge DPS boost. Missing even one swing is a massive DPS loss while leveling.
---
So yeah, the “Reck-bomb” Paladin meme build isn't going to work, but Reckoning itself for leveling effectively is still going to be preferable than rushing Vengeance.
---
But what of that isn’t in retail ?
---
I honestly can't remember ever tossing any in the bank, but I imagine you would be able to.   
---
It's simpler to just keep a full soul shard bag, and farm up an extra bag or two prior to the raid. Some of the spiders between Thorium Point &amp; Blackrock Mountain are still green, I'd usually see at least one Warlock out there around typical server raid times. They drop Ironweb silk too.
---
All good points, but I think it only really extends to MC, Ony and to a lesser extent, BWL. AQ is tough and Naxx is a brutal time sink 
---
Haha paladin tier 1 looks so shit lmao
---
Huh... I never knew that UC was made by Arthas.
---
You absolutely have a point there, my bad I didn't mention it. Still, I prefer the owl since I'm kind of a dungeon whore, so owl is and will be the way to go for me.
---
I'm in a pretty similar situation myself dude. Married with 2 kids (3 and 1yo) And my wife isn't a big fan of video games, and would much rather spend time with me watching netflix or playing a boardgame or something like that. So what we have basically come up with to both meet each others needs. Is i normally only play games when she is sleeping and my kids are asleep as well. We have both of them in a really good sleep schedule atm where they both go to bed around 8pm every night. The wife normally goes down at 10, and that leaves me 2 hours a night during the week to play, and on weekends i extend that to around 6 hours a night. Getting the kids to take naps at the same time is also awesome! normally the wife will want to take one with them as well, so i get another couple hours of game time. It's not an ideal gaming situation but thats to be expected with a family.
---
I tanked SM GY and Stocks as a ret/prot paladin (seal of command + pursuit of justice, rest of points into prot) and I barely ever had to drink.  
---
Very cleary stating to group "focus this target", marking each pack, righteous fury + seal of command means basically as soon as you get a proc that mob is NOT leaving you unless you have a crazy DPS.  In my group all dps were around the same, so it was extremely smooth.  
---
Hammer of justice for mobs that break aggro, BoP after that if it's still needed, judgment of command/righteousness does like 3x threat because of righteous fury so you have a spammable boost of threat every 8 sec (assuming ret spec, 10 sec otherwise) that is off the GCD. 
---
Ret aura provides ample AOE threat to protect healer from pulling aggro.  I also had a druid in group so I had thorns + ret aura. 
---
In my two runs we had no wipes, only had DPS occasionally pulling aggro, hammer/bop solved those problems, and seal of light /judge of light generates a lot of sneaky threat as well. 
---
Leveling, prot paladins are fine.  The problems are overstated.  You don't need consecrate even!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
focus helps me a lot in pvp but i think the game would be more pure without it. same with arena 123 
---
Undead and the undercity is similar just in the opposite direction 
---
I would join this guild as well. I play on live servers right now and it's always super annoying when someone gets an attitude with you when you have to go feed a baby or change a diaper. 
---
OMG I had not 'herd' that in years!  an amazing classic!
---
And thanks for providing the evidence and to help people understand that there ain't no creature in the lands or sea quite as voracious as the great kodo!  
---
It’s a budget I don’t want to go over as I have other projects I need to pay for. When classic hits, I’ll be a father of two. Thanks for your input though. 
---
To you they might not be important, to others economics are very important and the main reason they play the game. Which kinda is the point of a lot of ppl. Just don't change things, when they don't have to be changed from the original.  
---
I’m a little late but after reading the comments, my guild would always bring one feral to BWL. We used him to tank the suppression room, every time. I believe it’s because they have great aoe tanking I could be wrong. I also believe they gave the melee a buff. He was my personal innervate guy, as a healer, we LOVE feral druids :) 
---
Cheers and good luck!
---
yes, it is because the bovine herds I spoke of  eat most young tree saplings.  My point obviously was that it would be a forest, given the climate zone, if there were no tauren  (+ kodo) 
---
If you actually watch the video from 40mins onwards you hear him say it. 4k was techical cap due to a bottleneck in their back-end early on and that originally someone wanted even lower caps than the 2.5k that was the designed cap to build tighter knit communities.
---
sounds like what closet gays tell themselves
---
&gt; Somtimes we even re-did pre-quests together which one side has already completed, so that we both could profit from the task.
---
Man, Horde-side Arathi Highlands in a nutshell. This post has a ton of valid points though. Especially bad in early-ish questing zones like Westfall and the Barrens. Having 20+ people farming Defias bandannas at one time isn't fun.
---
True, but most pets were around a 2.0 speed.  Most 1.5 or under pets were cats.
---
I do use an owl on alliance. On horde I go cat cos me lazy. 
---
because kodo eat all the pumpkins  (and birches, aspen, oak, cherries and willows)
---
it would be a forest if all the young trees didn't get eaten before they grow up. 
---
How so?
---
the singer made many more, you will be in for a treat if you just discovered his channel. 
---
As an alliance player getting 4 other people to run to wailing caverns sounds like a nightmare. They will die, get losses, not know how to get to the instance. If you have a solid group of experienced vanilla players sure. Odds are if you are racing everyone will be pretty knowledgeable by the time you get there. Still a 30m-1h run. More like 1 hour running through stv at level 20
---
The shit you read on this sub about retail becomes more and more cringy by the day
---
It used to.  Sitting was an instant crit for a long time.
---
The infamous last flex
---
Sounds like you should play mage. Druids can be very good sometimes but are weird. The mage is always good in all content and pvp.
---
T2 - Judgement.
---
It was always a lame mechanic. 
---
Cue to person waking up from a coma
---
“hmm this is just how I remember it back in 2004... wait why did half the people in crossroads just disappear into thin air?”
---
“why is this mage in my dungeon group telling me to trade this bop item I just won? You can’t trade bop items silly!”
---
Yeah, just like everyone said they would do if sharding was in classic. 
---
Oh look it is in classic, wonder what happened to all of those people. 
---
&gt; I tanked SM GY and Stocks as a ret/prot paladin
---
Add Scholomance and Stratholme to that list and you've basically lucked into the only dungeons a Paladon can reasonably tank with no issues.
---
You have to admit, any dungeon with undead is EZ mode for Protadins and it's a bit unfair to use them as an argument for leveling as Protadin in a holistic sense.
---
I admire the lack of Consecration and I agree that it's the sole culprit for the mana problems Paladins have, but your build just sounds like it has so many dead talents. Redoubt is useless to you, ditto Imp. Devotion aura. Anticipation is actually hurting your ability to tank because Dodge + Parry make Ret aura weaker.
---
I can't image what Protection talents you're picking that aren't just sitting there as wastes of talent points.
---
This is good advice.
---
Classic no. Some servers, yes. Though I have a simple solution for faction imbalance for the big streamers. Agree to roll on the same server, but opposite factions. I imagine if the biggest ones just did that it'd literally be quarantined to one server and it wouldn't be imbalanced. Good business decision for them as well, having that cross-faction "rivalry" would be good for viewer engagement. Same reason the music industry constantly makes up fake petty spats (or exaggerates real ones). 
---
Well from playing retail the open world is so useless you began to not care about it. Everything you can do in the open world feels like a giant chore. In fact, for me personally, playing retail feels like you log in to do chores then log out most of the time. 
---
There were vanity armor items that didn’t have any normal type like the Halloween masks etc. 
---
Based on what they've said they consider 1.12 the most complete version of vanilla and since this is supposed to be a static game for all of eternity it makes sense they would use that.
---
I can't wait to crash their streams with a raid of players for kicks.
---
This is one of the things im most keen on. Having an on and off time. Finishing work at 4am to grind out areas uncontested. Bonus of shift work. 
---
&gt; they won't tell anyone their name or realm
---
This isn't hearthstone, that wouldn't work. Even if there are a hundred realms, they'd be found in game within minutes. Even if they streamed with an hour delay, the secret would be out within a day. There's no point in even trying.
---
Ugh. I wish that some day I get excited about gaming as I did in WoW when it originally came back. It ruined so much for me.
---
Druids can be good in PvP, they're pretty decent 1v1 but in general they kill slow so 1v2+ is always hard.  As I recall the hardest class to deal with was warlocks since you can't do much about their fear. 
---
Mage, Warrior, &amp; Rogue (most played classes) are a Druid's best matchups. In world pvp, mobility is king and Druid is king of mobility. Can simply open with bleeds from stealth; apply moonfire and insect swarm dots then kite with mobility. A druid can also choose to root or soak all their cd's and damage with bear form with frenzy regeneration. Bear form, abolish poison, and faerie fire destroy a rogue easily. Kiting mages is simple since shapeshifting breaks roots. Bear form and moonfire beat warriors by keeping them in combat, soaking damage, and easily kiting them. Innervate is great for 2v1 since it allows you to heal behind a safe place freely and restealth. Shamans are probably a druid's worst matchup. Druid is the best class for Wpvp imo.
---
First sentence of my link: 
---
&gt;  The Pandaren April Fools was a 2003 April Fools...
---
So around a year and a half before launch is way before WoW launched?
---
There inclusion ever since seems to me more like lazy writers/devs who took an established concept because it was established rather than because it was good concept.
---
Also take a look at the third sentence in the article:
---
&gt; While the introduction of the pandaren as a race for Warcraft III was purely humorous, almost a decade later the race was added to Mists of Pandaria as a playable race. Perhaps understandably, many players also believed this to be an elaborate prank, although for many this was more desperate hope than simple mistake.
---
Making an entire expansion based on a smaller throw-away joke from WC3 is fucking stupid to me. You can think its fine and dandy but that's your opinion. Lots of people hate their inclusion, including me.
---
I bought six months of subscription time not once, but TWICE towards the end of legion (auto renew couldn't decide whether or not to cancel), then quit and never bought BfA. Last logged in a little over a year ago now and my subscription doesn't expire until next month.
---
They are being way too vague about a lot of details
---
Resto druids are great, especially if we end up with phased Battlegrounds.
---
You'll be quite the flag carrier as resto for as long as WSG is popular. 
---
You need a new client for each patch if you start at 1.1 so thats just not gonna happen ;( Would be fun though ;)
---
Optional. Make few servers cap 10k...and others who are more lean tp 2.5.....that. simple. Not planning on playing 2.5k servers...nope. its 2019. Fk that.
---
Torn playerbase between an amazing 14 year old game and a lackluster (but pretty) one year old game ruined WoW?
---
So sad, yet so true.
---
Thanks for correcting my spelling, english is not my native language. 
---
You didnt even make it to level 50 dude, you cant even accept the brd quests. Just say you dont like the game, not that you cant find or understand the story. Yeah killing boars or delivering love letters is not a story, but you barely scratched the surface. If you expect in-game cinematics or modern wow story-telling , sure you ll be dissapointed. Important quests in vanilla for story progression start after level 50 and engame quests ofcourse that are related to raids or factions( MC, onyxia, aq,argent dawn,scarlet crusade etc). I am just trying to say that you are wrong. You should have asked some veterans first on what to do to figure out and enjoy the story , instead of wasting 200h almost to nothing. Peace.
---
What type of druid? A restro druid is a lot harder to kill than a feral or balance druid.  You're not going to melt faces playing a druid, rather your goal is to outlast them.
---
I had the same feeling watching people play the demo, looks like retail with some old models thrown on it.
---
Really disappointing, doesn't look like classic with all those new features.
---
If you’re a night elf, I can’t stress enough how useful a stealth cat is. Seriously that shit is op in world pvp. In fact not only is the cat the highest dps, but stealth can help you tremendously in dungeons to avoid him pulling packs.
---
If you’re not a night elf, you could grab a raptor for very similar performance and a different look.
---
For any race an owl is the safest bet with screech, it comes in handy all the time.
---
I wouldn’t recommend the wind serpent low levels without the focus talent and really his skills are very spread out each level.
---
Finally a true tank pet like the turtle is really only needed for level 60 soloing, and even then you could just use screech. Hope this helps.
---
1.12 is the most complete and the game will survive statically for years to come!
---
\*timegates content*
---
I have a conspiracy theory that Blizzard is purposefully trying to sabotage Classic to say "we told you that you didn't really want it."
---
There's a ton of great videos on YouTube for this. Frostadamus has a good one. Just search for "vanilla pvp items."
---
Pretty sure yes, but really you should just have a full soul bag most of the time anyway; not wait till before a dungeon/raid to fill it up. You never know when you'll need them, and it's pretty easy to just throw a drain soul on each thing you kill while you are out grinding for gold/items/mats etc.
---
Same here!!!!!!!
---
They do not disappear on log out, they stay in your inventory. Conjured items like fire stones, healthstones, and soul stones will disappear, but not the shards.
---
WoW Classic is not something you can simply add things to.
---
Pretty much, but they also mentioned that they felt 1.12 was the most balanced and best example of vanilla. 
---
So, my guess is, we are basically getting 1.12 with gated content and they will most likely tune early raid content to reflect 1.12 talents. 
---
&gt; God knows why you'd want to follow someone around in game instead of playing it, 
---
I still dont understand this tbh.
---
I have an old and fairly close friend that streams quite a bit, and i dont even watch hers because it just bores the crap out of me.  
---
isn't it this
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie
---
First, No one PVE as a rogue until WoLK. But if you must. go Human or dwarf Alliance. Horde go Undead or Troll.  
---
AGAIN one does not Rogue for PvE. 
---
Same here. 2 things Im looking forward to the most. No streamers, no NA edgelords.
---
So one guy on one server in one area with his followers will ruin classic? Here's som advice: quest in a different area. If they quest in Durotar, go Tirisfal, etc. 
---
Also, I really don't think the majority of people will base their faction choice on what x streamer plays.
---
It's the other way around, shitters like you who wants a safespace to play are going to ruin classic, not streamers.
---
Pretty sure they did, at least at some point. 
---
Because 1.1 is a broken mess you silly goose
---
Might be the way I took the photo
---
One last flex 
---
Soul bag, eh? Probably won't be there in Classic as that was added well after 1.12 iirc. Added close to TBC launch if not from TBC expac itself.
---
I know for a fact that 2005 onwards (when I rolled my Warlock Main) they did not disappear. Could have been different prior to that AFAIK.
---
If you want to compare to retail then maybe you should also join a raiding guild and do mythic uldir, not just pug the noob raid. 
---
I also miss working towards a tier set when raiding, but other than that raiding in retail is really not much different except being a bit more challenging. 
---
And the people who drop out of Ghuun because it "drops shit gear" have no clue, he drops azerite pieces for each armor class, some of which might be shit for some classes, but are the only gear pieces that are actually difficult to get your hands on in BFA. 
---
Druids are hard to snare and polymorph because  of shapeshift.  Better than anyone at escaping (aside from bubble/hearth).  
---
Again, I'm not 100% sure, since I haven't played since 2010. But, I remember our locks complaining about shards constantly 🙊
---
That's how I kind of feel now. Obviously not nearly as much as the first time I played but I'm excited to start planning out my classes and races with my two brothers-in-law and seeing what we'll all play. 
---
That's why i will purposely avoid big streamers servers.
---
Yeah I do remember them being a pain but I'm not sure if I'm thinking of fire stones and such instead. 
---
Go look at the 1.1 talent trees. 
---
There is no final plot in Vanilla, which is why it has the best leveling.  You never feel like you're doing stuff just to move into other content (i.e. you don't feel like everything is building up to the Lich King or to Deathwing).  You feel like you're adventuring from town to town and helping out with what needs to be done.
---
Me, too! I feel it stronger with classes I didn't play in vanilla. But I've been clicking through talent calculators quite a bit recently.
---
Yes - in my opinion Vanilla was the pinnacle of quest story telling in WoW. They really started to miss the mark after WoTLK for me.
---
The reason is, all the quests are part of a line that increases in difficulty - usually culminating in an Elite quest or Dungeon quest which would require you to group up to complete. Often the final quest likely required you to travel to a dangerous portion of the map as well, thus increasing the challenge and the interest in the story itself.
---
I mostly played Alliance, so i can only speak to that faction - but there are EXCELLENT stories within the quests for Alliance.
---
Bandages if you can get a long sap or stun off.
---
Snowballs, fireworks, and other non-damaging items to flex on your opponent.
---
Ornate spyglass if you want a good look at a bitch.
---
lolret
---
Funny you should mention that because of the undead stuff, but tbh the exorcism/holy wrath was barely a part of my rotation.  Stocks especially I don't even recall if I had either one yet, I was just getting seal procs, judge of righteousness, white hits, and return damage from thorns/ret aura. 
---
I basically abandoned that char just shy of level 40 because I didn't feel like finishing the grind to 60 for now.  SoC and the movement talent were for better leveling, and the server I was on (rhymes with stork pail) was so chock full of people I basically tried to group as often as I could to offer heals, tanking mobs for squishy dps, blessings etc.  Solo play is obviously pretty boring.  So yeah though, I wanted to be able to tank thus the prot talents BUT it was impossible to AOE grind because of so many players so I figured soc would be basically essential to not take 8 years to kill each mob. 
---
And yeah.. redoubt, improved bop, precision to get to bok.  At that point I put stuff into shield spec to be that extra bit of cushion when I do get crit and redoubt procs, extra mitigation.  Also kind of helpful in solo play or small groups, mobs hitting for VERY little.  
---
It's not perfect, warriors have a simpler tool kit, but I think part of being a paladin tank is to kind of exert a bit of leadership and be like 'look people, focus my target and just give me a GCD or two to build threat and we're good'. 
---
It was definitely annoying to try and keep both a 1h/shield and 2h weapon up to date and if I had to do it over again I think I'd just go full ret to get to vengeance quicker, but meh.  Being around same-faction people SO often and in such large numbers meant that grouped play was a lot more viable and happening more often. 
---
FOR THE LIGHT!
---
As far as races competing, I don’t know - Darnassus is a city within a large region that resides ENTIRELY IN A GIANT TREE
---
Get out. --------------------&gt;
---
It looks far more cartoon-y now than it did before.
---
Yeah the basic mobs weren't a challenge (but for most of WoW's history they haven't been once you get your core abilities), but MoP had some of the best rares and elites roaming around. You miss one interrupt or stand in an aoe for more than a second and you died. Also while the main content mobs were fairly basic, all of the islands off the mainland had mobs that would kick your shit in if you didn't seriously outgear the content. Dungeons were a bit easier in mists but they more than made up for it with Challenge Mode if you were actually looking for challenging content and the Brawlers Guild was some of the best solo PVE content that I can think of.
---
Yes, you can put them in the bank and no they don't despawn.  I usually keep 3 or 4 in the bank in case I use up all my existing shards while leveling and I want to pull out a better pet than an imp.
---
Ah, ok, understandable.
---
And thats a bad thing how exactly?
---
Pick whatever you like more, considering youll be staring at the back of one forever
---
Pretty sure he's referring to bags like [https://classicdb.ch/?item=21341](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21341)
---
What new features?
---
This is correct. It was also released at the tail-end of WoTLK which was the end of the beginning for many WoW-players in terms of the original game design philosophy.
---
The game design's erosion actually began IN Vanilla IMO. But the then Blizzard continued choices to erode it in TBC and in WoTLK with the worst erosion of all coming from LFD introduced in WoTLK.
---
I choose a realm specifically because Hobbs was on it, and he did big raids on Orgrimmar from time to time 
---
I played a warlock shortly after release, like the end of 2004, and they did not disappear when you logged out.
---
Wow. I was 8, searched Panda MMO and WoW came up. How about you get out r/gatekeeping
---
Pandaren were not a joke anymore ever since they were actually seriously introduced in TFT (which was way before WoW launched), that's literally all that matters. By the time MoP released, the era of Pandaren being a joke was long over, because it was over even before Vanilla was released. Pandaren were established in Warcraft lore before MoP, wether you like it or not. 
---
Unless you think TFT is a joke as well, in that case I don't know what to say to you... proudly hating on one of the foundations of WoW just for the sake of hating anything that came after Vanilla I guess. 
---
druids are good at escaping and outlasting. thats about it. if you want to be a flag carrier in bgs and have this role, play a druid. if anything else - dont play it. 
---
they are one of the weakest classes in pvp all in all. though being good at 1v1 (outlasting the oponent), and good at escaping since you run fast and can reshift slows and roots, and there aren't many stuns in vanilla.
---
if you want to play a self-sustainable hybrid melee dps play enh shaman, zillions times better than feral. casters  - mage. rdruid is the worst pvp healer also (shamans paladin priest-  all miles better). so if you want to heal in pvp play something else.
---
summing up - 1v1, and FC in wsg. everything else - nope.
---
I havent even thought about this.
---
Do you need BFA to play Classic? I only own up to Pandaria I believe.
---
Hmm maybe it was fire stones and the likes I'm remembering. They were conjured, weren't they?
---
The difference is the same difference as with Avatar the Last Airbender and, say, Teen Titans GO
---
Both are cartoons (and a bit cartoon-y) but TTGO is far far far more cartoon-y and feels less serious than A:tLA
---
Are you asking us how to tell your wife you want to play WoW?
---
There's a reason the word "cuck" has been so popular lately.
---
I am 100% positive people would have also been pissed if they made an expac centered around Lario and Muigi.
---
Yeah and many people disliked that. TBC happened to be a really good game still though. MoP.... not so much.
---
Crits from sitting have never procced that fury talent on live.
---
I would just start the raid with like 8-10.  They would all be used up before the raid started, but I would just drain soul on all the trash pulls and be stocked up again.
---
Yes he did lol
---
Found the streamers fanboi. 
---
6) Getting camped repeatedly instead of just logging out, thereby wasting my time? Straight to the kill list. 
---
lmao
---
added to my kill/friends list!
---
I doubt it's even that large.  Look at a text file.  They're like 20 kb for hundreds of characters.  Maybe a WoW char is ~250kb or so.  I'm sure a private server dev can lean in on this.
---
I believe it would be better for Classic on the tech side of things to be more as it was, but I don't think they can fully disconnect it from the newer framework. The way Blizzard stated how it would change over time sounds like pooling shards like they do now, and that's what is causing problems in retail. I'm not sure how they updated the old phasing lines yet, but hopefully they are not simply converted into shards or large groups could be like a large Warmode raid is now.
---
I have a better idea.  When you're about to play WoW for the night go do an hour workout and then play.
---
&gt; 16k Nost 
---
I don't remember Nost ever having 16k. First time I played there, it had 11 or 12k, it never went higher than that.
---
I loved how long quest chains led you naturally into dungeons and areas like that. It just makes sense from a story telling perspective.
---
Goblin rocket helmet, rocket boots
---
I played through all of vanilla with a ret pally. I could aggro a mob or two and leave to go make a sandwich. mob would be down to about half hp by the time I came back.
---
Give me low-poly playable pandas blizzard! No classes or starting zones, just polygon-ass pandas

^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)

Neat. I've never touched a private server, so I'm just operating off the assumption it would trigger a crit, which is something it always did. 
---
When you're wrong, you're wrong. 
---
This. is. awesome.
---
I have a handful of projects to do and little questions I wanted answered before classic launched, and this was the blocker to all of them. 
---
Huge, huge thank you for this. Will post some OC in the next few days!
---
15% of people won't. 15% of people browsing the classic subreddit taking this poll might.
---
Behold the 50% more retribution aura damage [spec.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurxstoZEb0zbb) The closest you can come to living the ret dream while raiding as a holy paladin. 
---
I had this bag in vanilla was very useful to have the extra space 
---
yes I know - they were a LATE addition to Vanilla. Vanilla did not launch with them.
---
Oh yeah, you want wand spec for levelling.
---
Spirit tap is great if you friend understand its best you finish off mobs.
---
Vamp embrace is sick too.
---
Silence is mostly for pvp.
---
It was meant as a lvl 60 spec but can work if you take 5/5/wand
---
The point is that i’m putting such an estimate as an order of magnitude higher than nost already. 10 servers, not counting the initial couple weeks after release. 
---
As has been alluded to in the comments; are any of the large streamers based in the EU?
---
It makes me sad that WoW came up from googling "Panda MMO" :(
---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
Best storylines in vanilla.... The betrayer's questline, Thunderfury's few quests, BwL attunement quests, Rexxar quests, and of course Mankrik's wife.
---
They have a version of the 1.12 game. I think they simply don't have data left for earlier game patches. Before they announced classic they didn't think they even had the 1.12 data any more, which was one of the main reasons they said they would never do it. 
---
If they want to do 1.1 they have to do a ton of backwards engineering and research to get to that state of the game, manually patching 1.12 to be more like an older version of the game. That is a ton of work. They would then have to do the same thing for each patch, which is not straight forward due to somewhat shoddy documentation of the changes. Patch notes does not include everything, and as far as I know Blizzard don't have much internal data left from that time. 
---
Umm are you sure? I've only seen 20 videos talking about it.
---
Can do it in 5 pretty handily. With the stupid regen we saw in the demo and the 1.12 talents less will be relatively easy even if you aren't going full tryhard powerfarm mode.
---
Tanking dungeons is easier while leveling as arms, since the prot talents really don't do anything for you until endgame. Arms gives you a lot of other utility that is *extremely* useful for five mans while leveling.
---
Are you talking max level ? Because on classic there is no open world after level 60
---
They are pretty hard to find, think you have to use waybackmachine on thottbot to find one. 1.1 talents were pretty awful.
---
I dont think we need to compromise either, open 2 types of capped servers: 3k and Xk
---
Lets say xk= 5000 or 7500 or whatever number blizz thinks is right. 
---
oh man it's been a while.  some classic pasta right there.
---
Exodar is another example of awful layout. It’s just a nightmare to get around in
---
&gt;You need a new client for each patch if you start at 1.1
---
Is the client really an issue? I'm pretty sure old clients/patches exists somewhere on the internet, no? And applying it is as simple as a modern patch for Blizzard. The problem is they don't have server data for older patches. So they would have to manually recreate that which is a ton of work, without many benefits in the end. 
---
Alright, so i litterly spend 30+ mins trying to find it and sadly my memory just failed a little bit. It was the leak that we had before blizzcon that i remember it from - german guy leaks.
---

So far he is "somewhat accurate" with some of the things which he shouldnt have known, it could also just be lucky gueses. 
---
Check my comment above, i didn't
---
Hey everyone!
---
&lt;Epic Fail&gt; Is going to be recruiting on an Alliance NA PVP realm TBD when classic launches. We have plenty of experience between all of the leadership and I'm sure the players we've picked up so far. 
---
We are not going to be a "HARDCORE" guild where we require you to raid every night. We realize we're all adults now and everyone has respsonsibilities, so we're looking at raid times 2-3 days a week with an optional fourth which will be considered a Guild Bonding night where we don't focus on raid targets but we focus on helping each other, grouping with each other, doing things within the community.  
---
We don't know the long term plan for Classic WoW and we want to keep people coming in and making our guild a home. So alts and friends welcome.  
---
We will have a requirement to become a "Raider" that is still being determined when it comes to raid attendance but to join the guild and actually raid there will be absolutely no RA requirements. The rank "Raider" will be given to those that do meet those requirements and the only perk they will be given is raid slot priority over non-raiders. 
---
Tenative Raid Schedule will be based out of the Mountain Standard Timezone:  
---
Monday - Off
---
Tuesday - Off
---
Wedneday - 9PM - 12AM (MST)
---
Thursday - 9PM - 12AM (MST)
---
Friday - Guild Bonding from 7 or 8 pm-whenever
---
Saturday - 9pm - 12AM (MST)
---
Sunday - Off
---
Again these times are tenative and we will be probably creating a poll when it gets closer to summer (Probably april time frame) for everyone to vote on a perm. raid time. 
---
Loot rules:   
---
We will be going with a DKP system which hasn't been fully established yet. We feel like this type of system will be better for larger numbers of people and Epic Fails main priority is to stay releveant for the lifetime of classic wow. We decided against randoming and loot council. Randoming for the easy reason of someone that comes in for 1 night out of the month gets something that someone really wants that has been grinding it out for 2 months, and loot council is a no because we don't want people thinking favoritism or officer / raider priority is being given.  DKP is just the fairest way we saw to distribute loot. 
---

If you’re wondering about who is better in PvP, the answer is they are both good. If you want to get ranks more quickly, Mage is likely a lot better. I’ll answer some of your questions here though.
---
How is it in 1v1 situations?
---
It’s reasonable in every one v one situation although the classes that tend to hard counter you can be pretty difficult to beat.
---
Can I consistently win against other classes if I play better than them?
---
Like many classes, Druid’s beat some classes easily, get walloped by others, and have a tighter match against some. If you are high skill cap, Druid has a lot of unique tools to help in PvP but it can sometimes suffer if not geared appropriately.
---
Can I pull off 1v2 situations?
---
Probably not unless both are melee classes.
---
Can I get out of combat easily if I ran into too many players?
---
Absolutely. No other class does it better.
---
Can I top myself easily when selfhealing in a safe space (like behind a wall or tree)
---
Definitely. Slam a regrowth and a rejuv and you’ll be back in the thick of it as if nothing had happened.
---
Are there any other classes that are severely better in pvp or counter druids?
---
I mentioned before that I thought pet classes did well against Druid’s, I would also say that Paladins are a complete snooze fest as neither of you can do that much damage. Otherwise everything else is pretty fair game.
---
Druid is a very difficult to master class in PvP but because there are so few good Druid’s, you can definitely get the drop on people who don’t expect a high level player
---
Stupid question.. was it 2500 concurrent players or 2500 active characters on the realm?
---
Try tri spec 17/11/23
---
Or 19/11/21 if you dont need 4/5 shadow weaving and prefer 2/3 imp inner fire.
---
It is very similar to what you tested but you also get imp mana burn, inner focus .
---
Not added we’ll after 1.12, though. 
---
I dont think it will ruin the game for people. 
---
Sure leveling will suck with their posse's running all around them KSing them, KSing you and such, but that will end quickly. Theyll be 60 within a couple weeks and that will stop. Theres only so many BIG named streamers that will have these posse's and it wont last forever.  
---
But think about AFTER the leveling has stopped. These guys will probably be starting the biggest PVP wars in the history of classic which will just be insanely EPIC. 
---
The point I was making is that noone would play druids for example, if we went back to 1.1 talents. 
---
Level up as Arms. But more importantly, leveling a Warrior, regardless of Fury or Arms, is all about the weapon. You need to have a planned questing route and choose which weapons you will obtain before you even start leveling. There is nothing worse and more painful as a Warrior than using an underleveled or weak weapon. You need to know what quests reward good 2 handers and what pre-requisites are needed to get these weapons.
---
One weapon I highly recommend getting is Smite's Mighty Hammer from the third boss in Deadmines. This thing is so overpowered for its level and will make your leveling life so much easier. It's got an absurd damage range of 55-83 and will last you until either the Corpsemaker in RFK (useable at Level 29) or Whirlwind Axe at Level 30 assuming you have friends that can help farm the mats and kill Cyclonian. I used Smite's until Level 32 when I finally got an upgrade from last boss of Gnomeregan (that 2h mace).
---
It was added in 1.9
---
[http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch\_1.9.0#Soul\_Shard\_Bags](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0#Soul_Shard_Bags)
---
It was added in 1.9 - IDK where that is on the timeline. But that seems like quite a few patches later.
---
Oh yea, spirit tap first always, way too important. My standard build for leveling any priest is 5/5 tap 2/2 swp, 5/5 wand 2/2 martyr and 2/2 healing focus. You can tell I'm on a PVP server lol
---
Gotcha. So about 1 year prior to TBC, and about 1 year after launch. More in the middle of the life cycle I guess.
---
1.9 is before 1.12 on the timeline, therefore it will be in Classic. 
---
I'm.... A moron.
---
Mage is significantly better at PvP, no question. Druid role is FC and being annoying. Mage is strong in almost every stage and situation for Vanilla PvP.
---
* How is it in 1v1 situations?
---
If you play well, you can win anything but in most case it will take a long time. You will have to dot, kite and outlive your opponent but he will be slowly dying without being able to kill you and without being able to get away.
---
If you are lucky with some crit while opening with cat form you can burst down a clothie fast (if the clothie is sitting to drink, enjoy)
---
If you end up against a healer, you might as well get away because the outcome of the fight will not happen in less than 30 minutes.
---
* Can I consistently win against other classes if I play better than them?
---
You have a lot of tools within multiple form to use in all sort of situation, you can really outsmart any class. Each time i have lost in a 1v1 in open world, i was saying to myself "shit i could have done this, and that and that and i would have win" and each time you become stronger.
---
Also since druid are somewhat rare, a lot of people don't really know how to fight us.
---
* Can I pull off 1v2 situations?
---
Depend which class you are up against but you can especially if its melee. If they have a healer just get away.
---
* Can I get out of combat easily if I ran into too many players?
---
Druid is the best class to run away from someone or a group of people, you can shift into form to remove any slow, can stealth in cat to avoid any bad encounter (and track humanoid too), can run fast in travel form, can root melee, can tank damage in bear form while waiting for an opening and charge someone or something away from the group to then get away in travel form.
---
* Can I top myself easily when selfhealing in a safe space (like behind a wall or tree)
---
Yes, and you can even hot yourself with regrowth and rejuv to heal you while you will be fighting.
---
* Are there any other classes that are severely better in pvp or counter druids?
---
Better ? I don't think some class are better than other, each have their strength and weakness.
---
As for counter, i would say the hardest for me is shaman (esp elemental), they can heal, they can burst and they can purge.
---
Warlock can be hard if they are geared (if they are not, you can either burst them while charging and bashing their fear or outlive them with hot while feared) Spriest too.
---
Rogue will kill you if they stun lock you outside of bear form so be sure to have an insignia ready to switch asap to bear. Once in bear you can just tank them. If you find an opening, root and kite and kill them from afar (always have abolish poison on you when you start to get away from them to prevent blind, if you are blinded they reset the fight and its over).
---
Faerie fire is also rogue worst nightmare.
---
&gt; vanilla raid difficulty
---
So, easier raids?
---
&gt;streamer man bad
---
i dont like streamers but this is fucking pathetic, stop being a crybaby and grow up
---
I will assume many people will have either a hunter or mage farming alt and it will be the norm to farm with them.
---
kids these days.. 
---
I love how mild and innocent this copypasta is. 
---
It could have been “you can alt tab and watch a chick getting railed while you autoattack” 
---
but instead it’s all
---
“You can watch a boobie and a stripping lady.”
---
For some reason the name confused me, but I assume you mean Freewind Post in the old Thousand Needles.
---
Yeah, pretty dope place. Especially seeing people miss the elevator.
---
The thing is warriors cant pvp at low levels anyways, there's no need to stance dance, your not going to pummel anything or do anything except die in pvp before lvl 40. Pummel is at lvl 38 i believe. The 5% crit is pretty significant and so is piercing howl and blood craze for survivability. Being able to piercing howl when you accidentally get 3-4 murlocs is a life saver almost every time.
---
  there are going to be a lot of shit warriors FTFY. be happy more free kills in world pvp
---
It's plain simple that Tauren are savage tree-eating creatures
---
What do you mean by "all quality aesthetics are on the store"? The only store gear are the three helmets which are being removed soon.
---
I'm getting closer to being convinced. I will definitely be on a PVP server when classic drops, and leaning slightly to an RP now.
---
I won’t play on their servers but the good thing is that I expect there will be groups formed to gank these clowns just as they will have their defenders. Should make for some amazing world PvP. and protecting/killing a single player is a pretty cool objective to base some world pvp around. I assume they’ll mostly roll on PvE servers though - but you still might have people unflagging to fight against mob tagging griefers, etc. 
---
Underestimating the pleb army. They will find out within 5 minutes. legit 1 of the 50k pplwatching would need to be on the same server and see the same general chat or one of the 1000 other ways to find out. I cant wait to see Asmongold fake orgasm over getting shit he didnt collect himself handed to him.
---
That was my pre raid prepping for Naxx, I was the summoning and healthstone tool, so I would always be the first one in EPL farming shards around Naxx-entrance :)
---
Hoping some guilds dedicated to camping him and his crew form. Id roll a rogue on that server as an alt and join. 
---
Soulshards do not dissapear after logging out (thank god) and you should be able to store them in your bank. They are soulbound however so you can not mail them to an alt or trade with a fellow lock.
---
Sadly with the game being 15 years old, there really isn’t any more theory crafting to be done or spec discoveries to be made. People who think there are innovative (and good) specs to still be designed are kidding themselves. 
---
I just did a full BRD quest run yesterday 
---
My first toon was a lock, I flew into Freewind to do some questing, soul stone up and head out for adventure! I missed the elevator and fall to my death. "Well good thing I had a soul stone!" As I'm summoning my blue berry I get aggro from a patrol and die again... I miss this game lol
---
Haha, old but gold :)
---
"a character that I can play with while playing with myself " always cracks me up :)
---
You couldn't find a better place to spend that 1 point than Devotion?
---
This offends me.
---
Nah, you theory craft dude! Don't listen to people running their mouths.
---
What? Fury is good early on with zero hit rating? That is not true at all. It's actually aids. I've leveled all my warriors as 2H arms. Basically just need to keep weapon updated at all times.
---
Yeah that's the place. I really liked that zone despite not being able to remember quite what it was called. You never knew just what would be on the other side of each needle you approached. I also have a fond memory of the salt flats area.
---
Oh I assumed both would be. I only experienced the new  models a few days ago and like them. On the character selection screen at least. They're not really noticed ingame while looking at the character from behind.
---
Yeah, this is only really a concern for PvE players. And they can just avoid the servers of big 'entertainment streamers'.
---
This is the main reason i hate dyes/etc. 
---
Ironforge is definitely a contender for coolest, most atmospheric city and definitely the best laid out and accessible one. Not being able to hearth there is one of my few regrets for rolling Horde in the upcoming days. Although it's also the best city to sneak into when I inevitably roll a sub rogue.
---
Yeah, this sub and /r/wow are pure garbage now unfortunately. BFAs looking much better in 8.2 anyway and while I probably won’t play it, Diablo Immortal is going to be massively successful as a mobile game, at the very least in China. 
---
I bet its not possible to solo. 
---
Tauren don't mess with young trees, they need them  to grow big and strong so they can chop them down and turn them into big ole totem pole masher club things.
---
Yeah, I got ganked way more leveling up on a 10k pop private server than on retail.
---
Redridge had gankers in retail, no doubt. But I didn't see at least 1 level 60 ganking there every single time I went there, most of the time having multiple 60s.
---
Even stv is far far worse, especially having the stvietnam reputation. I didn't fight a lot of the opposing faction like I did in retail. Because 60s always slaughtered 1 side or the other. 
---
I'm sure people might respond with "roll pve server, then," but it really isn't the same as retail vanilla was. 
---
Who needs Warcraft logs when you have this.
---
This is from WOTLK, too!
---
Yea, I will definitely play classic, and my point is I just hope if it does well 2 years later i can move on to TBC!
---
Definitely not helped by how slow Draenei seem to run too.
---
This is nice and all but having millions of players on day 1 waiting for a lockbbox is not feasible....
---
I'd say we should let dynamic respawns happen for about a week or t wo then turn it off as most people would be out of those bottlenecks
---
I feel like people shouldn't be to worried about mega servers, i think MAX we could exspect would be 5k. The thing we already know is that blizzard does not want dynamic respawn and having a 10k realm without dynamic respawn would be such a chaos, everything would just be dead in some areas.
---
Anywhere from 2.5k-5k is fine with me tbh, their is positive and negatives with both. 
---
Thanks gents. Downloaded the client and it works. Looks like shit but it works. 😀
---
never had a problem on LH
---
Paladins are hands down the best healers in the game. 
---
They give the best buffs (raid wide threat reduction, % increase to stats meaning it scales with new content and blessing of widsom is basically a raid wide mana tide totem). 
---
They have the easiest time gearing being able to wear cloth, leather, mail and plate.
---
12 second immunity every 5 minutes which is absolutely insane in both pve and pvp. Like I can't stress enough how amazing this is and how many situations it allows you to cheese. You get to wipe bronze debuff and step out into chromaggus breath at the end of the fight to keep your tank up while he's enraged for one example. 
---
But everyone likes to cry that they don't get to do all this AND also do as much dmg as a warrior...
---
Man the more you think about Dire Maul, the more it seems to fuck classic design philosophy.
---
1. INSANE world buffs for very little effort (5-10 minute run, rogue can lockpick door, hunter rogue or sucide player can aggro boss instead of using ogre doll and feign, vanish, and or die and let group run past).
---
2. Crazy farming potential for mages in DM:E, exploitative mining nodes at the end of DM:E which can be 2 manned or less, players soloing DM:N tribute
---
3. Outrageously good items compared to Scholomance, Stratholme, BRD, etc. A lot of the items can be farmed at the instance entrances (e.g. the tanking shoulders and healing bracers off of the first boss in DM: N)
---
4. Access to crazy strong trinkets from the book quests.
---
5. Access to one of the best tanking weapons for the mid-game raiding scene for gold. Alcor's Sunrazor being the only other noteworthy item to hold that status.
---
6. Access to early leg and head enchants.
---
Like look at [this item](https://i.imgur.com/lrPcNoZ.png) from DM: W. That is just disgusting. That item is probably Molten Core quality or better. It's just absurd. There are plenty of items in there all over the place and it blows my mind how nothing from the original dungeons compares (not considering the specialty mobs added to say UBRS, Scholo, etc later on)
---
Man, I love you. Your reply to my post is simply amazing! 
---
This just made me think of something horrible. Imagine getting a raid together and stomping some streamer and his fanboys, then getting banned for "steam sniping." If that shit comes to classic, then it is truly lost.
---
I think attacking streamers with poses like that sounds like a blast, though
---
I'm sure people will do it but even on private servers where the player base is way more hardcore and dedicated than retail will be it's not all that common. 
---
Most classes have alternative means to farm which nets them around at least 75% of what mages/hunters can earn so it's just not worth it to spend 6-8 days leveling another class to 60. 
---
Yeah, high pop means the no-lifers who speed run are rewarded way more than retail, because they are out ahead of the masses, and can gank sooner, and have more people to buy their stuff.
---
Why introduce sharding as a “fix” for a problem that shouldn’t exist?
---
&gt; every needle you approached  
---
Most interesting. It is called Thousand Needles, so yes, I suppose those things would be called needles.
---
Pretty bad list IMO. also how isnt deadwind dead last? It literally has 0 content. Also blasted lands is the worst zone by far.
---
Aka: EZ-mode
---
why are you dicksucking reddit lol? 
---
y tho
---
Sweet! I've never played on RP-PVP myself but I've heard pretty good things about them
---
I popped into one and got to level 20 and stopped, didn’t want to ruin the experience. It’s fun but I agree, they don’t even compare to the demo in terms of quality
---
Yep, I will definitely give it a fair shot this time around
---
14 year old me bumped Ridin’Dirty by Chamiolionaire in BG’s. 
---
I thought I was sooooooo cool.
---
Turned out to be just *kinda* cool. 
---
Yeah. Atleast in STV you had plenty of spots to hide. Tanaris was always worse PvP wise you just die 24/7
---
The difficulty with pre Bis lists right now is that blizzard hasn’t announced if they will do progressive itemization. We don’t know what items will be available when. I’m sure it’s helpful for 90% that won’t change however 
---
Do Druid’s farm DM? I figure they might be too weak by themselves but with another Druid or rogue it would probably be a laugh.
---
I'll disagree I say theres still a lot of farming and pvp in the open world at 60.
---
Guys talkin out his ass. Only thing that seemed out of place was the lfr interface, which like many other things is confirmed not in classic and merely a hold over. 
---
Was hardly a demo to begin with, just a fun blizzcon extra to build hype.
---
you can always play on the RP server
---
Thunderbluff is my favorite too. But I feel like they didn't do it justice by making it relatively small. 
---
What does that even mean? 
---
I've tried to equate it to doing a group project for school, or playing for a sports team - you have agreed with a group of other people that you are going to show up at X time and do Y thing as well as you can - showing up late, leaving early, not giving your full attention, or otherwise half assing it is screwing over your team mates (in this case 39 other people). Yes the content is virtual - but these are real people you are letting down, they left work early, put their kids to bed, haggled with their spouses, declined social events or whatever kind of sacrifices they had to do to make time - not holding up your end of the bargain is highly disrespectful and a complete douche move.
---
2 hours of gaming represents ~ 1.2% of your total week, it's nothing. As adults you should respect eachothers need for "me time" - both of you, and 1% is about as little as you can ask for.
---
The reality is that apart from a love for heavy metal, my girl and I have almost no shared interests. So the choices are either 1.) Don't get to enjoy any of your hobbies anymore, or 2.) Negotiate enough time for yourself to keep yourself happy without making your partner feel neglected. (Also every couple months I go do something with her that she enjoys but I hate just to put some extra currency in the "love bank")
---
I spend about 6 hours a week doing BJJ between driving and mat time - if I told my friends that my girl wouldn't let me roll anymore (or do any of my real world hobbies) and I had to quit because she was too demanding of my attention, they would think she was a red flag waving psycho. So what's the problem with 2 hours for something else?
---
The fact it is a schedule set in stone should make it damn easy for her to keep herself busy while you have your commitments. On Fridays my girl works late / goes to the mall / watches shows like "Ghost Adventures" (*puts gun in mouth*), or goes out with her friends to drink / dance - things I don't like to do or wouldn't be there for her anyway, so its not like she is missing out on much by me not being available.
---
IDK man - just be up front, honest, and considerate, and I think you will find that she'd probably be more open minded than your expecting. GLHF
---
And that’s not in every other expansion + extra ?
---
More so it is just how many there are. You are way more likely to get killed when there are 4 times as many 60s running around even with 4 times the levelers. It's not like the extra numbers will help, but more 60s means more ground covered.
---
That’s what I thought/was hoping but I don’t follow the info all that closely. Thanks
---
it is more enjoyable to learn a system than to lobby to have it changed
---
Do you really think he will be satisfied with a "few hours a week"? 
---
This game is like crack, you can't just do a little. 
---
Yeah because instancing the beginning of a server launch for pop control, and fundamentally changing core aspects of the game are totally the same thing. /s
---
&gt;Yeah the basic mobs weren't a challenge (but for most of WoW's history they haven't been once you get your core abilities)
---
This was not true for vanilla nor TBC. You have to be mindful, because certain mob density or fast respawn meant a corpse run for you. And some bad talent choice or bad gear meant struggling to lvl 60.
---
I know they mattered, because this what took me in. If I tried wow during MOP, I would get bored before lvl 10 I would uninstall it soon, never to see the great end game I'm not dismissing here.
---
AND HENCEFORTH HE WAS KNOWN AS BIZNOCK THE FORGIVING. BIZNOCK HAD MANY MORE ADVENTURES IN THE WORLD OF AZEROTH, AND MADE MANY MORE FRIENDS, AND IN TIME HIS DEEDS PASSED INTO LEGEND.
---
As is tradition. This paladin fighter thing is a non starter. If you don't like to heal play a roguenor hunter
---
God, try doing those rock elemental quests in badlands. You will get destroyed by one of several horde 60s farming each spot. Or, if you are horde, get out tagged by the multiple 60s at every spot. 
---
Private server issues. Was not a part of retail vanilla. Likely wont be a part of classic unless realm pops are ridiculously high.
---
That's how vanilla works.
---
Vocal minority. They arent that popular but people are complaining because they wont have the option.
---
I take finally releasing Classic as Blizzard finally listening to what their customers are asking for. 
---
Loot trading comes to mind...
---
go make a premade then. You're playing with 4 other ppl dont be selfish expecting everyone to do exactly what you would do/want. Some people are worse at the game deal with it man. Dn't ruin their fun because you have no patience.
---
\&gt; 1.A prairie is just one type of plain. It is a more specific type of land area.

:shrugs:
---
17/2/21 is IMO the place to start for priest pvp.
---
You get so much out of the early disc talents I wouldn't want to pass it up.
---
Atleast you had one of the better tier 2.5 sets.
---
The story of WoW Classic is yours to write, you need only reach out and grasp the pen from the ferns of the dreamfoil, from the sparks of the anvil, or from the plunders of your vanquished foes.
---
in fairness, there are several functions (namely CastSpellByName(), among others) that were removed from the API in 2.0.  TBC had an entirely new approach to what was and was not appropriate for addons and macros to be able to do.  In many regards, the Vanilla API is actually more flexible than the modern one. 
---
Stormreaver represent !
---
You the real MVP (but only if you roll horde XD)
---
Indeed, i miss the days of seeing high level players in cities, decked out in purples and aspiring to be one. Hoping my class was not the one with trash tier look as there was always one.
---
Oh absolutely 100%. I think ultimately if your guild is making serious attempts to do AQ or even Naxx, you're probably optimally specced anyways and bringing full consumables. I will say that now that we know Druid tanks are viable (with proper gear &amp; powershifting) we might actually see a few more druids playing. This would also make getting groups a little easier for prebis farming also
---
I liked this encounter a lot. It's from Ulduar right?
---
Leveling week one is not going to be fun. Thinking i might just put netflix on and grind high level mobs for a bit, work on a profession.
---
And we all know how well that turned out...
---
he streams Wow on Twitch how is that clickbait? 
---
They havent confirmed so can go either way. Blizzard CM said he thought it was unlikely.
---
I remember early 2004 when I was in the sandbox alpha client trying to get up there without any functioning elevators. I was so enthralled with it, when I successfully warped up there I explored every inch. I truly felt like I was in a virtual world, even when it was completely empty.
---
If that is the only requirement then all store bought mounts would be available in Classic. We both know that won’t be the case.
---
except people do it all the time on pservers? with the 1.9.3 fix implemented. takes me 12m to do a full clear 
---
To be fair it’s a light teal color. Not pink.
---
For leveling alts. LFD random dungeons and try to do them at least once for the quests.
---
I think that talent calculator is bugged. I looked at a Shadow Weaving talent for Priest and apparently it stacks up to 15001 times. I'm not an expect on game balanced but might be slightly overpowered.
---
Do you really think 2019 Blizzactivision won't royally fuck up anything they make as far as new content?  Please let us just enjoy the old game we loved without BLizz's paws up in it
---
I wish they flipped Lordareon to Alliance and had the Undead settle in Northrend tbh. Would have been great to have them up there.
---
From what we know so far, sharding will be active in the beginning. So dynamic respawns shouldn't be necessary.
---
The talent calculator itself isn't bugged, the underlying database just has a few rare issues like that. It's still 99.9% reliable though and after many years of use I've never encountered an incorrect value that wasn't 100% obviously wrong. All searchable vanilla databases that I'm aware of mostly have the same rare few issues in the same places. Things like having a nonsense value for the mp5 given by food buffs.
---
My favorite part about druid is that you win duels by pure finesse. You'll never be a crazy geared rogue 2 shotting someone (actually this could happen as a boomkin). You'll never outright win because of the matchup. But you will be able to beat basically anything if you're skilled and practice the class. They are the most fun in pvp imo. 
---
woah, what addon was that playing a movie or something behind the game?
---
I'm in the opposite boat where I really don't like most how the tier sets look and, in retail, enjoyed being able to tailor my character to suit my own tastes. In vanilla that clearly wouldn't work because of the PvP implications, but it's something I will definitely miss.
---
Orgrimmar was always better IMO. Easier to navigate.
---
Waaaaaay too many skinny stairs to fall off and other little nooks &amp; crannies &amp; corners to get stuck in.  I spent as little time there as possible. 
---
Thank fuck I live in EU so I don't have to deal with this. As for you poor americans, pray to God you don't roll the same server as them, or find out which server they play on and avoid it like the Scourge. From what I've heard across several streams is that most of these streamers will circlejerk together on one server, so only one server will be greatly affected.
---
and no one will see it coming because its a crab...
---
As a kid, I genuinely took like a half-hour to find out how to get into the "city" part of Undercity.
---
But you'd have to deliver the killing blow which is problematic, or am I wrong on this?
---
That’s some Olympic level backpedaling right there. 
---
I think it's likely this will happen in Classic too.
---
Grind mobs your same level, its faster and you get less experience per kill if the mob is a higher level
---
It seems a significant mistake to release Dire Maul in Stage 1. Hopefully they reconsider. 
---
It's a funhouse and it's exploitable to a significant degree and that makes it fun after 6+ months but its presence is going to affect where we aim as we level and prepare to raid to the exclusion of other content. 
---
you dont get banned for griefing, unless you are constantly harassing the same person
---
The biggest thing for me was I didn't ask for the best heals or buffs.  Paladins where I come from smite evil, not stand in the back and watch others do it.  If they just called them Clerics I wouldn't have cared as much
---
Hey now, none of us knew wtf we were doing back then. My rogue was something weird like 20-14-17 until a class officer took me under his wing. 
---
Night Elves were doing this for a quest to loot a box near some furbolgs, had like 25 people in line on the day a private server had launched.

I stood there and spam clicked it. Took me 2 or 3 tries to beat the next person in line. Everyone was cussing at me for not standing in their line, and insisting that I was now blacklisted and would never be able to get in a raiding guild. I think I got to like level 30 before a new private server came out and everyone rerolled on it instead.

Was pretty funny how invested everyone was in their names on a very obviously temporary server.
---
Streamers arent a danger to the servers. They may bring hangers on but overall there ilk isnt going to do anything more than bring people to them when they stream. 
---
The real issue is the major gaming groups that still exist coming over and picking a server and basically saying "This is our server" SA and of course Reddit come to mind as the large groups of people that i would be most worried about. On the other hand a streamer like asmogold will have the people that flock to him they on some level are still going to have to level and play the game which will leave out any but the most sycophantic types of people. SA and Reddit could just take over a leveling zone or for example become the Devilaur mafia on shear numbers alone. This was something that happened back in Vanilla and a great number of older mmos as it related to SA Goons

I’m planning to go Encrusted Surf Crawler (rank 2 Claw right by Org) -&gt; Savannah Huntress (level 11 Cat right by Xroads) -&gt; Needles Cougar (level 27 Cat 1.2 speed all over Thousand Needles, right around the time you want speed for Frenzy). Anything other than that is too much time investment for a leveling pet, I’ll try for specific shit with big respawn timers after 60.

Nixxiom wnd ragtag are 2 eu streamers..so yea
---
&gt;But everyone likes to cry that they don't get to do all this AND also do as much dmg as a warrior...
---
While I don't really care if Vanilla is going to be balanced or not, I do think you're missing the point a lot of people are making. I don't think a majority of the people interested in balancing are asking for Warrior'ish damage, but rather somewhat acceptable DPS, which Paladins flat out don't have. There's definitely a sweet spot between doing the same damage as a Warrior and doing literally 50% +- of what they're doing.
---
I have always been a proponent of the original cap. Like, always. Please don't spread misinformation.
---
yeah because it's illegal to change your mind on reddit, I forgot about that law
---
Didn't only Org have an AH at launch? I mean, I remember doing the same thing but I didn't start until something like 1.9.
---
What about the ones that don't like warriors? Have fun farming anything as prot warrior, or end up spending 100g to spec arms/fury and then back to prot again.
---
I don't think that'll happen on such a large scale as it did back then.
---
The majority is going to have: bigger resolutions than back then, better Addons and just in general better understanding of what addons are needed. There's a rise in 'simplistic' addons.
---
You get more exp from a mob a higher level, but the relation between effort and exp is bad for most classes. Base exp level is 100% for same level and increases with the level difference up and down. But you know, harder to hit, more HP, more inc DMG etc. So yes killing mobs of your Level is most efficient.

Because they were some pro hunters, knew how to trap and have pets off tank during gigantic trash packs. (Ran with two hunters a priest and a rogue.)
