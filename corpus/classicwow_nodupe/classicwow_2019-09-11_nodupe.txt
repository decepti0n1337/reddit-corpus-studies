As a warrior main for years I rolled rogue this time, but who knows what the future holds, I might make a warrior.

Exactly what you describe here is what makes classic as brilliant as it is. This game brings people together, people don't care about getting to 60 in a rush, or get epic drops, people adventure, do fun stuff, walk for 30 minutes to get new hands from a quest reward. I find it amazing the way you describe how you felt last night and I hope you, and we all will get more of these moments through out azeroth.
---
Ah, makes sense. As a lock, I wish I had a buff I could give when people give me stamina.
---
Nah. Anyone that plays fps's rebinds a and d to strafe, q and e to spells. There is no reason to have turn keys when you can turn with your mouse.

i think you have to reloadui after getting new ranks to fix macros. or put ranks in the macros themselves.

God I wouldn't know dude. Vanilla Gold was a different beast then the later xpac's. Buying your 40 mount a feat, buying your Epic mount....you felt God tier for sometime. Now I remember playing Vanilla but I couldn't tell you the Enchant prices. It varied greatly dependent on the enchant, how hard it was to farm said enchant recipe and also how hard it was to get the mats.
---
If you wanna get an idea, look up what is required just to farm the Crusader enchant.
---
I used to use gyazo and got annoyed when people shit talked it but seriously, switch to ShareX it's so much bette.r

Because half of it was a copied from Return of the King. Not saying it was bad or copying was bad, but at least give credit to the OG that is Tolkien.

My favourite is somewhere in between the Vanilla trailer, the WotLK one, and the Warcraft III cutscenes, but I can't decided yet.
---
Classic always was for casuals. Ask eq players.
---
But wtf is bad about being a casual?

We dont have real res but honestly, we have enough heals to last a whole 5-6 mob pulls or a boss (plus innervate is op), battle res can also be useful especially in critical moments. Since there is always that one man that SHOULDN'T die (except us healers) in a group in order to win a pull. Although I do understand the pain cuz i main resto druid and ppl in my guild does say resto druids are shitty... but, if we play our cards right, we top any healer out there :P RESPECT TO ALL RESTO DRUIDS
---
They're pretty decent quality. Washing them you just can't put them in the dish washer and gently washing them with a rag is harmless.
---
You think a regular ass thing, is a bug, and youre bitching like a retail baby. Yeah man, youre an idiot through and through. I wasn't "resorting" to name calling. It was the only appropriate response.
---
The sails in bfa aren reflected either i think
---
ok let me adress this.
---
I dont think speech can opress anyone, opression is a strong word.
---
I feel like we shouldnt compare people (and children) speaking online with authoritarian governments (like china or nazi germany)
---
You weaken the meaning behind opression, if you call every little thing opression. (its like the boy who cries wolf, maybe lets only call opression where it actually happens, like in china or other parts of the world)
---
To the thing about slurs=government putting people in jail, you are right the US government does not do that right now.
---
(Im from germany, here insulting a person verbally is actually AGAINST the law and u may have to pay him for his damage in return if he feels hurt)
---
But when it comes to places like twitter or facebook or other private platform that are being used by more people then any public platform is.
---
They can apply their own Laws and Rules.
---
If you say the N-word (or F or R word)
---
You get banned in World of Warcraft and on twitter (idk about facebook)
---
And i feel like a permanent ban for those words, is actually just one step behind "jail", you suspend peoples accounts permanently for speech.
---
The last thing, which to me proves my point (at least abit)
---
Is how much you over react in your satirical comment at the end.
---
I just said i think you are on the wrong side.
---
No reason to compare THAT to a gas chamber or shit like that.
---
What do you say or compare north korean concentration camps to if u already get that worked up about my comment?
---
You want to have a safe space for everyone. 
---
In that process you dont care how much you have to discriminate, insult, hurt or attack people who are against you.
---
To me thats the definition of any authoritarian (fascist) regime.
---
If we arent careful your persuit of a safe world, destroy equality in the world.
---
If we truely are all equal, everyone should be able to say anything.
---
And you should not be able to forbid me any words (otherwise i could just forbid you the words that trigger me) 
---
And there is nothing that should give you power over me (or me power over you)
---
So just think about what world you want to live in.
---
A free one or a orpressed one, in which you get banned from all platform if you dont watch your speech.
---
(and it could go to an extreme where new rules come faster then u can learn them, and u simply dont know about those, spastic for example does not seem at all like a triggering word to me if im honest)
---
If you have any disability i really feel very sorry for you and i hope the world and modern medicine can help it (soon) 
---
But you really shouldnt try to forbit other people their speech.
---
We all free people and we all gotta accept that fact.

---
his retail boast was shit but I don’t see any keyboard warrior talk?
---
You can definitely AOE/speed-tank in Vanilla, I know because I did it.  
---
When you pull, taunt your primary target and then ignore it.  Let the DPS go bonkers on it (it will really get their pixels hard if you know what I mean).  Spend your time managing the others.  Blood rage, revenge spam, sunder and shouts - tab+spam.  All the mobs are gonna die.  You only need to focus on protecting the healer in most cases, because when the DPS pulls threat (which they will) the healer will go ham to save them usually, thus pulling aggro themselves.  
---
You should be ready to pull as soon as the healer is ready to go.  Essentially, tanking an instance is like driving a car.  You let the DPS get off on killing the current pack, you should already have eyeballed the next pack and determined who to target first.
---
I used to start in battle stance, pull, blood rage, clap, def stance, demo shout and cleave.  Tab+spam sunder, etc.  Eventually you parry and dodge more with gear and talents then your revenge spam will go off the hook and you'll have no problem.
---
I think if you get over that "i'm the wall that defends my party" mentality that a lot of new tanks have, you will have more fun and have less friction with players.  DPS know that if they pull threat that they could end up dead, and most of them have mechanics to mitigate that, let them use that stuff when they screw up.  Low level instances are not serious business and shouldn't be frustrating to you.  If your party can handle the pull, let them.  You're literally a team of 5 people spending an equal amount of time on something, you gotta find middle ground - that goes for you and them.
---
Don't give up, just lighten up.  If the instance party sucks, leave and go back to questing - no one can force you to stay.  Alternatively, just straight up say "I'm not interested in aoe/cleave" if that's a deal breaker for them then at least you sorted that before you got to the instance.  But I think rerolling is a bit dramatic.  Good luck!
---
&gt;I am looking for a semi-balanced population and queue times around 1-2k
---
Do we tell him?
---
I don't spend any money on food. I always start my questing day by asking for 40 x conjured food from a mage in SW/IF. If I can't find one quickly I use food I gained through grinding. The bandages I use are the ones I needed to make for skill-up anyway.
---
I don't need demo shout for tanking leveling instances. Sweeping Strikes + 2H tanking while weaving taunts/MB works just fine. Maybe it's needed if you run with three mages AoE:ing, but I don't go out of my way to run that comp.
---
No, I didn't mean Blood Craze. I'm level 35 full Arms with 5/5 Tactical mastery. I meant Bloodrage, which is used to stay in combat to preserve rage, combined with bandage to make an immediate new pull possible.
---
And also, even accounting for the missed rage from the white auto-attack, HS is still more effective in terms of damage/rage compared to TC.
---
To be honest all servers are heavy horde in NA, I’d suggest staying alliance but finding a better server for sure...Fairbanks is nice, insta wines mostly peak hours an hour maybe and hour and a half if you’re unlucky
---
"God bless us, every one"

Of course

Currently a level 15 Night Elf Priest. tend to play all day long and would love to have a leveling partner. as a priest using Holy spec damage is pretty lacking so solo leveling is a bit tough. would love to have someone to roll with till the eventual goal of 60 and beyond. feel free to add on Discord @ Jokerlolz#4696
---
Have a good one :)
---
ah gotcha how do i set up a modifer is that something i can do in the base game or do i gotta get an add on?
---
I'd go a step further, and say it's not even to keep everyone alive, but to perform enough healing to allow the group to complete the content. Especially in raid content, there will be triage decisions that require tactically letting someone die.  It's not so apparent in 5 mans, but sometimes letting a dps die will save you enough resources to keep the tank alive.
---
This made me laugh pretty hard, my wife just woke up :')
---
I think it would be significantly better as a main hub for players compared to stormwind, at least in an aesthetics sense. It’s very open design would be awesome to be able to look across the way and see tons of players in the other part of the city.
---
I think the reason there are people asking for TBC and WotLK are really simple. More people played them than Vanilla. It is no surprise that people want to play the version of the game they started with.
---
I've been trying to get this for so long... Let me know if you manage to find a way
---
Meanwhile I sold  5 stacks of briarthorn instead of leveling alchemy and got a few gold in the bank
---
how much does it hit for?
---
All that you've said I experienced and also enjoyed, but now at 40+ that old amazing rub has kind of come off which I felt 10-35. But playing slower is definitely I'm going to do moving forward.
---
Those people roll druids
---
Holy comments, I was going to read through until I saw how many there were. It was a pleasure killing the alliance at first, we messed up when our raid leader told us to go to Redridge. We should have stayed in duskwood.
---
Look forward to future battles!
---
I’ve used it 5 times and all were almost exactly 1k. Which is weird, not even close to PServer hits. pServers were 300-who knows what. Sometimes 3k
---
Because if people took 2 seconds to Google "record gameplay on windows" and 10 seconds to download a program (shareX) they would be doing it quicker than they would on their phone...sharex even automatically uploads it for you. If you take a video of your computer on your phone you are lazy.
---
Man people on here are so dumb. Just because they shouldn't take damage doesn't mean they don't and that you should only heal them in emergencies. Like it's the "principle" of the thing? 
---
Same type of person as the smug tanks back in the day, where if someone aggros they just let them die
---
Sure let me leave the entire party at 50%, so if the tank loses aggro for one second the DPS can get one shot. Fucking idiots circle jerking over a moronic thread lmao 
---
Especially in dungeons, you guys know you can drink while the tank pulls right? 
---
Glad most of you guys are still questing in Westfall :)
---
Here's an actual PSA: Unless you're actually going to go oom before the pack / boss dies - try topping everyone off.
---
Wanted to get into a new game.
---
Babies who want loot hallways hate Gnomer,ST,BRD, etc.
---
Not on Paladins at least.
---
Flash of Light is spammable even at the highest rank you have, with a very nice mana/health ratio.
---
Pala healing in dungeons is just wait for them to get low-ish, then spam Flash until full, then do nothing until you have regen enough to do it over again
---
This has a converse though.  Mana remaining is unused healing.  It doesn't really matter yet, but one sign of a bad healer is being more conservative with their mana so they don't need to use consumables.
---
you are a godless heretic. Be glad you don't play on Failrina, or it wouldn't matter how many of Asmun's garbage Empire of Man knockoff's you bring, we'll still steamroll you.
---
was a fun read though :)
---
It's faster to just grind dungeons if all you care about is xp/hr.

This is crazy
---
Say it isn't so, father!

Renew is actually kind of inefficient in terms of heals from what I remember.

I agree. I an lvl 32 on my main and I made a Dwarf warrior last night. Got the Warrior to lvl 8 then sent him some green boe gear from the ah on my main. The dwarf is pretty tough for a lvl 9 now. 
---
Doing this for a warrior when your main is at 60 would be a great idea.
---
While I'm not disagreeing with you, I didn't make the rule here. I started calling BFA retail because everyone else was to differentiate between the 2.

---
On this note, the timer for the 5 second rule begins when the cast lands and not begins.  There's nothing wrong (actually you should be doing this if you have a long cast heal) with starting the cast, only to interrupt it if it's not required.

I've heard there's a few twinks happy to  help you get on top.

Excuse me! Did you create/manage this guide ?? 
---
I have been using a real old archived forum post, somebody wrote out in steps Joana's 1-60 Horde guide (not 100% exact but decent). I noticed it takes some interesting paths, quest completion orders etc etc.  
---
After a quick glance through  [https://classicwow.live/leveling](https://classicwow.live/leveling)  (your site....?!) I noticed that the paths and questing rotation seemed way more... fluid?   
---
(for example, doing RFC at 15 as orc hunter and then exiting Org through ashenvale to get FP and northern barrrens quests done, where joana had you hearth back then accept and half complete certain quests and ... yeah just way more unusual) 
---
Anyway I guess what I'm trying to get at here is , recommend abandoning Joana's 1-60 and picking up from  [https://classicwow.live/leveling](https://classicwow.live/leveling) ? I like what I have seen so far and the nice looking UI is a bonus

Good job if this is your creation.. Don't know what that other guy was complaining about

Leatrix Plus - vender greys, repairs automatically, and there’s an option to auto dismount when trying to attack which is my favourite part, along with many other great options and very simple to use 
---
Mapster - smaller map
---
Omni CC - buff and debug timers 
---
ClassicAuraDurations - a must need paired with Omni CC, but you might have to download it the old fashioned way (ie not through twitch app as I couldn’t find it there, but still works with classic)
---
TradeSkillMaster - AH tracker, money log, etc, —-just /tsm scan with the ah open to get all updated prices of items, you can be extremely useful and can be extremely profitable with not much set up.

AtlasLoot - shows all dungeon and raid loot like the live dungeon journal

Wrath was arguably the most popular expac, the game peaked in early Cata in terms of subs but (IMO) that was largely because of the hype from wrath.

# which class should i choose for the social aspects of the game? mage or priest?
---
Hello world)! I have played late game of BK and passed full content of Lich King, later, I have stopped to play at the cataclysm. I am a native russian speaker and for several months i have been learning english. My language control is extremely bad and I want to play on EN servers in order to learn the language faster and with some fun) Due to this fact, I am trying to decide which class would be better for me.
---
On the one hand, Mage can cast some food and open portals as well as make a significant damage in PVE and PVP. But, as damage dealer, I think, it would be harder to be taken to some raids and groups, which will be reflected to my social contacts in game (for practising english).
---
On the other hand, priest can heal and be always usefull for raids and groups, while his equipment for shadow spec is limited by priorities for mages and warlocks. Owing this fact, it will be hard for me to fight and I am afraid that the game will be boring. This post was written without dictionaries and translators, in the light of this circumstance, sorry for my english. What are your opinion about that issue )????
---
BTW, what do you think about tailoring and enchanting as main professions? would be other professions better?
---
That’s my biggest complaint too; can’t seem to fix.

charge should give you rage based on distance traveled, so a longer charge gives you more for when you actualy get to the fight.

that’s sick man, as someone who mained rogue for a long time this makes me happy, just started up my rogue, hoping to hit 15 today. :) glad you’re enjoying classic

No

If i was a new player and saw a infernal. That would basically be a epic moment for me. Would be like woooooah wtf is happening???

Oh, glad to learn that FD trap is messed up. I thought I was doing something horribly wrong. I tried all the macros and failed, then talked to a vanilla hunter who told me he never used any back in the days and could go FD trap without any problem, so I tried that and failed again.
---
Well, I don't really immerse myself into the roleplay like that. First and foremost, I'm playing a game with other people, so I do my best to be nice to those other people. What the specific lore of the game says is secondary to me.
---
I love throwing buffs. Fort, spirit, shadow prot, hell, I'll even toss in a fear ward. I end up rolling with all sorts of buffs from everyone.

That's classic for ya.

I am a priest and new to the game and I had no idea. Wasn't sure why the Warlock was always low on health and why I had to keep healing them.

Windfury (totem) has a 20% chance to proc off of each attack, *including specials*. One weapon swing is one roll of that die regardless of whether it's white or a heroic strike swing. Any additional attacks (MS, hamstring, sunder, etc.) will be an extra chance for windfury to trigger.
---
Thus if your choice is "use this 15 rage on heroic strike or use this 15 rage on sunder," the second option will give you an extra chance at a windfury proc. Hopefully this made more sense as I'm not sure how else to put it.
---
FWIW, NeatPlates includes enemy cast bar, debuff tracking, and threat indicators all-in-one. You can also use the default blizzard theme if that's your thing.
---
Couple things
---
1) You don't see anything for the pickpocket because it happens so fast. You gotta listen for the money loot sound or watch for it in chat. 
---
2) Make sure you aren't moving when you hit it because this makes it not work sometimes. You can't be moving too fast for pickpocket
---
3) I just noticed it's called "Pick Pocket" so you need to put that instead of pickpocket (no quotes)

Look up a proper spec, hint you want all first 41 points in arms then fury. And then respec. Make sure you only buy spells you truly need, there's a lot of rank1 wonders.
---
There might be but it would only be for your own benefit... and you'd already know you died once if that's as high as you plan on letting a counter go.  No one else could verify your claim.  If there was an addon that tracked it you could have the addon disabled... do tough quests maybe dying and then turn the counter back on so when finished.  No way to do this as a non humble brag and have no doubts it is legitimate.  You'll have to just do it for you, not gonna get high 5's for that achievement.

Hey look! Stormx!
---
Ratchet is a horde town where the players are the guards.
---
You're obviously in the minority, have you seen how many pvp servers there are compared to pve?
---
You're fine.  Most warriors respec at 40 anyway to Arms if they were something else.  One point isn't going to gimp you into obscurity.
---
Underwater breathing....it ain't much, but its honest work. Fr tho, any water quest is god awful without water breathing or being undead
---
A big issue with AAA and MMOs is that AAA publishers think anything that brings in less than a million players is a waste....meanwhile, UO and EQ were considered successes at launch with 10's of thousands.  Eve Online has 20-40k concurrent players, typically leaning towards 20k, and there's a lot of multiboxing going on(not to mention it is semi F2P now).  AAA expectations can only be met by bringing in the casual crowd, which dwarfs players that like pvp sandboxes.  
---
Concerning third person - for me third person wasn't traditional,  UO was top down and Meridian59 and EQ were first person(EQ had the option for third, but most people playing early on were doing first person).  So third person isn't a requirement for me for a major MMO.  Albion has every system Eve has bar the titan/super level of construction - that being said, Albion isn't a perfect game and has it's flaws.  I'd like to point out the other quality sandbox pvp MMO games I have on my list from the kickstarters that happened ~5 years ago but most haven't released in to beta yet - albion to its credit has.
---
if your healing anyone other than the tank your playing classic wrong
---
That has nothing to do with spellcleave unless you were a full mage group.
---
Yeah 1g ain’t bad. I respecd my mage at lvl 26 cause I messed up my AoE talents. When you run SM you’ll get gear that sells for 1-3g. So 1g isn’t anything.
---
Goto his official site, both of the UI are available. Also Shestak UI is available which in my opinion is the tits.
---
Thank you! Think this will help a lot! Don't see it unless I'm missing it but is keeping only being able to see quests only 2 levels lower okay? Or will I lose out on exp towards endgame?
---
30s? The rune alone is 20s haha
---
ohh my sweet summer child.
---
Smolderweb ftw! Still populated as a mofo
---
Yea I guess people don't like sitting around waiting for the pull haha, but if you look at the numbers It is definitely worth it!
---
What is HF mana breaks?
---
Very badass!
---
You can hear people stealth from a certain distance.. you can see it in logs if you have them up, ofc.  This addon has a HUGE range for it.  I get you are trying to be sarcastic about it, but it seems like it defeats the purpose of world pvp, ganking, etc.  You can target people who are nearby lol.. wihtout having a visual on them.. You don't think that is broken?
---
What rank does it have to be because I use it on my self at rank 1 and I see nothing
---
Gonna need a sample of the goods.
---
I've hit a wall too unfortunately. I haven't logged in yesterday or today because when I do, I just look at my quests and can't be bothered. It doesn't help to not have people to play with to keep me motivated. I'm hoping a break will spark my interest again.
---
Nope Moonkin has really bad mana management, in pve you pretty much spam 1 thing, in pvp you use roots and moonfire.
---
Love it. Everything I was looking for in a server. I hear faction balance is pretty sweked in favor of Horde, but hasn't been an issue for me yet (cough stv).
---
What I was looking forward to that
---
What was the name though
---
i've done jump charges like that a lot
---
I don't recall what rank I used, sorry.
---
Are you enjoying the rogue?  This class has never appealed to me.  However, I could see myself making one on a PvP server and having alot of fun... Maybe...
---
Character notes is a great addon for this.
---
You don't know how satisfying it is to group with someone and be like "I've always got time to help someone that fights with honour" or to be like "wait, didn't you steal a chest from me in the barrens at lvl 12? Yeah you're gonna have to do this elite quest on your own".
---
I wish you could make notes of the other faction though, after last night on shimmering flats I have a list of alliance that get mercy and people I will mother fucking corpse camp if I ever get the chance.
---
You know who you are cowardly group of 5 that only engaged in 5v1s and ran back to your lvl 40+'s any time the fight started approaching remotely fair.
---
/s ?
---
Druid here, running through mobs to get to town in cat form worh 30% extra move speed.
---
Dudes on the road see and heal me and get aggro... Now I have a choice to make, and it sucks.
---
Thanks! I've had it put away in a box for YEARS. But no longer, the Paladin came out for Classic. It needs repairs (mainly glue) but love it.
---
I'm pretty sure that got changed in vanilla, I'll check the patch notes when I get a chance
---
When then I'd better not tell you where the lemonade is made
---
Sweet lemonade
---
Yeah sweet lemonade
---
You want it back as it was? Then fine, they take the servers down tomorrow for good? You don't want any changes, some of the changes relate to security as well and legally they can't release it without these updates in the EU, NA, or AUS territories that I know of.
---
Don’t think you can use it anymore outside team zone
---

I love jumping off hills and engaging, then watching my guy go flying through the air like an absolute madman.
---
Gg noggens
---
Fyi lesser heal is superseeded by heal, use lower ranks of heal for better mana efficiency.
---
I assume you don't press it though, because it does next to no healing at your level.
---

Depending on your weapon speed, heroic strike is usually worse DPR than *hamstring*, without even accounting for the fact that hamstring gives you an extra overpower proc chance.
---
my moneys on something terrible
---
you can charge in the air
---
sry pic didnt work. think i fixed it
---
World PvP, tanking, etc doesn't have a purpose though lmao. Literally just people trying to steamroll people way weaker than them or while they're at 4% fighting mobs
---
What was the name of the epic Hunter bow you had to get pieces of, and had to do MC? I remember grinding out for that thing. I was the first on my server to get it back in the day. I was so proud.
---
Rogue must be at least wice your level.
---
Nope i was actually using bartender but just spent 2 hours on remaking how my setup looks. You might want to use dominos, it’s a great way to setup action bars easily
---
I C wut you did thur
---
As another human warrior, this was a great story.
---
No, it was bugged and the numbers were wrong. You do know we still had datamining back then right? That's not a new things. We knew what things were supposed to do when we found no viable way to stop it. Do you want to be punted to the cieling at random by tentacles? Cause it's really hilarious getting instakilled with absolutely 0 chance to dodge. Oh look, the fixed it and now it does a pushback that matched what it was said to do in the files.. oh wow.
---
Anything frost for mages also, most level frost and aoe with blizzard and cone of cold.
---
My hero!
---
It's not true WoW Classic if you're not on a 2004 Dell desktop with Windows XP and several viruses
---
dagger build is fun in pvp and even not bad in dungeons but for questing and random shot out in the world I love rolling swords and combat.
---
Not a bug, it’s a feature. Going to call it sneak attack: feint in a future patch.
---
It may be less efficient, but it does cost less if someone just needs a small top off, that's only reason it's on there.
---
I don't know but they must have a very fancy steady cam setup!
---
thats my point. if salty players are allowed to just report ppl and make a bot change their names...
---
What server
---
Do you get it? Rolling alliance is somehow gay and gay people scare OP
---
+1 for Apache OpenOffice. Great program suite.
---
And is that nearly as helpful for a group that consistently plays together...?
---
That is litteraly what you are doing. Wasting your time over things that have zero meaning.
---
Yes it is, it's nice to see people in the world and have people group up for hard quests. I hate questing in ashenvale but it makes it a little bit easier if you group with someone for some of the quests
---
And if you get lucky someone will be getting pushed through low level dungeons by a higher level guildy and can join them
---
Skeram
---
well the undead used to be humans
---
Incendius has been great. 1200 peak queue is like 20 minutes, it's one of the most  full servers with almost no queue any more.

For a world drop yes, if they are in the right level range they have a chance to drop the staff.  A very small chance but still can keep you hopeful.  Good luck though!  Hope you snag it.
---
It doesn't have a purpose? That's what made vanilla actually great.. player interaction at all levels.  Sounds like you been getting ganked a lot.. Welcome to PvP servers.  Not everyone fighting in the world is waiting for you to be low to kill you.. Some will engage on you when you are full because fighting someone else is just fun.. Regardless, your post doesn't add anything to the root of the conversation.

I would be amazed if he can make it onto a ledge like that with no running path. It’s not the same as travelling up an unreachable point on a hill, but maybe he can \_( ‘ ‘ )_/
---
this is the first popular easter egg in all of WoW
---
amazing people are just discovering it
---
It is the name of a band though and blizz actually has something about real life VIPs and companies in their TOS iirc, if nobody cares, nothing happens, but renaming was always relieng on people snitching.
---
Yeah I'm an arachnophobe too but in game spiders look nothing much like real spiders.
---
but of the 2 options for now, which would be better?
---
This is why you are an ally
---
When I commented the image was missing / broken
---
You can be boring and go human, be a complete piece of shit and go NE Huntard. Or play a real race and go Horde
---
But if you really don't want to keep at ravager I'd go with the slower weapon
---
What UI addon is this?
---
keybinds means muscle memory which can sometimes make it harder for people who play less, forgettinf what buttons your spells are on is usually only possible for consecutive players. people who play maybe a few hes a week dont have time to remember keys so clicking is easier. 
---
also if you arent pvping you usually dont need to use keybinds, as most pve content is just standing still with the very very very rare strafe
---
Gehennas eu
---
I pull when people who aren't the healer are drinking because you can finish drinking while everyone else is fighting. It's a small efficiency.

Run Uldaman at 44 (could go as low as 42 depending on your group) to get the mace from the final boss.

Also, which damage meter is that? Please don’t say “details”

Forgot to ask..when to start using mind flay when leveling as shadow?
---
You can turn them down. The main difference is resolution.

meh I don’t rely on it in dungeons because  people generally don’t listen and if they do they don’t understand

I hope you're right and they aren't!

 Taking that as an insult shows how incredibly soft your skin is.

Battlegrounds aren't out yet, and you will have to go to each battleground to queue when they launch, same with instances, this is classic

Feel free to add me. I'm currently level 15 Priest but haven't only started last night. So hopefully I'll be there soon.
---
As  a Resto Druid with Omen of Clarity I do this a lot, too. Getting those sweet OoC procs means I can do a big heal while still regenerating mana, honestly even one proc per pack makes an insane difference.
---
At least you dont have 6 Alliance level 40's wrecking everyone in hillsbrad. I dont mind PVP hell i love it but when people go into a 20-31 zone and they ?? it really makes the game not worth playing. Just shows they can PVP people their level so they gotta kill lower level players
---
Yeah idk what the addon is in classic. Not sure it exists currently
---
Yeah, I leveled one in vanilla, leveling another now though he's still in his teens. Moonfire spamming is pretty much the least Mana efficient thing you can do.
---
Keep moonfire dot up, then Wrath spam for dps or Starfire spam for mana efficiency is the basic rotation.
---
Oh, sweet summer child
---
I mean, they were all already at Deadmines except for my brother and I. And my brother said he would summon me when he met the group. He was going to beat me to the dungeon anyway if I had started walking right away. I thought it was going to save time. I didn't realize the group had no interest in meeting outside the instance. Not sure a group with that priest and mage would  have been successful anyway since they seemed so anti-group in the first place.
---
isn’t the lore that it’s an undead city because it was theirs before they were wiped out from plague?
---
Spirit Tap but yes, should let the priest wand someone left on 50hp whereever possible. Even if they just drink afterwards it's still a nice boost to  lower downtime.
---
no. regular pvp server
---
The addon lets you target people who aren't in your screen.. people who you cannot see.  Even if behind a tree or hill or whatever you can still target them..
---
Also who wants to wait 2 hours to get their box back when anyone in a major city will orgasm just for the free skill point for picking it for you?  Holler in town for rogue with 125 picking for a box and watch 5 whisper you quick or just throw you invites to find you fast.
---
I‘m sorry to hear that. I read the ticket twice before i saw it, somehow skipped the part first time so i thought this might help later readers out.
---
I picked it up, but it doesn't allow outgoing damage to appear on target correct?
---
i can post a video but in gnomer on my warrior i was able to jump to the lower part of the city (after zoning) and there are mobs on the ground, roughly same distance as this BRM jump
---
if you charge a mob while mid-air you will stick to a wall and charge it, path doesnt really matter when falling
---
It's called spirit tap btw
---
It's definitely cool!  I've been a PC gamer for 20 years, but just never got into WoW.  So it's crazy to have this backwards way of seeing it all for the first time.
---
Battlegrounds aren’t out yet I don’t think, but you’ll probably be able to access them through NPCs in SW and Org. Dungeons you have to run to. No queuing. You find groups by talking in chat.
---
Worst thing they ever did was add the instant que for dungeons and battleground
---
Nah man. They’re both really valuable. Honestly you’ll probably be able to make more money with alchemy than tailoring end game. People only need one piece of gear, but they need lots of pots and herbs
---
Have a trap laid out in front of the healer, Feign Death if they are coming for you.
---
Apparently an NPC with the last lastname Kennedy, probably why it isn't working
---
Yea, true.  I try to time it myself.  I feel your pain on this though.

Yep, Pala tank/ DPS and Priest DPS are always attractive options for a Druid on Alliance :D
---
You Chose the wrong faction in character creation.
---
Idk about that. The battle masters are already in the game. But you’re right, they aren’t out yet

Actually, the Titans were there before the trolls and had already created some titan-forged before the trolls even came into being, its true that the trolls are native to Azeroth but the Titans arrived first

Highly doubting that blizz designed content to be "intentionally impossible". Why even do that? If they intended for it to be impossible, why even let players fight him?
---
Did the same,  did all 3 sets of charms thinking of have too many fire but everything sold no matter what anyways.  The elemental fires from the burny guys makes them the best though.  Problem is competition for those mobs.

The two times I got ganked happened in Ashenvale. The first one he just walked by, wrecked me and left. The second time he looked like he was about to set up camp so I spirit rezzed and went to Wetlands haha.
---
Your interface is so butchered it‘s only slightly below vanilla raiding tear, amazing 😂😂😂
---
So many times I hope these players are just kids, but deep down I know they’re probably older than me.
---
Exactly, you surprise them by being in the place they least expect it.
---
Honestly we just kinda killed the fuck out of him. Granted it was a whole group of 24+
---
Because he was doing the better jump down without 2 points of fall damage to go to a dungeon and didn't really care about killing the 33 shaman to much?
---
Sounds like you are mad.  I am not whining, I am just saying it shouldn't be legal for rogues or druids.  But judging from your post you can simply tell how immature you are..  Which confirms what I said earlier, you been ganked a lot.. and it's understandable if your skill level is subpar to the rest, I don't blame you.  Gl getting out of STV.
---
piss off

Just got mine today at 17! So excited :D

Lmao when i started getting sores on my elbows i started doing this. Thought i was alone!
---
Nah, that was in Cata. In BC your rep tabards were just regular tabards that looked cool. You had to be exalted for them too.
---
I don't think the scourge that were with the banshee queen when they broke from the lich's grasp were all Lordaeronians from memory.
---
Hypothetically if you have a group to do it and can summon  then yes.
---
 This was about solo questing. It's better to do a grinding quest than this fetch quest.
---
W
---
Up to hotw in feral, up to nature's swiftness in resto. You can fill all the roles in dungeons and solo quest with ease. Once 60 you can do whatever you want.
---
Everyone plays differently. Most people i have encountered want to get through it as fast as possible dont. Maybe try and find people who want to take it slow rather than just random people.
---
We must just be used to good healers?
---
Thing is, by the time you get to Icecrown it's far too late. Classes are homogenized, everyone is flying around at the speed of sound to grind their dailies, if it's true "nochanges" then group finder is in, store mounts are in, gear and stats have started to be stripped away and dumbed down to the point of gearscore emerging, we've got raid modes/sizes instead of different raids for different groups, etc etc. WOTLK is far too late for a split off, it might as well be retail at that point.
---
What kind of idiot Huntard doesn't want more mana regen over melee damage? If you're in melee range you're playing Hunter wrong.
---
Its orc rock mountain, the hordes 4th capital. Normal to see low levels there
---
Yeah, honestly I really would like to keep most of Classic's layout. I've just had so many people tell me that ElvUI has positively changed their game experience. And I tried it a while back and had a hard time adapting so i just shut it down and uninstalled the addon.
---
But I love everything about your setup. I will say that having all buttons from your action bars centered like you (and most people with an ElvUI setup) have is beneficial and I find myself wishing mine were like that.
---
It’s worth it if you’re one of the people who knows you’re not in it for the long haul.
---
I am this guy. Not the exact guy but same mindset. I'd rather wait 30 mins and get a group that rolls through and play for 3-4 hours with that group than some rag tag group that doesn't synergise and struggles to do more than 2 mobs at a time. Last thing I want is to run a spellcleave group and get a tank who will only pull 2 - 3 mobs at a time.
---
Hot tip if you want to go slow, mess around, rp or w/e. Just form your own group. All the power too you. If you join a dedicated grinding group that is going for exp as fast as possible guess what, you're the asshole holding everyone else up.

Lvl 18 ne here got mine by luck somone summoned Eche and just left, took hours
---
I’d love to try it out to be honest. Dunno really where to start tho.
---
Thank you for not being toxic. I might have hastily replied assuming the standard toxicity I've been met with in this thread, misinterpreting it's subject entirely and judging accordingly. I did not do raid content during actual Vanilla, and I haven't gotten there yet in Classic. So I have no subjective substance to provide.  
---
What I'm proposing here is not to bring back what was broken or bugged. Nor do I propose progressive itemization or balance changes. What I'm proposing is to revert the *nerfs* that occurred throughout Vanilla to these raids as catch-up mechanics. These nerfs can be found in the link I provided to the summary. A few examples:
---
&gt;Onyxia’s fireballs will no longer result in a confuse effect (Engulfing Flames)  
---
&gt;Risen Aberration health and damage reduced.  
---
&gt;The creature spell, Call of the Grave, has had its damage reduced by half.  
---
&gt;Slowed the rate at which High Priestess Arlokk’s panthers spawn
---
&gt;Reduced the melee damage of High Priestess Mar’li.
---
&gt;Hakkar: Melee damage reduced.
---
&gt;The hitpoints of every creature in the General Rajaxx encounter has been lowered.
---
&gt;Damage of General Rajaxx has been lowered.
---
&gt;Reduced the damage dealt by the Sul’lithuz Abomination and Sul’lithuz Sandcrawler.
---
&gt;Reduced the overall damage of High Priest Thekal.
---
It was not. Being uninhibited by terrain makes almost any trip faster.
---
I do play with a guild, but I find guilds fill up with people who can commit more time to game.  Who i ran with 2 nights ago are already 10+ levels ahead of me so now i'm playing with their alts.
---
So were you too high level for the quest? The quests don’t really show up u less you’re at the right level
---
No path available
---
Heroic strike costs rage and replaces your auto attack so you lose an aa’s worth of rage. It’s been to spam sunder because it doesn’t replace your aa and thus increase dodge chances giving you more overpower procs. Heroic strike is largely used as a rage dump.
---
pretty sure this got changed in the vanilla beta or a very early patch b/c of griefing
---
That's good to know, thanks man.
---
They’re too afraid the DPS will pull first! :)
---
I personally prefer a slow 1h, Outlaw Sabre is a great weapon at that level for tanking with.  You get the big initial hit with the big threat right off the first attack and you still have a shield to absorb more dmg.
---
If you must 2h tank, it's still all about Sunder Armor since it is an instant attack.  Battle/Demo Shout are just for spreading around some AoE threat to keep stuff off the healer.
---
i can't imagine people back in the day wouldn't do this.  probably not in pugs as much but im sure skilled groups would.  if i had been playing an aoe class back in vanilla i would have wanted to figure out how to abuse it as well.
---
I thought there was a cap on the number of accounts you were allowed to have?
---
Play the game however you want to play it. It's a game.
---
Ah thank you
---
Hi, /u/Foritzio

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2hk22/general_chat_is_layered_which_means_one_could/). 
---
Dwarf Priest here.
---
I'm not OOM super often, but I do tend to shield a little too much during fights. It's a good way to stop someone from being buffeted by attacks and/or get some buffer time on a big heal, if Tank needs it. 
---
I'm really new to this healing thing, and mostly WoW in general, but my friends have told me I'm doing fine even if a DPS dies here and there. That's what I have a rez for. 
---
Also, look, if you're a DPS and you dont let Tank grab aggro before throwing a crazy DPS move, that's kinda your fault, man. 
---
I'm working on conserving mana, and not being so anal about keeping EVERYONE at 100%, because some of the fights really can get hectic if I start going below 35% mana or so.
---
All of this is from my low level experience in groups, of course. If I'm in your group and I'm not pulling my weight, just let me know. I'll do what I can to adapt. That's all I ask. Help me get better instead of leaving group in a huff after you pulled an extra room of ads when I was LOM.
---
Yes,  defensive stance adds a 1.3x modifier to threat generation.  You should charge change stance then shout.  This is where tactical mastery is useful.
---
It doesn't give you the current expansion, that's the one you have to buy unless they changed it.  It gives you the most recent expansion before current.  So level 110 instead of 120 is your max without buying bfa.
---
No its not up in the air. Healing  and spell crit are best stats for paladin.
---
just a s a follow up comment ive done scans of my computer just as a sannity check and came up with nothing.
---
This. I'm always trying to PvP with people around my level. Yes I want to gank you.
---
Ouch, but ok, I can understand =))
---
Healbot is a must. Pretty easy to set up, and extremely customizable.
---
I personally think it's bad that general chat is layered. If you want to find a group to do the STV quests it would be nice to be able to reach as many people as possible.
---
Cool UI. It's diablo-esque.
---
JohnnyBuckz#11955 Undead mage and my girl is undead priest. Would be nice to add a tank. We’re level 16-17
---
That's not true at all, and pseudo randomness is exploited CONSTANTLY in games. I don't know where you're getting that idea from.
---
It's as ridiculous as his "character or account" having something cheaty about it.
---
Faerlina has the most guilds that cleared MC and Ony
---
see i just let the alliance rogue get the guy down to 5% then i murdered him and took the kill
---
I noticed a massive increase in the number of people trying to kill the same mobs as me since the DDoS attacks. Not sure if just a coincidence or if they really did scale back the layers, but you aren’t the only one.
---
Look up ‘unbreakable shaman pvp’ you won’t be disappointed. Probably the most famous pvp video from vanilla wow. Enhancement shaman using hand of rag (legendary)
---
Wrath was peak as far as PVP balance and classes being equalized but not completely devoid of flavor yet. The only exceptions being Paladins and Death Knights were busted in PvP. And there may have been a rogue spec that was bad? I can't remember anything being unplayable in 80 raids.
---
Yep that’s stunning brb while I spend an hour or two reconfiguring my UI.
---
You're using the argument from fallacy right now, guess that means you're automatically wrong.
---
Sorry, your rules.
---
I could probably rank

Horde sucks! Come over to Alliance man! We have Kool-Aid!
---

---
Looks fine to me.
---
Arcanite Reaper and Earthfury definitely could use the help, but Heartseeker seems to actually be picking up momentum. Over the weekend even with the DDOS attacks it was peaking just over 1k for Alliance and high 800s to mid 900s Horde. With the additional servers opened up for transfers it will take only a small amount of people from each server to transfer to fill up the new servers.
---
Last night, I was running around killing some boars to level up 2H mace skill. I turned around, looked at my wife and said, "I'm safely in the forest...killing boars!" We laughed. I can't wait until Naxx when I can get "the sword of a thousand truths!"
---
You make a valid point. I've been playing MMOs before, perhaps I was too proud to think that I would be ok with playing a pre-made account even though I've played other games before. The game dynamics would always be different.
---
On stalagg it’s kill on sight mother fucker
---
I could basically do that with my old mouse (Logitech G600). It has 3 mouse buttons, left and right as well as another button to the right of the right mouse button. Furthermore, it has 12 buttons on the side. So, hold left and right click to move, rebind DPI keys to something else, and use the third mouse button as a modifier key to access another bar.
---
Dude idk how people do it I could not!! I be like this on the weekends when I ain’t got anything to do the next day and can only make it till about 2AM
---
Its all over Fight Club  discord

---
I have mostly had experienced players in dungeons but there has been a good mix. Definitely some tanks being taught LoS pulling for the first time etc.
---
I like it both ways to be honest, nice to have a smooth run but it is also a joy to be able to help others improve.
---
What?.. even in the botched retail lore the forsaken are still lordaeronians. There's even a short story where all the soldiers of the forsaken cant wait to charge the wall of gilneas and get trigger happy because of how they abandoned lordaeron in the 3rd war.
---
I love the forsaken because you're playing as lordaeron.
---
Seems they lowered the amount of layers on my server.  Could be wrong but it sure seems like there’s a lot more people cramped in the same areas.
---
You can see them through the combat log, just like the addon does. It works exactly the same as dps meters, threat meters, cast bars, and raid warnings do. You think every one of those is cheating too?
---
Thank you. Can I ask about the Badlands too? I tried to quest there and did enjoy that there was a good # of quests to do but... it's so hard to do them because there's SO many horde camping every spawn. Is that a horde-based zone as well that I should skip over? I'm currently 44 and the quests there are a good level for me but I got pretty stunted my last go-around
---
I'm late to this, but some classes really suck in Classic. You literally press two buttons in all PVE content. My finger almost fell off spamming Sinister Strike.
---
the slower? wouldnt the faster of the 2 give more windfury procs?
---
You can just abandon the quest and pick it up again. You'll get another horn.
---
I second this, moved from golemagg a couple of days ago. I've noticed a positive trend in terms of dragonfangs population. 
---
Let's keep it going!
---
"would of"? Seriously?
---
yea i put in a ticket but i dont know how serious they take those. but coming back to a game i havent played in 13 years and loving it again still. and i wanted to bring my old char back, but that wont work without the name. hoping if this gets a little support and traction on reddit someone who works for blizzard might see it and how stupid the reports were... so thank you.
---
Well, you're gonna have to stare at your room an awful lot, so...
---
Actually on Bigglesworth the AH is plentiful. Tons of epics, rares, and uncommons. There are Devilsaur sets, Staff of Jordan, crafting reagents... you name it.
---
Only thing I haven't seen are MC BOEs. Which I am sure will come soon.
---
I for one have no desire to transfer to an empty server. My average wait time during peak is less than an hour. At night the server dies off, as everyone goes to bed. Which makes it a good time to quest. And during peak times, dungeon grinding.
---
In 3-5 months, the hype will start to wear off and servers will become empty. People will be crying for server merges, mark my words.
---
Been playing on private servers for years. It's amazing how fast a server can go from active to a ghost town.
---
I thought I was all about PVE and small servers. But Lighthope changed my mind, PVP and interaction with people all around the world truly make for a MMORPG. If otherwise, it's just an solo RPG.
---
Graymane wall around 20. No one really there and tons of mob groups. Saw a mage kill like 10 at a time over and over
---
Just use the retail version in the classic folder? Or is there a specific version to use with classic?
---
This was my first epic item in vanilla.
---
It dropped in ZF. 
---
The leader said everyone need, but I was a rogue and I genuinely needed it. I got mad in chat saying I was the only one who could use, and can't believe everyone hit need.
---
Luck was on my side though. I won the roll and it felt incredible. 
---
Incredible weapon. Treat it well.
---
The way you run up stairs makes me dissy. You can just hold the button instead of correcting at every turn. Then you will cut the corners closer as well
---
They need honor to motivate them.
---
&gt;they said

Yep
---
.... no.

You should save your rez to save a wipe. When I heal, if you die. Your walking.
---
Im not saying pseudorandomness is unexploitable. I'm saying that a bug or oversight of that magnitude in the loot code of the world's biggest MMO would have been caught.
---
Beta 3 baby
---
I tend to always level both, so far a have a 40 hunter on alliance and horde. I definitely prefer alliance even though I've been making horde back since late vanilla. The zones and cities just strike a more relaxed feel with me. 
---
Alliance players have tended to be more helpful, obviously that can be misinterpreted but that's my experience so far.
---
&gt; How do you see them through combat log man. 
---
You read it…?
---
The combat log shows everything within a certain distance, whether you can see it visually or not.
---
He went to 2015. I thought the Almanac was printed in 2000, he bought it at an antique shop....
---
Most of the level 60 quests are involved with obtaining pre-raid bis and other useful items for one class or another. Chances are you'll have to do a bit of it anyway.
---
Yeah , quickly
---
Spongebob meme
---
No.
---
You’re the guy three drinks deep at a gay bar wondering why everybody is so darn friendly.
---
I'm pretty sure what happened is he already has the horde toon. His friends (the ones that wanted to play horde) already stopped playing wow. Now he is alone in a faction he doesn't wanted to play in to begin with.
---
And the correct one.
---
I always had to run to a capital city to que up. Then go quest until it was ready
---
Yeah that's how I felt too. Yeah I know that was stupid of me, I was just very confused about his reaction
---
I don’t know if chat is layered (I suspect it is not) but unless you’re in the same zone, they wouldn’t see it.
---
The addon targets and alerts you to player presence whether the camera can see them or not. Call me whatever you want you're still a cheater who can't stomach the idea of someone getting the drop on you. Wuss.
---
Knowledge is power.
---
I told myself I was going to go to bed by midnight last night. Tried to do Wailing Caverns for the first time around 10, found a group after a while, got first boss down- healer left. Found a replacement, went back in- tank left followed by a DPS. Left the group and waited a bit and finally found another one. Now, I had no idea how long it would take. Figured it wouldn't be too long as RFC wasn't. Didn't get done until 1:45, we were in there for almost 2 hours. Was a blast though, got great gear and had a great group to run it with.
---
It was nerfed around 1.12 check wowhead comments
---
But to answer your question go with what race you like the most. I’ve always liked orcs, ever since I was a kid I thought they were cool. If you feel that way about dwarves, or gnomes than do it. Go with the race you like first. Everything else second. 
---
The alliance sucks btw
---
I would wisdom as it will benefit mp5.
---
Either works for you but wisdom is preferred as the mp5 helps in combat.
---
-cheers
---
Phase 3! Every level bracket, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39 etc queues together with the exception of 60 which is just 60.

Thank you for the very helpful information, it seems like I have changed the names of these channels and then left them

Someone's mad they didnt have enough gold at 40 for their mount

Depending on the realm she could probably make some bank
---
This is a trend in Classic.  You will have access to a lot of great 1h weapons, but seldom a great 2h.  If you happen to have a great 1h weapon and want to sword and board, prioritize Str and Agi to maximize your dmg, dodge, and armor.
---
I know, I was talking about the feeling and not the actual randomness. 
---
This specific example could be a bug, especially considering they had to teach the new systems to read the old data.
---
You had me at ruining the experience for other people — I don't want this to happen. Thanks for pointing it out. I forgot that raids can be stressful if you're doing it wrong or if the team composition is messed up.
---
I would probably still consider getting a power leveling offer, but at the very least I won't rush the game and spend time practicing the raids with anyone tolerant enough to include me. Originally, I wanted to have a high leveled toon and just get to the raid part, but now I know I REALLY need to learn the ropes first.
---
Thanks.
---
Find the fight club warrior discord. Its for classic warriors. It has all that stuff. But the gist of it is sunder armor is best until a certain % enemy health(also depends on your level/ability rank) then its better to pool rafe for next fight. Only heroic strike if you will rage cap.
---
I think if they did a new timeline after classic it should go straight to Northrend and skip Outland for a much further expansion, and in Northrend, no flying, I’m a big believer that flying ruined a lot of the exploration and world aspect of the game once you could just go over and avoid everything. As much as I love flying I think it led down a bad path. Also Arthas was a bigger deal in w3 and really effected the world of Azeroth in a big way, illidan fought him but it ended with him retreating to Outland after his defeat but everyone knew the Koch king was a threat waiting for everyone above the world.
---
Got u I’m in queue. We just got to Ogrimmar probably gonna quest in the badlands
---
&gt;you can have multiple bars change
---
That sounds useful, could you give the name of the add on?
---
Ss ww is better
---
there is special version, currently part/raid frames doesn't work tough, so you will have to use shadowed unit frames or simmilar addon and disable everythign besides raid/party frames to go around issue
---
I never really liked horse models either, when I started WoW I made night elves, I always like elves and stuff, even more so after the whole Lord of the Rings movie trilogy.
---
And I just like the models.
---
The only model I liked on horde was blood elves, which came out for TBC. Later on I started to like undead a bit more also but still preferred alliance models.
---
Draenei are cool, worgen too.  Never made dwarves or gnomes, can’t stand those models either.
---
fuck hunters
---
True. That's what I fear, too, unless that person would be someone I know. Thanks for the wake up call.
---
If you have all your cooldowns arranged like that I just assume you click everything. Otherwise you wouldn't need such an obnoxious grid of buttons on your face.
---
I don't have turn keys bound unless I reach across the keyboard for the arrow keys, this is a combination of strafe and mouse turning.

---
I'm tanking lvl 58 now and I totally understand you. But after some times , I figured out what needs to be done.  
---
You need to force yourself as the leader of the party. Make them understand that YOU are the tank , YOU pull , YOU decide. and if they keep aggroing like retards or even pulling , let them die. They will verry rarely kick you. They want to go fast but they will never have the balls to play tank. You are the boss man , they are worms.   
---
Also , just spam demoralizing shouts when 4+ mobs , everything that go away , you cant do shit about it , they have to kite it.   
---
Anyway at this point , your main role is to tank the bosses and pack mobs before the aoe fiesta.   
---
Ah , and also it get a little bit better at 50+
---
At the end of the post he said he realized he had Party Invites disabled.
---
What about blood from your enemies?
---
Did you read the post? They're not talking about adding actual heirlooms ffs.
---
Fish the bay of storms.
---
I switched to Alli. Looove it. Great to get the other side after playing horde through cata.
---
Except don't be a gnome. Night elf female BiS.
---
I'd suggest DPS get a feel for the tank.  It never hurts to wait those 2-3 seconds at first just to gauge the tank's ability to hold aggro.
---
"Oh you almost had it, you gotta be quicker than that!"
---
I'll let you know when I get around to it. I haven't fully planned to move to the game, I'm still playing a bunch of console games but I'll keep this in mind.
---
yo, been playing role my whole life but never played classic till now, my advice is stick with the two swords or sword main hand and fast offhand with sword build for leveling
---
It won't be dead if you come, and it won't be dead for long regardless! Pop has already Blown up since Monday when there were STILL queues on Stalagg/Faerlina.

Sorry to sidestep the meme, but as a lvl 35 alliance....what the heck why are there so many effing horde everywhere
---
The secret trick is teamviewer app

Resisted both my Frost Nova and cone of cold after that I melted to overpower. Was a shame.

i tanked herod at 32 lastnight, most fun iv had so far.

East of Splintertree post there is a whole bunch of Demons around. IIRC there is a little gravestone of sorts on a hill deep in that area.

Windseeker - Alliance

Holy priest looking for a guild so I can reliably find a tank for dungeon runs and gradually work up to raiding. Currently level 29. Eager to experience all of the content classic has to offer.

So I went to wowhead.com and filtered quests by 60, you can adjust as needed and see what's all available.

LPT instead of wanding use Mind Blast. Its fast cast time almost always nabs me the delicious tap.
---
I think we're closing in on 6k characters over level 5, majority sitting Alliance for now but not by much.
---
what about equip dagger first, ambush, then equip sword?
---
what i can think of is put at the beginning of the macro
---
/equipslot 16 main hand dagger
---
/equipslot 17 whatever offhand you use
---
/cast ambush (same macro u had)
---
I'm not sure you can actually do this, but try it out.
---
The CelebriD&amp;D with Terry Crews just made me think they should crossover the two more often. It was a ton of fun.

Lol no, I was late to wow and I definitely remember it.
---
You’re getting good enough airport WiFi to play WoW? I always get shit WiFi!

Thanks for circling it
---
Raid guilds are actively looking for warlocks rn. There aren't many.
---
You know what, you're right. I was feeling the pressure and being left out. I dunno why I had this urge to rush the content. I've heard so many good things about Classic and because I never really played WoW, I thought I'd make a beeline to the endgame but yeah, everything in good time I guess.
---
Might I suggest this to save a precious bar slot? Though, tbh, I'm not sure modifiers work with a console command.

Did senpai not notice you on his own sub or Twitch that?

I use a naga, when its layed out like that its easier read what to press on the mouse
---
There are no rules to PvP. For example, I helped kill cyclonian for some level 31 warrior the other day and shortly after I got an invite to a brd group. They had a lock so instead of running it I just went around dotting up the level 20-30 horde out there questing. Got a good 75-100 kills while waiting. It was a blast.
---
I’m at the crossroads

I had a similar interaction on Rattlegore. I was lvl 36.  I showed up and was waiting for guildies to show up and help. A group of 5 Alliance level 38-40 showed up and they all saluted me and went to the gong and started jumping signaling me to summon. I summoned and tagged him then they all killed him. I turned in the quest and got my axe. I saluted them and went on my way.
---
Don't need to down rank, put renews on the party and focus on keeping tank alive.
---
Use bubbles on the dps with lesser heal, if the drop below 50, use lesser heal and greater heal on tank.
---
At lower levels you will have maybe 2 greater heals, so use one to keep tank around 50% (renew will help) and a bubble g.heal for when they drop to 20% / oh shit hp.
---
Use lesser heals to keep the group between 40 - 60% hp.
---
Also don't over look first aid as you can utilize it on tanks to help with mana juggling during wtf pulls.
---
Humans are tasty.

The ignroe list exists for a reason! bigots, edgelords, and idiots make it fill up pretty quickly

On my trial account I was laying down on the ramp to the blacksmith dude in storm wind when I got 1 shot by SOMETHING and was so confused. It wasn’t till much later till I realized this is what must have happened.
---
No... lots of people are playing wow.
---
Some real quality work.
---
You have a source on orcs being illiterate? I'm basically 100% sure this is not true considering the amount of books in thralls throne room/the cleft of shadow. I always assumed these signs were just stylized, and had words inscribed on the pointy bone bits.
---
No point in taming him til 60
---
Isn't that in desolace?
---
Scheisse!
---
I never said these were universal rules, I said these were my rules. I know there's no actual rules for PvP.
---
[deleted]
---
Yep, it's horrible.
---
Enhancement is like a warrior with 3/4 of his kit removed. You don't have movement, you barely have any lockdown/cc. You have barely any CC defense either. So you wait for an enemy to walk into you, let him have his way with you CC wise, and then pray you get a double windfury proc to instakill him for the short time after you have left alive. PvE damage wise it provides barely any damage above basic auto attacks due to the mana issues. The weapon buffs are only slightly better than what you can provide as AoE totems.
---
That said? 30/0/21 Ele/resto hybrid has plenty enough heals for PvE and is a great ranged nuke for PvP. Instant Lightning Bolt + Chain Lightning + earth shock is a disgusting burst of damage that lands in the span of half a second.
---
Sorry for the inconsistency, I just checked and Robe of Power is bind on pick up so only tailors who craft it can equip it. Anyway, the lock quest robe should be fine.
---
ezra is still alive in vanilla wow's timeframe
---
Could you correct me if this is inaccurate - we are all here to help the OP as best as we can
---
We aren’t really that deep into it yet.  I’d still say that this game is in its infancy for the player base experience in the game.  Will it reach full maturity or will it bust along the way and people go back to their Retail or other games?  Nobody knows.  Player predictions are always questionable

There is a turn in on the docks. For every 5 shellfish you get 55 silver.

I had a similar experience this past weekend. Amid all the DDOS fuckery, I finally got on to grind out some levels so I could hit new dungeons, but the entire zone of hillsbrad was overrun by pesky alli. I was on the beach doing a quest and didn't realize how close to South Shore I was. 
---
I see a horde warrior come streaking around the corner, very low on health. A half second later I see a frostbolt land on him, the finishing blow. 
---
A gnome mage, also very low on health appears. He got SWP and plague, but was able to frost nova me and run away. Dunno how he didn't die. 
---
Anyway a bit later he appears with like six buddies and they kill me several times, lots of spit macros and lol at me. All around good times. So i left my guy dead, and went to have dinner.
---
When I came back, I rezzed and stood on those hills that are technically 'in' southshore. I spent about 20 minutes killing AFK alli until someone figured it out. Then I spent about 20 more minutes corpse hopping back to tarren mill. 
---
Good times.
---
Oh nice I didn't hear about a layer cut.  Definitely feels more populated though.  I kinda enjoy it.
---
The bump on the "F" is one of the best hidden perks, no doubt.
---
What you can reach probably greatly depends on hand size though - I have no issue with CTRL in the ESDF set-up, but my wife can't use shift hardly at all.
---
How about we submit a ticket and see how Blizzard responses to this, instead of always  jumping on their back attacking them lol.
---
some people went hard, me included
---
Yup, I recall testing this extensively in vanilla because I always tried to kick last second.  
---
There is always a slight delay after using an ability and the casting bar either starts too late or ends too early, you can't trust it.
---
Kick at 50% just to be safe nowadays (unless im about to die and need to squeeze out every second, I hate spellcaster mobs)
---
Yes let's collect some moodium leather
---
I disagree. Downrank and top people off if there is no one else to heal. A downranked spell is drastically less mana than your highest rank spell.
---
Heal the way you want, just keep the point of OP's message and don't be stupid.
---
Assuming he meant end game raiding
---
nice, im planning on going sub when i reach 60
---
Ahh well they need to fix it, just makes me not want to play. I don't have much time as is but only being able to do 2-3 quests a night with how impossible it is to get mob drops is horrible.
---
End game pve will be meh at best, but for lvling and pvp, its solid
---
P
---
Ass?
---
There is a pserver with WSG bracket 1-10 enabled
---
a used 2013 MacBook is cheaper? w h a t
---
When you nut and she still suckin
---
It's not your area and the druid was right.
---
Either invite and group up if you're both doing a quest there for the mob(s) or don't and live with it.
---
"My area". 
---
Lol
---
This was my favorite part about the Legion profession quest chains. So much sass.
---
It's far less mana efficient than a lower rank heal is all, I don't see why you'd need to top off someone by exactly 150, that's a few seconds of passive hp regen at our level.
---
My favorite is the DR on Scatter shot also affecting Freezing trap, even if you manage to get the combo. 
---
Because this was a bug introduced in 1.12. It wasn't in 1.1-1.11 and wasn't in 2.0. But I guess Galaxy Brain nochangers won.
---
So what I do is I have a macro to weapon swap straight up, and I hit it when I go into Stealth to equip Dagger in my Main Hand.
---
I'm trying to get a Macro that will Ambush and weapon swap my Dagger to my Off Hand and my Sword to my Main Hand in one button press.
---
Yeah there’s no way a few million are playing Classic.
---
I've been meaning to post my quiver-weapon screenshots lol
---
When it's about questing, I always take quests that are the same lvl than me or up to 3lvls lower than me. I always navigate 2 or 3zones at the same time between the same zone lvl range (ie: 3zones between lvl20 to lvl30 are Redridge Mountains, Duskwood and Wetlands). On a PvP server, that could give an edge to avoid being ganked.
---
Yeah it's what makes juking so strong. For 1.5 sec casts you pretty much need to hit interrupt as soon as you see it, so it's very easy to cancel cast and bait the interrupt.
---
I play on mograine and have done a mix of AoE grinding and dungeon AoE to get to 53 so far. 
---
You get crashed a few times a night, and if your mobs are used in quests you're constantly dealing with people coming and tagging mobs you round up but it's still better than questing and hitting roadblocks due to PvP / overpopulation. 
---
You can AoE grind any melee mobs that spawn in tight packs, if you Google your locations odds are they're camped but theres hundreds of spots people skip because they don't make as much gold.
---
Following
---
Ui sauce?
---
Dude
---
Quick question do you only get to pick one tech tree? I thought in classic you could use whatever.  Is missing a few points that critical.
---
I’m fairly certain there is a setting in combat text that allows you to show healing on your target as a scrolling number. Check under the text tab near your chat bar or possibly under settings or interface. I know that’s not too specific but I’m not near my computer right now, hope that helps some :)
---
My warrior is is male worgen named Furyan
---
Fury(fits with the warrior spec) + Furian(Riddick reference)
---
Is this an epic?
---
Looks like the RP brigade came in and downvoted everyone that dared talk back against them.
---
Ok cool thats what im gathering from fury in general. That its better late game.
---
Enjoy your toon. You can trust me on that
---
Yesterday I went to SW keep to deliver The Perenolde Tiara quest.
---
Just as I entered the room, a gnome warlock was doing the quest where you give poison to a noble, so when the dude dies I started calling the gnome a murderer and he goes "Oh shit, now YOU also have to die" so he tried to attack me but his voidwalker "refused" to attack me cause it knew I was too strong so he just had to give up and run away
---
Yeah... the necronomicon. Now I’m not letting some trumped up jazz-monkey like you read from it and make another huge mess for me to clean up.
---
I would wait till blizzard rank 2 and cone of cold first which I think is like  late 20s early 30s. Then you’re able to farm a bit better and survive a lot more.
---
Which is all kinds of wrong.
---
I transferred from Herod to evergrowing Earthfurry and cant complain. Love it here
---
From what I've read the only job an Enhancement Shaman has is Totem Twisting; rotating between air totems to keep 2 buffs up. Drop WF Totem, and then I think the Agility air totem, then when WF wears off (10s) drop WF again, then Agility one.
---
That sounds awful tbh, since it will cost all your mana to constantly be refreshing totems. I can't fathom that the DPS of Enhancement is as bad as people say, but I guess it must be true.  Probably have a hard time being brought on raids by guild or pugs as a DPS in that spec, so its totem twisting or bust for the spec.
---
# would of

If it's a skull I run, unless they are attacking someone else. If it's red, I think about it and occasionally attack. If it's yellow, it's a fight. If it's green, it's a fight. If it's grey I let them run away.
---
Unless they are a gnome.
---
You’re playing TBC and Wrath is about to come out.
---
&gt;but if a fight DOES break out, it usually involves like 10 people in short order, someone wins, and everyone goes back to questing.
---
I fucking love this. Had this on Herod the other night in Tanaris where the pirates are. Felt like a mini pirate-themed BG going on, haha. It was amazing, had to have been 30 people involved from start to finish.
---
[most likely not a coincidence, this happened to me yesterday, more or less same spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6rlf1rH3B4&amp;feature=youtu.be)

1-12 Keypad on the mouse ftw!
---
The free character migration for full realms with queues, does this include a faction change as well? Does faction change even exist in classic?
---
Out of curiosity, is that in reference to the Thousand Foot Krutch song?
---
I'm level 27 and havent had a lot of issues leveling in protection. It is slow, but I just use demoralizing shout, sunder armor and heroic strike.

ALLIANCE CITIES GRIPPED BY HOMELESS EPIDEMIC
---
This is in shadowprey village btw.
---
What is that addon on the right? I need to know! :O
---
Can I have a link to the video? I am trying to find something relevant but I don't really know what I'm looking for. A lot of stuff I'm finding is for retail.
---
So what happens **when** you do this and hear sounds? Finish your title.
---
Yes, it did. I liked rotations in Wrath better than I liked them in Cata. At the start, yeah. People doing Stratholme and UBRS and stuff like that are using CC right now. And it was a nail in the coffin on an already bad expansion.
---
I quit playing in Cata and haven't played since for more than a month. You're not going to sell me on it.
---
lol
---
that's not what Shodan said when I running through her corridors
---
You can open these from junk boxes you find pick pocketing.
---
In Savannah!
---
Why would you need to strafe when riding to places? Just turning should be enough?
---
F
---
If you could dm me an ally guide that’d be dope.
---
Dude what?  I stopped playing WoW regularly years ago, but Ive never trashed it.  And I had no plans on playing Classic, but my friend bought me a sub, so I'm playing, and surprised I like it.
---
I just thought it was ridiculous that blizzard said "you don't want that" or whatever, when clearly a lot of old fans did. That's who I was telling to eat a brick.  Enjoy retail all you want man, I hope it lasts another 20 years.  But it's too "arcade-like" for me nowadays.
---
And I don't watch streams, I just like the slow place and immersion of classic.  Why do you care if people play classic?
---
No changes
---
I get paid subpar, so I'm just evening up the scales.
---
Just got mine today woot
---
You always need on high price boe
---
???
---
The post is asking about good items that will make a character stronger than average.  They'll still be doing the grind either way, it just might be 1/2/3% faster with some BiS leveling items lmao.  What's wrong with you?
---
He turned it down
---
I used to have a skinning knife with +30 spell power. I used it for my alt, then it went around the guild a bunch of times until I forgot who had it. Was definitely worth it though.
---
Why do you keep going on about eyesight? You have some special infra vision for WoW herbs? Yes you are a douche for blatant sarcasm on a joke post that you've escalated into insults. This clearly is never going to be a productive conversation so I'm done.
---
I'm beyond hyped now. That means that Phase 2 could be in like two to three months?
---
Looks like devs made a big effort to remove grief tools. Other ways to troll your own faction are also removed
---
If you're feeling evil you can throw a high rank of fort on someone just before they jump off a zeppelin, which you normally survive but seeing as fort makes your health drop to 60% they'll splat on the floor
---
SAME. I grew up moving with WASDQE because I was like 10 when I started, I eventually stopped using A and D. But couldn’t resist strafing on Q and W. So I just rebound A AND D
---
ok, keep us updated, as if it matters
---
GottaGoFast!
---
I tried to find one there. If anyone finds an in game setting keep me posted.
---
It's still gonna be a grind. It's simply a way to make it easier to level. I don't see what that has to do with it being classic or not.
---
Thanks for the reply man! I appreciate it a lot
---
In a perfect world, yes! However blizzard hasn’t officially stated when or how long each phase will be/end.
---
...hes not high enough level to farm literally ANY of the mats for either of his profs, meaning he was buying greens, cloth, mats etc the whole time. I HIGHLY doubt by the time one of his items sold it made up enough of that gold to afford a mount. It is literally simple math, lol.
---
Not just this, but they changed the mechanics at one point so that the infernal would come down hostile with the AOE damage originating from the infernal itself before becoming enslaved to the warlock.
---
This distinction is important because it meant that a warlock could hit anyone, including friendlies, with a small aoe... you could use it to kill people after they lost a duel and were at 1 health or low levels if you were feeling particularly evil... I.E: you could nuke the bank alts at the enemy city who wouldn't be pvp flagged.
---
So I've heard. Ain't nobody want that shit.
---
At first I thought this wouldn't work at all, but after thinking about it for a bit it actually could.  I don't there is a GCD for switching weapons when out of combat and if you're in Stealth you are almost out of combat by default...
---
I've got 5 mins left in the queue I'll be back to let you know if this works.
---
Some people are not poor.
---
As long as your enemies aren't demons...
---
that's only if you've recently trained the highest rank. As you level up you make more per cast.
---
Giving your healer a stack of 20 is the absolute bare minimum. If you intend to do more than 1 run they're just going to be asking for more water again. and again. and again.
---
Np GL. I did this to kill time in between grind sessions on all the beasts near the mountain beside shadowprey. I hit 280 skinning and had about 130g when I dinged 40 as a priest.
---
Nah that's not funny to me at all. And doesn't fix the underlying problem.
---
No need for that language champ
---
Yeah they did. I remember someone trying to do it post AQ release and he despawned mid kite.
---
Yup
---
I kill all the Ally I can no matter what so lol
---
I have played a significant amount of both factions on Vanilla. I do not think there is a wrong choice. I think people benefit from playing both because they are actually 100% different cultures and experiences and that is something I think oof blizzard nailed. I think they are both extraordinary experiences and you should play alliance until you want to play the horde culture again.
---
Yah I'm so happy with it. Perfect desk art.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/humanoid-npcs?filter=10;1;0
---
Still waiting for a source on this "they intentionally made him unkillable" statement
---
also a source for that even more ridiculous "they despawned KT" allegation. Why the hell would they despawn a boss on a first night of attempts after it took literally 2+ months just to get to the boss? You're not even being consistent anymore.
---

Nobody said they were illiterate

Orcs in vanilla cannot speak the common language.

If it was your first, then i'd def cut ya some slack but hot damn it was very very annoying after being in there for 1 and a half hours already.
---
No, because I don’t need herbs / ore for my professions.
---
Healer here. Dps rushing instances suck. I recently had a Rogue in ZF who refused to slow down and never attacked the same target as the tank. Every fight took about twice the mana it should have and I had to sit down and drink more, so its not like we were really going any faster.
---
At the end, I asked him if he came here from Retail, and he said he started in WoD. That explained things.

Haha this is my favorite thing to do as an undead. For the Horde

Yes I have this issue too

This is why I corpseran to every fp in the game at level 30 whole waiting for my friends to get online

Wand and shoulders for clothy quest chain in wetlands.

Is this shit true? I thought they made it so they link together in the best way (AS LONG as you have the interconnecting points, unlike OP.)
---
You can just walk down from Hillsbrad and not have to travel through a level 50-60 zone and a 45-55 zone.
---
Well thank you. That's a lot better than my previous option. Now all I have to do is select the enchant, mouse click the enchant button, then press macro button, click enchant, macro, enchant, macro, etc. Thanks!
---
Warden.  You will 100% get banned.
---
I personally just leave people alone unless I see them attacking but nothing is better than a good old world PvP battle
---
The wrath one where they actually paid the proper Arthas voice actor to do the trailer gave me chills.
---
Wrath would of been so much better with the proper voice actor instead of mister gravel voice generic bad guy.
---
These would be more convincing if you took a picture of them in the loot window.

How much did you sell it for? I paid for 2 stacks 40s yesterday to catch my alch up to my herb
---
I always feel the same unless I'm actively on a vacation somewhere that's not my home. Like if I'm just taking time off to not be at work and have a stay-cation? I'm over it by day 4/5.
---
I can't do much to help warriors as a hunter but I always fire off a couple of shots and serpent sting any mobs they're fighting when I'm running past. Not sure if it helps but I feel better doing it.
---
In that case isn't the Lash better? Because it does equal the amount of the damage per hit to Omen and it's faster and it can proc the shadow bolt on it. Or you think the stats Omen gives is just better? I was tied up between the daggers proc and speed vs the swords stats and 5/5 sword spec that I'm using.
---
Uh oh he's pulling out the blocks, watch out ya'll
---
As someone that played from Vanilla to Cata, and intermittently after that, getting a BoE epic would still feel magical. Pretty sure I ever saw one drop, and I lost the roll

Same way you would get it at any other level I'd imagine

That conversion wasn't a thing til wrath I thought. During beta could have been a mechanic that they forgot to remove.

I actually forgot when you left deadmines you came out the other side. I like the running far more.

Ehhhh. Enhance sham with better version of WF totem makes a noticable difference. 30% damage difference.

Maybe off topic but I remember in classic if i jumped off the tram, it would dc me over and over and over. Tried multiple times and it always caused a loop of crashing until I could slowly run to the end and gtfo.
---
To bad he's not alive IRL
---
That was offered BY blizzard way back in the day wasnt it? Or am I miss remembering that.
---
I hope it is a big, bad as it sounds, it's one of the reasons I'm leveling my lock on the side. Gotta make your own fun :p
---
I know how the combat log works, that's why I was confused by what you were saying, and yes it works great.. But regardless of what that says even if someone is just riding their mount it will pop up on the window without performing any combat buff or debuff action.  That is what caught my attention about it.

For WC chest you have to full clear WC. Several times.

It was a combination of everything.  More levels, new zones not connected, layering, phasing, server merge, looking for group, flying, Stat squish, talent tree removal, skill reagent removal, quest item removal, key ring...
---
DnT got KT to 3% and he was despawned. Blizzard GMs and Devs were watching the fight, as they always do for progression content. 
---
Not sure which part of this is controversial?
---
I don't disagree with you that full servers suck in some ways, but I do see the same people I've done dungeons with through guilds and other groups I get invited to heal in. I think it really depends on how much you put yourself out there as well.
---
I'd like to add that if you pull 3 targets it makes sense to blow all your dps mana on one target because once it's dead you reduce the amount the healer needs to heal by 1/3. The only thing the healer can influence is waste as little mana as possible and regenerate as much as possible while keeping the group still alive.
---
I have a bank alt named Ricardo and I'm still trying to find a red bandana for him
---
Even us humans view the gnomes with disdain. Filthy, grubby hands and their sharp little teeth, gnawing on all my wooden furniture. Disgusting.
---
no addons like that in Classic
---
And don’t get me started on goblins(I think these are what happens when orcs and gnomes have relationships)
---
Honestly I only ever enjoyed playing horde when blood elves came out. I don’t like trolls, orcs or tauren models either.
---
So now all of my characters are human if possible in classic. It’s the only model I really like playing.
---
Wait does this work?
---
Yeah I don't use cheating add-ons, so no I'm not intimately familiar with how it works. I had the right idea though.
---
Me being a little wrong about how it works doesn't justify you using it, because it's cheating. So, just keep that in mind.
---
I commented on it because improving discourse is very important to society.
---
look at the ground right next to it, it's someone's pet on a flight path.
---
I took 4 months in vanilla to lvl my warlock to 60, I think you guys are just pushing too fast and getting burned out.
---
Or people have critiques / bugs with the game and want the devs to see? Reddit has shown time and time again to be the best place to voice opinions.
---
Also be careful of the /click part. It will click the first button an any pop up message that is up. So you may accept or do something you didn't intend if used at the wrong time. That's the only caveat.
---
I got 6600 xp from the very easy quest which is about 2x as much as I get from quests my level

I had a Twink in BC. NE warrior 49 bracket. I'd sit in shadowmeld in the flag room and charge anyone who came in and 3 shot them.
---
Mik's scrolling battle text
---
It is possible, though I can’t remember if vanilla had a patrolling guard that can see through stealth. There’s usually a 60 elite with detection but they’re easily avoidable (if I remember correctly).
---
In vanilla on my gnome rogue I used to sneak around horde towns and UC a lot.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.

---
Servers still shit for me (Faerlina), really feeling my money's worth from this sub....
---
Holy fuck, i used to have this as well 😂
---
You realize it's just a level grind right? Everyone's going through the same thing, we just don't have any help from our mains, or heirloom items to make it go faster.
---
I ran into this problem myself a few times, and really the solution is right in front of you. Just be a tiny bit social and group together with other players. I spent a couple hours last night partied up with another warrior in strangle thorn vale, and between the two of us we managed to shred through 5 or 6 orange quests. 
---
We both nearly died many many times, and we did die once or twice, but we were usually able to taunt, fear, bandage our way out of tough situations with a tiny sliver of health. It was a lot of fun, and creates these little memories that you will remember years from now.
---
Pathetic alliance. So soft.
---
I used to do sneak in to faction cities all the time as a rogue. As long as you are high enough level, and avoid the few guards with stealth detect, it’s easy.  I had a lot of fun doing it.
---
Also, if there tank is lower level than the mobs then they need even more time to build threat. 2 levels lower is enough to push the miss/Dodge/Parry percent up. Until we are max level and getting hit gear we have issues building threat.
---
When the warlock is happily lifetapping away at his health after I healed him, I won't heal him again. Mana is more important on the healer than on a warlock.
---
There's a risk with chokepoints and most large towns have a special elite guard that has extremely high stealth detection patrolling near the middle. That's about it. You can definitely sneak around and do what you want at high levels.
---
It’s acceptable to charge for a lockbox opening as it’s a skill that takes time investment to level and lots of rogues don’t bother. 
---
It’s more akin to skinning then mage water. 
---

I've died enough inside for the both of us. Took about 8-9 months to get to 60 while constantly changing my UI...😳☠
---
Instead of doing a whole managed account system have you considered just putting the macro code on GitHub and then allowing others to share add-ons via pull requests? Would simplify alot and also allow for peer review of macros before merging then in.
---
Pretty much my story as well. Was around 3-400g at 60. The only thing I remember before logging off yesterday was buying two blue items off AH. Boots and a chest. Paid something like 100g for those. That's the only major transaction that has happened on my account. Other than that I've just been questing and running dungeons. Everything I've looted and didn't need on my main, I've mailed to my level 1 bank character and auctioned off the excess cloth, etc. I have not a single clue as to what got me banned. All I can do now is wait for the appeal to get reviewed again and hope they see nothing out of the ordinary has happened. I'm super anxious about getting an email saying "yeah, no". What the fuck do I do then. 15 years of WoW wasted. I don't really care about retail anymore, but holy shit I've collected so much shit, stuff that's no longer obtainable, etc. All lost to a ban you have no idea why happened. Fingers crossed. For both of us.
---
People in Vanilla used to try justify going 51pts in a spec to "truly take on that role."

Downranking heals wasn't common. 
---
Most hybrids didn't want to heal, so healers were rare and had no incentive to actually get good. 
---
Keyboard turning and clicking was seen as acceptable. 
---
A lot of kids on potatoes running at 15 FPS.
---
What’s that /played at doe
---
Have to make a guild called &lt;we met on Grindr&gt; now
---
data is incomplete. Need more people to get addon and upload data
---
Aaand suddenly I wish I could edit titles :D
---
Would have*. Come on now, son.
---
Arms is 100% perfectly fine for tanking every single 5man dungeon even at level 60. If anything it's a bit tougher to tank 5mans as prot because you deal and take less damage, making you generate less rage, making it more difficult to keep aggro.
---
I like the irony of your name with what you play.
---
In feralas, i couldnt see a single player. It was like playing on an empty realm. So idk what youre talking about.
---
that Giants zone with the boring daily quests was also great for flying
---
i can admit it did do it well, but afterward the rest of the game just is fly here, fly there. but man how much more treacherous was everything when we had to scale a mountain vs just flying to ICC.
---
I would say yes because the extra attack. The difference is minimal at best. If you have a sword at 1.9 or lower your good for your offhand.
---
Easy. Sleep at 2 am. Wake up at 7 30.
---
Add a post-cata quest to Classic? Yeah, that'll go well.

\-Hand me that rag that's soaked with the funky smelling liquid...
---
Shhhhhhh quiet now little human. It'll all be over soon...
---
Lol someone can't read, it's clearly a finished sentence.
---
Ok, but did you sew the shoulders onto the dress or just super glue them there?
---
Then you lose access to friends. I mean it is worth the wait if you have a day off but man does it suck when you have work.
---
The mafia means a group effort to control the farming of the resource, not necessarily the sale of it. Horde get X amount of kills and Alliance get Y amount.
---
Not when it comes to PvP servers.
---
That's why I let him get ganked with healing. Respect others it goes a long way.
---
Been watching this debate rage on the Blizz forums across 4-5 different threads today, glad to see it make its way to Reddit. 
---
The right way for rogues to handle this is staying in character. Pretend you never leveled lockpicking, then sneak back after the run and loot. Immersion baby.
---
I wish I could go back and see the 2005ish wow site again.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2in6l/seems_like_faerlina_is_down/). 
---
He had to charge up off that hill so he could zoom in super fast.
---
Shit must not have been me then, I feel like the run I'm thinking about was not that long. And the guy that had to leave and come back needed repairs, not ammo. I think I was mistaken, but I am a rogue and definitely had to have someone walk me back to the right place after falling.

---
Yes, the global cooldown is 1.5 seconds, but seeing a mage not realize that he's blizzarding in the middle of a pack of mobs and die is still not reacting fast enough.
---
Just because I can't request a statistic doesn't mean I have no argument. Can you show me a statistic for "proper decisions given the circumstances in a dungeon environment?" How about a statistic for "thought process when the dungeon begins to wipe?"
---
Do you even statistics for the average player? What level is the average player? How much time are people taking per level nowadays versus back in 2004? How many wipes occur in dungeons nowadays versus in 2004/2005? How many people miss the jump in WC nowadays versus in 2004/2005?
---
Same thing happened to me on Razorgore!   
---
Even down to the part where we slowly built up an everyone-vs-Cyclonian fight club, with Horde and Alliance taking turns.   
---
I just assumed I had good karma from STV (as an Ally warrior I sincerely believe that it's the highest virtue to help any Horde warrior doing warrior quests - cause baby we got it bad as it is), but I'm very very happy to hear that across multiple realms the Brotherhood of Warriors is a bond that transgresses faction affiliation.
---
Yeah for some reason mine is all jacked up. But then again I’m using “in home switching” instead of moonlight. When I try and launch moonlight on the switch it opens and immediately crashes. The only build I can find is listed as “unusable” so I guess that’s why lol
---
Are you able to press one of those buttons to resolve your issue?
---
That was the biggest load of horseshit I've read all day. Thank you.
---
Lose the community you’ve already invested 50 hours into being a part of. That’s the downside.
---
It's not Shroud's fault but the kids who have been "hitting" the server are doing it to prevent streamers (Soda, Asmon, Esfand, Shroud etc.) from raiding and have been doing it for 4 days now. I kinda feel like streamers need to take a little responsibility here and stop streaming raids. The servers are fine when the attackers aren't preventing them from doing something.
---
Not casting detect magic, fucking casual.
---
It's appreciated, on my ele shaman the first thing I do is track down a mage who'll sell me 5 stacks of water because vendor water is disgustingly expensive when you go through it that quickly.
---
Cool. I’m using Dominos myself and all seems good with sexy map at this point. The only thing I’ve found is  when I swap to a brand new Alt to setup, I can’t move my portraits even after unlocking them. The work around is turning off all addons and move the portraits a little. Then turn them back on and I can move the portraits around as much as I want.
---
I knew this was a thing in retail but I didn't know it's been a part of the game for so long
---
We have a guildie with megadoong, based on his favourite eve online ship fit the megathron class megadon
---
Someone is attacking Blizzard
---
I tried enslaving an infernal in Desolace and when i tried to set it loose in Ghost Walker Post it simply despawned immediately
---
&gt; Why do you think sunder is only effective on "mobs you shouldnt be grinding"? Thats very untrue.
---
because if they're living long enough for sunder stacking to make a noticable difference, you are grinding on something you shouldn't be. 
---
&gt; You have it backwards.
---
I promise I'm way more experienced with this than you are. 
---
&gt;There is full simulation showing this in the OP.
---
That doesn't begin to show what you think it does. 
---
&gt;Stop making up bull shit like " sunder only good on low levels".
---
LOL. Can you quote me saying that? That's the opposite of what I said. I think I see the problem here. Your reading comprehension.
---
I get that.  But when the server is being ddos'd and your being kicked into a 2 hour queue I think there's a point where you have to sort out some priorities.  Maybe coordinate with friends to do the migration idk.
---
Why is it just between the miners though? They wouldn’t have access to that node if the group hadn’t gotten them there. So everyone is entitled to the ore. 
---
/s, but that’s basically the argument being made for chests.
---
T1 hunter is my favorite hunter set.
---
I'm tired of the reddit "CITATION?" from some sweaty nerd who thinks he's right. Their terms of service in 2012 alone prove they collusion was against the rules and the WoW forums have universally agreed on it for years. Hell until like three years ago it was still bannable.
---
Solid sets, imo.
---
&gt; the initial day 
---
Shh, nobody tell him about the chronic turners.
---
Soooo why did the horde let the forsaken and Sylvannas stay in the horde (and become the fucking warchief!) after that? I skipped from the end of WotLK until the middle/end of MoP
---
Dominos works really well to show and customise all bars. I find it simpler ti use than bartender which seems overly complicated for what it is.
---
It's almost like I'm not talking out of my asshole like you are and test things and do what's faster!
---
You just made my week friend! I fucking love Peggie and I had no idea this existed!
---
EXACTLY! there is so much linen and wool, i grab it all
---
Just a heads up, was coming back to tell you that Blizzard responded to us and is actively investigating the issue.  I would expect the fix to come before long as it's relatively simple.
---
At the end of wrath is where the playerbase started to drop off... that would be as far as they would go.  One step further and talents go away and we might as well be on retail.  I would love a full wow2 to bring classic and retail together.  Take the best of both worlds.  Tbc and wrath would be sweet to play again, mostly tbc as wrath started to go down the wrong road.  If they did tbc after classic and then wow2 be my dream scenario to keep me around and not leave for a decade again.  Wow2 would have to be more like classic play wise though.  It would be a fresh game so the hard leveling would fit right in as everyone is doing it and hitting those dungeons.
---
Slightly underpopulated on Alliance in my experience.
---
No, they’re just doing their job. I don’t watch twitch really, but they’re just trying to make a living and there’s nothing wrong with that at all.
---

---
In case anybody needs a link
---
Well classic was going strong for 3 years at least, and given the amount of stuff you can do outside of just hit Max and raid, I think it will be alright.
---
i can send you one that i think looks good but honestly i did this on my own
---
Calicool.
---
Eh if a rogue wants dibs on all the locked chests in a dungeon maybe he should try to solo it.
---
I distinctly remember killing low level players in Goldshire with my infernal as a gnome warlock in Burning Crusade. I didn't play during Vanilla so it must have still been in the game.
---
you're a racist spazz bogle.
---
I just chose my character's hair color
---
Back in the day I always RP'd as an undead defias who is a liason to the horde.
---
Offhand only needs to be quick because it's there for poison proc. The damage really is secondary.
---
We all know WFs are EU lol
---
Unfortunately
---
We're looking into this! Thanks all for hanging in there, as updates become available I'll pop back into the thread.
---
Whenever I see videos with the UI that shows gold amount....I always zoom in to check the amount and also the persons level to compare how broke I am at my lvl lol. 
---
Anyone else?
---
Me too, tried to switch to a bear or turtle but no charge hurts me deep
---
While ignoring that vanilla has a quest chain about Chen Stormstout.
---
I’ve been dualboxing a warrior/Druid and it’s unreal.  
---
  
---
Pull 4-5 mobs my level without issue and have no downtime before the next pack.  Can highly recommend to anyone with more money than sense.
---
Neither can undead, tauren, or trolls. Your point?
---
If harming a random person's playtime is toxic, then anyone who has ever killed anyone is toxic. I just want to quest in STV and this random guy, same level as me, runs by and kills me while I'm fighting a mob, my time is now wasted and that guy is toxic? As annoying as it is, killing lowbies is still PvP, corpse camping is still PvP, large raids of the opposite faction killing everyone in their path is PvP. They have PvE servers for those that can't handle being on a PvP server so maybe you should reconsider.
---
I feel like my "opinion" on PvP things is anything player vs player.... it's literally in the name. If you have a different opinion on what PvP is, well maybe it's not PvP.
---
This guy AH's
---
Because people without BS don’t **need** ore, but chests contain items that could be useful to anyone.
---
It's not a post-Cata quest. It was added in 2007.
---
Yeah used to be able to buy a statue of your toon. Didn’t know they were 3D printed
---
We have a guy named GrindrHunter in our guild, asked him if he wanted to be my bf and he said yes. I'm so happy.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
I mean, I'd report you, yeah.
---
B... But all the knots are the same!
---
/ignore (rogues name)   
---
problem solved, get over that bridge of yours
---
How's resource farming?  That's the part I wanted to avoid was a legion of streamer followers trying to appease their twitch God by farming nodes non stop for them.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
All ur other names are fine why did u start this
---
 Use Battle Shout, Demo Shout splits threat.
---
Oprah refrence.  So glad there's an older group of people in this game.
---
Maybe, but it's easier to circle strafe with keys then it is mouse + keys
---
A+E circle right
---
Q+D circle left
---
I do agree we should have this quest in the game it seems strange to not have a memorial quest just because it wasn't around in Vanilla.
---
Just arrived here, not sure how I'm actually supposed to progress. Endlessly getting attacked eventually somebody by the name of Kron came and killed Hordes of horde.
---
I've never attacked a horde player before but this place has made me attack on sight because they'll kill me if I don't. I can't get anything done.
---
From any humanoid at high level?
---
Or....git gud
---
stupid names like that are boring and unfunny imo
---
right click their portrait and click inspect. or /inspect
---
Right click their portrait
---
Just open trade with every mage you see and say “water” until you get some
---
I had some quests to do both in the swamps and badlands, so I decided to travel from Grom'Gol and do it all at once instead of lot of flying here and there. And also visit both Karazhan and Black Mountain.
---
Honestly, if a chest is locked then I let the rogue have it. Either way, without the rogue you wouldn't have a chance at opening it so why try and roll? And he gave you an option to buy the service which is pretty fair given that decent loot can be inside.
---
Cake
---
Somebody needs to answer this!
---
/spit
---
So should I ask everyone to /roll for the soulstone or discharge every one of the group 10 silver each for wipe protection
---
target &gt; right click &gt; inspect
---
I joined in patch 1.10 and played a lock up until TBC. I specifically remember Infernals causing an AoE and attacking anything and everything around it when summoned. This was not changed in 1.12. In fact I dont even think it was changed until after TBC released.
---
Your graphics card cant handle the increase in demand
---
Yeah and after 4 quests in one zone move into the next because you're 7 levels above that one. You go through a long line of quests that gives you a blue item but LOL BOAs. Plus doing any professions is meh because what's the point by the time you get to Max the LFR gear is better than what you can make.
---
I'm broke too man :( going to have to grind some gold beyond 40 almost guaranteed
---
Had that happen to me, was super happy I didn’t miss it. Just after the loading screen however, I fell off and almost died of fatigue
---
You get 3
---
Not 100% sure, but I thought you needed to tame a pet with L2 screech to learn that rank.
---
do you use your left 3 fingers to move or do you give up your right strafe to crouch?
---
Oh man we had a pretty good fight in south shore too last night on kromcrush. I have been loving the organic world pvp
---
i hope someone enslaves you and calls you a "unit"
---
Dude, please never stop making these. You're the best thing on this subreddit right now.
---
I remember that from back in the day.  Didn't even think about it now though, gonna have to watch for stupid pathing.
---
1. Move to a poor country
---
2. Do paid surveys online
---
3. ???
---
4. Profit
---
Then you'll have to worry about having a *real* job ever again. :)
---
Hey my man I am on another server but i have characters on Thunderfury and I might move my Main over thre. Add me chiefbignutz#1152
---
Guys below can add me as well!
---
one of my absolute favorite Easter eggs. i used to go here often and slow walk starting at the bell and take in every second. it never got old.
---
im impressed. currently working on mine
---
Kinky
---
I would feel so dumb going all the way back where I started lol
---
Theramore... *chuckles in mana bomb"
---
Imagine thinking you're right when literally every discussion on this comes to the same conclusion OUTSIDE of private server fanatics. 
---
The WoW forums have discussed it since classic was revealed and universally agree that it was bannable.
---
Don't go chasing waterfalls
---
Yes, let the hatred flow through you.
---
We'll make you part of the Horde yet!
---
Pulling mobs from range, hamstringing in dense area, use of rage, being well supplied. I can't think of anything else.
---
Yea i thought the same thing and love seeing the chars, i played wow in 2004, then hearthstone, now back in classic and i love it. Nat pagle the fisherman lol.
---
You can! https://web.archive.org/web/20051001000000*/Worldofwarcarft.com
---
Only MC's I ever got as a Undead Rogue back in vanilla were those that would lead me to melt what was left of my half decomposed face into the bottomless pit of lava in blackrock mountain.
---
People just assume we are bad guys but I swear that Lobotomizer just stabbed itself on his party member's backs.
---
Because when people see someone with a buff they can give they usually won't try buffing them.
---
Upvote for the win!
---
Some people dont have phones
---
“Wanna see me run up that hill and back?... Wanna see me do it again?”
---
That’s step two after /kick (rogue’s name)
---
I will kill you if I see you #theHorde
---
Cool, that’s good to hear. Thanks
---
The free ones. The extra time spent sitting (when there is any) doesn't make up for having tons of consumables available.
---
Consumables basically don't sell until you hit endgame stuff when people are stocking for raids. The few that do are usually crafting ingredients.
---
You can! https://web.archive.org/web/20050701000000*/Worldofwarcraft.com
---
Do you get what I'm saying at least?  Retail is here to stay and that's good, but there apparently a lot of people who wanted, and are playing, vanilla, and it was stupid to pretend otherwise.
---
I didn't Down vote you dude lol, what did I say to offend you? Do you think classic is a bad thing? I don't get this thread haha.
---
For real, getting anywhere in ashenvale is just rediculous
---
Spell power &gt; MP5 &gt; Spirit
---
What's on their loot table that's so valuable, elemental earth?
---
Yep you may get a 5 day ban too
---
You seem to have forgotten the parties and misses in there. 
---
Attack mob miss and or parry 5 times in a row. Then slowly die because my only hope of escape is hamstring but I dont have enough rage to do it.
---
There’s your first problem, you rolled a soy guzzling faction
---
Sigmar is a terrible name, I don't see how you even thought there was a change you could get away with it. It's baffling. Seeing that you had to use an apostrophe only shows the world has more like-minded wretches.
---
Bwahaha
---
Add Ragnaer as well, this dwarf warrior would be proud fighting the horde with you!
---
I see where you're coming from but I completely disagree. If I see a DPS at 50% hp I'm not wasting mana topping them with a max rank heal. I'll throw a lower rank to get them back up to 75% or else I'm just wasting mana.
---
My highest rank heal heals clothies for about half hp, maybe a bit more. If it's a messy pull and a few people are low and taking damage I'm not waiting until they get below half hp to heal them.
---
Haha is horde the more popular faction?
---
Don’t waste your money buying consumables on your first broke ass character. Level fishing and cooking along the way and you’ll have free food buffs for yourself and to sell. I caught a shit load of sage fish in hillsbrad because I’d just fish for a bit when the gank squads were out in force.
---
Have you done armoursmithing or weaponsmithing yet? I am at 277 BS after hitting 60 a couple nights ago. Despite going HARD in the first week and then taking some time from 45-60, I've had to buy most of my mithril to do the quest (34 away from armoursmithing completion).
---
I figure there are definitely people max'd out 300 BS with weapon or armour, but I have yet to see anyone offering services on Skeram.
---
how did you get to the enchanting trainer in ULD tho? had a friend(s) run you to her?
---
No shame man. Just do what you want, it doesn't really matter in the end.
---
PS - Allies are almost always underdogs on every server, if that helps.
---
It's been 2 weeks basically.  Slow the concern.  Many people going to take months to 60.  You'll be with the masses.  It's all good.
---
r/HydroHomies
---
Advertise slow group or quest run
---
That's so awesome. We're on Kirtonos. Cross-realm Warrior Coalition!
---
So you’re saying undead is way better
---
Good to hear, the response I got from my support ticket was 2 sentences basically saying we know and then was marked as answered.  There was no way for me to follow up describing we figured out the problem being PDAnet.
---
I was there fighting in hillsbrad about that time
---
People get desperate for a healer lol. Did a full run twice
---
Thanks!
---
No you won't. At worst they'd make you change the name so just go with it. My name is offensive to some people in a context and has been reported several times and nothing has happened.
---
Im not saying don't roll on them or that he gets your box you won. i'm saying he doesn't have to open them for free since its a skill he spent time on.
---
Do i have to let you roll on the herbs you can't pick?
---
A 100gbps carrier circuit into a data center isnt that expensive? uhh
---
Without the group the rogue doesn’t get the chance to roll on it either so seems fair to me.
---
Thankfully I didn't get fatigue but I did fall off.
---
And walk all that way? Hell naw
---
*PSA to everyone but healers because they don't understand this concept
---
Jim, bears can climb faster than they can run! Jim!
---
I’m loving that everyone feels the same about this topic as me! Everyone is so deeply on one side or other
---
Anduin Lothar was my favorite character and I liked the Alliance a lot when I was younger and first started playing WoW. My first character was even a Human Warrior. I've since been a Horde player for a long while now though.
---
The former not the latter.
---
I travelled all the way to the western plaguelands this morning with more than a few deaths to complete the harvest quest only to find I’d left the offering in the bank.
---
I was with a group of, shall I say, unique individuals - who spur the moment prompted me to make a character with this name. Rolled the stupidest looking gnome I could make and hit create.
---
That's only 5.5 hours of sleep.
---
Rip
---
s-shtohp makin foon of meh....-eats begger-
---
Outside of the digsite in Loch Modan for [Gathering Idols](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=297/gathering-idols). Nearly impossible to complete without a group as the quest is given to you 4-6 levels below the mob levels - not to mention the seemingly awful drop rate. I thanked him and he invited me to his guild.
---
There's nothing wrong with wanting to stream or doing it for a living, I never said that, but look at what him wanting to stream a raid is costing *everyone* on the server. How do you defend someone that would rather perpetuate the attack? He knows he's being targeted, he's okay letting tens of thousands of players not experience the game because he wants to stream a 15-year-old dungeon?
---
Should we tell him guys?
---
Ele earth, deeprock salt, heavy Stone and tons of vendor trash.
---
I don't know how much you g/hour you can expect but for the 20g op comment needs I can't imagine it would take more than 3-4 hours, maybe less? Hopefully someone else can chime in with a better idea. 
---
I haven't started playing yet but this is my go to area for 39 - Low 40 solo farming.
---
So the lvl 60 guards will always see you if you are in their radius?
---
Nope
---
I think you took the light hearted joke a little too seriously there bud
---
You had to back up to get a downhill running start.
---
had to get that extra momentum
---
Not really, she only teaches enchants up to 250, everything beyond that is learned by recipe, so I learned 225-300, level up to 250 and went back one last time to learn everything.
---
Yes, I felt a real sense of pride and accomplishment running all over Azeroth to get my water totem.
---
For real though, the adventure and lore aspect of getting them really is amazing the first time around. It sucks that so many people are too busy looking at the finish line to enjoy the journey again.
---
This is my first time playing so I’m sure it’s bad on both sides. I posted after dying  to the same guy, at the same spot.  He has been there for hours destroying people
---
If I had a cult of druids who turned into snakes, we'd be in a cave too.
---
Is the cat stealth easier to detect (vs the rogue stealth)?
---
Donno about that but its definitely the superior one.
---
Lok Tar Ogar! For the Horde!
---
There was [a survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTfTNjcThmoe_47K8mbf8IffpfK0XrBCFWE4X5X97wY/edit#gid=1614806738) thrown out, but no, there's nothing official like Retail has.
---
A chest and a dungeon are not really on the same scale, to be honest. You don't do a dungeon for the chest, they're just a chance at better loot. It's totally the rogues choice to share or be greedy. Nothing wrong with it.
---
That sounds like exactly what i was hoping for thanks :)
---
To each their own but I just check out the buildings and look around. I think the people whining about not finding quests just don't want to look and act as if playing the game itself is a drag cause oh man I have to look around a town? Shit dude I ran through the few basements of stormwinds cathedral just to see whats down there and maybe a quest would be there. There was not, but I did find it interesting the first floor is all "light be with you" and as you went deeper underneath it, you found torture devices and some spooky stuff. Paying attention to the surroundings is part of the experience it's just another case of people wanting to be told which direction to go. 
---
If people wanna use questie at least admit you don't like having to slow down and take the world in
---
Just ask "Can I need on this one?" and maybe give a reason.
---
For the most part people will say sure, otherwise always greed. People will assume you're just doing it for the silver.
---
Very similar story for me.
---
Tauren Warrior, dual-wielded from lvl 1 to 47 (highest lvl I got before TBC hit), never heard of WW Axe or the Brutal Armor Warrior gear, had no friends to party with until lvl 20+, even then only one so couldn't run dungeons, etc.
---
Hit my STRIDE in Cataclysm with a Warrior, got pretty high PvP ranked doing 2v2 arenas with my wife (who I met online during the end months of WotLK, met, married, been with and played WoW with ever since, etc)
---
Been loving the '2nd chance' at Vanilla in the form of Classic; realizing more and more each day, each re-discovery, just how much I loved and missed Vanilla.
---
I'm sad that they patched wallwalking :(
---
That is what I hope to do, thank you for the info :)
---
LFG/LFR needs to go. Premade group finder is fine. Also need to up the difficulty leveling.
---
awesome thank you
---
They’ve streamlined it so much that if they tried to change it back there would be backlash about.
---
As much as people love the classic feel, there would be riots if they changed retail.
---
thank you ill try that!
---
Okay well then I guess I better start charging people for a summon to the dungeon because I paid for the summoning ritual spell, it was actually quite expensive.
---
This is my complaint too, the whole point of the previously mentioned s binding is to retain full movement
---
To be fair I always thought layering was a good idea if they balanced it properly.
---
Care to elaborate a bit more?
---
 I'll offer a counterpoint to the guy below and some small advice. 
---
Demoshout is good, but it's not amazing for threat, since it splits threat between the mobs, the more mobs, the less threat. 
---
Use Battle Shout instead, it gives threat based on the people buffed, so if you buff all 5 of your party (+any pets) that's decent AoE threat. 
---
Don't use Heroic Strike unless you're rage dumping, it's high threat which is nice but it replaces an auto-hit, which means you don't get rage from that hit.
---
It may surprise you how much of your rage comes from your auto-attacks, especially at low levels, even when AoE tanking. So HS can screw you over there. 
---
Use Sunder or Revenge instead, and/or Shield Block to force a Revenge. 
---
I usually do something like
---
* Mark a Skull if there's a high priority target, and a moon if I want or need CC
---
* Charge in and Demo Shout
---
* Drag them back so I'm in range of my team, Battle Shout
---
* Tab around using Revenge &gt; Sunder &gt; Shield Block &gt; Cleave/HS
---
* Apply Battle Shout whenever I've got spare rage
---
* Throw a Taunt or Mocking Blow on anything that gets loose. 
---
Reading up about the wonders of Battle Shout has made Warrior tanking a LOT better than it was in Vanilla.
---
That's just really poor technique in my opinion. It makes it harder to cast spells / use abilities while strafing in a circle, and gives you way less control. The mouse should be controlling the camera at all times.
---
There are already level 60's with epic mounts on your server. That's why it's funny.
---
This toon is a dead ringer for the paladin I rolled back in Vanilla, holy nostalgia.
---
So if you got shot but I didn't get shot you must not have been shot than.
---
everyone always gets these done with their character in tier armor that I question if they actually had or not...just once I wanna see one of someone in the [REAL classic experience](https://imgur.com/a/fTIQik2).

Horde on felstriker OCE server . Guild name is Shamental , shaman only guild. Get ready to see some pog shaman shenanigans fellow oce players
---
&gt;That is, without taking out game systems such as LFG/LFR, etc.
---
You can't restore the social element to a game without taking out the convenience aspects that convert fellow players into disposable bots you will never see again.
---
You could've made it if you diddnt hesitate like a dumbass lol
---
I did lmao
---
also they forget to finish off low hp mobs, they run away and pull more mobs. No kick/silences/interrupts on top of that, likely result very stressful 1-2 minutes of fight with 5-10 elites, drinking healing potions and likely a wipe.
---
Had to look that up “victory or death” is a pretty sick moto
---
Can translate pig Latin into sign language if that helps.
---
It is balanced, the idea is to have zero layers by the end of phase 1 so everyone is playing together.
---
Any good dps won’t have mana by the time the tank pulls

OH, ok, good to know! a guide i read said she gives you the rest, but they sorta implied it as if she had up to 300 recipes. Thank you
---
Are you trying to quote TLC on purpose?
---
A good example is I picked up a quest to go to kalimdor. After doing some other shit I decided nah I'd rather just stick around on this content. That's the way I look at it
---
I’ve killed so many mages while leveling as a warrior. They make one misstep or resist a couple things and sometimes you just 1-shot them. Also, engineering.
---
Hey man, thanks again for making those silk bags for me for free.
---

---
That’s what I love about that 30 min cool down as a Druid. If the group is going well and we’re like outside thermalluggs chambers I’ll brez to avoid us all having to go back because of pats. But otherwise I save it for the heals.
---
Rogue - 75%
---
Warrior - 62.5%
---
Yeah that's really what I thought too. It's killing me how dead this server is compared to all the rest already doing raid content granted I'm not 60 yet but still, would have been alot more motivated to continue the grind. Was level 30 day 3
---
Lol nice one. As for banning, probably not. But you might get reported one day in which case thry will force you to change it.
---
Loktar ogar!
---
Make it so dungeons actually require crowd control and tactics and get rid of the LFG/cross-realm so you actually know the people you adventure with.
---
And fix the classes so that each one is unique and different again.
---

On my Hunter, I like to drop a Freezing Trap and a Flare right underneath me when I stop to attack something.
---
Got my mom to play back in vanilla and she would wreck people who tried to gank her while fishing. Didn't even bother unequipping the fishing pole sometimes because there was no need. Played a mage.
---
How do you know that? Is it the same group from this past weekend?
---
Unique individuals huh?
---
...Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down....
---
Healing dungeons when you're under-leveled is a lot easier than tanking or DPSing since you don't need to worry about having to hit anything
---
Yes, dont do that, bad idea. You cant keep scrollwheel pressed down. Scrolling is like spamming jump super fast.
---
Could I have some bags &lt;3
---
Do you need help with anything in retail besides max level and even Then? Hardly at all? Then no.
---
Just wanted to update this since alt level is a time sink @150 LW, Hillsman's shoulders look like the highest profit margin for vendoring with medium leather.   1 cured med hide, 4 med leather, 1 fine thread = Vendor price 11s99c.
---
Every single time I get an opportunity to play something like this or a internet outage occurs. It's making me wish I would have waited before I got myself readdicted to this game lol
---
Really feel like the air totem quest should have been the asinine one. It was more like "Yeah here, I was tired of holding this thing anyway".
---
I do love the idea and experience as a whole though. I really enjoyed the fire quest personally.
---
I find your name offensive to the gnomes of Azeroth. I think they have suffered enough. I'm pushing for a reddit permaban.
---
But it's not balances going from 5-10 people working around the same quest to 30+ is not a balanced change.
---
That’s a long time
---
Without knowing anything and jumping straight to conclusions.
---
Tank arrogance has peaked especially at 60. The amount of douche canoe tanks I have encountered farming runs at 60 is too damn high. I get it, it’s day 15 so those of us at 60 already are likely pserver vets who took time off. Doesn’t mean you need to or are entitled to act like a complete autismo with no social skills.
---
The amount of times I’ve wanted to click need to teach a douche canoe a lesson in manners..
---

I did and they gave me a generic &gt; YOU SHALL NOT PASS&gt; Response saying they will not be turning over any decisions due to the number of player reports.
---
For the Horde!
---
I disagree.   Spam heals to get everyone back up all at once, so you can sit there regenning even longer
---
What is the controversy I started?? So if I'm a lock with tailoring and decide to roll a mage I shouldn't craft a frost power set or bags from him because it will shave 3 seconds off my kills or reduce the number of times I run to vendor? I don't know how anything we could come up with could trivialize the grind 1-60. I thought this topic would be fun...
---
I need to sell it for gold.
---
&gt;Not sure which part of this is controversial?
---
Randomly despawning a boss for no good reason.

Since I've asked you for a source/citation two times now and you've ignored me both times, I'll go ahead and label you a troll. Good day.

I respect that. I honestly don't understand why people think it's fun to just wipe the floor with every low level they see.
---

---
There is no "balance" the ideal scenario is NO layers. If somewhere is too busy, do something else until it isn't, pretty simple tbh
---
what server are you on?
---
layering fucked the game lol.  tons of top guilds/streamers abused it to get 60 and farm gear that would normally take a lot longer.
---
Is that something you should keep updated with new gear or is there a good boot worth keeping for a long time with the enchant?
---
Going out your way to report a harmless name makes you boring and unfunny

Just tell us that your guild fed you mats already /s.

Not sure if it was Blizzard that made them back them but they are still available through http://www.figureprints.com/wow/

more of this whiny ass bitching.  god i forgot what a bunch of pussies wow players are
---
I know right, far more of a karma hack than I am. I'm concerned about the welfare of the game is all.
---
Only one drink I can see though :/
---
Oh wow. Talk about a blast from the past, pretty sure that's the same company I'm thinking of, and blizzard just advertised it back when I'd seen it.
---
it can't be understated how much the story affects the game. you've already summarized the consistency and coherency aspects, so i'm going to touch a bit on worldbuilding.
---
there are two major problems with bfa worldbuilding
---
[1] the expanse of never-ending threats. yeah, you NEED motivations for expansions and obviously players will keep pressuing you to up the scales. but what happens is, the world is under attack from a gigantic world-ending monster every two years. it leaves you wondering how the residents even cope with this constant peril. and, when everything is THE ONE GUY THAT WILL END ALL LIFE ON AZEROTH, it stops having weight. if everything is the end times, nothing is the end times.
---
[2] in bfa, the world feels incredibly cramped. you get the sense that nothing really happens in a zone before and after you are there, no matter what your mission table tells you. it's very unlikely that you'll visit the same quest giver more than two or three times. the concept of having several little villages you barely stay in vs maybe one or two quest hubs per zone leaves each hub feeling meaningless. in vanilla, each hub is important, and crafted with little details that make it feel more like a living, breathing place (see: the watchmaster in darkshire that is always drunk, the wolf riders in razor/sen'jin, ect). you also revisit zones constantly; see this quest i just got to go visit the centaur quest guy in barrens, who is recruiting soldiers for desolace. you get the idea that he's still been doing things since you left. 
---
i'm just really passionate abt this stuff and bfa's lore is abysmal
---
Which realm?
---
If it's against the rules its against the rules. 
---
And nobody wants to see someone called XxXfUcKuRmOmXxX like it's call of duty
---
Laughs in Enh Shaman with Windfury Pendulum of Doom.
---
Not so much nowadays, but in Vanilla the stereotype (which happened to also hold a lot of, but not all, truth) was that kids played Alliance and adults played Horde.
---
We were older, more jaded and bitter =P
---
More prone to PvP and whatnot, so it was usually the case that Horde would engage in it more frequently, both provoked and unprovoked, etc
---
Lots of Faction-Pride for both sides, though
---

---
&gt;What does "playing incorrectly" even mean.

I don't know what you're doing, but if you aren't MSing when it's off CD, the answer is "something wrong".

---
Can they still kill themself with hellfire or whatever .  It was a sad day when they removed that.
---
I'm the same but it happens as I'm falling asleep. I always come up with irrational plans to allow me to submerge myself in the game. I imagine shit like quitting my job and taking up a part-time position at a service station and just living on 2-minute noodles or converting my basement into a weed growing operation like I'm breaking bad but for the most nerdy reason. 
---
The solution always seems so obvious and simple at the time but then I wake up the next day and drag myself into work like usual.
---
Put your faith in potassium!
---
We did this, but naked, unarmed, and no skills on the action bar.
---
You are expected to do what is needed of your role to complete the dungeon, opening a lockbox is not necessary to finish a dungeon. This is why it's a terribly dumb argument to say "I'll charge for my heals or I'll charge for my soulstone".
---
Am mage. Can confirm this is the best way.
---
Agreed. The group creation tool is fine, my only gripe is it showing item level for a lot of content. I understand for higher lvl mythic dungeons but when I first hit max level in BFA nobody would inv me to shit until I met a certain threshold, like how do I get the gear if nobody runs heroics and nobody invites for world quest grouping?
---
Who mentioned BS? Talking about mining, and the majority of toons leveling right now are just double gathering to make money. 
---
So why is that miner more entitled to get and sell that ore than I am? Just because he leveled it? Then the same applies to lockpicking.
---
I remember awhile back in one of the earlier expansions (cata maybe) that one of the changes was making flight paths less "scenic."
---
So yeah. They're long on purpose
---
it does this in Florida, IRL
---
I thought archimonde and the other demon guys where draenei right? They look quite similar to the TBC ones.
---
I was under the assumption that it was  just two branches of the same race, even in WC3.
---
I feel that personally.
---
Shouldn't you be playing retail?
---
Blizzard needs to stop this. Your overly sensitive-and likely manufactured- feelings/outrage are your problem, not mine not blizzard's.
---

---
I didn't take measures to bypass a profanity filter 😉
---
I had to start selling greens from about 38 to 42 when I finally got my mount. I would never have pulled the money together otherwise.
---
No sleep until you get that winterspring saber mount.
---
Why only 62
---
Some people dont play to be efficient though.
---
This is literally the first one of these posts I agree with. On a non RP server I cannot see this being in any way inappropriate.
---
Well I personally don't think alliance signs are sharp enough, so there.

I have no money between learning abilities and recipe for engineering. I can't wait to get shoulders on my warrior I'm only lvl 17 so far

Im at 21g and just hit 35. No way im getting it by 40. I also chose the gold sink prof Tail/Ench. Oray for me. They're bot at 185 ish and I can't seem to make any money with them.
---
Last time I checked, dps to charge for damage or buffs either. You are expected to do what is needed of your role/class to complete the dungeon and opening a lockbox is not necessary to complete the dungeon.
---
You always write you first, enemy last. So in this case you and another guy killed 1 thing?
---
Classic =/= Vanilla.  
---
There's quite a few things that haven't lined up so far, and I really doubt this will be the last that people notice.  
---
Also, idk if I'm crazy, but I swear characters never used to blink in Vanilla, but they do in Classic.
---
That's not OCD just you being a dumbass

Just did for 30 MINUTES as long as my potion lasted. 
---
Got 34 shellfish  ( Lucked out got the bog iron fishing pole)

Thats 3.84 g pr hour.     Not 70g in a couple hours
---
I did a perfect circle where no one was 6 cages spawned exactly when i got to each one.
---
It does happen a lot.  Also dps not even remotely trying to control agro or focus a main target.  Makes tanking for them super annoying and zero fun.
---
Not to op but to everyone else in general... If you do this to your tank you are an ass.  Lol.  You may not die as most dungeons aren't that punishing so you'll keep doing it but you will slow the run down even if you think you are dps'ing more this way.  The healer will use more mana healing everyone that isn't the tank, will need to drink more for more downtime, won't be able to dps to help out like when the tank holds because he will take much less damage and need less heals.  Had a group last night doing this... planned multiple runs but bounced after the first one because repeatedly telling them to let the tank pull or to focus on skull first is too hard for some dps to understand the benefits of.  Making the tank taunt right away and then try to pick up the rest of the mobs you pulled then losing the one taunted because you are trying to gain aggro on others makes the tanks job a nightmare and i will not tank for you again.  You might not care and I don't either as long as I don't see you again. End rant. 
---
TLDR; Fuck that hunter from last night lol

Trying to get a fishing pole from the shellfish traps on the bottom coast of STV earlier. I’m alliance, so we don’t get a quest for an easy +25 fishing pole, we gotta get it from these fucking traps with a terrible drop rate. 
---
Yet, all I saw earlier was a bunch of horde farming the traps? What gives? To sell on the booty bay AH for 2 gold? Their drop rate is awful and the quest gives you a +25 pole!
---
Meh that’s a fair point. I’m just
---
In the same camp as OP, that a rogue being able to open a locked chest doesn’t guarantee them that chest. Was just using an example but I guess it was a bad one. Ofc I don’t expect anything to do my job!!
---
The healer's spec matters more than the tank's spec.  If you have a friend who regularly heals, make sure they're spec'd for it.  Otherwise, try to get groups with pure Holy/Resto/Disc spec'd healers rather than the hybrid specs most people go with.

I should of known better lol

Yeah memories are usually not accurate.  Your mind can also trick you into believing false memories.

Pro-Tip for Warriors trying to get to the Tram: Charge some of the rats in the Deeprun tram to make haste!

I could totally see kids being more apt to choose Alliance over Horde. The faction-pride is really what is getting me so invested though. You truly want to help out the members of your faction when they are in trouble and I’ve found that whenever I am running from a higher level, players will come to help if they see it. 
---
I have heard that the Horde has better bonuses for PvP or something is that true?
---
thats not Tarren Mill

I remember these....
---
To be fair I have done that before but the accent was not an attempt to bypass. Cleavage without an accent was already taken on the server.
---
If we put the visuals aside the alliance is generally the more preferred faction when it comes to hardcore guilds - and therefore better. PvE, better racials, PvP is a debatable and argument can be made, either way, Alliance BGs see more premades and thus tend to win, maps are always way more Alliance sided.
---
 Horde has better positioning for dungeons etc. more WPvP oriented players tend to go Horde too. 
---
Honestly, roll what you want, but Alliance is better from a min/max point of view.
---
&gt; On the other hand, I saw a guy trying to form a spellcleave group for Ragefire Chasm. He spent at least 30 minutes searching for the last mage -- more time than it would take to clear the dungeon even with a mediocre group.
---
&gt; 
---
That's because when you put together a good spellcleave group you don't just 'clear the dungeon'. Getting to 60 I had groups that would be together all day, taking breaks for meals, then going to bed and starting again in the morning.
---
You play on a PVE server don't you
---
False, rogues are still in the game.

Can't say it's ever been a problem, my keyboard hand doesn't move and my mouse hand is barely touching the desk. I don't get it.

Maybe if they completely removed all the cross server nonsense, they might be able to get a little something back, but it's doubtful. I feel like the current WoW community is mostly just bots going about their business with zero regard to those around them. There's just no reason to interact with anyone, but maybe if people keep seeing familiar faces and getting group with the same people, it might help.
---
They would probably need to merge servers for that to work though. I'm on a very populated RP server that isn't crossed with other servers, and it is absolutely dead everywhere except the most current expansion and major cities.
---
Can't agree more they should spend more time on the next expansion.
---
Well hopefully those alliance dogs will have 1 day of honor and not go crying to their high levels when we trounce them.
---

Just always be picking a mob, mark as necessary protect DPS from it one at a time as they go down. Protect the healer from all the rest.
---
That's all you can do in vanilla, if DPS split all over don't feel bad about it, just keep focused on the order you marked them in and either the DPS will die and learn not to be dumb or the healer will carry them.
---
if you need to heal multiple people use a PoH and a renew on the tank then let 5sr hit.
---
now im 3k in que....can you fix that nonsense too.....
---
Back in Vanilla my priest got his mount at 40, but it was hard fought and a close call.  
---
In Classic I am no where near it, I don't know what the difference is; probably this time I am being more efficient and therefore killing way less stuff so getting less vendor trash, but after skipping way too many spells, and doing everything I can think of, came into 40 with 32g.
---
Very different from when i finished part way through Legion after being the most wealthy in the guild for over a decade.
---
No you didn't. Numbers aren't allowed in names.
---
Same here. Keep getting booted, and now when I log back in it puts me at end of que.
---
lmfao that's some GTA V police officer energy
---
Yes indeed.  I have vowed to return to Hillsbrad at level 60 and defend it.
---
Rogue's dual wield spec talents give +50% to the off-hand, but the warrior only gives +25%

I looked through the code, and the only ways it detects players are target, mouseover, combat log text, and I'm not 100% sure, but I think detect humanoids, which you might need to mouse over the minimap icon for. Do you have Track Humanoids?
---
Also, it communicates between players, so if someone else saw the enemy do something you might just have gotten the notification from that.
---
It is perfectly possible to play WoW while on a conference call, working from home rocks!

&gt;So much for trying to capture that original experience, right Blizzard?

Why are people such passive aggressive crybabies? Like Jesus dude grow a pair.

I mean, without seeing the post this doesn't seem unreasonable. Person complains about something, gets some support, Blizz changes it, turns out *a lot* more people liked it the way it was, they get upset and complain on the forums. It's a tale as old as time.

They would have to remove dungeon finder, raid finder, layering, cross realm play, and flying mounts.  They would also have to add lucrative rewards to the world that cannot be acquired by solo players.

Ahh okay I gotcha. Thanks friend.

No. Cross realm destroyed that. It could have still existed with LFG, but not with cross realm.
---
This is something I have definitely been looking forward to. My first time I really tired WoW was in BC as  a draenei shaman. Long time later I leveled another shaman during MoP and was disappointed to the point to I played something else.

Sorry dude I’ll let you get back to policing names and guilds in a video game, stay triggered cringe lord

Yeah ok we can smell you filthy dirtbags. Least we know what running water can do to hygiene,yyuuuccck!
---
2010 was WoTLK tho, not classic, BC came out in 2007...
---
If it doesn't get a public spotlight then it won't get fixed/reverted.
---
What about STV? That’s a lot of killing there
---
I didnt. The OP and the one I replied to are mostly discussing the infernal aggroing and attacking nearby players, not the aoe mechanic.
---
The infernal aggro was nerfed sometime before TBC, but the aoe damage stayed. You can read where they implemented this in [patch 1.3](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0).
---
&gt; Inferno - The duration the Infernal is enslaved when first summoned has been increased. The area of effect damage caused by the Inferno spell, and all threat generated by it, will now originate from the Infernal. The Infernal will now immediately attack targets within the radius of the spell.

One of the reasons UC is best Horde city. Super hard to figure out but as soon as you do, it's so worth. Actual stone architecture, circular layout, easy to get around. Org and TB are nice, but so much more sprawling and segmented. Had to delete my first toon because i couldn't figure out how to get out.

How much time did it take to learn that skill do you have to actually level it 300 times ?
---
Are you being dense on purpose? You do know it’s not an automatic rogue ability right.
---
Can't believe I never knew about this, so cool
---
My response is stand on the tank and spam drain life. I either drain tank the job or the tank gets it back.
---
I have done the same, but for the Arathi Highlands. I have died around 10 times at the same level! Dusk wood was much easier to level in when it’s all alliance around, but the PvP aspect makes it more fun
---
Good story

800 horde is a joke when Herod is literally 30k Horde at peak times.  Blizzard screwed up by making fresh servers the target of transfer. Why not pick a Medium server instead?
---
&gt; I was surprised to see my fears actually going off on skulls,
---
This is one of the best parts about classic. In retail anyone who is max level will 1 shot a lowbie with a fart. In classic, lowbies actually can add something to giant raids where skulls are present.
---
Anti warlock propaganda, don't believe his lies.

I can't believe the state of the classic community to updoot drivel such as this.

Warlock bros, life tap and tpose on your healer until you are full health

then  do one extra life tap just to show him you mean business.

Knowing Blizzard they probably did change it intentionally. They don't want people abusing it and griefing their own faction.

" Hate speech and discriminatory language is inappropriate, as is any obscene or disruptive language " TOS quote nothing about Sexualized names. Honestly probably the only reason they banned it is bc they are having the bad press about them giving Jaina tits the size of my head on hearthstone and having to "cover" them.
---
Some of them have detection

If you're using bandages between pulls then you have the out of combat regen. Warlocks can't just regen health &amp; mana out of combat with out consumables. Yes you're right that you can exchange life and mana but if you're low on resources between that doesn't devoid you of responsibility to regen out of combat between pulls in a dungeon.  
---
The topic at hand is specifically Warlocks who don't manage their health &amp; mana and get low then don't regen between pulls. If you can keep yourself topped up on mana and health throughout a dungeon through ability use and consumables that aren't food/water then this explicitly does not apply to you.  
---
If you think when you and the healer are both completely OOM between pulls that just standing there life tapping and nothing else is managing your regen properly, it's not.   
---
Like the whole point OP is making here is that many Warlocks do not employ "siphon life, drain life, healthstone, bandages, potions, life tap, and dark pact." to keep themselves topped up and go low resources without ever popping a consumable.
---
There's no way they could have made as many full CGI scenes as they did in game cut scenes. That WOULD have cost raid tiers.

I agree, but it's the only thing I can come up with that doesn't take away the things they added. Look what happened when they threatened to take away flying mounts, it was a complete shit storm. The current community isn't going to stand for them taking any of the plush features they are accustomed to.
---
And yes, if the leaks for the next expansion are true, it will be really interesting to see where they go from there..... however, they could just throw out everything that happened in Shadowlands and pretend like it never happened, like they do with every other expansion. ;D

Yeah, rogue stealth is better and overall DPS too. Druids have better over all mobility though. Well I reckon anyway. :-)

Hate to disagree but I don’t know what you expected really... throwing my support to Blizzard on that one.
---
I agree, except the flying mounts. Burning crusades still has an amazing social aspect with flying being limited to a certain area. In addition to what you stated, they would also need to remove cash shop stuff, as well as find a way to revamp the way endgame gear is accrued

*Looks at Thrall talking a big game about peace and diplomacy while tacitly supporting the Warsong Outriders, throwing his hands up and saying "I can't do anything to stop them!"*
---
Horde talks a big game about honor and pride, truth is, that's only when it's convenient to them. 
---
Their "Warchief" is a hypocrite, and the rest are no better.
---
Dude. I literally said, "We don't even have to do the real math here." Implying that I didn't do any math. Don't be a dick. Just follow Wheaton's law and make your case. Plus all these posts are so out of order anyways. I feel like I've seen you reply differently to my other posts in this very same thread this morning and yet here you are hours later attacking a different old post like I somehow rebutted you.
---
Now on to your data. You're wrong and I'll tell you why. Because you're not taking actual mob HP into account for each encounter. You're mathing out % hp when different level warriors with different weapons are hitting different level mobs with varying degrees of armor. This completely negates the notion that some(most) mobs you're fighting are going to die faster than sunder becomes worth it.
---
As many others have already pointed out, AND as I basically admitted in another post in this thread, the subject is a lot more nuanced than rage efficiency per damage. I confessed that there are some situations when you might prefer to sunder. A soft rule might be orange mobs or certain high HP yellow mobs like some crocs in STV. These are mobs you're going to swing at more than a few times and you get progressively more damage from sunder as the fight goes on (to extrapolate, theoretically you max at 5 stacks and then could continue to spend rage on other damaging abilities and get both worlds). 
---
In these cases however, we're talking about someone giving bad advice to ALL players in a new server environment. I simply don't think it's good faith to tell people they should be sundering and never(rarely) using HS. If you think that blanket statement is still true, then I don't know how else to make a case to you.
---
Don't talk to me about rage efficiency. I'm not arguing or disagreeing. Don't talk to me about the importance of sunder over longer fights. Duh. If you can Charge a green mob, HS it twice and its dead or near dead...you shouldn't be sundering it. End of story. Leave your private server elitism in gchat.
---
For the Icy Chill enchants?

Are they doable with adds though?

Easy way to make money too.
---
The sign is multipurpose you see, it shows direction and allows us to slam Alliance scum into it for brutal glory kills.
---
But Gnomes have as much HP as Nelves. 
---
Corpses should instead give HP according to their class
---
I don't know, i've wiped a few groups with divine intervention already.
---
But if you start the fight with full health and mana you can still use your healthstone in a pinch, tap way more freely in mid fight when it really matters, have way more health to not be in danger of dying and have way more gas in the tank to power through enemies. Healthstone is awesome and valuable whether or not you start the fight very weak.  
---
There are so many mechanics that can prevent a tank from being able to pull a mob off you and Locks are clothies that you are absolutely creating unnecessary failure conditions by starting fights weak even if you have a healthstone ready to go.
---
They're never going to make a WoW 2. There's no reason to.
---
The closest thing we'd get is pristine servers.
---
I'm pretty sure people have 5 manned onyxia. That means theres 35 places that can be filled with suboptimal builds. 
---
People often confuse viable with optimal. Sure am enhancement shaman isn't optimal but you can still clear everything with some enhancement shamans in the raid, so they're still viable.
---
Wait to Phase 2. They won’t because you get a dishonorable kill. So it’s time to have the fun now.
---
Graveyard til 34?  There are like no elites in there I was hardly getting 10% in there at 32.

Library just seems too long to make it really good.  I was thinking Armory was at 34, is that not?
---
Respec your pet for maximum shadow resistance and I'd also recommend dash/dive.  
---
Have a bow and weapon set at the same speed for melee weaving (if you haven't tried it before, it's not too hard, perfect time to practise!)  
---
\- Use a weapon swing timer  
---
\- Set a macro !Attack to your mouse wheel down  
---
\- Set a macro !Auto Shot to your mouse wheel up  
---
\- Use Cheetah
---
Open with SS then auto down while pet attacks. You will get up to around 30-34k xp/hr
---
No one ever said it makes them better. You're just putting words in the mouths of other people in order to cope with the fact that you accidentally rolled in a pvp server.
---
What up? We're three cool guys who are looking for other cool guys who want to hang out and grind together on a regular basis. Nothing sexual. Dudes in good shape encouraged. If you're fat, you should be able to find humor in the little things. Again, nothing sexual.
---
Did they nerf their stats/abilities in PvP? Infernals could change the tide of a PvP battle.
---
If they added in Pristine servers, sure.
---
I don't think they'll take away LFR/LFG. Too much of their base enjoys those featues.
---
Uhm, actually, you’re doing it wrong. You’re supposed to be auctioning items below vendor price, and or at price, so that you’re losing money! That’s the classic way
---
Heartseeker definitely isnt dead despite showing low pop. Plenty of groups and the populations been growing steadily. This next round of transfers will help a lot though especially for non peak hours.

In Tanaris, there are two quests. One involves the [beacon](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8623/oox-17-tn-distress-beacon) to go to OOX-17-TN in the southeast part of Tanaris to rescue him and one involving [Tooga and his quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1560/toogas-quest)
---
Once you loot the beacon, accept the quest so that it's there southeast. Then you do Tooga's Quest southwest because it is on a 30 minute timer.  Lead Tooga to where OOX-17-TN is and start it. From cat form Tooga to beacon took about 7-8 minutes with 3-4 adds and from beacon to Steamwheedle Port, where they both end, in total took about 23-25 minutes with two sets of adds the beacon "summons".
---
thank you.
---
I just give locked chests to rogues. Normally it gets skipped anyways so o really don't care
---
When I say guild I mean like, our 2 people who play regularly and some casuals. 
---
In my opinion, yes it is kind of a big deal.  The language barrier has been rough in my experience.  A lack of communication has been evident in the last 2 DM runs I have done.  
---
Also, I’m trying to learn a lot about the game, so I don’t think it’s very conducive to learning.  
---
Personally, I would just prefer to understand everything in general/trade chat and be able to communicate with all group members.
---
Heeey! Releasing the infernal to create havoc was and is a big part of the warlock experience!
---
YEA! The horde pop on arugal is horrible and they're always picking on unfair fights. Love it when rogue try to stealth walk up to my lvl 33 warrior with human perception. and get melted with a single overpower. RIP your orc enemy who doesn't know how to use berserker rage to fear immune.
---
Fuck now I have to go watch the trailer
---
I could watch these for hours lmao
---
I was a 52 druid at the time, so I wouldn't recommend solo'ing it unless you can sustain yourself or do it with a group. Since the beacon for the quest to start drops for everybody in the party, it's easy to sync up.
---
Maybe you should use it sometimes.
---
Mainly for XP but sure, loot can't hurt!
---
Curious as to how many people play with sound on these days.
---
As a youngin I always played eq/eq2/vanguard with sound on and listened to the epic sountracks.. but back then I only had 1 monitor.
---
Nowadays I play on my main monitor and have 2 others so music/ambience instanlty gets muted in game and I turn sound effects down just enough so they arent loud enough to distract me but still can be heard underneath either my spotify music or youtube video podcasts.
---
Sooo, it takes money to lose money.
---
How sad that people pvp in a pvp based game :'(
---
Funny I got ganked repeatedly in STV by Alliance ?? however many levels above me yesterday...
---
Aspect of the Pack
---
It’s just a guideline.  Basically when mobs are higher level than you, they become increasingly more difficult to hit.  This is bad for DPS and really bad for tanking, because you can’t hold aggro.  But if you think you can handle it, go for it. 
---
Graveyard is really easy, so you need to pull huge packs and aoe them down to make it worth running.
---
My first thought. 
---
On the one hand its beyond my comprehension on the other I love. #lifechoices
---
what did I just read
---
You don't get DK for killing lowbies. Do some research
---
You don't need to wait that long, unless you're new to aoe farming
---
Wetlands is your best bet. Raptors, murlocs, and gnoll camps (easiest ones to group). You can stay in wetlands until like 28
---
Luna Ui mod has one built in. That's what I use
---
And that detects always?
---
Looking good bro, lookin reeeeeal gooood.
---
OP is literally only asking their Warlocks to eat between pulls and is explicitly telling them to life tap away midfight as needed.
---
I do love the class quests.  Even the stupid ones like the Druid poison cure quest.  Nevermind the fact that you get a better version like 4 levels later, but it’s the experience that’s nice.
---
I never understood why we can't get away with charging for stuff like summons. I imagine its because in order to collect, we have to render services first and they are under no obligation to pay after the fact.
---
Wrong time line but still awesome!
---
Wpvp as shadow is very fun. In AV? Not so much as you get viper stinged every 10 seconds by 20 hunters.
---
Stop being such a drama queen it's not "that" bad that "everytime" your "experience" is ruined. Chances are people are pulling because you don't mark the mobs or just play with old-man-walking speed.
---
This is definitely a bait post
---
I don't really understand the mechanics but don't the rogue and druid get plus 5 to stealth every level and the rogue just has the option to get an extra few levels of stealth in their talent tree? Or is there more at play?
---
I guess im wrong but I swear I saw rose petals raining down sometime when tbc first released (when I first joined) but otherwise this was my favorite lil moment for a long time

Who is more pathetic? The alliance player for slapping the ungrateful horde? Or the ungrateful horde accepting the WoW version of a handout from the enemy faction?

The one on the right would be a good pen holder
---
When a player in a group deliberately goes against what the group wants, you kick them. Simple.
---
No it's in southern Ashenvale.
---
I get what you’re saying, but aren’t you essentially just asking them to reboot all of WoW in this case?
---
There would need to be 2 development teams creating full expansions for this and also how would it handle the “vanilla only” backlash from others?
---
Not bashing you just genuinely curious about the future of these servers in 2+ years
---
If your in an AoE group and drinking   doing it wrong, only the shitty meleecleave groups you will need to drink.

Low levels get ganked so when they level up they gank low levels it's the circle of pvp

Blizzard has also finally responded to the Linux thread as well.  I am glad to see Liam has posted this up as well.  There is a lot of visibility there, WoW staff have assured us the issue is on their radar now and being looked into.  I would expect a resolution soon.

Unorganized Organising
---
Doesnt work with classic. You can use the game time earned but that's it.
---
what other grief tools were removed besides warlock infernal, which could be a bug?
---
Troll is especially good on a healer in pvp, as when you get low hp is when you really need that faster cast rate on your big heals.
---
So undead is the best pvp race in the game, but a troll healer isn't too far behind.
---
The low pop servers are far from dead, and the populations are still rising, in feel sorry for the people who have to wait in hour+ long queues while sharding is still in place. There'll be a lot more posts about overcrowding on those high/full pop servers once phase 2 hits and sharding is gone.

My question is WHY WILL NO ONE LET ME FUCKING LAST HIT ANYTHING?
---
I swear half the players turn into mongoloids when a mob has sub 10 precent health. That's the ONLY time everyone can focus. 7 other things completely full? Fuck that?! am I right. LETS ALL keep dumpstering the ONLY baddie about to die. 
---
I swear the moment I ask for last hit is when people double down on NOT letting me have it. I've seen more melees pull an entirely separate pack by "chasing down" low health baddies. 
---
In fact I've seen it more then IVE SEEN MYSELF GET LAST HIT IN ANY FUCKING DUNGEONS.

That's not real pvp, it's trolls be trolls.  Seems like an adequate fix to me.  If you are going to be a useless human being killing characters 40 levels below you, at least have the balls to do it in enemy territory.

They did not, I remember doing this in BC as well

See I’ve visited several trainers and none have rank 1 of cursed agony available! Only rank 2 and I need rank 1 first lol

Not quite my charge path.

I recommend leveling by getting a bunch of warriors, a shaman, and a priest. Make sure the shaman and warriors have ravager and just spam SM. Then you just keep spinning and blowing up the mobs. It’s called the meat spin method. If you go to meatspin.com you can find guides and videos on how to do it.

I didn’t have really good and consistent groups until ARM/Cath. All the groups for GY and LIB were just standard pull a few mobs and kill them. If your referring to the big AoE pulls those didn’t happen till Arm and cathedral. At 33? I wouldn’t e even really do GY would go for ARM/LIB groups.

From my experience it's time based. Ie if I fish in Feralas between midnight and noon server time I get fish. As soon as noon hit this morning I got empty loot boxes

Multiple characters at once though. I fail to see how that is a legal way to play. It's so cheaty.

I am from this server noggenfogger. It seems to be full of people who grabbed the first server that was on "low" and the funny name was our reason. So we have this community there because of the server's name. Shout out to my noggers.

So I tried playing for the other side, wanted a male Undead mage on Grobbulus just for kicks. Level 1 starting area, immediate upon logging in, two naked female undead run upon me spamming “SEX” and emoting /point and running upon me and chasing. I spammed /spit and ran from them for a good 5 minutes before they left me alone.

Gross misandric undead scum, I promptly logged off and went back to my main Night Elf Rogue on another server. Fuck the horde and fuck undead scum, kill some undead for me tonight.

Thank you for listening to my rant.

There is just no rule against it. They are paying for all accounts so they can basically do as they please with them

Or whether or not I need this marriage and kids.

I am not a fast leveler nor am I good at getting gold. I doubt I’ll have to wait a long time at 60
---
You are the tank. Make the group. Find a healer using /who or channels and then dps fills instantly. You are tank and grp lead. You set the tone!
---
The turtles out there drop decent yield stuff. 2g in 10 minutes might have been a slight exaggeration unless you get an uncommon, but I would estimate realistically if you farmed them for an hour(being able to kill them in 10-15 seconds), including money from green drops, you'd be surprised at how much you made.

Rogues have distract and yes they can get 15 stealth points from talent tree.

Between those 15 points, you can also get 5 points from being night elf, 5 from nightscape boots, and 5 from (if your rich) cloak Enchant.

Effectively putting you at the stealth of a lvl 66 unit.

---
What's your ingame name I'll dip into your DM.
---
That's actually a legit way to make money as a warlock. It's been done before and nobody has had a problem with it.
---
There's definitely a difference between DPS that pulls aggro and can handle the resulting mob pressure, and DPS that pulls aggro then panics and/or blames the tank.  
---
I agree that strategies shouldn't conform to tradition just "for feels" and DPS shouldn't have to wait to blast mobs as long as they can manage the consequences.  As a healer I don't wanna have to worry about a mage getting chunked to 40% because they were careless, neither do I wanna see 3 humanoids "Running away in fear" while the mage can't finish them off cuz oom. 
---
TL;DR: Don't try to DPS like a pro if you can't mob manage like a pro.
---
I would go With rockpounder. Raw dps and crit chance. The aoe in the ravager is not that a big deal, specially for paladins that like good aoe
---
The reason it is allowed is because people that multibox pay for multiple subs every month (and in the case of retail multiple copies of bfa). As long as they do not use any software that interferes with or modify game files, then then are not breaking the rules.
---
It was in the stress test.  I don’t know why they took it out.
---
&gt;Multiple characters at once though.
---
There's nothing wrong with creating multiple subscriptions and paying each month for them.
---
So what's wrong with using all 5 of them at once?
---
&gt; I fail to see how that is a legal way to play
---
Because no rules are being broken, and there's nothing against hte ToS. 
---
I'd suggest reading up the ToS/agreements, if you find any breaches then link them to prove it's illegal, otherwise you're just making assumptions. 
---
&gt;It's so cheaty.
---
It really isn't. There's absolutely no cheating going on and they're on the same playing field as you.

Likely the easiest grind at the level. For a hunter, you can't kill them fast enough, most of the time is spent running to the next ghost.

Interesting. Might have to let Blizz know if it's on their end. I wonder why it's not a widespread issue then. Before this thread I hadn't seen anyone talking about it.

This is why you wait till everyone is rezzed before you loot...

It’s allowed. Multi-boxing has always been allowed in the last 15 years.

Just avoid them, blizzards allows it as they control them and it's not automated.  They pay 75 a month to run 5 shamans, whatever.  Helps pay the bills and pad classic stats I guess so we get to keep playing what we like and hopefully push to classic+/tbc/wow2.
---
I have no issue with that, but it just seems really unfair that you can control all at once to win. It feels like it is an abuse. I just cannot fathom how controlling multiple accounts at once isn't disallowed.
---
i assume its because you've got either t or shift+t bound to default, macro like this will not work for a combination that is taken in keybindings
---
And Oh Lawd, Now I comin too!
---
You can change it in interface
---
Needs L35 to take it I believe.
---
Slacking on your dagger skill though, man. 
---
For real though, hello fellow whitemane horde!
---
westfall, loch modan, redridge, elwyyn forest, teldrassil, duskwood, basically all the human zones are top tier as well as some of the dwarfs and night elves. It's more European vibes, and has some really cool questlines.
---
Recorded with Microsoft Powerpoint.
---
Looks like you are either using TukUI or ElvUI, looked more like ElvUI to me.
---
In the options you can disable the Partyframes under "unitframes"
---
yeah doing that atm, but wanna try and get that epic mount :P
---
The sun has set and the Shadow has risen.
---
Well done.
---
QWES I picked up back in 2003 from my friends broher who was a UT Pro back then. I'm not sure why he used QWES but for me it it's just way more comfortable and easier to reach the numbers and tilde.
---
 Very few mages are aoe leveling because it’s so crowded. The only aoe leveling is being done in dungeon cleave groups.
---
This sub is full of people who scan read for buzzwords to be offended by and then completely ignore the actual topic.
---
Yes it's worthwhile to enchant whites for Alts, I usually wind up using the level 6 white gear with end game enchants, a white level 1 and level 6 weapon with crusader / LS / Fire on it and rarely replace anything with stuff outside of instance blues at 16+. 
---
After that I just sent over pieces like you say, frostweave, etc for my mage and so on but I always keep the enchanted whites as they're reusable.
---
Yeah AQ was as far as I got, mostly focused on pvp and was just invited along as an extra for all the raids I got into. Never took it seriously until BC. I just can't wait to be a tanky ass little gnome.
---
It's raid frames in options.  Turn it off for less than 10 man content or just off all the way.
---
Omen will give you sword spec procs.  Satyrs lash won't.
---
Think that’s ur server dude. Bigglesworth uc is filled to the brim
---
Very nice. My friends and I did the same thing as you guys, but we were on Kritonos. The Horde set up a raid on Darkshire, so we formed a huge Alliance militia to push them back. Funny thing is... we won! They hearthed out with rez sickness. We fought from Duskwood to Red Ridge for over three hours. We formed a guild afterwards too for everyone that wanted to do it again. Good to hear that other people are doing the same.
---
Hey good to hear! I thought of this and have started trying to buff both the player and the pet, but I was never really sure how helpful it was. Cool!
---
I don't feed my temp pets, so if they make it back to town I'm utterly surprised, had to go and tame some temp raptor while doing the wetlands iron dwarves because my croc despawned
---
But it should aggro all centaurs in a 50 yes radius, since you’re skinning their friend.
---
Would've is a word generally
---
I just use Quartz.
---
Everyone gets a message in chat of "honor gained" when they get an HK. This isn't secret information that casuals don't have access to.
---
This was my plan to undertake tomorrow. Im farming whelps at level 32 in swamp when went to stonard to mail.  I got the quest to go to Badlands and realized no one other than mobs are gonna fuck with me right now. The zones are as under populated as they will ever be for the next couple months while I hit 60. Might as well check out the old chain volcano and grab some FPs.
---
These amuse me greatly
---
Big if true
---
Should be Screenspace Reflection and the sails probably ain't rendered in deferred shading ,so it doesn't get to the G-buffer.
---
So the SSR won't get their data to draw the relection in the post process.
---
It varies depending on current market. But on my server right now I can sell at stack for around 2g on average. Thats about twice what you get for them on Horde AH on my server. A few weeks ago it was even more exorbitant. I think I sold a couple of smaller stacks at a rate close to 4-5g per stack. 
---
Only drawback is the Goblin AH sales tax (30%). But even given the tax, its still more profitable than the Horde AH.
---
I take no issue with them having multiple accounts and I know it isn't against the rules. How on earth is it a level playing field? Controlling  more than one character simultaneously to one shot someone is not a level playing field imo.
---
can someone explain the PvP server?  I am on one, and I thought it was a free for all, however I see you still need to be flagged for PvP to participate.
---
Just keep on leveling. I got my mount at 43 and enough for a second mount at 48.
---
wc3 had in engine in-game cut scenes...if you tried to watch all the wc3 cinematics in a row it doesn't give a coherent story, at least half the cut scenes are not CGI cinematics...
---
You can't poly someone's tagged target either. It's almost certainly intentional nerfing.
---
Both exist but I don’t know the console command so FurtherNameplates is an addon.  
---
Not sure if the space in the name is there or not.
---
Most players unbind turn these days and just use the mouse. This gives you the freedom to use the mouse while avoiding things.
---
What's the UI add-on that's giving you your hit times?
---
And Elwynn General chat for that matter.
---
Whats so fun?
---
isn't grobbulus the rp server? i can see that happen, as in retail on some rp servers, goldshire inn is a place to avoid at night.
---
Herod?
---
You'll probably learn how to do some rogue stuff if you complete it.
---
I dunno though. Just guessing.
---
Yeah I got the vibe as well, but alliance (at least on my server) seems to hate it / doesn't even know it exists. It's all Deadmines and Stockades for them.
---
Irrelevant assuming all he cares about is how populated servers are within his chosen time window
---
Except you are missing the main point: If you are camping someone for 1 honor, you are not in another zone killing a fresh target for full honor. You are wasting your time because someone who occasionally kills a fresh target will gain more honor than someone who gets 10x the kills but on the same 2 people.
---
I joined my first guild today. I thought I got a group invite and clicked Accept without reading it. Some jerk had spammed the whole zone with guild invites via some addon. Half the zone must have done the same thing, as a dozen others had /gquit before I'd looked up the command and done so myself.
---
It’s basically a dnd dungeon crawl.. so this is accurate.
---
Stalagg
---
Some of us use Q and E to strafe in all games.
---
It would be a goldmine of references about playing a game again after 15 years
---
i remember doing it in vanilla, mostly the searching for it, but i forget wtf it was for. i could look it up but im actually gonna try it tomorrow i just got it tonight
---
How dare you not have rattlegore on there! #rattlegang #budgetadvertising
---
Yeah it looks ugly but it works better. At the end of the day is up to you, I prefer the functionality.
---
I'm betting my first 100 gold the first female president of the USA will be Kim Kardashian
---
I like your UI dude, its clean
---
Username checks out

&gt; Make it so dungeons actually require crowd control and tactics
---
This already exists in Mythic+ dungeons.
---
Add a toddler into the mix and drink some Mt. Dew for the seventh ring of chaos.
---
True, it does skip animations and sounds, but if you focus on the swing bar only it doesnt really matter. The audio feedback isnt there but at least you can see it on the addon.
---
Ah, I forgot about that.
---
Viewport ftw.
---
 come join the party mansion. Again, nothing sexual.
---
40 and to 50 i believe but i could be wrong. I know it starts at 40 at least!
---
Pve servers are taking transfers
---
It's allowed because it doesn't really impact game economy that much and blizzard is getting paid for each character.
---
The emphasis is most definitely on the second part.
---
I have yet to be attacked by anyone withing my level range unless it's a group. There are too many people out there and the competition for quest mobs is far more intense
---
This is the one
---
My blueberry does this all the time, he's got some... issues...
---
Ganked from someone who cant even get a bandana? Please..
---
How many skills are you buying? On my hunter I probably bought 1 new skill rank every 4 levels on way to 60.
---
&gt;would of
---
Why do you have to trigger me 10 mins into the day?
---
I... did this in the exact same spot about 12 years ago.. amazing.
---
meanwhile i was in echo isles last night.
---
*record scratch, time stops, looks at camera*
---
Yep. That’s me. I bet you’re wondering how I got into this situation.
---
Wourld’ve Warcraft
---
Oh shit I’m dumb I mean nameplate
---
I think you've just explained why they didn't leave it in.
---
Having a Classic experience is one thing, purposely leaving in something only used for griefing is completely different.
---
Have to do character unstuck I think
---
Yes, you can. But I’ve never met a mage that charged me for water in a dungeon group. Because only a shitty person would do that.
---
Just make sure to blast them on your servers chat
---
I meant name plate sorry
---
Yes. They should have an eye floating over them when you’re in stealth.
---
Did you release?  If you lay there dead it pops up I thought.  If you release you are too far away generally and not included.
---
Sounds like a case of talk shit get hit
---
&gt;It's short for would've, obviously.
---
It's not.
---
Nah. This was good. Playing through the campaign, growing a connection to Arthas as a hero with a mission. The campaign was excellent in itself. By the end of it your hero,a hero you built, commits betrayal and all you can do is watch. It's beautiful.
---
Yeah I have a lot of fun making stuff for people.
---
Guess I was asking if quests that turned green in the log automatically went down/didn’t give  exp or not because you are already a higher level above it was my question. 
---
And okay sweet. Sorry the last mmo I played if you didn’t complete all the quests or quest lines you would be down about 2 or 3 levels from the end cap and be pretty impossible without crazy grinding to hit it.
---
Me too! But I did get like 4 other characters to at least 10 so that probably didn't help. I've decided Hunter for now and then I might use it to keep my warrior geared and level it next.
---
Not really a wow movie innit
---
I've been gaming with Bain since about 2015 and talk to him nightly on Discord. I think you just made his life with this post LOLOLOL
---
you fool
---
Yeah its pretty bad, STV is an absolute mess for alliance players at peak times.
---
I got told by a priest to life tap *more*, and they'd cast renew on me. I think it all comes down to preference and communication.
---
Now it's time to drop mining and level Engineering!
---
Regular fires like inn fireplaces do. Campfires put down by players do not
---
bump
---
Nice
---
Where do you find these sense packa of mobs.? The last couple of nights I've been mostly running around hoping to tag something
---
&lt;Lords of the Realm&gt;
---
It’s an old rts game
---
Ditto
---
&gt; How on earth is it a level playing field?
---
Because the player still needs to level up those characters, equip them, keep them healed/mana'd, and use them just like your character. 
---
They haven't done anything that gives their characters an unfair advantage over your own character. 
---
&gt;Controlling more than one character simultaneously to one shot someone is not a level playing field imo.
---
This is no different to 5 friends on Discord co ordinating to land 5 pyroblasts/frost shocks/chain lightnings/etc. Sure the timing is a bit better, but you can essentially replicate the same thing with a few friends. 
---
The key difference is that messing up one of the 5 characters causes the entire process to mess up, so there are ways to deal with it if you look at the issue instead of just complaining about it.
---
Everyone and their mom is making bags for free. We tailors aren’t making any more money than you are.
---
how long has it been since you used elvUI? the last week has been great update after great update. if you haven't tried it in the last week, you should give it another shot
---
Contested zones are free for all
---
WoW is an MMORPG, though.
---
Any rogue that picks a fight with a warrior isn't a smart rogue, unless they are 4 to 5 levels higher.
---
Got mine at 16
---
Wish I read that 2 days ago. I have paid the price for my ignorance :(
---
How to beat most multiboxers: use any fear, aoe fear works best, get a rogue to sap 1, polymorph, etc. Put them away from eachother or get an actual group to jump them and it falls apart pretty easily. Yes you get nuked if you run into them solo but that's no different than running into any other group solo.
---
With it being one person controlling 5 though it's easier to beat than 5 independent people since they all rely on being next to eachother and use the same keystrokes/macros.
---
Getting griefed does not in any way cause "personal growth" lmao you're so salty
---
Twitch?
---
I've been leveling war and loving it! I played druid in original and loved it but am also loving the glory of smashing shit as a warrior. Also, herbalism and good gear and kind strangers have saved my ass countless times
---
gnome warlock. just finished darkshore and hit menethil. same problem. waypoint is 20,000 yards away and doesnt tell me where it wants me to fly to lol
---
It’s obvious that he needed the momentum of running down hill.
---
And honestly the entire point of infernals and doomgaurds is to troll people. There is no situation in the game where it is advantageous to have out an infernal or doomguard over a normal summon so the only use they have is to try and kill your friends by tricking them into clicking the death portal or dropping infernals on their Bank alts.
---
I mean that's one reason to keep investing time. It is basically the same reason a lot of people use to keep playing retail with every new expansion, they may as well keep playing because of how much time they have already invested.
---
But feeling like something is worth it is a feeling, and it's something you only know when you put in the time
---
Server Herod? Nope! Mograine EU
---
Heh yea I missed some rolls back in Vanilla due to this. Dont release if loot is gonna be rolled on soon
---
Those aren't bottomless bags.
---
Strangest assortment of spells I have ever seen on a shaman UI (I’m a 60 shaman on Arugal).
---
Well what aspects of your game experience do you want changed?
---
It absolutely happened.
---
If a Rogue wants to roll for a locked chest, I'm all for it. If not, that's fine too.
---
I remember world buffing for cthun and someone got chucked off the zep when it loaded. Lost buffs
---
Wait a minute. The currency in WoW goes Gold, Silver, and the Copper. Or have I been wrong all these years? Never heard the smallest unit referred to as Bronze lol
---
What add on is that for the health bars?
---
ElvUI has mouseover keybind support
---
I wish you would have used would've instead of would of.
---
just choose a normal name. you can be the legolas of your server, for the love of god (or a deity of your choice) just leave the zoomer shit :)
---
I'm guessing for Axe Specialization talents which give +5% crit.
---
I wish I had a book bound in human skin.
---
And the whole time the dps are talking about how the tank isn’t doing their job.
---
You need to catch up on real life... Geezuz
---
I think it's because you get ww axe at 30 and ravager at 39 and having the skill for it already is good to have time
---
I'm not even gonna try and understand this one lol
---
??
---
As a fellow Dwarf priest like OP. Dont apologize. It's part of the dang game.
---
And look at how much fun he had because of it
---
Why would I do that on the first place?
---
Because you'll have to kill fewer Syndicate jerk faces if you want a certain title in six years.
---
On the other hand, you certainly need to feed it more than once every two hours so when you're done moving the goalposts and saying 'reading comprehension' you can come to the terms that you were wrong in the first place.

inb4 someone tells you that you should have taken a screen shot with the print screen key

If you dont want to lose your characters you could always use the free transfer to Netherwind. That one seems to be medium - high pop.  Not sure about much else of the server

---
Cast bar, nameplates, and i have the enemy health bar about their name.
---
Well.. there has to be ways to profit from leather working otherwise what's the point of even leveling it?
---
They are slower and as a result your abilities will deal more damage per use.
---
Faster weapons are better for rage generation in dungeons however.
---
ohhh shit i figured it out. type /aap skip twice and itll tell you to go to loch modan w/ the flight path. once that pops up click the flightmaster at menethil and you're good to go
---
I saw that. I prefer the look of TukUI though. Any chance I could load ElvUi and legit turn everything off except the keybinding? Lmao
---
It's a personal choice for everyone. People are trying to level. It seems wasteful to engage. I had a paladin who kept trying to fight me and I just fear me and he would agor some moba while feared. So he runs away. Comes back a few minutes later. I fear him again and I'm free to kill a few more mobs. Now if we got up for killing folks that would be a different story.
---
I think it just has to do with their being a lot of good options for slow 2h axes. Also, arms warrior gets +5% crit with axes.
---
Dude there are like 10001 guides on this topic tell me you didn't Google it first before making an entire Reddit post lol

Blood plague was fixed within 48 hours. It was an unintended bug.

This got fixed too, it's an unintended bug.

Being able to same-faction grief is not an "RPG element".

---
I gotta admit I let it happen to me yesterday. Just a general STV /1 "Alliance are ganking everyone at Hemet\`s camp, lets group up and get them!"
---
Queue some genius "IF YOU DON\`T LIKE PVP SERVERS PLAY PVE!"
---
Toxic guy was constantly talking to people like that with similar stupid quips.. There is a difference between PVPing and trying to join together versus running constantly into camping group of alliance over and over again.
---
Yeh he\`s on ignore forever.
---
I don't think it makes any distinction to whether you're the right level to wear it, only that you can. Likewise, you can roll need on an axe even if you don't have ace training, as long as your class can wield axes.
---
Rattlegore represent!
---
The difference is lockpocking is a skill like a profession that needs to be leveled up, it's not like a soulstone/summon/water that are simply learned by being X level. They put the time to leveling it they can charge to use it the same as if they were an engineer with a blasting charge.
---
Once this game is up and running there will effectively be no difference between retail and classic in terms of those running costs. It will run on the same infrastructure with the same game management tools and same support staff. New content being made is a separate issue if the numbers fall off, but that's not a concern right now.
---
Axes generally have higher top end damage as well when you spec arms for leveling (which you should) Axe specialization gives you 5% crit and when you get enough points to get MS then go to cruelty you can get around 20% crit fairly easy which is pretty nice for leveling.
---
I saw BiggleTiddies too, that is also a solid one.
---
I only had the 2nd one. I was too young to figure out how to play it properly but I loved it anyways.
---
"I refuse to admit I was wrong so I'm going to claim you're moving the goalposts"

yikes

---
Horde!
---
You asked what was the point of leveling it.
---
Oh Lawd he fast
---
I played WoW for the first time a few months before BC. I leveled up a 60 from level 40 to 60 with dual gut rippers. It was amazing. Even at 60 I remember in Alterac Valley I'd go to the backline and one shot all the softies. Particularly remember a gnome mage who was eating his little pastry snack when I got him from behind. Fond, fond memories of Gut Ripper.
---
Need before greed takes level into account as well, meaning the 30 mage couldnt roll on 31 staff
---
I feel this every time we wipe a dungeon
---
Toggle and everyone is happy.
---
Finish off STV, Dustwallow, Badlands. Then transition to feralas/tanaris.
---
This is from horde side, but I'm 99% sure all those zones are shared. I think mid 40s hinterlands has a lot of quests for you too.
---
I just look for quest clusters on questie and check their levels.
---
I would like to know this also.
---
Lol why are you here?
---
I thought it would be better to use to get better at kiting, but oh boy was I wrong :c
---
slang for *p*rostate *p*ass
---
i agre with this. STV has been waiting on mobs to spawn in basically the entire zone where 2-3 groups each of horde and alliance are waiting at each one
---
Poor as warrior here.  Can confirm, first aid is my only profession.  Mageweave bandages are covering 2/3 my health...it’s nice.
---
Your wrong on this one. Soulstones, water, etc are all learned by simply being X level they are very different from locking picking Locking picking is something the rogue has to spend hours leveling up like a profession which makes it acceptable albeit a dick move to charge for opening.
---
They are amazing climbers, they run faster than any athlete (and can run very long distances), they have a very keen sense of smell, they are among the strongest non-marine carnivores, and they are pretty clever on top of that.
---
So yeah, bears are amazing. If it weren't for the facts that they are not felines, they would probably be the most awesome mammals on this planet :D
---
are you talking about fearing in dungeons? never fucking do that
---
A group of five players attacking you would kill you just as easily as one person controlling 5 accounts, haha
---
Is your map opened up when you aggrod the mob? That's when it seems to happen to me; then goes away I kill it.
---
My bad. Assumed you were referring to my post not my reply.
---
Ninja_ing was never a reportable offense in vanilla wow
---
Lok’Tar
---
Yes those things were changed BECAUSE they were bugs. Locks infernals were never changed in vanilla wow because it wasn't a bug it was how the ability was supposed to function...

Subtlety
---
It's a dumb way of saying AoE.
---
If you had been &lt; Select Shitload &gt; you would have outnumbered them.

This is missing a [Tarnished Sillver Necklace](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9333) (ZF Graves) though...
---
Frickin Quel’Dorei magic.
---
If only reforged came out first. So sad how the timing turned out.
---
You're right, they are probably ahead of priests since a feral druid doesn't use mana, it can all go towards heals and they have a tank form for even more survivability.
---
Most rogues I've grouped with won't unlock for party and just take the locked chest for them selves.
---
Was this Fairbanks last night??
---
Find margin in cloth item disenchant value.
---
Get auctioneers enchantrix.  It can scan enchanting mats and compare to common crafted cloth greens.
---
Sometimes 50s in cloth can be craft and disenchanted into 75s.  You essentially become a mill turning cloth into enchanting mats.
---
There is a reason enchanting and tailoring work so well together.
---
HOLY FUCK I REMEMBER THAT! That was amazing
---
This specific interaction and a million others just like it are what form our experiences of and crafting of the community. Now you and other party members will spread the word of this rogue's behavior, and they will tell their side of it. And the two of you might ignore each other. And so it goes as your community experience is carved out
---
the issue with STV isn't the pvp really, its the sheer population density and not enough mob spawns to handle it
---
Even then if it happens on every boss and you stick around it's more your fault than theirs.
---
In pve?I thought that was a pvp thing
---
Spicy little guy, aren’t you
---
We played on private servers for many years and made the decision to avoid the major private server player population centers. We ended up on noggenfogger.
---
On private servers you'd see 99% min/maxed races. Dwarf priests and paladins, human warriors and rogues, almost nothing but NE hunters... Not a day goes by on noggenfogger without seeing a wide variety of race/class combinations and people clearly being new to their classes.
---
Our little realm is a place where most players haven't played the game to death and have something else left to do besides min/maxing to see who can get top parse for each fight.
---
I love my noggers.
---
Yeesh, a 54 Warrior that sat there taking full duration fears like we don't have tools for that? He deserved that L.
---
So he just need to sell 1 item to get his epic Mount at 60
---
Yes. But it is FIVE PLAYERS not ONE. That is stupid to take them as equal. Sorry but I just do not agree with it. Have multiple accounts sure, but I disagree with multilogging, nevermind multilogging AND controlling them all at once for an edge in combat.
---
Loser you loser
---
Even if he did say thanks you wouldn't know it, it would come out as gibberish from the other faction haha. Unless he e moted
---
as a first time warrior and experiencing this, thank you!
---
I see so the rogue is leagues ahead of the druid stealth but the druid stealth is still viable in many situations.
---
People have sold summons to major cities for going on 2 decades now...
---
One addon
---
Is two accounts acceptable? Or any multiboxing frustrates you?
---
Had a warrior who was constantly getting threat for some reason under a seemingly competent tank, and it was pushing me to the absolute limit. Got a bit impatient and later in the dungeon asked what was up with their threat. 
---
"I'm casting taunt"
---
...
---
"Why?"
---
"Because it's fun"
---
Stopped healing him after that. And I mean completely, I didn't cast a heal on him the rest of the dungeon. And what do you know, he didn't taunt anymore and lived just fine.
---
Yea, it seems the current 1.12 patch nerfed the whole games difficulty by 30% if I remember correctly from ages ago. That’s why there’s no epic moments in parties anymore. We’re literally playing a nerfed vanilla. I remember doing BWL at the time when 1.12 hit on live. People were saying how easy things were. That’s what we have now :(
---
Oh fuck you. Heaven forbid 2 min out of your shitty day is wasted.
---
I was in a group with a mage and asked for water. They made me so many stacks of water. He said i didn't have to tip (after offering one). I gave him a measly 5 silver but man he was happy.
---
Going to this amount of effort, I imagined they considered all of the possible factors to finding the perfect server.
---
i've been tracking humanoids on my druid as well. seems to help a bit
---
I’m 100% with you! It’s never ending!
---
What add-on is that to show where the item is? Does it work across the account? I used to have an addon that showed how many I had and where they all were, like 10 linen on character 1 in bank, 5 linen on character 2... Etc.
---
Horde have an edge in pvp, that doesn't make them easy mode lol. And assuming that's the main motivator for most people rolling horde is just unreasonable
---
people downvoting the truth
---
Yup shitty lag mechanic still there.
---
😂
---
my heart skipped a beat just looking at this. I can't wait to have them.
---
Thank you! That makes me more excited to get him
---
Honestly it looks like medium / heavy leather is selling really well on the AH and zones with skinnable monsters are littered with corpses because the respawn rates are through the roof. Just skin everything and sell?
---
I rolled a Warlock to do this again. Come on, Blizzard. No changes.
---
Is what it is.
---
Okay there mr king of world of warcraft
---
By defending bull shit?
---
Just because the guy posted it doesn't mean people are just discovering it. He was just tryna get some free karma.
---
Honestly its been a struggle my guy. I might roll a horde on westfall just to chat with you more about it. do you have discord? I'm new to it so I dont know how to find my id lol
---
Ok, but why is this on the classic sub? 
---
Like good work on plugging them but honestly you're just gonna get down voted into the nether here

In scholo and strat yeah, but outside of that the only mob that drops them in WPL/EPL is skeletal warlords I think. We killed 100s of the mid 50s mobs in EPL/WPL in the beta trying to get death rays. The only confirmed drops all were off skeletal warlords.
---
Yes it's direct transfer. You don't get to pick though. At character select screen click shop
---
Thanks only goes.to Netherwind

uh huh
---
Warcraftmovies?
---
The "normal" way to play is to bumble around inefficiently, duh
---
A 1000 player server can feel just as full as a 10000 player server if you take the time to get to know the people. Your experience is what you make it. And it's up to you if you invest energy in worrying about things you could potentially miss out on in the future based on where you are playing now.
---
At least humans can run the longest distance out of all the animals. So hope you got a head start and are not in poor physical condition.
---
i mean if a preist and a druid are standing beside a character, casting spells on it and his health is slowly ticking up
---
that's how warcraft pley
---
I never really saw the point of Dash. My pet can only run as fast as me anyway, and I can't see it really turning the tide of battle.
---
It takes some time to go get used to, but once you start farming humanoids around lvl 30+ the gold feels sooo good
---
I know, I was just trying to start a fun dialogue. There's no such thing as "fair" in wpvp.
---
Clique.
---
im sorry, you cant use it anymore
---
Kirtonos?
---
That’s way too high for these guys. These are the trolls up northwest. Get a couple people in your party to help with the groups of mobs and you’re gold.
---
Most often that is because they have pulled aggro and that 5% is soon 50%.
---
PSA to warriors and Bear tanks, you add "/cancelaura Power Word: Shield"  to any of your macros to clear sheield incase anyone ever does shield you.
---
That being said, as a priest, I'm only going to shield you so I have time to cast my 3s heal.
---
Boo hoo
---
Weren't you calling me the soft skinned one?  Yet you keep replying to me.  Please, keep crying
---
I just hate walking there, gotta go to the ruins... Then the castle, then the elevator, then circle twice because I missed the inn keeper the first time.
---
YES! I am so glad so many people are happy with it versus hating the quests. It really makes you feel closer to your shaman. That's why im leveling 2. Why pay for respec costs when you can have resto and enh.
---
But Wildstar was amazing. RIP.
---
PSA to healers we locks can heal ourselves, you do not need to heal us to full before every fight, you do not need to heal us above half hp unless it's a boss fight. We appreciate the constant top offs but they are unnecessary and you are slowing the group down trying to keep us topped off.
---
-Love your friendly neighborhood warlock.
---
Getting it to be able to do transmutes and cloth cooldowns pretty meta.
---
DEATH TO ME.
---
Can skin worsens. Doesn’t make sense
---
Not irony, you just used the wrong word.
---
Maybe have unique flightpaths? Like you walk/mount over to a special flight master and they'll send you up?
---
Is cooking useful for a 2h dps warrior? Can I make money off cooking? I have my fishing up to 75 Max level and I have just been selling fish but figured I may make some more money if I cook the shit first and get some good exp

---
Imagine shitting on people for not following a quest guide.
---
Either that, or all fights are fair.
---
If an item is your best in slot for the next 10 levels it's perfectly reasonable to need on it. The itemization is off but such is classic wow.
---
My buddy, who is playing WoW for the first time with Classic, encountered Haggle doing this and didn’t realize what was happening at first. At first he thought the name was for the benches themselves, and was then was confused when he couldn’t click on them like an NPC. It was only after I told him to look under the benches that he realized what was going on. This super minor detail really threw him for a loop. Another great example of the wonderful immersion in Classic.
---
Outplayed
---
How do you know that isn’t the necronomicon
---
Just want to say thanks to all of the mages out there handing out free water/food.  you da real heroes
---
I was a hard core raider back in those days, 6 nights a week. Life has moved on so I will be lucky to raid 1 night now. I just have to accept that I wont see BWL, AQ or Naxx and be grateful I saw them back then. I'm sure I'll still have fun with MC / Ony and the social side of the game and I wont have to sacrifice much time. 
---
I don't actually miss the raiding in any case, loving the social side of the game now that there is no LFG and I realise that's why I hated retail so much, it felt like a SP game.
---
Yeah. You can do it st 35. But getting the mats its dificult bellow 45
---
Then don't heal them, a few pulls at 5% hp and they will learn
---
cya is 3 hrs
---
Player skeletons used to stick around for much longer in Vanilla than they do now in Classic. Blizzard announced that they weren't going to keep that, but I'm not sure of the actual reasoning.
---
A good rogue will beat an evenly matched warrior any day of the week (pre 60). I love ganking warriors and making them pop retaliation, only for me to blind them and exit combat for a restealth then cheapshot once it's over.
---
As a Rogue who has spent the time to level lockpicking I don't agree, it's scummy as hell. It's on the same level as Mages charging their healer for water in a dungeon.
---
", he said in a subreddit bursting with myriad players' praise for the return of a sense of community as they share stories about overcoming shared hardships.
---
No 1 guild is alliance though so horde can suck it
---
Oh, look, a brag post disguised as something else. 
---
Grats, I guess. Come work my 60hr/wk job for me. It's my turn.
---
do you know nothing of honor!?
---
You can still buy a regular mount like the rest of the plebs as a warlock.
---
What’s the name of that interface UI addon
---
I've been rezzing every friendly corpse o see on my priest and forting/healing them when they pop back up. These corpse runs are kinda long so figure I'd do some public service.
---
indeed, he posted a link to wowhead which i checked (my whole post was removed though as i forgot to assign a flair:)
---
anyway, I understand now the whole mechanics. thanks a lot!
---
Unless it is lasting all 30 seconds on all 3 targets you are losing out on that deal fyi. It's fine for damage but it's incredibly Mana ineffecient
---
Man these posts are great! People spending time to get the pets they really want. There is so much about Classic that makes you actually care about your character.
---
I thought this was about me at first since I was level 30 in Arathi earlier today. but I never KoS especially on low a health player, so I'm good.
---
Yikes, classic and the classic experience and my classic experience and it looks like many people's classic experience are wonderful things. You're the one who chose to take this discussion in the direction of lfg and lfm. I guess don't take it in that direction if it's going to bother you? Haha.
---
Solid advice. Take my upvote
---
I was running around 1k needles and a ?? rogue started following me, followed me for 2 minutes, then turned around and one shot the warlock I was questing with
---
Dangerous to mention this game here but old school Runescape did a good job of exactly this.
---
You're always just a random adventurer, you're always referred to as one of many "adventurers". No one ever puts you on a pedestal in Runescape, not until you enter a chain quest like Roving Elves where you have to do like 6 quests for this one NPC in Ardougne and then he starts greeting you with praise because you've actually done something for him to earn his respect.
---
IIRC Dwarves and various other races straight up hate you even when you get a quest off of them. Another reason why I believe Runescape's quests are fundamentally better than WoW's.
---
in many ways troll is better than undead, the racial difference is Shadowguard vs devouring plague.
---
Devouring plague = extremely expensive in mana, it does damage and heals, but is so expensive you sometimes have to find tricks and work arounds just to be bale to afford to use the spell
---
Shadowguard = Cheap mana, 3 charge damage shield that is pretty solid. The main benefit is that it procs blackout, which is your stun. Melee will charge at you and sometimes immediately procs into your stun, can also work on casters, has saved my life many times.
---
The other toss up is Berserking vs WoF. WoF is good for breaking out of fear but berserking can boost your damage by up to 30% at low health, so its a close one.
---
Either race is fine for shadow pvp, personally i prefer troll however most will tell you to go undead, you won't be at a disadvantage either way.

---
Man, you’re lucky. I assume Faerlina since that’s where the biggest streamers are?  
---
While I’ve been able to quest there without much trouble, I have been ganked several times along the way, especially when competing for mobs.   Overall the spawn rates are good enough it’s a no issue but sometimes it takes forever.  Tonight while the servers were crapping on themselves, Sodapoppin ganked me and half the alliance in STV before he moved onto Duskwood.
---
That would be amazing if it was 😂
---
60% of the pre-raid warrior BiS both dps and tank comes from BRD.
---
I’m 43 now but at 50-52 I’m going to live in that place and never return to a quest hub.
---
Fuck, people said it was hard.  Not necessarily hard, just extreme lack of utility.  And yes, 2 mobs is basically death.
---
But hey, once every 30 minutes I can 3 pull with retaliation.
---
correcting someones spelling while spelling a word incorrectly is ironic.
---
Best one yet
---
At what level is it reasonable for me to do BFD. Not gonna lie, I'm not great yet. I just started playing w/ classic.
---
See this is one of those things that are great about playing in 2019. When this happened back in the day 99.9% of people wouldn’t have any way to record it. 
---
Thanks for sharing. Now back to leveling.
---
I'm hindering justice? I havent done shit. 1. I specifically asked for a PM so the info wouldn't be posted straight to the comment section to prevent brigading. 2. I asked for an article summarizing who it is and how they found him. 3. Besides wanting to be kept up to date on if this gets arrested, I like reading stories about how 4chan does some of the things it does(like finding out who a random ddosser is) 4. I wouldn't do anything with any info given besides observe.
---
You are essentially correct that you are nearly unkillable if you have time to prepare for an encounter by virtue of having the Echo.  The Echo is the in-game explanation for how your character survives repeatedly dying in raid encounters, and why you can see AOE markers on the ground - you see the future with the Echo, and all those wipes are potential futures that you avoid, until you eventually get it right.
---
If you don't or can't take the time to prepare and look into the immediate future for an encounter (such as when you encounter a certain main antagonist in the early Stormblood quests) then you absolutely can get your ass kicked, though you still have the advantage of seeing AoE markers and stuff that normal people can't.
---
You are also "The" Warrior of Light, but there are many other Echo-blessed Adventurers (with a capital A) out there who the WoL canonically calls upon to do all the trials, dungeons and raids, because they're too much for the WoL alone.  The Scions also, though they don't all have the Echo.

Had a horde spriest do this to me it was great we were helping each other out then he did that iwas like omg horde are the best then he left and a lvl?? Rogues killed me right after not all enemy factions are evil just the ?? Ones lol
---
Its your most efficient skill to level with until you get WW and MS.
---
They have way too many/too large bags for starting zone
---
Maybe I'll try leveling at least one character per phase. I've got my Mage to 33, my shaman to 7. Where to go next?
---
Stormwind seems to get more traffic IMO. How tf did you grind 1k gold already?
---
I had a healer refusing to heal my lock buddy when lifetapping in fights to keep dps up. The healer was constantly above 80% mana and told my buddy to deal with it. 
---
Then miraculously after I (the tank) said something about it my buddy got heals. our healer did have a comment about imbursement due to having to drink more water. So we traded him some silver and all was good ^^
---
32 Shaman looking for guild @ Kromcrush.
---
I’m still leveling as enhancement but I’ll be more of a Resto guy later on (or Enhance if I can).

Looking for a guild that is still growing and does dungeons a lot to prepare for future raids.
---
Not much of a PvPer but I’m open minded and willing to learn.
---
I dont know why I bother. This sub is shit. Peace clown

At least you will be wiping your tears for missing certain quest loot with that sweet sweet gold
---
Sounds like a bug but god damn does that guy have to be that salty?
---
Hilsbrad and stv are good for your level. Can confirm - am lvl 34 warrior. Can likely move into arathi as well after a couple of lvls through those zones.
---
SPREAD THE PLAGUE!
---
There's no faction change. You couldn't have your night elf druid join the horde. 
---
A character migration is exactly what it says. It moves a character, and nothing else.
---
I bought a second monitor specifically for wow, need my google screen on hand. I can’t mod worth shit, but I sure know how to spend a dollar to fix my problems. :D
---
I've managed to get 6-7hours sleep each night, but at the cost of instant meals and a growing mess from all the neglected chores.
---
I think...I think I might have to clean instead of playing wow tonight.
---
As a druid, I will keep this in mind
---
Atlas Loot
---
I just wanna play this game so bad but cannot find time I’m only lvl 17 😭
---
well to fully explain we are going to have to go back in time a bit. It all started.....
---
Amazing story thanks for sharing. FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
Theres no mechanic that makes axes slower, thats true.  But theres no mechanic that makes cloth have more Int either. Yet, relative to other armor types, it does.  If you prefer slow weapons, at most levels you will tend to find axes.
---
Lol true that
---
Some call it.. the pre-emptive crybaby technique
---
Lolololol
---
Servers that hit the "Full" threshold become unavailable for transfer. Medium or High can be transferred to.

Prostateexam could literally save your life if you catch cancer quickly. Banning that name would be like banning the name "vaccination". More prostateexam!
---
Okay cool thank you
---
who cares about a fear trinket when you can proc multiple 3 second stuns from the trolls racial shadow guard, fear is only really a problem with warlocks whereas stuns hurt everybody
---
Hmm if you put those words in any other order it really changes the meaning
---
Hardiness, WotF and even Warstomp is absolutely playing PvP on easy. 
---
The guy asked why there's so many Horde PvPers, there you go, because it's so much easier. You're comparatively much stronger.
---
Playing a Warlock, Hunter or Elem Shaman against a Warrior and Hardiness procs against his intercept? Congrats, you just won.
---
Playing an UD Rogue against a Priest or Pre-DC  Warlock? Congrats, you just won.
---
Etcetc
---
Am I missing the point? Here’s the scenario:
---
You’re standing at a popular flight path. Fresh targets are landing every minute or so, let’s say. Outnumbered, they die with ease. Meanwhile, that last guy you killed just tried to respawn! He’s at half health and mana. You kill him too. Shortly thereafter, another fresh player lands. As nauseum. 
---
Of course I’m not suggesting that you ignore fresh targets and instead camp the same player exclusively. That’s ridiculous.
---
There’s just something off with the Retail mugshots
---
stronger if you can actually afford to cast it
---
Nobody gave me attention in ironforge so let me try and get attention reddit. 
---
That’s pretty much what this post says.
---
Caves, brother. Simple quest caves
---
No, there's nobody there. Just you (:
---
My damage wasn't low.  I was 2nd.  I have no idea why you would assume there was another reason when I'm telling you what happened, but cheers.
---
Haha, my SO is new to wow and she rolled mage as well. She literally loves making water and randomly giving them to randoms in Storm Wind and the like. She likes seeing how people react. It's always funny seeing people in chat be like "Hey! Who gave me that water??" and she just runs off to the next one lol
---
You're a lucky one. I was hard stopped at 30 for a bit on my Mage because the ganks were endless in Arathi, Hillsbrad, and STV. Desolace as an Alliance ain't bad though. :)
---
Damn that is shitty. The number should have no effect whatsoever on the decision
---
Some people hate warlocks, lol, get that aggression out now while it's possible &gt;:3
---
Is this why people pay double for the coloured bags??
---
Sleep 17/300
---
Because ESDF makes more ergonomical sense than WASD?
---
Nah regardless quests
---
Good to know:)
---
Not sure what he's trying to pull here by claiming "even ground" here honestly. It's not even at all. If multiboxers had to control all 5 characters through 5 different keyboards that would be fair. But the fact that they can client-side rig this so one command gives 5 commands...I think that's against something.
---
Okay, did this copypasta come from “Those Two?”
---
I don't run Linux but I have a Linux based firewall for my home network--same issues and same fix!
---
This is completely wrong and a terrible comparison. Yes, cloth tends to have int. No, axes aren't generally more slow than other weapons. Maces are generally more slow than the rest, but still not enough to actually matter.
---
There's no correlation at all.
---
someone inform this guy that this subreddit is 90% private server zoomers that never in their life actually played vanilla
---
But seriously, is anyone here actually convinced that the vocal majority of aggressively autistic "CLASSIC IS MINE NOW YOURS REEEEEEEE" people are vanilla players in their 30s and not private server zoomers in their late teens/early 20s?
---
For the Horde.
---
Well, shit. He wasn’t even born yet!
---
Gold was too valuable to consider purposely losing durability. I had to save my gold for when I accidentally lost durability.
---
I'm always happy when people like you show up so I can slowly curate my reddit experience.
---
I dont remember this tele... is it useable by horde and where is it?
---
Ilvl doesnt even matter in high M+s. Raider.io score does. Ilvl is pointless to show
---
I have seen hundreds of posts like this and they still make me laugh.
---
Turns out that isn't a normal thing in most parts of the world lol
---
same
---
Exactly what I am thinking, the future.
---
We’ll miss you, fellow clown
---
Wanna see me do it again
---
Maybe it's because I've probably spent more time playing level 20 starter edition toons over the years than actually playing at max level (linked starter account ftw,) but I don't see the confusion in WC. It's a figure eight. I can run that place in my sleep or completely drunk off my ass.
---
Ya know, I actually thought south park might do this as a part 2 to one of their most famous episodes. Its topical again, so it seems appropriate.
---
They could blow it all up into how modern retail is deliberately junk due to some masterplan of some psycho (perhaps the original mega nerd - mad about his original defeat).
---
I knew you'd post this.
---
*Because I'm psychic.*
---
Snek bout to eat your corpse. RIP.
---
Drakedog would approve.
---
It's a different circumstance, but I pay back the karma by dotting mobs for people and performing rescue fears. Saved a shaman 3 levels above me in STV last night when he pulled too many trolls. Killed a straggler, geared another, and bought him enough time to heal.
---
Yes, I thought it was my mouse. Logitech  too
---
I sometimes only use mouse in pve. It's just easier since I'm constantly switching to Youtube or whatever I'm doing on my second screen

Should probably delete Classic while they are at it. Too many opportunities for people to get griefed.
---
No, we were doing small/normal pulls.  It wasn't an inconvenience to the group at all, it was just an insufferable asshole who thought I was spec'd "wrong".  He said as much.
---
What do you mean ? No one that learnt English abroad would use "would of" as the mistake comes from the english pronunciation.

This

Typically, in your case it was just a mistake.

How is he pulling off that dps?
---
RIP. I remember ganking someone on the chicken escort quest in feralas at the end of it. Idk if you know but it’s about 10-15 min escort. Poor guys.
---
Don't give the multiboxers any middle ground. The root problem is that they can use 1 command to give 5 commands...to different characters. Not sure why that wasn't banned 15 years ago.
---
Yea, I think I agree. The only time I'd agree with this is if it was individual inputs.
---
Its not.  All that info is from pServers which had jacked rep gain rates.
---
Lol what about mooncloth bags
---
I throw extra food at my pet sometimes, just in case, I don’t want him going yellow in the middle of a fight and losing that damage.
---
Plus as a smart hunter, I picked up fishing. Only takes a few minutes to gather up one or two stacks of fish, so I always have plenty at hand.

It wasn’t a bug.

I've been looking for the same thing and can't find one :( it's really nice to know how much your heals are hitting for. I'd suggest the miks scrolling thing everyone else mentioned. You can reposition where the text scrolls and choose which kinds of things will scroll. You can eliminate all the damage and heal over time spells too. It's the best replacement I could find
---
It never left. It's particularly noticable with the darkmoon inky black potion and the lightforged glowing potion (yes the effects stack)
---
for the love of god hit the print screen button
---
I actually enjoy the shit out of fishing. I got it to 300 before hitting 40 and used it to fund my mount. I just wish there was a little more to it, like being able to fish up treasure maps or rare mobs.
---
Obviously fastest 60. But 35 prolly do fine too.
---
Cant imagine what theyre doing. Better just keep dying bro =D
---
Those savages cant build a city either, Ogremarr layout is garbage. Undercity is the gold standard.
---
Then the meganerd starts brainwashing butters *in game* and makes him start sabotaging classic by orchestrating a huge ddos attack.

Oh ya.. it's all coming together.

Cleave was used in WoW back in TBC to describe arena comps. Now everyone just calls their comp _____ cleave because it's a meme.

Good riddance
---
As a mage who sheeps hunters and kills their pets, how many times do I have to kill your pet before he runs away?
---
Best used for emergencies, but I'd rather my Priest not waste the mana to start with.
---
Still a good macro to know.
---
Wild, same thing was happening on Grobbulous.

Yeah, there were some asshole skulls that body camped me for 3 hours while I was there during the first week of release trying to get my pally weapon😫

I often wonder, do people actually do this or are we just joking?

no i play a druid
---
Save it and sell it later. It will be worth more by time you are trying to get your mount. Or if you really want to save it then keep it till phase 3 when people start to twink.
---
Not only did I get kicked but my internet went down??
---
Twinks in your area would like to bang out some ganks from behind

Can’t remember but if it’s not ironforge, could be tanaris, because goblin is in ratchet if I remember right.

I mained a healer back when I began playing in 2006. I'm finding now that the best groups are the ones where people actually communicate. The most successful dungeon runs were led by a communicative, and patient tank.

I've been noticing that people don't really want to talk or communicate when they are in a party or doing a dungeon. It could just be my server, but it's been a trend that's sort of putting me off the game. Maybe I'm just older now, but it's not the same.
---
😀
---
But we have normalized wep speeds so speed isn’t even relevant really.
---
Do I win a prize?!
---
&gt; I grouped and socialized more today than I have in months on retail, an it was a blast.
---
&gt; Do you think Blizzard could ever restore this in Retail WoW? That is, ***without taking out game systems such as LFG/LFR, etc.***
---
"My last house burned down.  Do you think there's a way I could prevent that from happening in my new house?  That is, without removing all the lit candles, piles of straw, and open containers of gasoline I like having around."
---
There's no socialization in Retail because there's no downside to not socializing in Retail.
---
Wait.  Let me say that again in case you skipped over it.  There's no socialization in Retail because there's no downside to not socializing in Retail.
---
The only way to promote socializing in a game is to create positive incentives for social interactions with people (while making it difficult to replace them), and creating negative incentives for failing to have social interactions with people.  But hey, I've got a little time, so lets dig into a few things.
---
1.  You know how annoying it is that someone else keeps tagging mobs before you do (especially the named quest mob) and you don't get credit?  Looks like you're gonna have to send them a message and ask to group.  That gets most of the quests done faster than doing it solo and you can check your quest log to see if you're both on any other quests.
---
They sure did fix THAT in Retail!  With the "fix", you can just run around hitting stuff once to get credit.  Any other players who are doing the quest are effectively just nameless NPCs that make your job slightly easier.  How convenient!
---
2.  Leveling in Retail is super easy.  You can solo everything.  Every class can heal themselves (or at least have no downtime because of regen).  Convenient AF.  Guess you don't need to give/receive class buffs then, since nothing is going to kill you regardless.  Imagine though, that you found yourself in a tough spot... but someone from your faction is nearby!  Luckily, they're paying enough attention to even help you out!  But they're from another realm and you're only seeing them now because your server population is low, so you'll almost certainly never see them again, ever.  And because of that, there's also less motivation to help in the first place.
---
Compare that to Classic, where every level is a struggle.  But it's a shared struggle.  I'm gonna give my Paladin buff to every poor SoB I run past because they're gonna need it.  I'm gonna heal that injured warrior while he's fighting a mob and usually jump in to help if someone's getting overwhelmed.  And some day, that warrior might see me post "Healer LFG" and show up with a memory of the time he didn't die because of my heals.
---
3.  "That is, without taking out game systems such as LFG/LFR, etc."  The more I think about this the more frustrated I get.  I love dungeons.  Healing is my favorite part of WoW, and to me questing/grinding is just a way to get me into the next dungeon/raid.  "But Sattorin!", I hear you say, "You MUST love the instant teleport-to-dungeon cross-realm group finder!".  And in Retail, I ~~do~~ did use it all the time.  Like, I have skipped entire expansions worth of questing content while leveling by chain running group finder dungeons.
---
But you have to realize.  You have to.  I know you do.  That this system kills any possible social interaction, both in the world and within those dungeon groups.  I have never met another player through Retail LFG.  I have encountered good tanks and bad tanks, good DPS and bad DPS, but as far as my experience went they weren't actually players.  They were effectively NPCs that were (almost) instantly created by the game to fill out the group roles that players would traditionally fill.  Each group of "players" was completely disposable and replaceable.  If one was defective, they could be replaced.  It might take longer to replace a tank role than the others, but the dungeons were easy enough that we could do it with myself and 3 DPS anyway.
---
4.  LFR  -  Take everything I said about number 3, but worse.  Not only are the "players" instantly gained and replaceable, *you* don't even need to participate to succeed.  As long as the others are doing their jobs and the bosses die, you could skate through the entire raid without doing anything at all.
---
It's so exciting to think about the end boss of a game, isn't it?  Where's the story heading?  How strong will he/she be?  How many hours will I have to struggle in preparation for this final, epic battle?
---
All of that dies with LFR.  If you can get/see/experience something without effort, it becomes meaningless.  For me (and I suspect many others) knowing that I could experience the climactic ending of the storyline with literally zero effort kills any desire to improve myself or my character.  There's no special reward for putting in extra effort except for the same gear with slightly different numbers on it, which will be replaced in the next several months when new content arrives.  What a complete and total disappointment.
---
5.  I could go on, but I'm out of time.  I'm sure others will cover much, much, more about Retail that trades social interaction for solo convenience, but that's it from me.
---

It physically pained me that you messed up the jump from the stairs, because I've done that before when trying to catch a close Zep and I know that pain

There are already several ninjas known in netherwind and people have blacklisted them. So you have a mount, but now you can't do instances? They've played themselves.
---
The dude has tens of thousands of tweets and a 24hour news cycle with enough time to focus on every typo
---
It's likely not a bug. Blizzard removed many mechanics to prevent griefing. Mages can't poly someone else's tagged mob anymore for example.
---
Hahaha love it
---
Lmaooo
---
tab
---
You get the thistle tea recipe from that chain
---
Yikes! I've been quite lucky and haven't been camped alot! Usually when I encounter a horde player who's killing me I ask for back up in the general and defense channels! If they want war then let's give it to em!
---
You can, but there's a cap. One piece of best-quality food will get them from just into the yellow up to the max. You can look at your combat log while feeding them to see the happiness gain.
---
Instead of everyone clapping he clapped for everyone? r/thathappened
---
This isn't how any of this works
---
Not being able to polymorph tagged mobs
---
Not at all. Both the guild invites and the way he posted is bullshit. I don't defend either.
---
That is a great idea, thank you! And what happens in phase 3? I have read about twinks and such, but is there a pvp update in phase 3?
---
We won the fight btw
---
Kazzak has a hard leash but they confirmed some other bosses would not.
---
It’s no longer a battlefield. It’s a bloody massacre
---
I didn’t know this. A troll fucked an elf and viola, night elves?
---
Did they “fix” the moonwalking bug for classic? I’m lvl 49 almost and haven’t yet moonwalked :(
---
Definitely charge for a port imo. Water is up to you, giving water out helps reduce downtime which benefits you with faster dungeons.
---
Phase 3 is when battlegrounds come out.
---
Pets will not run away just from being killed. They would need to stay unhappy long enough to drop through the loyalty levels. 
---
Also, you're an asshole.
---
Yes but not every cast takes full 30 seconds to bite.  Sometimes you get bites in the first 2-6 seconds, sometimes at the 10-15 mark. 
---
But yes, sometimes the bite does happen at around 20-30.
---
Classic

I think the point is that the Undead looks like the dude from the [Big Brain Time Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yeah-this-is-big-brain-time).
---
BTW, part of the point of posting these memes is to divide people into the "in group" who understand them from the rest of us who aren't cool enough to follow along. So every time you post a "Huh?" response instead of googling you are encouraging more of this sort of thing. Just so you know.
---
You don't need to convince me that horde have an edge in pvp, that much is clear. What isn't clear is what proportion of players choose horde based on their racials. Get it?

I really don't understand classic FPs... https://imgur.com/YyEeVcP

Go back to retail if this bothers you
---
how much gold for your premium snapchat sub?
---
You needed the momentum
---
Yeah, after people finish a quest if there are respawns at the entrance and don’t feel like fighting their way out they usually just haul @ss, hoping they don’t get dazed and killed.  If you don’t, you’re home free and don’t have to clear all that trash that you no longer need for a quest... because you finished the quest.
---
For real I'm not the biggest fan of bfa, but the cinematics have been amazing. Even the ones rendered in game. Varian's death is one of the best cinematics they've ever made to me.
---
Probably death skipping.
---
Since there is no real penality to use the gardian angel to rez at low level, it is sometime faster to just die at the end of your quest and rez at cim near the quest hub than walking all the way back
---
Idk if it’s THE highest but it’s very high populated

It's TRUE

This is magical. Thank you.

I loved it so much! So glad I rolled on a pvp server! I kinda wish more stuff happened tho, Grobbulus looks so fun!

okay but if you're collecting beaks as proof that you've killed the animal and the beak is damaged why can't i cut off the heads instead, that's proof as well
---
Soulstone and summons are both things that benefit the whole group including the warlock. Reducing wait time or preventing a potential wipe saves everyone time including you. Do what you want but it's not a good argument in my opinion.
---
So why arent thet doing it to Firemaw EU aswell.

Would've

Brilliant, amazing.

---
one time I let my friend play on my warrior back in 2005ish he started talking shit to a low level undead mage in the undead starting area. The mage sat there didn't really say much but suddenly gave him an intellect buff and said "lol you need it" then ran off. 14 years later and I still remember that sick burn
---
I hope this is a bug or an oversight. I want stuff like this back.
---
Also as a small note, helmets like Raging Berserkers helm (the one Herod drops) used to be closed on troll males. Classic is currently using the retail version where it looks like a big dumb bucket on your head. I was severely disappointed when I found out.
---
Farm for what? The deviate skins for the LW patterns to craft twink gear?
---
Cast a Molten Armor buff for that Molten Core burn.
---
depends on server i guess iv literally had 0 problem finding a group. not to mention 99 times out of 100 i get a spot as a shadow dps, choosing between heals and dps you should never have a problem finding a group and in fact, have you considered just starting your own group? 3dps is easy to find its just a matter of waiting 5 mins to find a tank
---
Oh shit. I don’t remember my imp’s name from Vanilla.
---
...to abuse layering and have the streamer guild panic over nothing

This is a mistake a native would make though. Because it doesn't make any sense if you haven't heard it a lot by people who don't speak clearly.

R U buffing divine spirit as well?

No it is a passive talent which I shouldn't, also can't cast

just use tradechat or zone chat and stop being a retail noob, youre ruining my clasique experience

---
Simple yet effective response.
---
I know a mage in our guild, who does stack water while he is looking for tank/healer. Last night he gave 2 stacks for me, while we were looking for tank into BFD.
---
You just don’t go to Ravenholdt. Simple as that.
---
Just think, when you hit 60 you’ll get a ton of raid gear because everyone else in the raid will already have it

Sadly I do not have discipline specced yet

I actually do lol

Hard to explain, in the end it's just a little more control I guess?  I can turn and strafe, instead of having to turn for everything.  Also lets me run at a diagonal forward but keep the camera forward.  It's just a little more control on my path to lazyness.

I saw a gnome warlock with the same VW name on Grobbulus today. Reminded me of this post.

Holy shit props on being able to pull that much per week with a family! I’m lucky to get in 5 hours a week.

Running backwards to get more speed so you hit harder
---
Is Kromkrush a US server? If not I'll hop in and make an alt there.
---
Yeah shadowguard definitely procs it. There is no other way I could've gotten 4 stacks with 40% chance to get one when wanding down a mob.
---
Because people like to argue with each other? You’re just going to get the same arguments here as you see in westfall chat.. what do you expect from this post.
---
Yea if you are an asshole.
---
They are done with the quest and blitzing their way out. Not really a mystery.
---
I wasn't actively leveling up the entire time.  I would do stuff in Ironforge, do stuff with gathering and crafting, etc.  I also ran a lot of dungeons and that's generally a lot less efficient.

bad troll is bad

I've noticed my minions pathing weird and pulling all the aggro...

The bad DPS, complainers, and people who don't listen get put on my ignore list. Means I'll never group with them again. I get to choose who I play with as a tank,.

I've read somewhere that "would of" is more likely to be a native spelling error. Can't remember where I saw it though.

Cringe cover up is cringe
---
Only loosers Call dm to vc.
---
Reading those when I was a midget made me salty, and comparing that to shade from players, the NPCs hurt me more.
---
Humble brag?
---
Because at that pace you’re between 4-5 hours per level, at the highest levels of the game, pacing you at the top .1% of players. Who are you needing to keep up with?
---
Considering the human racial is +spirit, I'd say humans give spirit.
---
Night elves can give improved corpse running speed.
---
I favor DM, because it’s Dead Mines. I guess people call it VC because of Van Cleef? Seems weird to me.
---
Except you'll have to worry about power cuts, political instability and bad internet.
---
its a bit complicated as you need the original classic sound directory, but im considering making a guide on it soon because i havent seen a good one out there.
---
Fishing in general is quite worth it even without being a hunter. Relaxing too imo
---
YaHT got updated with the tick rate fix but the addon you suggested also gives you time to react to it. Thanks I will start using this one.
---
About the lag tolerance (spell queue window). Correct me if I'm wrong but I think you are spreading misinformation about it.   
---
Default lag tolerance of 400ms means that your command registers on the server after a delay equal to your ping and then the server itself "spams" your command for total of 400ms untill it goes off once or it receives another command from you before the cooldown or gcd was ready for the first command. This helps you chain two or more abilities together with absolutely 0 delay between them even if your ping spikes hence the word lag tolerance. If you set it to 0 ( you shouldn't ) you cannot chain abilities together without delay between them unless you are literally robot spamming buttons with 0ms intervals with 0 ping.
---
That's lame.. mind control is cool, but let's fuck over enslave demon.
---
i killed a guy in STV and he said "You are evil" like that, made my day.
---
Sorrows looks a little low, but Dustshallow is a good idea
---
Yeah the flying takes away from world PvP, it's probably the main reason why world PvP is basically dead. It kinda came back with warmode, ut now that people can fly again I wouldn't be surprised if it died down once more.
---
I expect people to reply to the end statement as to whether it's happening on their server or not.
---
That or leave a snarky ass comment. Either or.
---
Thanks though for the comment!
---
Both of your comments are true
---
&gt;The classes weren’t that blended together.
---
They were though. There were no utility specs, no AOE specialists, no CC specialists, no burst specialists. Everyone was just damage. BC shows you can have every spec be desirable without having them be a homogenized mess, give BC decent rotations and you have basically the perfect class design.
---
Yeah bro, there should be a nice strong Chad on there ready to lift you up and carry you to new levels.
---
For anyone who finds one. It's a good rogue leveling dagger and that's it. I was finally able to sell mine for 20g. I probably could of got 30g if I wanted a few weeks.
---
Play your game
---
Right here.  Be the outrage you want to see in the world ^^^of ^^Warcraft
---
If griefing players on your own faction was part of the experience then I gotta say I'm glad they changed it.
---
 😭😭😭😭😭
---
There’s also a pet that drops in WC.
---
Better pop sprint so I can miss this jump faster
---
yeah hold on lemme just hearth back to town in the middle of a dungeon and check AH price
---
Gut Ripper though, it's fairly useless overall so it always went for cheap on private server auction houses. It doesn't work all that well as a twink weapon because it's level 40, and rogues typically don't use daggers while leveling, so really the only classes that would even want it are weird rogues or maybe Shamans for 1h+shield windfury or something.
---
Or on private servers, rogue facestab spec. That was pretty much the best use of it, since it's literally the highest damage dagger until level 60.
---
Yeah, fuck that. Any time a warrior DPS whispers me for a spot I tell them no. That gear is mine bud. You wanna go tank your own run.
---
My son took the transfer too and I'm worried that it's still Low Population.
---
But my thinking is that there are still far too many people on Herod so as they remove layers there still might be a lot more people who will switch as they see queue times going back up.
---
You can skin worgens....just saying
---
That troll took my short name. That’s real heresy if I say so myself.
---
Yeah so you just listed a bunce of horde controlled areas. Thousand needles is pretty bad cause horde bangin deep in there. Yesterday they werent letting any Alliance quest in there. Dungeons are your best bet for sure till 40. You can just respec tank and do SM runs for massive xp all day. Just watch a vid on how the dungeons progress and your good to go. GL my dude, my Horde friends can be ruthless but ive been ganked many times by Alliance on Epic mounts already. Blaumeux is brutal lol.
---
You would need to camp them for a very long time and they would need to keep re summoning their pet. They might not want to once they hit red or even yellow
---
Happiness is essentially a timer that either progresses or regresses depending on where they're at on the scale, but only when they are active.
---
Oh did Honestly roll alliance? What guild name are they under?
---
I'm leveling as my primary goal. I don't feel like fucking around stirring up shit for hours every time I walk across a zone. I did that on the last character I leveled to 60 back in vanilla because I didn't give a shit how fast I got there and at that point kills gave me honor.
---
I had the name Bigdickninja on my monk since monks became available. Still have it now even. On classic my Hunter was named that and didn't last 48 hours before getting reported.
---
I was under the impression that many of not close to all servers were getting disconnected from the DDoS. If that were true, I feel like that wouldn’t make people want to migrate necessarily.
---
There's a setting to increase your view range, though I'm not sure how much it affects rendering distance for objects vs just scenery maps. But yeah, in classic it was common to not see someone running at you until they're were passing you.
---
That's awesome because Sulfuras is the same. I rolled my Horde on Sulfuras and Alliance on Benediction. I really know how to pick
---
This isn’t a brag this is a simple question. If I was in the top .1% I’d be 60 by now. I’m sick of grinding and want to know if I can improve and by how much.
---
I like this
---
Fun read 📖 😜
---
I’m just making a twink right now I need 3 pieces from the dung. Just want to know what level player I need to target for assistance
---
Too funny
---
I don't see this as a humble brag at all.
---
He's not trying to keep up with anyone things are just more enjoyable for people at max level.
---
If the gay community and the wow community can agree on anything, its wanting to see twinks get fucked.
---
Fuckin' take it down a notch, Banshee Bitch. We came here to get away from that shit.
---
I did use this on vanilla to great effect in pvp over the mid 40s, most 49 twinks don't expect a random 45/46 dwarf rogue to be much of a challenge, so was a nice addition to the kit
---
Also add-ons, ask a guildie, etc
---
Honestly rolled horde. Not sure if they’ve downed rag yet. Primal was the first kill
---
I love Vdead Cmines!
---
&gt; I also have a list, its a rather small one though:
---
You mean a big one, You don't want that list getting small, Otherwise you'd be left with a big ol' pve server. :P
---
Embarrassing, you just got exposed in a web of lies. You aren't leveling 5 hours per level. EXPOSED. Mods ban this man. NOW!
---
Its quite easy.. DM is deadmines. If you Mean Dire maul, you often ad what wing East West or North. Why name an instance the name of the bosses, personally VC makes no sense for me.
---
It did not, i remember griefing with Summonin gportal soff cliffs and infernal doomguard in BC
---
I wenrt there and ended up just going thru to blasted lands. For alliance with no fp its pretty crap. Will go back later to do the skull and stopwatch quests.
---
What fish do you find is best to sell?
---
Unlikely. That's the cycle of ganking. You get ganked, so you gank.
---
Y'all need some help.
---
H20... almost right! 😛
---
Well, I guess you're right.  I was speaking from a raiding point of view as I just assumed that's what OP was asking, for whatever reason.
---
Its npcs like this that ruin the game for everyone
---
1. people know being dramatic draws attention
---
2. people know not being dramatic means they get ignored entirely
---
Is it not like you need high enough rep to buy some items in SW?
---
Then it should be interchangable.
---
It does threat depending on how many allies it buffs I think right? But 5 people is significant. Does it apply the threat every cast?
---
This - it works.  Sometimes.   You gotta spam the shit out of it.
---
Stacking doesn't work with the buff as well, right? Say the buff is active already and you feed them again. 
---
I remember in late bc or wrath (maybe incorrectly) that spam feeding my pet seemed to work faster
---
Yes, obviously you must learn to outplay the 5 ?? players coming after you, duh.
---
Lol no you can’t. Unless your servers econ is beyond fucked
---
I agree with the dungeons. Not on the group though. Horde is being ruthless on Blaumeux lol. Straight up controlling multiple zones so we can level easier. Callouts on any Alliance and I will just Polymorph spam anybody that messes with me and get help from zone chat. 
---
Alliance keeps having level 60s come through and gank lowbies so we just keep taking over zones. 20-40 is a powerhouse for Horde on that server atm.
---
Desolace is good spot with little People. And decent gold from hyenas etc. 
---
I just grinded rfd/sm and pick pocketed all the time wich gave me enough gold for mount in 40
---
Pretty easy to skip. Desolace is usually pretty empty and you can do a handful of arathi and hillsbrad quests to get into SM grinding range
---
5 Servers are feeding into Heartseeker. They must really want to fill that server up
---
How'd you make most of that cash my dude
---
Saw a clip from that video just now and he doesn't have have Stormstrike hotkeyed. He has auto attack on 1 and stormstrike on a bar that he clicks lol holy shit that is ridic
---
Haha good luck reverse engineering the algorithm
---
The only gripe I have with this logic is the fact that it costs $15/month to keep playing classic
---
Private servers are free
---
That's a big difference for a lot of people
---
Not for me - I'll likely keep my membership active even though I'm only doing a couple of hours a week.
---
I one shot a level 45 warlock today with a 1,876 Death Ray. Wasn’t a crit either.
---
I’ve done brd a few times and I definitely get more xph solo, in fact that’s often my experience in any dungeon unless I’m in a semi stream lined group of knowledgeable players. Def hoping to get in to brs ASAP but I wasn’t high enough level till today.
---
I once walked all the way between the tram stations. it was't worth it.
---
That sucks.  I'm horde on Kirtonos, and it doesn't *feel* that unbalanced in the 20s zones, but I'm also a little bit behind the leveling curve.  Other Horde were talking in chat about how it was impossible to set foot in Hillsbrad because of Alliance gank squads.
---
Wow that's good to know you've made is so high so quick. Assuming you went single target Frost? Mind telling me what your /played time is?
---
That's very true, humans do have incredible endurance when traveling long distances.
---
But here is the catch: The moment you notice a bear, he already smelled you for a while, and is close.
---
And the moment you first notice a tiger or cheeta, or other ambush predators, is the moment it strikes ;-)
---
Yeah definitely getting that at 40!
---
Here a gold from the Horde. :)
---
I mean, you might as well grind gold..
---
Yes after green you can continue to cap put happiness. Like after you become exalted there's still 1000 more rep to gain.
---
Spam feeding just wastes food. Got to wait for the "feed pet" buff to drop off before giving them any more.
---
That's considered a server first.
---
I've done it. I mean gone like 4 hours of sleep... Multiple times a week.
---
It will probably jump in price when Bg’s come out
---
I am not native and this mistake is fucking infuriating.
---
&gt;	you can clearly see every herb around

Apparently not, as shown via this thread.

&gt;	youre a fucking moron

Also this is an example of why you’re a douchebag.

Calm down there Hannibal Lecter.

I wonder what scales it. I Crit a 2.1k with it but all non Crits were 850-1100. My level? Spelllpower? Engineering level? I’m sure the exact math with come out soon enough
---
I got enough runecloth bolts and leather at level 40 by fishing mithril chests from floating wreckage to make 6 of them.
---
Yes. It includes WC3 Classic which is both roc and tft.
---
how much is it?
---
Unzips...
---
&lt; 1% on my server and faction. At least yesterday evening, of ~6000 scanned characters there were around 20 at 60, and abour 200 or so above 50
---
Rockpounder solo, Ravager for aoe
---
&gt;It sounds right, but it's not right.
---
I beg to differ.
---
where is it shown that you cant see any herb around? ive never had any problems whatsoever, ill say it again, yall fuckin blind
---
Cooking is great if you want to have more HP and stuff
---
You can't see when you do it. Only people around you see it
---
Thought so, thank you. I didn't know it shows on the log so couldn't know for sure
---
What class and spec twink ya making.
---
Am going to be making 3 in the long run. Hunter, rogue, Druid.
---
Maybe, priest too, just to have a clothy.
---
oh fuck this is gonna be me D: got 30g at 35 and can just feel i'm not gonna make it
---
This was me, countless times
---
On my phone, but yeah. I did. I think it was from the classic section on icy-veins
---
Complicated to explain, but by far I feel the playerbase in classic is people that missed playing the entirety of vanilla wow. They feel totally left out that they did not get to experience the beginning of a very successful franchise. 
---
This effect is so strong that they lie by the 1000’s here on reddit and everywhere they can about their experience with vanilla wow. 
---
With this said, the game as a whole is a total culture shock to a very high majority of these people who joined wow somewhere after original release. 
---
In objectively observable reality vanilla wow has very little “good” features when compared with even BC, but it was a crazy adventure to learn everything and try to clear content with your friends and online family. 
---
Now we are rereleasing and old game where everything is know and recorded, so asking these spoiled players to work hard towards a goal that has been boiled down to nothing but BIS lists and boss tutorials is just killing them on the inside. 
---
They will learn or not that the game overall is super fucking easy in today’s world and that only large amounts of time and social coordination are required. I give it 2months before heavy atrophy sets in and we start losing retail players by the 1000s because they don’t enjoy farming MC for 4 months.
---
WC dung?  Well at least you're in the right place for it.
---
We spent about 1hr 30min clearing it. I was lowest at about 26, and we had 2 dps above 30. Then we spent another 30-40 minures in a cecond run in order to complete the quests. Ther was actually nor enough questitems for everyone.  I'd say wait until 24-25 at least.
---
That's fucking retarded.
---
&gt;	 • entirely inside large bushes

 • blended into the color palettes of tree groves
---
 • in a not obvious corner of a barn
---
They all take a second of head scratching and double checking. If you don't know which piece of foliage it is you'll be scanning with the mouse as highlighting it does nothing unless you already know where to put your cursor. Come off it dude you're being a douche for practically no reason.
---
Here’s a few. Honestly, I wish I had better eyesight but I don’t. People aren’t asking to change it, just remarking about it, you dense fuck.
---
Oh dear I levelled my alchemy and herb up and now seeing this totally forgot about secondary skills.....
---
Clever girl...

It's not a particularly rare trinket, but gz I guess.
---
Put your pet on passive first. I use
---
/petstay 
---
/petpassive
---
/cast freezing trap
---
/cast feign death
---
It's the same for any other kind of trap. I use something similar to run into packs to drop explosive trap for aoe pulls
---
It’s not about the grind homie!!! Just enjoy the experience no matter how long it takes
---
Since gathering nodes aren't shares in classic, they can't use this for farming, so the economy isn't disrupted, even for skinning. 
---
The only thing this is good for, is helping him level &amp; PvP. Since PvP is a server choice, that's your problem that comes with the territory. 
---
And the leveling is his gameplay so it's not against ToS.
---
It's also a huge pain in the ass to setup properly &amp; get working correctly and in sync. Then you have to have hardware that can run all those instances of wow. Then you have to pay for it.
---
Honestly, I consider it more work than it's worth, even for PvP. 
---
A good multiboxer has done his share of homework &amp; gets a nod of respect from me.
---
...  
---
I am sorry, but i have to  
---
Did somebody say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Easier as in faster? Maybe. 
---
However, a rogue will have it 'easier' in terms of having more CC if they have to pull more than one mob though and more panic buttons if they pull too many - both options slow down the grinding process a bit but if the alternative is a long walk from the graveyard then it's still the better option.
---
That’s what server maintenance is for
---

---
Mmm... is that staff of Jordan on a hunter?
---
The important thing about Classic is that being an areshole has consequences. Every time he does this, a few more people add him to their ignore  list and pretty soon he won't be able to get a group. Cross-realm servers broke that important tool of community self-regulation.
---
undead is by far the best race for PvP for both horde and alliance. Nothing came close
---
Herb/skinning here and 22g @ lvl 30
---
I did these quests just fine as a 38 shaman. Group up for the leaders' heads and you should be fine. 44-47 is extremely overkill
---
I'm in a small pvp oriented guild. If you're interested you can pm me.
---
It's part of the bread crumb quest line that leads you into Gnomer. Not sure what level you need to be, but go to the engineering hut in Org and grab the quests from the 2 goblins there.
---
You literally just have to power through it. Mid 20s to Mid/High 40s is filled full of getting fucked by someone higher level than you. Eventually you just get through it and it gradually gets less brutal.
---
Most of the playerbase (on my server) is in the level 30s-40s range.  Why start sweating raid nights when we are still in SM, Ulda, Mara, RFD, and RFK? The most important thing right now is for GMs and officers to watch player participation within the guild. Who are the helpful people? Who are the players willing to drop what they're doing for a guildie? Who are the team players?
---
You can't PUG a 40 man raid until everyone completely out gears it, or you have a bunch of Uber hardcore EJ types. The guild I'm in has 600+ members, and it's a "leveling" guild FOR NOW, but we always have 100+ on at any time. 
---
Are you telling me we can't get 40+ of those people geared for MC or Onyxia? We can, and WE WILL. Everyone is here for the same reason. We are all working towards a common goal.
---
There are 60s on my server, but I'm not seeing any LFG BRD or UBRS or LBRS spam. 
---
We're building a community here. The bosses won't die if we don't.
---
I thought winterspring, not 100% sure tho.
---
So you think it's okay to ninja loot?
---
It was classic like server, so he had to work a lot more than few mobs. Still wasnt that lot of water for a single person. A lot all in all.
---
FIGHT MILK
---
That free server transfer they're offering you would fix it.
---
How do friends stop you getting ganked by a full group of people all 10+ levels above you? The point remains.
---
Pvp severs just mean gank servers
---
Hi, /u/Donkey__Balls

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2l1sy/whats_all_this_in_trade_chat_about_thunderfury/). 
---
I‘m not even an english native speaker but I cringe hard when I have to read „would of“ because it is so wrong.
---
This. SO. MUCH. THIS.
---
This ain't retail. You can't be a dick and guild hop and ninja ftw. 
---
I LOVE my leveling guild. We all have eyes on  raids, but in the meantime we are all just helping each other.
---
Is it rly that. Bad? Mograin feels perfectly balanced hell it even feels like an ally server sometimes
---
You should watch and see what the rest of the group is doing.  Priority generally goes to anyone who is equipping it immediately. If not everyone needs/ greeds.  Just needing shit because you think it’s valuable could get you black listed.
---
Yes. I am.
---
Mind, I love blasting cocks.
---
can you please hit me up with it if you can?
---
yeah bro.
---
Yes
---
That doesnt work
---
Many similar games this is a violation of ToS akin to botting so it's a valid point.
---
Think they will force me to change my priests name? Autistico
---
It's not fun, it's necessary. The more I slow those rogues down, the less that will be ganking me in BRM.
---
neat
---
Yeah, there's a classic version
---
Only if you actually need it. You can need and someone else can need roll if they need it but don’t need roll something that’s a slight upgrade for you but the other guy needs the same thing and it replaces a green quest reward item or dungeon blue for raids.
---
You must have really upset someone because blizz is extremely slow about getting around to suspending for names.
---
As you can see in the screenshot, my ElvUI map seems to be a bit off. When I hover over the map the location at the top of the screen says I'm hovering over something completely different. This makes it rather difficult to check where to go for certain quests. Any ideas what may cause this?
---
If you NEED an item then you press need, if you don't need it then you greed it.
---
he bitched about multiple separate instances, mostly the gankings of people GROUPED who I'm assuming are his level ; and one instance where 5v2 who are higher level have a chance at success.
---
I am sure I have seen that kind of run-up in some anime.
---
You fuck with the wife, you lose your life.
---
An age old discussion that you see on here plenty. Really depends on your group. I’m in the camp of massively valuable BoE’s should be fair game for everyone not just their specific class. But some think the opposite. 
---
For example if a Staff of Jordan dropped I don’t think the only caster in a party should get it. With most BoE’s of that value people generally sell anyway and I imagine a mage even if they got it with no competition would sell it too. 
---
If you are farming them, just open it up for discussion early. People like to change their minds AFTER they miss out.
---
In case that doesn't work, then this should:
---
    /console groundEffectDensity 16
---
    /stopmacro [mod:shift]
---
    /console groundEffectDensity 80
---
Not my proudest fap..
---
Holy shit you're a loser.
---
I would go through all of this and then my altitis would kick in and I'd abandon the character for my third warrior or some crap.
---
Same lol just dinged 16 today
---
I wanted that name for my warrior also. Sadly it was taken. I think youre being reported only because some retard dude wanted your name and couldnt have it. F
---
It's the warriors. They have to get that execute off.
---
Unsubbed
---
Happy Cake day.
---
I have nothing else.
---
Bad warrior
---
Why not talk to people in game?
---
Yeah for sure, basically if they want to shield you, they should be casting renew instead.
---
Shield also gets around gnarly mechanics such as heal potency reduction.
---
Ideally you can trust the priest and this macro isn't necessary, but keep it in mind if you have trouble with bad priests in pugs.
---
Twinking with no main, honor, or even bgs?
---
Interesting. If that is representative across servers, that is a way lower number than I thought.
---
Why is he running away from a character with a dot at low health? Are you sure it was a player? :D
---
My old vanilla server had a group of 3 guilds that would raid together. They did it successfully for years. It all takes a lot of planning though.
---
Imo rare blues and purple go to a roll regardless of if people need it. If it's a guild run then it would be a different story. In a pug I think everyone should just roll.
---
Level 18 here with 16g and 140ish tailoring
---
I dont have time to actually play so i just sit in the AH and bid on things about to end that i can resell or vendor for a profit while im studying
---
Yeah, but people try to pass him off as a one-off joke rather than a planned part of Warcraft. It's a little harder to dispute an actual quest chain about a Pandaren in vanilla.
---
I just do crystal trees now, groot and over double 99 farming xp is enough for me
---
Its really annoying that all SM runs are mostly just looking for mages and melee cleaves
---
&gt; Most hybrids didn't want to heal
---
I get the feeling even now. I've seen shaman DPS in groups  more than mages even (I'm the tank) and only one or two those I played with bothered saving mana for emergency situations. Everyone else always seemingly wants to blow all their mana in the first few seconds, which is really anboying sometimes.
---
Haha, its my first time on classic. I'm still figuring things out. Gonna bind each of those to a key soon and organize it better but I'm trying a mix of enhancement and restoration. Got frost shock in there too though
---
In World PVP, no such thing as a fair fight.  (I learned that lesson in EVE.)
---
Oooooooh that's dirty.
---
You can do that in classic too
---
Lockpicking is not an ability tho, it's something you have to spend time to level up. And quite a bit of it. I think it should be up to the Rogue to decide whether he wants to charge on it a bit.
---
Blizzard recreated WoW just to get another chance to ruin it.
---
But scales...
---
That's the battle stance bar tho, I highly doubt he would ever use it in that stance
---
You answered your own question
---
You could always just set it to Need before Greed then you can only roll on things you can use.
---
I took a shot it that too. I supposed you are on Herod.
---
Wtf why would you do gjat
---
First thing you do is to put strafe left on a and strafe right on d
---
I appreciate you
---
TIL, in Classic you fish water.
---
Blizzard is an SJW company. We can't have anyone's game experience be ruined! They made the same change with mages polymorph. Player griefing was a part of vanilla whether blizzard likes it or not. #NoChanges.
---
Scratching my head on that one. Dont see anything wrong with Rawkfist on a normal server. 
---
I'd try to appeal that, but calmly.   
---
That's weird.
---
Stay Ret. 
---
You can heal perfectly fine. Just make sure you have some intellect gear. It can be bad greens.
---
I refuse to believe any of you Ally's have any trouble finding groups on our beloved server, it's near impossible to get any of you alone, and I swear on my mother's grave a ran into a raid group of you guys camping nesingwary's camp tonight in strangle throne.
---
Yep, sounds about right for a leveling warrior haha.
---
If you really want to avoid it you can dungeon level, some of my mates are 50+ and once they hit 30 (contested zones forever) they haven't done a single quest.
---
SM 28-42.  
---
ZF 42-52.  
---
BRD 52-55.  
---
LBRS 55-58/60.   
---
UBRS 58-60.    
---
You miss out on the atmosphere of a PvP server and I can only imagine the tedious nature of spending 24 hours /played in the same dungeon back to back before moving onto another for 24 hours /played but they'd have rage quit long before now as they're only on the PvP server because the majority of us play PvP.
---
Great :)
---
I've seen some Paladins AoE farming with Consecration.  Is that a specific build used to AoE?  Probably requires a reliable group as well to play that way.
---
Now give me an excuse for the hunters, Rogues and shaman I see chasing em down too
---
This doesn’t answer your question directly but you can use @mouseover macros in Vanilla (I don’t think you could back in the day).
---
Example:
---
/cast [@mouseover] Spellname
---
GeForce Experience shadowplay. Quite useful thing.
---
When Kharazhan (dungeon) came out with 7.1 that was a good example. While the general route was known thanks to the raid version, most runs still took at least an hour for the first weeks. And fihuring out the Nightbane secret was also one of the best parts.
---
And that was in Legion.
---
I wouldn't consider it PvP but it was absolutely intended. That's the point of having to tame the demon...
---
Puttin' on the Ritz - Taco
---
Prepare to do a lot of running back to your dead body.
---
oh fuuuuck Kreygasm
---
Can you releasing near the flightmaster and keep banishing them? Or thats nerfed as well
---
But they were also immune to everything that couldn't target undeads, such as polymorph.
---
I don't feel like explaining exactly why this is wrong so I'll just copy from the warrior discord 
---
&gt; White damage is not normalized, but most yellow damage is. Choosing between two weapons depends on the relative proportion of white and yellow damage. When starting out leveling, white damage will dominate for a long time, so all you should look at is weapon tooltip DPS (setting aside extra stats).
---
&gt; If/when yellow damage starts to dominate, then you should choose a weapon based on maximizing the normalized part of the damage formula, which is based on the average tooltip damage of the weapon : (bottom end + top end) / 2
---
For example, Arcanite Reaper has a damage range of 153 to 256, so the average tooltip damage is 204.5. Another example, Crystal Spiked Maul has a damage range of 168 to 252, so the average tooltip damage is 210, therefore on average the Maul will out-damage the Reaper (again ignoring extra stats and weapon racials).
---
This is a good example of why looking at just the top end number (256 vs 252) can lead you to making a wrong choice. Reaper's top end is higher, but on average it does less damage.
---
&gt;This is where "slower is better" for normalized attacks comes from, and it's usually good advice. All other things being equal, a slower weapon will have higher average damage. But if the slower weapon is slightly lower dps than the faster weapon, the only way to be sure of the correct choice is to look at the average damage.
---
Everyone on guild told me to walk that way but walked from stv to Badlands without interacting with anyone or any high level mobs. It just felt shorter.
---
Oh interesting, why do you say that about PvP?
---
heh, yea probably.
---
Enchantrix not updated to classic, isnt it?
---
Yeah, this just happened to me. Whoever had not abandoned it was gone for the last 10 minutes according to the line of people. Guess I'll just do it later?
---
You don’t have to buy reforged, it doesn’t work yet anyway but ~~Activision~~ Blizzard is trying to use deceptive tactics. 
---
If you dig through the old battle.net pages you can find the old version and purchase a license through your account. It’s just not easy. 
---
There are still people playing wc3 to this day. There are dozens of us!
---
1: Respec is very fucking expensive
---
2: It not easy but doable
---
3: 2 handed weapons
---
RNG is RNG. Probably thinking it’s helping and noticing an improvement even when it’s not there.
---
As a healer, seeing anyone’s health bar below 100% makes me nervous lol
---
The first 2 zobes (till about lvl20) are protected, after that entering any other zone flags you for pvp automatically.
---
U and me both bro'
---
I can't even count how many warriors I have saved in Classic. They always seem to struggle when there is more than 1 mob on them. Makes me feel sad as I know that even if they do survive they have to spend good time eating while me as druid can just heal myself and go back to cat.
---
So when I see low warriors I will make sure mobs get killed, warrior is on full hp and buffed up. And then toss /hug to make them feel a little bit better.
---
Welp In Fairbanks, alliance appears to be non existent in any contested area , perhaps it's the layer I'm in though.
---
Sit down and grind for hours to level up quick.. first of al that aint quick and second it doesn’t sound fun to me at all.
---
Also what i thought
---
I knew I was back in Classic when the Hunter jumped down in Gnomeregan and didn't know to dismiss his pet first.
---
HE feigned death and lived, of course. The rest of us did a corpse run.
---
Think is, if the Guild Leader that become overthrow declines the overthrow he will be removed from the guild. As poor sports will not be tolerated, it will prevent that from happening. Drama is something that drive people and give them excitement. Therefor no rule breakers will be tolerated to prevent excessive drama and to bring in only positive diplomacy and networking among the Guild. A ruler might be in power for several month, until someone can recruit enough members to overthrow the current ruler.
---
Legit LLOLed out loud
---
What the shit did I just watch? That was amazing.
---
I've had a couple encounters like this so far, the first was a night elf hunter attacking me out of a the blue while I was in one of the towers in hillsbred, I dont know what he was expecting but I quickly feared him and his pet into pretty much every mob near by, as I ran away unscathed he did not live to tell the tail. The second came at the hands of a warlock as I walked along the road in arathi highlands, I don't know what he expected he dotted me as I walked his way so my reaction was fear, despell what I can, add my own dots, wotf his fear and mind blast and mind flay him to death as he made a confused pikachu face.
---
I have only gotten bad locks in my party who go from 100 to 20 IN COMBAT! always scares me and districts me from the tanks HP, I also had a lock who loved using hellfire every pull.
---
Good roleplaying opportunity if you're into that sort of thing. Your human died and became one of the Forsaken
---
Because you want to PvP at 60 with gear, not shit on random people leveling.
---
Same. Thought I was the only one who noticed.
---
Dude, most people have not hit 60 yet, most people are not going to be killing Rag in one month. The people who are already 60 are a tiny minority. Most people are still in 20s and 30s if census mod data is to be believed. They're also not normal players; they're so dedicated to the game that they're already 60. If you put in that much time and know that much about the game, you definitely know how to run the raids.
---
Regardless, a month is only 4 weeks. That's only 4 MC and Ony runs, assuming that you did them the first week of the game. That's not really enough to get a character decked out in raid epics, especially not for 40 people. Rest assured, phase 1 can last quite awhile with no one losing interest. New raids in vanilla were released several months apart.
---
PVP is at 60 not when you're trying to level up as a 45 and 2 50+ gank you mid pull :|
---
I naturally had fewer issues when i managed to get a bit ahead of the leveling curve.
---
now the opposing faction players I run into are pretty high level. But they never actually attack because I assume they got to where they are by grinding efficiently.
---
There are a lot of players doing quests, dungeons, and just in general being in zones that are too high for them. I can sympathize with the warriors in Arathi but c'mon.
---
Healer here.  As long as the tank doesn't charge around a corner or way out of range where I *can't* save him, he's free to pull while I'm still drinking.  The only hitpoint that matters is the last one, so I usually have plenty of time to drink before entering the fight.
---
I also think this is General modern gaming mentality
---
It does but lava hits for like 600 every 2-3 seconds
---
On my server (Dragons Call, Germany) we have around 70% Horde (number from an addons with 60k players registered on my server).
---
It's hard.
---
Did this for the first time yesterday but there was no one at all to see me
---
Ran dm last night as a mage and didn‘t get s single drop except of grey shoulders. Best feeling ever!
---
I thought rogues didnt ha e feelings? :P
---
Yup, nearly all the BoE epics actually suck. You're better off case in nearly every case with the gold. Pressuring someone to equip a bad item and no one getting the gold is just dumb all round.
---
Go Cath until lvl 42. Then Ulda until 44. Then ZF
---
I’m going to be cynical but what did a google search come up with?
---
I also encountered similar bug in ST as a warrior. Charged, fell through the ground to the bottom floor from high above but kept charging through the corridors back up, pulling everything on the way. Charged for a whole minute there. It was glorious. :D
---
Ability pruning happened so when He With No Life returns to the game the players are not prepared.
---
Uldaman is the next dungeon, 40 may be a little low for it but perhaps its doable. After that is Zul'Farrak
---
Just for leveling. Everyone is doing these "cleave" runs. Once they get up there at BRD and above, it probably won't be as effective. At least not at the start.
---
Another option is just swim to booty bay from westfall and boat to ratchet
---
No he's not the best, only for PvP.
---
Damage scales so a pet with attack speed 1 deals less damage than one with speed 2, in the end its the same dps. Though Brokentooth is a nightmare for casters.
---
Also, things for some reason might not work in the past however for some reason work in the future. Lots of things didn’t work in the past that are now popular amongst players
---
My friends (and even relatives) all play in EU servers but just like you I live in Japan. Honestly I can't stand the 300 ms.

Join me on Yojamb一緒に楽しもう(笑)

Transfer while it's free.
---
Congratulations! Remember though a good warrior gets enough sleep, eats good food and has his professions leveled 👍🏼
---
So wrong it hurts. Top damage of weapon matters since you have MS an ability that does weapon damage and does not rely on your swing timer. So does WW.
---
Back then the whole eredar = former draenei did not exist. I explicitly remember them being made the same thing was a retcon in BC
---
I'll add one thing as a healer. Sure if you want to take your time that's fine but when you pull 2 things and I'm falling asleep in my chair because there's no one to heal. That's an issue
---
That's not a bug but a 1.12 feature.
---
Why would he when classic is better?
---
It does still matter for instant attacks.
---
Its mostly this.  Even the raids, tanks would be getting 1 shot if in full greens.  Its not a question of vanilla raids or dungeons being hard mechanically but they did have a lot more damage.
---
Even nost was harder than this and it sort of took me out of it.
---
Word of caution, I've heard things are going poorly with this company and saw people complaining on the company's Facebook page that they've been waiting ridiculous lengths of time for their product with no answers from support. I'm not going to go check back on it myself to see if it improved because I'm about to fall asleep, but I recommend potential buyers do their research.
---
I have a razer deathadder and had the Problem that normal clicks would be interpreted as double clicks frequently. It stopped at some point so maybe it was an addon problem
---
doesn’t really matter since you’ll always have the honorary aspect of guild leader, they’ll just have slightly better privileges and once people hit 60 it’ll just be the same regular guild exactly like if the first to ding 60 had just made their own guild anyway
---
One of those things you do once then have to rebuild energy reserves.
---
I'm in my 40s and play Horde and always have. Maybe it's just bullshit to make insecure people feel better.
---
When I stopped playing the first time around in OG classic, I quit when I first hit Tanaris. It holds a special place in my heart that I never explored it while level-appropriate.
---
We could always make it nsfw.
---
It has super high traffic, therefore it would be affected at a faster rate and it would seem worse, correct.
---
You can compare anything to anything, it all depends how you do it.  I feel I did a fine job making a comparison of situations, you're welcome to try to make a better one.

---
Meh to be honest the "run all over" to get the water totem was a bit exaggerated. I thought it was going to be difficult like everyone mentioned but it didn't take long to do at all. Sure still made you go some distance but not really that far at all.
---
Any attack based off wep dmg for a 2 handed wep uses the dmg mood f a 3.3 swing wep so not realy less they haven’t normalized it for p1 but they did that in 1.08 or1.09 so unlikely
---
Get a sword and go for sinisters. Backstabs are viable when you can reliably spam them. This may work in pvp or dungeon/raid. While questing you can backstab from stealth or gouge (well, cheapshot and kidneyshot may buy some time for backstabing, but they are for higher levels). For the first you'd better ambush. For the second bandage. And for ambush you'll need to spec into it so that you can oneshot mobs.
---
I see what you’re saying however, any level about lvl 25 can start a overthrow to prevent lvl 60s from ruling forever
---
Put them on ignore.

Ravager is 37

I have noticed a pattern that people only rant about the game when they aren't getting their instant gratification from getting a certain item within x amount of time. Also known as infantilism.
---
Where do you get your numbers?
---
Thats not accurate he doesnt giv a quest
---
Say looooooot!
---
Okay so hes grinding mobs, how does this affect you?
---
If you want to dps all the time don't pick a class with a heal button.
---
best thing for blizzard to do is not touch a thing because it violates the spirit of classic, there’s a war on and the alliance are losing it
---
I don’t even know if the faction imbalance is true anyway because all the keyboard turners pile on alliance for the pretty models so they’re not going to contribute to wpvp which might be part of why alliance are getting banged on most servers

Idk I'd argue it's the rogues chest. He can open it. I'm a healer main here. Resto shaman so it's not like I'm a follow rogue supporting him just adding to the situation
---
Yes I am, thank you, Captian Obvious.  And thats how comparisons work, you compare two different but similar things... I feel like I shouldn't have to teach people this...
---
I only record gameplay with my Motorola RAZR. 640x480 is more than enough to see everything.
---
Word of mouth.  I have noticed this to be a trending discussion.  Ask around you will see that quite a few people are reporting high horse/ally ratios.

Bigglesworth Booty Boys is the best one I've seen so far.
---
Do you have any insight on Seal of Righteousness vs Crusader for leveling?  When or how to use either one?
---
I had a boomkin in ZF. That sweet 3% crit
---
&gt; 5% health
---
is it really a benefit though? how often does a tank drop that low for the 5% to matter? WoF seems like a no brainer for tanking horde
---
Why would that happen?
---
You'd be waiting hours to hop into battlegrounds as a horde player in the situation you described. Why would you willingly sign up for that?
---
There's plenty of servers that have the alliance greatly outnumber the horde too.
---
i take every locked chest if you dont like it make keys
---
Nah.  Would insta kick that rogue.  You sign up as a team with a set of skills and you share the rewards with the team.  Simple as that.
---
The orc peons since the original Warcraft games would say this when they were selected. Peons were also depicted as not the brightest.
---
All he said is that it's the new name for it. Not that it was new.
---
Alliance has no honor
---
We only show servers that have guilds signed up.  Unfortunately it looks like there aren't any Sulfuras guilds registered or they haven't selected their server yet (likely signed up before server lists were public and haven't updated it yet).  Check back later and have your guild register if you end up joining one in-game!
---
Word of mouth is not an accurate representation at all.
---
Classicrealminfo.com

What if I told you, that worshipping trees isn't the brightest idea, if you face a faction of skeletons and pyromaniacs.
---
Interesting input.  Thanks

Alliance is the more hardcore faction this time. More world pvp.

Check out ItemRack classic

Haha, good one.

Yeah, not there anymore tbh.  14 years ago i did that. But now, older and with kids, no way, i would die halfway trough the day hahaha
---
And where are their numbers?
---
My main annoyance is those who now, for some reason, think that AoE is they key to clearing dungeons quicker - without understanding or caring about the limitations of the group. That, and some peoples' inability or unwillingness to group up for kill quests. Makes no sense.

Blaming retail.

After getting my mount at 40, this was my second goal, get bigger bags. Made more than enough gold at 41 to buy 4 of those 14 slot runecloth bags. The price was reasonable too, 3g per bag. Yes I spent 12g on bags but the payoff of being able to loot more stuff/skin and vendoring them made me way more than I spent for the bags.
---
I see a lot of people talk about systematically sleeping less than 8 hours. I know the average in the US is 5.5 hours.  This is not good for you. Since you're playing wow I would recommend the following podcasts by Peter Attia on sleep:

spotify:(https://open.spotify.com/episode/1TTvHnUQyTH1m17ARaRKxb?si=L6gHbcRCRgyfTECnUSuVOg)

It's a bit medical, but it might help you convince yourself not to cut into sleep. 
---
Butchered quote: "Over millions of years evolution through natural selection cut every corner possible. But it found it necessary to spend 1/3rd off the day seemingly doing nothing and you want to change that?"

As a warrior this hurts my soul.

Thanks for the link I will check it out
---
I do this non stop to warriors then pat them, if they charge the poly I kill them.

For one you taste delicious, second I'd eat the tauren too.

I mean is it even a fight if your 10 levels higher then a lvl 19 warlock. No it's not. But that's ok. I have a druid that can stealth and I'm patient enough for you to let your guard down

If you dont want pvp dont roll pvp server

There's ways to make money with everything, yes some will be better than others but that doesn't mean you can't make money with your chosen profession.
---
Pick what you like or what you think will be better for you then work out money making later.
---
Tailoring is a good way to make money so one can offset the other not everything needs to be maxing gold made.
---
It's classic! Enjoy the possibilities of everything and don't think so hard
---
At the end of the day, play how YOU want to play. It makes little difference you can heal as shadow for ages, or you can heal as holy or disc it doesn't matter until high end stuff honestly.
---
go skinning and mining

Vast majority dislike WotLK changes. Hence why it was the downfall. Not Catalcym. Common misconception because the record sub number was in WotLK. But in fact that was only on drop of expac. It steadily declined after.
---
People just randomly guessing or what. It's at the engineer trainer in UC.
---
if you want money then do skinning and either herb or mining
---
professions are really only good in the late game

Couldn't tell you where they got their numbers.  I made this post because of what I've heard.  Another comment down below includes a link that I'll be browsing over.

I'd never call daily quests in TBC a problem, as much as I hate the concept of daily chores and time gates. Nothing significant was tied to them, it was mostly just bonus stuff for casuals to do as well as an easy way to make some gold and get some nifty things in the process.
---
That's what was so great in TBC, they added a bunch of systems to the game, like heroic dungeons, 10 man raids, arenas, that everyone had something to do, without jeopardizing the core gameplay of the game. The progression system was so fine-tuned, if you weren't a super super top end PvE player (PvP had arena so literally endless) you were never out of things to do.
---
Contrast this with say, garrisons, one system that basically invalidated everything else in the game, and it's really impressive how TBC managed to expand on so much while hurting so little.

I got that one, then noticed Runecloth bags were only 3.5g each on the AH. Now my 43 rogue has all 14 slot bags. So worth it.

Play alliance . See 10 horde in contested questing areas , hope to see one ally to group with while you are the

Seems like a problem on all the PvP servers. No idea how they can fix it

That's a pretty bold statement from a guy with friends living in a tree. Might wanna fire proof that thing a bit.

---
Haha, I love your enthusiasm you have towards your server!  Currently we only show servers that we have guilds for so unfortunately it looks like there aren't any Rattlegore guilds registered with us at the moment :(  check back later, hopefully we can get some to register :)
---
All the word of mouth stuff is based on more anecdotal evidence. It’s so hard to tell because depending on level, zone, later, server it will be different. Maybe more casual players are on one side so their low leveling areas are more populated, maybe on that server their faction is on the higher side. 
---
With anecdotes like what we are seeing posted like “this zone is so one sided” people will read it and think hey yeah I guess that’s true. Planting that seed makes it easier to make people believe it’s true when it’s really not as bad as people make out. No different to the economy stuff that people went on for days about until blizzard said “nah we checked and this is false” 
---
Only blizzard knows the true numbers. Only blizzard can do anything about it. People getting numbers and obsessing over it will just make the problem worse because people by and large would prefer the winning/popular side. Why fret. Enjoy the game. Communities are still young.

Always nice to see a fellow priest helping out our warriors.

Friend dinged 30 yesterday and I took him through the quest to get his WW Axe at level 30. Had to grind so many trolls to get their tusks that he actually hit level 31 before we managed to get his Axe. Slapped a +5 weapon damage enchant on that SOB to make it look real nasty!
---
He was ecstatic after and probably grinded mobs all night as he has today off work.

It's all about money

This guild is a small group of new players to WoW Classic who want to expand into a larger gaming group. We're seeking other players, old and new, interested in a social leveling experience with the ultimate goal of completing raid content. 
---
No application is needed as we are still forming a core group. PM for more info
---
 There's a little key on your keyboard, it has prtsc printed on it, try pressing that one and see what happens.

Level 23 priest here. I am still using a greater magic wand but my other gear is decent like the staff of Westfall. I have 5 talent points in the wand and the spirit talents and some other points in the shield and fortitude talents. My DPS is much less than other classes like rogues, hunters, mages, etc. Is that to be expected even when I’m not healing?
---
Going to test out yours as soon as I'm home. My biggest concern is the fact, that you can't use it the way it was in vanilla even if you'rs is going to work 100% of the time because you are forced to not move at all in order to feign death AND drop a trap.
---
The results are fucking horrible. Partymembers think you're a retard when trying to catch a mob running to the healer and instead of a trap I lay to the feet of the healer and in PvP it's absolutely gamebreaking. I'm so glad I'm on a PvE Server. I don't want to imagine the pain all PvP Server hunters have right now. You're basically dying to players &lt;10 lvls down your own since you can't reliably bring distance between you and your opponent.
---
And here I am as a Horde player on a Horde-dominated PvP server getting ganked by groups of 3-5 Alliance 5-15 levels higher than me constantly while questing. Everyone has different experiences.
---
Right, guy comes off like a whinging baby.
---
It makes sense. I mean we refer to the allied forces in WWII as 'the allies'. I think it's very similar.
---
&amp; now I know, thank you.
---
stick a few points in resto, get some int gear and advertise as a healer, I doubt anyone will notice you’re mainly enhance unless you’re under levelled
---
What guide is this? Asking for a friend. Is it an add on?
---
How much are these guns selling for on your server?
---
server first and pug should never be in the same sentence
---
Just pretend to be resto when ure in dungeons
---
The other night me and my buddies were in a cave in arathi highlands trying to kill quest mobs with a low drop rate.
---
We enter a section of the cave and see a gnome mage. As soon as he sees us, tags all mobs in the vicinity and starts aoeing them all down. 
---
Later we return to that section and see that he has a mob sheeped and is very low on health and just sat down to eat. So my buddy walked by and hit the sheep with his staff and the mob insta crits and kills the mage.
---
I have also seen quite a few horde even in places like Westfall lol.  I'll check out some numbers because I'm honestly curious.
---
thanks for letting us know you got a mod, did you have any questions or something?
---
thought it was a generic rant. Turns out it is story about born of mad inquisitor.
---
Just heal in enhance spec
---
It's still silly that they let people do it. It's banned in other games for a reason. They are cloning and broadcasting keystrokes. That's close enough to botting imo. The problem isn't the fact that they are hard to deal with, or a person is using multiple character at the same time. The problem is, and always has been using the same mouse and keyboard to clone I puts.
---
Except the number of level 60s ganking lowbies rises every day. Raid rosters are filling out. Groups for dungeons harder to find
---
Yes! I too think Mograine so far feels so well balanced
---
Do you have the other faction in that realm?
---
Bonebiter Axe from the SM quest chain is better than WW Axe.
---
why
---
Aaand saving this for later...
---
Ele/enh for leveling and leveling, get the Mana off healing spells if you plan on mainly healing in dungeons but that's all you'll need ubtil around 50ish
---
Questing as resto is torture.
---
I got it from my first kill :&gt; I was so lucky
---
I love your dedication GG!
---
*mE lOvE yOu* said the orc sarcastically, and lopped the gnome's head clean off.
---
Cleave groups are cool and all but don't rely on it IMO
---
Then, indeed by how much. 40k an hour—solo—means 5 hours per level. Many 60s got there through the previous exploitation of the raid xp bug, so barring them from comparison, think about how much *potential* for improvement there actually is. 
---
Could you change rotations or find a location that lets you swing 80k an hour solo?  Probably not. But assuming you could somehow double your already-impressive pacing, you’re looking at 10 hours. Provided you keep your pacing, it’s 20 hours. 
---
So I suppose the question is: how much are you expecting to reduce a 20 hour task down to?
---
Hi. What’s the add on That lets you see your group on the left?
---
no
---
yes, so? Does it hurts your tiny feelings?
---
I just wanna point out that you, with an alliance flair, posted the horde mug first. Zug Zug
---
Guild master?
---
Not worried just thought this was a discussion worth visiting.  I'm on a PVP server and I see lots of horde but it didn't bother me.  But I do hear alot of people complaining which led me to question if there are any ramifications to having a potential imbalance.
---
Well it’s a good Pet Quest guide anyways. 
---
Doesn’t mention any of the gear quests. 
---
Like the one for BFD, or the ones for the old lady in Swamp of Sorrows, or most importantly: The Enchanted Gold Blood Robes.
---
This exactly. You can clearly see the decline slowly happen since the merge.

that and the IF auction house
---
Oh my God I did exactly the same! And looks very similar to yours

If you split them up his macros will go to all hell.

Because they are braindeads which have nothing interesting in life except these silly events in-game.

You get the quest for the necklace from the horde side from salvage sons? In northern side of the drag
---
Ah, I see what happened. 
---
What I meant was that *verbally* it sounds right. "Would've" and "Would of" are verbally very similar. Honestly, when spoken, they sound pretty much the same. 
---
In theory it's the difference between "would've" being a direct move from D to V, and "would of" having a pause, but most of us don't pause for that. Most of us *say* "would've" but hear either or. 
---
Hence: "It sounds right, but it's not right."
---
Or: "If you say it out loud it doesn't sound wrong in actual usage, but when you put it on paper it's clearly wrong."
---
Being bad and lacking knowledge aren’t the same. That said, we were bad.

I also Looking for this

In vanilla during the first several months I used to look at the wowcensus data a lot. Every server but one had an overwhelming alliance advantage up to 10 to 1 in some cases. The server with the 4 horde to 1 alliance ration was my server unfortunately. A guild that was split up into 4 separate 500 person guilds basically ran that server for quite while and decided when we got to use our griffon masters, banks and auction houses.

I wonder how much of it has to do with the effective slaying of the lore characters at the end of Cata. The dragon aspects are all gone, Thrall is gone....

I got that thing back in tbc on my pala, dropped in Tanaris. Didn't sell well since it's not a ywink weapon, but goddamn what a feeling.

I'm not really duoing with anybody most of the time but I'm planning on going disc/shadow until the 40s

Spirit tap, imp pain, 3/5 resist and mind flay in shadow

as a level 40 warrior, it doesn't get any better

I never felt like this worked much in the past but maybe it's worth a shot. What do I have to lose.

A warlock that starts a fight at 20% HP in a group will be well over 50% HP before they ever pull Aggro. Even if we do pull aggro, at level 42 I have been able to drain tank and solo just about any single mob I’ve ever gotten aggro from in an instance.
---
On my warrior alt, I don’t even bother trying to grab a mob off warlocks that pull threat since they’ll just face tank it and it’s a waste of my time to taunt it back when it will die in 5-10 seconds.
---
Isnt grindr a gay hook up app like tinder lol
---
That's a really good point many seem to miss. Also heals cost me money too, if no mage is present. That's why I hate it to death, when Warlocks start to life tap until their health bar is only representable by a single column of red subpixels on my 4K Display and expect me to heal them back up. Like you could've just sat down and have a drink, but you chose to extort my role for a free full mana bar. Well, guess what now we wait until my Mana is full again, without any drinks.
---
You go to any big city and talk to the battlemaster for the BG you want to play, and you will be queued and zone in when it's your turn.
---
Skeram is apparently 60-65% horde based on census. It certainly feels like there are fewer alliance. That or they're all aoe cleaving SM lol.
---
Or Orcs until they founded the Horde.
---
There's a census add-on where people share them in discord.. it basically just runs a /who in each zone and gives you a breakdown of how many people are logged in on your faction when they are snapshotted. I ran it last night and we had approx 1300 logged in on the allied side and someone had posted hordes side log 25 minutes before and they had about 3900 logged in.. so was about 35/60 server population at that particular time of day.. the average (on my server) from the many posts have pointed to it being approx 40/60 most of the time. That being said it could well be that a lot of casual players logging in for short periods may be missed in the snapshots.
---
I save my retaliation for anyone who tries to 1v1 me when im questing.
---
Same dm name
---
There’s also just weird mob interactions in classic.  I’ve noticed AOE farming that sometimes I’ll be kiting mobs back with blizzard and then they’ll just evade randomly and run away, even though I had just damaged them a second ago.  Or I’ll get them in a frost nova and they’re evading in frost nova and run back the moment they’re out.  Idk if it’s spell batching or what but some things seem a little funky when it comes to mob behavior.
---
Really good in pvp and really good in duels if played well. In pve you will just go oom after few casts so it's not viable. You will heal in pve as shaman.
---
Install the Guidelime addon, download a good questing guide version for it (there are many) and just follow it and speed run through content. I am sure this is faster then dungeon grinding because you don't have to wait or find people to dungeon grind with. Being completely solo makes it much more possible to keep pushing high xp rate hours and that is what you will need to hit 55 this weekend.
---
If you have completly dependable people to run dungeons with that also make the hours you need. Then that might be faster, but even that depends on a external influence like player quality.
---
You take the potion before the rogue stuns you, so if they try and open with a Cheap Shot you will be immune to it. Yes, the timing is hard, but if you hear that stealth noise or see the rogue in the distance you chug it and if they don't notice they have wasted their opener.
---

If you can time one of these for when they spend all their combo points you can really upset them. It's hard and expensive.
---
Once you have flare and track hidden... they run from you!
---
I think you're idea is a very interesting one that has no reasonable chance of success. Having the ideal personalities for every member of the guild would be too important and too difficult to achieve. But I'm naysaying. Only you can make this happen. It will take effort. If you have a streamerbase they will probably be your best hope and also your greatest weakness. Because they love you they will help and try. But if things go bad in a bad way, you're on the hook to your paycheck for it.
---
All that considered I think the next best thing is to get RP players. This sounds like something that would work a lot better in an RP setting than a real social setting. In this way, people can hide behind their character's motives instead of their own and it provides an extra layer of reality. I've never played in a real RP guild on an RP server, but I always fantasized 15 years ago that this is exactly what it is. People in character 100% of the time trying to pull off a coup against their mortal enemy (best friend guildie).
---
Back then every little bits count. On final boss attempts, main tank are decked out to the brim with buffs, imps, flask, etc.
---
Its also not a super big deal if a mail or plate wearer pulls aggro off of you in dungeons. If anyone gives you grief about it, tell them to wait for threat and stop beong bad, or deal with pulling aggro for dps. 
---
Tldr dont sweat it, you're doin fine :)
---
There should be a blacklist add-on.
---
I’m ele resto and warrior cleave groups absolutely love windfury totem
---
No most people just quest... F this dungeon grind meta man.
---
Had to learn the hard way that zoneing while dead is a free ress..
---
Wait a second, realm subreddits exist??!
---
I did it tonight at level 41. There is zero reason to do it
---
There are a few small benefits of being outnumbered on alliance, BG queue being the interesting one. I'm just afraid of what's going to happen on full severs like Golemagg EU PvP when the layers drop. The world is going to be really dangerous place, especially if outnumbered
---
Hey could be fun, might also not be so fun
---
Sorry, my wife would not agree.
---
What is the refference?
---
imo keyboard turners love pretty models, seasoned players enjoy the variety in appearances
---
alliance has pretty models, horde has a much greater variety in appearance
---
I tanked BFD for the first time in about three or four years. Completely forgot what the torches did, only that you needed to light them to open the door. Managed to get three out of four lit before the mobs began spawning and steamrolled us. Had some good natured ribbing in discord as we corpse ran. Thankfully only the front packs are elite, the back crabs are just standard.
---
transfer away from all friends and a 15 years old guild, sure.
---
Meanwhile I have yet to see an Alliance without at least 3 in their party
---
I did this yesterday by accident in Hillsbrad. I jumped onto a wall of the big courtyard. But that caster mob, councilor started to frostbolt me so I jumped down to the outside. She ran after me through the gate, pulling 10 more peasants and guards.  Right into a mage who was aoe farming in the gardens.  It was very funny to see , because it was so unexpected.
---
I like how it still stunned him right away, lol.
---
I've seen a AQ40 speed clear in 25 mins and a patchwerk kill in just over 1min40s (beserk timer is 7min). Fucking nuts.
---
Earlier i was watching that APES guild clear their 2nd MC and they killed shazzrath in 25sec.
---
Please tell me you have some sort of replaceable screen protector on it.
---
Confirmed on Skeram lol.
---
It did, but flying also irreparably ruined world PvP and immersion in general. It's so much better when you see people on the ground all over the place,and all the zones are much prettier from the ground. If they continue onwards from classic in any way, I hope they leave flying out of it.
---
Offtopic but is there an addon for classic that shows class colors in chat?
---
Alliance are trash...
---
90% of people who roll alliance, even on PvP servers, are only interested in pve.
---
You'll never get revenge because you'll always be out numbered.
---
But why tho
---
WotF + Hardiness is a lot of it probably. These are very strong racials in levelling and wpvp. The only strong pvp racial on alliance side is EA and not many people can stomach playing a gnome.
---
Yes, because that's his plan in the first place you.
---
Also he would probably still kill you on a pvp server given how dumb you come off
---
I love there being world specific holidays. Like, yeah, the Christmas/New Year's/Easter etc events are fun, but it makes absolute sense that orcs would have a holiday to remember Hellscream.
---
Me as a Hunter talking to the Dwarven Warrior Trainer in IF's strategy room:
---
"You wouldn't last  A DAY under my training regimen!"
---
This to a guy who had spent 20 levels in Aspect Of The Cheetah and is thus one of the finest long-distance endurance runners in the whole wide world.
---
It's funny coming from eve and seeing just how much some people would like their hands held.
---
Got \~20ms all the time checked that already. Its only the mages Blizzard which has such latency before doing dmg feels like it doesnt work right.
---
Ahem... 40 year old Alliance boomer here...
---
I hope you dis this once and its not a habit
---
Flying just ruined communities, since people just flew around everywhere. Just add a 160% ground mount or something that has max level req.
---
Well seeing as though only forsaken can eat bodies you can just call it running speed lol.
---
Preface: I only read the tl'dr.
---
NTA,
---
I assume you have different in-game goals than the family guild. Nothing wrong with that and you shouldn't be punished in any way for it. 
---
All families are different though. This doesn't work if you're trying to get out of Sunday dinner at Grandma's so if you've got an unusual family that bonds strongly over WoW you might have a bad time.
---
But how did they agro the mage unless you did something that created agro on the mage like healing him or something
---
for gear just stack int and healing, spirit in second place to those
---
as someone who only played hord and now switched to alliance to expirence the other side, (but mostly follow my brother) I realized is just as bad and sometimes worse than alliance. Or maybe times have changed and there just as bad. Dunno I still help out a hordie when he is about to die
---
But what knowledge would someone have now over 15 years ago?
---
I mean there wasn’t really anything secret about Rag...it was just a regular tank and spank with sons thrown in. I am not dismissing wha you are saying, just genuinely curious what knowledge we didn’t have 15 years ago.
---
It's been the literal opposite for me. Weird.
---
Just kick him from the party.
---
youve already been reported, sorry bucko
---
Yup same here, I need my 8 hours of sleep. No kids, but I'm in my thirties now and working 10 hour shifts where I have to stay focused. WoW is fun, but it can wait til the weekend.
---
I can’t upvote this enough
---
They executed themselves
---
Tbh just quest/dung spam level. You get levels and money. It is the most effective.
---
25+
---
Yeah... Not all of us are willing to pay a speedrunner $5 a month to access a guide that they only recently paywalled because they saw dollar signs in their eyes.
---
Great in PvP but absolutely the worst spec for PvE in the entire game. I only say this because they are the only spec in the entire game that doesn’t bring any unique buffs or debuffs that the other two specs couldn’t bring. For example a Boomkin has a Spell Crit Aura, Feral druids have a melee crit aura even ret paladins and enhancement shamans are more viable because they could wield Nightfall and buff all of the casters damage by 15% for most of the fight. When it comes to raids on the horde shaman is the best raid healer with priest being the best tank healer. Chain heal is absolutely awesome to use.
---
Definitely, this guy is bad at boarding
---
Perhaps he should be working instead of tweeting and watching Fox?
---
Wanna see me go to that tree and back?
---
Wanna see me do it again?
---
So it’s in interface/addons right? Does it show up on the character screen? There might not be an addons button in the escape menu in game if the addon doesn’t have options.
---
There doesn't seem to be enough context here to establish anything. Couldn't the accused be a Paladin?
---
&lt;3
---
This is bs.
---
Because he’ll soon have enough gold for 5 epic mounts with that pet
---
I see people like to push rogues. Just don't get to the point where all rogues have 0 lockpicking and nothing can be opened. All the "services" people are listening here as examples can be skipped. We have food to heal between pools, we have first aid, we can regen. We can travel on foot to the entrance. We can dps without buffs. Those chests will end up staying in dungeons.
---
I can relate to this.  My wife plays shammy while i opted to be a warrior. She gets 40% as well as all the other fancy stuff.  And while she scoots off to find flowers, i just start the travel early and she still arrives before i do haha
---
Yep, to get a mount, amplify magic and detect magic is something you clearly don’t take
---
Agreed...  but the dungeon spellcleave BS is quicker.  It just gives you zero content and no appreciation for the game.
---
Because with even a little bit of healing we can start generating good amounts of rage and actually use our abilities
---
You charged thru multi layers.
---
This is a bs story
---
Gotta build that speed!
---
The title makes my eye twitch.
---
It's still just RNG I'd say. But I kind of believe this too. Did some quests two days ago at the end om my session, killed like 60 mobs to get 5/9 shells, 2/10 bones. Logged in yesterday and started killing these directly, almost every single mob dropped the quest item.
---
I’m a lvl 10 night elf rogue on Azuresong!
---
What's the human racial again? I can't look up from work, but I thought they had a decent one.
---
This is a reference to good fellas, geez.... Kids these days
---
Yes.
---
Thanks for the awesome dungeon runs yesterday and congrats again for your first epic! :) /Youwin
---
Solved, thank you. Private message sorted me out.
---
24
---
Especially the quick despawn makes it sound like a bug.
---
I have no idea what it is using, I am using the /tsm scan command.
---
Please sir, do mind the cock blasts.
---
This person is an outlier.
---
EVERYONE BUG REPORT THIS IMMEDIATELY.  PLEASE!!!
---
If you need help speeding up your leveling process, and you haven't already gotten it, download questie or some other quest helper addon.  Your friend very likely has done these quests 20-30 times already and knows them very well, so he knows exactly where to go, where the not so easy to find quests are, and when to stop questing and grind for a bit.  
---
Continue with Wetlands until the quests become all red and head back to duskwood for a few more levels.  Remember to kill everything you see on your way to and from quest places.
---
Dude wasn’t fully geared, he was fresh out of questing greens, and there were also way more than 100 mages
---
Warrior isnt the best choice as starter character because of the stance dancing and macros a druid is a lot easier to tank with. Anyway just tell them this is your firts time in the dungeon and someone will gladly lead you through, there is so few tank that they will rather help you than try to find another one.
---
Sick reply bro. I'm totally convinced.
---
You can’t put a trap down if you’re playing dead.
---
Perception is their pvp racial and it isn't considered strong really in many situations. It's ok for dueling I guess...
---
For anyone in Tanaris, the chests that spawn at the Southsea pirates and Andre Firebeard location have a high drop rate of 14 slots. Literally got 4 of them yesterday whilst farming the damn hats. Told a guildie and he did the same!
---
There's also a huge difference (imo) if it's being done for retaliation. If someone starts shit with me for no reason, anything's fair game.
---
Basically the only way horde gets into gnomer.
---
You took the path of a Hunter's pet for a second there, now spin uncontrolably in circles trying to follow your target as it closes in on your "master" and manage to not hit it even once at the same time...
---
I was gonna suggest respeccing to BM. Wasn't that the PvP spec back in the day?
---
Feed Me - Alarm Clock. Pretty much anything by Feed Me.
---
hah oh the memories and the damn stirfries
---
I heard the bass on this comment.
---
40 is actually where it does get better.
---
But don’t you need FD to drop combat first?
---
Ok fine, minority of players says that's it's fine and Blizz doesn't give a rat's ass what we think about it. Now what? Nothing any of us can do about it.
---
Chain heal was no good for vanilla. It was all LHW, mp5, and downranking and you had NS which was nice.
---
Ya im screwed for my mount, haha.
---
Me and a friend was farming the elementals in Arathi for our warrior quest, and a skull level tauren warrior WITH THE WHIRLWIND AXE was running around farming them as well. We tagged as many as we could, and each time the tauren came up and gave me one hit to signify "Dont steal my mobs". Soft hordie got mad he got some well deserved contest from someone actually needing the charms instead of being able to sell them with an outrageous markup on the AH
---
i kill everything in my sight as shadow priest. 
---
I hate everyone. I want them to spend time running from spirit. And this way i'll made next generation (if low lvl) angry and bloodthirsty. More pvp, more blood.
---
when there's love in the detail, you know it's classic !
---
TIL everyday language used in a game like eve online defenitely doesn't cross over to wow classic... Guess the Zionists play wow or something
---
That. Was. HOT. Holy hell, you deserve all the praise in the world. You nuked him at half health and zero mana, you absolute savage!! That warrior should just re roll and start over on live, classic is a place for MEN!!! ^don't tell my wife I said that
---
Use questie, and ask for help from your friends. At lvl22 redridge should be optional. I did redridge and then gone to duskwood.
---
&gt; its hostile and YOU have to enslave it
---
I think that was only the doomguard.
---
I hardly ever take aggro from my pet actually. I have growl keybound but while levelling I have it on autocast. My go to levelling pet is a boar. Charge + Growl builds a lot of initial threat. 
---
Are you keeping your claw/bite ability up to date?
---
I also have a threatmeter installed so if I get to close to my pet I just autoshot for a while.
---
I have latency problems too. It shows 60s but it has lag spikes, sometimes even for like 5 seconds. I use my phone as wifi adapter and I hope it is the reason because I know it is not my internet because my brother use same internet and he has no problem at all on his computer.
---
Yeah, as another commenter said, this is a reference to Jimmy "Two Times" from goodfellas.  I would recommend this movie very highly, many memes or other jokes you might know actually come from there.
---
Lmfao. You’re actually trying to defend this. Why exactly? Every rogue I’ve had in my group has had lockpicking, and every rogue has treated locked cheats as just regular cheats. No one has any qualms about rolling on them... except for you. Why exactly? Is this a regional culture thing? The difference between NA and EU servers?
---
don’t worry about layouts I end up showing plenty of tanks round dungeons and it doesn’t bother me
---
Downranking is only effective when you got +heal gear. Focus on larger heals instead of fast ones, get BoW or mana totem if possible. Also try to heal as little as possible so that you regen mana.
---
Come and get it!
---
I like the idea of player controlled scourge invasion. I remember when they did that as a pre wotlk event and it was one of my favorite wow moments of all time.
---
If there was to be a classic+, and I'm not sure what to think about that question jet, that would be a great addition.
---
haha yaeh that place takes a while
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe they standardized warrior abilities to do the damage of a 3.3 weapon speed regardless if it’s slower or not?
---
Dreadmist. It is one of the fresh servers and has pop of old realms. There is no que but it is full of action and people.
---
My plugin has been removed by ElvUI dev team. New version ElvUI 1.0.8 gets support RealMobHealth by default.
---
I'm in the same camp. The pulls where I get a moment to build some rage and threat feel great, but once I lose aggro I literally cannot get it back without rage. And without aggro I'm not getting any rage.
---
Is the trick really to for people to just wait a moment while I build threat? Cuz you know in retail you can never ever stop.
---
Thanks so much!!! I do already have questie, any other add ons you would recommend? May one for finding mining ore?
---
Wf pug?
---
Tbh not enough guilds are high enough on Nogger. They had to pug, or form their own guild.
---
Are you the shadow above?
---
he was AoE farming, so they would have run under his blizzard and added themselves to his pack
---
* **Server:** Rattlegore (US)
---
* **Faction:** Horde
---
* **Detail:** Level 18 Resto Druid
---
* **Looking for** people to level with. Questing mostly. Doing some dungeons for loot/quests. Small amount of grinding.
---
You know channel 4 is called Looking for group? Look it up
---
You can only charge in the air if you are both over the same piece of terrain.  Otherwise there won't be a path.
---
thats etsy for you...
---
I am a fem nelf. Short cloaks look cute :D
---
Am I the only one mildly irritated that the 4 bags face the other way from the main backpack?
---
haha jeez, take it easy fella... or does MCing lowbies off boats and having a go on reddit the only way to make yourself feel good
---
Yeah we tried it yesterday with 3 lvl 40s, 1 lvl 43 and lvl 38 heal. Only got to 30% before the heal was oom. But it was a fun run nevertheless.
---
You play on a PvP server.  You have no right to complain about literally any encounter.  You knew what you were getting into when you rolled there.
---
Thankfully we had 2 mages and a warlock so we just aoe'd em down :D
---
Sick of reading this. I get ganked by alliance a fair bit. Always out numbering me. That’s fine, I rolled pvp server, it’s what I signed up for. Both sides do it, you haven’t played horde on argul because you can’t so you will have to believe me, both sides attack and game and out number at times.
---
No i meant to say i killed 2 things (alone), my bad
---
Exactly. Any warrior charging into a fight against a fearing priest or lock without popping zerker rage isn't a good pvper.
---
Yikes - I can't seem to find your source on your claim (Petopia itself says it's a standard rate), so let's leave this a 2-0 for the record. Not that you'll ever know, because you move the goalposts, turn things around, and then block so you can't even handle the truth. 
---
A specimen...
---
And apparently the mage got away too. Chestnutz is a legend.
---
Shadow priest exist to melt faces !
---
I've been lucky enough to come across mostly friendly hordes so that I can level, as long as I don't steal too many of the quest mobs. But every now and then I get a group of 3-5 people on me or someone just running up to me with their mount, one shots me, mounts up and runs back the way they came from.
---
Worst I've experienced so far is outside SM where alliance seems to be 5-10 people while 50+ hordes are just chillin', casting some aoe on everything that tries to enter.
---
yep, had a party do this to me on the way into BFD last night, while i was on the way out they were on the way in, shaman healed me and when they entered the dungeon, all the pulled mobs came for me.....
---
Their anticheat doesn't generally ban outright. Blizzard usually works with ban waves. So the anti cheat detects and then they start gathering information about the used hacks and the players using them, then after 3 to 6 months they ban a whole lot of accounts using the detected hacks at once.
---
There’s a Kromkrush discord bro
---
There is a mod which marks down on the map every time you mine a node called Track Resources.
---
Oof
---
Perception op
---
Ight bro im bout head out
---
But is alliance only
---
&gt;  FDs that are not resisted but just do nothing.
---
This. This is so fucking depressing
---
From what I remember, the infernal would ONLY be hostile towards the warlock who summoned it, UNLESS you had other players attack it while it was hostile. For example, infernal becomes hostile towards warlock, warlock banishes infernal, you then encourage other players to attack it while it's banished. Whoever attacks the infernal will now be on the infernal's "hit list", with the warlock being the first one. Once the infernal is no longer banished, it attacks the warlock, Warlock dies, uses soulstone to res, and proceed to watch the infernal attack whoever attacked it in its banished state. Once it has killed everyone on its "hit list" (or if nobody attacked it while it was banished), it will despawn after killing the warlock, as the warlock would have been the only player on its hit list. 
---
Can anyone test this?
---
Ah, okay. Thank you!
---
Haha its actually you! Yesterdays runs were super fun!
---
Change up your scenery, fly over to Kalimdor and quest up ashenvale!
---
Yeah I kinda want to know this too. I want to turn those bars above my unitframe into icons.
---
It's a little bit on the nose when someone stops next to you while you're questing, doesn't help with killing the mobs you have on you, asks "can you make me some water?", then just runs away with their water, no tip, no thank you.
---
At first I had a bag dedicated to just have extra conjured water/food to give away to people in need, it's really nice, but too many people are taking it for granted now, starting to feel like a job, without pay, so slavery...
---
The heads quest ?
---
It scales off max hp, so more hp - - - &gt; oneshots
---
Spy addon works wonders
---
And there's still far too few tanks around.
---
It's because there was a bluepost about pandaren speculation when the BC races were still unannounced that said pandaren would never be a playable race because they were just a joke.
---
It's funny because he may have thought you were saying "MURDER HIMM!!" "WE WILL FEAST ON HIS FLESH TOGETHER!!"
---
Are you a Dwarf?
---
No need to run wetlands. Swim from menethil to Dun Morogh spot, drown, spirit rez near ironforge. Tram to stormwind
---
+1 for Zygor Guides, I've also been using them for years, fantastic guides.
---
GET IT GET IT!
---
It scales with max hp
---
As a Rogue this is indeed a dick move. You enter the dungeon as a proper team, and you should share the advantages together. Just like I expect a mage to give a free portal or food to the group in dungeons, I always make sure my lockpicking is at a high enough level to bring that to the table, free of charge!
---
Little do us mere humans know, but that was the most efficient path by far
---
There's actually so many great lines in Classic about future expansions. One of the Alliance quests sends you to the Master of Cheese, who proclaims that he'll only help Mathias Shaw if Deathwing is burning down Stormwind. Another good line has two Alliance citizens discussing the Pandaren, with one of them trying to dismiss the creatures as a myth. 
---
It honestly feels like Blizz could have planned all the way up to Mists of Pandaria in terms of storyline. I wouldn't be surprised at all if at the very least they had a rough sketch of the world, with Pandaria included at the bottom.
---
What lvl are you?
---
Just go for dps with a 2h waepon and charge in if you can in low lvl dungeons and u are fine. As a warrior u won’t keep aggro there on multiple targets no matter what.
---
Once u have monestary gear and whirlwind nobody will compete with ur dps, until you go for a more serious tanking.
---
Looks like you can use modifiers with "equipslot". Can you try having [combat] modifier?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c)
---
Well yeah my thought process was wrong, nvm
---
Gold farmers hate him!!
---
It doesnt. Since its not a warrior ability
---
Not only do I not care about asmon, I care even less about the dozens of youtube channels that steal and repost his content. low effort
---
Yep, constantly getting killed by ?? level players on arugal. Alliance players must hate me.
---
Crits proc deep wounds so it's better than a extra attack. Also, i'm not sure if the extra attack duplicate the bonus dmg (from mortal or heroic strike) which would make it even weaker than crit. 
---
That said humans have a bonus in swords so i don't know which is better.
---
Spend some time grinding mobs that drop decent loot. Things that drop cloth or grays that vendor for a good price. This will give some some good early income from selling these items on the AH or to a vendor and also give you a good sum of experience to level so you can go into new zones with new quests. I just did this at 28 and I’m now 32 with multiple areas to go to!
---
One bolt of mageweave
---
Omelette du fromage is incorrect !
---
Omelette au* fromage
---
Questie + brain. Just follow the exclamation marks.
---
Really? I’m almost up to that level and was really looking forward to this and the Doomguard
---
Wtf?
---
I know :( I wonder what he was trying to tell me
---
Can't wait for McCool to overtake that Malding poopsack! 
---
PepeLaugh
---
Has felt like an eternity for me 😋 I don't get to play all that often, evenings and weekends etc and I'm waaaay behind the rest of my friends who are in their mid lvl 50s now. I'm super happy though 😁
---
I don't actually believe it's that quick in the way I feel and hear most of these groups do it. 
---
If you have a dedicated team of good players willing to maximise pulls and efficiency, that play the same amount of hours you do, then sure it will be faster.
---
But most of these groups I see spamming looking for x and y for clearing z, the moment you spend half an hour to an hour of downtime every time one of the group needs to leave, having to search for replacements, having non synced moments of going to buy/sell or train spells etc etc. I don't feel it is faster anymore at that point 
---
And I suggest just taking a good questing guide/ addon and the consistency solo play provides will probably provide more xp/hour over long sessions then inconsistent dungeon grinding.
---
entire Tirifal zone and UC is filled with subtle darkness, the kind of darkness you've got to look for or read questtexts for to grasp entirely.
---
That's why it's my favourite starting zone.
---
Man the AQ40 gear was.... weird
---
I want one but fuck that's expensive
---
Those are "Aura Bars" or something like that. You can find these under Unit Frames -&gt; Player/Target -&gt; Aura ...
---
Don't know the exact name since i'm at work now.
---
hit him with that /mourn
---
And here I was, excited about hitting 22 today lol
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
Yeah whatever dude, I get ganked by alliance like it’s their job. You can make your point without saying that “playing Horde is like playing PvE.”
---
Care to explain on that?  Lot are you just talking out your ass on opinions? I’m not saying I’m right but I want to have a real conversation about this. Not just say no it won’t work or no it’s gonna work.
---
Indeed, it was far to early to show our hand! Putress really fucked up by showing the world the power of the New Blight before it could be shipped across the continents and used on cities instead of just a field army.. Oh wait no, traitor Putress, Forsaken had nothing to do with this! *hides vials under a bush*
---
Horde also has:
---
* Extremely easy way to travel between continents (I'd kill for those zeppelins)
---
* Extra flightpaths in key zones (looking at you, STV, Badlands, and Swamp of S)
---
* Easy access to the most popular dungeons (only missing out on DM and Stocks - hell, they even have a port to Gnomer!)
---
* A fair few quests granting blue gear while alliance is stuck in greens (Ashenvale quest; SFK quests; actually decent BFD rewards for melee classes; etc.)
---
Meanwhile, the biggest advantage of the Alliance is that Darkshore is an amazing zone and the Ony attunement is less painful.
---
I was Horde back in vanilla, and when I switched to ally in private servers, couldn't believe how inconvenient shit was.
---
It seems blizzard just created their own private server, what a bugged trashcan
---
Are you not checking the box at the top of the add one window to load “out of date” addons?
---
If this was intentional I guess I'm starting over as a druid.
---
These are the emotional pvp experience that are much harder to find from the sterilized pvp environments of battlegrounds and arena. When things are 'fair' then there is no emotional stake. A loss just means a very quick release and then you are back into the action.
---
TBC started the end of world pvp (arena, flying mounts, summon stones) and by the end of WOTLK (dungeon finder) it was basically gone.
---
imo he thought he could end it really quickly, forgot he was fighting a priest
---
"Oy mate, y'no where I cud find a pint round here?"
---
I don't agree with you entirely. I consider myself "younger" when it comes to Vanilla WoW because I couldn't play it when it released. I was still in school, had almost no money and my parents refused to pay for the sub. I wanted to play it, but I couldn't for that reason.
---
And yes, I am used to reward feeding gameplay from other MMO's. (If you look at my posting history, I talked about it in length there.) And I was also one of the guys who had a very high expectation level when it comes to features that are standard by today's gamedesign standards. Like having a group finder for example.
---
All this said, I still enjoy my time in WoW Classic because I now realize that you don't need a lot of things to have fun. It is nice to not have this constant need to progress with your character level and equip as fast as possible to keep up in this treadmill. I can spend my evening skilling fishing and feel like I did something that brings me further with my character. I can spend 3 hours in one dungeon, taking it slow and applying tactics like sleep enemies because otherwise the damage output on the tank is way too high for me to heal. Something I've never really had to do in any MMO for the past 10 years. And that's a refreshing feeling.
---
So please don't play the "younger people" card. Because we also can like things from before our active MMO gaming time. That's like you saying "You are not allowed to listen to 80's music because you are too young and will not enjoy it anyways" That statement is not only wrong, but also upsetting to people who want to keep an open mind to many things.
---
So instead of asking OP why he feels the need to write this, maybe you should ask yourself why you have the need to instantly jump to conclusions about what "younger" people will like or not.
---
Zandalar EU seems pretty balanced.
---
i had a lvl 42 tauren warrior with complete Herod gear farm those... and kill me multiple times just with his weapon proc.
---
That's crazy, because Grobbulus is the server I play on
---
Same
---
Lol I did that today
---
you can see me shoot out a /sad right before he dies, doesnt matter though because its not a gesture lol
---
Ohh yes... The Weapon Feral Druids used to farm on Ends just to be able to use them on bosses in order to do a Little bit of damage :D
---
I remember a guildie that literally spend all week in gnomeregan just farming those xD
---
Classic... Good times for ferals :P
---
Sorry, but someone has to say it... your dress doesn't match your belt. THERE, I SAID!
---
Oh lawn he... still comin
---
Yooo I don’t know what to skill on my troll shaman, any advice? :D
---
What are you playing?
---
5.5h average? Damn, I need 8+ to function properly. Wow is not gonna change that.
---
Absolutely, no need to binge it anymore.  Have seen it all before anyways, so just taking our time when we have time, and some evenings even play something else (pretty vivid WoWS player as well). 
---
No need to burn myself out. Just go slow and have a ton of fun :D
---
"Ahh it's just an adventurer.. so you have chanced upon our lair have you? Or perhaps destiny has brought you here? ...
---
...well whatever the whims of fate have in store for you, know that you stand upon the steps of the home of the mighty Blood Inc guild, an old house whose traditions and honours date back a thousand years!"
---
Hello! We are Blood Inc.
---
We are an old Alliance raiding guild first established in 2005 and are now operating on Mirage Raceway (EU PvE).
---
We are taking our first steps into a new world and desire to finish filling our ranks with active and dedicated members for the journey ahead.
---
We seem to have more members of the 30-40 year old range that have played Vanilla in the past but are open to you as long as you have a mature attitude, a desire to have fun and to get on with your guild mates. Ideally you would be online most evenings and have a desire to raid 2-3 times a week.
---
To start with we are very much a social and questing guild with no requirements or commitments, just come and play with us when you're able to get on.
---
Eventually the time will come  when the guild is ready to raid and the team will be formed. We will be looking to hit Molten Core on a Wednesday and Friday and a Sunday evening for Onyxia. There will never be compulsory attendance and there will never be DKP. Our loot system is to be based on common sense with progression in mind and that stays true to the core values of our guild.
---
Ultimately Blood Inc is all about the fun, the ride and respect for our fellow gamers. If this is something that resonates with you then please consider membership with us by coming to our Discord and saying "Hello!"
---
See you in server!
---
https://discord.gg/D6MfS8p
---
Yes but that affects the one above my bars. I want the blizzard icons next to the minimap gone. Like the Ghost icon or when I cast AI or Armor spells, or the debuffs that mobs put on you.
---
I want those icons gone so I can use the ElvUI options exclusively.

But this is awesome. I will definitely use it lol.

Got an invite?

Ass man bald and mccuck. The two biggest wow streamers on twatch
---
Probably lots of vods on YouTube that will show you. Basically just dot and run. You can do it in any specc.
---
It's ok once you get MS and whirlwind + keeping your weapon up to date. Before that though, it's rough. More tedious than hard because eating after every second fight is annoying, also making sure you never fight anything your level or higher helps.
---
I signed up for that Grindr thing, and asked some dudes if they wanted to go into the stockades with me. 
---
one guy asked if i wanted to top or bottom, but i just said tanking and  he got abit confused but said okay. (i dont know if he means the upper part of Stockades, or the bottom part with the elemental)
---
We're gonna meet up in 10 minutes!
---
I specifically stated EXTRA threat in my post. And even with Ret aura a strong FPS can pull off if they attack a secondary mob not your primary target

GatherMate2 also works in Classic; and I like it more than Track Resources. (Though, not that I've ever died in game, that "Don't forget to turn on resource tracking" after a death (which I've never had) is nice to see. Or so I would think. Had I died. Ever.)
---
I believe GatherMate2 has a downloadable Classic database of nodes, too, but I haven't used it.
---
See that?

---
You have inspired me to be a better priest. Things have been going the exact same way for me except I'm still waiting to awaken. I realize I can't wait! I just have to be brave and go for it!
---
You could never get quest items with skinning.
---
Use SoR. Judge on cooldown. Ignore SotC unless you are fighting a mob that takes a long time to die. Otherwise it isn't worth using the judgement cooldown on it. SoR hits hard and so you should typically just judge it. Note, holy damage is not reduced by armor.
---
 Just clear things up in the start of every run.
---
Need for class&gt; need for profession&gt;greed.
---
I had a guy rolling need for everything and said its for his alt so yeah he is on my ignore list, fuck you Pappyxd from Zandalari Tribe.
---
Also use /roll for mines and chests and other things people might find desirable.
---
this.
---
That is disgusting. Congrats.
---
Its mechanically the hardest class to play properly, the end game rotation is pretty much impossible to pull of properly. Pvp is very hard to do well, and requires a ton of knowledge and training vs each class. The auto shot mechanic is very OP, but only if you can stutter step properly.
---
Hunters have the highest skill cap and the lowest floor. Mages for example are rather hard to play badly, you can be much better then most, but the gap will never be as wide as it can be with hunters.
---
I play dreadmist and don't feel it's empty. I'm level 40 kinda regret I chose alliance on this server though.
---
Dont let wow be a priority, let life prioritize itself and peel off wow as necessary.  I replaced time spent watching TV with wow.  Maybe helpful?

Classic will still have a place. Private servers have shown that a demand has existed. I think the current demand is wildly overblown, but it's not like every server will be a ghost town in a few months. I think there'll be maybe 4-5 Classic servers per region left over, and they'll all stay around medium-high pop for a year or two.
---
I'm all for waiting, but if you need to take a 3 minute scenery break between each pull and sip white monster, then im gonna go ahead and solo a mob or two.
---
p00r bois salty

Obv he mistyped magmatrain
---
I've never had a rogue ask for money to unlock a chest in my whole 15 years of playing this game.. you are wrong on this one bud. Enjoy soloing Ubrs
---
U don't need to tank. Warrior dps is decent if you keep up with weapon upgrades.
---
Im at 9...

Run along, you don't seem to like being held to your own statements so you give the boilerplate dismissive response to evade.  
---
I'll bet you're great at falling-in-line.
---
nope
---
Anything that drops aggro
---
Definitely I got quest items like this from skinning in vanilla
---
I play on Grob, and let me tell you, if you think getting ganked by groups of 5 orcs is bad in STV, try leveling in hillsbarad with 10+ alliance carpet bombing low level horde. Don’t be too salty about dying to the opposite faction, it’ll happen. Unfortunately, you are a traitor to the horde and a KoS
---
I agree with this. Every time I feel like I've written enough macros I learn about some more functionality you can do and I go back and change everything around.
---
“Look, I washed for supper”
---
Any idea what addon is used for the enemy health bars?
---
RAAAGH ORC EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN POOR USE OF GRAMMAR.
---
You’re *adorable* ❤️
---
You watched to many animes.
---
We need a WoW Classic: Charge compilation video.
---
You have been Gnomed!
---
In the buffs and debuffs tab just uncheck the enabled box and the buff icons near the minimap will disappear. It shouldn't affect the ones over your health bar.
---
NTA guild and community are important in classic. Finding the right guild is a big step to having a great experience.
---
Narrator: Why do I know so much about weed? Well, because I AM Michael Scarn.
---
They added one later then maybe? Every Man for Himself? or something like that. Damn. I'll just have to lookup when I get home probably.
---
I don’t ever remember this being a thing.
---
Level 15 and you have shoulders? I was 23 when i got my first grey shoylders.
---
What's funny is Metzen, much much later, said pandaren were originally intended to be the Alliance race in TBC. They swapped them for draenei very early on but the idea was there. It's why they were hinted at in vanilla.
---
Probably depends most on what weapons you can get your hands on!
---
I think it's actually one of those things where your brain makes your eyes play tricks on you.  When I took the SS it was brown, but now looking at it, it looks green.
---
I just did the yeti hide quests in feralas and they dropped both from the mob and after skinning them. It is only very specific quests that allow it.
---
[And then they are going to cry about it on the forums or on Reddit](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/838/Untitled-1.jpg)
---
Colorblind mode maybe?
---
Interesting that now pugs get server firsts not guilds. Ez MC.
---
Yeah the yetis in feralas did this when you needed thier hides
---
I guess I thought Blizzard would do a better job of balancing servers. I think they could be way less passive about it than they are now.
---
30s? The rune alone is 20s dude
---
Rule 3: No witch hunt or brigading. Also, it's the last boss of the dungeon, i had the except same drop combination and i too was the only one needing them. So the only thing he's guilty of, without you giving any more information, is not saying bye.
---
Lol, no shock there.
---
I wouldn't of thought anyone would of noticed it tbh
---
18s per portal is the cost
---
It's to bad they aren't going to change it back along with polymorphing other peoples tags and other anti-griefer changes, guess you should quit.
---
Yeah but two or 3 guys can take someone 10+ lvls higher
---
Fuck that life
---
Oh so i misunderstood your question. Dunno about those unfortunately.
---
I'd say generally it's sword for humans and every other race axe.
---
How do you move?
---
I'm a hunter and usually die in pvp. 
---
Yesterday an orc warrior and undead warlock ganged up on me while I was fighting a turtle in Foothills. I was at 70% health. I always try to fight back but it's always futile. I suck at pvp.
---
However, for some reason I killed the Warlock way before he even got a good hit on me and for some reason I got his Orc-friend down to less than 20% health before he ran away like the spineless scum he is. 
---
With just a few % health left I let out a "Yeahh how you'd like that!"
---
II ended up being finished off by two mountain lions and the other guys proceeded to camp my body.
---
Would have.
---
Preach! Ya you’re gonna use your best weapon of course. It’s not really up to you, just the RNG gods.
---
This will get you round that ‘impossible’ task of stance dance macros. Why on earth do people think this is difficult, it’s a total piece of piss - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NHzocF_Hebg
---
I'm lvl 50 enhance with only 10 points in resto, I just keep a 2nd set of int/spirit gear in my bags and still heal dungeons just fine. Enhance maybe be faster for leveling
---
Yeah, but only if everyone knows that everyone is rolling need. The story I was referring to had everyone roll greed on a shield, except the tank, and then a mage also rolled need on it and stole it from the tank. 
---
Obviously communication in these groups is key, and clearly establishing some sort of loot rules would go a long way, but I don't see that happening in most pug groups.
---
This is why you save your movement speed potions
---
yeah, just checked auction for thos robes of arcana and ints 1g 20s and no recipe.
---
Looks like a game of cat and mouse.
---
Wait, /u/Droochainz are you Nutpete on Herod? Add me! Talador, night elf warrior
---
Yes I did this and reloaded and it didn’t work. They were still there.
---
I even tried all combinations of having both of those boxes ticked on and off and nothing makes the blizzard buff icons go away.
---
That orc brought dishonor to his family. Lok tar ogar
---
Excellent story!
---
Yea. I just got the ability to make these. Then I see they are basically selling at cost already... sad panda.
---
It looks like that orc is bleeding through the nose on portrait. Poor lad!
---
I've got 2 addons that are supposed to disable the Blizzard buff/debuff bar icons and neither of them work. Not sure if there is a larger issue with removing the Blizzard icons from the top right of the screen.
---
Wait til you get to plaguebloom in felwood.
---
the ratio is bad?
---
I keep hearing this idea repeated, and I'm always confused by it. If you want a natural continuation of Classic WoW, TBC is about as good as you can get. It's pretty much like Vanilla, except with more balanced class design, dungeons more in the vein of the wildly popular Scarlet Monastery and Dire Maul, and crazy new environments. Hell, in some ways Burning Crusade was harder and more grindy than even Vanilla at the endgame, due to just how insane attunement was. 
---
I'd be perfectly content going through the Dark Portal again, and I'd even be alright with a return to Northrend after. Modern WoW only really began with Cataclysm, and that's when I'd want Blizz to go the Old School Runescape route and make some new content in the vein of Classic.
---
Same with Flamelash. I can quest for hours without seeing a fellow player.
---
I guess that is your tail in the middle?
---
Lol, your post made me realize I do that too. Warriors by themselves are the only players I mouse over to check if their okay, and will usually heal them to full even if theyre doing fine.
---
My wife sleeps heavily... I wait for her to fall asleep, and then go play WoW for a few hours in the living room before coming back to bed.  She hasn't noticed at all yet.  I swear it would be so easy to cheat, if I was into that sort of thing instead of something harmless like video games...
---
That's why I only play pvp hah!
---
time to reroll i guess
---
Why does this matter?
---
Without knowing the add on:  
---
Why have a condition at all? Don’t you just wanna know when dodges happen?
---
questie
---
you can deactivate everything you dont like
---
It's low threat, low damage per rage, you lose rage for it.  Sunder increases all physical damage (not just yours, although from a post yesterday, it would be more personal damage than HS too) AND is big threat.
---
weakauras
---
This is the reason we wanted classic
---
"Say my name."
---
"The Dad who melts faces"
---
"You're god damn right."
---
Ah see I assumed be popped it on the second fear since OP said he broke it early.
---
Could be wrong though, either way I feel the warrior should really have won that.
---
I wanted to also add that crit will benefit from the extra 20% crit dmg as well which the extra sword proc won't get w/o itself critting.
---
Nice dude
---
We had a Mage ninja [Boots of Avoidance](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14549/boots-of-avoidance) the other night. Just a random drop while we were running ZFK. Super annoying but so far it's been the only bump in the road.
---
I got quest skins from skinning the yetis in feralas for sure in classic just a few days ago. For 2 different steps of a quest.
---
I'd rather cut the top off of a 2L bottle and use that than pay 60 dollars for a mug.
---
Yep he was a bit shit. I got lucky!
---
Btw does anyone know why I cant level my skinning while it is orange to me? Skinning a mob orange to my skill should increase it %100 right? It does sometimes but not always, feels like green level rate.
---
I have. I chose Weaponsmith &gt; Axesmith for Arcanite Reaper and the 15% Spell Damage Axe.
---
Fuck off or dont comment. Not in the mood for dealing with troll cunts.
---
Desperate Prayer was the human priest skill. Fear Ward was Dwarf.
---
I'm still trying to figure out if it's a joke, or people are that retarded once again &gt;,&lt;
---
If you can still see a spark of light, you are caring too much already.
---
Hey what is the addon you're using to get that clean looking text?
---
If you want to play a rogue, then just play a rogue man! I know that it feels like you spend a lot of time into your mage now, but compared to the total time at 60 it's nothing. If you have any doubts about mage now, then definitely switch because rogues are pretty awesome.
---
Thank you!
---
Kromkrush is reaaaally bad haha.
---
But its amazing when the alliance all form a union and clean out a zone together. When we unite, we always win the pvp battles. We had a legit southshore vs tarren mill today as well. But usually its just a group of 5 horde killing and camping you as you try to loot one item for a quest and realizing you just cant do that quest because of that.
---
Its doable and for extra fun play a tauren  and /train as you pass the mobs onto them
---
In pvp it's great. Also nice for leveling from around level 40 on. Way faster kill speed than Enhancement and i only have to drink every 5-7 mobs, sometimes less.
---
Good info, thanks!
---
And would you say the threat issue is a problem in raids?
---
felt so bad to go to bed at 0100 am yesterday - started to level a new character with a friend I made a few days ago - we had so much fun that leaving him with "sry dude gtg because I need to get up tomorrow for work" made me feel empty inside - yet after seeing this post I am also glad that with my 36 years and the second take on WoW Classic I at least got some self discipline :D

#showtooltip Spell Name

/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] Spell Name
---
I've seen this posted around, but the one I'm waiting for recolors the actual health bars to the class colors. By any chance do you know how to make that work. I tried typing in a console command I found for it once but that one didn't work.
---
I wasn’t there yesterday, but Sunday I was the lock running around dotting all them horde until my group was ready for brd. That was a good time
---
nah I think its great we should be able to skin furbolg too
---
That is actually wrong. The horde quest starts from the engineering trainer in Undercity.
---
This!
---
Made about 40g just from skinning on my way to lvl 34. So many corpses.
---
Splashed out on a 20 slot soul bag and 3 rube cloth bags because warlock haha
---
Happened to me in prague. Told him I was just here for a visit and want to a hotel XY. He brought me to a hotel with this name but it was the wrong one on the other side of the city. He laughed at me and drove away
---
Damn dude... I'm at 4 and thought I was over doing it.
---
I have herbalism and skinning professions for the money. But if I’m gonna try and focus pvp I heard that engineering and mining are ultimately the best (few YouTube videos I watch) does it matter or is there a significant bonus to engineering in pvp?
---
It makes me immensely happy that people get triggered by insignificant things like this.
---
Haha thank you so much! Glad I could put a smile in your day.
---
Actually you use berserker rage to break fear so diminishing returns start and the priest or lock can't just wait it out and fear you after
---
Remind me not to gank you any time soon
---
20s, rep discount applies
---
Can confirm this is the correct answer. Why do people bother answering when they don't know the answer is beyond me.
---
Lol yeah what the fuck? I'm almost st 300 lock picking and have not once asked for money when opening a chest...
---
This is only true on heavily imbalanced servers.
---
I have always been lucky enough to not play on such servers and our worst ratio was 60-40.
---
Never had such problems, played both sides and got ganked just the same by same classes spamming the same emotes.
---
I have also never seen Alliance being affraid to fight back or anything. Well yeah I have, just like with the Horde when they were greatly outnumbered. So the story is still the same.
---
I was just questing in Redridge 2 days ago when a 44 Troll priest and 38 Undead rogue started ganking lowbies. 10mins later and there is a 60 druid comming in hot killing both and he corpse camped them for a good while.
---
Everywhere I ever went the same shit was happening on both sides.
---
He did not. He wasn’t very good. If you read between the lines you can see it in my post. I think he thought he had an easy kill but got more than he bargained for.
---
A good metaphor for the new RAF program.
---
[https://youtu.be/i1nPGM-2Q0w?t=890](LITERALLY all I could think.)
---
Duo leveling as a priest with a lock - gotta constantly tell him to tap and pull more things.
---
Stop stressing about getting every mob on you, especially in low lvl dungeons. Peel for your healer, dps should deal with overaggro themselves
---
Does it not annoy you carrying another full set of gear? Also do you have resto gear for every slot?
---
He probably wasn't in berserker stance. Don't think you can zerker rage in battle stance
---
Have course I noticed
---
Only if it's pve server.
---
Divinity 2 is the closest thing to D&amp;D on PC right now (apart from like actually playing D&amp;D on Roll20 or something)
---
I really enjoyed  this read. I normally don´t comment in the wow section on reddit, but this was epic :)
---
Psh, what's gonna happen to a giant tree? Have you ever tried starting a fire with logs only? Ridiculous.
---
I stay up way too late as a habit, I sleep 10 hours on weekends, 5-7 weekdays. It’s 1203 for me rn and I gotta be up at 6 am
---
Maybe yours. Let's not represent everyone.
---
Aren’t these the first two bosses of this dungeon? So the player just loots and leave the party without finishing the dungeon. Pretty selfish.
---
Thanks dude!
---
I had already have IPv6 enabled on my router and my provider has support. I've just clicked "Use IPv6 when possible" checkbox in network settings
---
I think it's more that they don't understand they need to wait for threat.
---
Just play at night. I only got ganked once in STV.
---
Well sometimes it's the fastest way. I mean if you don't have a risk of dying AOE is the fastest way
---
Its a donkey
---
Drain tanking vs void walker
---
Peraonal preference, the fear of an opposing player rolling up on me keeps me on my toes, and honestly, awake.
---
Crafting your own gear, even if it isn't necessarily efficient, is EXTREMELY satisfying.
---
I'm almost at 278 and I think its scummy as fuck to charge for lock picking
---
Post their name on the forums ofc
---
Congratulations
---
Thx
---
They painted the horde banner on the right mug wrong.
---
Mmmm, dinosaur eggs.  /Drool
---
Do you run the script as a macro or can you add it to auto execute on load or something?
---
That's what pen and paper D&amp;D is like; every level feels hard earned and a huge step up in power by giving you actual choices at every level. Even the few levels where you just add some more ability points; those points make such a more noticeable difference from just a couple that videogame stats ever do.
---
Just wait phase removal
---
thats nice to know - I'm lvl 34 and had quite a few quests for hides/skins and never got a single one from skinning... and I remember for sure it used to be a thing
---
Yer I did. Never seen them that high.
---
OMG this is awesome 😂
---
I haven't initiated a single fight yet even though I run past low lvls all the time, I rather spend my time leveling for now. But when I get to lvl 60 I'm going for revenge on all those horde parties of 5+ running around ganking me.
---
Best thing they’ve ever done.
---
Maybe it's just playing on an RP server that makes people more patient or something, but I have yet to have a bad experience with a group, either in the outside world or in dungeons. Tanks are waiting for mana and CC, dps wait a few seconds before going ham on any bosses, and people don't immediately rage quit after one wipe.
---
the first 2 and the 2 only
---
Once you get Sweeping Strikes and Mortal Strike you'll level faster than a Paladin but still it's very difficult to die as a Paladin because you have so many defensive cooldowns compared to a Warrior.
---
maybe you get a Failed attempt? you don't get skill points for that. dumb, I know, but I don't see any other reason..
---

I'm from Prague can confirm. Taxi drivers are assholes here

Bröther
---
I was opening chests. But with all this talking - I have 0 lockpicking.
---
Oh no, they were an annoying ass rep grind. 
---
Modern WoW ain't got shit on TBC when it comes to rep grinds. The only way to unlock Heroic level dungeons in TBC was to grind rep for the appropriate faction, and each of the dungeon clusters had a different associated rep you needed to get to revered. 
---
Well that doesn't seem to bad eh? Wrong, because you also needed to do those heroic dungeons in order to unlock attunement for the raids, which meant that unless you were willing to grind the hell out of mobs for Obsidian Warbeads or complete loads of quests, you weren't going to be able to get into Karazhan, Serpentshire, Tempest Keep, Mt. Hyjal, etc. Not to mention that some of those places were also gated by your ability to fly, which was a huge gold sink in and of itself.
---
Yeah but more than likely they are getting a skill point from unlocking it... so it's not like the rogue doesnt benefit
---
Bigglesworth also the unofficial stoner server. 😎
---
gnome to short to make it. or to dumb to not try to intercept on the way down.
---
I tried selling mine for 1g few days ago not really knowing what it was, didn't sell after being on there for 24h.. So I just equipped it myself haha
---
Had a guy say he was rolling need on all loot for silver, in a dungeon.  Everyone abandoned him after the first boss.  So he may learn some day.
---
You could ask around if there are any accelerator programs you could use whilst there.  I live in mainland China and found one which gives me 150-200ms while playing on US servers (otherwise it's around 800ms).
---
What about dungeons?
---
Shadow is bullshit until 40
---
So take spirit tap 
---
Wands 
---
Then go holy
---
Nostalgia be like: "I've been kicking ass since the dawn of time"
---
That was a massive pain but very much worth it
---
I just exhaled through my nose with slightly more force than usually.
---
There is a shop tab in the character select screen. You can transfer via that or if your realm has a queue they will let you know you can transfer while waiting.
---
It doesn't even revolve around you anymore, nor are you some random warrior in the world. It's the worst of both worlds; you're THE NAMELESS CHAMPION WHO SAVE WORLD but all you're really doing is standing around just off camera while all of Blizzards characters have things happen to them and get plot development
---
Wow priest can press need on a shield, ninja! Welcome to vanilla. :)
---
Would have
---
No that way it doesn't feign death before laying the trap. You only want feign death to go off in combat not before
---
I see you speak fluent Magni as well! Please go heal some of the wörld's open whyynds!
---
Sounds like a paladin
---
I use it all the time, you do have to spam it though
---
More like running with them to retail it seems
---
The kid at the end that gets nabbed by whatever creature that was lmaooo
---
Elvui with all the fonts changed to PT Sans Narrow.
---
Yes you will have good damage - no question.
---
But your mana and mana Regeneration is next to 0 (at least it feels that way)
---
And being oom against some1 that is melee is the worst Feeling ever IMO.
---
Thats why I much rather Play enhance in pvp :P But Ele is super fun too - so don't let me put you off playing ele :) I'm more of a melee guy anyways
---
Honestly, if there's a caster mob in the group, I'm going to just tank it as a combat rogue, while burning it down and keeping it on lock down with kick, gouge and if necessary, kidney shot. This may change in higher level dungeons, but it's never been a problem so far and I'm level 43 now.
---
It gives the tank time to establish threat on the tougher mobs too.
---
Ofc no. What about low level mobs? Some of the mobs I skinned was green level to my character but orange level to my skill level. Can it be a reason?
---
What exactly do u take in holy for leveling?
---
Wait, 40 years old qualifies as a boomer?
---
Don't threaten me with a good time
---
You invested so much into high pop server, don't leave now when it finally will come down.  Rather take ques for a few weeks than ending up on dead servers
---
They did, however some abilities are still based off weapon damage, and slower weapons have higher damage. The difference isn’t as big post normalization but there is still a difference.
---
/r/thathappened
---
My main is a Warrior for tanking, but I have a reroll for playing with a friend new to wow. 
---
I made a warlock because I wanted a gnome and wanted to try something I never played before (it's really fun). I make sure to give a health stone to every warrior I encounter in the wilderness  because I know how a single pot can save your ass.
---
In west Philadelphia born and raised
---
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
---
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
---
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
---
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
---
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
---
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
---
She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
---
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
---
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
---
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
---
I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it"
---
First class, yo, this is bad
---
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
---
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
---
Hmm, this might be alright
---
But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
---
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
---
I don't think so
---
I'll see when I get there
---
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
---
Well, the plane landed and when I came out
---
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
---
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
---
I just got here
---
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
---
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
---
The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
---
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
---
But I thought, "Nah, forget it"
---
– "Yo, home to Bel-Air"
---
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
---
And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later"
---
I looked at my kingdom

I was finally there
---
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
---
I'm just a killing man that's reached his killing prime.
---
Can confirm. Had good wands and went fast, now I’m in the 30s and sad
---
1. Just go ret, your strength is so low at that level the % increase barely makes a difference.
---
2. Yes
---
3. Yes, use a 2H.
---
I don't get it, did you complete DM or did you skip it? Good exp and rewards there. 
---
My advice would just be to discover the world yourself and/or ask people for help in game. There are always things to do. Use the /who function for players in your level range and see what they have to say :)
---
Yeah, I'm thinking of making TB my home city at level 60,i love that place
---
cya in 6 months then

 **&lt;Havoc&gt; | Mograine PvP Server | Casual PvE Raiding &amp; P2 Casual PvP Team**
---
English speaking, UK based 25+ players.
---
Discord -[ https://discord.gg/uPM3eNj](https://discord.gg/uPM3eNj)
---
Contact me in-game on Redz/Redzy or battletag RedzyRussell#2228
---
**Intentions:**
---
Our focus is on preparing a solid roster for our casual raiding team and assisting guildies in leveling up / obtaining gear in preparation for raids.
---
Once Phase 2’s release date has been announced we will begin to gauge guild interest in PvP and build a core premade PvP team accordingly. Until Phase 2 (and onward) most PvP focused players gear will come from dungeons or raids, further emphasising our core value of assisting guildies and clearing PvE content. Raid content will be cleared in a timely fashion whilst keeping things as 'casual' as possible due to IRL commitments a majority of members have. Work, families, etc.
---
**Rules:**
---
1. Respect one another’s time. At the end of the day we all have bigger things going on in our lives with limited time to play. When you CAN play, we want that to be the best time you can have as part of the guild.
---
2. Be willing to teach new players and assist on everyone's journey to 60 and beyond. You're only as strong as your weakest link.
---
3. Get involved with the Discord. There is nothing like being in voice chat with your guildes during leveling, dungeons and general day to day stuff. We aren’t saying you have to talk, but being involved with chat, meme posting, etc makes a real difference to the ‘buzz’ in guild. Naturally if you are raiding you will at least be expected to be in voice chat listening to raid leaders during raids.
---
**PvE:**
---
Everyone will be dipping their toes into PvE content regardless of their endgame goals. As you level up you will jump into a dungeon or two and at 60 you will need to gear via dungeons or raids.
---
Our goal is to have a causal raid team comprised primarily of players who’s focus in on clearing PvE content. The team will also involve players looking to try raiding in order to further bolster the raider ranks and ensure everyone has an opportunity to see the latest raid content each phase has to offer.
---
We intend to use a DKP system with (gentle) point decay to ensure as fair a chance as possible regarding 40 man raid loot and Loot Council for tanks. 20 man raid loot will be via a MS/OS rolls system. Raids are planned to be 2 - 3 times a week, from 7pm - 10pm UK (BST).
---
We are currently recruiting all classes and specs to build our level 60 roster up. Whilst we would prefer the dominant specs for each class and their role we also feel that this is not a necessity to clear raids until Phase 4. If you can demonstrate you are skilled and willing to put the work in to get the most out of your desired spec, you have a home here.
---
**PvP:**
---
As previously mentioned, once Phase 2 has a release date we aim to being building a core team of dedicated PvP players for premade BGs. As we progress closer to BGs being released and the honour systems implementation we will further discuss (if required) the need for a PvP team schedule.
---
**Events:**
---
At least once a week I will be assisting guildies with dungeon runs, helping to get sweet loot and quests done. Depending on the level of these dungeons I may just flat out do boost runs. I’m thinking every Saturday to try target when most people will have free time.
---
Weekly / By-weekly Guild Fishing Excursions - Chill music, beers and good times on the Discord as we fish through Azeroth.  
---
Once a month I plan to host a guild ‘Hide and Seek’ event in a randomly chosen zone. Working on the mechanics of how to execute this fairly and prize pool but it should be good fun!
---
**A little history:**
---
Havoc originated back in 2005 on The Maelstrom (Horde) as a hardcore PvP guild, having multiple rank 10+ members as well as a number of High Warlords. &lt;Havoc&gt; were regarded as the best Horde PvP guild on the server and regarded highly in all EU servers overall.
---
Our intention is to emulate this as best as possible given the time restraints of real life, as mentioned previously, a significant portion of our player base are 25+ therefore grinding 12+ hours a day on a weekday is unlikely. Due to the nature of phase content releases we have changed our emphasis to a PvE focus with the goal of providing those with PvP in their hearts a core team to roll premades with.
---
**Special Note:**
---
We are currently on the lookout for raid leaders and class leaders for both PvE and PvP. These players should have experience in playing their class at a high level, with in depth knowledge of talent builds, gear and rotations. Class leaders should be willing to lend a hand to their fellow class players in order to help improve and provide support as needed.
---
What are the hourly rates?
---
I'd say arugal for that int bonus.
---
I was tryhard in vanilla and dinged 55 to 60 within a 5 square meter farm with zombies in plaguelands. Cn't remember exact values from 2005's.
---
Just bank it. There's a lot of travel time for groups at high level anyway, and even then, there's a good chance you're passing a bank on the way.
---
Warlocks are underpopulated on the realm I’m in but somehow my guild is chock full of them (I’m one of them) and like 8 of our 10 highest levels are locks.
---
Also theorycrafted to be used for the Spelladin build so Ret Paladins can do competitive DPS in raid. The farming involved would be mental.
---
the voidwalker hype died because it was all under false information. apparently private servers all buffed the VW. it's not very good in classic.
---
VW is good to around 15, but then it struggles to hold aggro. then I used imp to 20, then succubus. succubus to 60, pretty much. does equal (or more) damage as the imp with a lot more survivability.
---
Man I love having a druid or Paladin dps in a group, because they're always there with off-heals to pull us through mispulls or aggroed patrols.
---
We completed Uldaman, including the level 47 last boss, with a group of 41-43s because the off-heals were on point.
---
Holy, I knew Ashbringer faction balance was good, but this is actually insane.
---
I'm not level 30 yet, so I don't have feigndeath, so I can't comment on that.  
---
But there are many weird things happening with pets.  
---
Like, how they stand on the corpse of target after it died, instead of running back to me.  
---
How they run around like madmen when attacking, instead of standing still.  
---
Also, I played a bit on private server, and on ps the pet run behinds you, but in Classic it runs beside you.  
---
How was it in 2005? It has actually caused some problems in dungeons, where I am running next to a wall to avoid getting aggro, but the pet will run beside me, and get aggro anyways.
---
“If I get attached I usually just die” , this line made my day
---

---
Quick question, do you have to use them from level 1 or can you start using them at any level?
---
"Silent said nothing, as always, he was silent. Meaning he spoke no words or made any sound."
---
🤔😏👌🏻
---
Watch Kargoz warlock guide v3 on YouTube. Also look up Dive’s drain tanking guide.
---
I'm down to about 8-9 cigarettes a day, from over 30 before that. I literally forgot smoking for 5 hours while doing ZF back to back. At this rate I might be a non smoker once I start tanking raids lol.
---
Thank god somone with a brain .
---
Ans then he walked off the bus and everyone clapped .
---
Fuck this sub is gullible.
---
Bravo! For real,  Shadow God of Un'Goro, the Orc-slaying Memelord, The Dad Who Melts Faces will be feared everywhere!
---
You go bro!
---
Wow you math wizard
---
Gehennas and Shazzrah. Others are pretty much dead.
---
Truth
---
either they're running out or getting killed for the free trip back to goldshire (there's no res sickness under lvl 10)
---
I doubt people playing vanilla wants their hans held but I think you are misjudging how many that would grief now compared to back in the days.
---
It's not fun if you literally can't access the AH at all for days because people want to be "the villian". It's the same reason they made a "leash" on Kazzix. Sure it would be fun to see him destroy a major town once, but every day? Not so much.
---
And a spike on his shield!
---
After rightly complaining about all the phone pictures and video, maybe we shouldn't flood the comments of properly captured content with sarcastic complaints about other people's posts
---
I recently started grabbing last hits with mind blast for this reason. Works great.
---
No, as soon as you kill a boss, your character is linked to the instance and can't run another before reset
---
The rogue being discussed is a dick, anyone defending him, is possibly a rogue dick too.  Played a rogue for a long time... years... if you respect your group mates they'll respect you too, he just showed his greed and disrespect.
---
Lol TIL bigots get defensive when called out... /s 
---
Not a Zionist in the slightest though I am Jewish. Big difference.
---
Don't really care what games you play or the culture just thought I'd point out use of a racial slur and tell you you're ignorant. You just proved my point.
---
Because the people clapping for him on the bus told him .

its not like horde have the same issues on some server. if you can't stand getting constantly ganked you might wanna go PvE or RP. If I get ganked, I just move places or call reinforcements.
---
It is normalized and yes it uses the same modifier but weapon damage still effects it, and slower weapons have higher damage.
---
Even post normalization there is more damage from slower weapons on instants. It’s not as crazy as it was pre normalization but it’s still there.
---
Srsly? What Level are you?
---
Are you Horde or alliance?
---
It does seem quite dead if that is the case.
---
Might have just been a bad layer though.
---
Its name is taco bell because it's a fiery ass
---
Most impressive thing is how bad these guys are
---
the mouseover part works, but when i type my buddy's name in [@player] example [@buddy] it does not work
---
My understanding is that chain heal is hugely buffed by having its scripting fixed in classic which was in vanilla but only at the very end.
---
Are you mentally fucked in the head ?
---
You cant even english let alone bullshit your way through this cringe story.
---
Second fear is on DR plus he is taking DoT damage, so would naturally pop early.
---
Yes aware of this. Perhaps I’ll build it into an addon and save having to do it manually. Cheers
---
That would be pretty cool but na.
---
Blizzard counts as a dot, it won't do dmg before the first tick which is 1 sec I think
---
I love the irony of you saying this when this isn't even what you're supposed to do.
---
You open it then. Lockpicking is nowhere near the same thing as providing water and soulstones. If you say it is you never leveled lockpicking. It's more akin to mining and herbalism.
---
or healing feral druids!
---
So the dungeon ends after them, not a problem then, hardly a ninja.
---
They don't even need to bawl in zone chat. Horde outnumber alliance so hard that if you ever pick a fight with a horde you're basically going to attract the attention of most of the usually 10 horde within a 15 metre radius. Hell even if you act in self defence and kill the horde who attacked you you're still going to die there's just too many.
---
I can honestly say if I didn't have time to play late at night I don't even think I'd feasibly be able to level on my server as alliance.
---

It would take 6 months if you don't trade

1 key input does 1 action on each account, no spells are being automated.

Readinf this guys post history the majority of his posts are /r/thathappened .
---
What a sad life to lie to strangers  on the internet for kicka.
---
You don’t put his name in there leave that, you just have to have him selected.
---
I can just imagine the sad sight of a bunch of gamers normalising the word Jew to mean cheap... That stereotype is in fact what lead to Nazism... 
---
Another stupid one is people using raped to describe getting killed. Just goes to show you that people can be childish and ignorant behind a keyboard and monitor.
---
Old memories, guildies helping me to get my mount. Also that questline was epic.
---
I think people mix up. Personally sometimes I feel like cozying up, relaxing to the beautiful in-game soundtrack. And sometimes when I'm more restless I'll turn on a documentary or something on another monitor or listen to Spotify.
---
Which is why I have every right to decide not to heal a party member for their actions in a dungeon.  I charge people with time wasted.
---
I remember this being a thing in TBC where you had shit like Ancient Lichen that only spawned in dungeons, and people would actually roll on the nodes due to how valuable and rare they were. 
---
I couldn't imagine doing it otherwise though, a little bit of tin or iron isn't exactly groundbreaking. Maybe I'd do it for Dark Iron?
---
Is it the Barrens of the alliance?
---
The only time an alliance player has attacked me at full health was when they showed up as a skull level. You boomers always wait till I'm low mana and hp or with adds to help attack. I mean one of you "adults" grave camped me for 3 deaths last night before I decided to call it a night.
---
cringe
---
She was watching me play for a few minutes one day, and she said that fighting monsters looked too fast, but running around picking things up would be fun. I let her customize a toon on my account and play for a few hours, which turned into me going to bed, waking up the next day and realizing she was up all night. She had so many questions! It’s now something fun we get to do together. This story was from about 13 years ago, and we still play together.
---
Ty
---
I hope you can carry on with your day though.
---
But it is true. It is softcore pvp and hardship for horde if you just dungeon door camp and enemy fraction player 10v1. It‘s not bad that it happens. It‘s bad that it always happens.
---
The water totem quest can go to Hell though.
---
What I said is still true. I didn’t say it started in Cata. I forgot it started in Wrath.
---
Tempted to buy some 12 slotters they are like 1.5 but I need to save for mount
---
Need to make 50g in the next 3 levels
---
51, and yes it might have to do with layering.
---
Really? Couldn't have been on all servers. My memory tells me late vanilla(when a stack of copper ore was 2g+) it was around 180g on khaz goroth eu. It might habe been a bit more or less but nowhere near 1k.
---
How? Have you done any extreme farms or ah gaming? Or did you sell a shitload of blunderbusses in Ashenvale?
---
If you're horde on Bloodfang, let me know and I'll introduce you to my friends and guild!
---
Who says I was being sarcastic?
---
Ok, will try soon. Thanks!
---
It would save me alot of time not buffing the group, money on group buffs too.
---
That does not work at all. It will just say “namehere” makes some strange gestures
---
.
---
Maybe he even took offense. "Rank 1 ?! WDYM I dont heal for that little!"
---
Would have taken
---
Haha checks out exactly.
---
Im almost 49, no professions(i plan on leveling those after i hit 60) bought my mount at 40 and learned the skills i needed(not all yet) and im sitting at 105g. 
---
# im a mage
---
Yes 100%
---
U  can play solo just no dungeons it I would never recommend it
---
Need for main spec
---
Like as a warrior leveling arms(2h) and the drop is one handed then u greed
---
If you are tanking it and you are prot spec then need otherwise its kinda 50/50 talk with the dps. Obviously some 1h like dalrend dont suit you.
---
Sure, but it will be very difficult in some areas. You can't just up an join a group- you need to find a group that's going or advertise your group. Some things are almost impossible without a group. 
---
Normal wow is alot more solo friendly
---
Thanks for this!
---
It seems to be working fine and appears in TitanPanel as well.
---
Haha so that is why it feels so stupid to me seeing all these people whining like little bitches about the slightest annoyance.
---
I think you may just be a closeted RP'er lmao
---
Did you see how fast he was :)
---
You'll make friends :)
---
You will definitely have to group up with random people for sure if you want to experience the majority of the content! But you can experience most of the game without joining a guild or talking to people a whole lot. It would be very difficult to do all of the content without being a part of some type of community however. But wow is an open world game and you will have a blast playing solo or playing in groups!
---
A taxi driver refused to use the meter in Seville like 7 years back, even though we (me and my then GF) asked him a couple of times. He said it was fine. But he did the opposite of take a detour; drove straight to our destination super fast, like scarily fast, way over the speed limit at some points. The trip was only about 5 minutes, maybe less (we got lost walking home from dinner, mainly because we didn't bother to get local internet on our phones). Then he asks for 50 euros. Won't hear anything about it. So I ask my GF to go get the hotel concierge, while I wait in the cab. The guy loses his shit abusing me, like goes demented. I offer him 10 euros, he refuses. Concierge gets there, calms the situation, and tells me to give him nothing more than 5 euros. Weird situation, and probably my fault for not point blank insisting we use the meter, but god I love the rise of cheap internet and ride share apps which make most of that dodgy taxi shit a thing of the past no matter where in the world you are.

Rouges are rouges. Without picklock they still throw on table hudge amount of dps. 
---
Helpful? I was helpful for years starting from wotlk (or was it TBC?). What I got as a result? Nothing. Helping others is the waste of time. Being just another dps spot is easy and gets things done.

---
Yes and it’ll be great. Having friends is nice to play with of course, but there is definitely a rich experience to be had when playing solo
---
Wow.. this was so bad it felt like satire. 
---
I hope this is satire
---
It won't work because your expecting people to get to said location in a certain amount of time before it despawns and drops you off yet its going... Super slow. And then a cool down which essentially means you failed to get up now wait till its back up before available again. I'd rather they build structures or just have a flight 2 way flight path up and down a mountain. Your way just wouldn't work.
---
On the higher pop PvP realms there's a weird situation of not being able to wPvP due to the sheer amount of people. I fully intended to kill any horde scum on sight, but it's not really a good idea when there's literally 5+ of them in my screen all the time. If you start a war in those conditions, you're not getting any questing done.
---
if one dps is drinking the rest can just keep pulling
---
It hapenned to me like 3 times to me last night too! Worst part was aggroing everything you passed by.

WTF are you even talking about that's a completely expected and entirely plausible outcome. Have you ever even been to Booty Bay or Ratchet?  Shit like this happens all the time.
---
That’s dirt cheap, each moon cloth on my servers is going for 20-30gold
---
I just upgraded to woolen bags after noticing how cheap they are considering how much more money they would bring in - already feeling like I just leveled up 5 times. On every loot I think "Damn that will be it, inventory full" but no, still looting happily!

---
what dont you understand, Horde globally outnumber alliance, cross realm BGs wont smooth this out
---
Alliance will have pretty much instant queues while you horde sit and wait your turn
---
That's just not true
---
I also have been using it for years now, love it
---
Im on biggles horde id love to know his name
---
PvE mages probably, Int gives extra crit chance and with Evocation they only need so much spirit. As for stamina, for most content a priest buff is sufficient to survive any boss AoE with ease.
---
The moment you go PvP however, it's back to all stamina.
---
i was mocking a Warrior on the run to desolace on my druid. He seemed cool about it, so I threw some entangling roots at his face and strolled away
---
Buffed a rogue 5 minutes later he tried to kill me, so I had a good reason to camp his body for the next hour, it’s a good test to see who’s worth camping.
---
Its still useful to keep rogues from stealthing, so I keep it in a less used bind position, just in case.
---
Alch/herb level 50 warrior and I have enough golds for epic mount and some change.
---
I want to downvote you so hard.
---
I know you're joking but holy hell I can't deal with would of
---
Going back and forth across the Barrens a few times, to Ashenvale, back to the Barrens, to Silverpine and back to the Barrens with no mount isn't an exaggeration. No one will say it's difficult, but two hours running to these places and back can't even be compared to the other quests at this level.
---
Go to zandalar tribe if you like giant world pvp battles
---
You can summon people to that place if you are with 2 people at the stone
---
I abandoned the quest in Southshore because I killed like 10 turtles with no meat. Was later doing 1k needles and just happened upon about 15 meat from doing the quests there. Next time I was in Southshore it was an easy turnin
---
More fun to be Alliance. I'm on Skeram as well never afraid to fight!
---
They allow you to summon partymembers. They are currently not "working" and will be implemented in the next phase :)
---
As far as I’m aware, the Gathermate classic database isn’t available yet. I hope it’s up soon.
---
From everything I've seen, the zygor guide for classic isn't very good. You can see the thread on their own forums about that too.
---
They are literally just a place to meet in Vanilla.
---
Alliance is, sadly, just the objectively worse choice; worse racials, worse flight paths and towns, worse questing... as long as that's so, most people will play horde, especially on PvP realms due to horde OP PvP racials...
---
I’m still doing some barrens quests at 28 lol
---
What? That's really cheap. Mooncloth is going for 20g each on my server.
---
Hell yeah brother.
---
tailoring took me an hour or so to level to 260 once I had all the mats, just use a guide.
---
The bells at the beginning always reminded me Silent Hill.
---
I had -6 spirit on an equipped item; maybe this is what you have too?
---
Yeah, non-natives generally wouldn't do it, we are taught 'would have' (the way it works in many other languages) first, and then the contracted form
---
Like outside dungeons and stuff? 2 people from a party can use them to summon other people in the party to that location. So you can gather all party members to the instance without waiting for them to travel.
---
This was satisfying!
---
Top Kek
---
I have to switch gnomish on for idiot?
---
I play alliance on PvE, so relax. We know that some servers are horde dominated but ehat is the overall number? 45/55? We don't know, hopefully its not too bad. The argument that single servers are stuffed because of their population imbalance will be lessened by ctoss realm BGs.
---
On BoE World-drops everyone should need though. So thats not really ninja.
---
Well it only explains priority but not stat weights as im comparing intellect / mp5 with a whopping 57 healing spell power which is a LOT.
---
Had a nuts ST run, group level was a little low. We had a 1% wipe on the last guy, then like 3 bad wipes. Folks with red gear at this point, but somehow killed it with just the tank alive with 17% health. We also wiped initially by not clearing all the mobs out and got steamrolled. Fun run.
---
yeah he could just want the gear, it's a shield and healing hammer seems pretty good for a paladin
---
LOL. Oh how I don't miss the old fucked up charge paths...XD
---
Eh, you generally just want to stay in berserker stance and pop it when he uses it. If you use it before he fears, he can just wait out the duration and then fear you full.
---
I don't even have kids and I want all that sleep.  I bounced myself out of college playing TBC too much and I don't need much convincing not to want to go back to those days.
---
something a Rogue like me would love to have
---
Yes and no, i played warcraft 3 alot but never got into wow, instead I entered hearthstone and stayed on longer than i had with any other game, so i knew the characters that were in wc3 really well but hs was my introduction to many wow only character as well as the name of dungeons, zones and spells
---
they tell you the name of the dungeon and the recomenden level
---
they will never do more here, not even in other phases
---
in other expansion packs they were used to teleport group members to them, but not in vanilla
---
Not sure why you are being down voted, this is a legitimate comment.
---
This is literally my thoughts all day while playing classic
---
Kill those warthogs in the barrens... why can't I skin them, like you can skin a spider... literally for leather but a warthog is a no no cause it has no clothes on....
---
And my favourite rpg element of all is items not dropping, the friend I play with is the funniest guy alive and we have to get zhevra hooves.. and he's like "oh.. it didn't drop hooves, guess we just killing paraplegic zhevra's shame on us"  
---
Later we in hillsbrad killing peasants, farmers for skulls and he's like "I guess they just completely empty headed XD "
---
Nope not in early versions
---
They had a sort of LFG system in vanilla but you had to go and click in then to go in the queue.
---
They didn’t summon party members until TBC
---
Sounds hectic damn D: I dont mind Horde but i Prefer ally. Feel bad choosing horde then since I'll just be adding to the ratio but also if i choose Ally I'll never get to 60 D:
---
I litteraly rolled a warlock to play with the infernal, even if it's not optimal ; if this is true and isn't fixed in the upcoming days, I will surley stop playing after sinking so much time into leveling a class that won't be able to do what she was intended to do
---
That would almost answer my problem, but it's been doing it since before I started building Demonic Embrace. I remember having this problem back in my early 20s, I remember it being at -3 spirit. I've been speccing in affliction until I hit lvl 40, and now just getting into demonology and demonic embrace.
---
From my experience alliance are like hydras, kill one and a 20 man death squad rolls out of nowhere to delete you.
---
Spy doesnt give u special detection
---
Do they give a bonus or is this just a feels thing?
---
Atleast not in my experience
---
Back in vanilla, these stone had a (pretty useless) auto grouping function, with many flaws. It did literally put just 5 players together. You could easily end up being a group with 5 DDs.
---
This wasn't implemented into classic (since nobody ever used it anyways).
---
Later, with TBC, this was changed to have a summoning function.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Meeting_Stone
---
Right now, they are only... there. No function, except for telling you about which dungeon is here.
---
STV? :)
---
Would of smh, suicidal already and the day hasn't started yet.
---
Fuck. This hit deep
---
Yeah it’s called a Hunter.
---
Pool money with your guildies and *buy that shit **yesterday***. Keep track of the % guildies pooled and repay out that percent when you flip it.
---
No you can't.
---
Hell yeah brother, cheers from Irak.
---
? if I didn't know how to play I wouldn't even notice that when my target dodges my hit the addon is not showing the availability of overpower even that it should show that it was Available, just because I wanna makes thing easier for me doesn't mean that I don't know how to play.
---
Nuuu don't spoil it for me 😅 tis a horse I tell you!
---
the phases wount change them,
---
in the next expansion packs they had more function
---
Much like your dwarven "archaeologists" who commit large-scale murders of tauren tribes to conduct their merciless excavations of ancient holy grounds.
---
Your moral high ground is a sham.
---
Same situation last night, but as a mage I just midair self-cast Slow Fall and enjoy the trip ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I can’t really find any good place to consistently fish wreckages, tho, for it to seem worth it.
---
not in classic or vanilla
---
123456
---
qertfg&lt;yxc
---
shift+123456
---
shift+qertfg&lt;yxc
---
ctrl+qertfg&lt;yxc (I use this for non combat binds. Professions, buffs etc.)
---
Works great for me. It's basically numbers and keybinds around WASD that come with a shift/ctrl modifier.
---
Do the UD zones man, they’re fucking awesome
---
Summoning came with TBC release patch.
---
not in vanilla or classic
---
This reminds me of using the bug in Ultima Online to have guards kill people with magic reflect on if you cast a beneficial spell like bless on them while you were flagged criminal.
---
yes, but there's already a text that shows when a mob dodges, but it can be missed sometimes if too much stuff is happening on screen, the addon makes life easier
---
it's would HAVE
---
You can do so if you wish, although I think it's advisable to group up for Elite quests and, you know, talk to people. Networking and the social aspect is a huge part of the game, and to me, a drastic improvement over the later iterations and expansions of the "retail" game. If you truly want to solo and have no interest at all in talking to people, retail is more accommodating - you can literally form dungeon groups and clear dungeons (and even LFR-level raids) without ever talking or putting in any effort to form groups. 
---
I still think classic has so much more going for it. It is a bit more difficult on several levels, but that just pushes you together with people and encourages you to socialize and make friends. You will also be so much more happy whenever you get a 6 slot bag or a gear upgrade, as in retail you just get that stuff thrown at you. I got a 10 slot bag from a chest yesterday and almost flew through the roof! Doesn't happen in retail, or didn't when I still played it.

Hello all, Priest 28 here. This is not really a priest only related question but here it goes: I've looted several gear pieces with +x healing or +x shadow damage and I was wondering how much is it if the gear piece sais +10 Healing? Is it 10%? is it 10hp per spell? If its more complicated, which I expect it to be, is there a chart for it? When is is viable to switch my +10 spirit gear out for a +10 healing?

Just a small thing - don’t spam tab + 1 you could target some mob you don’t need and waste your instand. Create a target macro /tar [first few letters from the npc name /cast Instand - works like a charm

That's pretty clear to me, at least that's how everyone advertises over on Faerlina.

Wowhead says in a comment that they used beast-lore at 1.8.4:
---
"King Bangalash
---
Level 43 Beast (Elite)
---
107 - 143 Damage
---
2414 Armor
---
5577 Health
---
Diet: Meat, Fish
---
Tameable
---
Tamed Abilities: Dash (rank2). Claw(rank6)"
---
If you feel he is nerfed, if you beast lore him now will it be different?
---
also the queue function was removed again before 1.12 was released
---
I know I’m an addict because I’m stuck working 14 hour days and every day I’m thinking, ‘when will this shit end so I can go home and play wow’
---
I quested to 60 and only did dungeon runs once for quest excluding about 1.5 levels of zf spam. Still had half of epl, some winter spring, all of silk this, and a good amount of the long zone to zone chains left.
---
Honestly there might have been a pet overhaul towards the later part of vanilla.  So if your 1st hunter did those things early in vanilla your experience may vary due to that.  Hunter pets do have some insane armor.
---
Wow guess they were an added function in BC. I did not know that. I started in wrath. So I guess they are currently just decorative lol
---
I leveled it 14 years ago, then a few other times.  It's easy as hell to level, and not some soul crushing exploit.  It takes a lil time, sure, but if you are smart and take 10min here and 10 min there as you level, and plan your time accordingly, it's nothing, it's just part of your class, a skill.  I've never paid for a rogues skills and I never will.  I'll also never charge to help someone with a lockbox.  I see it as petty greed, and a personality trait of the selfish.
---
You mean you can farm 2 bigglesbucks killing mobs in salt flats in like 10 minutes ;)
---
U can do equip sword on the SS macro
---
Repeat 1 million times and you have gold for your mount (before reputation)!
---
I just wonder what must be happening in he office seeing how classic was a huge success
---
As a rogue u gonna be KOS anyway
---
Spirit Tap.
---
30s to rez you
---
I just googled it. There are so many things I'm so used to that I'm not even really sure what all classic has haha
---
Yeah that’s incorrect.
---
Relapse
---
😉
---
What's this a reference too?
---
Definitely not by pointing phone at the screen.
---
Oh really? That’s all they did in vanilla?
---
There is a dark side of the moon.
---
This likely doesn't address you actual question but in case it's relevant...
---
MP5 is/was pretty much the most valuable stat you could get as a beginning resto shaman going into raids. Because the DPS is also low-gear still, and the tanks don't produce as much threat, the fights drag on much longer. The main problem resto shamans had in early Vanilla was going OOM. Later on you could diversify, but at first the theory went that it doesn't matter how powerful your heals are when you can't last through the final minutes of the fight. I'm just finding out tonight that apparently there are a lot of changes/buffs that I wasn't expecting to be in Classic so early so this could be bad information at this point. Sorry if its completely off-topic.
---
How's the mana for 1v1 encounters? Can I burst someone before going oom?
---
Sorry my bad then! Been awhile since I played.
---
they se xxx " is doing some strange gesture " or something along those lines

---
Any word on release date yet?
---
Saw someone doing this a week ago, forgot it was a thing and blew my mind and wasted about an hour of my time trying to remember how to do it
---
This reminded me and hopefully someone can find it. I watched an elemental shaman PvP montage years ago when I was playing WotLK that had clips in here and the background song was There's no sympathy for the dead by Escape the Fate.
---
True, but I have not seen it shown much in lore so people might be skeptical or unwilling to accept it though likely.
---
Try Tidyplates
---
Wouldve loved to recieve something like this. „I tip you next time“ is what i got.
---
So would you say it's a twink item mainly? or a leveling item?
---
People that buy these are honestly doing everyone else a huge service. Then maybe AH stuff will finally have value.
---
Alliance outnumber horde on herod, but not by much. It's actually pretty equal as far as high pop realms go
---
It came in with the dire maul patch. We aren’t at that part yet.
---
same thing for horde tho in some places, Ashenvale for example. that wasnt fun to quest in..
---
The 2nd rank will see them as will the 3rd.  I don't think the first works.
---
They could have 3x as many and the alliance would still win AV! For the light!
---
Looks like hord outnumber alliance on most servers
---
RIPPPPP =((
---
You know why they need the candle? There is a monster deep in their cave and without the candle light, that monster can get them.
---
Honestly im disappointed in dungeon runs atm, as a warrior dps its pretty much impossible to find a group hello
---
That might actually be what I had. Thank you! All this time I thought my character was bugged or something
---
Gathering momentum.
---
Super Legit LLLOLed out loud
---
And with no response it runs away while trying to act dismissive.
---
Diablo mobile likely won't be out before blizzcon. They'll want to smooth things over first by announcing diablo 4, then mention that btw immortal is out NOW for us to play in the meantime.
---
My low judgement realm hit medium last night
---
Usually it only hit medium on sunday nights
---
Did he survive the fight? xD
---
&gt;clearly
---
but... `'ve` and unstressed `of` are both pronounced /əv/.
---
This is literally just a spelling mistake.
---
How are they going to balance servers when alliance are outnumbered by a lot overall? Lets say you got 10 servers, 100k horde, and 50k alliance. You could at most balance 5 of those servers... the others would be horribly unbalanced.
---
It totally triggers me and I scrolled down just to find this thread. :)
---
Basic grammar. Me no understand. ;)
---
Loved this, god dad. *Melt his face! Melt his face! Melt his face!*

Great answer

Ouch, too real them taunt res

OR like I have been bitterly experiencing, entire guilds showing up once every 3 hours so the guildmaster can farm.

This was just on the front page earlier today. I mean god damn. Are you that hard up for karma you had to repost something that was on the front page 8 hours earlier?
---
Gnomer is the true endgame
---
Personal favorite of mine is " ž 1 ä 2 3 1 p ‡ Ä 1 Ä ". When said as Alliance, horde read "l o v e y o u r m o m"
---
That's quite unsettling.. WoW could easily play out as a Dark fantasy horror story played from the perspective of a human lv 1 peasant.
---
na man, it's pretty rough... questing is proving quite difficult at 45+ lol, more to kill at 60 though, all good!
---
With BGs it's certainly a great staff for 49 BGs. But it will also do good in early raids until you've saved enough DKP to get a really neat drop. There may be other options from Strat/Scholo/BRS that are just as good but definitely not as stylish.
---
Oh, it's not as bad in classic btw, there's more debuff slots for instance so barman is better.
---
You need sub talents tho
---
Like random moddeling experiments by the trainee.
---
&gt; If I get attacked I usually just die
---
I feel this in my soul
---
Fearward is stupid op tho
---
Awesome, will upload my stats
---
I have blacklisted maybe 3 players so far in 3 days played for crap similar to that.  Have to do stuff like that sometimes
---
Take a screenshot for proof and post it into the server discord. Actually happened on our server with a more valuable BOE epic and the guy who ninjaed it actually ended up splitting the gold with the group after he realized how important reputation is in Classic. Someone from the group posted a screenshot and a background story, not sure if it's still there but the server is Noggenfogger.
---
This is why I won't pug.. Lol
---
I don't get the hate about lfr, it is designed for casuals to see the story, that's it. No actual raider is actually doing lfr, gear in it is garbage. So why are raiders outraged that casuals who wouldnt even get into a raid are able to experience the story?
---
he seemed young i doubt he's already 40

No, Mc, ubrs, scholo, and strat were all nerfed by 1.12. The hard dungeons you remember are from previous patches

Cus I found nice guild and they started on pvp server

You're short for would've.

Can you buy boxes in AH?

Lol you farmed Corpsemaker with me and my friends Kimpan at lvl 29. You really got ahead of us. Nice to see the server is progressing. What did Rag drop and who MT'ed?

Its wrongen
---
Yeah, disc is probably more fun in AV, specially if you usually play healer anyway :)
---
Because most of the time pvp while leveling is just a time sink
---
Bingo. Here we go boys
---
You could make milking machine in engineering so you could just suck it on the go
---
Fat stats
---
You lack the mental capacity to realize that this is not a bug.
---
I got my account back, so  it seems i did not buy gold.
---
There's not really that much to compare this to. The whelplings will probably sell for more than they currently do down the line though. I've picked up a couple for less than 20g.  Black tabby is another good one. The only one I would compare to Hyacinth Macaw would be the Disgusting Oozeling. but it's fairly unlikely someone will drop that on the AH for cheap.
---
I grinded that weapon yday all day. The dmg increase was not worth it.
---
This was such an inspiring story. With 15 years of experience apparently comes the ability to actually work together in some cases.
---
What? While leveling, everybody upgrades whenever there is an upgrade available.
---
a level 58 skill that requires a drop and then doing a pretty long quest with a end quest that you need a group to do inorder to get yeah i would be salty aswell if i went and did all of that and not be able to cause some chaos.
---
Same.
---
Dude loot your mobs
---
Yesterday it was pretty hectic in Zul´kunda, everybody doing them Bloodscalp ears (fking low drop chance). You enter there and you see only red nameplates - NPCs+Players.. Like literally 30 horde there. We managed to kill like 25 hordes there, one by one, sometimes a bunch of people together :D We were only 3-4 allys entering there, but cooperating together, not even in party... then it was quiet for a while, we were farming OUR mobs, in OUR territory... and then we saw 15 horde coming at us, but at that time , I had my quest completed and dude it was fun af :D Well at least it was OUR teritory for like 15 minutes :D
---
Zandalar tribe. Eu rppvp. Super friendly. Lots of mature players
---
bruh, its a different quest. I did Gnomish quest. Goblin is completely different. both not available.
---
Ive just gotten my ban overturned
---
!remindme 2 days
---
I got money for better bags like 12 or 14 slots but they seem really overpriced cuz there arent many people lv 40-50 to supply more on my younger realm
---
4x onyxia hide bags or bust
---
It's only ashenvale and silverpine once though?!? And I was questing in staonetalon at the time so I had the flight point there and the flight point in silverpine but to be honest the point there in silverpine is a bit too low ;-; unless I'm not remembering a step lol also we had ghost wolf by then no? Or was water totem before 20. I can't even remember now :(
---
Cringe compilation of windfury procs/crits. Nothing pvp or skill related in the video.
---
Feels like a "pvp" video from 2005, just higher resolution.
---
## bruh 😡😤🤡🤡🤡
---
i'm sorry but this game never had dark souls tier difficulty
---
I guess it's because of layering. When removed med-high servers will have long queues. I guess low-medium is what they want?
---
I almost exclusively use game sound/music. Only exception is during wow grinding, during which i occasionally listen to podcasts. But most of the time I just grind to game sound/music. I couldn't listen to some random music though, that would pull me right out off the world. For the same reason I can't watch streamers blaring random unfitting music. Hell, I can't even stand kibblers hearthstone videos on youtube because it doesn't use hearthstone music (I know why he does it, but I'd prefer game music laid over the cut down video).
---
Game music is super important to me. I also listened to the factorio music for hundreds of hours while playing. Couldn't imagine anything else.
---
/r/nothinghappens
---
You cannot tried just incase. No options
---
Where do you vendor as ally tho
---
The area is horde
---
You can also Shift + Click on your ability and remove the "(rank X)" to not make any mistake.
---
Yeah in my armory run I had done I think 54 000 healing and 3000 overhealing. But that makes me pray every time that tank doesn't freak out that I let him drop to 40% before healing (in case I crit).
---
Ahem... Whats wrong with blizzard's bars? If you simply want more bars you can add them in interface options.
---
I’d expect a huge disbelief at first, slowly changing to acknowledging the fact that people like it by heart and realization they have to support both versions from now on. Because whatever they had planned for classic might have to be thrown to a recycle bin and started from scratch. 
---
It’s funny how WoW Classic history repeats. While back there was a video with Jeff and other Vanilla devs about how WoW blew out all expectations and they weren’t prepared to the success it had. And now they are back to the same realization, that original game while having its own issues was the most successful version of itself, confirmed by Classic start. 
---
I hope that whatever they would want to do with Classic+ will be based on 15 years of experience in MMO and WoW because it’s very rare example where one can start from very beginning. I’ve heard that Runescape has used its chance, I believe WoW can do even better. It’s like being a 45 years old and getting back to 10 but keeping all the knowledge and memories and experience.
---
Can we please stop posting shit like that?
---
It was a breeze for me to play on my Alliance toon as we always heavily outnumbered the Horde in contested zones. 
---
Guess what? Every server has a different experience and generalizing the Horde as "Weaker" or saying that they do not know how it feels like to play on a PVP Server is just plain stupidity.
---
My Horde toon on the other hand cant progress in STV currently as I am heavily farmed the moment I leave Grom Gol.
---
And if you are going to bring War Mode and Retail into this: the People on my server (Before I jumped to Classic) only activated their (boosted) war mode when the daily missions pop up over at the Horde zones and then they gather in huge groups and do them together before disabling the mode again.
---
You can hardly blame the Horde players for the lack of Alliance Players that only activate the Mode when it suits them.
---
4 of onyxia ones are still more showboaty tho
---
Disarm is a one minute cooldown and far more effective, retaliation is a 30 minute CD. A warrior who pops retaliation for pvp is probably not very good, it's on too long of a CD to be considered consistently useful. 
---
The beauty of classic is that people love classes for different reasons, and "what is better" is infinitely debatable.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
That's crazy. Time to make all my alts tailors :)
---
He probably meant Lordaeron.
---
Why did you start playing on a PvP realm in the first place if you don't like getting attacked while questing.
---
The 300 riding skill is the part that impressed me the most
---
Just to be sure.. you do have 200 engineering?
---
A hunter dropped a freeze trap right in front of me in BB the other day, i walked right into it and the guards weren’t triggered.
---
Not saying this story is fake but in my own experience a hunter trap doesn’t trigger the guards, maybe something was different in my situation
---
Yea there is a 1 second window from the stealth cue to actually being invis as a rogue and you can catch them with a mark everytime its actually broken
---
Are you horde or alliance? If your alliance I have a priest who should be up in that level range in a bit, she's currently only level 15 but she'll get there
---
Im lvl 21 and just got my first green shouldersfrom a rare spawn in ashenvale. I was doing quest around and saw mob there. Somehoh managed to solo it (just got my cat form) snd got green shoulder ahahaha feels good man
---
That's probably the best way to do it. Get multiple people with tailoring and stack that cd like crazy
---
I was agreeing with you
---
I enjoyed reading this and I'm an orc warrior.
---
I remember when in the open Beta I played my first character, a troll Mage, and almost died to a pig on the very first quest - but hey, you play more and you improve! But soloing in this game can certainly be difficult at times.
---
I find the best way to find a guild is in dungeon runs, if you play OK and/or find someone who you think is nice or plays well and they're a member of the guild, that could be one to try and join. Do a /who &lt;insert guild name here&gt; to see if they have lots of people around your level, and ask a bit about the guild and whether they might be up for recruiting more. As long as you've played somewhat OK and not wiped the group several times you're apt to get an invite - and if the two of you get along and you still don't get an invite, tell him you had a good time and would be happy to tag along for another dungeon or quest at some point and add them to Friends. 
---
Rinse and repeat :) good luck out there!
---
Wait, alliance don't have zeppelins?
---
Default.
---
i'm alliance on a 57/47 horde/alliance server and i'm downvoting you, don't assume :)
---
Just bought one for 20g and feel quite happy about it on Rattlegore.
---
+healing means you can downrank your spells and spend less Mana.
---
Yeah I feel like ideally only use max rank Heal on tank, max rank -1 heal on dps or just renew them  when they are not in immediate danger. Right?
---
Haha same here on exactly lvl 38
---
Doing cath as well; see a herb, ask if there is another herbalist, one guys says yes. I proceed to /roll, he proceeds to run to the herb between the mobs to get it first. I blink in, ninja the herb before him, he gets frustrated, curses and leaves.
---
Rng vs on demand use
---
Are you trolling?
---
I think one of the problems is that people complain no matter what. 
---
With the older design, the most efficient way to quest was to do circles of the map and then return to the quest hub before going back out again with all of your new stages of the same quests and doing it again.   
---
This definitely leads to players feeling that the quest stories aren't cohesive because you're simultaneously doing everything so there isn't a sense of urgency or that the world is waiting for the player (which is kind fo one of your points).  
---
I think we're now at a polar opposite to that design where you enter a zone and go on an extremely linear path to complete the zones story. There are a handful of optional quests but they don't have a huge amount of flavour and they're normally quite short.   
---
It's difficult because sometimes meeting in the middle is a good compromise and other times it devalues the extremes. I think a compromise in the case of quest design isn't really possible. If you go for the middle ground, what you end up with is players who have to keep coming back to the quest hub after each story arc, when from their perspective it's frustrating because it isn't efficient.
---
lul. Golemagg with its longest queue is for sure dead. Try hardmode leveling alliance there, I dare you.
---
\^\^ priests are making me regret not going Undead this time, the CD on psychic scream is so broken.
---
What addon are you using for the name plates above the mob?
---
I think this is the truth.
---
One of the few disappointing things about Classic for me is how much they delivered it as the late-Vanilla and not the actual stuff we had to work through. They shoulda left it as-is and gave us the same nerf-bat later if we still needed it IMO.
---
Things I refuse to believe arethat people "were bad" or "didn't know" or "didn't math it". This is completely untrue. The theorycrafting back then was way more prevalent than it is now I think. True or not, there were definitely big brains figuring things out and sharing it for everyone. None of this game knowledge was a secret to us.
---
The one thing I can think of that might be (someone else mentioned it), is that we brought a lot of dead weight for no reason. The social aspect of the game was a lot more inclusive even among the top guilds on most servers. My guild in Vanilla was a top 3 on Archimonde and they knew their shit and were serious, but for some reason we just kept bringing those last 10 people who didn't really bring much. Late in the game we started running MC with much less people and it seemed to work better.
---
I'm reluctant to rake over the coals of a 13 year old forum argument, but the evidence of my own experience of how different my "end game" experience was between Vanilla (never progressed beyond UBRS, got bored, leveled another character to 60, got bored again) and TBC (smooth progression from 5 man through heroics, then Kara) was incomparable.  If Blizz decide they want to actually make classic something other than a museum, it would be interesting to see what they could achieve if they brought the original TBC heroic concept to vanilla dungeons, and re-worked Kara as a 10-man level 60.  I never had a problem that more committed players got further than me.  The problem I had was by gating the content behind "can you get 40 people together" rather than "are you good at playing the game" made for a very poor experience for players who were skilled but time-poor.
---
True but then again nobody is going to have those until at least 2 weeks from now since ony only drops one each time IIRC?
---
And then you have to somehow convince your guild that the extra bag space is so important for you...
---
how about you ask to join one of the groups?
---
Resurrecting players isn't needed to complete the dungeon either, they can hoof it back. Healing DPS that pull aggro isn't needed to complete a dungeon, they can wait for tank threat. Conjuring food/water isn't needed to complete the dungeon, they can buy their supplies in town. It's a shitty, selfish argument. If you don't want to pay as a team, don't join a party. Solo run the dungeon and stealth to the chest if you don't want to share.
---
True rogues opens it, checks the loot and if its anything good then takes it. If its shit then roll ;)
---
Devilsaur pieces
---
Why are u stocking them gems :D
---
In other games I've played, I am really completionist, but here, I feel like it is rough to do all quests, specially since you outlevel some of them sometimes, that they become irrelevant to do.  
---
I am playing wow for it's lore, I would like to play high level, but after I did have fun while leveling. I enjoy it, I just hate, walking back and forth for a quest from town to town haha
---
Got the ban overturned, i guess maybe there was reason to trust me, as i was innocent.
---
same problem here.
---
The guides that were included originally were just imported versions of their guides from Vanilla.
---
They've just released the "Efficiency" version which, so far, seems a lot better.
---
Hi, does that guide takes me through all dungeons ? 
---
Or does it skip some of them ?
---
I mean it's been 15 years since I've dealt with it so maybe my memory is foggy but seems to me any perceived aggressive action triggered the guards.  Could be wrong though.
---
Got my ban overturned, we are back online!
---
Trust me man, plenty of guilds will have people worse than you
---
I thought that was the point the post.
---
Well i was mostly focusing on the additional armor aspect of it.
---
24 undead rogue checking in here.  The level 30 NE hunter that "ganked" me and died as I was killing Syndicate in hillsbrad yesterday on Sulfuras can straight up suck it.
---
Or you can start clearing the dungeon while people hoof it and get a bigger share of the loot
---
this has my values form old ago!!! Staple numbers of the times
---
Everything has been normalized EXCEPT ATTACK SPEED. Some rare spawns have higher attack speeds therefore are better.
---
But did you get all your parts!
---
Silithus isn’t in the game questwise. Doing each dungeon once would cover a fair bit of the shortfall 👍
---
You need to go to the house in northeast Tanaris and click on the book inside
---
 I see, I can't attest to that as I haven't tried this new version.
---
I personally feel simply using guidelime plus a player guide for a specific class was much better than their previous offering. (and free) 
---
However the new one might be much better,
---
Half of the quests are extremly shitty to do as group due to quest items only droping for one player at a time.
---
Rip repair bills
---
In my experience horde helps out more than alliance. I main horde and even if its a skull ganking i will still throw my comrades some heals even if its just to make the skull have to chase him around longer
---
Would've*
---
Since he attempted to use the abreviated form
---
As a rogue I don't think I don't expect to roll on these kind of things in dungeons if I don't have the gathering profession so I don't expect to share the loot of the locked chest if you can't open it as well.
---
Rogues bring literally no utility to a party, open the god damned chest and be glad people are inviting you to runs.
---
Use the mp5 one because the +healing one is broken
---
Even on retail you have to stand still and lay there for a second before it drops combat, feels really clunky. I remember it being completely instant. I found myself often feigning death but instantly moving afterwards but never dropping aggro in the process. Maybe they ported that code to Classic?
---
The last phase of the quest , leads you to the Hidden Path, to talk with the Earth Elemental.
---
Maybe Firebreather from ST?

Firebreather

Chance on hit: Hurls a fiery ball that causes 70 Fire damage and an additional 9 damage over 6 sec.

That or maybe a green "Rune Sword of...." not ideal, but better than vanquisher's or sword of omen.
---
What's the AH add on OP? Been needing one lately
---
Man I want to play a priest alone for the reason Mind Control exists
---
HOOF HEARTED HOOF HEARTED.
---
Farm some drakes in blasted lands, good loot, and flame sacs for ah, and some silver and skinning.... Or go gill cats in stv, good condor trash and skin
---
Posts that get platinum and silver bother me. Where’s the middle class fella?
---
That's what I thought! 
---
What I got instead was tons of casually racist imbeciles.
---
Or roll and if the winner can't open it nobody gets the loot.
---
Blowme*
---
Been using action faster
---
Im a priest and I try to buff every player i pass by, but especially warriors since i Know how hard it can be to solo as One. In return i get a Lot of help with quests from random ppl. I have never experienced this mentally in any mmorpg Before.

You are a meme yourself xD
---
Standing face against the stairs. No visible trousers and a bag full of gems xD

Perv!

I hate to break it to you but that warr vould have instantly btoken the fear if he knew what he was doing
---
dat you heeling?
---
Yeh, it is kinda shitty. Maybe you can make the best out of it and just grind enemies that drop stuff you need for crafting. I just grinded some animals for meat + leather to level crafts.
---
Awesome story
---
The reason most casters are oom all the time is because they think trying to Aoe everything is faster then single target a specific order with CC included.
---
I've had a better time with tanking dungeons when people are 58-59 and doing dungeons then with people (mostly mages) that are 60. I've completed the 45min baron run in 41min with 3 people that weren't 60 yet, by everyone agreeing on the game plan of CC and the kill order..
---
Also all dps should know if they want to go faster, stop multidotting and breaking CC 24/7 and stick to the plan. That way the tank takes less damage, the healer doesn't need to use as much mana, and the dps can go berzerk with dps.
---
Sidenote: my comment is not specifically aimed at you, but an issue I face with many people trying to dps and do dungeons faster. If people only knew that all classic dungeons were not streamlined for 20min runs, but can easily take up to 2 hours and sometimes more..

I haven't had a queue on Rattlegore since the first few days, curious that we have the option to transfer.

Yeah, I was sleepy, blind, and not very smart.

My bad.

Perhaps he's thinking of frost trap?  Frost trap would aggro the guards I think.  I know that's what I was thinking of when I read the story too until your comment made me think harder.

Yeah, noggenfogger elixir is the shit. I'm waiting for it and my mount to explore some old, weird places...

Theres still a few quests there. I skipped sfk (no quests, long run) and uldaman (just kinda out leveled it without trying) and on my brd run at 58 I didn’t have any of the quests.
---
Not sure if it's running for classic. But you can go on a website called theundermindjournel and that has prices updated every 50-60 minutes. 
---
As I said I haven't checked for classic servers. But maybe worth looking.
---
Bartender
---
Even as a full time alliance player, this was so fun to wach and I cheered for you - haha. Good job buddy :D
---
It's just not a big deal to be honest, it's not mythic 15 nobody is getting 1 shot by pulling threat on a single mob. I tell people as the healer to just go for it and I'll speak up if the party damage gets out of hand but in up until maybe Maraudon Golems nothing hits hard enough to bother with perfect pulling. I'd rather people squeeze out extra damage and I'll make sure to drink as soon as combat breaks and I'll get the heal in when the tank hits 20% and my mana is back above 60%.
---
Disappointing af compared to pfui . I had to use separate add-ons to compensate formissig elements (not seeing debuffs or timers or people's level in tooltip was hugely shit).
---
Half elvui and bartender
---
Levelling off grinding will help a fair bit as well. Find enemies that spawn quick and have decent drops. I try to aim for enemies that are at, or above my level by 1, and stay there until im 2 levels above them. Keeps the xp high and make gold from skinning amd vendoring. If you find a place with mining nodes around then even better
---
What? You are unable to actually gather the stuff but you demand it anyways? Isn't that kind of ... dumb?

I wrote a short response.

Exactly only thing I want to pay for sometimes are portals

This also a memorial for [Ted Whitney](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Ted_Whitney). He was the original voice actor for Terenas in WC3 (where he also did the famous cinematic), but he passed away shortly after the production.

The game has only been out for like 15 days... holy shit
---
Look up, there is a treetop blocking the rain.
---
Man, why can't I get just 1 warrior tryna gank me. Every time I've been killed while questing it has always been by a full, or damn near full, party of alliance rolling around a zone that they're 10 levels too high for.
---
There are two quests as part of chains

Btw if you made 60 - grats on 60!!!!!!!!!! :)

May you always find water and shade.

Man, i Had that thing drop from some undeads in Western plaguelands Back in the day on my rogue. This was magical. 
---
I`ll never forget it.

Imp is amazing. Use Voidy sparingly, mostly for certain pvp builds.
---
225
---
I do all of the above and all I can say is that you are welcome!
---
Well, that's your loss, isn't it? The whole party contributed to your ability to open the chest unmolested, as these chests are frequently surrounded by enemies. Without that, your lockpicking skill is moot.
---
Soloing can be - at times - quite difficult depending on your class. On that note what class are you and on what side are you playing? I've only ever played Vanilla and had a questing mate to go from 1 to 60. I've also leveled another alt to 60 solo back then because I had time to spare.
---
In Classic I don't have a buddy this time around but I've gotten used to a couple of things. Take it slowly, no one is forcing you to go fast. Take your time, and also always look at the quest colours when soloing. A few tips that I've adhered to:
---
- generally ( non-elite ) green quests should always be able to be done when your skills are leveled to what is available
---
- yellow can be daunting if you have a lot of enemy spawns close to each other. If that's the case try to pull only one mob at a time and kill it. Before you pull the next mob, if necessary, wait a bit and let health / mana regen or eat / drink depending on your class
---
- keep an eye on "General" chat for groups that are going on which you can benefit from ( elite quests or kill quests most of the time ) and just be polite when asking to join
---
- take your time and evaluate your equipment if it needs some upgrades especially for physical ranged or melee dependent classes
---
- switching to level equivalent zones is recommended since you'll need all the experience you can get to level up and stay ahead of the curve ( e.g. from Darkshore to Westfall or Loch Modan )
---
- dungeon groups are announced fairly frequently and are worth the investment so look in "General" chat for groups that go to them
---
If you ever need help with something, I'm also on Nethergarde Keep on Alliance side add Shaldrissa.

According to Soyoen's spreadsheet (which is mostly based on private servers data) Vanquisher's Sword is better than Sword of Omen as an offhand weapon. I didn't check the spreadsheet until I replaced the offhand with Mirah's Song so I used Sword of Omen because of the faster speed and higher poison application.
---
I was level 27 in hillsbrad, undead priest. I get jumped by a 32 warrior and mage while I’m fighting a mob. I psychic scream and start running, usually this is enough to stop a gank as you can get great distance from the gankers. Mage proceeds to continue running at me, blinking every cd, warrior is charging any mobs he can to close the gap. I’m just running trying to heal with renew, I can’t stop or they’ll catch me. They literally chased me from one side of hillsbrad to the other. I get to a dead end, turn and fight. They want it, they got it. All in on the mage, swp, devouring plague, holy fire, wand. I have shield and renew up tear the mage into pieces, he’s got no blink cos the scrub thinks he can blow his cds just to chase me down. As the mage dies I scream the warror, he resists and kills me. I don’t care tho,  2v1 against both 5 lvls higher and still kill the mage. Nubshit alliance :). Killed that mage later when he was alone too, feels amazing man.
---
was on a private server?
---
I have the same problem lol
---
Havent made my dorf yet cuz it looks bad with the head piece
---
So I think he gonna be bald. Its the only option.
---
I of a stroke
---
Sorry but I can't agree with the "if the rogue doesn't open it the group wouldn't even see the content" statement. You could also say if the group weren't there, the rogue couldn't even get to the chest ... 
---
I would just let roll everyone unless he is a rogue or not. And btw, loot greed is something terrible.. as long there is nothing in like Teebus, come on who cares?
---
Skinning is one of the easier ways to get the gold needed in time as it kinda happens without going out of your way of doing things. You also get more and more rewards from quests as you get closer to 40, so even if you don't quite have it at 40, you'll likely have it by 42ish at least just from saving and questing.
---
I use bartender with a few other addons to make the UI more clean overall.

Tholdrin Bogbeard is a dwarf Hunter from the wetlands who aspires to be like his hero hemit nesingwary. The bogbeards are a family of dwarves (played by me and 5 of my IRL friends) that have a reputation for bitterness and frivolous use of dwarvish law for personal gain, as evidenced with their current dispute over their claimed ownership of the thandol span. Tholdrin mostly stays away from the politics and has been hunting and fishing in loch modan to prepare for his planned lifelong dream Safari in stranglethorn. Him and his bear Ubbe live on a diet of mostly bristle whisker catfish and Rhapsody malts.

Well, it's a thing. But it's more of a bonus you can give someone when you're happy with the service, rather than something you "have to" give.
---
Either join up or do some farm while you wait.
---
If it takes to long, then skip it and maybe come back the day after.
---
I mean, I literally said I'd sell the mining rights to someone who could mine the node.
---
I don't that restriction exists in classic
---
Thank you for being nice, it really can make someone's day (: the fort buff is amazing

Haha, I am the kind of guy that can be distracted by anything like that. I make friends easily and sometimes we just sit there and chat haha.
---
Thank you for being nice (:

Drives us natives up the fucking wall too.

Very RP indeed,  “SnailDaddy”! /s

Got 3 in my life. This 1h mace with Ice in the name dropped in Maraudon and I equipped it directly on my enhancement shaman, felt awesome. Also got the whelp sword on some rogue, also wore it.
---
But the best was the first, Int buff staff at the end of Scholo, wore it on my priest until BC (yeh I raided casually and never got better).
---
Get the addon "Spy Classic", it keeps a list of all members of the opposing faction that you've encountered and allows you to add them to a "kill on sight" list and specify a reason.
---
It's also just really great for being aware of which enemies are around you.
---
Yeah, there is [Classic Threatmeter](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25165-ClassicThreatMeter.html) but also (i dont use that one yet) Omen.

2-3 but yeah absolutely. Best investment ever

Mostly what the other guys said but also we’ve been playing retail for 15 years. Boss mechanics and mythic this and that are so much more complex than anything in Vanilla it’s silly. We’ve basically been doing the Iron Man Race in retail and WoW Classic is a 40 years dash.

---
\*\*Introduction\*\*
---
We are an RP-friendly (but not required) Guild intended for graveyard hour workers, night owls, and Pacific Ocean residents. We already have a number of Australian, Japanese, and Hawaiian members. If you play primarily in the US PST time-zone's mornings and nights, the &lt;Grave Diggers&gt; is for you! We don't have much in the way of plans just yet aside from making a group of people with similarly aligned schedules, but perhaps some months down the line when people start hitting 60 we'll begin arranging some tentative early morning raiding and such!
---
\*\*Member Expectations\*\*
---
Guild members are not expected to roleplay, but they are expected to not hastle or harass roleplayers that decide to roleplay. They are to be respectful of others, helpful to others, and present themselves to other players in a good light. They need to follow proper dungeon etiquette, including rolling for chests and not ninja looting.
---
\*\*Visions\*\*
---
To make great strides while our competition is literally sleeping. To bury our enemies in tidy and well-made graves. To provide a social group for people who would normally be doomed to play alone at night.
---
\*\*Visions - Phases 2+\*\*

As the guilds of the daytime dwindle away in future phases, we want to endure and grow as only the nocturnal can.

This is war not some honour bound duel the warrior lost but he tried to take advantage of a situation that in all honesty no one would pass up regardless of faction.
---
If you feel the need to start a fight with someone that's already at a disadvantage then you're a coward at heart
---
Delete your warrior and play a paladin, it'll suit your playstyle
---
i'd disagree. Sword of omen is faster speed, basically same dps (0.4 difference) and has great stats. The attackspeed diff will proc more poison, thus more dps. I believe the stats from Swod of omen is better than the attackpower from vanquisher, but i might be wrong
---
I had a priest in gnomer roll need on manual crowd pummeler. Im an arms warrior. Also later in the same group our rogue rolled need on the acidic walkers which is clothy gear. His excuse was i was needing for my friend/roommate. Didnt realise it was bop and not boe.

The amount of people defending this shitty behavior is exactly one of the reasons I find Classic community way different from the community we had back then. I don't remember there even being public arguments about this back in the day. People knew it was fair to just lockpick it and let the winner have it. The community has changed and is much closer to retail than we think, because people have changed along the years.

I sat in org and fished and got chatting to some people. It's a real nice chill thing to do if you're a bit exhausted from quests

Can you really? Someone told me it didn't work.

oh right, that's why.. been trying to help people so many times and got fucked by not being able to polymorph the extra mobs they accidentally pulled

I try to buff everyone as a druid,  and heal everyone who needs heal around me

Working as intended because in the cinematic after the infernal behind the lock stands up, he lasts 5 seconds before despawning

---
If i was a hunter i would bind pet attack to mousewheel uo and pet follow to mousewheel down
---
No. Lockpicking is just another utility, it's part of their role in the group. If any rogue tried to pull that they'd get booted and shamed in LFG in an instant to make sure people avoid grouping with them in the future.
---
Druis:
---
You can't talk while on this form
---
Also druid while in bear form: Not enough rage
---
So that was a lie
---
Yes it does. But its still not good enough to outweigh mp5. Shamans went OOM even while downranking, which I mentioned.
---
I agree, come play Horde on Zandalar Tribe.
---
Is it really that good for money? As a feral druid, killing them is much slower because they're immune to bleed and feral faerie fire etc.
---
30s is the fee for that item tho :D
---
how bout u stop whining, turn ur sleep schedule around and play at night?

or simply just grind mobs. Dude wow is amazing, so many alternatives.

Bartender to reposition and rebind all the bars to be more compact and take up less space. Than add any other addon for extra graphics/layout.

Breathtaking

Lol ive said this so many times, no one has reacted yet sadly

If no one needs it you're ok. If someone actually needs it you're an asshole.

Can you really change layers manually? I thought you needed an invite.

My realm has had a few people like that already. They get called out and collectively ignored and blacklisted in LFG, it's wonderful.
---
And here I am on a PvE server thinking I am doing the lord's work by saving people from accidental big pulls by healing them and beating down mobs on them
---
I'm going badass too!
---
It is far more horde than alliance on most servers, so you will experience alot more ganking on alliance side.
---
Respect
---
Use auctioneer. You can relog to alt and get up to date price in like 7 seconds easy.
---
 I have been playing on a couple of private servers as horde. Switched to alliance for classic and my experience so far has been that there are a whole lot more gankers who enjoy making other players lives miserable playing horde. It was my impression as well playing horde and my first hand experience now has just confirmed it.  The racials and just the "feel" of the faction I guess is it. The type of player who like griefing others like to be "an evil badass" or whatever so horde fits that more than alliance. More appealing I guess to gank as an undead with spiky hair instead of a gnome.
---
 Can only imagine how crazy it will get once honor is introduced phase 2 if people are acting like this already without any honor for kills. 
---
 Worst so far has easily been undead mages. So many instances of ?? or red mages ganking and emote spamming afterwards. :D If anything though I am starting to really hate horde which I guess is good. Felt a bit strange to playing alliance at first and viewed hordies as my friends or something.
---
trade chat is a fucking joke when you take 2 minute to think about what people sell and a at what price. People asking dozens of g for blue item lvl 25, people multiple times more pricey than AH. I'm kinda mindblown that people even waste time trying to do those thing, when they could just use their hands to farm instead of trying to profit off people.
---
I stood next to a quest giver in ratchet and like 3 hordes managed to click on me instead of the quest giver which made the guards attack them. Another horde warrior watched it all and spammed /laugh
---
Funny shit haha
---
people say this shit all the time, but as someone who's played both factions the same thing happens no matter what side you're on. i get "faction pride" and all but people really love to think that the opposite faction is the only side that plays dirty in pvp. it doesn't matter.
---
Rogues are the most fun to fight because they dodge so damn often
---

It's Humar from the barrens. It's on an 8 ~ 12 hour respawn timer. I personally sat and waited 11 hours for mine to spawn, so I hope you get lucky and get it easier than I did.

That guild name though.

I usually kill opposing mages doing AoE pulls cuz they farm mobs I need. Dont look for cowardness or dishonor, I just don't want to wait for mobs to resspawn so I kill you.

Yup :)

I have to admit I did buffing people a few, but since power word fort Rank 4 fuck that shit, I don't even buff myself. It's useless anyways to farm.

What level is he? I already fucked up on my first rare spawn in the dwarf area so need redemption!
---
Listen, you guys are going to have to strike a balance between classic and modern sensibilities. He pays exactly as much money as you do, and the blizzard mindset isn't interested in protecting severe griefing stuff like this. 
---
Not you "should" strike a balance. You're *going* to. You have to meet these players somewhere at a comfortable middle if you want classic to both succeed and continue to be invested in and given dev attention. Take it from someone who has worked extensively with designers, things like griefing **are** going to be patched out. You have the exact same recourse to not liking that as any other player, which is to not play. 
---
These are considered functionally necessary changes in the medium of video game design. Going back to classic isn't going to change blizzards outlook on griefing and damaging player enjoyment and retention.
---
Which no one would take seriously so there's no real reason to say it..
---
I already went there it let me swap mine.
---
Will check it out, thanks mate. Actually already using it haah
---
I've never played undead so that makes sense for me :)
---
Honestly just group.
---
If you need because you are greedy and want money, yes you are the asshole. That's the whole point of those 2 buttons, and even words.
---
Is there a macro to stop wanding and cast a spell? I find it really awkward to weave in a Mindblast between the global cooldown. I often end up casting much later than I intended to because I have to wait for another wand cooldown to pass.
---
How am I being a summer child? Explain, please.
---
Let loose a little bit bro

Auto attack on 1. Classic.
---
&gt; Locking picking is something the rogue has to spend hours leveling up  like a profession which makes it acceptable albeit a dick move to charge  for opening. 
---
Locks have to permanently dedicate an entire bag slot to soul shards (and often times much more than 1 bag worth).  That's an entire 16-18 slots of your bag space missing from your character at all times.  Which means you often run into situations where your bags are full where you might need to throw away something to pick up an item, far more often than other classes do.
---
Trying to make it sound like rogues are the ones most inconvenienced by their class specific abilities and that somehow entitles them to charge for it or hoard it for themselves is laughable, especially in a 5 man dungeon situation.  Leveling lockpicking is a mild inconvenience compared to dealing with soul shards.  And yet I'd still never expect someone to pay me for a summon/healthstone/soulstone in a group.
---
I honestly was too excited to even read it at the time, lol. 
---
These guys were awesome
---
You don't know its name. I wonder, will you even contact me when rolling on another realm to check if you are doing the mistake? As a side note, can you even confirm that we are on different realms right now? Do you know what and how I do? Maybe it was me who helped you with quests or it was me who hijacked your quest mobs. Why? Because I commited both actions.
---
Isn’t that the spot where if you did a mount and jump combo right you could get underneath storm wind.
---
Two things: you sadly picked a full server. I'm on Atiesh - never had a queue anywhere &amp; I rarely have to wait for quest mobs/items. Or if I do, it's a normal slow respawn &amp; not waiting for everyone else to ninja it. Look for character transfers coming to your realm next couple weeks. 
---
Second, take a few days off. Build up some rest bonus &amp; let the crowd out-level you. I had a Rogue that I got to 14 before I decided I didn't like the combat style. I was always surrounded by people but nothing as bad as your description. Started a feral druid (yeah, i know) and there's maybe a couple dozen people in Barrens with me. Enough for the chat &amp; community to seem alive, but no quest competition anywhere. 
---
Basically I was 2 days behind myself (time it took to match my rogue) &amp; now I'm in a sweet spot for population. 
---
It's not a race - take your time, catch some fish &amp; level your cooking. Farm some herbs. Go back &amp; help a lowbie for an hour just to show him how great the community is &amp; how cool his class will be at higher levels. 
---
I'm having the best time I've had in WoW since BC &amp; WotLK!
---
Got a 14-slotter from a world chest. Was happier than if it were an epic, probably.
---
How would one replecate this? It's awesome !
---
Well I'm horde for one, so even if you were on Deviate Delight I wouldn't have to play with your dumb ass. And secondly DD is a low-med pop RP realm so statistically I can be confident that you're on some kind of edgy shitter realm where cooperation is rare because everyone is self absorbed and racing to get into a steamer raid.
---
just go shadow, after wand mastery there is no usefull talent elsewhere for leveling. Healing talent are useless because your base heals will be already more than enough to be able to sleep during dungeons.
---
You don't need high /played to level tailoring, just throw some gold at it and problem solved. It's actually almost free to level currently, just craft bags for as long as you can and you should break even or even make some profit while gaining skill points.
---
Gotta admit, this does look pretty awsome
---
His jump was calculated. But man, was he bad at math.
---
Nobody misunderstood you. You are still profoundly confused, and I hope you get better.
---
So you're saying that the world first rag/ony guild isn't tryhard? :thonk:
---
On my server (EU-Transcendence) its pretty peaceful, with a few exeptions. Just a few idiots messing around, but most horde players just let me live and do whatever i want. Got ganked once yesterday in STV but had a tauren protect me for a few minutes till the idiots were gone. Maybe the high pop servers are a bit more difficult...
---
Dunno how you guys did it unarmed. I always do it onearmed.
---
You sound very intelligent. I am certain Blizzard's warning was incorrect. Good luck with your crusade to justify your legitimate actions in the game.
---
Yes. Fuck you. It's not even the correct word.
---
You're below average.

this is the very reason every alliance is kill on sight

The cleave group mentality has ruined SM and ZF dungeons for sure.
---
As a warlock I'll just say you'd be surprised how little dots does to break fear.
---
The chance isn't linear relative to damage dealt so dealing the damage in one hit has a lot higher chance to break than a lot of small tics dealing the same damage.
---
For enemies in PvE the norm seems to be to not break fear early even when they have all 4 of my dots on them. I've had the same happen in pvp multiple times as well.
---

I actually have 3.5 brain cells thank you very much.
---
What did I just read..
---
I remembet the first time seeing an herb called gromsblood.
---
Not the OPs point but I grouped with a mage yesterday as a warrior and asked if I can have some food;
---
“I only have low level food, I never levelled it’s because I don’t need it”
---
The Forsaken quests in the first two-three zones actually lay the groundwork for the "use of plague".  
---
You begin in Tirisfal Glades, which is still struggling against the Scourge. The Forsaken tries to make a plague (called "the new plague") to use against the scourge. You gather herbs/mushrooms etc., and start testing them on subjects. Unbeknownst to the allience, Forsaken actually has captured dwarves / humans, and the apothecary has the genious idea to test this new plague on non-scourge subjects.  
---
Later on you go south to Silverpine Forest to work on the plague a bit more, and then to Hillsbrad. There you start using the poison on small animals (a frog first), and you actually end up poisoning and killing a dog (friendly to allies and horde normally)!   
---
The whole new plague sub-storyline goes throughout whole classic (I'm sure other zones have the continuation of this, I just haven't reached em yet). And in WOTLK you actually create the "perfect plague" just before the wrathgate storyline. So in a way your character (as a horde) contributes to the creation and perfection of the new plague.  
---
As evil as it may be, I really love the Forsaken lore. If you enjoy it as well, or would like to read up more, I'm writing my leveling adventures in our guilds blog at [here](https://goblinrocketfuelrats.com/stories/)! It doesn't feature the plague (yet), but has other great lore.   
---
^shameless ^self ^advertisement ^woah!
---
Nah. Would not be good if we just believe everyone in chat that said someone was a ninja. Spread the word with friends and guildies. Server chat makes you look like an asshat. Who would stop the mage typing the same shit. Hopefully noone would believe him then.
---
They suck for druids. Immune to nature and bleed damage...

Pretty sad, please fix this Blizzard. No, it's not grief.

Not retails fault at all, seems like you're pulling that out of your ass. 
---
Keeping threat in retail in higher end content is actually a huge problem, but you probably don't care. However, keeping threat as a warrior in classic is STUPID easy. 
---
In AoE, Spam Demoralizing shout. In single target, spam sunder. It's really so easy that in many large pulls, you will literally be pressing one button for the entirety of it. "Wait for 3 sunders on the mobs" is a hugely outdated mechanic, and isn't even necessary in 99% of encounters.
---
The lack of actually needing to manage threat is so huge, that most speed groups literally don't even grab a tank. It's not necessary at all. 
---
People are so quick to accuse people of not understanding threat/aggro here, but so so rarely do they even understand the mechanics themselves.
---

Most guides do not take the current economy into account and just tell you to craft white items most of the way. Sure you need less cloth  that way, but you have to vendor everything you craft and it ends up costing much more than if you were to craft bags or something else that you can sell to players.
---
They are very good tanks. Bear druids may actually be the best tanks during the leveling phase. I've also seen many try-hard guilds using them for mc and onyxia aswell. There is a YouTuber named "skarm tank" he has many in depth druid tanking guides. 
---
On the other hand, I feel anyone that rolls a druid to heal is going to be left disappointed. Their healing output is weak, they don't scale particularly well with gear either. Sure, druids bring some nice utility, but again, not as good as what a paladin or shaman can bring. Also, not having a res for 5 mans is just completely shit.
---
Do you hear his call?!

If a raid of players is standing around a flight master and you cant click it easily, are you going to report all 40 of them? No. You /target or turn on nameplates and right click the flight master.

I don't know if you have time or any desire to have an alt but you could make an alt for the family guild and join a raiding guild with your main?
---
Otherwise, sounds like your family just uses a guild as a glorified friend list. Tell them being in different guilds doesn't mean you can't do almost all content together.
---
Worst case scenario, wait for your FiL to drop the guild to do the content he wants and just drop the guild yourself as well, citing the same reasons.

Ok, then proceed showing everyone how you don't deserve a warning for being a dick... by being a dick

I just hit level 40 yesterday with my priest. And i am unsure if i should spec full shadow, since i love to heal in dungeons. Would i be able to still make a good healer with a shadow spec till i reach 60? Atm i am kinda dual skilled with shadow and discipline. Thanks in advance.

But you gotta admit, the karma grab worked!

Okay so my 2 cents (as a rogue) if the chest is locked the rogue should get it UNLESS someone else can unlock it then roll against them That being said if the group does not agree and you really want to stick to that roll finish the dung find a new team. But if you really don't care (I don't) and people want to roll and you lose then suck it up you agreed pick it open if you really wanted to be that guy either don't unlock it at all or just snipe the chest say it's locked it's mine or something and see if they kick you I guess don't roll then be a dick if you lose. (Sorry for grammar I have 2 kinds of dyslexia so writing is not my strong suit)
---
Isn't that now? The guys who all took a bunch of time off and rushed are all 60 and doing prebis /MC.
---
I definitely feel even casuals are trying to force cleave groups even when they then don't even pull like a cleave group. This is an outside perspective though as I was in a preset group.
---
There won't be a classic+
---
Today's developers just don't understand Warcraft, nor can they recreate it.
---
Can't teach a cat to bark and you can't teach a dog to purr, today developers have no clue what made Warcraft great.
---
The fact they couldn't even understand what made classic so great for so many years and got everything so very wrong is a testament to this.
---
If be fine with them creating a new game from scratch, but leave the Warcraft universe alone.
---
Lets not go down the same path that will destroy classic again.
---
If blizzard truly wants to "move forward" then maybe its time to make a new IP, create something original, and stop leeching off the glory of a game developed 15 years ago.
---
Maybe dont respond saying not to do the thing I just told you is impossible to do, you fucking dolt.
---
You got me in the first half
---
Now what? What do you mean now what, now we can play the game.
---
The level of cooperation you are expecting is too high. Stuff like that needs voice communication. People in dungeons are trying to kill stuff as fast as possible and don't want to deal with finicky mechanics. it's better just to get high spirit gear, cast only the most efficient healing spells and wand while you wait for the tank to take damage. 
---
Spirit Tap is a levelling/questing talent, it's so you don't have as much down time per fight. If it was meant for dungeons it would be based on teamwork, not last hitting.
---
You are wrong. TBC makes wow great, it was good, TBC makes it great. Its only two weaknesses were arenas and flying mounts. 
---
Had they just made another 10 man bg and allowed rated BG teams it would have been much better.
---
TIL shade is gone
---
"I can't grief people like I used to. Let me do it again!"
---
They also changed the way levitate works in Classic, or to be more precise they changed the way it works in BfA and it currently works in classic as it does in BfA minus some animation and the ability to jump. Pretty disappointed about that one.
---
I won't use it, thanks for the advice, a guy wanted to buy from me for 100 gold, but I knew it was worth more than that

So, this is paying for forty different accounts at once, right? So that's a nice 600 usd per month.

---
The state of Druids depends on the maturity of your group.
---
The best position for a Druid is to be a Flex position in your group or raid. In a 5 man, this is a DPS slot where they can pick up off tanking duties, DPS, or Healing duties with just a weapon or gear swap. This significantly cuts downtime in a dungeon as well as allows for riskier pulls with the safety net of the Druid's flexibility adapting to the needs of the group.
---
Druids are often more pigeonholed in raids as you've generally gotten one of the 31 point support talents (LotP or Moonkin for 3% melee or spelled crit aura) that will slot you into one of those two groups, or Tank/Healing talents that will define your raid role. Nevertheless, Druids are essential in pushing progression as you are able to adapt your raid team through merely changing gearsets on Druids as their inherent abilities are less dependant on specific weapons or enchants or procs, but more on their base stats and player skill.
---
The downside of this is it takes quite a bit of effort and bag space to acquire all of these pieces of gear for a Druid.
---
As for viability:
---
Druids can main tank raids, but they will need a weird amount of tradeskilled farmed items (Smoking Heart of the Mountain, 265 enchanting, for example), odd itemization (Agi/Sta/Dodge) that requires you to take a lot of PvP gear and Rogue drops to do it. You're also fighting against not having the same Emergency cooldowns as a Warrior. In most fights, a Druid will do fine as a tank. I think most tanking experts have labeled about 3 fights in all of the raids in Classic that are untankable as a Druid, but at least a half dozen fights where we are favored over Warriors.
---
As for 5 man Dungeons and 10 man content, yeah, Druids tank those expertly.
---
Druids are some of the best raid healers as well, as their HoTs have very good coefficients from +heal as well as the most Mana efficient heal in the game (Healing Touch).
---
Being a Druid is one of the most rewarding experiences you can have an an MMO, but the mountain you climb in skill, experience, and gear is a long and arduous journey. Nevertheless, it is a very powerful class in the hands of a master.
---
Bartender and SexyMap are my personal faves.
---
Huh, okay. Check some guides to learn how to play your class, the first levels (till 15) are without massive gear improvements, after you will start getting upgrades and it changes how you play. I can pull 2 mobs my level and be fine, for 3 i need potion and evasion. Playing smart is the most important things, and you can always go back and finish some green quests, why - the mobs are green so you kill em fast. You can always try to group up and ask people for help. Everyone was new once.
---
*You talking shit?*
---
not on US dude, most ive ran into is "me first, then me again !"

---
I really don't understand why people won't learn that druid dps is more than viable, even competing with the dps of a warlock.
---
Engineers and Blacksmiths can roll with a Rogue over locked chests, no others can.
---
Same with Mining, are you gonna roll over nodes in Uldaman? LuL
---
Only Miners can / should!
---
Onyxia bags are generally bid on for gold that goes to the guild bank to help fund things like thunderfury. So if you wanted to, you could just farm it out.
---
No out-of-combat rezz is the biggest issue for 5 man content IMHO. But that's part of classic.
---
Would have, or would've. There is no would of. 
---
Come on, we're better than this.
---
Isn't BFA what 15 years of experience in MMO looks like? :D The devs of retail are probably too ignorant and too full of themselves to believe they made a great game worse for each expansion (tbc excluded) and just believe that mmo's are a dying genre. Hopefully the success of classic will be a reality check for them to start bringing retail back more to how vanilla/tbc was. Most likely won't happen at this point though, now they have two mmo's for two different kind of players. I hope they bring TBC back when classic is at it's end, that was the peak of wow. Only bad thing about tbc was flying mounts.
---
First time i level up a priest.
---
It's so slow... What talent tree should I go with knowing I want to heal in dungeons while leveling? Is discipline + shadow good enough ?
---
Also, any not too fancy adding you guys are using?
---
It’s nice buffing low key and then you get buffed. I think people on classic truly appreciate the game from a legacy standpoint and understand the M.O. I 100% agree with you!
---
I would say expect around 150-250 gold from this. Its rare, sure, but its not as big of a deal as a mount or some BIS epic boe.
---
Not sure if it is mentioned below, but I find it helps to place a skull on the target you will hit most. Good DPS will only attack this one and gives you less trouble overall.
---
Probably Deviate Fish.
---
Go ret, pursuit of justice, reduced judge cooldown , command seal is good shit. Do quest for Verigans fist and you will see big numbers.
---
You can heal dungs (just put on some int pieces), tank early dungs (I tanked dm, gnommer, sfk, bfd and stocks no problemo with 2h and only swapping for shield on hard hitting bosses) and groups with you as dps literally cant wipe cuz you can heal, bless protection on healer etc if things go badly and your dmg output isnt bad early with good wep and command. 
---
And with engi nades and target dummies you can easily pull and kill 4-5 enemies at once (so groups of mobs aren't no go like for warriors) - when low just place target dummy and heal, low again divine protection and heal again
---
What is your progress on the mount money?

Im at work and can't remember the guild name but shoot me a dm here and ill make sure you get invited later :)

Aspect of the cheetah, running backward while dropping a trap on the ground, rogue get hit by your trap, Hawk aspect, hunter's mark, aimed shot, auto attack, serpent sting (in case of Vanish), arcane shot, boar pet's charge (especialy if he uses sprint), concusive shot to keep distance.
---
Keep refreshing serpent sting and kite him between auto shots to keep distance. If he gets to CAC, instant Wing Clip (you could also switch to Monkey's aspect to avoid some hits) and try to build space again.
---
You could also keep Cheeta's aspect to keep distance but you should be prepared to switch fast in case he throws a knife to avoid being slowed.
---
If you're not using a Boar, you can send your pet right after starting castin Aimed shot (or simply attacking him).
---
Also as people said, Track Hidden can help you spot him in stealth in case he didn't hit your trap. If you spot him, instant attack to prevent him stunning you (arcane shot, serpent sting, etc...) and run to your trap and when trapped do what I said just.
---
You could also you stay just next to your trap (back to it) and regen. This will make him try to get in your back to get a sweet sweet ambush crit instead of just using Kidney shot to stun you and get trapped.
---
In case you're fighting a mob and you see him stealth from distance, try to change your orientation in order to force him passing by you're mob's position (most rogues will take the shorter path to reach you which is straight line) and when you guess he is close to it, use Multi-shot and you could hit him that way.

Really? Why would anyone leave

People roll on the most populated servers then complain when it's populated. There is an easy solution to avoid all of this.
---
They're abusing the AH system, tricking those into buying that sort results by lowest bid.
---
He's level 23 and the area is occupied by level 19-ish lions.
---
If you cancel a item that has been bid on then you must pay ah fees (5%). You can't cancel a bid that you have made however.
---
And frankly the rest of the horde cities too.
---
Just say your lockpicking isn't high enough and then after the the last boss, when everyone hearths, go back and slurp all the lootz for yourself ;) 
---
Or if you're feeling altruistic, then let them /roll
---
I, myself, always unlock for the group because it is kind of a dick move but everyone here comparing it to making water or a soulstone are just wrong. It takes forever to level lockpicking. Especially now, in the early days of classic, can you imagine taking hours out of leveling time to even be able to unlock a chest in SM.
---
i have no problems with it, its not 100% accurate but thats no suprise
---
it has options for every feature is has, should be able to do what you asked for

Cool this is what I was looking for, don't plan to tank that often minus dungeons, love to heal

Per aspera ad astra

I say this as a mage. I \*\*\*\*HATE\*\*\*\* the cleave/aoe/speed farm mentality of so many players right now. A good part of the blame goes to many of the popular streamers and guilds who showed how effective a strategy it was and now  even more are doing it or want to.
---
I have managed to get into groups that weren't speed runs, but most of the time that's all you see in LFG channel. So I tend to not run many dungeons.
---
Time to reroll alliance

Every server is horde heavy so you can play safely the carebesr faction anywhere

I heard from a video by platinumwow that there exists an addon called EZdismount, that seems to help with these sorts of issues, maybe give that a whirl?

On private servers, sure. In Classic WoW, 350 happiness from one on-level food item lasts about 20 minutes for a Loyalty 6 pet.

you have to get the OG waypoint too, so no, wount help for bank alts

Try turning auto loot off.

Buwahahaha Dumb ass Garden Gnome. Typical to be honest. God this was fun to watch.

I would but I don't know these dungeons very well and I don't want to try to lead one then windup wasting everyones time because I have no clue what to do. Not even sure how to get the mallet that you need in ZF.

And from what I've heard of realms, stay away from the streamer realms, that's about it. Then it's pretty even on many account, but horde seems to be very popular this time around

Says entitled and selfish but yet wants to claim something they potentially can’t even use. Get a grip. Unless you have BS keys the locked chests go to the rogue 100% of the time, there shouldn’t be a discussion
---
It's mainly that people were far worse. Just now i was watching one of the APES guild members streaming their 2nd MC clear. I timed their shazzrath kill and it took literally 25 seconds. If i just looked at the health bar i would have thought it was a trash mob.
---
After clearing mc they split the raid into 2 20man teams and cleared onyxia this way for double drops lol
---
Did somebody say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?!
---
Wrath was only peak in numbers, still inferiour to Vanilla and TBC by a longshot.
---
Shadow and disc tends to be the preferred way. I LOVE shadow priests and am currently a level 31. I spec’d full shadow, but at 60 it’s something like a 36/14 split if I remember correctly.
---
So much hatred. 
---
I'm not on a high pop server. And don't play with this your's friends: "streamers".
---
Use your retail account. I heard if you get to 60 on it you get BFA for free? I dunno if it's true. Since it's been inactive I assume you don't have it yet so a free expansion would be great. Ganking will happen on pvp regardless but the community will be strong. Just announce you're getting ganked/ camped and soon you'll have an epic war. I'm not playing, but I'd figure I'll give my opinion anyway since you asked :)
---
If you're the dps, you're not leading the group anyway. Tank and healer will dictate group movement and halting. The mallet comes from an elite troll in the Hinterlands, search Mallet of Zul'Farrak.
---
Oh youuu... Dont talk about that... I think i might have a nightmare about that bc i forgot how little druid could do when theyre shapeshifted😪
---
You are a ret pala so defenetly go tank :)
---
Are you saying that reddit has more diverse people than the whole human race?
---
Lol read your own comment. You are doing what you are complaining about😅
---
Gandling is well populated and only has a small que in primetime.
---
don’t worry about your armour, you’ll get armour from quests and drops. Do worry about upgrading your weapon though. That’s extremely important. Google Paladin weapon progression, there are tonnes of good guides.
---
I think you have to create a Chinese account. I'm also trying to play classic wow from Shanghai and the only solution I found is to creat a Chinese account
---
&gt; How far behind am I?
---
Not a whole lot. You might even find it bit easier to level now as a huge number of players are somewhere at 30+ levels. Still lots of low level players to group with.
---
&gt; Think I'll be in the ganked by fresh 60s wave at this point?
---
It's not that bad. You don't really see 60s ganking lowbies, or at least I haven't seen such happen on regular basis.
---
&gt; How much do we know about realms at this point?
---
That the queues on the most populated realms are bit lesser than they were a week ago. All the realms are still very populated. There's a wow census addon around that some people like to run, and you can likely find some screenshots around to see how the server faction balance is, and how many people are online at any given time.
---
&gt; Is it worth making a new account for a 'fresh' start or should I use my retail account for convenience?
---
Just use the old one, unless you have some clear reason why you'd want to make a new account.
---
That... doesn't help.
---
So when you go to the site you'll out in race, class, and solo/duo/trio/etc play style. If you choose solo, it's going to omit all dungeon quests.
---
Are you able to heal dungeons or do you just DPS?
---
to fool those muggles
---
You sound like someone who doesn't have a phone.
---
Classic+ is the dream
---
ME SMASH
---
Do you roll for mining veins and herbs for the grouo also even thou you dont have the rewuired skill/profession? You still could not get to those herbs and veins alone so we must establish comunism and share everything. Also next time you are in dungeon ask how much gold everyone has , and redistribute their backpack content so everyone has equal amount.
---
How does the loot threshold get decided? It says “once passed the loot threshold, then members can only roll of items they can use, etc - something to that effect”.
---
Or does turning this on just simply only allow people to roll on items they can use with their class?
---
No, but calling anyone over the age of 30 a boomer is a meme.
---
&gt; It's only ashenvale and silverpine once though?!?
---
It's also Hillsbrad
---
Man, this is decent writing, was fun to read. I really hoped that the warrior dont just pop berserker rage and split you in half. As a horde person I’m sorry for your trouble, not all of us this disrespectful and dishonourable... :/
---
My best guess is that it is either: 
---
a) users of auction house addons which are to lazy/dumb to correctly set prices. Maybe these prices are as intended by these addons. 
---
or 
---
b)  Chinese gold farmers that deserve to get their souls ripped to shreds endlessly. 
---
This would mean that this phenomena is limited in time. Since the majority of gamers are not millenials, they are used to work for their stuff and don't use shortcuts. Also they are generation which is good with money in real life do they would not spend it on imaginary items or wealth. So with declining demand more and more Chinese gold farmers will turn back to other sources of income.
---
Yeah, I'm reading this and just like... "what?"
---
I did, It's not a bug on my end. It's a blizzard bug. Loads of other people are having it as well, and I was fishing successfully yesterday.
---
Have you called the suicide hotline already?
---
I guess I should clarify something. If you want to heal, I have healed up to WC (22-ish) as a full shadow spec. 
---
Tanks HATE disc priest for heals because priests rely on power word shield (bubble) to handle some of the “healing”. Tanks can’t generate as much rage without taking damage, which means it’s harder for them to hold Agro. 
---
Holy is the recommended way to heal, but leveling with holy is tough
---
Sorry you wasted your life on Alliance. You have my deepest sympathies.
---
You can also get free 14-slotters from an uldaman quest and a short 3-quest chain called "Cortello's Riddle".
---
32 warrior here, I feel so much support from people like you; it’s as if the other players understand, I get tossed heals and support pretty often.
---
And I try to quest with my dad who plays a paladin, and then we are almost unstoppable. I go from serious struggles with two mobs to pulling entire camps with ease.
---
I highly recommend leveling with a buddy of you are a warrior.
---
Informative and fast reply, thanks
---
Zandalar Tribe (EU RP-PvP) is actually tiny bit alliance favoured (at tops 55 to 45 type of deal) to my knowledge.
---
*World of Warcraft: Animated Series*
---
Blizzard when?
---
You can also skin mobs :)
---
I'm assuming so because your story sounds like bs but judging by the way you act I'm not sure there are any further questions lol
---
Because you used all your rolls in Barrens
---
hey man! really good inputs - been trying it out and once you get good at it - it works like a charm! i forsee a lot of increased dps by doing it this way! however, the addon is super ugly imho. if you put in the extra work of making it simple and minimalistic in terms of look, and a bit more functional, you've got yourself an extremely valuable and necessary addon for all hunters right there! keep up the good work!
---
Warriors gotta respect each other even on opposing factions. We've got it tougher than spoiled mages and edgelord ganking rogues. I'll always help horde warriors coz levelling is hard enough.
---
I don’t see it.
---
The locked Dwarven Gate leads to Searing Gorge. If you go to the east  (middle of map of Lock Modan) there is a passage that leads to Badlands right next to the entrance to Uldaman :)
---
Anyway, here's Wonderwall
---
Plenty of times people are recruiting just for regular groups. Most groups especially early levels will take simple hybrid specs. Played with plenty of ret pallys and I've done plenty as a kitty druid.
---
U wouldn't get the to the chest without healer and tank. Rogues who do this get kicked out of groups. If u think your that entitled just say you can't open it then ninja it when everyone leaves. Least no one is none the wiser that way and doesn't cause drama.
---
currently speaking to someone now
---
With all the retail cross-server shit those people dont realise that on classic they will bump into all those people (or their guildmates) again constantly after they hit 60. That few gold pieces can make his raiding expirience horrible.
---
Lets hope they go classic+ on classic and introduce cut content :)
---
Are you serious ? 
---
Idk, maybe not struggling to understand what ones want to express when writing something ? Just a thought, but that might be practical /s
---
EU RP-PVP realm has so far been the best community I have ever played in, lots of world PVP events with wars between each faction etc. Faction balance seems almost perfect too. There are still fresh people joining all the time, so you could always jump into this server and be in a good position.
---
Locked dwarven gate is for Searing Gorge, not badlands.
---
For badlands you go slightly right, through the trogg area, and south.
---
Basically east of Uldaman if you're looking at badlands map.
---
Or Maghartrain
---
I disagree. There are different components of the game, and I play the parts that I enjoy. For me, the game is about the story of the world, and the journey and development of my characters. I like to see where life takes them and watch their individual personalities take form. 
---
One of the things I like about WoW is the diversity of things to do. There is something for everyone. PvP isn’t my thing, I can still play and enjoy the game without it. My game experience is different than yours, but I’m making the most of the parts I enjoy.
---
r u ok
---
What are you going to do with your newly acquired Scourgestone?
---
Well.. The thing is now there are maybe twice the people per realm playing than the highest free server, ah is different, so he might be lucky and get even more money or even less. In 1 month when there are much more 60s we will see.
---
Damn straight, and if you don't like it go back to bfa and hide in your garrison little carebear.
---
As a rogue it hurts my soul.. Hahaha
---
I saw another ally hunter and a warlock coming up to this spawn point for a quest, an NPC threw a curse on the hunter and i thought it was the lock, so immediately started attacking, hunter told me no he was chill till you attacked him, I felt bad /apologised and came back a few minutes later to help him kill his mob once it had respawned
---
Huh?
---
Are you sure that's in vanilla/classic? I know they added one in a later expansion.
---
Just wanted to add; I’m a casual player, and I split my time between two characters (one I play solo, one I play with my husband)... they are both between 15 and 20. We also just made new characters yesterday that are still in a starting zone. I had a lot more fun on our new characters yesterday than I did in the starting zone with the other 2. The starting zones and areas we quest in are still pretty populated. Not quite as overcrowded as right after launch, but still a good population to interact with. Chat is active and you can always find a group for a hard quest if you need it. There’s still competition for quest resources, but not to the point of having to camp a spot and hope you get the first hit on something for 30 minutes. I’d say it’s a great time to start, based on that. 
---
I’m on a regular server not a PVP server though, so I don’t know how much of a difference that makes.
---
As other people have said: 1.12 talents, 1.12 itemisation. years of experience of WoW mechanics and guides about talent/BiS everywhere. 
---
So yes: dungeons are a bit of a joke (though I'm lvl40 so didn't experienced all) and I find it a bit sad and concerning if lvl60 dungeons and first raids are just as easy.
---
Where exactly is this spot? Coords would be great.  Just dying to know.
---
Btw I am not Horde.
---
&gt;	Sometimes I think the developers forget they are working on a game called Warcraft.
---
Sometimes I think some players forget that there are something called PvE servers and that no everybody is insterested in PvP.
---
A guy was advertising in trade that he was buying silk at 38s per stack. I got in touch and decided to COD them to him.
---
For some reason, after clicking "COD" and then "yes" in the confirmation dialogue, my selection auto-switched back to "Send Money". I didn't realize until after I sent the second stack and noticed the confirmation dialogue was different the second time.
---
In other words, instead of CODing the first stack to him, I sent the guy 38s and 20 silk!
---
A few things here I encourage others to do that I naively decided NOT to do:
---
1. Don't tell the person you unintentionally didn't COD the item. Once they accept it from the mail box(it takes 1 hour to arrive), Blizzard will no longer do anything about it.
---
2. Check. Double check. And triple check your mail delivery selection before sending(even if you're sure you clicked the right one!)
---
3. Always assume people are going to take advantage of you when they can, so matter how friendly and polite they seem to be.
---
As you can see from the chat, I told the guy what happened, and asked that he graciously return the money and items to me(I had originally planned to COD several stacks of silk to him).
---
He was very polite, understanding, and even engaged in friendly conversation with me. I told him I was level 40 and only had half the gold needed for a mount. He asked about my professions and making gold, tried to offer tips, etc.
---
Initially he said he was logging off soon and probably wouldn't be able to return everything right away, or that he might 'accidentally' auto-accept it. Because I told him of my mistake, he stayed online an extra hour to make sure he got it from the mail box so Blizzard wouldn't retrieve it in time.
---
He pretended that he didn't get anything other than the one stack that I did successfully COD to him, then logged off immediately after getting the nice loot I sent him.
---
Really not a big deal lol, it was just 38s and 20 silk. But wanted to give this warning to others who attempt to COD mail. Don't make the same mistakes I did! :)
---
Would of? It's have mate.
---
I'd say, let rogues have it except if someone needs to \*wear\* (not sell) the green
---
You're a weakling.
---
I'm alliance on a PvP server with many more horde than alliance.
---
Brb making a new guild
---
Haha, might be a regional thing then.
---
Yeah, happened to me too.. Try link below that some other dude posted. I think it's called Wide quest log or something like that.. Works like a charm
---
What if you were bad? I would ninja just so you or anyone who knows you never parties with me.
---
.. yeah, but OP wants to ‘emote’ something of his own design.
---
/e wants to learn to play the ukulele 
---
Would read
---
datguy_86 wants to learn to play the ukulele.
---
To all nearby members of your faction in the orange emote text.
---
Charge leve 130k
---
By that point you wonder why they don't just play Starcraft instead😊
---
It's the area where all alliance druids come from,  logically the homeland of the furries is going to be weird
---
Few days ago I had a rouge ignore the roll all together and say since he was unlocking it, the chest was his.
---
Seems a legit gold making strategy.  Those mounts aint gonna buy themselves.
---
I have 60gold to invest with.
---
I legitimately used to keep a set of pally int gear, my DK had all weapon skills to max before they removed it (Including fists)
---
Voip and better understanding of the game. But my feelings as a healer are similar, the only time there was any challenge in dungeons (upt o RFD atm) has been tank losing aggro or just not paying enough attention if a mob runs away or a pat walks by. Still maybe two wipes in total from all dungeons.
---
&gt; but if everyone understands you if you write "tho", that's not a reason to keep the arcane spelling rules of "though".
---
And you know why everyone understand that ? Because "tho" doesn't mean something completely different in the first place, whereas "of" does.
---
My point is that it's not a simple spelling mistake. It's a spelling mistake made by people who don't understand how the language they are speaking (and, in this context, natively for the most part) works.
---
Well, I'm talking about the launch week casuals
---
Esdf here too! I changed to it because I'm left handed and it changed my game tbh. Can reach so much more now.
---
Ah. I don’t know how many quests there are as I’ve only been there for about 2 minutes to grab the fp and I saw questie markers. 
---
Thanks for the grats.
---
I don’t believe that to be true at all.
---
Don't worry about being new to tanking, first of all you will only learn by doing, and secondly just tell people that you are new to tanking and I bet they will most of the time be happy to help. There are a bunch of guides on youtube for warrior tanking in classic if you want some tips before starting.
---
Explain why only 140 guilds managed to do naxx then? Didn’t say it was hard either, just said maybe less than 1% will ever do
---
Yup, garden adornments should stay inert and only receive love from wacky home brew botanists
---
I am a launch week casual. Or, I thought I was. lol
---
I tried to hover over to read the buffs, you're not alone
---
Do I have to be 225 cooking before it's offered? Was there yesterday with skill of 215 and didn't get the quest??
---
If you are healing specced you can generally do dungeons a fair few levels higher since its made to be done by dps specced healers.
---
For example, i as a mostly-holy pala did SM lib at 29 even if its a 35 dungeon without issue
---
The real issue is convincing the others of that
---
That’s because those of us with mediocre names are ashamed.
---
Because
---
People just wanna see what's up if there's any action. You created action. A cookie for you.
---
Does fire nova totems stil do damage to your faction when you put it and quickly logout? This was similar to this.
---
Take your upvote and get out!
---
Also depends on YOUR time you got to play. Most people sink in 4-5 hours a day, and rather then questing a lot of people just grind dungeons
---
Go smite priest for AV :)
---
That's why I have turn on arrow keys so I just auto run and turn with those without having to take up important keys for that shit. I only move with those when I'm eating and running or something.
---
Chromie: "Maybe this time, it will be different..."
---
Dude, it's only 140 guilds because maybe Naxx dropped not long before TBC and barely any people bothered with it?
---
Assuming we are not forced into TBC Classic upon getting Naxx then a good majority of people will experience it.
---
Im a tank and i dont like the idea or AOE dungeons (Just i dont know how to tank that), so i prefer normal runs, just don care what my team looks up. For example yesterday i run RFK with 4 shamans and it wasnt hard at all, or SM Graveyard with 3 rogue and a hunter, still easy and forward.
---
Just people that group wants a rush to 60 and spamm the AOE thing.
---
PD: If a tank focus skull, pls do it easy for them and focus it, dont split the damage or you just cause more headache to healers,  tanks would be full health cause cant hold threat of all the pack hahaha.
---
Unless you're doing something super weird in the loot department, standard loot settings pre-split cloth drops by rotating looting rights.
---
If I'm disenchanting equipment I brought to the dungeon from elsewhere you have no claim on it, and if I'm disenchanting loot from the dungeon I've either already won it - in which case that loot and its components are mine to do with as I please, everyone else already had a chance to win it - or someone has asked me to disenchant it on their behalf, a service I am happy to render, in which case the materials are returned to the owner of the item and a small tip may be offered; at their discretion.
---
This really isn't a complicated concept, and I'm not sure what kind of point you think you're making here.
---
You can't do shit while shapeshifted, but you can trade with other players. Unplayable!
---
You make the groups cause noone wants you in theirs
---
Nope, it\`s just ur brain making you believe it is. ;)
---
I’m really wondering about this as well.
---
Did it really look better at blizzcon?
---
Man I wanna do that too, but I feel so dedicated to hard grind my first character. I envy you! All and all, my statement would be true if you put all that time on 1 character they'd be about 30 35
---
Keep telling it like it is, it's clear you struck a sensible note for these bfa pet collectors, they fucked up that game now they wanna ruin this one as well.
---
oh nice thanks :)
---
I’ve had silly amounts of those masks just from normal playing. Not even a rogue.
---
I am killing everybody, literally everybody I meet I attack. Especially I enjoy killing players fighting mobs while having low health and than stealing that mob at low life. When I kill someone I emote them to make them feel even worst, welcome in my realm.
---
awesome thanks :)
---
Sold one during WOTLK for 12k g. Let's just say my alts had the fanciest bags ;)
---
Thats actually kind of impressive.
---
Nah that's an accurate statement, unless you are also specced into imp sap
---
*Combing through comments to upvote grammar corrections and downvote comments complaining about the grammar corrections*
---
I'm about to reroll rogue just to tell people I can't do the chest, wait for it to be over then go back for it.
---
&gt;Bug or *Sabotage*?
---
The author of the thread knew what they where doing.
---
Elaborate why it’s broken ?
---
You grind them because you like the skill... like agility? Mining? Construction? You’re insane if you think a majority of players enjoy skilling
---
The way of a true orc warrior! Did you get the arcanite reaper recipe yet?
---
Also, do you think it's better to level professions only from level 60? Currently I'm a weaponsmith at level 44 (obviously aiming for axesmith later) but I feel like the spec will only matter when I'll be 60 🤔
---
I have a macro keybound to a mouse button for when I pass a mage.

It was a wand
---
I used to keep a blacklist of players that ninjad and ganked, avoid + tell people and kill on sight respectively.
---
I don’t know the answer, but you simply saying don’t upvote, made me want to upvote. 
---
I’m curious on this as well. Reported (as did many others) an incredibly vulgar player that was personally verbally attacking people and I’d be curious to see if blizzard cares.
---
I was there and it wasnt really the case no, 3 months was plenty of time. Again, not implying it’s superhard, but average 1-2 hours a day a couple days a week won’t get to there and they won’t bother cause they enjoy other aspects of the game.
---
I think more people will go for the PvP rewards than Naxx and AQ
---
Generally, you're looking at 2-3weeks after a boss has been killed by a warrior for a shaman to start facing ced boss.
---
Or would've
---
No you don't, that is what greed is for.
---
this looks like people acting out a comic
---
Currently, I'm leveling my warriors both on horde and alliance, simply because I fail to decide which faction I want to play. As far as I can tell, there's a bit more going on on the alliance side.
---
Thing is, whenever I log into one character, I find a handful of reasons on why to play the other faction.
---
And if you are throwing dots on me while I am fighting 2 enemies and being on 10 % hp, I want to say, fuck you. I will find you and kill you, then kill you many times after it, over and over again. I will skin you alive. In game. With skinning knife. Somehow.
---
[I have just one question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xYaTGRvpv4)
---
Horde is just way cooler. Humans are boring, short humans are boring, shorter humans are boring. Night elves are a decent race.
---
Horde have minotaurs and zombies which are way more aesthetically interesting, trolls are kinda crazy looking too. Orcs are a little vanilla for me but still more interesting that three size variants of humans.
---
afaik thats also how Warlock soloed Serpentshrine boss by jumping up and down the ledge and boss would path the long way around it?
---
Had about the same experience yesterday as level 32 priest. Me and a warrior spammed RFK 5-6 times. On the last run 3 IRL friends joined. They were fooling around, and we had to wait for 30 min for them to get there. They needed on all items and didnt roll for chests. 
---
We left them at the last boss and the escort quest, just to teach them I lesson. I told them to keep their retail kid mentality for when they were doing things alone, and not taking me a as a hostage in their stupid games. They reacted as expected and just laughed......
---
I mean... We all need the gold for the mount at this point, just follow the simple unwritten rules. Made me mad, but then I remembered that just as OP, this was my first bad experience in Classic wow so far. 
---
Horde sure talks a lot about getting love...
---
I swear hunters just equip it and then vendor it once they leave the instance
---
Oh yes I forgot that bit. Well that makes me even happier.
---
They definitely are they just don't care. You seriously don't even need a 'tank' in most vanilla dungeons. A warrior just going full DPS mode is often a much better tank than any tradition tank as far as dungeons are concerned. The problem is people are treating the dungeons as if they warrant a traditional tank when they absolutely do not, especially up to the 50's. Damage is very rarely what kills groups in vanilla, it's going oom. The solution to that isn't getting tankier it's doing more damage. No one ever considered that in vanilla when it was launched but it's been metagamed so hard now threat really doesn't matter until raids.
---
Copper, bronze, whatever. The smallest denomination.
---
Better racials &amp; mohawk
---
No cosmetics, cosmetics lead to microtransactions and this leads to retail
---
Druids are good off tanks at start, then in AQ and Naxxrammas they pass Warrior Tanks because high armour and threat levels.
---
lol I've been playing a lot but I've been doing nothing but questing. I'm also taking my time to read all the quest text and shit. I'm in no rush to hit 60. Already thinking about making another alt. Fuck.
---
Buy only skills you use frequently. Sell everything and maybe by lvl 42 you’ll get your mount.
---
absolutely.
---
Forget a /s?
---
http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Gandling
---
Gl getting in a group as anything other than meta aoe dps tho..
---
&gt; In pve you will just go oom after few casts so it's not viable. You will heal in pve as shaman.
---
You are confusing viable and optimal. And being OOM is not a problem in Classic WoW.
---
Can’t think of a reason to not wear this beauty
---
I just went to Northshire Abbey tonight and gave out a bunch of free linen bags to people last night
---
Son of Arugal. Extra relevance.
---
Efficient as in amount healed, and he wasn't in combat when he was healing, ofc when you're in combat you would use the faster heal.
---
I always think this when I see cats go ham on monitors. Like I'm sure they don't use their claws but still one mishap and RIP monitor!
---
It's sword for humans mainly because you're a warrior.
---
1st: You have that +5 bonus skill in sword that means that at level 60 you're skill in swords max leveled should be the same as the one of a lvl 61 that means more hit and that mins less glancing blows against bosses parries or misses
---
2nd: You are a warrior and your auto attacks generate rage. The proc from the extra swing on swords also generates rage. That means more buttons can be pressed
---
Normally resetting your modem changes your IP, sometimes it doesn’t in that case you can also change your IP through command prompt but you’ll have to google how to do that I can’t remember off the top of my head, it was super easy though! good luck!
---
Your friend is going to whine about the game no matter what you do. None of the servers are dead. Tell him to quit being a bitch.
---
&gt;guaranteeing effective randomness.
---
If this was the case, there wouldn't be many hundreds of laws and loops and certifications to go through when making a gambling game involving RNG.
---
Thanks, I'll look into it. Sounds like a good fit and useful!
---
I went to kill some time (to wait to main hype fade a bit) to play RoC and tFT. And I'm not doing it only to remind myself the old graphic before remaster comes out. Nope. Not a bit. 
---
WHEN IT WILL COME OOOOOUT?!
---
I use this addon, and it just occurred to me I don't know if it handles separate servers. So, if I scan on my horde, then go play on another server, will the auctioneer know not to display the prices for items from the scan on the other server?
---
Sort of, its more of a mental list at the minute! A lot of it is similar to my original twink too.
---
Played Rogue the whole TBC (shaman whole vanilla) and always, always rolled for locked chests. 
---
Thinking you are entitled to grabbing locked chests as a Rogue in a dungeon is idiotic and nothing but greedy. Get real.
---
But what happens is you skin a bear?
---
I’m gonna guess Paladin
---
such an interesting Father and Son interaction

Yeah I aggree completly with you. (the problem I have with this is elsewhere, see my answer to another post)
---
I remember them being elite. 
---
Then again I played on private Servers for 3-4 years... If the private Servers got it wrong my mind probably got it wrong as well....
---
Good for us right now though :D
---
Holy shit.  
---
My buddy who has never played wow before now, but was a huge W3 mark back then is going to flip his shits next time we go to undercity.
---
Nitpicky but yes
---
At this moment, no. Maybe in the future.
---
Looks like the wow setup for those "erotic movies" people tend to meme about.
---
If this is a serious question, then it's a player who goes out of their way to get the best possible gear for their level and then stop levelling so they can dominate PvP at that level.
---
Actually lockpicking is Rogue time to shine and contribute. I always have high skill enough to open every entrance/chest/lockbox for dungeon. Never asked for tip. I roll need on lockboxed though through leveling process but we roll for it afterwards.
---
&gt;Once I started spending all of my time in cat form, I’m finding it harder to get the motivation to shift and buff and shift back.
---
Yea but i still try to do, if i dont do that, the other one has already the druid buff or is out of range😅😅
---
I feel like it was intentionally put there for a reason you just didn't understand. Preach talked about it in his latest video. Title was something like "How Do You Level So Fast?".
---
Yes, its 5 or 6 in total. They are disabled by default in settings. You can enable.
---
What would fortitude do, increase fall damage?
---
Gotta love pulling pranks on my friends!
---
or it might have something to do with the fact that you are quite ahead of the average player? Just maybe :D
---
Gz
---
i've tried to go and do my daylies but it was awfull
---
I'm sitting on the toilet at work trying not to break down laughing at that. Wolcraft omg
---
I’ve just switched over to Resto at lvl 52 and started running BRD. Actually aiming for 30/0/21 stopping at nature swiftness. 
---
I would stick with enhance until lvl 50+ when you start doing Mara Princess/ST/BRD. I healed SM Cath, ZF and Mara no problem with just a healing set of gear in my bags. But an enhance shaman with Ravager is pretty sought after in a lot of dungeon groups.
---
Lylz was the first lvl 60? I don't remember that.
---
Even taking that into account, in vanilla, Alliance outnumbered Horde. The current ratio, especially in PVP servers, is a consequence of the ratio in retail.
---
i think you're right, everyhting i do is better than playing retail atm
---
Also its easier to sell on AH now
---
Got Broken Tooth after my first 2 minutes in badlands without layerhopping. Blew my mind
---
BFA is 15 years of paving the road to hell with good intentions.
---
Lok’tar ogar!
---
Such I good point. I agree.
---
How broke are you now?
---
That Lion is Lord of the Gays
---
That’s fucking sweet in a cohesive world kinda way. I know I was awestruck as a kid back in the day whenI saw level 60’ies effortlessly murder skull-level mobs
---
Nothing beats a pet for tanking, screech generates insane threat and reduces damage by a ton on top of that it's the only reliable way of generating aoe threat.
---
seems so, but it's not a bad thing, i'm having fun playing wow again :)
---
Need...sure. but more is better.
---
Rogue here, I dont give a damn about the easiest class to level whining about being unable to AOE down 10 mobs in 20 seconds.
---
This is where we agree.
---
Humans are boring...all versions of human are boring
---
Night elves are awesome.
---
Taurens are awesome 
---
Zombies are kinda cool...like nightwing 
---
Trolls kinda crazy 
---
Orcs boring.
---
Its also like a year old economy
---
I was about to post that but you already did.
---
Well my friends hyped the classic alot, when it came we played it. Now nobody of the playing it anymore so i keep playing retail 👌
---
Not a game for me but I get what you mean. Last 3 expansion I've been playing for a month or two at release then quit until the next expansion in hopes of things getting better. When I play wow it is because I want to play an mmorpg, not a single player game with multiplayer aspect. I mean, they might aswell just add bots to run dungeons with you and you wouldn't even notice a difference.
---
Holy fuck that was a rollercoaster read, we need more.
---
Holy fuck, youre AIDS impersonated
---
&gt; You can dungeon tank but raiding wouldnt be possible without a taunt.
---
Prot paladins have to leap frog threat, any half-decent guild can manage this. They can tank raids.
---
If you dont like following guides, stop buying guides.
---
It sent you to grind for a reason. If you dont like it, research and make your own guide.
---
Use /cast !shoot
---
If you press twice it won't cancel the wanding.
---
For the Alliance!
---
It could be wonderful. Like raider.io ... Oh wait
---
Alright so I just dinged level 50 through ZF grinding. What maps would you recommend to start questing?
---
And also every class that isnt a druid or hunter...
---
Did you expect to win with a 1-roll? ;)
---
Yeah, Lylz, the tauren shaman. I don't remember that much to be honest, just a flurry of memories and names.
---
I mean the game with is _literally_ built to waste some of your time every day, by making you fear you fall behind while actually making any character progress void after each major update.
---
Yeah it was brown for me too, maybe orc eyes.
---
You are absolutely right. These things make classic good.
---
Oooo I forgot about mohawks 
---
That better racial is debatable
---
Tauren have the only always useful racial
---
But so do dwarves
---
Depends how you view it. Some people just let the rogue take it because it'd be skipped anyway without them. I as a rogue let everyone roll for it because I view lock picking as one of the reasons to invite me to a group in the first place.
---
I am a Tauren and I cackled!
---
Afaik nothing was in vanilla when it comes to online store.
---
Paid character transfers were only made available sometime in 2006 so very close to TBC release.
---
Who knows, maybe they will offer it but what they're doing right now with free transfers is something we've already seen and has failed already.
---
Wtf how dare he switch to something he thinks he would find more enjoyable
---
Classicserverinfo.com
---
Does charge counts? :)
---
Hey I appreciate the work you put in!
---
Made my first PvP vid recently and the people on Reddit shit all over me
---
Hoping u get at least 2+ nice comments!
---
Btw can I macro autoloot toggle
---
Agreed they are good, but they are by no means spamming what that guy said on my server at least.
---
Never contested them being good.
---
I second this suggestion. I play in it, lots of nice people all around. I have been starting my sessions with going to a starter zone and crafting free bags. 👍
---
I identify as a vending machine.
---
I don't think I'm edgy enough to understand what that sentence is supposed to mean, but I assume it's something negative. Regardless, I wish you good luck in becoming a more positive person!
---
What the hell am I supposed to do with this torch and pitchfork now?!
---
If wishing that people would use the easier and better option instead of the shitty one is considered entitlement, then I'm all for it.
---
A elemental shaman you will be casting 5 times and then go oom, this is just the reality. I am saying no viable because inless the raid leader is your friend and willing to carry you, you will never enter a raid group as elemental.
---
If youre a greedy a-hole yes.
---
Hi all.
---
I opened a post but now I saw this so I will comment here and delete the post.
---
I started playing in 2005 and I always loved paladin but I played a lot of classes. Anyways, in classic I decided to try a mage, went to 14, then a paladin for a bit and left it at 12 then a hunter at 12 too and then a druid to 16.
---
I like the druid and paladin more, I know paladin is boring attacking but I love the lore, I love the spells I love getting blacksmith and doing my own stuff ... it feels great.
---
However I rerolled the paladin in a PVE server because I don't want to get frustrated. Anyways, right now I'm a lvl 12 paladin in a PVE server (EU, not sure about the server name right now) and I have some questions:
---
1) What seal should I use? right now I have Seal of Righteousness and Seal of the Crusader. By reading looks like I could use SotC, judge it and then SoR for the increased holy damage but mobs are going to die so fast that it might be worth more to judge SoR and keep with SoR up. However, should I just go SoC for the increased DPS and never judge unless I want it to finish a running mob or I need to tag some mobs or should I go SoR and judge on cooldown (what I'm doing now)? In case it matters I have the level 8 copper great axe made by me !!
---
2) Is there any addon that helps me remember to keep up with blessings? I installed weakauras and I made an aura that would put 100% transparency to an icon when there was more than 2 minutes left and 0% transparency when there was less than 2 minutes to remind me to put the blessings. However, for some reason the game was stuttering (is that the word) ... I play everything in ultra and I get 144+ fps and the game looks gorgeous however the stuttering made me disable weakauras. Is there any small addon that could help me with this?
---
3) I'm lvl 12 so I have only 3 talent points and I have put them at retribution. When I played retail I was always a tank and sometimes I played as healer. I'm wondering, is there any retri spec that is worse dps than a full retri but can act as a healer but still be able to keep up with leveling? my first dungeon will be DM but at that level I think I can heal without very specific gear or talents right? I don't plan to raid, I enjoy the leveling experience and I will be doing dungeons here and there so I'm not worried about endgame, I'm looking for a spec that is good in PVE leveling and that can let me act as a healer so I can get into dungeons faster.
---
4) I remember you could buy extra bags for the bank, isn't that possible anymore? maybe because I'm using bagnon I cannot see it very well but I think I can't buy extra storage.
---
I'm Human by the way.
---
Thanks for any help!
---
&gt; I love to get buffed from players that pass me, sadly as a hunter I can't give back. A lot of priests buff me with fortitude in passing which is a very nice thing to do and I am grateful for that. But since I hardly take any damage at all while levelling since my pet tanks for me it would be doubly usefull if you would buff my pet instead of me.
---
Our hero
---
*Laughs in Will of the Forsaken*
---
Wrath was better than TBC on launch. But the introduction of the Group Finder and the content droughts kinda made it downhill from launch.
---
Oy vey!
---
And this early in a realms existence, there's rarely any lvl 60's there to ruin the party either. very cool!
---
Well yeah I think 3 months is literally nothing for people who have work. I can only play a few hours during the week (with most of my hours during the weekend) and despite this I still want to raid Naxx one day.
---
I just hit lvl 21 yesterday I am not even sure I will be 60 before phase 2 lol, heck in the worst case scenario I'll only reach it by phase 3.
---
Threat treshold of 110% and 130% is a thing in classic? What range is needed to switch from one to another? Is it mob melee attack range?
---
I really like your work. I'm not sure if it suits your art style, but the one quest I would like to see colorized by you the most is Sully Balloo's Letter. I think the picture is really touching: a dwarven soldier forgotten and rotting away in his wet grave deep under Thandol Span, still holding on to his last letter to his wife Sara. The quest chain starts so unassuming by finding the letter on accident, but you end up talking to his wife and even Magni Bronzebeard about the loss of a loved one, the pain of a king to sent his soldiers to die for the alliance, and finally commemorating the fallen and their sacrifice for the people
---
It's generally just community stuff, your server will have a discord, most top guilds will have a discord, and they will usually have a blacklist channel, you can just add people who make it onto there to ignore.
---
And when you do you’ll just wish you were still there
---
Thank you for this early morning laugh
---
In the ama they practically all but confirmed it. However it won't be until much later when most people have gotten to 60.
---
And they definitely shot down other character services.
---
Not sure about the answer from the other guys (which imo would be a PvP twink) but here in Germany a twink is basically any char that is not your main.
---
You either don’t have enough points to train it, or your pet already has 4 abilities.
---
Regarding professions: can engineers make arrows or only bullets? I've gone with skinning and mining for money, but I'm strongly considering switching skinning for engineering and just using my druid alt with skinning/lw to make armours for my hunter main.
---
Meanwhile I have 1 day and 4 hours played at level 40 cause I can't stop PvPing.
---
You said the priest mind controlled the other Horde.. it was you who were mind controlled.
---
You deserve to be exiled.
---
I wish they had a third faction of traitors/dishonorables.
---
Leave streamer drama elsewhere
---
Noted
---
Very true! If I had just played one I’m sure I would be 30+. I don’t think I could grind on just one character... for me they each have their own style and personality, and I may be in the mood for one over the another. And sometimes I just get sick of one for a a day or two. 
---
I think it’s interesting how we all have different play styles in this game, but the game is able to accommodate such a wide variety and still offer enough for everyone.
---
What you on about? Stfu about Trump I’m just reading about a guys story being a badass priest on wow and wanted more lol
---
I know your feeling.. I love the community don't get me wrong but some people just think they are so entitled. Lack of healing does occasionally happen on my part in these circumstances. Karma = repair costs
---
And pet will do honestly. Even the worst pet in the game is still a better personal tank than any other class gets. I prefer to go with pets whose looks i love.
---
But if you want to min max owl is good. Boar is great for overpopulated quest zones because charge can snipe  some mob tags from other players.
---
Cat is the best for world pvp while leveling because most od them have fast attack speeds which hurts casters a ton. This also gives them better frenzy uptime which gives them better dps overall
---
i'd be happy with the group finder, the mythic+ section of retail is the closest thing to running classic dungeons in retail, the group system there isn't too bad, just don't need the requirements criteria rubbish.
---
You say ‘do everything there is to do’. That would take months and months of time played. Aside from dungeons and raids there’s PvP which in itself can be endless entertainment. You have hours upon hours of quests to complete. There are many areas of the World to discover. As you mentioned, alts to roll and specializations to play around with. 
---
Cosmetics, as someone mentioned above, will lead to micro transactions and the potential to kill the ‘vanilla vibe’ with flashy colours and effects.
---
I would hope that after phase six Blizz look at adding another raid or two with increased difficulty and possibly finish off certain zones on the map to add more quests.
---
The paladin in the picture is holy. He has both Divine Favor and Consecration on his bars.
---
It varies greatly. Some people are perfectly fine with 6 hours a night, others might need 9 hours to feel equally as refreshed.
---
What the actuall hell are you on?
---
^^^^Wanna ^^^^share?
---
But you're travelling pretty fast ^^^for ^^^about ^^^half ^^^a ^^^second !
---
28-35 hours a week is casual?! That’s a full time job!
---
Bad bait, 3/10
---
I mean WoW skill is dependent on mmo skill really. Hand eye coordination. Your time playing doesn't affect your skill that drastically.
---
Gear is handled within it's own system and the important drops are frequently bound on pick up in dungeons; if a particularly valuable boe drops, individuals might raise a fuss over everyone rolling in it, but it's only expected.
---
Really going to lecture me on greed when the core principle of your argument is "Why should I share with the people that enabled me to even get here?"
---
If they lose subs that stop by using microtransactions your point is irrelevant.
---
https://discord.gg/35WCJp
---
I'm completely fine with not having any of the other character services, I just want to go back to my original server.
---
I'm actually a bi polar priest player.  I do these nice things a lot, but if I see people on my grind mobs then its war.  I'm ashamed to say I fear the mobs my faction are hitting, thus making them run away and pitentially pulling more, in an attempt to discourage them in "my area"... but then I will res them if the die.  I think I need to see a psychiatrist.
---
Maybe older mirrors are like the one in Harry Potter and show what the vampire desires most, to not exist.
---
Auctioneer or auctionator?
---
Vendor the leather or put it in AH?
---
Triggerd ^
---
You should post photo of your phone making a photo of your screen -.-
---
Lol, I'm 43 and well out of there now, other than going to help guildies who get corpse camped by the scum.
---
For a game to be said to be hard meta, and locking you into set playstyles, it offers so much more then retail ever could in terms of feeling involved in your class choice
---
I help if I see they struggle, but also wary since some people claim it steals their exp...
---
money well spent?
---
Technically to adhere to no changes they would have to bring in paid transfers as it was a thing before patch 1.12. however back then it was something like a 6 month cooldown.
---
It's that I want to be a guild leader, and I'm of the mindset that a guild leader should be the MT in raids, otherwise I would've stuck being a healer. Healing is just so much fun. Especially raid healing. It has the most unpredictability, and therefore is the most challenging.
---
Hit me with some of those gold farming options!
---
Maraudon and..?
---
What kept me going on my warrior back in the day was the knowledge that one day I will be able to give it back.
---
I ganked so much after I dinged 60 it’s sickening.
---
They literally go reeeeeee every time you aggro them
---
I have plenty of skill points and I still have one slot free in the action bars. I can fill the empty spot with other abilities like cower.
---
Not gay at all.
---
9 days?!?! 
---
Go outside now. Or I’m telling your mom or something.
---
According to Petopia and wowhead cats can learn claw.
---
The language you read, write, listen, and speak is not insignificant. There's plenty of idiots that leave high school thinking it's cool to slouch off because they believe everything they were taught isn't important. The rest of the world just laughs at them.
---
WWWW
---
Definitely, especially given the incoming disappointment when the population imbalanced servers have terrible bg queue times
---
Tsm?
---
You can as a mage, just frost nova the mobs, and make sure the friendly player is closer to the mobs than you when they are nova'd. They aggro the nearest player. Cone of cold the mobs to break the root.
---
Retired? Long vacation? Stay at home dad with no kids? Jobless? How lol, I must know! And nice work, solid char you got there.
---
Feels great when people think they can take you at an advantage and you end up absolutely handing their ass to them.
---
Some of the pre raid bis items for every class are boes.
---
And that's the beauty of Classic, people have the freedom to be assholes.
---
Being upset is allowed, but throwing a fit is just childish
---
Classic and skill..... :D bro any competitive shooter requires 10 times more skill than classic.
---
Gods, sorry for the various questions but it feels so good to be able to ask without feeling stupid: I have a druid alt and I've noticed a big boost in uptime and dps once I got the cat form at 20. Unlike retail where main abilities are the main source of damage, classic's auto attacks are fantastic since I open with faery fire, moonfire, switch to cat, claw, rip, autoattack once or twice, and its dead, then I move on to another mob staying in cat form and just claw twice, rip, autoattack, and move on continuously. I may have to stop and heal after the 5th or 6th mob which was unthinkable as bear. 
---
Why do druids get a bad rep? They seem to be very decent, kind of like a rogue but with more tools for the open world (heal, bear form, travel form, roots, etc) and I imagine they only get better once you get other damage abilities for the cat. Is it really that bad or are they bad only from a hardcore end game perspective?
---
Yes this. I'm dying to slay some boars
---
Yeah, probably :D But first I need to fix a bug. Currently waiting for a friend to have some time testing the fix before I upload it. And then I'll create a new reddit post ^^
---
EU guilds don't give items to meme specs before real specs.
---
30s to heal you when you pull aggro
---
Which add-on gives vendor prices?
---
shadow priest owns warriors which makes the game being overran by warriors even more hilarious
---
Totally agree with all of your points. No need to downrank before AQ40 or something. After that point.... its a meh meh.. You dont really have to downrank per se. 
---
People make healing way to complicated.... Like healing 5 man dungeons... As a priest, I only need 3 buttons (My biggest rank heal, my biggest rank of renew and my wand).. It is that simple.. Do not heal the MT before he is under 65% HP or so. Keep renew up if you have the mana for it, and you know he takes consitent damage. Melee classes (rogues and dps warrior, just throw them a renew. They normally do not take big chunks of damage)
---
Mages... Dont heal them unless they are lower than 50%, they have so much surviveability.
---
All in all.... Healing in Vanilla is super easy, also when raiding. Just bring your brain and KISS (Keep it simple stupid) :)
---
Yeah that's exactly it.
---
They've done this before- open a new server and transfers there and when most people don't transfer it just becomes a dead server with players trapped there.
---
Really the only solution would be transfering 3 low pop reals onto a medium one and just closing low pops down. I know people would be outraged but having one full server is better than simply hoping players will transfer to a new realm and then having loads of medium and low pop servers.
---
I mean. I work 07:00 to 16:00. I have food ready, shower and coffee in hand at home 17:00
---
I game to 22:00 before I usually go to bed. Weekends is cleaning and washing days, still leave me with a lot of time. We talking 12:00 to 12:00. I might not have kids, but I do live on my own!
---
Lol don't remember them being this long... Awesome.
---
Method literally getting sponsored and still got trashed by some random pserver dudes one a 2 week vecation 😂
---
/r Shit Americans Say
---
Only rogues and UD are almost sure to kill you.
---
Fuck undead anything.
---
Common sense, is that you?
---
Charge -&gt; Hamstring -&gt; Leave Combat -&gt;  Charge -&gt; Hamsring -&gt; Leave Combat -&gt;  Charge - &gt; Hamstring...
---
All of these wrath/TBC babies really have rose tinted glasses on.
---
Yes I know method is eu.
---
&gt;Is Phase 6, Naxx, and T3 armor the end?
---
I hope so hard that isn't it and they just go BC+. While I was most active in BC it also implemented some things I absolutely despise and I don't want to play it again.
---
Housing would be great, this was one of the things I always wished for in vanilla. Tho, I also would like an armor cosmetic system, but seemingly a lot of people don't like that for weird reasons.
---
I always throw fort out on random players.....but especially on mages.
---
Thanks for clarifying!
---
Combat swords.
---
Name change was never an option and im very oposed to that in vanilla because people can ninja and then namechange, only character transfer existed and it had a very long cooldown.
---
I typically enable all of them even if i don’t use them all. Shove the clickable stuff to a random bar out of the way. I’m pretty sure default UI let’s you keybind them all but I’m pretty lazy with settings lol
---
Nice.
---
I dont think naxx / phase 6 will only last 3 months. Private servers show that people will have naxx on farm fairly fast. I cleared it in vanilla myself and on 2 different private servers. Finding a guild that needs raiders for aq40/naxx is as simple as looking.
---
 People tend to quit or get bored around aq40. Lots of guilds will be looking for people with all sorts of raid times. Plus there are really only a handful of bosses that are difficult between both raids.
---
I never played vanilla, are shoulders that rare? I found some at level 18 and just equipped them because it seemed like just something I would find lol
---
Then that’s what you managed to produce today.
---
Why does it have to be all or nothing? One inch today, another tomorrow.
---
I also have tons of responsibilities more important then wow. So I finish those, and if there’s time to kill I can play wow.
---
Before wow released I just spent that time watching random YouTube clips.
---
Use this. For the moment it has a scan option, just like auctioneer, as far as i know (i don't use auctioneer), but soon enough it will have a separate database which will tell you the AH prices (mins and maxes), rate of sell and other stuff which do not come to mind atm. When this happens, all this information you will have without having to manually scan or anything. Just install the TSM desktop app and link it to the addon. Its take a bit of time to get used to it, but after that you will hate to deal with the AH without TSM.
---
I picked alliance coz all my years of wow i played horde and wanted to feel the game in new perspective
---
A lot of people like it for PvP, honestly all the movement abilities are great for getting your pet at the mob before you start attacking so it has aggro
---
Maybe ganking low levels of your own faction was deemed inappropriate? I agree that it sucks because I love trolling. I’m also not surprised.
---
I think this is the way forward and the most logical direction for Blizz. Fingers crossed
---
Different pets have slightly different stats and can learn different abilities. Cats and raptors have a higher dps than other pet types, but not by much. They have slightly lower HP and armor than other pet types though. Unlike raptors, cats can learn dash (speed boost) and prowl (stealth), which makes them more useful than raptors. So YES, as far as dps goes, cats are the best. 
---
The reason Broken Tooth is so popular is not because he does more base dps than other cats, but because he has the fastest attack speed of any pet in the game (1.0), which makes him better against casters (more pushback) and more attacks landed means more chances to crit (which procs the frenzy-talent). 
---
If you have auto cast on both bite and claw, does your pet run out of focus midway through fights? If so, disable one of them. Not sure which one you should prioritize, use the one that gives you the highest additional damage per focus point. If you pet has plenty of focus during fights, go ahead and use both.
---
Wanding is a toggle, I usually just smash my mb key until it overrides the wand, but you could just press your wand key again and stop and then mb I guess.
---
How has the lore and experience been since you switched?
---
Wow those are some some incredible stats. Need to invest in one when the time comes.
---
So this is what the afk guy who goes afk with no warning is doing in all my grouos.
---
They always say something like "back sorry someone was at the door"
---
knowing aint doing. dont get so buthurt ;)
---
standard frames already show when overpower (or anything) is available. if you need a huge flashing pop-up button / symbol for that.
---
 weakauras
---
a combination of a few factors: 
---
 * ammount of time able to play
---
 * experience / previous knowledge
---
 * interest in "smelling the flowers"
---
i am only lvl 21 because i play 1 or 2 nights per week and only play 2-3 hours each time. its not a race enjoy the game. :D
---
When to use/apply "Vampiric Embrace" in a PVP scenario and while leveling?  What if there are multiple enemies?
---
Your story only shows how sad Warriors are at PvP pre-raid gear.
---
Upvoted purely for the last line.
---
Yeah, because there are so many cosmetics sold in retail.
---
Most of the people I've ressed have thanked me. Not that they need to be honest. I just like to help them and saving them from a (sometimes long) corpse run.
---
Yeah, I've read that guide, and 10 others, they all say different things, so I kind of just wanted to find out which one is the "best", which is very subjective, but usually there's like a consensus. If that makes sense.
---
Wat why would you care about parses when many classes stand still and press 2 buttons? My point is there isnt really much difference between the best mage in the world in classic and just an okay good mage except for gear and lucky crits.
---
Literally no where... your priority should be to level to 35+ if you want to make a few silver from each kill. 
---
Farming gold at 18 would be a nightmare unless you can work miracles from your professions
---
I think you are highly underestimating how much better the community got at the game.
---
Its random. It gives 1-5. I've had items give me 1, 2, 3 and 4 dust so far.
---
Just save sprint for when a hunter does it then pretend you're busy doing something off the road before he catches up to you again.
---
&gt; aggro'ing the guards to attack the Hunter
---
That's how I can tell the story is bullshit.
---
Just the other day I was in Ratchet and I've been killed as a lvl 20 alliance in just about every corner of the damn town and not a single goblin got off their lazy butts to defend me. 
---
Not one.
---
Either there are no real guards or they are being buttered by nearby Orgrimmar to ignore horde aggression.
---
Very defferent specially when k used to lvl in crossroad and the desert everywhere in horde map but alliance no they have trees lol
---
If you're alliance say " ss ee oo p". It means ME LO VE U.
---
I normally get left alone after saying it
---
Hopefully people will at least try a bit of diversity, but im doubtful.  Yesterday in chat there were quite a few people spamming about specific class/lvl for deadmines.  Its fucking deadmines!  It was probably so the group leader could collect all the drops, but LF lvl 21 rogue for deadmines is just stupid.
---
The “night” elf didn’t clue you in to their gloominess? 
---
Not picking on you, just find that reason to be unique and made me smile.
---
Judging by how quickly and easily MC has been done I would guess specs will indeed be less strict. 
---
It might take a bit for it to move i that direction since people don’t really embrace change but it will happen.
---
It doesn’t work that way. Some specs just run out of mana too fast to work and some put debuffs the raid doesn’t want.
---
Also cook your meat before vendoring it. It magically doubles the vendor price with next to no effort.
---
Lol, yeah cheers mate, we’re trash. But not at WoW though, like you. GG NA.
---
The further you go up in the raid ladder, the less dead weight you can carry around with. In MC, pretty much every guild will be able to carry at least 15 people. In Naxx.. let's just say I don't think we will see much rets or oomkins there.
---
Balancing and spec viability hasn't really changed much.f
---
Something something broken arms.
---
well i prefer to draw commission on the right orc, there's too much orcs like on the right.
---
Haha.
---
I dont remember my thought process tbh. I was your standard kid, "omg elves are cool" ^^
---
Ya was tough, just quested here and did some aoe grinding, lv 25 now
---
You think you do
---
Fuck the meta 👍
---
I was making a joke :(
---
Green hunchback humans
---
Dead hunchback humans
---
Hunchback Cows
---
Weird hunchback Nightelves
---
I knew pvp servers will be full of horde and didnt want to lose time dying all the time.
---
Yesterday i helped a warrior kill a murloc in Redridge because he was about to die.
---
I say /s "you're welcome ;P"
---
He replies with "I didn't ask for help" and then /ignore on me.
---
My face man....
---
same story as always.
---
you can play ret, if someone will take you to a raid is up to them.
---
basically it comes down to -&gt; do i want a dps with 50% of the damage a other class can do or do i want a proper healer which is the most op healer in the game?
---
mathematics doesnt lie. all the optimal ways to play the game are proven. if you want to follow that is your decision
---
finding like-minded people is one of the corner stones in classic wow which will make or break your fun for endgame.
---
Wtf COD means
---
What different do they say? Skeleton would be the same. You need a lot of points to get to AR in the end of this. There would be variations for raiding based on gear.
---
haha yeah, instead of a 2, it will be a 3!!
---
Rejoice.
---
That is true 
---
Ppl who rolled alliance on pvp servers 
---
Are probably ppl who thrive for the pvp
---
Mine payed both my epic mount and Quel'serrar back in the days
---
Practical. I like it! Partially why I chose a PVE server
---
Amount of times I said this exact phrase in last couple of weeks is just enormous
---
I have no problem with anyone doing something they love a lot, but to say doing ANYTHING for 30ish hours every week casual is absurd. If you fished or worked out or watched movies or built puzzles for 30 hours a week would that be casual? 
---
I’ve been at points in my life (10+ years ago) where I played well over 30 hours a week, I completely see the appeal, but it’s not casual
---
I'm Looking for a duo leveling with a partner to reach level 60. things to consider whether you would be interested in Duo Leveling with me…
---
-Play on PvP server (eu) -Play together when we are both online, and then play on our alts when one of us are offline (i'm also online usually from between 3 pm to 8 pm, however I'll always be online past 8 pm..[GMT+2~3]) . I am looking for someone whose committed and available. -I'm gonna be a rogue dwarf, you can pick which class you want. I'm not restricting based on viability and optimal class composition but solely pick the one you will have fun with.
---
For mc/ony/aq20/zg? No. Probably not bwl either. But aq40, maybe, naxx almost certainly.
---
Nobody ever leveled a profession to mine in dungeons, that was going to happen regardless of dungeons and what nodes spawn in them.
---
As such, the only work to be taken under consideration is the work of actually getting there, which is, in an ideal world, shared equally with the rest of the party.
---
You may be wrong, but you are perfectly entitled to flip the board, shit all over the table and declare yourself the winner.
---
Have a nice day.
---
Let's hear it for white trash EU bois
---
Honesty as a mage the good thing is you can AOE and farm mobs easily. Go to any area/dungeon and do the quests 5x faster than any other class, you'll get loads of money in no time. Also get skinning and tailoring as processions and you can skin the mobs make an item with the mats you've gathered and sell that shit on AH.
---
If I get less than 7 hours sleep, I can barely function at work
---
Yup at hills, got decent xp, cept I kept getting ganked by lv40+ ally players. Lv 25 now tho
---
You are aware not everyone likes the shitty quests of vanilla?
---
I don’t know why, but people who play a game hard core is most of the time not very nice.
---
Mana isn’t such an issue for Paladins and Priests unless DPS pulls aggro if they are mainly a healing spec.
---
My holy Paladin drops around 420 health for around 15 percent of his mana at 30, and blessing of wisdom/passive spirit when the tank isn’t missing around that much is enough to get back up.
---
Here we go with the printscreen complaints again...Honestly more annoying than the photo.
---
Down to 15 here. I tried selling for 20g for two days, no buyers.
---
Is it possible to skip the server selection? I have only one character anyway
---
Paladins are quite good raid healers. Should have  no problem getting into a raid. Good luck
---
Just to add, I played fire mage in vanilla and I could solo the lv 60 elite demons in south winterpsring. But that was a huge thing and most people/classes were unable to kill an elite on their own.
---
So yeah, I also feel like classic is easier than vanilla was, but most of our vanilla-time was not 1.12...
---
Haha I will be making life of gnomes unbearable when I hit 60 kek.
---
Look, how can I bitch about superior tactics if I don't handicap myself?
---
Looks like a mad twink weapon for...shaman or something..?
---
Pro warrior tip, if you find a critter like a rabbit, you can charge it and then just keep moving without waiting to attack. You can actually do this with any passive enemy, and as long as you disengage before striking, they won't attack you.
---
that's my current situation right now, i took the migration to a new server they opened for the migration, faerlina -&gt; heartseeker, and it's a pretty dead server. I wouldn't have any issue paying, if need be, to transfer back to faerlina. Having a server that was full despite the queue times sometimes was so much nicer than being in one with low pop
---
Yeah if you just want to do the raid Ret will be okay because there are others carrying him. Druids have to do so much more just to be okay. 
---
Hardcore guilds that still min max for speed efficiently wont take a ret
---
I wish the rest of the group would understand this.. people complaining all the time they are low on health. When I ask them 'are you alive?' I become the condescending one.. Also, many DDs just stop outright dps-ing when they get below \~10% hp, it's as if their dmg output is proportionally linked to their health pool..
---
Make sure you're checking alliance side and not server side. Otherwise census will be heavily biased since horde physically cant pick paladins, but can pick warriors.
---
Every server i've seen so far had plenty of paladins alliance side. Shamans seem to be least common, followed by (surprisingly) rogues - at least for PVE servers.
---
I disagree.
---
&gt; Yet you and everyone understood that person [...]
---
I always read the sentence, notice something doesn't add up and read it again. Every time. By reflex, **because** it doesn't make sense.
---
Now, on the issue of the "spelling mistake", I still disagree. Switching a word for another with a different meaning isn't a **spelling** mistake.
---
WoW is not skill based.  Why would you think this?
---
10/10, also a 31 year old dad just trying to live my best life.
---
Currently Level 18.  You are my hero, sir.
---
Twitch bought Curse. The Twitch desktop add has the same functionality in regards to downloading add-ons
---
Are druids not able to shapeshift from one form to another without going through the base one in classic? Say I want to jump from cat to bear, do I have to first get out of cat form to my base race and then to bear or can I go straight from cat to bear?
---
Even though I’m on PVE, I love seeing a flagged alliance and try to take them down as a shadow priest.. fear, bubble, and dot
---
Wolf brother ✊
---
you get a 14 from a Uldaman quest
---
Oh wow! Thanks.
---
If only i could get the quests from retail with the difficulty of classic!
---
You won't get a guaranted spot just because you are a holy pally. Theoretically, a raid only _needs_ 3 pallys to get every blessing (Either Might or Wisdom, Kings, and the one that reduces Threat).
---
Also, pre-raid you pretty much contest with mages, locks and priests for your gear.
---
Breezy here. Was really fun leading the raid and playing with everyone. We had fantastic cohesion for essentially 40 random players and all around decent skill level. 
---
I agree that Noggenfogger on the whole, is a really nice community. This played large in part to even getting 40 people working together.
---
I think I spent all my luck the other day. 5 runs to Armory and i got:
---
- Scarlet bracers/belt
---
- Scarlet leggings
---
- Shoulder
---
- Helm 
---
- Aaaaand Ravager. All this as 36 warrior so I couldn’t even equip anything. I hope RNGesus dosen’t feel like he’s done with me..
---
On an established server ~600g give or take. Might take a while though.
---
Chestnutz vs Tubers!
---
What was the blizzcon 2009 water? I don’t remember this and google isn’t helping.
---
Some of them say to get riposte, others say not to. 
---
Then there's Sword Specialization which some guides tell you to get, and others don't. 
---
Also, some say to get Remorseless Attacks, while others say to get Improved Eviscerate. 
---
But yeah apart from that they're pretty identical
---
Dunno bout wow but unrelated mmo mechanic I healed a man fighting guards in eso and wasobbed by guard.
---
Haven't tested in wow but mechanic is plausible in the genre for sure
---
The only service I'd want is character xfer.
---
You sure should cast "Cock blast" on minds
---
I'm hoping they come sooner than later.
---
You'll need to either create mouseover macros (using the @mouseover command) or download an add-on like Clique which will automatically make your spells mouseovers.
---
I know I wouldn't have sooo maybe not?
---
Hard to get from the way u told it
---
Most pvp servers have more horde, i like it, more people to fight.
---
On the one hand, you're immune to fear and polymorph.
---
On the other you always lose to any paladin or priest you encounter.
---
Curse is no more, they're owned by twitch. The twitch launcher is the curse launcher rebranded.
---
Once blood elves are out u can live ur dreams buddy
---
So you do every quest on your way to 60? You cover every zone, speak to every NPC and complete every quest do you? And you NEED to take that same route with your alt also? Maybe you’re not playing the same game i am.
---
Btw, nice of you to pinpoint the quest aspect of my comment above, ‘cos you know it’s the part you didn’t like...
---
For me it's alt tab to my alt sitting next to auction house.
---
Depends on how intricate it is. My guess is it copies timestamp data down to the millisecond upon execution of the /roll command. 
---
For instance, /roll at 05:17:37.937
---
Simple enough in matlab syntax
---
Roll = time_stamp - floor(time_stamp);
---
% would yield 0.937 in the example
---
Roll_result = Roll*10 - floor(Roll*10);
---
% yields 0.37
---
N = 100;
---
% max value of roll
---
Roll_final = roll_result*N;
---
Display(%t rolls %g(1-N)).
---
&gt; So, I’m just throwing this out there for my own personal accountability.
---
&gt; I’m 6’4” 405lbs.
---
You play as you want in solo, but yeah you will be awaited to have specific behavior in dungeon.
---
spent at least an hour last night shote fishing near Ratchet worked just fine
---
You don’t need your first chunk of gold til 40, so I don’t rly see a point to farm gold so early, you will farm gold much faster in 30s
---
Does lvl 1 Rebirth share cooldown with lvl 2?
---
How much of a wanker do you have to be to have /spit macro'ed to a key?
---
Cash on delivery
---
Way of selling through mail.
---

---
I think this is your best yet.
---
I was running late, as always, and decided to jump for it anyways!
---
Little did I know, I got stuck on the boat hull and got carried all the way from Auberdine to Menethil Harbor. Managed not to drown and not to draw attention on myself :)
---
Humans and orcs can't look cool, this man won't be satisfied by anything that isnt fuzzy or has pointy ears lol
---
You are absolutely right. Druids are the most unpopular ones on alliance but not by much.
---
Dr is anywhere between 15 to 20s, depending on when the last server check happened (every 5s)
---
That area is so buggy. I love being murdered by spears thrown through the walls... Did that happen in classic?
---
Yes i cant fish on feralas, fucking annoying bug.
---
Yes, hunters hit in melee range very often. Kappa.
---
I would kill to watch this episode
---
I know right lol. It's so hard to sympathize with this guy's cause when he only wants the infernal for trolling purposes.
---
Sure, it worked like that in vanilla, but I hope blizzard takes their sweet ass time fixing it
---
Druid: Travel Form  
---
Hunter: Aspect of the Cheetah  
---
Shaman: Ghost Wolf  
---
Rogue: Sprint  
---
Mage: Blink
---
That I doubt.
---
Funnily enough never liked Belf starting zone.
---
If i were to order all the starting areas in order of my personal preference:
---
1. Mulgore
---
2. Durotar
---
3. Dun Morogh
---
4. Silvermoon
---
5. Kezan
---
6. Azuremyst
---
7. Elwynn
---
8. Wandering isle
---
9. Teldrassil
---
10. Gilneas
---
11. Tirisfal
---
If you got to level 40 without noticing a massive imbalance, it's probably not that bad. The census info may not be accurate.
---
Hahaha
---
You can still make one
---
-&gt;DOT 
---
-&gt;Fear Enemy to China

becus BAABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
What addon are you using for questtracking, looks pretty good.
---
You rerolled a warrior at 42, when they finally go from a glorified auto attack paladin to whirlwind at 36 and mortal strike at 42? 
---
Damn man.
---
Yep. Im a priest and if I see a warrior the minimum they get is a buff and whatever heals. Ill generally stop and hangout to make sure they finish whatever quest they are doing in one piece.
---
I feel like I remember hearing/reading somewhere that Tauren didn’t originally ride Kodos, but instead gained plain-running. If I wasn’t already 2 hours past when I should have gone to sleep I would look it up.  This would have been alpha/beta.
---
&gt;So you do every quest on your way to 60?
---
I ... don't exactly understand what you are trying to say. Why would I do that?
---
Not OP but - from which method do you kill more mobs per hour? Waiting for the tainted blood stacks and attacking or just drain tanking? I'd just do whatever kills this faster.
---
You may use riposte for leveling (I dropped for now). You don't need it for raid (everyone who attacks you there will smash you and this riposte wan't save you) and so on. The guide I linked is about leveling. Others may be for raiding. And they will have optimizations for specific cases. Icy-veins has bunch of variants for different gears. I'd suggest take leveling one for leveling. And you may tune it for yourself, in the end of the day at that point 2-3 levels and blue sword will outperform most of "adds 1% chance to hit"
---
I just did ZF yesterday though it was the worst group so far. Several wipes due to tank' s complete inability to pull and los but still.
---
Thank you a lot!
---
Never played shaman in vanilla and currently leveling one(19 atm). Does it get better? I feel quite squishy, and my mana runs out so fast. Just wanna make sure I will be able to crush some fools at 60 and heal in dungeons/raids. Priest does look pretty sweet.
---
I wonder what was their "/played" to get to 60, but I bet it's way less than my expected "/played" following my way of playing.
---
It's not a bug yes, it was still used to grief. Which is why it has been removed. Same with mages being able to polymorph other people's tag to reset them.
---
Heh, thanks mate!
---
I got mine a couple weeks ago for hella cheap like 50% off or something.
---
VendorPrices or ClassicVendorPrices, check twitch for it.
---
Why include flying at all, then? I could see it being used as mechanic for dailies, or within a raid/instance, but for normal world travel it was a bad idea.
---
First time i play vanilla but i remember in BC and WOTLK, after a while, when eveybody knew the dungeons, we would rush as fast as possible, the only thing was "do NOT die".   
---
In vanilla, eveybody know the dungeons by heart, so eveybody wants to go fast.  
---
Find a chill guild / friends that have your playstyle.
---
Jesus christ, you're too stupid to understand the discussion. You're wondering if I play warrior and you're the one call people bad for using Berserker Rage in the opening rotation, as if it extremely important to get a MS off after Charge and Blood Rage, when you're bottlenecked by rage after the first one. Really I should be asking you if you've even leveled a warrior at this point, because your stupidity is surprising me, lol.
---
Wow this sounds like a chore
---
Mages get aggro pulled due to their spells and get killed as a result.
---
Thanks to you, kind sir!
---
If you think the game is really that shallow you're in for a surprise.
---
What's the faction balance like on your server? Been thinking about rerolling Horde somewhere.
---
One time I missed the boat and jumped after it anyways and somehow landed on the window.
---
People were absolutely much worse back then. My guild in vanilla fell apart at Sapphiron. Why? People couldn't do the simple mechanics that fight had. They would die to the breath for example, something that I saw people get kicked for in Wrath.
---
„Then we make the expansions again.“
---
It's called GuideLime and I am using Sage's guide at the moment (17-19 Darkshore)
---
Literally dropped enchanting yesterday for skinning.
---
This story is either fabricated or the warrior was a complete idiot.
---
Any warrior who charges a priest knows that reflex fear is coming and immediately pops berserker stance with a finger hovering above berserker rage to break the fear.
---
14 hour days what the fuck? Do you even sleep?
---
I always preferred Dabu, it is for the sophisticated Orcs.
---
Well I only got so many holiday days left :) so...No I can't do it definitively unless I chose to "work from home" hahah
---
What else can we say but, "a c ‚ c ÇÈ ‚ f 30" ?
---
Pandarens were in Warcaft 3 aswell, there's no foreshadowing in that case, it's part of already established lore
---
Disgusting. 
---
I did get scarlet chest yesterday though after getting ravager!
---
Orcs to the slaughter.!
---
It looks like 60-40 horse bias. As I leveled up to 50s I started see more ally. I think layering was the problem at low levels.
---
Roll on unlocked. 
---
Rogues automatically get locked. 
---
That what I expect from dungeons as a non rogue. If there was no rogue we’d have no chance at it anyways... besides what is to stop the rogue from coming back later and looting after pretending his skill is too low? 
---
Therefore, Any rogue who does roll on locked chests is exceeding my expectations.
---
What kind of stupid question is that? Of course it hasn't. You're supposed to whine like a little bitch in the forums, then immediately point fingers and blame the devs for absolutely everything that's gone wrong in your life. Duh. ^^/s
---
is that even available for classic?
---
That makes sense, it's the same as always then. When I multiboxed I think I just killed some mobs, left the dungeon and repeated, when bosses were too difficult.
---
PvP is all skill. Not 1v1s per se, but competitive BGs are where you can easily see who’s good at the game and who isn’t.
---
Yes, Tanaris and Feralas as well.
---
Surely you get a stamina increase after that half marathon
---
Druid here, no fucks given!
---
I had a group of 2 mages less night AOE frming mobs needed for a quest.  They would pull them right from under your nose, too.
---
If I see a mage AOE farming they get no buffs or heals from me unless I know them.
---
For leveling, for the most part anything will do, you only need the specific pet abilities for specific scenariosn (like a spider pet for PvP and a Wolf pet for raids)
---
Though as far as my personal opinion, bears are the best since they eat anything (unlike something like Wolves who only like meat)
---
People have already kited dragons into SW.
---
Horde wise, it's shamen. You want to have at least one in every raid group, so 8/40 are shamens
---
Lol have fun losing out on 1000g from Staff of Jordan then, I'll gladly take it from your hands.
---
Because, if this was possible China wouldn't have wow, even if these were removed from that version of the game. Not sure if undead can eat dead player bodys still though in China WoW
---
Hi, /u/Prixm
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2o1vo/classic_client_keeps_on_crashing_after_13_minutes/). 
---
Oh boy am I so excited to play Diablo immortal!
---
You can complete dungeon without loot from locked chests.
---
I mean it's not like enchanting is a bad profession by any means, and on the long run it'll probably make you more money. But it's harder because all the really good recipes drop in dungeons/raids or are really expensive on the auction house.
---
I've never played retail, but hopped on the Classic hype and am very much so enjoying it. I was doing my first or second run of stockades, and through the dungeon I received a Skeletal Club. Now I was incredibly happy that i got this drop, I had been looking at weapons in the Auction House and KNEW this was a badass upgrade for me. I was stoked. Then, one of my fellow random dungeon runners told me not to equip it because that would soul bind it to me and I couldn't sell it. And that it would be very smart to store this in the bank and sell it in a couple months for 100+ because its an OP level 19 Twink item.
---
My small Runescape trained brain had 0 clue what a 19 twink was, but I talked to some of my friends who have played this game before and they said that doing what he said was actually a very smart thing to do. So after listening to them and the random, I did some research and figured out about twinks etc. and why it's worth so much. 
---
My no mount buying spoiled Paladin ass decided this would be the smart thing to do. I've since purchased 9 more of these from the Auction House. 6 for less than 3g and 3 for less than 2 g. 
---
Anybody here think its a worthy investment? I'm positive I will not lose money. If you wanted to, you could make 10g+ a day just flipping these in the AH. Some times i get on and theres 10+ of them all for more than 5g and some have bids. Then other times i log in and theres only 3 all for less than 2g a piece.
---
Very, very early in the game, Humans could speak to Undead.
---
I can't remember if there was a way to "cheat" and speak other languages when you weren't supposed to.
---
I recall there being a "plan" to be able to learn other languages but was later removed.
---
To switch between your "available" languages, you can simply run this:
---
```
---
/script local b,l,c,g=DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME.editBox,"languageID",GetNumLanguages,GetLanguageByIndex for i = 1,c() do local n,id = g(i) if id == b[l] then if i == c() then i = 0 end local nn,ni = g(i + 1) b[l] = ni print("Speaking "..nn) break end end
---
Just hold shift while looting to not auto loot. Can set the key in options.
---
Yea that’s because druids are fun to play for having every role but they are the worst at every role :(
---
Alliance or Horde
---
It's one of those things where people know from the game's history that druid won't be among the best DPS classes in classic, and warriors make better tanks than them. Lot of people thus maybe bit unfairly contribute to the general view that druids aren't that great.
---
So you have a whole lot of people seeing druids are mostly healers with a workable tank spec, and DPS specs that find more results in PvP rather than PvE.
---
Where would you be without water breathing right? 
---
Its okay no need to thank me, I do it for the children.
---
Why Ms at 42? Where do you have the two extra Skillpoints?
---
I think unemployed is implied in this situation.
---
Whenever I had trained my new rank I would give party members the old rank in stacks of 20 since it was cheap and fast to do
---
After P6 i hope they go a different route than retail and i dont mind that they add new items, dungeons and raids.
---
They just need to keep true to the original experience.
---
The groups i'm usually in, we ask who can open the chest by themselves. So rogues or people with keys. They can roll for a locked chest. We wouldnt have had it in the first place anyway if you can't open it. You might say they wouldnt have a chance without the group either. But the chest spawns randomly, so a nice extra for people who come prepared to open locked chests. But mostly when a rogue joins, and we tell him he can have it. He wants us to roll aswell. There are good guy/girl rogues aswell :)
---
The mage is named JokerD.
---
That's not magic, that's the basis of economy. Added Value.
---
Offtopic: what addon is telling you where to go ?
---
To be fair, him charging you at 25% health and 10% mana is the only way a warrior can stand a chance against a spriest.
---
But do you warp to the dance floor when that song comes on?
---
I meant 40, my bad. OP infected my mind with 42.
---
I went with the Icy Veins leveling build. Thanks for the help!
---
Retail WoW threw away RPG elements to try to make the game more approachable but made the game forgettable in the process. Additionally it added lots of 'theme park' elements that made the game feel like a part time job and not a game. 
---
If any developer is going to learn something, let it be that their game doesn't have to appeal to everybody to be successful. The only reason retail WoW exists is because people have been playing their accounts for several years. If BFA was a standalone game, retail would've shut down it's servers months ago.
---
Linen and wool are worth more raw than as bandages though.
---
Hunters like to roll on melee weaps for the stats, but they go bonkers if the warrior rolls on ranged weapons for stats too. If the Hunter is being a douche the warrior can play that game too, it works both ways
---
Horde/alliance?
---
Yo anybody got the horde message you have to type in for 'Go back to retail'?
---
Was on recent translated in the f00l site, but I can't seem to find it anymore
---
the instant heoric strike gives me rage 💯!
---
You do realise you need more ranged dps for Ony for phase 2? And also having heavy aoe for the Whelps? So stacking mages isn’t a uncommon thing and considering they are likely the most populated 60’s due to the leveling speed they are always plenty to find. They’ve always been good never broken their role is to DPS and that’s what they are good at.
---
Is BFA really that bad. I’ve not been on retail since mists of pandaria. Hence why I’m coming back to classic now
---
Well met
---
1) Crusader beats Righteousness pretty handily as far as raw DPS goes (especially since you can pick up Seal of Command from the retri tree and use Judgement on that seal if you need a burst of damage). To my knowledge, Rigtheousness is mostly used while tanking, since you can turn on the threat increase buff that makes your holy damage 70% more threatning
---
3) Honestly, investing into holy early is not required. You can heal just well by going full Retri and just keeping a piece or two of healing gear in your bags. Paladins in general don't have much downtime (since you can pop Crusader, whack a mob to death, Holy Light yourself once and go to the next guy and your mana regens to full naturally in the mean time).
---
4) Yes, you can buy bag slots in your bank that you can insert bags into. First slot costs 10 silver, second - 1g and higher from there
---
This is my first time playing wow, I tried retail up to about level 30 but once I realized the rest of the game was just gonna be spamming dungeon finder I quit, rip arcane blast tho. 
---
I've also made it to level 30 in classic but there's a substantial difference. 
---
Let me tell you what this game did to me, it redefined the word immersion. Every single MMO I've played says it's "immersive" and "breathtaking" and such. But when I play those games they dont feel that way so those words have never had any meaning to me. They are just games where u grind and u get stronger and u beat some bosses and that's fine I like that. 
---
But this game... It IS immersive, it is the definition of immersive. My proffesion is my job, I can literally sit in town and speak to actual humans and make bags for them and armor for them that they actually need, or enchant their gear. I need to go to another city, I can make the long trek there or I have to find a mage to make a portal for me there is no fast travel or shortcutting. When I'm done playing I go to the inn and type /lay on a bed before closing the game for resting exp and meme points. When I'm in a dungeon we discuss plans for how we are going to fight the next boss instead of just running through the dungeon as fast as humanly possible and killing everything as fast as we can, solo for the best loot of course.
---
I have never played a game this good in my life and I would recommend it to anyone and I hope to see more games with this level of dedication, heart, and soul poured into them.
---
Tanks love disc priests. It's power word shield that they hate.
---
Healing spec in classic is a mix of both trees, not one or the other.
---
As you progress further in the game and level up the dungeons will get harder, and thus require better healing. Technically you could play as a SP until 60 and still be decent at healing, as long as you have healing gear on you if needed. The point where holy/shadow really makes a difference is around the time you start hitting the 50+ dungeons. But IMO you should be fine as long as you have the right gear. And if you feel like you're not doing enough - you can always respec!
---
it's more being online at different times through out the day during the weekends and seeing nothing but dead chats and the population sitting at low. being a brand new server that was locked for the first 24 hours it was live so people could migrate over and only being available for 2 servers to transfer to it's pretty likely there isn't going to be a lot of people on it.
---
“Athene before he went insane” had me giggle there
---
Grinding mobs, killing mobs while traveling to and from quests. Always being in combat.
---
The external auction house API is disabled for classic so these types of site are not going to be highly accurate for classic.
---
I miss-read the last part of your comment due to your typo. The point still stands, there’s a tonne of content out there that many people will like to cover and to do so they will need to level various toons.
---
I haven’t said repeat the same thing at all, don’t twist my words. I said a possibility once you’ve covered all raid content post phase six could be to experience the World in a different way.
---
Easily entertained? Seems to me you are not really entertained by the game as a whole, and are only interested in raiding, and that’s fine. But it is the impatience and insistency for new ‘raid content’ that ruined WoW in the first place. I think you’d be better off playing retail considering it seems to be your drive.
---
The threshold in this screenshot is items with item quality Uncommon aka. greens.
---
What's even the point of this post?  Who the fuck cares who's better at wow?  Lmao
---
Somehow everyone is rushing. Im a healer and I had tanks rushing for the next fight. I call out oom, even made a makro for that, and he still rushes for the next mobs and we wipe. 
---
I thought classic is meant to be played for a few months. But somehow everyone wants to finish the game in 30 days.
---
is this the real life?
---
What version are you using or where did you find it? I can't seem to find a working version for classic, only for 1.12 :(
---
Pressing f1 targets yourself if you don't use macros
---
Priest: /cry
---
Don't they mean Amos?
---
I thought you were just drinking from your enemies skulls, Mount and Blade style.
---
Balance druid from literal day 2, I'm having very little issues at level 38 , I just got robes of the magi.
---
Where can I dance too for gold?
---
I think it just depends on the sort of group you get, also depending on the instance having a tank isn't the most important thing in the world. I had a group last night in BFD consisting of 3 locks, priest and a warr tank. For most of the run the tank was using fist and a shield (got to get that unarmed skill up) and we were just going full send on everything. Also party chat was pure gold!
---
You'd be surprised. My 38yr old friend is retired and plays, but hasn't played this much.
---
Did you manage to get the shadow wrath off hand? Ifffff so how many runs did you do?
---
Sir this is a Wendy's.
---
Literally went to BFD yesterday with 3 clothers, all of them were so excited to get the wand. It really is OP for the next 20 levels.
---
There's several reasons. One: layering options will be turned off, decreasing the capacity. Two: target realm isn't full enough so more base realms must be opened for transfer. This is a mayor reason for the german realms I would assume.
---
I Mind Control them and throw Fortitude on them.
---
People here have covered your questions regarding how to jump into the chat.  
---
Tip for soloing, try to outlevel your quest/the mobs in your area by 1-2 levels.  It makes a world of difference.
---
Wait is pack in Classic?
---
You're saying the joke clicked with you? :p
---
Never gonna give you up! Never gonna let you doooown!
---
Prior to playing I thought that WoW was only for no life virgins and then my step mom started playing so I figured “oh that’s not true” and she showed me the greatness of the horde... basically I farmed mobs for her while she cleaned the house and shit.
---
I eventually made a hunter (Tauren) and got it to lvl 43 (around BC era) the account got lost and I made my own account which I payed for. 
---
My older brother and sister started playing alliance but my sister quit after a few weeks and my bro and I joined a guild which we made some friends inside and talked to them regularly over ventrilo. After about 4 months these people got mad because I decided to rep farm instead of doing the previous expansions raids with them.... they failed and needed better dps is what they said and I wasn’t super good. I joined and noticed that our healers couldn’t keep us up and that was a big no no since the gm was our healer so I ofc started getting harassed and told “I wasn’t doing good enough” but I also didn’t wanna be there so I just left the group which my bro understood being in the same room and all but the guild was pissed... we both quit due to them not trying to listen or understand my side. We played for a bit longer and we both quit
---
Fast forward to the start of Cata
---
I made a forsaken hunter and decided to never go alliance again and my bro made a Tauren warrior. Pretty dope but we didn’t play together at this point (we used to quest together and use that Recruit a friend level boost) we hit lvl 85 and did a few of the low tier raids and some bgs but that’s about all.
---
I still play and have made more friends, ran a guild with a few friends and i still play horde... I regret nothing and I still kill on sight :)
---
Well written, bravo!
---
Yeah. Once I decided I wasn't going to be raiding that that much I figured skinning would just be better for fast cash while levelling as I have decided STV will be my path.  And since tailoring doesn't need a hinged profession. 
---
I levelled enchanting at 300 back in vanilla and will probably do it again once I ding 60.
---
Indeed, in fact if you top everyone off it will mean you are over-healing = wasting precious mana, and you cant afford that.
---
Warcraft 3, the first time smoke puffed out of the Spirit Lodge and I heard the words "Storm, earth and fire, heed my call." my fate was decided. 
---
Even more so when I did some spiritual research and unlocked Bloodlust. Shadow Hunter from Frozen Throne just sealed the deal even further.
---
this could be an animated movie ...
---
Why are people so dowright bitchy like this? Gee, you found one little inconsistency? Ask about it like a mature person. Might be a bug, might be a thousand different things other than blizzard personally trying to attack you by ruining your experience.
---
Phase 2 gonna be a bad time for alliance mains.
---
\*English Accent\* Oh, blast! Mind Cocks!
---
1) use Righteousness, crusader has a bit more DPS when auto attacking, but the judgement of it does nothing when only using crusader.
---
2) Haven't tried it myself but I've seen people recommend BuffWatch
---
3) You don't need to spec holy to heal dungeons, you just need some int/spirit gear to have more mana.
---
The healing specs make you around 20-30% more effective / efficient with healing, this is not necessary in 5 man dungeons.
---
4) Yeah, you can buy bank bag slots for increasingly higher prices, first one is 10s, second 1g, after that I don't know.
---
Yes, you have to first get out of your form. Hoewever this can be done faster using macros. Eg. /cancelaura Cat Form /cast Bear Form if you want to shift from cat to bear fast. Just keep in mind that you have to first cancel all possible forms before you do the cast bear form (travel, aquatic, and even bear form itself in case you want to break a root)
---
i've experienced this to an extent. i've gotten arcane int i think 8 times total from mages. druids are the friendliest and always buff the shit out of me
---
You guys convinced me, my small amount of guilt about getting a free mount while warriors dont is totally gone.
---
they dont despawn, prolly they spawn and do wonderful things on another layer. lol.
---
Is it a dick move for the sole herbalist in the group to take all the herbs?
---
"im a twitchie boi and we run the gaming world!"
---
Thanks for your insight :)
---
You are beyond deluded if you think 3 months was enough time for naxx.
---
It'll be clearly by far more people in classic. Most people didn't even both with naxx because TBC was already announced.
---
I only roll on stuff which gives me any plus in dmg output. If not I only greed. Be nice with others fellow hunters.
---
Me and my friends went there yesterday, started off at level 22 and all of us ended at 24/25. It's doable at this level, except it'll take you quite a while since the mobs go up to level 27 (fucking resist everything) and killing the last boss is a pain in the ass (we couldnt kill him in the end) cause he's level 29. My suggestion would be to go there at level 24, as long as you have a couple of 26's and/or you level up a level or two while there you should be fine.
---
those instant bg pops later on though
---
Well, if they feign death, they might NOT die so taking the line " If the DPS die, it's their fault. " it means it is not their fault :P
---
Thing is, most of those warriors won’t reach 60.
---
Priests? I’d say a lot more would die to ease of leveling. But even then there are a lot of viable healers. 
---
Warrior is pretty much gonna be your go to for tanking and arguably the hardest/most tedious  class to level. Lot of people will give up without help from their friends or guildies. 
---
My bet is warrior
---
I’m not even level 17 yet
---
Druids are excelent at leveling, probably the second best class (behind hunter and ahead of Druid). Self sustain with heals, damage that doesn't eat mana (since you're in either Bear or Cat form), buffs, Travel form at 30.
---
The bad rep for druids comes from the tail end of the game, where  Balance (boomkins i.e. LAZOR BIRDS) are weak and mana starved, Bears being tanks that can't hold aggro and cats generally being behind rogues in raw DPS (though they're still quite good). I mean, you got Innervate, so people will want you in regardless.
---
HUMAR THE PRIDELORD! 
---
He holds a very special place in my heart. 
---
As a 12 year old playing in Vanilla I sought this majestic beast, sitting at that tree for a good half of my week.  Of course after patiently putting in the hours another hunter shows up and he spawns 10 minutes later... then we began the taming fight. 
---
I didn’t know how or why (he was a few levels above me) but I ended up getting the tag and this guy tried to KILL humar so I couldn’t get him. 
---
14 years later “Shadow” is proudly still in my stables on my untouched level 70 retail hunter.
---
I’m a ud priest, helped a dwarf kill bag’Thera the other day
---
Was gonna kill him though
---
PVP queue times won't matter. It's cross-realm PVP so when queue you will be queueing for the same battleground that someone on another server is trying to join as well. Someone could be Nat Pagle(Hugely alliance dominated) and queue for a BG and the queue will be exactly the same as another alliance player on a server where they are greatly outnumbered.
---
It could make World PVP very difficult to get honor kills in Phase 2 before the BG's come in Phase 3.
---
The same can be applied to herbs and mining nodes, should those also be given equally to everyone in the group?
---
I think in dungeons it's pretty viable. The longer the fight, the bigger your mana problems, but even in longer fights you can weave a few downranked lightning bolts in an fish for clearcasting. It takes a bit more work getting it right than other classes but it's definitely possible. A raid fight takes simply to much time, so your mana problems take to much of a toll.
---
Similar experience although without the family aspect. Played horde, had a lot of fun. Friend got me to try alliance. Guild and general populace sucked. Stayed in horde.
---
Such a beautiful face!
---
Benediction has a pretty equal ratio compared to most US PvP servers.
---
There's no US PvP server with a heavy alliance bias. Only horde.
---
I miss WOTLK DK.
---
Clases since have felt like rogues with increased mobility.
---
Yeah, the classic "bitch move hiding behind a shit meme because you're not even man enough to own that what you're doing is a bitch move"
---
Aka the horde on ever server.
---
You’re right I’ve had this with quite a few mobs. Tells me to loot but nothing shows up
---
Yep, picked this server exactly for those reasons
---
imho warrior vs priest is a quick fight if you don't press the wrong buttons
---
I just used the one i had for BFA. Its not current version tho
---
Well shit, guess I'm a bad hardcore then cause I'm not close to 60 and it's my 3rd week
---
A hunter however can need on pretty much anything mail and under after 40.
---
BGs are cross realm.
---
ironic
---
Ah which crafts are valuable? generally curious. Did you cop any rare recipes?
---
Incredible
---
Yea, sorry.
---
The Barrens. There's a great spot just south kf the Crossroads.  Can get about 5g in 3 mins at level 1i.
---
See you there!
---
If you roll a warlock just for that particular reason then good luck to you reaching Lv 60.
---
Vanilla was a game. The other expansions were a story
---
So you can fast run away in a battle?
---
that was the idea, dont u have to reset the instance for the mobs to respawn?
---
Haven't had the problem with having to lay there. You feign, trap comes out, get up. Personal experience. Results may vary.
---
&gt;I miss-read the last part of your comment due to your typo. 
---
Which typo? Serious question, I am trying to improve my language skills.
---
&gt;Easily entertained? Seems to me you are not really entertained by the game as a whole, and are only interested in raiding, and that’s fine. But it is the impatience and insistency for new ‘raid content’ that ruined WoW in the first place. I think you’d be better off playing retail considering it seems to be your drive.
---
No, what I want is new content in general. Besides the fact that I already playing 90% of the offered content back in vanilla there is also not exactly a lot of truly interesting stuff for me. I don't care about quests, for example (especially not when they are as bad as they are in vanilla).
---
Telling people to basically just do the same thing again but different is not going to work.
---
theres just no way that adults are sitting there spamming
---
OMEGALUL
---
MONKAS
---
and i didnt say that guy is an asmonkid, the guy commenting to me did.
---
My favorite is when everyone’s just having a laugh like that, then the person gquits and the laugh goes even further. Then months later someone says barrance and everyone dies all over. Those are the good times.
---
Im 38, 60 Gold. Ally Priest in Kirtonos.
---
First, i'm considering switching to full shadow (im running Disc Shadow for meditation)
---
But my real question is were i can farm the 15g/level that im missing. I'm torn between farming in SM Cath, Questing in Arathi or just farming greys in SoS or Elementals in Arathi
---
What should i do?
---
They just opened up more server to transfer to that server so maybe that helps out.
---
Always buff and heal randoms in world, Ive been playing support classes for about 20 years and still enjoy helping strangers. Especially warriors in classic, from what I've seen and played my own warrior a bit, they seem like a bit of an ass to level solo specially at the lower levels. 
---
If theres a warrior questing near me I always keep them in my view in case they pull extra mobs or they pull something a bit too high level for them. Hamstring + run away is a great escape but u have to do it early enough as sometimes it seems the mobs can still melee you from like 10 meters away lol
---
Self cast button = ALT
---
By default at least.
---
I would burn the alliance one
---
Imagine being dumb enough to gank a spriest solo as a warrior. But all in all great post. Thoroughly enjoyed reading that.
---
Not great, not terrible.
---
I only recently started playing WoW and have noticed this nosense..
---
What's wrong with these sorts of people? Sure my experience is anecdotal, but man they're annoying.
---
Did he touch your ass?
---
Man, you had us in the first half 😂
---
Run BFD and get the wand there, I used mine until I was 46.
---
I was late at swapping it out as I was grinding dungeons and hardly needed it though.
---
If you are leveling as shadow doing quests, find a wand progression list and get the best wand you can for your level.
---
You're so right. 
---
Now things are getting too spread. We're at risk of too many low pop servers. They should have waited a couple more weeks before doing something like this.
---
How, did you farm them yourself or buy?
---
No try and get 19'99'99
---
Humans do have the best jokes
---
Dwarves and undead do too
---
How are you calculating HPM? My tooltips don't change with more plus healing equipped
---
My first character was an undead frost mage on the server Kel’Thazad.  I knew since WoW was announced that that is what I would play.  I don’t really play mages anymore, I fell in love with Tanking, but it settled my position in the Horde forever.
---
Looks unwieldy and uncomfortable to drink out of, also look like a pain to wash. Absolute tat, how much were they?
---
I don't like sand. It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.
---
Yes, summaries exactly what happend.
---
Level 28 here, still using the Crescent staff - expecting to head to RFK today. I think RFK is higher level in classic, level 29+ - or so most people have told me. I seem to recall doing it at 27 in WotLK, but 29 is not a problem. 
---
I wouldn't go with a 1h+shield as long as I have a decent 2h. Especially not after 30.
---
What ?
---
Today in Desolace I was opened up on by an Alliance feral Druid.  (I’m an undead warlock)
---
Right when the fight began I looked  around and noticed a dwarf hunter in the “??” Level range riding his mount toward me and the Druid. At this moment I thought to myself “oh great I’m screwed” expecting the hunter to protect his allied brethren.
---
But he just watched.
---
It was amazing, He wanted to see how the fight played out. 
---
Even after killing the Druid he gave me a 
---
/cheer and  /clap which I followed with a 
---
/bow.
---
Good dude. I aspire to be like that hunter.
---
Only bullets but there is a repeatable quest to trade thorium shells for thorium headed arrows in IF and Orgrimmar. no trades for the lower end bullets though.
---
&gt;Flying and group finder are the two worst things to ever happen to the game IMO. 
---
This was still for the server only back then, not for many servers with nobody saying a word (like in cataclysm, which i hated, which is why i quit).
---
&gt;Vanilla WoW is peak WoW.
---
1 actual tank? no role beyond healing (in raids) for basically any class that was able to heal?
---
Don't get me wrong, I love vanilla, but the way the classes/talents were done was not the best.
---
HA! The horde would never drink out of something like that. They would drink out of something much less civilized like a clay cup or a hide canteen or their own hands.
---
How does he do it?
---
I crafted myself an Azure Silk Hood, I swiftly took it off again after seeing what it looked like.
---
It’s also great to use charge on a critter, get the hit and refresh battle shout with the rage you get.
---
This is the only thing im worried about. But it does make since that the supply is so high considering 98% of players have ran the dungeon in the past week. The supply will go down over a couple of months, but who knows how much. My best bet is to probably sell them on the Phase 2 or Phase 3 release. Or to spread them out between the both of them.
---
ITT: People complaining about no movement speed buffs for warriors and literally no one mentioning the +8% movespeed to boots enchant.
---
What was your name?
---
Wow, the aggression. Who hurt you? As I said, hunters are meleeing plenty while leveling. Warriors don't range. So your argument is very invalid.
---
Can confirm am 15 now and the voidwalker can't hold aggro against two dots and wand.  If I start at max distance and he taunts at the right time I usually don't get hit much, but it's far from having your own personal tank.
---
Well i pick alliance because :
---
-I hate undead and I will make sure that they diedededed for good
---
-I'm a generic non fantasy scrub that always pick humans in rpg. And dwarf because thicc.
---
....
---
JK, those things are kinda true to some extent but I really enjoy RP as a 'good' warlock sacrificing my body and fighting to keep my sanity for the survival of the alliance and all of the People in it.
---
Because everyone needs the blue BoE gun from the chest?
---
I fished in dustwallow last night with no issues, any details on the forums as to where / what servers this happening on?
---
You posted this earlier didn’t you?
---
The face ruins it.
---
I hope you had downranked fear.
---
They're under their own heading, but im unsure if Elv is bugged, every time i make a change to the buffs/debuffs tab it reverts them back to default after a relog.
---
Even though I’m horde, I can agree that the undead should stay dead... stupid EK starting fucks 😛
---
Rogues, warriors, and mage are top dps.
---
Spotted the horde
---
My favorite hunter pet from vanilla.  Not playing a hunter this time around but if I did I would have him in a heart beat. Have gotten a hunter to lvl 13 but I need to get my main to 60 but eventually I will get humar on her.
---
Haha that's nice :) I'm looking forward to doing silly stuff when I get a bit higher level
---
Its not mine but ye haha
---
Plot twist, the wand one shots them
---
I don't think so?
---
Im full 14slot bags, 2 from quests and 1 i bought for 2.5g from AH. Last slot is SS bag.
---
Now 16 slot bags... 30+g is abit much for 2 extra slots.
---
Originally langauges were supposed to be learnable like any other skill and Undead actually started with common.
---
Except it almost exclusively got used to insult and grief cross faction so undead lost common and trainable language was never implemented.
---
I very do
---
very
---
Are you expected to hand out free Bandages to your group if you have First Aid?
---
   If you have cooking and got a well fed recipe, are you expected to keep your party well fed throughout the dungeon?
---
   Doing these things is a nice gesture for sure, but do people actually expect this of their fellow group members?
---
This is why hunters are the most hated class.
---
Im only in it for world PvP, PvP and some raiding so the casual questing and lore I can skip if possible. Thats why I look for addons to remove the extra effort when questing.  
---
I will use the Questie addon for the map perks tho.
---
Not when there's a bunch of other twinks to compete in. Competing against "normal" players gets boring really fast. It's quite refreshing to play a game that doesn't make all your gear and time investment irrelevant every few months.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Are you sure you just went used to seeing no cast bars without addons? I don't see how that would even be possible
---
38 and retired?! How..! Tell me his secret!
---
For me it's pumpkin bags or nothing.
---
Basically the plan was originally to just keep adding content to vanilla wow, but then they decided expansions were a better model.
---
Is it a dick move for the healer not to res someone who dies? Lockpick is a class ability, not a profession
---
Yes, it was in 1.12 vanilla too, so no point in starting #nochanges.
---
:D I love being good guy Greg - giving potions, silver and buffs to random people. I'm paladin anyway so don't need gold as much as others
---
Earlier i was lv35!
---
Yah ill take some as well, maybe like half of whatever you took though i dont wanna trip as hard as you are right now.
---
Huh, TIL. Why do I never see warriors using it tho? Is it because people don't know better?
---
spider pets have no unique abilities in vanilla tho, idk why u mention them
---
They want the dps, it's not something they can help it seems.
---
I personally play with a rogue and a mage, both of which are terrible at letting me get the last hit. The rogue will eviscerate and mage will fireblast when mobs are low.
---
The best thing you can do is try to mindblast everytime you see a mob at around 10%HP.
---
There is unfortunately very little you can do about this with PUGs\No voice.
---
You can TRY to mark a target when they should stop attacking it, but again, PUGs are less likely to follow such instructions. If the reason you want spirit tap is to save yourself time drinking, you can start drinking for the first 5-10 seconds of each encounter, because nobody needs heals during the first few seconds of a pull.
---
My experience as a 50priest
---
If you are horde you get a quest for bloodscalp clan heads to kill the 2 names guys at the top. You gotta do a tusk quest and a headhunter shrunken head quest beforehand.
---
Several of the things written in the OP is flat out impossible. The troll can't have tried frost nova, the mobs are not aggressive to them. The warrior can not have tried intidimating shout, the mobs are not aggressive to them. They could cast the spells, literally nothing would happen, and the guards would not aggro on them. The druid and the priest would most likely not have gotten aggro either.
---
A mage randomly strolled in, threw arcane intellect on players clearly being murdered by guards? Sure.
---
This story is fake. Things he say literally doesn't work.
---
Nope not Druids we also have a sprint for cat form so we pop sprint when you do then just press travel form again.
---
Glorious
---
I just hit 60 yesterday and my played time was 7 days and 5 hours
---
You can also find Chen Stormstouts keg in the southern barrens.
---
I think it may well be worth buy them at a slight uptick in the AH. After some level you just start making so much money that those 20-50s upticks people put on recipes really aren't too bad.
---
My cat barks and growls tough. XD
---
"Tantrum culture" is slightly more accurate.

You (Horde) say a c ‚ c ÇÈ ‚ f 30 and Alliance will read g o t o re t a il
---
I'm not super annoyed about it but I do feel like it was a neat part of the game to walk into an area that was being ganked and see the skeletons piled up and realize oh shit. It made pvp servers feel more dangerous and gave you advanced warning shit was going on. Not a HUGE deal but ...would rather have it like it was
---
I had no idea that was even a thing!
---
Jep, got multiple chars on horde side, moved there end of Vanilla. Main was Nõid, guild: Kalevlased.
---
Now playing Ten Storms and Shazzrah. Shazz has bad queues right now so during the week can only play low pop server :(.

Is BDE Big Dick Energy? Nice

aaaah yer nice

Not a bug
---
I am not sure where you van get 15g/hr at this level excluding dungeons, the chance to ding 40 before getting these 15g is high in a dungeon.  
---
As a rogue with skinning I went in STV and farmed the basilisk near the coast, its located north west.  
---
Farming for an hour resulted in roughly 7g including selling the skins and any trash, but thats me skinning the beasts, I assume you don't have skinning. Someone else might have a better approach.
---
That's incredible that you have such deep insight into Blizzard's inner workings. Please, tell us more.
---
TL;DR of how it happened was, I logged in on-top of the orgrimmar bank and was jumping around. Then after i jumped inbetween the edge of the wooden beams that connect to the center of the roof it seems to have bugged me out. It's making the game impossible to play properly since nothing seems to fix it. Can't see a way to submit a ticket for these kinds of issues either and have  GM come look, all I could do was submit a bug report.  
---
Also, this is not client-side only. Other players can see me stuck in jump animations happens on mount as well.
---
56 nug for a mug??????

The only good Horde is a dead Horde.
---
I got a hall pass for the first week and hit 45. It’s been slower going since then w/ being back at work and actually acknowledging my family exists but I’m getting there.
---
It's very valid for the exact reason as he already mentioned. My guess on this is that you are hurt because someone rolled on a ranged weapon and you lost ;-)
---
Setting up BT is super easy and does not take long. As far as setting up an addon goes, it's probably the most self-explanatory and simple thing I've dealt with.
---
elite pets still have same stats. only difference Pets can have is different attack speeds, and that doesnt depend on it being elite or not.
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/ here is a nice website if anyone wants some overview
---
Yeah I wanted to go Horde at first since j always played alliance but then I remembered *orange, yellow and rock brown* and decided to go for a Night Elf.
---
I was hoping they would allow transfers from Noggenfogger to Earthcrusher so I could play with my friends that stuck it out on Firemaw. I guess I will have to wait for paid transfers, which is totally fine with me, I just hope they open up sooner rather than later.
---
But.. It has nothing useful to hunters.. Slap him.
---
A rogue took a locked chest in SM without rolling, everyone else had rolled. I booted him out, no question. You may don that mask to shroud your face, but boi, get outta here. 
---
His name was almost the same as Lancel from GoT, leading to some Bobby B quotes about his mother from a buddy of mine. 
---
Didn’t blast his name, but I’ll be wary when it comes to rogues from now on.
---
tbh the price isnt that bad if theyre handmade or made with expensive material. art is a luxury, afterall. also im not sure if fan creations fall under copyright violation or not, i know a lot of people create and sell wow themed art/crafts so if blizzard truly saw it a problem theyd do something. plus id rather my 68 dollars go to an independent artist than blizz.
---
Never said I will need your blue 2H. But the argument was that melee weapons for hunters are just stat sticks. They are not. Hunters have actual melee abilities training, they have talents for their melee attacks and the perfect hunter rotation also uses melee weaving between autoshots. Perhaps you hate hunters because you believe the internet too much and you haven't actually paid attention to the class.
---
Yeah, OP got a nice imagination!
---
Just to give argument to why I call it fake, the guards were not aggressive to the mage so frost nova would just have hit nothing and he would not have gotten aggro.
---
Cheers, thanks for the update. Been a while since I played a hunter on vanilla.

I assume you went pvp because of friends. Gods speed

My cat at 3am
---
Imagine playing an all nighter, all I get is 1.5 hours maximum per session
---
Might consider a shift from questing leveling to running dungeons. Better gear drops and aside from the walk to them, no chance of getting ganked inside. Also I'd find a decent sized guild that promotes leveling as well as end game stuff. Safety in numbers!
---
he just needed layering abuse because he was getting grieved by some who wanted to fuck with him. by switching layers he could avoid interferences.
---
yes layering helped with respawn, but not as much as you think. he did the same thing a few times on privat servers without layering too and always was under 3days played.
---
most of the mage aoe grindspots have a quick respawn anyway. if you are alone its always enough to chainpull

I did capture 2 Ressan the Needler last week, first one i waited for 2 hours for him to spawn then like a dumbass i misspelled his nickname and i was so frustrated that i waited for another 2 hours to get another one.

Ps: I'm a troll hunter so it was easier for me than to be alliance.
---
You got the leaping AIDS, F
---
-There is no mt, unless there is a bear druid in the party. The more damage you take the more rage :)  Occasionally kite if you take to much damage. Taunt things off of healer/squishy in party.
---
- Generally you want to use whirlwind as much as possible to proc your ravager, so it has second highest priority. Highest priority is to keep spinning if you already are. Battle shout and demo shout also have top priority.
---
- For maximum efficiency you want to rotate retalliation + challenging shout on big pulls. When you do, stay in battle or even defensive stance.. Otherwise it's always berserker.
---
- Your "rage dump" abilities are mortal strike, cleave and execute.. Use what is appropriate for the situation.
---
Remember that a lot of allies know that horde tend to be more thirsty and just camp uld  zf  mara for the mid 40s low 50s. Whitemane isn't super imbalanced but as an ally i can say walking out of booty bay makes me feel like one of Stannis' guys
---
It seems more likely that my memory fails me on this detail! I think it's level 5, though, for learning the profession - but otherwise I believe you are in the right. Edited my OP.
---
Ive seen people walking around like this, i thought i was witnessing them lag lol
---
warrior for tanking 
---
rogue/warrior/mage for dps
---
priest for healing
---
shaman for buffs and AoE heals
---
Tailoring and also I planned on skinning quite a bit before dropping to take engineering, essentially farm as much till I'm burnt out
---
I know it will be expensive and a decent grind but I don't plan on making any alts want this toon to be the best it can be for PVP
---
I would expect nothing more.
---
Would love to know this, swear it used to do this aswel?
---
You probably didn't focus on getting spirit :)
---
Stoneform is a rogues best friend since it let's them stealth when they otherwise couldn't because of DoTs. And don't downplay shadow meld either, it drops threat from pets, clears you as a target and lets you do things that require you to be it of combat to do like res or mount up, and the ganking/camping potential is insane. Shadowmeld has the most utility in the whole game.
---
Hardiness, while really good, only has one function and it's completely RNG if/when it goes off.
---
Brand new to this game. Really enjoying it so far. I started playing with some friends last week. They have since stopped but I still play a bit every day. I noticed that I am on a normal server and not a PVP server. Am I missing out on a lot of the game? Should I restart on a PVP server?
---
Step one: don't be poor.
---
I seen it happen in certain areas on bits of terrain, but for me my character is totally bugged now and it's happening everywhere.
---
Yeah that’s the issue. I was thinking human starting area - Ironforge - loch maden. Must better routes though
---
Some my colleagues in roguecraft already on your realm hoarding all day long
---
... screenshot?
---
That's called an investment. You buy low, sell high. Later on when honor and bgs come in twinks will slowly raise the price. Then you sell, your 3g turns into 19g, or 20g.. maybe more.
---
The Dad Who Melts Faces!
---
I did spec into it - ran some SM cath aoe spams shortly after. I have a good amount of +healing gear and my renew is much more effective now. I will typically use it  right after using one of the cast heals that way I can go longer without casting again for mp5 regen. 
---
Whether it is more worth to spend the points elsewhere, I am still undecided.
---
“Collectors expansion”. Does that include vanilla? If not, no pet.
---
You can’t. But that’s why he was shot. If you’re gonna charge a priest or warlock you should swap to zerker as you reach them.
---
Common sense isn't so common I see.
---
Don't make any decisions based on raiding.  Play the class you enjoy.  Even if you don't get to raid, you will still have 60 levels worth of questing and 5 mans to enjoy, and Blizzard are very possibly going to re-release TBC as well.
---
I consciously made a controversial decision; I don't want to raid at all.  I'm going to spend time instancing and levelling up the different classes, and will take my time and really get to know the game again and enjoy it.  I don't need to pretend that end game content is all there is, because there are nine classes across two factions.  It will take me a long time to get all of them to max level.
---
Not until phase 2
---
Addon list plx?
---
This is Brazilian candy.  BIS means ‘another.’  The idea is that when you eat one, you need another.
---
As a hunter......I absolutely agree. Too many people are trying to treat Classic like retail and chain pull the entire instance, resulting in wipes and then blaming other people. Hunter is a great class, but people who try to be top of the damage meters just jeopardise the whole team. I'd take someone who does less damage that saves the healer and uses crowd control over someone obsessed with top numbers any day. People also forget that hunter isn't all about damage, they have large amounts of utility......so use it and help the team.
---
god I hate that skill
---
More believable
---
I'd say a slight edge to caster but debatable since the int at that level is quite decent but obviously we make no use of agility. Also from what I remember i never once had a ring equipped when running DM so you have that issue where even the warrior would be like omg 2 agility. Again I would not be bothered losing that ring unless of course they had rings eqipped
---
Doesn’t the quest cost a bunch ?
---
Why didn't you ask the hunter for lead ? Explain to him why you where wiping and what can be done about it.  Hunter is an easy class to step into and that means new players or very very casual players are likely to choose that class. You generalized it to a point where you didn't put in the effort to teach the hunter how dungeons work.
---
Also, you wouldn't likely be making a post on how good the other hunter was. I've never seen a post like that. Its only the bad or inexperienced that deserve to bashed and shamed. And of course it's more likely to be hunter to make faults because as I said its an easy class to step into. Hunters also have alot to think about the pet which in of itself is a whole minigame which is attractive to casual gamers.
---
I've played hunter my whole life. Vanilla to WotLK and 3pservers.  Its people like you who make these post that create the stigma and give us a bad reputation. I can't tell how many times I got rejected from groups for being a hunter. Just a hunter... Once I've had to chance to prove my worth they give me compliments and appreciation but if people only make posts like this about the negative it bad experience then it doesn't help for the class. Next time instead teach him or give the name of the previous hunter so he can improve.
---
And to be fair if you're tired and start another WC run then things could easily tilt you.
---
Seems to only be feralas for me. Every other zone i have tried is fine
---
It's worth checking the AH occasionally to see what ores/bars do and don't sell.
---
I've found that copper through bronze isn't worth it on my server, but Iron Bars sells for 1-2g a stack. Silver and gold ores sell well as well (they keep giving skill points for smelting for quite a while).
---
Your mileage may vary, but I would definitely check if there's exceptions to the 'vendor what you gather' rule.
---
For alliance its about Uthers tomb in WPL
---
Really? I always had the opposite feeling. Edgelord undeads and stuff
---
Hahaha, I am in a similar situation, although we usually watch some movie/TVshow before she dozes off on a couch and then I proceed to tiptoe over to the computer. Feel like a kid slipping off to a party at night.
---
False,
---
That was so infuriateting I a whole 2 liter of coke
---
But questing is the game for quite a while
---
always roll once when creating a new char, if the roll is under 90 the char is bugged and needs to be replaced.
---
delete and try again

This ring is 300g on my server... I’d say thats closer to epic mount than I was before

Just to chime in, I have a video of this. I may just open a ticket to ask about the report and provide them with the video if their checks (if there were any) didn't yield any results.

Ah I see. Yeah that argument is kind of a paradox even if being tired of complains is legitimate on its own.

I am a paladin and I was doing a dungeon with another paladin. I figured we should both put on different blessings on everyone because why not, right? I put on one blessing and then I asked, "Hey can you throw blessing of wisdom on the others?"
---
He replied, "sorry i dont have that one." I was in shock so i didnt say anything but I asked my guild if I was crazy, to which someone replied," He probably left it in the bank" in a very serious manner.
---
Someone please explain to me if I am crazy or not because how did this paladin not have a level 10 spell in his late 20s.
---
Both sides do it. I don't know why we try to play the victim. 
---
In searing gorge yesterday I got ganked by a two-man group, then later a level 60 warrior.
---
Almost every time I get ganked solo it's when I have low Mana/health.
---
Hell, same situation in Searing Gorge this nelf priest was questioning in the Slag Pit doing his thing I was doing my thing, we ignored each other. Then when I'm soloing the cultists for the Mark of Rag (elites that makes me use almost 100% of my mana for each kill), that same nelf comes up to me and tries to Mana burn me for a easy kill. I fear him and get away, but then he tried to do the same to a druid who was also soloing. Me and him hunted that nelf down.
---
Noone will see your screen in worldchat. Wich is the point. Worldchat. Not forums
---
says who? the numbers are far too massive for it to be only old returning players...
---
Ayee
---
You don’t need to have a the correct category when opening a ticket, the GM will just redirect you to the right GM.
---
oh
---
Right, so that's all about the looks here, cool why not! But as for the statistics and number gains had to actually look elsewhere. Gameplay wise I kinda liked [this armor guide](https://mmoauctions.com/news/wow-classic-armor-sets-what-will-you-get-for-clearing-molten-core) where each set is marked with the numbers. So right from the get go it's easy to see there what's viable and what's not.
---
Your hunter was clueless. He will swap that with the first random of the monkey he finds.
---
I don't think that it's a bug, i have a vague memory of the infernal shit being fixed before 1.12 back in the day.

Tradeskill Master

As a former warrior who decided to roll priest for classic, I am absolutely guilty of this. You think I wouldve put two and two together but oh well. Live and learn
---
THUNDER THUNDER CATS HOOOOOOOOOO
---
Op-  your computer should be able to run classic.
---
So sounds like excuses, you get xp, and drops are fine with a group. If you don’t like it then transfer to small server. The point of a large server is the people
---
You can find it all over the Barrens, it starts a quest to bring it to Ratchet. Once someone picks it up it spawns at another random location in the Barrens
---
Surprisingly kromcrush is apparently mostly alliance. Feels not much different to me than playing on illidan on retail
---
&gt;Then there's GLOBAL channels such as world/LFG
---
I've been looking for a global channel since I started. Do all realms have them/ what are they called? Is it /global or /world or...?
---
i was only 4 when i met my most important friend. a tauren kid - the first tauren i met and he was alone.
---
he was already 5. he never talked much and never said a word about his family. 
---
until we became 7. he told me about those dwarfs invading his home some time ago.
---
he doesnt know what happened to his family, his old friends. his mother told him to run and he did. 
---
when he came back, everything he knew was gone. dead bodies everywhere. 
---
listening alone filled me with rage. i cant even imagine what he must feel.
---
at 16 he received a letter. a group of members of his tribe gathered and decided to go for a revenge 
---
attack. i tried to stop him - but i wasnt able to - then i offered assissting and he declined. he forbid
---
me to help. but he told me where they decided to attack. 
---
i waited until i was 17 to go and look for him. dead bodies. dead bodies everywhere. is this how it looked
---
like when he went back to check for his old village? is what i asked myself..
---
then i saw him. or what was left of him. his body... in pieces. 
---
the dwarfs they decided to attack got help from human garbage. his tribe didnt stand a chance. 
---
i got angry. not just angry- furious. i couldnt stop myself from screaming. i swore to kill every single
---
alliance i come across no matter the cost.
---
my tauren friend and his tribe stood no chance - i dont care in what situation the alliance members are
---
when i meet them. i will engage. i will kill. death is what i will bring. their death is all i see.
---
honor isnt what i seek. revenge is. for my tauren friend. 
---
you will be remembered.
---
Are you selling tapes here in Hong Kong?
---
I'll check it out thanks! I think lenovo is also on the cheaper side.
---
Imagine writing a post this long for an early dungeon, where tanking doesn't matter.
---
No way these people grinded fire resistance gear. They came right out of UBRS probably and just nailed it in an evening.
---
This is all I do, I just walk around looking for someone doing something and heal them, fight their tagged mob, try to give them bags if they are in the opening 10 levels, etc.
---
I understand that, as I mention in previous comments, the difference is whats going on around you, when 3 - 4 people are killing mobs around you it is very easily to miss x person went stealth.. Then surprise gank.. the addon feels cheap to use.
---
I was told that not being able to sheep a mob already tagged by someone else used to be a thing in vanilla.
---
I used to run here for safe heaven whenever i was ganking SW or playing the Alphabet game
---
And I made a typo in the title, rip.
---
I spent literally 20 minutes opening the instantly respawning strongboxes on the ship next to Ratchet to get up to 75 skill. I don't know where the next place like that is, so I can believe it.

New to wow hunter here, was recommended to play hunter as I am new to wow, easiest leveling, good first hero, but I’ve watched and seen what I’m supposed to do in dungeons and I know to dismiss pet, not pull until tank needs a second to breathe. As for the “not waiting for mana” I’m almost always oom. I sip waters more than the mages do. If anything almost all of the warriors/tanks I’ve gone into dungeons with are just like “fk my team im going in solo.” I can see where a bad hunter would give you this bad taste but as a new hunter attempting to fix this stigma (atleast for my own name) what are some things I should/shouldn’t be doing?
---
Try Swamp of Sorrows
---
So in that case (of nobody has a ring), why would the warrior (omg 2 agi) not be a retard but the hunter would?
---
Completely.
---
The modern world is all about analytical statistics.
---
Game developing, like music or writing use to be a form of art.
---
But now companies look at a graph and see everyone is spending money on moblie games (probably because theres more ppl with phones than computers in the world and everybody poops)
---
So they think based of analytical stats that we enjoy moblie fast AFK do it for me games so they make every video game just like a moblie game.
---
You wont see that "Soul" in product or service until the human race evolves beyond being stupid monkeys who think an invention of theirs gives them power.
---
Theres a popular saying right now.
---
"You create a business to make money." 
---
And that's the problem with the modern world.
---
Why all food tastes same. Why all music sounds the same. Why all movies feel the same. Why all video games are the same.
---
You create a business to provide a service/product.
---
If the modern world can get back to that mentality...you'll see that soul you mentioned.
---
I think phase 3 or 4 are more likely. Twinks won’t become a thing until phase 3 at the earliest (not to say players won’t start making them before hand to have them ready for release of BGs).  Either way, it’s a safe assumption that these maces will be worth more than what you’ve invested already.
---
You never seen a puma on those trees, didn't they grow there?
---
Keep in mind that there are always more slots in a raid for the more 'popular' classes. Mages for example, are really popular, but you can expect somewhere around 8-10 of them in a 40 man raid. There may only be a couple of slots open for druids.
---
I've started this discussion in my guild. It seems that your way of thinking is the dominating one. I don't hold the same view. If you were in there with a group of IRL friends, and only one friend could use this piece with the intention to actually use it, would you let him have the piece to wear or would you still want everyone to roll for it?
---
Free version only has Leveling guides from 1-12
---
Paid has Leveling guides 12-60
---
I found STV quite pleasant in the 30-40 bracket. People dying around me while I just chill in cat form. I swear I could tell when someone had thoughts of ganking me, but lost interest when they realized I could run away immediately with travel form
---
u cant swap in combat tho, like the old itemrack u would be able to "buffer" the item swap b4 u leave combat and as soon u leave combat u would equip the pressed item. Buuut maybe  thats just for me.. and sometimes items u wanna swap to dont even show up in the list
---
&gt; When things are 'fair' then there is no emotional stake. A loss just means a very quick release and then you are back into the action.
---
To be fair, being ganked also means that. A quick release and then you're back into the action, It might not be the action you want. But it's the action you get.
---
Why stop there? Send their username to your closest police department as well. We should have the plague of society publicy executed to set an example for others.
---
As a priest that always plays PvE servers, respect! I hated that stuff when I tried it before, give them h3ll!
---
Great story! Welcome to the dark side.
---
The problem is just as much as the joke is everything is a hunter weapon, everything is simultaneously NOT a hunter weapon except for ranged weapons pre-40s. Then after ranged weapons get stats we can just eat shit. Hell, we run the risk of pissing shamans off with certain leather and mail drops because they don't feel hunter enough.
---
For now, just enjoy the game and learn by yourself. Much more fun that way, at 60 maybe look up some pvp guides etc and see how their playstyle differs from yours.
---
avoiding aggro etc, I dont like loss of control of my character.
---
Can't attack them unless you check the "At War" first. A new player won't have done that. A veteran won't either, but they at least know of the possibility. The veteran however, won't jump in with frost nova.
---
Boo! OP deleted it! They shouldn't feel so bad.
---
I want to know this story turned out okay, OP is now best mates with the high schooler, and now he's the best healer he's ever been, loving it and enjoying raiding even more than before.
---
Because mayb . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . nna be the one that save meeeeeee.

It's a classic rum ham.
---
A druid just up and gave me 8 Burning Charms from the elementals in Arathi when he saw I was a warrior and waiting for spawns. Didn't ask for any money, just traded them to me. Don't think he was aware they sell for like 50 silver each on the AH. Gave him 2 gold just so he got something at the very least.
---
I dont think they will pay more then 100g if even that.... takes up a bagslot as well.
---
The reason they leashed Kazzak is because he was literally unkillable in a city since he healed when he killed someone and he was constantly throwing out Shadowbolts at everyone around him.  The infernal is bery much killable.
---
Like what? 38 mage here who planned to fish those quite a bit.
---
Don't forget to get all of those weapon skills up!
---
&gt;I have already "/played" around 46 hours
---
You gotta pump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers.
---
you will all be burned by instant pom pyros.
---
about the same for a priest too yet i still buff people
---
That's the point. It gives tank the precious few seconds to gain threat before you start aoeing them. They only need to care about healers mana.
---
Yeah it's undisputedly faster - especially in the current meta where you can tank dungeons and run cleave comps on a warrior much more easilly than you can find a dungeon farming group as a rogue.   
---
   
---
Rogue definitely has more 'get out of a jail' cards when things go wrong, but thats where the definition of 'good' warrior comes in.
---
Oh my god, yes
---
Meh, it's annoying when Americans and British (and Australians, and ...) people can't even speak their own fucking language properly. There's no excuse for a native to be worse at their language than a guy who has English as his fourth language (like myself).
---
Paladin and Warlock: free mount
---
I’ll look into that. Does that cover his nameplates as well?
---
Well, if the rogue insists its his chest he can fuck right off and will get kicked with great pleasure. DPS are as common as sand on the beach, if any DPS thinks he has to ninja loot or act like a prick he gets instantly kicked and replaced within 20 second by another DPS.
---
That's the price you pay for picking DPS, you are by far the least important part of the group and most easy to replace :)
---
I know you had to chose the server for a while, younger me was paranoid my friend would see my character on another server that I played on without him
---
...fuck
---
Thx for the advice, will give it a try.
---
Ya you are. So we did pick TF and Brill was a shit show with people. Which is good and bad. What made it bad is no one wanted to group up for some quests. Finally found a rogue and we went from 6-10 together pretty fast. For the Horde!

Paladins are fantastic in raids as healers so I see no reason not to. However I still believe in playing what you enjoy. Just lucky I enioy playing a female dwarf and a priest and everyone wants one.

Sounds plausible, but it would be kinda stupid if you are farming them and using layers to do so, afaik they wont respawn if you dont empty them.

As a holy paladin whose main attack is, well, auto attack, I salute you, brother.
---
For khaz modan! For the Alliance!
---
Pursuit of Justice checking in!
---
That's retail, not classic.
---
Hah got em!
---
Does if the Hunter chain pulls so the healer has no mana
---
That's just the dumbed down way to run a 5 man... most people use it because it easiest with a PuG... not at all the required way to do it.  
---
In fact I find it the most frustrating way to run them as a tank, when dps who can pull much faster than I can don't.  Dps is just as capable of reading the readiness of a group as a tank is.
---
IIRC they don't stack #sad
---
Atmosphere. Remember how i said i dont like dark and gloomy places?
---
yeah, thats tirisfal right there :p
---
Hilarious
---
20 years in the military after enlisting at 18?  I’ve heard of several 40ish year olds who’ve done 20 and retired.
---
Ya quests most of us have already done a billion times
---
Level 25 Druid - Horde - Stonespine.
---
Just looking for a friendly casual guild to get involved with really. Nothing hardcore about myself but its always nice to enjoy the experience and grind with other people and makes life alot easier when you can just chill and have a chat with people.
---
I'm 60 on my hunter and honestly the hunter hate is making me want to quit. I feel like I'm on eggshells all the time. I never make classic mistakes with multishot or my pet, but anytime extra mobs are pulled I'm the first one questioned. Mob group calls for help "did you multi shot that?" Pat aggroes the healer "was that your pet?". Gettin real old.
---
Actually, very little people need less than 8. Some feel they might need 6 and feel fine, but they will still have slept to little. Based on that podcast and his advice.
---
Thanks! I've head mixed things about Felwood tho. So I guess I'll head over to Un'Goro first.
---
I use Aux: https://github.com/shirsig/aux-addon
---
It's kind of complex as well, but it is well documented. If you read the page I linked, you should not have any questions. It also doesn't have that dependency hell Auctioneer brings (we have all wondered why we need Beancounter, Enchantrix, etc...)
---
It should be. Classics system requirements are much lower, than retail because of the low res, simpler world from more than a decade ago.
---
According to Intel, MoP was compatible with your VGA card:

---
So classic should run just fine on modest settings.
---
Sounds like youre describing alliance
---
So heroics and LFR are okay to be easy..?
---
Would'f
---
I might have overestimated... Just dinged level 20
---
AKA buy one from AH for 8 silver
---
This particular mistake is absolutely infuriating. How can so many people just type out stuff that doesn't make any sense at all...
---
Dont need sails underwater.

You could head to the south of the barrens- there’s lvl 18-22 quests there. But then there’s also some in stone talon, just at the entrance from the barrens. You will need to do a fair bit of zone hopping. Stonetalon has about 4 quest chains- not many quests, and they’re for 16-18 then 22-27. So you’d only be there for one quest chain at a time.
---
I was kinda hoping for more organic pvp opportunities TBH. On my server everyone quests in groups and pvp action is usually an organized group or raid event.
---
Interesting. After running uldaman, I have several ~20 silver items. TSM shows them with disenchant values on the order of 1.6 gold each. I was thinking about how many flowers I'd have to pick to make up the difference and was having difficulty justifying herbalism.
---
I'd happily pay either 30s for res or 30s for soulstone or 50s for summon than paying for a lockbox.
---
Why? Because running is a worse pain than most things. Dead or alive. Lockboxes? Random AF, and really, I'm okay with trusting Rogues on this.
---
Call on meeeeee, call me
---
Yeah God forbid you get some customization options in WoW.  It proudly lags behind every other MMO on the market in terms of personalization.
---
Woah - I had a friend who waited for days at lvl 37, fighting with the alliance and other horde players to tame it!
---
I'm playing a druid in classic and I throw MOTW on everyone I see pretty much, and i'll always go out of my way to heal/buff warriors and rogues. 
---
Back in BC I mained an UD priest and would go to STV/South Shore and MC lower level alliance characters, then give them fort and wave. Watching them go from full blown panic to wait, what? was always fun.
---
Lol, get out.
---
My job is great, but I'm underpayed for my performance so here I am.
---
:'(
---
class?
---
Aaaaand now you ve just given me a reason to actually stop at refuge point :)
---
Random
---
Rogue
---
Charlemagne :p
---
Yeah, bad bug then.
---
It’s been a great distraction. No game in ages has hooked me in besides wow
---
she has more free time \^\_\^
---
Bought em. I'm a warlock so I had some extra gold lying around from not having to buy a mount.
---
hotel?
---
This is genuinely really cool.  I'd play Spellsword in a fucking heartbeat.  I've been wanting a game to do justice to a "Warrior-Support" spec for a while.  A Faction-specific spec is a really neat idea too!  Thanks for this, this is fun :)
---
&gt; Anyway, my shaman is 41 and I’m loving the hell out of WoW Classic.
---
I'm stuck at 24 waiting for friends fishing in Tanaris.
---
meta-posts are useful but not to everyone
---
Plenty of wands
---
Yeah the discovery is fun. I heard Darkshore is best after lvl10. What’s the best way to traverse there?
---
Me and e friend toof 2 weeks vacation off work, we played around 19h à day with 6h sleep schedule. 
---
We hit lvl 60 after 6days ans 11h played
---
Awesome job.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Pretty epic last night. Total graveyard of bones. Especially in STV when we all raided their camp. Lol!
---
I didn't notice those, but no.
---
You obviously have no idea what you’re talking about, seeing as how shamans can’t dual wield in classic.
---
ITT: wOuLd Of
---
Yeah I think you're right lol. This sub is hilarious
---
Yes. You simply vendor the skins. At least until you get heavy leather and hides, ah those. You could ah medium leather too depending on ah prices on your server but generally you’ll just vendor those too.
---
A hunter that can effectively keep a month cc'ed with ice trap is amazing
---
Why do I keep seeing this cup and this etsy store posted here is this an ad
---
Bartender instead of dominos, Luna instead of Shadowed but otherwise correct. Only namechanges, and the ones you said work gloriously aswell
---
1/40 should ideally be druids because that’s how many there will be in a raid
---
You think you want it, and you do.
---
People have been having issues with it for a while, it's pretty fucked.
---
Are there any zones that would be good to grind just to level up? Level 30: I'm thinking of just relaxing killing boars still leveling. I know there's Furgbog farming 46-60.
---
Is STV the best place to farm before then? (horde so STV isn't super dangerous to me)
---
inb4 someone is crazy enough to buy it.
---
Shit. I got one of these and sold it for 50 gold to get my mount.
---
Well, i wouldn't say least important. All 3 roles are important in there own right. If there was a role that wasn't important, it wouldnt be apart of the group meta.   
---
Most easy to replace, yeah thats true.
---
Data is incomplete, need more uploads from peeps
---
I am in what seems to be the most effing nice server in like, all history of MMORPGs. I am positively flabbergasted at what seem to be daily episodes of random kindness.
---
Not only I am fully buffed by random peeps most of the time without ever asking, or get groups from everybody without ever being ignored or rejected.
---
Not only randoms trade me potions and greens good for a few levels, just like that.
---
Yesterday my level 19 Warrior aggroed three level 21 orcs in Redrige. When I was dazed and about to die, a Night elf Druid appeared, threw an emergency heal at me, went Bear, aggroed two of them and saved my ass allowing me a chance to run from the third orc with a sliver of HP left.
---
She was about to die when the third orc returned to aggro her as well, so I threw a quick half-bandage and charged back, thinking it would suck if only she died by saving me.
---
In the end we managed to barely pull it off, I thanked her wholeheartedly, she buffed my sorry ass, and went away.
---
I almost feel like I am being taken care of by the whole server.
---
Tbf 42 is a great number
---
Gotta get your steps in
---
So it lasted up until blizzard made them their own sandbox, they stopped being able to stomp normal players and then it died out.
---
You can sometimes get 3-4x vendor price for BoE greens on AH.
---
I think it's frowned upon to fuck a dog though.
---
I have pet attack and pet follow on mousebutton 4 and 5 the wheel is smoother for camera i think
---
I remember this too. I think they scrapped it because it was basically impossible to make the animation of Tauren running at 60% *not* look goofy.
---
Share please?
---
BUT BLIZZ HAS HAD 15 YEARS TO GET THIS RIGHT STOP SUPPRESSING MY ANGER I PAIS THE SUB
---
Not how you have to play, you do you. But this is a social game, so if you act like a shitty person, expect word to get out.
---
People who take you in unfair fights like will be "a bit shit" because they can't win fairly
---
The beauty of pvp servers in Classic, most people aren't great, but the thrill of world pvp makes them better by necessity
---
You unlock it and roll.
---
Depends on at what point in the game.
---
I mean mages are pretty much always top dps.
---
Hunters are probably top 3 DPS all the way up until bwl or AQ.
---
Warriors are up there if they're geared.
---
I'd put rogues as like 4 or 5 until post MC
---
I'm sure if he was actually cheating he will get taken care of eventually. The report system is a dumb as **** numbers game but it does work of you get reported enough.
---
Usually with cheaters they don't take instant action because it hides the ways that they detect things from the people developing the cheats. And overall this cuts down on cheats more than instabaning.
---
which is such a small playerbase on 1 class
---
It depends how you define easiest. It took me a couple of hours to level tailoring to 300 because I could buy the mats. Skinning, however, because I didn’t level it from 1-60 is taking an awfully long time. 
---
The crafting professions are ‘easy’ in the sense you can stand in the major city and AFK, but can have an enormous upfront cost if you are levelling them quickly. 
---
The gathering professions are ‘harder’ because you actively have to search the world for nodes, kill animals etc which requires a greater time investment. However, it won’t cost you any gold. 
---
When you have the bank, crafting professions are the easiest.
---
36
---
It's a grey area.
---
I say yes you can need IF you equip it once you get it, to show you did not just need on it to sell it on AH later.
---
That was great haha. The text to speech is the best part lol
---
Even though the horde is full of insecure sensitive people. Im glad you didnt get butthurt over this like the rest of you
---
that would be an ideal world, but then you have an issue where you have to put it on to prove it you're not selling it later
---
Most locks aren't expecting a heal there and won't ask for one. Just don't heal them. I use like tap until I'm almost dead so I can just eat a little and the use drain life on the next pull. I never am able to even get 2 sec into the food before the healer has me at full, it's annoying. Seriously just don't heal the lock life tapping between pulls.
---
Wheel of Time References for the win
---
Who though, I've never heard of anyone joining a custom world chat ay
---
If you're Alliance, enjoy your shorter queues when BGs come out. I sure will.
---
I see
---
You missed
---
Target dodged
---
Glancing blow
---
Target parried
---
Just altf4 already
---
Most alliance don't quest and just want to aoe farm dungeons this makes horde outnumber alliance alot. Then when I do see other alliance they don't help and just run away from the horde. I even saved someone from being ganked and he just ran away.
---
That's how obesity happens.
---
I remember that WotLK move when twinking died. One of the many little reasons I quit.
---
I understand the argument but I feel it's not the type of behavior that is good for the community. And comparing lockpicking and profession isn't really it, since only rogue can learn lockpick. For me it's part of their role and toolkit which in dungeon should be shared in my POV. I am not going to compare to healers role which have been already stated here, but I agree with the reasoning. 
---
If it was for me I'd rather roll for any content inside the chest which can be needed, and yes this mean splitting up ores and herbs which can earn really good money. But I am aware that it's impossible with pugs.
---
There is no "rule". Common perception is - if you are intending to wear (or use in case of recipies) the item, press need. Doesn't matter if BoE or BoP, or it's a shitty green Agi/Int ring or a the staff of jordan. 
---
Want to sell or disenchant? Press _Greed_
---
Ok, you do that. I'm gonna keep offering the locked chests to rogues.
---
I wish more soft pve people would realize the thrill of world PvP as you have. Has this changed your stance completely? Are you going to respec shadow sometime in the future and seek out PvP encounters?
---
Just curious, why do you play on PvP server if you actively avoid it? 
---
Thanks
---
Well... if you need the item as in you're gonna wear it you "need" on it. if you would just sell it (either AH or Vendor it) you "greed" on it.
---
Nice for extra damage on wing clip
---
The forsaken do a ton of stupid ass shit. Like just now I gathered some herbs for one, then got help from another high alchemist from undercity, then got murlock eyes, naga fins and a strong trolls blood elixir, so he can make some kinda poison with it. Then I raided Dun Garok to get him a keg all so he can kill 3 imprisoned farmers with it.
---
/bowing is the polite way to ask for a duel with the other faction.
---
Most people that twink for more than a few days get bored of stomping normal players and realize that all the fun is in competing with other min maxed players. Of course, when queues take several hours, nobody is going to bother.
---
16 here. Going strong at 14 hours /played.
---
while you studied the quiver, I declined hunters from dungeons
---
Depends on the party, but usually BoE has more place in the AH than on your head. Getting +5 int compared to your current item is ok, but getting 5g closer to your mount is divine.
---
My opinion is that BoE = need for all, especially since there is no guarantee that you will actually wear it if you get it.
---
Hit 60 with 5 Days 22
---
You're supposed to vendor the leather though.
---
Ita called Combuctor.
---
Nice try, Grenadier.
---
Might not be listed on launcher? I purchased through the website without an issue last year.
---
It’s like a 15/1 ratio.
---
Never said dps was not important; the dps player tho, he or she is not important to the groupe because they are easily enough replaced in a few seconds. 
---
At least, that's what i meant ;)
---
Probably because "would of" and "would've" sound exactly the same out loud so its a very common mistake people make.
---
Check out r/financialindependence
---
The concept is simple, live below your means, have a high savings rate and invest it in broad markets. I'm on track for age 35 but that'll depend on where I'm at career-wise and if I'm enjoying my work more so I'll then strive for more than a perpetual 40k per year.
---
I'm a rogue. I don't want to get kicked from a dungeon group for this, so please weigh in. What do you think of my etiquette for opening locked chests?
---
&gt; Lockpicking is akin to a tradeskill like skinning and/or mining. It is not the same thing as abilities like portal and/or mage food. People with gathering tradeskills are not (and should not be) expected to roll on nodes with people who do not have the sufficient tradeskills.
---
&gt; That said, I will roll for a locked chest to the only following players:
---
&gt; - Other Rogues with a sufficient lockpicking level, or
---
&gt; - Blacksmiths (or anyone for that matter) with keys in their inventory.
---
&gt; Everyone else wishing to get dibs on the contents of the locked chest is victim to the same greed as the ninja-looter rogue that doesn't roll to anyone else with the capacity to open it.
---
&gt; Mages are not obligated to create food for his dungeoneer buddies. Warlocks are not obligated to teleport either. I'm a strong advocate to preparation. If you want to have access to everything, be prepared. Otherwise, suck it up.
---
That's why I said jump, as in you're about to initiate and they aren't aware. It's not a super common scenario.
---
I am wondering the same thing
---
Made my first character on Al'akir on launch. Silly nelf warrior - only got to level 60 just before TBC was released. Remember getting ganked by a DarkStorm rogue a lot, brings back memories.
---
I wasn't there for long. Hit 60 on my warrior and rerolled somewhere else.
---
Yeah I mean, nobody said they're good guys. It's just I don't want people to bring retail politics (for lack of a better word) into classic.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Old but gold. :D Still remember that scene..
---
im right there with you, i love my light up wand.
---
No. Lockpicking is part of your class toolkit, not your profession. Am I supposed to pay you for using poisons next? lol get out of here. You're just greedy and will get blacklisted and kicked.
---
Happy cake and gz on bag.
---
im 35 ally war on whitemane and it feels at least 2:1 if not 3:1 in pretty much every zone around that level or below.
---
&gt; Maybe I will start a taxi service with aspect of the pack later on
---
This was already being advertised as a service on Grobby horde-side during the first week.  (Can't remember if they had AoP yet.)
---
I played ally human back in vanilla because I was young and wanted to be human. Switched to horde when I realized my naive mistake.
---
Is your shaman a troll by any chance?
---
Ditch this family dude
---
What do you want to look up? There are some built in filters
---
TSM seems real complicated
---
Okay. So how do you know when to actually stop attacking. Seems like a big negative, considering I rolled a lock, having never played WoW properly before, with hopes that I can get involved in a load of raids
---
I was talking about raiding, but even then paladins and druids can OT. A warrior is always going to preferred though. Probably should have made that a bit clearer :)
---
generally any white items you can sell on AH, but some wont have the demand to be worth it. also u can sell items like Light Feather in smaller stacks to try and sell them. but in many cases i still vendor skins if i need silver for stuff.
---
Aww :(
---
Turning 35 coming Friday, just started my own business but I'm going to take a look. Thanks for the tips!
---
Unique :(
---
Undead have the best racial ability for horde in vanilla, especially in PvP
---
It's really pissing me off that people are so prejudiced and are so quick to throw blame on the entire hunter class because something bad happened and the reason was somebody playing the class that op didn't like..
---
I've been parked in a dungeon since taking one pass at stvietnam might try badlands tho
---
what!? but there wouldnt be anything they can whine about - people just want to repeat history and just wash WoW out again so it becomes the retail monster it is today ..
---
because of spoiled brats like this: *"They are entirely uselss to cause chaos in an area now, something warlocks were quite literally born to do" -* EXUSE me but what the actual fuck how people can be so narrow minded and think they have the right to point fingers and assume bs like this, is beyond me
---
So you mean to tell me all the macro and keybind work I've been putting off til 60 is basically half done for me? 
---
Sign me the fuck up!
---
Hello everyone!
---
Is there an addon that lets you know the armor value of your target?
---
This ! That's the spirit. Especially if they chose a skin color next to yours.
---
Guy in my guild straight up deleted his 40 warrior a couple nights ago.
---
And rerolled another warrior with the same name.
---
Why? He wants the night elf mount and it was faster to refill for the rep....apparently.
---
Why not choose another name and just keep it? No idea.
---
Why not use the free transfer to just have it sitting on another server cos why not? No idea.
---
Weirdest thing I've seen in a while.
---
What server do you play on? I'm horde on incendius. If you are willing to switch servers you can play with us. Currently I'm level 33 buy plan on rolling a new character in a few weeks when one of my friends starts to play. I might even roll a new character with you if you want. I play in the Eastern Time zone usually around 830-1030 weeknights then weekends I play later
---
Most likely that was coincidence though. Changes aren’t done in weeks unless they are to fix something massive and game breaking. I would also find it very unlikely Blizzard would change something so universal based on one post in the priest sub that got some support given that would be a very, very small fraction of the priest player population as a whole.
---
I got my first Kings the other day. As a retail paladin main, God I miss it.
---
You'd think there was an add-on that translated this into bear grunts.
---
SP are great in the right hands, you did well. I too am playing alliance and yes I feel like it may be like 20v1 in a lot of situations, but wow are those 20 horde bad 1v1 or 2v1. I literally had to camp a hunter 6 levels higher than me because he killed me wile i was fighting 3 mobs on a escort quest
---
He said 15g per level, not hour.
---
You may know him as Obummer.
---
Great job of capturing the light and feel of the barrens. Nice choice of colors. Id love to see your interpretation of tirion fordring epl questline. :)
---
I understand that m8 thanks for the info
---
100 percent dependent on the player. I personally love the world pvp aspect and would not play on a non pvp server. If you enjoy pvp or think you'd enjoy the random encounters with other people while in the middle of leveling or questing, I'd say you're probably missing out
---
I am still deciding if that 50s for 225 is worth it :D   How much is a stack of heavy leather?
---
I've done it twice, once at 27 with 4 people (22,26,27) and once at 28  (28,28) with 3 people.  
---
It's not a difficult dungeon.
---
Okay thank you.
---
The key here is "Based on private server culture".
---
You're not on private servers anymore.
---
I am actually, I have like 10+ skill upgrades available to me that I havent purchased
---
Sorry, i dont believe I understand what youre saying.. did you say Resto Sham?
---
Ahaha ill be honest i totally forgot that Enh even had their own wep enhancements
---
BRB dl'ing this amazing addon
---
Cresting Charms, and 2 other types - Thundering and Burning, I think? Arathi Highlands, from fire, water and storm elementals in their respective Circles of Bindings across the area. Usually they are 20-60 silver @ AH, and in high demand by all the leveling warriors seeking their lvl 30 axe. About a 20-30% drop from 37-39 mobs, I believe. At least that's how the droprate felt to me.
---
I sold a bunch @ 50 silver, but for some reason yesterday Burning Charms, and only those, dropped to 20s for now.
---
The private server community is much much smaller than you think it is. This stuff doesn't apply to Classic.
---
And this is the part where warriors need to stance dance: 
---
Berserker stance: Berserker rage &gt; Battle stance: charge   &gt; blood rage &gt; thunder clap &gt; defensive stance until 20 rage &gt; battle stance: thunder clap &gt; defensive stance &gt; repeat
---
Well.. We all have little assholes inside us at least.
---
I bet you play a tauren druid
---
I was going to bring up the dick flyer but then thought well what’s more masculine than that?

You should get Metzen to voice him in an animated short about the quest.

There is a lot they could do with a 2nd episode.

Twist the big nerd quit the game after being killed got his life in order and is a developer for wow classic.
---
Pre-mount that's reasonable. Only mana is really needed for dungeons anyway.
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
No way you'd have queues this long with servers this large.
---
Its needed to dip into holy for strength % bonus and consecrate while levelling as ret, but yea probably holy still.
---
Im leveling as Skinning and Mining.
---
Selling all skins and keeping my ores and stones. Ill drop Skinning and takes BS. Once that is leveled, i will drop mining and take engineering. 
---
Ill have an alt capable of mining by then.
---
I may even be a madman and level alch for the trinket from that. The trick is u cn use your engineering stuff and alchemy items without the skill but you always need BS, i think.
---
What if the shot was taken on a laptop
---
Sweet
---
It’s not.
---
just create an own world chat, with blackjack and hookers

I was expecting the orc warrior to charge at you just to help you with the oozes :(
---
I always buff. Noticed most priests and druids buff me back- ty you lovely people
---
My kitten does the same thing when the pressure to catch things in monitor gets unbearable (I'm trying to teach her to not attack the monitor).
---
She also likes watching my cast bar fill up and orbs of shadowguard spinning :)
---
^or attacking everything that moves
---
Oh God how did you manage. I did it at 41 and it was a struggle.
---
I feel that Arugal Alliance pain my dude. Fight that good fight!
---
More importantly: they are not ever going to do that.
---
Hi, we moved our guild from Firemaw to Earthshaker. We aim to start raiding somewhere in nov, raids tues and thurs 20-23. You can chat with Lanacrista or Furix ingame. Guildname ”Glamorama”.
---
I think I've seen 10 separate posts about this the past week alone. At least try to be original.
---
There's software that duplicates your keypresses to multiple windows - either specialized for multiboxing, or just an AutoHotkey script you can easily find online. As long as it's not doing anything beyond that, it is fine by the rules (one keypress = one action per account).
---
From there you set up your keybinds to make it playable. Most commonly, forward key is bound to /follow macro on other accounts so your main character walks forward and others follow. Then figure out abilities as you please.
---
I played that way with 2 accounts many times (recruit-a-friend for x3 experience), never with more than 2 but it shouldn't be too difficult to scale as long as you don't try to use 5 different classes or something.
---
Oke.
---
You also get a new pet taunt every 10 levels that you have to train at pet trainer.
---
Nice, I flew there in the evening sun yesterday and it has some very nice lighting effects, but I went past before I could make a photo
---
Summary:
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because boar were already dead.
---
But IT IS. A player made channel. Classic has General, Trade, LocalDefense and LookingForGroup. This isnt a private server. I'm level 57atm and only joined world once and after seeing how badly my chat screen was getting filled I left and have never used it.
---
How does it work when you tie?

Also, you should go buy a lottery ticket like "right now" because law of averages.
---
soooo close yet so far... also 60 mount is going to be a bitch :D
---
Mine is not. Still have 3 months to go before my next job. I have litteraly nothing to do... So here I am, lurking and shitposting on /r/classicwow ...

3D chess
---
Quite sad.
---
I’m at 46? atm and feel like there’s more and more douches sadly. People flaming and not helping each other - hope they mellow out or something.
---
I know ...
---
It seems to be dying off. I will give AI to priests in hopes of getting a fort, yet they just run past me. One of them even had the nerve to as for water!
---
I really dig Leadership and Spellsword! How bout thinking of 4th specs for the other classes? :)
---
&gt;Combuctor.
---
I would say no, since I have never used etsy in my life. However this could be the next level of "ads are getting smarter". AM I EVEN ME?
---
Could have been me, but only if you provoked me, I was not usually a camper or ganker but if you fucked with my low level toon I would log onto my hunter, turn on track humanoids and fuck you up.
---
Good times :D
---
PW:S on a warrior is okay in certain situations.  However when rage starved it is a warriors worst enemy.
---
A pleasure ! :D
---
&gt; a "Warrior-Support" spec
---
Umm, that's there, it's called Retribution Paladin.
---
it would only bother me if gold did more than it currently does, buying off the AH isn’t how I’d go about getting good gear
---
It seems like many people don't even realize there's a difference until they get invested, but then by that time they don't want to admit thier ignorance so they just rage
---
You're talking about the deposit, not the AH cut
---
We get it, we get it, priests are really really good in classic.
---
Depends, do u want him to come back and corpse camp u after a fair fight?
---
Dude. I feel so stupid but this was it. Thank you for answering, and see you in Azeroth :)
---
Absolutely. To be honest it’s almost like there’s an opening for a company to make a genuine MMO again. Could it be blizzard ? I don’t know, feels like the company has gone too far down the rabbit hole.
---
*So what do you guys think? Is this harmless? Is it wrong?*
---
dude, botting is against TOS.. it dont matter if people think its wrong or not.
---
&gt;A world channel is meant to be a free to all, general channel that  most players  join  when they want to ask a general question to all other players  feel like some barrens chat outside the barrens, or leave if they want some quiet time.
---
how do you come to this conclusion.
---
if there was meant to be, then blizz would surely make it a default channel you join automatically.
---
Back in the day in Gagetzan I was playing a Hunter and duelled an Alliance hunter. As the start of the duel was counting down we both started mashing for our pets to attack. At the same instant our pets made beelines for the nearest opposite faction player, and aggro'd the guards on us. Cue us both dying in moments.
---
It was hilarious.
---
I might have the time, depends how soft your lips are?
---
Get a AH add on so you don't have to sort by lowest bid price.
---
Every time they do this they end up wasting the auction house fee.
---

hmm no =&gt;  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17966/onyxia-hide-backpack](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17966/onyxia-hide-backpack)
---
Lets say I spot Broken Tooth or some other rare and want to share the news. Should I use LFG for that?
---
What happens after 45?
---
Yeah, I wish they would do single server BG before introducing crossrealm.
---
It is. It’s a funny quote from the WoW Southpark episode.
---
No Canadian delivery :(
---
This is mainly for arms, when you get WW and MS its no point to use it anymore.
---
Cool, now give it a year and I'm sure you'll come back to this post and realize it was more than a joke
---
World chat? You mean mindless spam and jokes galore
---
Meanwhile as a warlock I went out of my way to get the nifty stopwatch and the skull of impending doom just so I don't have to trot around so slowly while waiting till I get my deleted. Just sucks they're such long cd's
---
I mean, wouldn't you get mad? An enormous monster is trying to kill you AND your feet hurt? I'd be full of rage.
---
Yep: I made around 10g on sulfuras just buying silk on the AH for 30s. Leveled my first aid to 240.
---
I think with a new IP they wouldn't end up disappointing and angering millions of fans.
---
If you think they can top Warcraft, they can't.
---
You are the one with zero IQ friend, a new IP is a new start, no expectations from players so total freedom to create.
---
You are the one that wants them bogging themself down attempting to recreate the success of a 15 year old game.
---
I'm the biggest world of Warcraft classic fan imaginable, I already have a 60 with full bis and cleared rag and ony, and even I think classic + is stupid.
---
That boat has sailed, they've tried to improve Warcraft for the last 15 years and have failed miserably, classic plus will be a huge disappoint and only serve to crap on classics legacy.
---
Bring on a new IP, something fresh where they have total freedom to create without having 10 million angry Warcraft fans telling at them for every minor change.
---
The number corresponds to the order that you join. After you join LookingForGroup (everyone should) it will be /5
---
I like boars and wind serpents.  Bonus, they both eat mage food
---
Or on my druid in Feral Swiftness Cat / Travel form.
---
It's worth mentioning that this is an add-on that's requires a subscription (I pay $7.99 a month). If you play both retail and classic, I highly recommend it but if you only play classic, it would be very hard to justify this. The reason I say this is zygor has over 6,000 guides built in for retail for everything from leveling, professions, farming, dungeons, acquiring mounts, etc. While it only has a guide to level to 60 via questing on classic. An acceptable, free add-on that is similar is Azeroth auto pilot.
---
Thank you my character is called Kassius. I’m only level 31 as I’ve been held back by queues since launch but I do hope to be doing some raiding and PvP. So hopefully I can eventually join in. I will message either Lana or Furix ingame!
---
they're unique. sadly.
---
Ha, joke’s on you... I play a Warrior so I am never gonna fight more than one mob at once anyway unless I want to die
---
Well, today I learned. That's insane, I always assumed it was 15 seconds in tbc.
---
Oh boy, you set yourself up for having a rough time in a social game. Between greedy rogue and incompetent paladin, I cant see me having you in a group ever again lol. Then again, I'm a free human being making that decision. :-)
---
I think I tried that and it just said it increases crit but not by how much. I’ll check again.
---
It all started with a dwarf warrior. Most of my friends were alliance so I figured I should be part of it. Thing is, I was also friend with a selfish hunter and lost alot of gear. I used to get killed by the horde ALOT and lose almost every BG. I was very dedicated and ended up 60, tanking some ZG nonetheless.
---
At this point, you must be wondering what's up with my flair? Well, I got tired. I decided to start a rogue with the horde on another server secretly and I LOVED it. Everything was going better, I won in PVP and BGs. Everyone was friendlier and I had no friends to steal my gear. Yeah it kinda enlightened me that they were not great friends too but since this day, I never went Alliance again.
---
I prefer their zones and their cities, but nothing compare to the spirit of the Horde!
---
i wonder the same about PVE servers, you just fight mobs? boring af
---
By my estimation, warlocks. I don’t see a lot of em.
---
Im just smarter than u. This is what it's like.
---
Just vendor the skins, it's still decent g/hr for some side income while leveling. It is not worth putting them on AH.
---
Once you pick up the 30% movement speed talent it gets way better.
---
60 mount is a bitch for anyone except people who enjoy obsessive grinding or get lucky with a few purple boe world drops.
---
Don't worry, you still have the opportunity to lose Hand of Justice too!
---
Yes, when I posted, I didn't know that the other servers were also being affected, I was trying to say something like: Blizzard should give us some kind of benefit because we spend our money on the game and we can't play because of this DdoS attack
---
A stack of heavy vendors for 30s and you'll get dozens of them from just leveling in STV. The point is to skin as you level naturally and make some extra cash as you go. Light through heavy will always be worth next to nothing.
---
But that's naturally aspected to Holy spells - it's magic.  A pure physical class with the ability to do support would need it's abilities to be.. well, abilities and not spells.  Dealing in themes like Inspiration, Morale, Strategy and such.
---
thats pure Canadiana right there
---
its an Elvui reskin called Benik and Details for my damage meter
---
nice bait take my upvote and leave :D
---
the devilsaur set is BiS i believe for druid as well
---
It was fun on some Private servers because with the low population, you could organize dedicated events and have a blast
---
Yep, level 40
---
I would would like to offer my sincere condolences to your tank. Back during the BC-era I tanked SM Cath as a protection paladin. I had made a reputation for myself as "the Tankadin", so I was really looking forward to getting my mailed palms on the "Aegis of the Scarlet Commander". Well, what do you know, a good for nothing dr00d ninjad it from me. I couldn't even be mad at him since it turned out that he was like 10 years old and went with the logic "hey I can use shields, oh shiny!". I gave him a stern talking to and quit WoW for good soon after. A few days ago I saw that very shield on a streamer who was showcasing his "Holy Shield" tankadin-build, and I felt my heart skip a beat. Fuck ninjas.
---
And that's pretty much the reason why I don't get anything done today at work.
---
China, and yes.
---
It's a generic wooden mug and they put a little horde or alliance sticker on it for you (wow!). You can also get your favorite sports team, or capeshit movie logo.
---
Have two of them on retail :(
---
Couldn't sell for many months.
---
I'm gonna go to hell for laughing
---
not much, if you are a good shaman people take you in regardless. This is an rpg and you should play what you enjoy
---
Here is my stance on it as a rogue. A locked chest is the exact same as a rare mining node. If there are more than 1 person in a group who can mine the node, those people roll on it. If there is more than 1 person who can unlock a chest, those people roll on it. If my group doesn't like it, thats fine, but im not unlocking it.   
---
Now before everyone downvotes the crap out of me: If there is any items in it that I would not use, I will 100% of the time ask the group if anyone needs it. Im not going to keep a green cloth bracer that gives +10 intellect just to vendor it when it could be an upgrade for someone else in the group. That and lockboxes are always a greed roll unless everyone else is needing on it too.
---
Uh that's not possible sap breaks on any damage, cheap shot does damage
---
Its when youre mid air durring a lethal blow is it happens to me

Levelling a warrior...one mob at a time.

Red is dead no matter how much health or what they're doing.  But, the key word is dead.   Good for you kicking his ass.
---
Talk to your rogue trainer. He might have some advice :)
---
Why not add a component of trust?  Don't forget this is an mmo and player interaction is more valuable than loot.
---
I love wow with family because you can tell a lot about people by how they act when the stakes are low. 
---
I figured out my mom cares more about my step dads happiness than mine when she practically forced me to give his rogue the druid boots off kara trash when they would have replaced my quest green.
---
That or Enhancement Shaman. You can dip into resto for extra support.
---
I would like to know this as well.  I don't know why the wand firing sound has to be so much louder than everything else.
---
Stop basing your vanilla knowledge on private servers
---
I love buffing VWs with thorns and MoTW.
---
Actually alliance have better racials and paladins, which is superior healing class in pvp. Every hardcore PvP guild rolled Alliance or should roll alliance because of racials. So nvm. And yet wea re sitting here, overcrowded horde on every server... I am asking, why? horde is superior only in TBC, but alliance is far better in vanilla because of paladins, fear wards, stoneforms, escape artists etc etc....
---
Stupid ass gnome
---
Did you drop engineering entirely or use the book in tanaris? If you dropped it entirely and picked eng back you will still be a gnomish engineer
---
I see no issue with giving people more content if that's what they want. As long as they keep some untouched classic servers out for people like you.
---
You just wanna sell your bags! You get get two 14 slots at level 41-42ish easy. Just goyta run uldamanand do the quest with the pirates south of booty bay
---
I even made a macro to turn on and off my autoloot to not fuck up lockpicking (ik about shift).    
---
Dick move on the rogue
---
Undead Warrs are great dude; with wotf and Zerker Rage that's 15 seconds of Fear Immune, wotlf will also break Succubus Charm and Magic Dust, Cannibalise is a free First Aid every 2min that scales with your gear, thats a heck of alot better than Warstomp or Blood Fury (Orc Hardiness is good... If it actually procs...).
---
If I get WA at level 30 my lips will be softer then Britney’s Spears bald head right after shaving
---
It's a race to four bottomless bags now to get internet points.
---
Deposits aren't 60% of the vendor price.
---
imagine believing all redditors are human lmao
---
Awww this is great And I love seeing this wholeness shit in WoW. I’ve been trying to be more giving this time around knowing what I know now. I now have extra bags from questing—I don’t want to waste money opening more bank slots so I gave away the five I had in lowbie areas to players I knew needed them more than the few silver I’d get from selling them. 
---
I’ve also started inspecting players around me when I have BoE greens to see if they need them. I practically fully geared up a fellow mage the other day that was in all white/grey gear (~lvl 15) and the dude was super stoked. When I go out questing I make a ton of every water/food and hand them out to my fellow mana users when I pass by. 
---
We’re all broke and struggling to get by in classic wow right now. I figure the few gold in total I will eventually lose before getting my mount pales in comparison to the help maybe I can provide other player. 
---
Or who knows, maybe all those people just vendor the shit I give them so they can afford to pay their skill bills. Either way, makes me feel good.
---
No way, there's no mob behind level 50 that you wouldn't't skin with your 225 skill, so don't max it untill you buy your mount.
---
After that you can max it out if you're willing to keep skinning till late 50's
---
I agree - I feel that a lot of people who are playing Classic are far more polite and helpful than retail (or even original vanilla).
---
Maybe it's the camaraderie of playing Classic together and reliving those times all over again?
---
According to the aforementioned imp name list the odds are 1 in 961, so... pretty rare i guess
---
Your wee wee falls off
---
I have macro with stance and charge: it seems working fine
---
butwhythough.gif
---
Wait, how? I've tried doing this and it always ends up casting on myself. I figured you would just MC, target them, press your buff?
---
My bro just started classic so I gave him 4 wool bags, 2g, and a lesser magic wand. He's living the dream
---
Are you aware Trix are for kids?
---
Classic certainly has some issues like how half of the existing specs aren't viable at all, but overall it's just so great.
---
Both work, but my method simply generates more threat points over same amount of time - even when comparing thunder clap in BS vs battle cry in DS. (there's a lot of calculations made over the years for vanilla/classic).
---
I guess hides would be the equivalent of the black lotus from herbalism. They have a low drop rate.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE, peace no more.
---
I sorta feel you. I actually think that mages are the nicest on my server and i almost always get a buff back
---
Literally only get attacked by alliance when they are in pairs.
---
Levelling a warrior really isn't that bad, just get out of the mentality that you have to always be doing Yellow quests. Green quests, and green mobs, are the best way to do it. The thing that makes warrior levelling bad is the disproportionate amount of downtime, but this is massively reduced by sticking to green quests. 
---
My warrior has to eat/bandage once for every two yellow mobs pulled. But that goes down to like once for every 5 or 6 green mobs pulled. The experience per kill is less, of course, but the xp/hour and lower downtime make it waaaay better.
---
225 skinning should allow you to skin up to level 45 mobs, so I plan to wait until I have my mount - unless I'm very far from mount money when I near 40, at least.
---
Is he still a cult leader preaching to an audience of 10,000 twitchtv bots or did that fall through at some point?
---
Need for profession&gt;greed?  That's very greedy.  I you want resources to level your professions you can farm them or buy them on the AH like everybody else.
---
you need to have /cast expose armor /stopattack
---
even then this takes camera finess, you cant break sap if you cause no damage, so try and spin 180 after you ea
---
Meh. I take all fights. I see an enemy and they're around my level? Kill. Not gonna stand there and wait for them to sit and eat - because they wouldn't do the same for me.
---
Why?
---
You can _easily_ auction the leather for double the vendor price. All the stuff which is near vendor price will be bought out within minutes anyways from flippers.
---
Hunters are expected to *faint death* half the fight.
---
What was their reply in a nutshell? Still waiting for a reponse on my appeal. Just wondering what the hell it actually was. Thanks
---
Just got my mount, so fortunately can’t relate :)
---
Prob not so close to classic wow being a success. They will probably announce it for mid-late 2020 at blizzcon this year.
---
Delete this
---
Ive actually always strafed. I can confidently say I was never a keyboard turner, filthy casual keyboard turners make me sick...
---
In what world are dungeons more 'refreshing' than quests?
---
I've been running through Wailing Caverns and the only thing keeping me from ending it all is the fact that I have to look out for the plants and hides for the quests.
---
I already have mouse overs it was one of the first things I did but I’ll definitely use that wand macro, thank you
---
As a mage if I get a bunch of aggro and frost nova is down I will blink away with the intention of looping back around to the tank. It takes a few mobs off smacking them and I am usually quite safe so I don’t need the tank to go running after them.
---
YESSSSS. 
---
I’m a paladin since 2005. Paladin in retail.
---
As ret Horde don’t get it when half their health evaporate when my Seal of Command procs. 
---
But playing paladin for so long I was a holy paladin back in the day and to add on to your story; horde never realize what hit them before it’s too late. They think of me as a low dps healing class that’ll bubble hearth. They don’t realize that I can chunk their health bar with holy shock. That I can have my holy shock crit whenever I want. That the fight will cost you 15 minutes of your life only for you to run back to your body while I sit on 87% of my mana still available and my 9 different health bars untouched.
---
You're right, it's basically go to ratchet, then southern barrens, then hillsbrad (but you have to take the zeppelin and run from silverpine), then back to southern barrens, then to ashenvale, then back to southern barrens, then to ratchet, then to silverpine, then abck to ratchet.
---
While I can troll whole day long that Alliance is better choise that would be pointless. If someone like one faction - cup with other faction logo would cause pain
---
/world can someone invite me to layer pls?
---
The question is rather, why would you?
---
Humans truly are incredible. Pound for pound, just terrible matchups with soooo many predators. Then, you factor in intelligence and the social aspect and we’re unstoppable.
---
We’re supposed to be a unit!
---
nope, 152 kills so far, ill keep grinding tho :D
---
God damn it, I just found out that the Rogue PVP trinket removes only: charm, fear and poly. This sucks so bad! I can already remove fear and charm with WotF, which makes the trinket kinda useless. This trinket stuff makes orc even better. Damn this sucks.
---
You coulda got another 14 slotter from a quest south of booty bay
---
can you heal them too?
---
That's amazing, I hope you do a worgen one &lt;3
---
What...an...amazing story. This is some top notch stuff. I WANTED to read it. It was set up so well and over delivered on the punch. I felt the same exhilaration for you and found myself detesting the horde orc as much as you.
---
Write MOAR!!!
---
Once you can solo DM you can carry lower levels thru it in exchange for all boe’s.  You make a decent bit
---
the idea of casting while using autos sounds really cool.
---
OP has to get his kills in one way or another.
---
You of 2 liters of coke?
---
Woah bro, I'll repeat, its just a prank.
---
It's honestly not worth it. Maybe with a 4 speed weapon. Piercing howl is a bit better but honestly leeway means you're getting hit
---
Okay awesome. I figured agility was important for rogues but wanted some second opinions. Thanks for the advice!!
---
The skill difference in vanilla is the prep, not the frostbolt spam
---
Most of them prefer backstab it seems.
---
I have one player on ignore now, me and a mate did a quest with them and they clicked need on a green they couldn't use (at level 24 ffs) said cya and left leaving us with a load of mobs. I won't even click need on shit I can use at this level unless it's really useful and I check first (in dungeons).
---
he's lvl 23 and you can only tame pets the same level as you or lower
---
Exact same here
---
CC have a chance of breaking before the maximum duration, the longer it is on the higher the chance it breaks. It would be overpowered if you can freeze someone for the entire duration all the time.
---
Curious question / need advice. I messed up a few things on my warrior. I started leveling prot found out it's slow/not the best and read somewhere that 2h fury was good so I respec and start following a tree for that. Then read Its mainly used with windfury totem or something I think ? I dont know but I'm lost and wondering if I missing something, it seems I should've just went arms because of the whirlwind axe. Now I'm getting discouraged from playing and wondering how good fury is and if theres some good weapon options for duel weild with gold already being a huge issue when I get to 60 I want to go prot and need to spend 5g.
---
Goddamn Pandas.. JK
---
This is fucked.
---
PSA: making macros with /cancelaura (nameofshapeshift) will let you cast with one button.
---
For example :
---
#showtooltip
---
/cancelaura Ghost Wolf
---
/cast Flame Shock
---
I was a total pacifist back in those days, I think that character gathered up a grand total of 10 honorable kills or something like that. But, yeah, I think most people would kill me just because I was a male nelf. Not saying I didn't deserve it. :P
---
I cannot for the life of me finally settle on one class between warlock, mage and rogue.  
---
I want to do wpvp, duels and bg's mostly. Don't care much about pve, I don't mind spamming 1 button.  
---
I love the warlock sustainability and survivability, and the fact it can 1v1 mostly anyone after 42. I especially like that they counter mages.  
---
I love the mage mobility and utility, and the fact it is so good in every single aspect of the game.  
---
I love the rogue stealth and visual, and the fact it has outplay potential in 1v1's and world pvp.  
---
Now, on the cons:  
---
I hate how warlocks have no mobility, I dislike soulshards and playing around wotf.  
---
I hate how slow rogues feel while stealthed, and I am absolutely terrible with stealth in every single game. I'm more of a up in their face type of player.  
---
I hate how **MANY** mages there are. It feels so much more than 20% of population is mages.
---
Can’t wait for BfA+, personally.
---
Flamelash-EU? A NE Hunter went by me saying the exact same
---
Wow, I love this! Any way to get it in a phone aspect ratio? I've set it as my wallpaper but I it doesn't show all the amazing art!
---
As a hunter your are basically after as much agility as possible. Anything with good agility or has an effect that benefits your pet is fair game. That's your main goal when rolling for gear. It doesn't matter is it's a sword, axe, or even an off-hand.
---
First sentence and I expected it to be another one of those "I em heal and sometime tenk pool when I low mana :(((( is bed"  
---
Turns out it was a great anecdote, nice one OP!
---
Loser
---
How different is tanking mc compared to dungeons? I've tanked up to sunken temple

It IS a profession, regardless if it’s class restricted.

Adding to wallpaper folder
---
I really like the irony of playing an Undead Holy Priest.  
---
This, and the group of people I play with started a poll before Classic went live, and Horde won (12-1...).
---
I think its cool to see the other servers population a bit.
---
Makes a lotta sense, tbh.
---
Same man!! Dinged 40 at midnight last night with 97g total!!!well done dude, it’s a great feeling. Now I plan to enjoy the game do some fishing and professions for a break from questing/grinding.
---
yes but AoE levelling isn’t exactly a feature of most other classes, they’re tankier than cloth wearers (not that they need it with stuns and their insane dps) and bandages are fine as self heals
---
I levelled a rogue to 70 in TBC and it was a breeze, especially considering I first mained warrior
---
The main problem is they always get the jump in me out of stealth with slow poison I can never get away. Had a trap set idk what happened to it. After round one there were two of them so... Not much to be done there. Opened on one the other was on top of me.
---
'Need' is perhaps a strong term, but it is true that they grind mobs the slowest and depending on what is selling well on your server, it could make practical sense to have a mage or something to go blow through mobs. There should be something you can do (profession-wise) to make money, but if you're just sitting around doing professions, that time *could* be arguably better spent on an alt that farms faster.
---
Having free time is a problem we all struggle with - the game is absolutely playable and fun at almost any commitment-level - but I wouldn't compare your experience to people who are playing 2+ hours/day, as you wouldn't if you could noodle on the guitar compare that to people practicing all day every day. If you aren't comfortable with the ration of what you put in and what you get out of it, I would recommend putting in more or less so that your efforts better match your expectations, but that's just me.
---
I also might not play a paladin :P
---
Not every raid back in the day brought the perfect dps comp of 200 warriors, 200 mages and rogues.
---
if you want to drop a proff, you should probably drop engineering since it is way more expensive to level without mining.
---
Where should I go after The Barrens ? ( 26lvl Troll Mage) Also what dungeons beside WC are suitable for me at that lvl ?
---
It may be because while some classes like Warrior or Paladins are very slow to level they can bypass that in classic by joining dungeon farm groups. Rogues aren't very sought out for those groups because they are looking for good AOE from dps and warriors can do it in a melee cleave group or just being a tank in a hybrid tank plus caster AOE group.
---
Paladins can sneak thru as a healer :)
---
slowly starts to ...
---
Isn't sap a shit CC in vanilla? Never seen a rogue use that. I think it takes them out of stealth or something.
---
IIRC, that is true for other (all?) cloth as well. If one doesn't need the cloth and can't be bothered to fight the flooded AH, turn it into bandages and vendor it.
---
How is it much much harder?  You guys outnumber alliance on every PvP server across the board lol. 
---
Pretty easy to 5v2 everyone lol. 
---
Also with demo shout abuse I don’t think salvation is a huge deal.  Threat isn’t that big a deal after the first few clears.
---
Chests don’t exist solely in dungeons either, what’s your point?
---
Lol can People not take a bit of fun? xD
---
Ohh well... I guess you'll be banned for scamming People :O
---
Because it is obviously a scam already when you haven't actually done anything.
---
This was like listening to one of the Warbringer shorts that blizzard did for WoD. This was awesome!
---
He said he wasn't going to take any hand-outs from viewers until he got to level 60 and got his epic mount.  One side note is that he made that promise when he intended to roll on a PVE server.  Rolling on a PVP server and being streamsniped anywhere outside of dungeons pretty much made him change his mind.
---
Just tell me if you're going to STV any time soon!
---
Regards,
---
Horde scum that wanna make sure that he logs out in time.
---
Didn't know you can cast your own spells while in control of someone else
---
Wow, on krom crusher druids and paladins are
---
Constantly buffing me and im throwing out priest buff on everyone i encounter in the wild
---
But why be pacifist on a pvp server?
---
Did friends drag you to it?
---
It still doesnt change the fact that multiple different sources rate rogues as subpar for leveling, warriors being the only thing worse.
---
rogues shouldn’t be relying on their tanking ability
---
If you get a year out of ANY game, was it really just rose tinted glasses?  Also, what about all the phases they have planned?  I personally cannot wait for AB, AV, WPVP.  I feel like there is going to be a decent amount of new content to keep people going for a while.
---
"Lucky bastard"? Thunderfury is a tank item and always goes to the main tank first, it's a HUGE boost to their threat output. Being the main tank is a pretty big responsibility, needing to farm out and maintain a bunch of different sets, generally using the most consumables and being basically required to show up to every single raid.
---
Helping them out isn't exactly a bad thing.
---
Yeah except Mankrik isnt sad at all 😂
---
I could've sworn this hat buff worked differently at one point. It would buff 1 person, and then you could take it off. My guild would do hat buffing circle jerks before raids.
---
I didn't get banned myself, a friend got banned for no good reason because a multiboxer decided to report him with all his accounts
---
Took me 3 months the first time. What's the rush?
---
Did you leave the 1 out? Kick him out of the guild or however you stayed in touch? Haha
---
Is it confirmed that retail is getting Tinkerer? I haven't heard anything other than rumors
---
2 days ago I got kicked out of a SM farm group for not doing enough damage. I was the shaman healer and did some aoe dmg with my magma totem. 1 minute later the guy realized that I was in fact the healer, but I already found a new group and put him on my ignore :D can't stand people with e-peen mindset, he was a warrior with ravager and complained about the dps of all other group members constantly (obv. a warrior with ravager does more damage than most other classes in aoe situations, especially compared with a healing shaman in healing gear).
---
I do not, though if I were a gamblin' man, no profession really outclasses any other if you are just vendoring everything, as that is something Blizzard easily could (and I imagine has) homogenize.
---
I was rooting for you over the orc until you called yourself a memelord. Now I wish he won.
---
Yes yes, the alliance is full of self confident ladies and gents with hardened thick skin.  Only the horde harbors insecure and sensitive people
---
I don't even know why Hunters buy a mount at 40, Aspect of the Cheetah and Pathfinding talent, is what 36% speed?
---
Unless you have longer than 1 minute to travel, mounting is actually wasting time.
---
I just hit 24 last night and feel like I am going super slow compared to my friends that don't have kids.  Either way I am having a blast leveling up and doing dungeons.
---
Thanks man, I've learned my lesson.
---
You are fortunately unfortunate to be way ahead of the mass. Join LFG if you havent, ask your guild, and/or start your own group.
---
1.8 IIRC :'(
---
World PvP is where it's at. Nothing better than taking over the other factions town
---
Ahh a feigned retreat classic move
---
Current Classic is based on the TBC Prepatch and they aren't there... so no, it definitely wasn't.
---
Winning the roll is the biggest high this game offers.
---
You must be this tall to read the sign.
---
We call Grobbulus players Grobbers all the time
---
Oh my bad, dont know why I read it as hour haha
---
Right-click doesn't activate autoshots in Classic, unfortunately, only melee (assuming you mean at a distance, pre-pull).
---
If the tank is above 60% I don't heal. If dps is below 80% I may pop a bubble or renew if they have aggro.
---
I don't know, I was asking myself the same question, but maybe it's just about data uploads, if only 1 alliance uploaded vs 10 horde, data will be skewed
---
Yeeuuuh people aren't going to suddenly realise they wanna make twink characters. People holding / hording stuff for phase two might make some money, but everything else will get more expensive too (except for static stuff like skills / mounts)...
---
If you want big boy damage, you bring 3 mages and spellcleave your way through the dungeon. 
---
Rogue damage is only competitive in 2 target situation when they got their blade flurry up.
---
Sounds awesome man, glad you’re having fun!
---
I think see mind soothe yesterday and stopped to appreciate that for a second!
---
Give them the buff that increases damage taken and hope they just assume any buff is good.
---
Oh no, its harder to grief players on my own faction... better rage about it.
---
Let them die from pulling aggro, they will learn.
---
I save low level shoulder pieces and give them out to players I pass without :).
---
You said you don't understand why people play in PvP server. That's the reason why
---
I burn and I plunder as it soothes my desire
---
Every single thread about something lvl 40+ lol
---
Saved for when i get out of grey shoulders
---
that's genius... ;o
---
This feels very Banner Saga to me, which is a game I fucking love so take it as a compliment. This whole series is making me hella nostalgic for leveling up as horde.
---
Why would they believe you when you can't even down garr
---
&gt; You see, and this is why it’s not worth it to me.
---
This is exactly why i am leveling enchanting on my main, without vellums(?). Having to shout out for an enchanter to enchant my gear every time is tiresome.
---
Weren't you or the warrior party leader?
---
No jumper cables?
---
There are plenty of nights I log on and don’t really want to PvP, even though it’s what I enjoy about the game. I just wanna grab some coffee and pop a level.
---
Last night I was walking a road (I’m forsaken warlock), and I see a gnome mage running directly at me, no obvious hostility and skull to me.
---
So I jumped over him..hahahaha... I figured better than stepping on him. I guess he was offended because he opened up and blew his load on me. I just turned and watched, sac’d the vw, fear, and kept running down the road. Hilarious encounter. 
---
Tl:Dr sometimes PvP is awesome, sometimes a pain, but I always want the possibility of a great encounter.
---
If you plan on selling it, and someone in the group actually does NEED it, then yeah, you should probably read the names of the options again and think about your question
---
Blacksmiths and i believe engineers also have tools to unlock chests.
---
You don't have a pihole or additional firewall do you? If been struggling with disconnects for months and discovered my pihole was blocking the voice server connection and the client was using that as a "guess they are disconnected" prompt.
---
Bit strange that the voice server connection would be the check the client relies on but it did solve the issue once I allowed the connection.
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot
---
I guess you're not going to forgive that guy ;)
---
im lvl 11 human warrior so im in the first area
---
I tried this. It doesn't do what I want, or at least I can't figure out how to make it do it. 
---
I want numbers above the heads of the people I heal, just like when I deal damage to a mob. With MIK, it only allows for some weird number scrolling around your character. If I am wrong, I would love to know how to configure it to do it the way I described.
---
Go cry! This was classic is about. If you want war mode go back to retail!
---
Or you take the gnomeregan quest “Rig Wars” in org, a quest next to the giver will become available, go to Booty Bay and you can teleport to outside Gnomeregan and then run from Dun Morogh through a little bit of Loch Moran to Badlands.
---
Let me guess you didn't level a dps?
---
I also choose tongue out for the extra charisma
---
Imagine rolling a lock just to find out a fun part of your class is removed. Imagine priests not being able to MC enemy players.
---
Priests are beasts. As long as you have mana. Since you’ve discovered PvP is quite awesome and exhilarating, I’d suggest grabbing any items that help in PvP..trinkets and such. Even a 3 second stun can be the difference between winning and losing. And don’t get discouraged if you lose. You’ve mastered PvE, now you have a new challenge!
---
I was SO SAD when they removed mind soothe. It was like stealth for priests.
---
I've never seen a rogue refuse to open a locked chest or ask for payment. I think people who are having these experiences have to be low lvl. Rogues are gonna be in for a rude awakening at 60 if they try that shit. They're already not welcome in most groups simply because they have a lot of shared loot with warriors, who are tanking 90% of the time. 
---
I've had a rogue beg me in PMs to not leave a shit show of a dungeon group yesterday because it takes him hours to find a spot into a LBRS. If this rogue wanted so badly to slog through the dungeon with the shittiest tank and shittiest comp I've ever witnessed in my life, I'm guessing rogues are pretty desperate to get into runs.
---
TL:DR if you're a rogue, be real accommodating to your group. You can't afford not to.
---
Check if correct account selected in account dropdown
---
The ones that did still came nowhere close.
---
Melee mage or "battlemage" is pretty cool. Rift had this and called it Harbinger.
---
Nothing like slapping peeps with a sword then tossing an instant pyroblast into their face when you get a proc.
---
:D
---
Supply and demand, when supply floods the market prices go down
---
Are you trying to be funny?
---
I didn’t kill. He was just dead in our area so /spit on him
---
So you've never played Guild Wars 2 then? One of the best and most utilized specs in the game is a Support Warrior (Banner Slave) that can build with Condition Damage (dots) or a Physical Damage that focuses on being the main source of the groups CC.
---
Again, that's just what you got out of classic. Things you enjoy about the game aren't necessarily the things others enjoy about the game. If the whole "point" of classic was pvp, why even bother having raids at all?
---
If this was on an Oceanic server, then you probably killed my friend (level 20 something orc warrior). Happened around 1-2 pm AEST which was around the time you posted this.
---
As a warrior, thank you from the bottom of my heart, if you buff me and stick around I give those priests mana pots.
---
I even do it to horde. A lot of times it ends up getting me killed.
---
Cringe and pathetic
---
That BFA trailer really encompasses both factions hatred for the other and embodies the war aspect.  I get an immense sense of vigor and loyalty to the Horde everytime I watch it.  I can only hope as Classic ages this sense of open world war and battle stays.  I'll say it until I am blue in the face, this is what old AV felt like, and it was glorious.  A pvp BG that didn't need to end per say, just be a unified specific front for large scale pvp.
---
Where's my man's who is leveling by just killing boars on twitch?
---
In Moldova (the poorest country in Europe), the internet is WAY faster than anything I've experienced in the States.
---
I don't get it, it says World of Warcraft Classic and there is a big blue "Install" button right below it?
---
I would backstab you, If i could move.
---
Well basically, you are a bit of a turd and I'll explain why:
---
you're relying on the generosity and honesty of everyone in the group every time the need/greed thing comes up, so while you could make the ARGUMENT that rogues should be allowed to have the locked chests, I personally would not risk other people rolling on everything you want because you're obsessed with getting the chests. From a practical standpoint, I wouldn't want to behave like you. 
---
People might not be rolling on nodes *now,* but at higher levels, they very much do. Or at least they did last time I played in vanilla. 
---
I would not group with a mage that refused to make water, or a warlock that refused to summon. I would kick those people from my group immediately, and I would kick a rogue that refused to open chests.
---
ty
---
Mimimi?
---
Username checked out.
---
I agree with you on everything you said, and am glad you feel this way about such a beloved game. 
---
One thing I will say though...this will _probably_ change as Classic progresses. Right now everyone needs each other, but by phase 3 or 4...the “community” aspect will die down a good bit.
---
What lvl were ally? Don't find picking on lower levels than myself fun. Annoying when happening to me.
---
Ah, so I was wrong about the 48 hour auction
---
A 12 hour auction is 15%
---
A 24 hour auction is 30%
---
A 48 hour auction is 60%
---
So if you were putting that item up for 48 hours, you are right that the deposit was 30s.
---
The deposit is refunded if the item sells. If the item doesn't sell, you lose the deposit.
---
This is to encourage two things:
---
A) only posting items that will sell at prices that will sell
---
B) posting items that are worth more than their vendor price
---
Then what about a blacksmith that makes keys? You expect him to waste his keys on the group even if he loses the roll?
---
Never said I did kill him. He was in our area and I just /spit on a hored corpse. Then saw the name and had a giggle.
---
I'm remembering blizzard offered this too, but it was ridiculously expensive.
---
so an enhancement shaman? Also monks and pandaren are completely different things... one is a class one is a race... its like saying "it'd be really cool to see a tall person, but not a basketball player"...
---
Hover over the stats in your character screen.
---
Theres a text explaining them.
---
I’ll pay a gold if you’re high level!
---
To get better gear for world PvP
---
How much did the Ahn'Qiraj war effort inflate prices for the mats it needs?  Were there plenty of mats to go around or did it take actual effort to complete the turn ins?
---
I don’t understand why the rush to do all of this and level. The classic experience to me is taking your time and questing all of those zones and clearing those 5 mans that made vanilla so special. I’m only level 37 but I’m taking my time because I will not be leveling another class.
---
Blaumeux is pretty even. Only slight weight in the horde side. According to the census addon data.
---
Booty Bay is such a unique city. Nice shot!
---
It's a huge part of  vanilla, having fun with stupid shit like that. If the blizzard fun police got the locks who knows who they go after next.
---
I read world quest at first, ptsd almost kicked in
---
Quartz
---
I made good money in hillsbrad selling troll potions for people doing the elixir of agony quest, 25s a pop at one point.
---
Not my kill lol
---
Can confirm, I checked this, its like a 4 copper difference I believe.
---
Lowest was 16 and highest 28 (who kicked my ass) most were around my lvl and I actually died a fair amount of times since they were outnumbering me
---
Arthas is just a good guy turned bad, doesnt have to a darth vader rip off. Read the book, not many similarities to vader
---
Easily in the top10 worst classes to level, right?
---
I guess the upper one is a screenshot from someone else
---
That’s just an ad

Lost a crafting pattern I could have used on an alt because no one could use it. And I send any greens I win (greed wins obviously) to my mage to disenchant.
---
Nope, only windows firewall.
---
Probably still a solid grinding spot
---
Even to this day I hate doing it. However the feral Druid that swiped me with his shit covered paw after I took out a handful of mobs and was at 50 health reminded me, fuck that.
---
That may be so, but no one in trade will bite when I’m sellin.
---
Rogues are known to be a slow leveller. Worse than warriors too since warriors can just join cleave groups to 60
---
Someone's never heard of Laintime.
---
But there is no 48 hour in classic, right?
---
&gt;If you randomly buff other players If you randomly help kill a mob you dont get count
---
I do this on Mograine-EU when playing Ally for Horde.
---
If I see a Horde I help em out since at the end of the day, we both have one common goal so whats the harm of nudging them a little bit.
---
Forget about Spell Power. Intel/Spirit is way better overall. More mana, more regen --&gt; less time drinking and better overall xp efficiency.
---
*Holds up Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker*
---
if you love the classic ui id suggest just getting a move anything add on and using clique for healing. clique allows you do bind spells to just about any key and works with about any unit frame. heal bot and vuhdo are way too clunky and annoying imo
---
paladns with 8% movement speed
---
I'm a Rogue and don't mind rolling for locked chests. Not sure what the big fuss is. If I wanted to farm chests by myself I'd do it solo stealthing through SM.  
---
Of course picking strongboxes through trade for others is a different thing. Tips are nice there.
---
That is also what I love about tanking in classic.
---
You actually see a huge difference between a really really good tank and a tank that is just OK.
---
The difference between a tank that puts 100% of his Attention into tanking right now. Or a tank that is watching a Video while he is running the dungeon.
---
What would make me forever happy is to always have the Kind of tank that knows what he is doing and giving the run all of his Attention :)
---
It is not only about Holding agroo and pulling smoothly etc. it is also the small things like watching you healer's mana. Asking if some1 Need that and that quest so you would make a Little excourse from the normal route in order to let that Person finish his quest :)
---
All those Little Details make the difference and is why we truly appreciate great tanks!!
---
Sorry but I enjoy my Undead Warrior.
---
That's like a short video example of how to do it. Basically the little example is saying to do it this way, while the actual drop down is doing it wrong lol
---
Leveling a resto druid.  5 points in feral, rest in resto.  Living in instances.  This is so true.  Healing just the tank, it's not issue, but when the DPS is being morons and pulling agro or mages/warlocks are STANDING in melee range casting while getting cleaved, I'll burn threw my entire mana bar on a trash pull and have to drink up....making everything slow down.
---
But, when DPS is playing smart, they're taking incidental damage that barely warrants the occasional rejuv, may I'll toss one on a lock who's been tapping.  And once I hit 40 and got innervate, it was life changing.  Save so much money/mats in mana pots.
---
Perhaps there is a hidden decimal.
---

I would use the dagger and offhand. I think the stats are close enough to say the difference would be marginal. I personally love stacking as much spell damage as I can
---
Everyone here doesnt understand server restart and farming rare pets efficiently. 8 hours people. Pridelord and the Rake were both waiting for me uncontested

This gets the juices flowing on a Wednesday morning!

Love the idea of substitute, bit of juking in world pvp would be so much fun

Becouse there is where all the action takes places and will be a crazy pvp server.

You are that kid who screams just a prank after doing something dumb

That's nice!

Playing Alliance on Noggenfogger EU

I think it is horde favoured but it is still not updated on this website. Curious what it will show once it is updated

Sell on AH, buy in trade chat.

Becouse of the pvp aspect of it.

I'd be all about a spellsword class/spec of some kind. That and along with sword/shield DPS are my two biggest wishes.

Sadly, no, so I just laughed at his demise and walked off.
---
Ganking is part of the game on pvp servers bruh.
---
thanks!
---
I see you’re on Herod. That bitch was there the rest of the night.
---
two of those world drops are BiS for my class, im pretty much resigned to not getting them
---
I mean, right now there's not much you can do (on that level) to persist against a rogue that has the option to open on you whenever he wants to. There's just no "100% approved" way to defeat them. You're either lucky, or you're not. Even if you manage to set up a trap and he resists it, there isn't much you can do. 
---
I've won fights with half my health (I was regging) and I've lost fights I saw coming a mile away. There's some situations you can win but won't, and vice versa. Don't worry too much about it until you're starting to get your full set of skills.
---
See if you can get a +speed enchant on your boots if you have the gold; that tiny increase will help negate the leeway and make it easier. Also, slowest weapon with the fattest damage you can find
---
Typical alliance propaganda. Our homes, our identity, our very lives were ripped from us and we were left with nothing. We were you once, then you turned us away. You created the monster we have become, just as much as Arthas.
---
Always gotta hit the booty bay gangplank and the spot where people hearth in.

Ye I died a bunch of times hehe

Why delete it I feel like I missed out :(
---
You're welcome.
---
For your hunter alt, know that every item is a hunter's item.
---
It was added in 1.4, so no - it didn't exist since MC was out. Not sure how they are doing it in Classic since you have no guaranteed way of getting it before Kazzak.
---
Do you play on a PVE server?
---
You're right, it was 2.3, the zul amon patch.
---
I picked Horde over a decade ago because they looked badass and tough while alliance looked weak and prissy. I'm still Horde today because 25 year old me still thinks the same thing.
---
i liteally have this bug every time i use my 2h sword, it's so annoying when u finally got some cool looking weapon and ur character goddamn fights with a quiver lol
---
As I mage who is tailoring. Free bags for everyone. Free water and food.

Definitely not necessary though. Things that are necessary are tanks and dispels.

Lol I don't see where he spammed thunderfury.

I think it's fun. Also that he tried even more to convince that guy xD

There will be some overlap in days.

Well it's been a few years and my coffee table is still longer than Trump's Wall™ so yeah, that sounds about right.
---
*cries in Hunter*
---
Damn, trade chat was joking about thunderfury so I thought I'd join in on the fun. Sorry I guess.
---
Hunter having aesthetic pet choice anxiety.  I'm not camping for broken tooth, not worth it to me.  So for my cat I'm looking at the nice selection of 1.3 attack speed cats.  Trying to decide between the black skin(panther from STV), or black with white stripes(white stripped black tiger from darkshore). I am an female orc hunter.
---
I want some opinions on what's the better aesthetic.
---
Should I concern about changing the TTL to play and than changing it back again to the original value or can I just let it set to 128 without any problem? Does it affect anything in normal use?
---
Cant finish thunderfury until phase 3. Bindings still drop.
---
Finally a legit alliance who has a reason why they stayed alliance!
---
No, that wasn't added until much later though i don't recall when.
---
I don't. But I've spent about 10 gold in lvl 19 pvp BIS BoEs. They were just too good an investment to pass up on.
---
Can't help it, there are just enough mobs at the spot to farm for one guy :D
---
Sry, but hamstring spam is just wrong unless you are horde and fishing for windfury procs with a 2 hander that is not ravager. 
---
Short version of the reasoning: It is slightly less effective than cleave overall and you will never have so much rage that you can permanently spam cleave on top of your other abilities that also use rage. Both cleave and hamstring increase your chances of getting a ravager proc, but cleave unless it misses damages two targets as well. You also get more overpower procs from cleave.
---
It really isn't, my alt was a rogue and it wasn't half the struggle some posters around here claim it to be.
---
Same boat for me. Except I lost faith in Activision-Blizzard after the mess they called Diablo 3, and that the shareholders seemed to be making the game development more than the game designers, anyway, I digress). Yer, it's amazing to finally be back in Azeroth. I enjoyed a few expansions, but leaving the original world was a huge mistake in my opinion, and then flying mounts removed any world immersion. So not having either of those problems in Classic is a dream come true. I have made more friends in the last week of gaming than I had in the last decade playing retail/expansion. It's good to finally feel like I'm playing a RPG with/against other people again.
---
&gt; statistically from what I have noticed
---
So, not statistically.
---
LOL I'm lvl 35 and last night I noticed I had 12 gold and was overjoyed...
---
This wouldn't work as the characters would not be in PvP mode? Same for capitals?
---
I have no ideea what class you are...
---
That’s the kind of character I roll on dragon age/divinity
---
It already has graphic enhancements and high res textures compared to Vanilla so I doubt it.
---
And they aren't placed out like that.
---
Short, medium, long, very long. I will have to fool with it tonight because the only web resources are for retail.
---
But, the basics are the same - if it sells you get it back.
---
The AH cut is a flat 5% of what your item sold for.
---
You know I was at a party a few weeks ago and noticed they had a guitar in the corner of the living room. I was really hoping no one started playing it, but secretly I wanted to be that guy. So after about an hour I ask about the host general questions about the guitar and a few people overhear me ask. One girl turned her head and immediate says "will you play wonderwall for us?" And I said maayyybbbeeeeeeeeee.....
---
Sounds like a plan to me lol. Unfortunately in vanilla the "hardcore" players were such d bags when it came to raid comp. If I remember correctly, at least on the server I was on, it was about a month ish after the first raid clear that everyone started to become much more relaxed with raid comp and I could finally DPS as an ele shaman instead of having to either heal or just totem dance
---
Don´t listen to people bitching about prot tanks, they are glorious in dungeons. There is so much misinformation spreading though years and years of anti-pala memes.
---
Make sure you get consecration first and put the rest in prot and you are good to go to ae-tank pretty much anything. Just need to tell your mage and locks to give you a few ticks off your consecration before they can go ham and all is well. Many people also seem to forget how great the dmg of apala tank is. There hasnt been a single dungeon in which a non-mage/lock dps class did more damage than me.
---
Leveling solo will be a pain tho. You pretty much can´t kill any mob higher than you without literally punching ist for about 40-80 seconds (not exagerating). If you only do green mobs it´s fine tho, you can even ae grind big pulls of melee mobs with BoS, Conc, Ret aura and a shield with some kind of reflect mechanic or shield spikes.
---
Once you get reckoning (lvl 46) it´s possibly a whole ´nother world. You need to inform yourself about it´s mechanics tho.
---
Let his GM know too--unless they're a complete dick too, allot of guilds kick people for pulling shit like this.
---
Level 39 thinks are a nightmare to deal with in a time where people PvP  battlegrounds in a mishmash of gear without enchants most of the time.
---
No I get it and I wasn’t trying to correct anyone I was genuinely curious if I was just in the minority and wrong about it being Copper all the years haha
---
I never need on things I can't use. That's what the system is for right?
---
This is almost exactly what I was talking about. TY for articulating it better.
---
Thank god I'm not on Arugal. I'm fucking terrified all the way over here.
---
you need if you will equip it, if the caster doesnt equip it after rolling need they are as bad as the other needers
---
FUCK YEAH ~~SEA~~KING! 
---
..... well shit. You went from "Tiptoe in the tulips" to #NHHH real quick, didn'tcha? Youtube it and thank me later.
---
Sylvanas is the Saudi Arabia of the horde
---
Wait what do either of those have to do with being able to change your character's appearance? O.o
---
Fucking vending machine,  ADD diagnosed, Vurtne wannabe's.
---
It's hilarious.  I tell them to go back to retail or a PvE server and they stop complaining.
---
A second account just for banking alt? That sounds like Overkill
---
WHOA! That adds to the badass feeling factor for sure! I never noticed this... Then again I play with ambiance very low.
---
Thanks! Just a couple levels to go for me.
---
Might sound like it but it’s not. Warlocks aren’t delicate flowers. They can literally heal to full in almost an instant on their own if they think they might be in danger. 
---
No decent warlock is ever going to die in a dungeon from anything but a situation in which the whole group goes down. The lock starting a fight with some HP gone won’t change that.
---
Really?
---
You guys are gonna hate classic WoW. People are only gonna play the first couple of days for a laugh then go back to BFA after they realize its a much better game. Any day now... They'l come back. Any day..
---
The fact that his wife is just called "beaten corpse" made it even worse for me.
---
Remember world is actually a private chat, meaning some douche can put a PW on it and van anyone they don’t like, as in Kromcrush.
---
link ur achievs
---
Make the spell sword a tank. First clothie tank uses ice Armor. I’d go back to retail to play that tbh
---
Get Leatrix Plus im pretty sure it has an option to automatically take you out of form.
---
Too bad tab targeting and nameplates would give it away.
---
Ah right of course that's pretty clever, would this work with blessing of kings?
---
I just hit 16. :D
---
I was the orc.  My mouse batter died mid fight.  GG though.
---
Thank u for your time. I was thinking on stocking some of the mats for later sale (holding like 2-3 months). Any suggestion?
---
The game is called “classic” for a reason... updates of any kind besides releasing classic content would literally defeat the purpose.

A random guildy was making me some cloth armor and threw in these runecloth bags. Super stoked

Can I get the find fish skill in classic?

I mean we're probably on different servers.... that said I hate farming so wouldn't do it anyway haha but fair enough

It is known.

I find it quite annoying when someone runs up to me and I’m killing mobs and they just say water. I /sigh at them. Conjure a stack of food 2 at a time deplete all of my mana open trade with them they accept no tip no thank you and they run away every time. I’ve stopped doing it find a fucking vendor or tip Your mages.
---
Better yes, but easier is subjective.
---
"You are constantly outnumbered, you are facing a more aggressive enemy, and your allies are scared to help you. "
---
Interesting. I feel the same but just on Horde side. Maybe i play on the wrong PVP Server.
---
I don't think that is what he wants.
---
I think he wants a single icon for teleport, and if he hovers over the icon a drop down will appear where he selects which city.
---
Sorry yeah I meant the priest seems much slower. If I get in trouble I think I'm much more likely to get away with the priest, but for the most part I'm progressing much faster on the rogue.
---
Make an alt....?
---
How else do I check AH without having to stop questing?
---
It certainly brings the world to life with all the people running around, but they might have gone a tad too far.  STV is like devoid of mobs.  But I could just waltz up to the troll lore items I needed to collect at least.  The other faction seems more concerned with tagging mobs than they do with killing me.
---
Try playing shaman with sick 2h and report back. I will literally pull with auto attacks when big windfury proccs and there's nothing I can do about it
---
I also talk in game.  Thanks for the pointless reply.
---
You can move the chats around in the chat options menu, the /4 is just the 4th position chat.

No love for alliance scums 😁. Great work though, love it

Awesome! Sounds like my server.

---
For levelling, soloing and PvP druids are great, but are all tasks that require a broad skillset. When it comes to hyper-specialising, druids can't really keep up with other classes, you can be almost as good as a rogue, but you can heal yourself. Or you can be almost as good as a tank, but you're better DPS than an offtank prot who isn't required to tank for this fight, etc.
---
They are exceptional (and fun) healers though, they have some utility that is extremely valuable and their healing is more difficult to do effectively, but that can make it more interesting and rewarding in PvE.
---
Go Shadow when you can get Shadow Form.
---
Normally, I would just say for the horde. However, this was quite the story. You have my respect.
---
Well yeah but getting mats and/or the money for them is kind of why it is hard.
---
So that's really a thing. I was a bit confused when I could disenchant lvl 26 greens with my lowlvl priest alt who has Enchanting at 50.
---
I'm starting to think he switched on purpose so you wouldn't want to play with him.
---
Well turning into travel form will remove it tho.
---
Name him Mr. Wiggles, or hotdogfart I don’t know
---
Time to run Stockades.
---
yeah.. it works.. you could even do heroic strike (PLEASE DONT) and you would still get occasional ravager procs and do ok :P It's about the really small min/maxxes. In my group we even had a calculated table for when sunder armor was the better rage dump (it can also proc ravager and usually just after learning a new rank it is super efficient damage/rage). But I did not initially want to include that in my post above as it complicates things.
---
that's an instakick from group tbh. Hunters needing on stat items that help them is one thing. Rogues taking wands from mages is bullshit.
---
Nobody goes into a dungeon just because of a chest.
---
Probably vendoring.  Most leather and cloth mats are dirt cheap in the AH and are better off censored right now.
---
The goal of the dungeon is to get loot, guess what's in the chest? Chests have some of the most valuable loot so yes it's necessary to complete the dungeon and get max loot.
---

Its a marathon not a race. Get enough sleep!
---
1. BOP/BOE items you can actually *use* (so no, not a 2H sword or a wand). No reason to pass or greed roll even if there are other leather/sword/dagger users in the group if it's genuinely a huge upgrade for you.
---
2. BOE items that *everyone* knows are worth a lot of gold (cause they're going to be rolling need for sure).
---
Warriors can get invited to those groups...rogues cannot.
---
I play horde on Kromcrush and I'm loving the fight that the allies are putting up. I had like an hour long, 10v10 battle with some allies that were trying to quest in Stormgarde last week and it was so damn fun
---
As a lore-head myself, I don't care that some content is locked behind difficulty levels I am not willing to participate in. Not everyone can be a legendary hero killing the "big bad" who stands above them all.
---
Easy or Story modes for raids are killing the concept of a lore-heavy fantasy world. Why should a hard boss suddenly do less damage and forget about some skills only because the group asked him to go easy on them? That's almost as annoying as being "best buddies" with iconic NPC heroes from the story. I don't mind interacting with them for quests. But as soon as an MMO story elevates my character to the "You are the chosen one and without you, we would never succeeded on our mission", I loose my interest. Just because I am not really the only one when millions of other people got the same speech from these iconic characters. This is something more fitting to a theme park attraction where you get your participation token at the end just to feel better about yourself.
---
what a beast big love from Asscandy server
---
I give 1 free linen bag to &lt;=10s in starting horde zones. Much more fun than vendoring them now that I don't need linen. I have a couple alts and send all the linen to my main when I play them, so far I've given away 36 bags. My husband plays priest and buffs them all. Fun times :)
---
Saw literally this happen to someone yesterday, that hurt my soul
---
I picked up skinning (just vendor skins for extra $) and did several levels of grinding in the late 30s (raptors in theramore are a good one). I had just enough to get my mount at 40 and was back up to 100g by level 45. Also make sure to have a bank alt that you can send all your extra whites and other sellable items, and an auction house addon.
---
I dig this.
---
I knew I screwed up with professions, im mining/engineering right from start and dont want to drop engineering at this point since its already at 200/300, I knew I picked the longterm way but gold wise the profs are doing nothing for me at the moment.
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Got feared while mounted and the dots just ate away my hp with all the time in the world. Couldn't use racial or anything due to "can't use spell while mounted". It was torture.
---
Ah, right :)
---
"Didn't have a proper mobile "... " Just an old Nokia for calls and texting"...
---
Now that does sound like a proper phone if you ask me...
---
Rogue is great. I've soloed quite a few things, even picked apart groups around chests by myself.
---
Don't trust the horde!
---
I don't think people understand the cost of watervreathing potions and swim speed items when it comes to leveling lock picking. Most people don't know that "practice" chests are mostly underwater,surrounded by enemies, spread out, and contested by other rogues also trying to level their lock picking.
---
No. Barbershop came in WoTLK.
---
&gt; People are nuts.
---
They don't understand actions have reactions in this game. Hopefully whoever gets ninja'd by him is able to make his name go to shit and then he'll be fucked.
---
Yeah, that looks pretty legit. Reminds me a bit of some of GW2s warrior builds.
---
Exactly like mobs. Certain chests of a specific location have a drop pool given to it by blizzard. That's why a chest in Elwynn drops super low level stuff, but a chest located in a level 40 zone can drop like a 12 slot bag, but rarer. And it's also why a level 40 zone chest won't drop "Refreshing Spring Water". Within that pool of items, it's RNG what you get, with some items being much rarer than others.
---
Ebbn had a video of his resto specced &amp; resto geared guy doing fine &amp; farming with barkskin &amp; hurricane + dots.
---
People get mad for get killed on a pvp server lol
---
Mograine is very close to 50-50. The only server I know that is relatively balanced.
---
Dreadmist I think. From my experience its quite even
---
Way back when I had the staff of westfall with crusader on my 19 Twink, maxed engineering. God I was a fucking monster.
---
This. There's absolutely no reason to join a full server other than to have even more people camping the same quests you're attempting, oftentimes to your detriment. I don't know what masochistic tendencies some people have to just huddle in already crowded places.
---
Exactly. PVP is fun and a major part of the game imho.  That doesn't also mean it's not rage inducing at times. 
---
Honestly for me, the best part of WoW on a server that's static like on classic, is that one time you spot the motherfucker who killed you and camped you 10 levels ago and now you're higher than him and he's doing a super long escort quest and is currently at low health...
---
It doesn't get better than that feeling man.
---
Where tf you going bruh
---
You are slightly ahead of the average player, so groups will be more rare. Be sure to build a friend-list of people you can ask, especially at higher levels.
---
My Paladin is 60 since yesterday and finding people through LFG is almost impossible. You have to /who 60 and ask whoever isn't currently doing UBRS/Strath/Scholo.
---
Worth the time to get, but not take a proper screenshot 🤦‍♂️
---
Alliance still doesn't know how to take a screenshot, what a surprise
---
Paladin = Alliance
---
It's one of the few reasons I rolled warlock instead of mage too. I usually main (and have been since 07) a mage.
---
Where do you get this info from ? This is good new for me as a Mograine player.
---
People pay for summons to cities. They don't pay for summons to dungeons
---
Welcome home! I've always LOVED all the Music in Warcraft Universe....when you see it actually being played though its AMAZING.
---
I had a shaman run past me on launch called Critler..
---
Try Nethergarde Keep if you're looking for a PVE realm. I think it's pretty Alliance dominated though.
---
I have my macro to PW:Fort and /wave at the same time to players (plus one to /pat and PW:Fort pets) and I find that has a higher chance of getting me a thanks or a buff back but still low.
---
The real joy though was my first RFC run today though - we had a ninja looter warrior roll need on a cloth item in a party with two healers. Wouldn't respond to any of the chat messages either in general or calling him out so we just stopped healing him. After his second resurrect he started passing on rolls and all was right in the world. That sort of pettiness is the real reason we rolled priest.
---
~~Then the level 25 hunter that was carrying forgot to dismiss his pet for a jump and pulled so many baddies that we wiped. That was the second time it had happened that run. Hardest I laughed all day~~
---
No, you can't prep for self-rez.
---
Cuz the human bonus to rep works best if you spend the early game In teldressil doing the beef starting quests. Otherwise you get reduced rep later on doing low level quests.
---
Around level 50.
---
That is not relevant.  The popularity of /world channel is proof that it serves a function for thousands of players. The fact that thousands of other players don't use it is not an convincing argument against the functionality of a world channel.
---
Well it could be worse. Imagine you both would have rolled 100 and you still lost.
---
Spellsword mage sounds a lot like red mage from ffxiv and I dig it
---
I would say just get a second account that none of them know of. Put a character in this guild and just use it as a bank alt. Either that or just ignore them and do what you want. They will probably be jealous when you have actual good gear and they are still level 40
---
So I couldn't find if this was already asked elsewhere in the thread, but I'm playing strictly shadow priest as I hate/suck at healing and my original toon was a shadow priest. 
---
I love PvP and I know I'll be solid there, but I also wanted to raid a good bit once I hit 60. I'm seeing a lot of people talking about how raids will usually only take 1 spriest (if any) and I'm starting to wonder if I fucked up and should just reroll something else... are spriests really that bad for raiding? I'm not trying to do world firsts or anything I just want to raid and get better gear. Am I fucked?
---
Sweet I didn’t even have to ask
---
You killed a warrior though. Easiest class to kill in PvP. (Coming from a warrior) grats on surviving though! Wp.
---
because he needed to drink before buffing you.
---
Why should the subjective perception of "effort" overturn the community that clearly had some decent discussions because of said "low effort" post?  Surely if the community thought it was low effort it would've been downvoted or ignored.
---
Makes no sense.
---
I have it working now, for some reason the same version i downloaded yesterday didnt work the day before
---
Gratz! Now for my enchanter's sales pitch! Think of cutting through mobs with a simple Minor Impact (+2 dmg). Should only be a couple silver.
---
Trying to rank in pvp will be a pain.
---
If your actually serious about checking it out I can't recommend it enough (though I dont want to inflate expectations). This is a video that shows actual gameplay of the 'astral plane' endgame stuff:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jWmJh3Nbeg
---
That gear isn't for an alt but to sell on the AH once the BGs drop. Lvl 19 ppvp twinks are huge im vanilla and people will pay crazy amounts of gold for bis gear for their twinks.
---
Eye of shadow is definitely out, we have a benediction in guild.  Not sure if he farmed WS or Blasted though.
---
Come to Tw servers, the client is in eng and you get 27 ping  I’m from hk too and there’s a biggish guild with people all over Asia

---
Have my condolences and this upvote for your pain.
---
The loot from a mine (especially a rare one) is useful to me as a non-miner as well. I could be a blacksmith without mining, i could be an engineer, heck i could even throw it up on the ah and make decent gold from it. And before you say "selling it for gold doesnt count", there are plenty of people that use gathering professions for straight gold-making.
---

smaller faction gets faster BG queues
---
I've got a character with 2g at 16, and a bunch of stuff to sell. Pretty sure your doing something wrong
---
No, he would expect a thankyou ...
---
Yep! PVP is fun, and it can also be infuriating at times especially when there's no possible route to victory.  Just because someone "rages" because they had a bad night in STV doesn't mean they're somehow not cut out for a PVP server.  It just happens.
---
First bad experience was in Gnomeregan. Most of us wanted to do a full clear meaning no jump skip or anything and the warrior just kept ignoring us and by the end he was just annoying. The last ramp to Mekkatorque and he kept pulling and tanking mobs on the far right ledge close to the trench with all the mobs and he wiped us once. All was good although he had a spaz moment when we wiped and so we continued and near the end he charged and naturally reverted back to tanking near the trench and our hunters pet ran over to the ledge and aggro'd. Sure enough he lost his fucking shit calling everyone trash for being beaten in damage by a warrior even though he was level 35 and we were all level 29. He then said good luck beating it with out me and he left we then proceeded to reclear the dungeon with 4 people easily because the dungeon wasn't hard it was just the stupid warrior making it hard.
---
They can single target kill and quest fine, but they have to travel to each individual monster, can't get invites to cleave groups, have no high-uptime movement speed buff, and simple getting into dungeons can sometimes be a major challenge for any DPS class.  
---
On the surface, I'm sure they seem to level fine when you watch them dispatch an orange monster in 20 seconds... but we do that every 3 minutes.
---
Maybe they are hardcore RP and have blinders on that there is a massive population that wants to progress to new and different things. To do so they sometimes have to tasks that aren't their favorite. Like lighting a million fires in a row to use a new axe. Or mindlessly high alching because they want to cast some new spells, do a new quest, get better armor, or have some spare cash.
---
Summoning isn't a skill I particularly liked leveling but it sure did help me a lot.
---
Now there are some skills I do enjoy and do them for that reason. But they also have the benefit of *rewarding* me with xp, new quests, better gear, more gold, etc...
---
Yeah I tend to overthink this shit. I need to just level then worry about it. Just annoying.
---
How do you know the ratios?
---
Sure! 
---
The quest is certainly an impossible task if done alone at the early 30s since the elemental charms are level 38-39 mobs. I joined people’s party and the higher levels let me tag along. Some of them even traded the charms to help a fellow warrior out. liferoots are pretty cheap at the AH so I recommend buying them.  The trolltusks can be done solo, which I did. Take them on one at a time. I used elixirs to help me out. The droprate isn’t the best, but with time you’ll surely get it. Watch out for those Alliances! For Cyclonian, buy nature resistent elixir and get people! As an early level 30 and even level 40, Cyclonian is difficult to beat solo as he is a level 40 Elite. Good luck friend!
---
Yeah, that's the dark side right there.
---
Ashenvale for example, it's lvl 18-30. I suggest using a addon like Leatrix Maps: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-maps-classic
---
It shows the levels for each zone, any features you don't want (like fog clear) can be turned off.
---
How are your reputations looking?
---
Plus the ability to find a spot in any group while leveling is so pleasant...
---
immigrants always bring some of their culture with them, it doesn't matter if they come from BFA and don't know how to tank  or from pservers and think /world is the best thing since sliced bread...  you can't stop that.  They are here and they  join /world.
---
You could try to build a wall, but who's gonna pay for that?

I'd have though blizzard would have adopted this addon to allow players to customise the blizzard uni as they wished.

Dual-wielding two-handed weapons is pretty fucking badass though.
---
charge at the squirrels and shit on the side of the road as you run and you'll get there faster, and have rage when you get there.
---
only the wrath one's were unique, the originals were not, fortunately :)
---
Currently 52 with 5 days 7 hours.
---
YOU tank the dungeon then to get the chest or YOU heal the dungeon. See how that works? It took teamwork to get to the chest and all along the way the rogue didn't have to worry about anything meanwhile the tank and healer are working their butts off making sure you don't die. You talk about leveling lockpicking but have you leveled a warrior? Lockpicking is a breeze. And tanking with the DPS in classic is just awful 90% of the time since they don't understand threat. All dungeon it's basically trying to regain threat on different mobs when the DPS is split killing even with a skull up. Now you're going to sit here and say how hard lockpicking is? What a joke, next you'll complain about how hard it is to make poisons.
---
The problem is that I don't need drinks or portals. I always travel to the instance.
---
Raids can take 1 shadow priest because it increases all shadow damage by 15%. Make lots of Warlock friends and get them in your guild. It will become worth to have you as Shadow to your guild.
---
They can practically stunlock a mob to death.
---
But it's okay to play Balance druid. They are doo doo in raids since they take up so many debuff slots lol, you're right there. Everything else it'll work just fine.
---
I usually always have the most fun going from Barrens, few Ashenvale quests, Hillsbrad Foothills, then to Stranglethorn Vale. After that usually around Tanaris/arathi highlands.
---

---
So, I just conpleted Cortellos Riddle, which gave me a 14 slot bag. I almost abandoned the quest and I'm glad I didn't. I did a different quest and got a nifty stopwatch, and when I shared with my guild, they said "Oh yeah, that's a good one to get".
---
These are quest rewards that are really useful, but when searching for a list of valuable quest rewards like this, I get a couple mentioning OP limited use items and that's it. Is there a good guide anywhere on quest rewards worth getting?
---
Well it was a smart phone. But pretty darn solid. :)
---
Are you dumb? If you need something and it’s an upgrade you press need. If it’s not you hit greed. How is this worth a post?
---
Did you know if you turn cloth into bandages it vendors for more? Definitely worth taking from level 1.
---
The drop rates of trash from those mobs was different on pservers. It is not as good on Classic. I farmed it for 60min as a skinner can came away with just under 6g.
---
Desolace maybe.
---
Arms you get sweeping strikes at 30 which lets you kill 2 mobs at the same time and Mortal Strike at 40 which is god tier.
---
In my opinion Fury has a lot of talents that feel pointless early on and dont really do much. Like after the 5 crit, you pick between a chance to get an (1) extra point of rage from autos which is negligable or booming voice which increases the duration of battle shout by 1 minute... big whoop
---
Overall I think Arms is just better as a leveling spec.
---
What? I just trained for it at 30 last night
---
It's actually funny because I've ratted people before (I know, dick move) and watched them through their webcam.
---
Mostly due to PvP especially in battlegrounds from what I read
---
I too missed playing Dad in instances.
---
“It’s okay little one, you worry about having fun, I’ll keep the bad men away”
---
Guild name is work in progress, i think we have about 350-400 active members now! I think we are by far the biggest on the server and looking to start raids asap
---
It's not terrible. Ive healed deadlines at level 18. Just bring water, or a mage.
---
Nope, it's a solid cc ability. It also allows skips on certain pulls as it doesn't generate threat or aggro anything.
---
We are having hunters roll on them / bid, then it is becoming an open bid for everyone to support the guild bank.  It really is one of the best ways to do items like that.  A bag is a bag it's not game changing but why not get helpful funds if people want to bid war
---
Already done, we raided once the enemy cities Stormwind/Ironforge, but due the layering its so empty.
---
I do get it I raided with a shadow priest he pulled great numbers one he got anthema or w/e he was a nightmare. My point was if your good at your class and do what you need raid leaders will bring you.
---
40 people are a lot of spots to killed and not every player is at the same skill level. You bring the best fit not the most optimal meta.
---
Plus its classic why take it so seriously with a well geared group you can down Rags with 32iah people.
---
Nice. Now camp him into oblivion. Warrior has a shit life, make it worse for being a prick.
---
Lol I swear I just trained for it last night when I got 30
---
Honestly, I usually click through quest text pretty quickly. This made me stop and really contemplate the emotions behind the scene. It's more than just clearing a quest out of our quest log.
---
Thanks, this series is phenomenal. Keep up the great work and I hope you get many commissions out of this!
---
If it makes you feel better, a lot of the meats are for alliance only recipes. Horde kinda gets screwed on cooking.
---
I don't get it either. People spout that off as some unbreakable law. Yet we're getting content released in phases? Do people not understand WTF they're saying?
---
Let the tank build some threat before you unleash your full dps then.
---
slaughtered like the pig he was
---
Lol you have a dest seated issue with nightwing...wanna talk about it? Did he touch you? Show me on the doll
---
After skimming, seems like mortal strike from arms is considered a must have, but you don't get it until 40. Some guides I read tell you to start fury and spend 1g respeccing to arms when mortal strike becomes available.
---
You know he's referring to the warrior in the story right?
---
Nah, I started a week late and hit 35 last night
---
I haven't rolled one so I'm not 100% positive and honestly you can play whatever you want. As far as I've heard from everyone though cat form isn't viable for raiding it's sub par dps..resto is the way to end game but don't hold me to that
---
Arathi Highlands, Desolace, anyone know if  badlands is worth it for ally?
---
This guy gets it
---
I'd grind SM for a few more levels. Desolace quest ramp up quickly from lvl 33 mobs to 35-37 and the quests are far and few between. ALOT of running. South Shore maybe a better option? I stuck at SM until 37 anyway
---
Warriors use ranged weapons ? Why?im very curious
---
Damn, i dont know why I didnt think to look on amazon..
---
yeah maybe not the green one but that's the idea
---
I never understood this. By default, A and D are both strafe and turn, depending on whether you're holding right mouse button. So, yeah, I just use A and D for both. The default, unless i'm forgetting I changed something
---
Im not the GM
---
should it be / cast aspect of the cheetah! /say on your left. That way if its already up it won't take it down. Or does that not work in classic.
---
Remember multiple jumps is a way to saying thank you. I had to keybind /thank you because I wasn’t sure people were understanding the jumping.
---
We've come to find that easily digestable meme images tend to get easy upvotes. The reason we want to keep the numbers of meme posts down (even if it occasionally leads to shutting down a discussion in the comment thread) is that it would inevitably lead to the sub being a hoard of image posts when said images barely relate to the core topic of the subreddit. We're not here to "kill memes we don't find funny or those that lack effort". Free reign for memes would stifle other sort of posts
---
There is no reliable census because they're all built on user submitted data but if you run a single census  on each side prime time it's usually closer,  I think more ally just understand what a waste of time it is trying to pvp while leveling with no honor
---
Unless you're trying to speed level, leveling new skills is easy enough.
---
They've already said there will be crossrealm BGs. Queues overall will likely not be that bad.
---
I guess, because both did not plan on wearing it. So they both did not need it. If you then all decide to roll need I understand. But if 1 of them would have wanted to wear that staff. Then let him have it. And make him wear it as well.
---
At level 18: Camp Taurajo, then Stone Talon, then Ashenvale. Should get you close to 30, at mid-late 20s go to Thousand Needles or Hillsbrad.
---
You can't be the dwarf, Butters. I'm the dwarf!
---
You misunderstand me... 1 day 4 hours played at level 40 is fast even if you're rushing to 60, it is damn near impossible to get to 40 that fast if you spend most of your time doing something that doesn't even provide experience.
---
Thats how i feel.
---
i mean... that's pvp
---
It's like Blizzard is allergic to fun. 😐
---
Exactly! Man, spellbreakers were one of the coolest models in that game
---
I wasn't telling you to chill out. I was telling you to stop being a prude and enjoy the harmless banter. Whether you chill or not isn't at question.
---
It was very obvious that we were having a harmless dialogue from the beginning.
---
There is a very real chance in my opinion that they ride the wave and possibly take the "easy route" and release BC because they know how much everyone loved it. Nothing wrong with that I guess but to me it would indicate they're scared to be creative and go in a new direction.
---
BGs are cross server, the balance on your realm doesn't affect that.
---
Something like that perhaps. Thats kind of been a theme of Warcraft for a while now. It seems we're becoming more and more alone in the universe. No Guardian of Tirisfal. No Aspects. So many magical artifacts are now useless. (Effectively) No Titans.
---
It's becoming more and more dependent on mortals to protect the world.
---
Can you tell me where it is? It'd be worth the run as Horde to save time leveling mining, possibly.
---
&gt;  This is as much an upgrade for me as it is for you 
---
I am 95% sure you are just trolling, but in case this isn't sarcasm, I feel compelled to let you know that inst the case. At all.

---
The two mages and the priest get crit% off of Int. Hunters do not.  
---
The chart I linked assumes the character is level 60. At SFK levels 10 Int is big. Hunters also have cloth *and* leather available to them, whereas Mages/Priest/Warlock are looking exclusively for cloth.
---
The +2 agility on the belt doesn't even factor in.  That is a relic of vanilla itemization, not an indicator that Hunters and Rogues should use this item.

Let’s hope it is

*Paladin fails to kill Horde*

*Paladin Bubble and HS to safety.*

At the moment I’m a little bit ahead of u, I’m currently lvl 28. After doing most of the barrens I did stonetale mountains which was decent followed by a bit of ashenvale. Ashenvale is not the most enjoyable zone, I only went there to do BFD dungeon and now I am in thousand needles which in my opinion is one of the best zones for horde levelling. It has some of the best quests and is very different from any other zone.
---
But why they all do this ? Is that a stupid generation thingy or just a troll ?
---
We need to finance a study on this.
---
both sides gank.
---
both sides run from 1v1's but will fight a 1v2 regardless of class
---
both sides have elite pvp skillers
---
both sides will kill you while you are half health killing a mob
---
in my experience horde are slightly more aggressive in general  but overall I'd say the idea that alliance only fight in groups of 10 or that horde are bloodthirsty griefers is not true. Everyone on a pvp server is out for blood, otherwise they wouldn't subject themselves to the player environment here.
---
Sure that wasn’t aspect of the cheetah?
---
I played in vanila and i don't remember it being a Thing then.
---
But i also remember it from private Servers, and it was a clusterfuck. 
---
I can See how it can be very usefull.
---
I don't use it personally though.
---
Bu you can also not expect blizzard to care about Player made Channel, even If they easily could, but then where Do you draw the line
---
Why's it puntable's fault? He did all he could to lose the roll. OP just sucked too much to win it. Don't blame others for your own bad luck.

for the "at a glance" information i like to use two addons that track CDs. One is TellMeWhen - i usually set it up so that is shows a picture of said spell/skill with a timer once there is a CD and dissapears otherwhise  
---
The second addon WeakAuras is for those stuff that you really want to flash out that the CD is over (like Intercept in PvP). Im usually setting it up to flash the spell/skill icon in the middle of the screen for a second or two. Obviously cant use many cds like this as this might be highly distracting.
---
I am not much of a raider but I am not sure I understand your angle here.
---
I'm having a fantastic time with enhancement as a solo shaman, but when it comes time to do group content I throw on my intellect gear and reserve my mana for casting healing and utility spells, because it just contributes so much more to the group even with no points in restoration. As a healer I bring all the same utility, but my heals are just so much a better use of mana than my damaging spells.
---
It seems like anyone who spend the majority of their time doing group content (instead of primarily soloing and grouping occasionally) would be well served by specializing in restoration.
---
Not all of us are bad... This coming from the ENHANCE (yeah, I’m that brave... Or that stupid) Shaman on Bigglesworth. I’ve been questing in Shimmering Flats (Thousand Needles) and gotten ganked by hunters and Druids CONSTANTLY. The funny thing? Frost Shock, Ghost Wolf and I’m on your ass. I may not hit hard, but my Crits, do... And when Windfury hits, you’re going bye bye. 
---
I don’t fuck with people because I’m often playing while my 2 year old is on my lap also playing. But I’ll let you know something... He loves when I chase down “the bad guys” and treat it as a joke... And I love to make him laugh.
---
You should write a blog off encounters like this 👌Great storytelling
---
So good. 
---
I'm on the other side of the fence leveling a warlock but I'm pretty passive. Haven't picked any fights and usually I'll just fear someone jumping me and run off. 
---
But the rage man... I know what you mean. Twice now I've thought, nah fuck you fuck this and hit my soulstone and just trounced some idiot who thought he could pick me off. MAN that feels good.
---
They're not fun anymore. Will never happen.
---
Hamstring kiting is viable in classic, you just have to do it differently. It's also not really worth it since the mobs don't hit nearly as hard as they do on most pservers.
---
Worked well for runescape, don't see why I wouldn't here.
---
It's been established that whilst the nostalgia is nice, classic is doing well for more than just that, having a Dev team follow the classic philosophy could be dun
---
Other classes than rogue who don't have BS keys are unable to open the locked chest but are demanding the chest loot.
---
Yes, but I really feel a lot more powerful with each level I gain! /flex
---
What about now?
---
Lol no they cannot.
---
yeah, you never know who you're gonna get on either side as on the other end of the keyboard... there's a human. I was killed by an alliance druid yesterday (im also a druid and much lower level) after waving to him/her. Happens, even with the unspoken druid rule.

Ahh Glad to see you're doing well Ionlyheal. I've seen you around and I'm pretty sure we've done some quests together.

Thats fast! took me 10 days of casual playing to hit 20.

Have to roll a new server to meet up with friends though &gt;&lt;

Asking for a friend.

On a separate note, I actually am a huge advocate for preparedness. I have all my skills level up as high as I can.

Cooking, fishing, first aid, herbalism, alchemy. I have potions, bandages, regs for vanish, crafted food, etc.

Im 22y old and classic is precisely what I’ve been missing not just from mmos but most other games I’ve played. Its not the community aspect that I was missing tho ive come to realise just how much better it makes a game feel, its not just the immersion although its also amazing (oddly enough I like having to read quests to know where to go) nor is it any sense of nostalgia because this is my first time playing wow, its quite simply because it feels rewarding. That is what I feel is lacking in all the games I play, things arent just readily available you have to work for them, its not instant, its not quick, its not easy and i love it. No dumb cash shop either, some items actually feel prestigious I look at some peoples gear and think “wow that must have been hard to get” and not just “thats a walking 100€ bill”. Sorry for the small rant the TL;DR is im young and I freaking love classic
---
See, this is where retail should have gone. Greater complexity and more options, not the opposite.
---
Much easier to take a picture with a polaroid and scan the image afterwards imo.
---
It's rather easy, assuming the tank/group isn't over-pulling.
---
Rejuvenation and Regrowth allows you to abuse the 5 seconds rule all the time.
---
That's like 3 xpacs later
---
Yes. It was harder in actual vanilla, because nobody had 1.12 gear.
---
Yea those 2 and 3 button classic rotations are ttttttoooouuuuugggghhhhhh
---
At least he was honest. People do shady stuff in dungeons all the time to need on things they don't really need. 
---
5 greens found the same time, so 5 rolls going on at the same time. You can be sure someone needs an item in hopes of no one noticing. Then if called out, they just say "oh sorry, missclick, you can just roll on it if you are so angry about 2g". 
---
People need on off spec gear that they never intend to use all the time. They just sell it to vendor right after the run. 
---
You can find tons of examples of this.
---
This is the point. Everyone's basis for measuring a class is raid performance. "Oh (insert unpopular spec here) is shit  in raids, just level something else." Heads up, not everyone cares about raiding, or dps meters. Enjoy yourself or quit, simple as that. (:
---
I have have everything except rings and trinkets to swap, I bought 14 slot bags so I keep my last bag for gear and dont run into problems .
---
My day is going pretty well so far, but I appreciate it. You have a good one as well.

---
If you think that the actual battleground itself is better with crossrealm then you are flat out wrong. Crossrealm killed the soul of BGs and took a lot of the fight out of them.
---
Arguing for crossrealm because of queue times is the only reason for them. 
---
I think that the servers are going to be large enough to support single server BGs and having single server BGs would encourage people to roll with the underdog faction.
---
I vote for single server BGs for the initial BG release. Try them out for a few months at least and give people a taste. Then release crossrealm if the people are calling for them.
---
STV Hemet Nesingwary skirmishes. People don’t form a raid but you can usually find 10 horde fighting like 10 alliance a couple times a day
---
bad lands is pretty lame - theres only a few quests and the camp for the elementals has like 20 + people at it all day on my realm. I regret going there. If you do there, even though its against my play style, id suggest getting a levelling guide just to make it worth it. Just spent the last couple days there with minimal progress.   
---
42 now and got like 8 bars from the first few quests in feralas horde free due to the low drop rate of the nagas south of feathermoon strong hold. It was odd to see how fast I grinded xp with no horde around
---
Not leveling arms, so don't have tactical mastery; I stay in defensive stance.  
---
If DPS are constantly pulling mobs off you because they're hitting something other than the primary target, that's not your fault.  Just make sure you aren't wasting rage on stupid stuff like rend or heroic strike.  Stick to revenge, sunder, and you can throw in a shield block if revenge isn't up.
---
By the way, when your druid gets swipe he will have an easier time tanking multiple mobs than you.
---
maybe they could have increased the raid difficulty. but to call it a huge mistake is silly because people dont want vanilla because the "raids were so good" or some shit.
---
That’s actually how I read it at first
---
This has been a thing since cameras could upload to the internet. People leave their computers to take a picture of their computer 😂
---
Especially because that troll area is farmed by both factions, so you are fighting over respawns and the random Wpvp.
---
I'm nowhere near getting mine as I grind through 39. Thought I was being frugal and was barely halfway there. Decided to big brain AH stuff this morning to try and flip for profit.
---
Currently wondering if I'll be very sad when I get home or much closer to my mount
---
I will never understand people complaining about PvP on a PvP server. 
---
Don’t give me the honorable or not fair argument either. Not everyone does this but many do. If it bothers you play on a PvE server and wait for BGs where it’s more fair.
---
I started on a PvE server because I wasn’t sure if you wanted to deal with this since I always level behind the curve.
---
Welcome to comic books in the 90s!
---
It’s not the fact that they take up a debuff slot. It’s the fact that they run out of mana faster than a shadow priest and have no way of getting it back besides using the one spell they were brought to the raid in the first place to use on a healer.
---
And in contrast to that you have retail where you can interact with pretty much every item while in freaking flight form! It's IMBA as fuck and I loved it.
---
Undead is still arguably better for pvp. I would even say that it's the best race in the entire game for pvp, hands down. Wotf is amazing, and unlike the shitty gnome racial, it doesn't have a cast time.
---
LookihgForGroup id an official *global* channel just like WorldDefense FYI.
---
I know what all do. Just didn’t remember shamans have frog/hex also hibernate from druids
---
Sweet thanks
---
Something I said when i was still playing vanilla.
---
Warriors have nothing outside of "Hit things" or "Get hit by things" there is absolutely 0 non-combat abilities on a warrior.
---
It definitely makes the class feel stale when not actively fighting anything.
---
This. 100%. Just need to remember you bring more than a mage. You arent just damage, you are more like a flex. Maybe the current boss does more damage to the raid. Might have to spot heal the fight.
---
reporting for duty - 1hour more on the clock - glad this subreddit is not dead and it got enough content to keep my turkey under control
---
Because nobody knew shit about the game.
---
It was also harder because talent design was way worse and nobody knew what they were doing, a lack of progressive itemization is really only a small part of it.
---
What? Half the people clearing Mc aren’t even 60 yet and the other half are in greens. Just stop.
---
WHERE DID THE SHADE GO?!
---
Enhancement shaman is pure melee in retial at the moment, only way he can survive is to attack to gain mailstrom so he can instant heal otherwise it is as squishy as a clothie. Damage it deals is elemental/fire but done through melee as well. So yeah, modern shaman. Only totems you can use at the moment are earth bound and capacitor which are more like a short term spell then a drop and forget buff which was in classic. So yeah, just what you described.
---
Its unique
---
I have been playing this game for almost 15 years now and I can say that this behavior is not new. People did this in vanilla and every expansion since. The DeSean you haven't seen it lately on retail is because everyone is on their flying mounts 99% of the time only dismounting to kill mobs they need.
---
Exactly this. 5s a stack for linen is reasonable, on my server they are all now 48s a stack, all the same seller
---
STV Hemet Nesingwary skirmishes. Couple times a day but I haven’t been in a raid for it
---
As a warrior,  can confirm this is a thing

Weird, I fished for a bit last night and didn't have any issues. Did catch some bolts of Runecloth though, that made my day as a tailor.

How do I get a sexy horde/shaman emblem next to my name on here?

I think I'll probably leave it and go back later when I've got the stuff and grab the nifty stopwatch, it's a nice little trinket.
---
You'll waste everyone's time with that attitude.
---
Damn, I've heard that before but TSM is so annoying to configure, do you know any videos or setup guides just for that portion of it?
---
It’s unique, if you have one then you can’t have another.
---
The point of my post is that BOTH factions are complaining from what I see, on multiple servers, about STV fights being one sided.
---
On my server if horde start attacking alliance the alliance will literally roll over and not quest while horse are out and about killing. I have tried to get a group together to push them back and not let them just roll through everybody. But in general chat there are people who will say there is no point in fighting them and just leave the zone and go somewhere else. There is maybe a handful of people who will group up and try to fight back but other will just let them steam roll them while questing.
---
Unless that Tauren just happens to be a Druid in Cat form stealthed....
---
That was only true for the first week. You think after clearing it they sat on their ass and went in the next week with the same gear? No. They levelled up, they got prebis, they got Ony gear. 1.12 gear. Gear that's absolutely overpowered for MC.
---
Ikr?
---
I spend more on brezzes than mages spend on portals. I'll take maybe half a dozen portals before I'm 60 but I brez all the time, multiple times a day
---
Surprised to see my home of Blaumeaux on that list. I have only been a part of a queue once last week.
---
Progressive itemization is not what makes MC easy.
---
 15 years of knowing the fights, 15 years of running much more mechanically complicated raids, and 15 years to solve the vanilla meta did this. 
---
Having 3 extra STR on boots did not.
---
Played horde only for blood elves, easily my favourite campaign from Warcraft 3 so it was an easy choice.
---
When I say "would've" I put more emphasis on the v sound. There is a distinct pause when I say "would of" between the words.

---
i'm playing rogue and have had no trouble finding groups. i don't think the people following the "meta" are nearly as common as you claim.
---
What you mention is that Rank 4 Heal is more efficient than Greater Heal, which is false.
---
Heal and Greater Heal have the same 3 second cast time.. How are you possibly missing with one but not the other?
---
Or are you implying that a heal can actually *miss* your target, because that's literally not possible.
---
Calm down Thanos!

Int/Stam &gt; Int/Spirit for healing. Paladins never get a chance for regen to kick in unless your tank is really over leveled/over geared and in that case you barely need gear anyways. Stamina at least lets you survive a hit or two. Later (SM+) prioritize +healing/int/spell crit.
---
I tank almost exclusively in defensive stance. I have very little use of battle stance for tanking. Berserker stance pretty much only to to activate berserker rage. Battle stance maybe if I want to charge in and start with a thunderclap, then switch to defensive. The important stuff to keep aggro can all be used in defensive stance so there really isn't much need for battle stance in my opinion.
---
Damn I gotta read more quest text...
---
Is there a mod to make the scrolling text maybe 3x as fast but not instant?
---
It a perfect world, everyone will know about the LFG channel, and use it exclusively when LFG.
---
Nothing in this world is perfect.
---
Nothing in this world will ever be perfect.
---
As long as there is doubt as to if everyone is seeing, and/or, using the LFG channel, the Trade channel will be used.
---
Just last night, i was in a group.  Long story short, 2 people in my group learned about the LFG channel.  35+ odd levels into the game, and only now discovered the existence of the LFG channel.
---
The problem, essentially, is that no one is auto-joined to the LFG channel like they are the Trade channel.   If blizzard were to create a default chat tab, and auto join this tab to the LFG channel, this would go a very long way into getting LFG people out of the trade channel.
---
Wonder this aswell
---
Lost a Dal Rend MH to someone who already had it and thought it was the OH he was needing on...that was cool
---
Just lot mine to a 92 when I rolled 91.
---
The BoE's in those chests do. You understand how that whole system works right? See most dungeons have a few BOE blues that are exclusive to that dungeon. Now they can drop from mobs at like a .5% chance OR they can drop from chests or bosses at an increased chance I wanna say like 5%-10% but I honestly can't remember.
---
So if you want that specific loot it's absolutely necessary to open chests. Since the groups objective is to get loot, the rogue needs to help towards that.
---
Yes, they did. Pretty much every guild wiped at least once (except for apes).
---
I'm not sure man, it sounds like something a group that is going to raid Stormwind would say

How do you get SM armor?

He is talking about /played time not actual days.

Yeah this kind of this is as old as time. Hell this even happens in the modern game pretty regularly.

Or maybe molten core is just easy compared to the mythic raiding these players are accustomed to? You can't act like this content is supposed to be Uber hard. It's a normal mode raid

Yo it’s my friend who introduced me to the game’s birthday, I wanted to send him a fun gift in game. I figured I might just throw him some coin but does anyone have an idea for a fun item? He’s a level 18 undead priest. I’m a noob so not too familiar with the game, I know there are pets and stuff but I’m around his level so I’m not super wealthy.

It's not an attitude it's a response, though I'm more likely to leave and carry on with my day.

I was alliance in vanilla, horde on P-Servers, and now alliance again. I just like the zones more.

I am saving fishing and cooking for when I get to 60. Because then I got some relaxing to do. I just conjure my shit anyway for leveling.

Or maybe they were just a bunch of kids that rolled rogue after watching a youtube video. Now they are back in school or bfa.
---
Downvoted by someone that has never had to level lock picking lol

Im horde and i never attack alliance players that are half health fighting a quest mob, but alliance players do that shit all the time to me. luckily i am a druid and get away 95% of the time.

It’s not fabricated, maybe he wasn’t eating maybe he was just sitting on the ground I don’t fucking know but it is what happened. Y’all some hateful motherfuckers.

made a horde on the server ! UD warlock !

The mage could have been in combat already for some action OP didn’t notice or see, like buffing a player.   Then all OP sees is the frost nova and not what happened before.

Good for you, fellow Ally.  Now, he's either going to not quest in Un'Goro anymore, or, he will be looking for you.  But you are ready.

Undead will be OP PvP because they're the only race with a racial skill that cancels Fear. Shadow priests and warlocks are hell for every class because Fear is bonkers in Classic.

On pvp realms there will always be more horde than alliance just for the pure fact that horde racials are better for pvp than alliance.
---
Bro you just posted cringe
---
One of the few things which I think Rift did very well was creating new and good class fantasies. As you could be a ranged warrior, melee mage, a bard, a tinker, and many other spec combinations which made it so you could play what you wanted.
---
Nah, that’s just us late 20s folks being kids again.
---
When I first got to STV it was my first time actually being in an actual contested zone. I came back to this game for the world PVP. So I played a game on my rogue. I couldn't kill quests mobs unless I stole it from a horde already attacking it. Was a very very fun game.
---
It's mostly the dps' fault for not letting him get aggro. If you don't give the tank a solid 2-3 seconds to generate rage and aggro on the mobs you're always going to pull the mobs off him.
---
It just cycles a bunch of /who queries and records name/level. Only works for your own faction but basically works as
---
/who warrior level 1 name between a-c
---
/who warrior level 1 name between c...z
---
/who warrior level 2 name between a-x...
---
cycles through level/naming and then moves onto classes.
---
My life as a *Druid*. I feel your pain.
---
I think he means 1 day 4 hours on only lvl 40 (time played this lvl). Total time played is probably a lot more.
---
I think outfitter might be what you are looking for
---
Yeah I would love for them to expand within the confines of the 60 cap and existing zones. I think the problem MMOs have it they scale things up and you get ridiculous power creep. FFXI is perhaps not the best model of follow, but the game was 75 cap for at least 5 or 6 years and they helped characters get better not through levels but through gear. This has pluses and minuses but a big plus was a lot of your content doesn't just get made completely irrelevant.
---
I use this one...
---
/equip name of weapon
---
/equip name of shield
---
/cast defensive stance
---
Get home??? There's your problem loser.  Quit your job and you'll have it tomorrow .
---
The Alliance enslaved the Orcs and tried to genocide the Blood Elves! I cheered when I saw Teldrassil in flames. Hope a bazillion Nelfs died.
---
I didn’t see his comment either but he probably recommended farming venture co foreman or stv for the lunch box drop, it’s a 12 slot bag.
---
Yeah, on one hand I'm glad bags are affordable for everyone but as a tailor I'm depressed that tailored items are selling at borderline sweatshop prices on my realm.
---
Switching to shield:
---
/equip [shield]
---
/equip [main]
---
/cast Defensive Stance
---
/startattack
---
Switching to 2h
---
/equip [2h]
---
/cast berserker stance (or balanced)
---
/start attack
---
Adults play alliance and 14 y.o. edge lords play undead rogues so I played alliance
---
High quality imo.
---
I think there’s a good chance we’ll see everything up to wrath of the Lich king. After that... I have a hard time seeing a lot of people pushing for cata.  
---
Me personally, BC is probably my “ideal” version of WoW.
---
My first glorious PvP experience in Stranglethorn Vale was just last night at 37. I am never the one to open, I just quest around and do my thing and also really hate it when coward stealth classes won't 1v1 me but lurk in the shadows waiting for me to pull three mobs and get under 30%. 
---
This is exactly what happened yesterday, but I wasn't the victim of assault. A nearby 31 druid was killing tigers and had probably 200 hp when a 36 rogue suddenly jumped him. The poor druid couldn't do anything to defend himself so I feared and dotted the rogue. He was almost dead but seeing where it went, in a last attempt to finish off the druid, he literally used everything. Vanished, interrupting my shadowbolt, sprint, popped a potion even. Alas, it was all in vain, as after 2 seconds another shadowbolt melted his face for 300 damage.
---
Choose your faction wisely, bitch.
---
I would kill for a Warden-spec for Rogues.
---
Hell, we have Maiev as a rogue hero in Hearthstone.
---
Of course it's possible why would it not be.
---
No worries, thanks so much!
---
I would say welcome to classic where the QoL improvement is having enough money to fly from Stormwind to Ironforge in order to be able to take a pee break instead of taking the tram.
---
On topic though... not sure if there is such an addon. If you find it post it here as well please. Every druid/pally/shaman will love you. :)
---
Sounds like the rogue was having fun. Makes STV a nice and tense affair.
---
I have exactly the same story, but as a lvl 36 horde tank warrior. And yes, it is extremely satisfying to finally get back at these DAMN MAGES INTERRUPTING MY LEVELING.
---
Cheers OP!
---
I'm reading what you wrote perfectly clearly, you apparently are not. I'm only responding to a portion of what you're writing. I know both sides complain about the other side, it's funny to me hearing my friends complain about getting ganked, and then as soon as we group up we start killing everyone we see. It's funny.
---
But that's only part of what you've been writing. You've also said that there is no reason to kill someone other than to be a dick, and "The problem here lies mainly with number 2. Rarely is it a fair fight with an Allie/Horde. It's usually either faction running up for no reason while one guy is fighting mobs and killing him. Most of the time without even taking the mob."  It seems to me that you don't like what people are doing.
---
One of the main things that kill the retail story line for me is that the Argent Dawn and Cenarion Circle still are friendly to the horde.
---
I love the flavor of a warlock with 10 summoned imps and just offing one at at time to heal the tank.
---
Skull kill
---
Cross second kill
---
Moon poly
---
Those are the biggies/most common.
---
Also circle sap
---
Square trap
---
Diamond banish
---
Then again use whatever and communicate what you mark like but best to use the generally accepted method.
---
That's a big if. Whales are less likely to quit.
---
&gt;The Alliance enslaved the Orcs and tried to genocide the Blood Elves!
---
Actually retarded.
---
The absolute legend
---
If specs are good enough to do the content, what makes them bad? 
---
The word "bad" has negative connotations. We should start saying "good enough" instead
---
Agility gives rogues attack power and critical strike chance.
---
Strength gives rogues attack power.
---
Agility and Strength give same amount of AP, but agility also adds crit chance, which is why agi &gt; str.
---
As for damage, 14 attack power roughly equates to having 1 more dps. So when comparing weapons, if you ignore other things like attack speed etc, 1 dps = 14 attack power.
---
&gt; I was also throwing Renew on the tank either before he pulled or right after the fight if he'd taken minimal damage.
---
Try not to do this. Renew is very inefficient, plus it will stop your mana from regenerating for 5 seconds. Furthermore, if you renew before the pull, it's very unlikely that a tank at that level will be able to get aggro on all of the mobs before your Renew ticks and generates threat, which means you are more likely to get aggro (and it is then harder for the tank to build enough rage to build enough threat to get the mobs off you, which means you spend more mana on emergency healing yourself... you see my point). Stick to big burst heals and letting your mana regenerate while wanding. If you're still oom, start looking at crowd control to reduce the amount of damage the tank is taking.
---
The reason BOTH sides complain and BOTH sides gank is because BOTH sides are compromised of some people who want to quest and some people who want to gank and the gankers kill the questers.
---
Keep an eye out for people being chased, tag the mob off them and vanish if it’s too high.
---
So he can't knowingly grief people anymore? Aw dang!
---
I so love Pre-Cata BB.
---
Buy what?
---
Not a big commenter but each "/"should start on it's own line
---
I played enhance shammy back in vanilla. I'll tell ya, when your geared at 60 your burst DMG will dummy most other classes. Enhance shammy has a two down sides, the first being you have a few seconds of incredible power then you fall off quick. The second being everyone else knows this and if they play smartly they will know that when you drop totems you are about to unleash hell. You will simply have to learn to adapt to this. In BGs it is much easier, especially if you can get a hunter buddy to run around with.
---
I would've casted Rend then switched. You can't use your dot in zerker stance.
---
We get a pittance of gross green wands in the 30s, i'm at 37 and grinding has really slowed down. The wand from BFD was 29 dps (got at lvl 24), i'm 37 and the best wand i could get was from a long quest chain from 1k needles, and it only does like 32.9 dps.
---
def head to desolace for the sm quest "in the name of the light."
---
What exactly "flagged for pvp" do? Other than changing your name color
---
I'm Bigglesworth Horde also, could you DM name?
---
I agree, only thing I'm unaware of is it may be more challenging to implement questing and story (that many people enjoy) without at least increasing the level range some. Maybe they do it in smaller portions of 5 instead of 10 and lower the rate of exp that quests give, idk.

doesn't work in classic
---
Nope, except you choose horde for the 2.
---
These are sensational. Thank you for posting.
---
The place? Plymouth here
---
No one is making you AOE grind. It might be faster, but if you enjoy the journey of leveling, absolutely go with a single target build.
---
I give random People healthstones. You never know when you gonna need that small healthboost to kill a mob or just escape without dieing.
---
I noticed something similar when I was looking at mat prices earlier in the week, unfortunately I got sidetracked  questing with friends before I could start powerleveling. I’ll have to see if that holds up when I log on tonight. 
---
Doesn’t solve my mining problem, but as the only BS among my friends they’ve given me a good number of recipes that are taking up bank space that I’m not quite high enough level for, so it’s good to know that I should be able to consistently level up for a while.
---
Warcraft III actually goes into detail on this, in case you're interested in actually playing through it. Barring that, you can play through Stratholme in Caverns of Time on retail and get a good idea, too. [Wowwiki has a good write-up for the details, too,](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil) though you have to read through both Arthas' and Sylvanas' entries.
---
Arthas was the Prince of Lordaeron when Mal'Ganis brought the plague to Stratholme via the food supply line. Against Uther's wishes, he resorted to a total purge of Stratholme, but they couldn't stop the plague and the city was lost (see also: Stratholme in Plaguelands). This was also the beginning of Arthas' downfall and the start of the scourge.
---
Long story short, the scourge plague eventually swept over Lordaeron, killing its inhabitants and turning them into mindless undead with no free will, Arthas chased Mal'Ganis down to Icecrown, trading his original hammer, Light's Vengeance for Frostmourne, which started corrupting him with the voice from the Lich King. He killed Mal'Ganis, but was thoroughly corrupted by that point and was a death knight for the Lich King, and shortly after returning home killed his father. (Note: Arthas is _not_ the Lich King at this point. He's basically a Death Knight general for Ner'zhul, who is the actual Lich King.) This is the start of the Third War. Arthas has necromantic power now and is able to raise up a number of undead for his own will (this is how he gets Invincible), though it's still ultimately the Lich King's power.
---
After Lordaeron fell, he moved on to Quel'Thalas and Silvermoon, where Sylvanas and the other rangers (among which were Nathanos, the only human ranger, and Lor'themar Theron, in case you're wondering about those connections) fought against him. They, too, ultimately lost. Sylvanas was raised up as a banshee, enslaved to the Lich King. Nathanos was also technically a dark ranger, but his body was badly decayed (he can be found in a hut in Plaguelands and is a quest giver in Classic). Lor'themar escapes death/undeath, but the Sunwell is corrupted when Arthas uses it to make Kel'Thuzad a lich, cutting the high/blood elves off from its magic. Sylvanas and the Dreadlords are sent to occupy Lordaeron and hold it for the Lich King. At some point, she regains her body, making her the first dark ranger.
---
Shortly after, the Lich King's power is waning and has dwindled to the point that Sylvanas is able to regain her free will, as were some of the other banshees. They and the dreadlords mutiny against Arthas.
---
Around this time, she realizes she no longer has her nature powers, but she still has magic, allowing her to perform necromancy. Her alliance with the dreadlords was tenuous, so she felt the need to acquire an army. She and her banshees possessed a bunch of people from different inhabitants in the area and attacked the dreadlords. Varimathras defected and became her servant, killing the other two dreadlords. 
---
It's unclear just how she was able to free the will of other undead, but if you read through the text of the initial quests for an undead character, it's evident that the process is hit or miss -- you either gain freedom or you become a mindless undead and are put down for good.
---
If I recall correctly, Agility should increase your Attack Power by 2 per every point of Agility. It also increases your critical strike chance, I think (but I'm not sure, that might just be with ranged weapons). Strength will increase your attack power by 1 per point of Strength, so it's *beneficial*, but not as beneficial as Agility.
---
What you'll need to figure out by mousing over your Attack Power stat in your character screen is how much it increases your damage. I'm not sure how everything scales, but I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/casw61/how_much_attack_power_is_1_weapon_damage/) with some AP -&gt; Damage breakdowns in the comments.
---
call me a noob and everything, but i discovered a place called Cutthroat alley in Sw recently. I never noticed it until recently.
---
You sound like a phone screenshotting dummy
---
Poe player?
---
If you have a group that can run them quickly dungeon grinding is the most efficient method for leveling.
---
Meanwhile blizzard still only has two specs for demon hunter. Like your work, all of them seem very interesting
---
Reduce the servers sizes. Que times are reduced to like 1 hour. The bulk of the people will just wait that. I only whish they hadnt open so many new servers. Just splits the player base, this is not retail . No crossrealm stuff
---
Uhh... what alternative do you suggest? Just sit there and die? You can go for CC if it's up but after that you kind of have to heal yourself.
---
I'd probably stop around 40 when I have my mount/when I out level SM
---
Fun? Friends? What are those? I'm hardcore and that's all that exists
---
Do you like my impression of you? It's super precise
---
This would be written as follows. 
---
#showtooltip Shield Bash  
---
/equip "1h name here"  
---
/equip "shield name here"  
---
/cast Shield Bash  
---
This is a 2 button macro. It will keep you in your current stance, on first press equip your sword and shield triggering a global cooldown, and second press would bash. It is good for pve against mobs mainly because it telegraphs exactly what you are doing if an enemy caster is smart. They will juke cast. Once you get pummel you'll mostly be in berserker stance when fighting casters so just use that from 44 or whatever you get the skill.
---
I mean, the biggest one is Esfand if you want to bring up twitch streamers. He is clearly playing ret.
---
I just bought the big atlas off eBay for $25.  It’s pretty cool
---
not even onyxia PepeLaugh
---
I do that! Or just join in the fight if someone needs it. I still feel helpless though, I got so used to being able to heal people.
---
1. Nobody uses that letter in school. Open Websters dictionary and you won't see those spellings. Congratulations on knowing archaic English spellings.
---
2. Could've and Could of sound the same. This point is irrelevant.
---
3. You aren't a native speaker. You not understanding OP is because your grasp of English is weaker. "Could of" corresponds to how people use the language, your example is how people who do not grasp the language like a native speaker use it. Just because you learned what cat lady English teachers write in style guides doesn't mean you grasp how native speakers use the language 100%. As another poster has said English speakers have been saying "could of" for at least 200 years. Merrian Websters even has an Auxiliary verb definition of "of". [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/of](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/of)
---
The change may have started as a mistake but it has now been absorbed as part of the language just like every single feature of every single language in the world.
---
That's just not true at all lol. I can brew Anti-venom to drop your poison DoT and Vanish drops Hunter's Mark.....
---
You are just playing against bad players
---
I don't mind the gank .... Mostly was expecting it, and was surprised I could quest for about an hour or so before it happened. Just the fact that he says go retail .... What's the point?
---
I love doing this personally.
---
52 Rogue here.
---
My biggest tip is to go (reasonably) out of your way to get weapon upgrades wherever you can. Below is a link of a main hand progression list for weapons that can be obtained without relying on BoE RNG.
---
https://shadowpanther.net/mainhand.htm
---
paladins can already do everything tho
---
tarren mill is in hillsbrad, just get killed in it and youll spawn there. saves a ton of traveling
---
Slippery slope.
---
Honestly I love gifting people stuff as a thank you. I don't really give tips, but I give them bracer enchants or bags and almost everyone is glad to get them.
---
This is probably the closest you'll get to Logan that I can think of

I *think* they have already replaced them in the versions that are digitally downloadable from Blizzard's site if you have already the games in your account. And the new voices are the ones that you are used to hearing since WotLK at least - so there will be minor disruption only for us few souls who actually hold on to their physical media in the first place :P
---
That failed grunt will be back to farming wood for the Horde in a matter of seconds.
---
I must live in a bubble because I’ve only really ever played rogues, but my classic rogue feels like shit compared to retail. It’s slow, not complex at all, and it just feels better in retail.  
---
Stagnant energy regen is probably the culprit, but I just don’t see the “complex” class design I keep hearing about.
---
lol like there werent people like this on vanilla and privat servers assholes and loot cobolds are everywhere
---
I see where you are coming from, i do.  
---
Of course there needs to be common sense in what you roll on, i do not roll need on everything that i need, because i look forward, and i see what else i can get and what is the biggest upgrade..  
---
However i just feel like it has to be said, that its stupid giving hunters shit, for taking ''Your'' drop, if it was ur dropped you should've reserved it, or won it.. too bad..  
---
I am a strong believer of discussing Rolling after items drop, that meaning, fx if we kill a boss, 2 items drop..  
---
Then after that we can go through, okay how big of an upgrade is this for you etc.  
---
But, i also feel, that i as a hunter, am not allowed to roll on something, because a mage only thinks its an upgrade for them, even though it can be a bigger upgrade for me..  
---
We all just need some commen sense, and talk.. that is what classic is about after all
---
Rerolling my rogue because I just can’t find a dungeon group. Spending my nights with a 2hr search isn’t fun at all.
---
I am Horde, if I was alliance I wouldn't have even bothered with the ww axe grind, and just gotten bonebiter tbh.
---
No matter the leveling process of which you go, eventually you will end up on the same questing "path" as the other character.  There's a more in depth explanation on this you can problably find by watching YouTube videos on leveling.  
---
TL:DR. Start a night elf hunter eventually end up in Tanaris, start a human pally (great choice imo) eventually end up in Tanaris.
---
I was elated when I got the 14-slotter from the Discs of Norgannon.
---
This 100% you won’t start seeing anything that even remotely resembles a challenge until c’thun. 
---
My guild in Vanilla even killed twin emps on our first raid night on them, because of 1.12 talents etc.
---
Yeah, my wording is poor. Unfortunately, I'm amateur at best at writing long posts like this. What starts the chain is the random attacking of people who are already fighting a mob. It isn't another player - it's just a generic quest enemy they need to complete the same quests you do, essentially. The "chain" is people complaining about the other faction having no honor. Then they do it to someone else.
---
There are cockroach pets you can buy in Undercity.  I think they are about 1.5g, so not exactly cheap.  I'd rather have the 1.5g to be honest.  If you want something practical, a really good wand would be nice (just make sure it's better than Greater Magic Wand).
---
Is flair specific to reddit premium? I forgot that was even a thing
---
If vanish is off cooldown. 5 minutes is a long time.
---
I had a lvl?? troll mage help me out with a gnoll grind in the wetlands last night. When I first saw him charging his frostbolt in my direction, I vanished - but then I realised he went after the mobs. He spent at least 5 minutes helping me kill mobs (letting me tag them first) before he went on his way!
---
Not all hordes on ZT are bad - but I'm sure I'll have a different point of view when I hit STV...
---
Well i guess if your talking about an item worth 5-10g if some needs it, let them need and the rest greed. But lets say Edgemasters Handguard drops, yeah the warrior will most likely put it too use, but is it fair that he is the only one who gets a chance at 2500-3000gold? Because thats what they are gonna sell for on the auction house. He saves that gold by equipping, but the rest of the group is loosing out on the chance to roll for 3000gold.
---
You didn’t really screw up. Engineering is meta, you just put that work in on the front end. 100g will come pretty quick once you start doing quests in your 40’s.
---
I use one I made using the tool that says "no worry no bad" before casting it.
---
the true lpt is in the comments
---
No sure why people want the MM in MMO?
---
Bitter you didnt use my picture :(
---
Same. I also don't pvp warriors since I know how hard it is to level the class.
---
Yeah I just got that. Thanks!

Not to mention MC is LFR level of difficulty. We shall see how it goes as BWL, ZG, and AQ get released.

Also, AV.

Have you?

Nah man it's the *principle*
---
yeha for the mob rotation i was also wondering, what would be the best.
---
sinister strike 2x &gt; slice and dice &gt; sinister strike &gt; eviscerate
---
I'm totally in the no-changes camp.
---
That being said - why is rogue even able to roll need on wands?
---
Okay but wouldn't it be kinda epic if at some "end point"/main point in the zone, since blizzard clearly doesn't want people in there anyway if they crafted some really epic elite mob, no loot no exp or anything should you get enough people to kill it. But instead of them tossing ban hammers to people getting into places they clearly weren't intended to, to wistfully explore and suddenly face a death Lord?
---
You must be new here
---
I don't see why people use Trade Chat over the LFG Channel. Trade is limited to cities; LFG is limited to only the faction of that server.
---
I guess if you want fewer options, then sure, go for 'LFG-ing' in Trade.  (ツ)
---
Shaman says hi
---
Then the guy who can use it sells it on AH anyway. Always.
---
Well, there's a big gate in the way, and afaik the green raid portal never worked.
---
There's one in UBRS behind Rend that's supposed to go to BWL, I think I even used it once (but you get attuned so you can use the orb, far far easier).  And everyone knows about the one in BRD which used to be the only way into MC.

There's a lot to love about classic, but the fact is most raids are pretty easy by todays standards. People have had 15 years to get better at this game, so of course going back and playing raids from 15 years ago are going to be easy by todays standards.
---
I'm still looking forward to it though :)
---
We've been ultra squishy since they nerfed our self heals into the ground..hell even in wrath without wolves we COULD be squishy..took a bit to get rid of that sadly.

They just overnerf us too much as far as survivability goes
---
Have I what?
---
Seriously. All i see in chat is LF2M DPS for instances. I don't remember it like that.

Well if this is your first go around then I don’t want to spoil it for you. Strat undead/live are very special experiences in Vanilla WoW.
---
This subreddit is just an echo chamber, not just about hunters but many others things as well.

On the sidebar there is a link to add flair.

So how do i say UwU
---
I play as an Undead Warlock, and am currently questing through Ashenvale. Most of the time I'm very docile, but when I'm about to be ganked I often just sacrifice my Voidwalker and then fear my attacker. I also have a macro for laughing when I use healthstone, to throw off anybody who thinks their gonna stop me from questing. 
---
But if we're the same level and you attack first, lord have mercy, for I will fear and "/lol" you into oblivion. I don't care if I die.
---
10/10 post OP. would read again.

I have never played PoE or GW2

Oh I watched my fair share or people dying, but they were assholes. Questing in Arathi trying to get these fucking raptor hearts, as a 38 rogue is was not really hard. So you know the drill, few spawns, drop rate sucks everyone is fighting for their mobs but everyone is playing "fair" this time. 
---
They see you going towards a mob just turn around and go on their merry way. But not this freaking druid 31... the mobs are 36-37 what the hell is he doing around there... ??? That little rat was moon firing on mobs just before people were attacking them then letting high level kill the mobs just grab the quest reward and skinning the mob.
---
He did this to me, I was like "what the hell... come on", So the mob agro me wont let go I kill it, the little druid comes loot and skin just bolt off. Well, I don't have to tell you that when I saw him agroing 2 raptor 37, fighting for his life, I stood there eating "/point /laugh" and watched him die.
---
This kind of stuff happened to me A LOT during my leveling, and I was always happy to watch someone die after he pulled some shit on me. Maybe some of them were mad because "I sat and watched", in then end maybe you did something to someone at some point and they have a long memory.
---
I got my KoS list for alliance, but I got a few horde on my "Do not fucking help" list also.

Methinks this one protests too much

don't they have 4 specs?

Nope. Not unless you aggressively spam dungeons and grind mobs. I'm leveling mostly through quests, lvl56, and have visited almost every zone except the early horde zones, since I'm alliance. And still, I find myself grinding mobs and running dungeons to grab some extra XP.
---
So he can then laugh at posts like this
---
Ahh, thank you, I was using Renew quite a bit for some reason and now I see I shouldn't have been. I'll knock that off and see if that helps. Thanks again!
---
I think a TON of people who leave Classic would come back if they released new content.
---
&gt;Man you're truly a razer hater. 
---
I have a Razer Chroma keyboard with the hybrid caps, it's great. The mice suck, the QA on the switches is abysmal, and as a result the mice are prone to failure.
---
Jax?
---
are sword &gt; dagger?
---
i always run around with daggers &lt;.&lt;
---
How viable is it to hop on a 60 and powerlevel a friend? I remember this being a thing to a degree, but it's hard to Google for.
---
If so, any ideas on best dungeons and class to do it on? I'm working on an alt when I cant play with my duo buddy.
---
As did i.. tired of the nightly queue
---
Shadow Priests are the 1v1 kings.
---
nvm, not that
---
Press 'U' in-game.
---
I buff probably 75% of the randoms I seeing running around. If I don't it's because I have to pop out of animal form, buff, then pop back in which is both time consuming and costs a lot of mana.
---
You apparently cant read, must be a warrior. I said EVERYONE should roll. No where did I say to ninja anything. You simply say, "hey, this is valuable, I think we should all roll." If a skull flame shield or a kroll blade drops, you better believe everyone in my group is rolling for it. That's 450 gold. Same thing with an assassins blade at low levels. I'm not passing a 250g weapon to someone's stupid alt that's going to sit in character select for weeks at a time. 
---
If people wanna ninja, feel free to join my blacklist. I doubt your altruism is going to extend to complete strangers in azeroth. Well... maybe it will for reddit karma's sake....
---
I play on 4 servers. Herod and Whitemane are my Horde/Alliance.
---
All of them have the same issues with people complaining - then also doing the behavior right afterwards.
---
You get the tusks while doing the trolls ears quest in STV.
---
Then depending on level, spend 20-30 minutes grinding Elementals for the crests.
---
I’d say whichever option has the best cumulative stats
---
As a fellow 30-something dad and a "just a healer" smite-spec priest ... I'm just going to /bow to you and hope you don't melt my poor Hordie face off.
---
You can either use and addon called 'AdvancedInterfaceOptions' or use the console command: /console floatingCombatTextCombatHealing 1
---
Setting the console command to '0' turns it off.
---
Cheap shot and immediately gouge after. You can can gouge their blink.
---
I tried questing solo for about 2 hours in North STV last night on your realm, skeram alliance. Horde outnumbered about 10-1 in all the popular quest spots but there were still enough alliance that they were deterred from attacking because they knew it would start a war.
---
Until some try hard undead mage killed me a couple times I called my rogue friend and started an absolute slaughter. We easily killed over 100-200 horde in an hour or two while only dying 5 times or so. 
---
-37 priest with 37 rogue friend.
---
Have to group up and kill on sight. Horde only win in large packs, those dogs.
---
there is an addon I use, player notes or something, keeps track of all friendly players. Add a note to them and whenever their name shows up in chat, it displays a note tooltip with your note. If we ever end up in the same group, i'm sure as hell to expose ninja looters.
---
Yikes
---
Stats.
---
Check the stats.
---
If staff gives you more stats, use staff. If 1h + oh gives you more stats, use 1h + oh.
---
As a very general rule of thumb, staff = more raw stats (int/stamina/spirit) while 1h + oh = more spell/healing power.
---
Please use it! You can grind big gold at 60 but using that high quality of staff this early and at your level is only going to happen once. In the end you'll still be making money off of it, selling every other weapon you come across
---
Yeah ninjaing that chest is a great way to never get invited to raid
---
Depends on the wep stats. The weapon means nothing but stats for you. What you should look into is wands. Those will help your DPS a ton and you won’t go Kim after every pull!
---
Nah they intentionally made it ranged..
---
I do wish they'd do a rune fencer/magic knight thought that swals it with melee abilities charging a kinda mana bar to unleash powerful spells in combat.
---
Nice. I love how macros take Druids from clunky to buttery smooth playstyles just with a few macros.
---
10 times lol. I surpassed that my first 15 minutes in STV.
---
I play with friends.  Our raid will have one shadowpriest.  We aren't "hardcore".
---
Just because we arent dumb enough to fill our raid with non viable players doesn't make us hardcore
---
Someone's gonna get their ass whipped!
---
They're just trying to bother you
---
Literal. Fucking. Goosebumps.
---
As a rogue I make sure I only attack when my target is already engaged with a mob, not only does it ensure victory, if the mob gets the KB I get to do inventory dmg to them also and make them repair.
---
Welcome to stvietnam.
---
I usually roll toons on both sides as the early zones for each are different.
---
Overall, I've had more positive experiences with Horde. Despite being the so called 'monstrous races', they're usually more mature people.
---
In the current case, looks like I'll be playing almost entirely Horde again as I found a really solid and communicative guild and it sucks playing Alliance without them.
---
As a priest I Rez all corpses I find. About 90% of the time the player is there and accepts the Rez so then it’s heal and buff time. Often this turns into a group where we quest together and help each other
---
\#nOChAngEs
---
fastest kills on pservers were around 45- 50 seconds, but we don't know how close those servers were to the vanilla boss stats.
---
Should, but it’s a smaller percentage change to your max health so less reliable.
---
"You must be new here."
---
"You must be fun at parties."
---
and
---
"Who hurt you?"
---
are quite possibly the most basic, robotic responses possible from another human, yet Reddit is full of those responses.
---
FYI. Similar joke was already posted a few days ago.
---
Yeah didn't realize there were server discs set up
---
Yea getting ganked is no fun ):
---
Any decent rogue isnt going to gank you with no vanish. If you’re the one doing the ganking thats a different story.
---
Duel my druid eZ win
---
I just got another rank of it so I can only buff like 3 people and my mana pool is drained :(. That said, 20 stamina is substantial at my level.
---
I'd say it's not the only class that can do it, but it is the most optimized for ranged DPS in classic raids.
---

but that's fully manual isn't it? if you take the time to do that one by one I don't mind..but having bots do it makes me so mad lol
---
For endgame, what professions are best for resto druid?
---
I may completely wrong but I think there's an exp penalty applied for when the party has higher level characters. This would only be viable to help a friend get quests completed if that's the case. Or to gold grind for a mount.
---
Did a 4-paladin, 1-priest group for SM back in the day, it was great fun. I'd love to do an all-paladin leveling group some time.
---
I dont like unrelated shit in this amazing sub. Especially not some religious crap.
---
Bruh no one has ever tipped me for water you are a saint.
---
You're thinking is pretty 1 dimensional. Yeah if all you want to do is stab things go rogue. Personally I like being able to save a group by giving out a clutch heal, or off tanking that patrolling mob that nobody saw, or combat rezzing the healer etcetc.
---
When i eventually level my tailoring high enough to craft these, i plan on holding a lottery for a full set in a starting zone.
---
1s to enter. I'll have people roll in groups. Highest roll in each group will move on until only 2 remain. then they have to duel.
---
Its super effective!
---
"wow I get killed by other players in pvp servers"
---
The Horde and Alliance are at war. There is no honor in war.
---
My favorite part of rolling a shaman has been finding dead people in the middle of a zone and rezzing them
---
include addon list?!
---
When your about to kill one wait until they sit down to eat and use ambush..if they are sitting its 100% crit chance
---
He's complaining about his faction allies not helping him.  He's complaining about not enough pvp
---
As a warlock I’d like to introduce you to being dotted and feared while you stare into my succubus’ eyes!
---
To be fair, there's not exactly much to learn as far as how to play it
---
In Rift they added a melee mage with the first expansion. It was really really fun and I loved it.
---
I got the 1h epic off of Eranikus in Sunken Temple. The one that spawns the green whelp. I tanked with that sword until I got Bloodlord's Defender when ZG finally released.
---
How did you pull this off? How did you earn enough money to buy the materials needed to craft things?
---
It's "/join World" not "/6"
---
Well yeah just saying a good rogue won't try to gank a hunter of similar level without Vanish. Hunters are one of the best counters for rogues so yeah a bad rogue will get stomped by the average hunter most times
---
Fair! Someone made a really good argument (in my pee brain) that leveling as prot was nice since you could deal with more level-appropriate mobs and establish an identity as a tank on the server early on, but what you say makes sense too. :P
---
I'm the type of person that overthinks class selection so badly that I get frustrated and quit games haha. Always nice to have pretty unified opinions on things and it seems like "go Arms/Fury to level" is the consensus.
---
I wonder if anyone has done a class/role survey for classic yet, speaking of all this.
---
Guidelime. You have to download it and a guide and put them both in the addon folder. Sometimes the guides are a little off too but it’s been pretty helpful for me so far to get quests I would have missed otherwise
---
Nah you should just stop being a humourless twat.

Overwatch Sigma is leaking!
---
That's rich coming from the side that so far is only initiating fights with horde where they have a 2-1 or even 3-1 advantage. Don't play PvP servers if you don't like it.
---
both paid and free version?
---
10 stam at 43.....oof. Am I the bad guy that says I'd just rather you wear a level relevant helm?
---
The pirates are mid-40s so it'll probably still be a bit before you can start it, unless you're crafty and follow someone around who's clearing the ships for the Booty Bay quest.
---
Their mobility is off the charts?  Bruh they have blink that's it lol
---
Ok, noted. And this doesn't give any errors or anything running both at the same time?
---
As far as scans, so far in classic I am just using the like "one time get all scan" or whatever. The scan on the far right with two &gt;&gt;. Is this wrong?
---
looks like a Curse Of Monkey Island screenshot
---
I didn't feel squishy until I came back in legion, in BC and warth I felt powerful enough to go toe to toe with any class that I had equal gear, although RNGesus could fuck you in wrath by not giving maelstrom wep procs, the biggest issues with shaman in retail imo is we have no mobility in a high mobility game and we have almost no CC in a high CC game.
---
At work will let you know once I’m home if no one has replied by then
---
Yeah I’m starting to get tired of barrens but I’ll be in my way to ashenvale or thousand needles later today so that’s cool. I’ve never played alliance extensively but I do really like the nelf starting area. Danassus is definitely cool but yeah I don’t see anyone hanging out there. I didn’t know there was an alliance train. Anyway thanks for the detailed response
---
Okay cool thank you!
---
#nochanges
---
People forget that /ingnore is also a blacklist.
---
You keep that up, and suddenly you have no one inviting you to partiez.
---
Just a tip there greedy rogues.
---
If I want to occasionally be a healer for me and my friends for some dungeons is it necessary to spec into healing throughout all of leveling?
---
I’m rolling a shaman and would prefer not to grind quests as slow as possible but would I not be a good enough healer otherwise?
---
Damnit I was gonna do that
---
I would be willing to argue that characters like Alleria, Sylvanus, and Hemet Nesingwary are different types of hunters. The first two were Ranger Generals, iirc, while Hemet is a little hard to pin down. 
---
Also, it isn’t only Rexxar. Nathanos has a bunch of puppies.
---
I wish I had enough disposable income to commission some stuff from you, in particular some alliance counterparts to this series, like the dead guard in eastern elwynn, hogger, the deadmines, or the ambush in Redridge Mountains.
---
god knows why but from a distance I thought the BOE message said birds when shipped which made me think there was some swarm of parrots to aid you whenever you went on a ship
---
strange we seem to be playing a different game, I ended up in world of warriorcraft
---
*source: I am a warrior too...*
---
No you cant , but should an engeneer and blacksmith spend money and resources to open locked chest for you for free? If you want to roll for locked chests , you better be rolling and giving away stuff you mine/skin and herb. Lockpicking is a skill just like mining and herb. You are not entitled to the loot from locked chest
---
Loch modan / Redridge / Duskwood
---
appreciate the feedback!
---
SOUNDS LIKE USING IT TO ME
---
Awesome! thanks for the info.
---
They’re not offering transfers off sulfuras lmfao
---
paging scrubquotes
---
Yeah I’m almost 40 and close to my mount.  I have friends on this server as well but we won’t mind transferring sometime in the future, as long as it is available
---
Popping in and out of cat form will end up costing more Mana than it's worth
---
Gold spamming sites was an integral part of the vanilla experience. I agree #nochanges if you don't like it just block channel requests. Took longer to write this post complaining about it rather than using a solution built in game for you.
---
And do what with the thick leather?
---
People complaining about how easy the raids are and I'm still trying to get out of the Barrens.
---
thanks! I'll do that then
---
You can still easily heal BRD as Shadow. I respecced to Disc to try it out and the gains were marginal in terms of group healing, but it sucked so bad for soloing.
---
But then you won't receive proper invites. The problem is there's no other way to report players doing this. If they're not in your area you can't target them and there's no /report &lt;character name&gt; function either.
---
"Open the damn chest or we're kicking you and inviting that hunter."
---
Thank you for your buffs and healing (:
---
I play on a pvp server, and I had a lot of left over quest to finish in Arathi last night (I turned 41). I went back to do some ogre quest in a cave, and the pirate quests. I saw a bunch of level 30-35 Alliance, I would say that I would never go and ganked and attack a low level 5 level under me, unless they attack me first I even helped a 30 mage that agroed some level 37 bird. The poor dude just stood still while I backstab the bird, then ran away again agroing another bird. Killed the first, killed the second he stood still in a corner and logged off lol.
---
I will go and help Horde players or lowbies that ask in general for help if I happen to be in the zone and they have trouble. I was grinding leather in shimmering flats at 40 at the turtle spots, I was killing these level 30-35 turtle waaayyy faster than the level 30 horde around me thus I was "eating away" a lot of the spawn.
---
Some dude complained to me that I was there and killing HIS mobs for HIS quest, I told him "Look around you and spot where are the alliance", they were AT LEAST 10 yrds out trying to get the turtle for their quests, there was 2 rogues, 1 warrior, 1 warlock and a druid. I told the guy "Take my presence as a deterrent and the way you're paying my service is allowing me to grind a bit here". 
---
Might sounds a bit douchey but the reality was the were not getting close to the spot because that 40 rogue was grinding there. So yeah some people are just hmmm clueless. 
---
I revenge, I was waiting for a mob spawn near ratchet in northwatch hold for a quest with a friend. We were there for a solid 10 minutes alone waiting for the respawn. This horde rogue walks up with two other dudes and say;
---
"Soo I guesss...."
---
"This is our spawn"
---
"And you guys can fuck off"
---
I told him "Soooo I guess you could invite us"
---
The other horde were laughing. I never spammed tab and attack so hard in my life. Got the tap on the mob, killed him and walked off told the guy;
---
"Sooo I guess... it was our spawn after all".
---
This PoS made my horde list ;)
---
Free food and Mana, fill yer banks up.
---
There's a quick scan feature with Auctioneer. When you click it, it'll pop a dialog box saying it is intensive and can crash your game (only happened 3 times to me so far). It takes probably 10 seconds to scan everything using that feature.
---
I'll attack any alliance member that is not a skull. It's only smart to "live to fight another day" instead of maybe getting a string of resists and blowing all cooldowns to shave off like 2% of a skull. That being said, when I'm max level expect plenty of quest disruption and infernals being delivered to goldshire/lakeshire...
---
And if you do find a chest, PLEASE LOOT EVERYTHING so it can respawn
---
This dude's got a sad life? You're going comment to comment telling spewing to everyone how you think it's fake. If it's fake or not who cares ? 
---
You've got a sad life dude
---
I use the paid version for both Retail and Classic. It's only 8$ per month.. Worth it for me :)
---
Haven’t. Think that could be a fix?  Someone told me it’s due to a lack of graphic/ video card in the MacBook. But I’m not sure.
---
I'm a warrior and I really appreciate every single buff I receive from y'all
---
I had justification OP it wasn't nothing like a BiS but I got cookies wand and the warrior and rogue in my group need rolled. I immediately left the group since I'm the healer and they still needed to do the final boss lmao f those guys.
---
Yes, easily. I played on a really old laptop when my pc power supply blew and the game still ran super smooth and looked shockingly good.
---
Nope. Shapeshifting costs too much mana. You will burn through your mana in no time. Like 3 shapeshifts and you're done.
---
Hi, /u/TxJoker88

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2rj72/psa_dont_forget_to_put_your_upgraded_skills_on/). 
---
Even back then dial up was no longer the standard. Just because you had stingy parents doesn't mean most people did.
---
The biggest problem from what I hear is the preparation it required each night. You needed to spend a lot of gold on repairs, potions, flasks, etc each night. If you raided 3 nights a week that is a lot of gold you needed. In the days before daily quests you had to farm hard pretty much all the time. For most people they just don't want to dedicate that much time to the game or they want to level alts, do pvp, etc in their non raid time. Also with the warrior tank requirement that really guts a lot of 2nd tier guilds that are working on AQ 40 since they could instantly get a raid spot in the top guilds on the server. So guilds that were doing decently in AQ40 progression would be gutted of core raid members.
---
This is really cool, but I can't help but feel like the Mysticism would somehow fit Shamans more. Also, Priest already rock two healing specs, so a fourth for them would make sense to be damage. I know it's just concept, but it would leave room for a priest damage spec which I think could be cool.
---
I didn't know I wanted this.
---
Nah man just heal. If you need to heal so little wrath things.
---
&gt; You aren't even consistent ... 
---
Archaic means it is so old it has fallen out of use, my example cites something as being in use for a long time. Entirely consistent.
---
&gt; I'll ask you to have the courtesy to not assume what you don't know, first of all. 
---
I will assume that if you are unfamiliar with "could of" and have to pause and think about it you were taught English formally and not by passive absorption. 
---
&gt;but not to the vast majority of English-speaking people I've met in my life.
---
Have you asked them? Seems like a really weird thing to bring up in conversation.
---
&gt; It hasn't, and is still a mistake, yet people ITT try to justify it by all means. 
---
Would my grade school have English teacher put a red check mark on my paper for typing "would of"? Yes. Would any American/UK english speaker be confused reading an informal use of "would of"? No.
---
Are changes to languages required to be smart? No, it is just how we talk. Words becoming slurred and unintuitive turns of phrase are present in every language, to say informal speech isn't part of the language is ignorant though. For someone typing a Reddit post giving someone shit for saying "Would of" is just petty, because the only people who won't understand are people who learned English from books. OP could have said woulda, coulda, or shoulda and I still would have understood what he is saying, and that he wished to have an informal candor in his writing style, like how people type out "Y'all".
---
I use that too but I read it doesn’t grab everything because of the fast scan but it does grab most items. You could even use TSM while using auctioneer and Auctionator.  All the tabs are at the bottom
---
Makes sense, thank you!
---
Loch Modan has some quests in the SE area your level.

You can also quest in stonetalon or redridge!

Pets can be a little tricky in Classic. You need to be teaching it new ranks of abilities every so often, some of those like Growl can be learned from the pet trainer while others come from taming other pets.
---
Fortunately, you can learn up-to-date ranks of both Bite and Claw in Hillsbrad Foothills. 
---
First off, put your cat in the stable. Then find a lvl 20 or 21 "Forest Moss Creeper" and tame it. There are a bunch near Tarren Mill. Once it's tamed, attack some stuff with it while using it's Bite ability until you see a yellow chat message saying you've learned the Bite ability.
---
After you see the chat message, abandon your spider.
---
Then find a lvl 21 or 22 "Gray Bear" in the same area, tame it and repeat the process of using it's Claw ability until you see the yellow chat message, and abandon it.
---
The levels and names of those pets you tamed are important, as different pets have different abilities, or none.
---
Then get your cat out of the stable and use your Beast Training skill, and you'll be able to teach it the Bite and Claw abilities.
---
For some more info and a list of where/when to learn new abilities, have a look through this site - https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php
---
I'm very happy that I now have vanish. If I see someone trying to ninja something I'm near and I'm busy fighting. I'll just let them have the mobs instead.
---
Sure, but in that case it's at least buying me 5 minutes of peace without really expending any of my own resources. And that's just hunter's mark, hunters are basically purpose-built for fucking up rogues. Better stealth detection, traps, mail armor, 8% extra dodge, and a pet that can fuck them up even while you're stunned.
---
Hunters are a different breed
---
The higher level I get (into the 50’s now) on my rogue the happier I am that I’m a rogue lol, yeah it has it’s rough times, but every class will have a rough time leveling at some point - I think the push for spell cleave aoe dungeon grinding is getting a lot of rogues down. At least from my experience with all my former rogue friends rerolling in the 30/40’s to play a mage or a warrior. Oh well, more shadowcraft for me.
---
i would of much rathered losing the roll then losing a draw but yeah thats rough
---
I mean, you can continue to repeat that "pvp is fine, ganking is fine" like you have been in this post, but your core message still says "pvp is fine when I want it." 
---
I don't see how it matters if both sides are complaining.
---
not yet.
---
+1
---
That's crazy people already have that considering the game has only been out 2 weeks.
---
LOL feelsbadman
---
Idk man, each class feels like a reskinned whack-a-mole when I've played (Mage/rogue/lock/warrior). But I think my biggest problem is combat felt like an ARPG, especially in mythic+. Only in clutch situations did I need to sheep/stunlock something, and I only sapped things we ran by. Otherwise it was just aoe'ing waiting for passives to proc.
---
I had a 60 rogue back on the day and I could slap mages all day. As a 47 rogue right now I can only beat a mage if I use every single cool down I have. Trust me being 60 and having somewhat decent gear will be a different story
---
The major difference is rogues have vanish. So if they do get caught they can renter stealth. Druids are screwed if they get caught
---
Woulda
---
Different specialization of HUNTER? Yes. I’m at work at the moment, so I can’t confirm this, but I am willing to bet that the in-game description of Hunter mentions a pet, as well as the original play manuals definition of the Hunter mentions Animal Companionship. Marksman, Survival, Beastmastery, Ranger, Tracker, whatever you want to call a specialization, canonical or not, a pet is a needed part of class theme. Mages can use Arcane, Fire, and Frost Magic. That is their fantasy. Just because there are other varieties of magic doesn’t mean they should be allowed to use them.

Q: Will there be Cross Realm Battlegrounds when those go live?
---
A: Cross-realm battlegrounds were a feature of 1.12 and are important for matchmaking, so you’ll be seeing cross-realm battlegrounds in WoW Classic when Battlegrounds are introduced in Phase 3 of the content roll-out plan.

Love the creativity

Your buffs and heals are appreciated,  thank you man I appreciate you (:
---
it was on the same tick that he pressed need, i am not
---
The issue is word choice
---
Classic WoW isn't difficult or hard by any means. The difference between classic and retail is that classic is tuned towards multiplayer, while retail is tuned towards single player. You're not supposed to be able to solo elite mobs in classic, you're supposed to group up
---
Same logic applies to class complexity. People are loving class uniqueness rather than a complex class. It feels great that I'm a shaman in classic because it doesn't feel like any other class is playing the same way. But my rotation is still really simple, I'm just not pressing as many buttons as my retail outlaw rogue
---
&gt;I go to any spot for aoe farming 
---
&gt;&gt; its all contested by other mages and skull rogue gankers
---
If the spot is contested with other farmers and gankers it's not really a farming spot, is it?
---
Instead of picking the most popular spot and having to fight with every one, pick a shittier spot that no one goes too.
---
Some stereotypes are spread through rumor and hearsay, however this is not one of those, this stereotype sprang up from the actions of hunters everywhere, me talking about that it exists doesn't mean I'm propagating it.
---
Also didn't say I was shunning all hunters, I do try to educate people that I group with when possible, but as OP stated in other comments sometimes you see the red flags with people and it's obvious they arent going to take advice.
---
This gave me chills. nice work.
---
I don't like ganking, I just want to play on the same server as my friends. Please spare my wimpy rogue. 😭

And after all these years I thought it was only alliance who were scum of the Earth like that orc warrior.
---
After going through the effort of blocking like 20 different people trying to send me these invites, I just blocked channel invites. Nobody really uses them in my experience.
---
To be entirely honest, an equivalent level mining node likely is worth more than the average chests loot
---
But...doesn't retail also have World PVP? I'm really not understanding the context of "Go back to retail" after getting ganked.
---
Downranking can be useful at low level to conserve mana when bulk healing throughput isn't necessary. If a Lesser Heal will do the job, then there's no reason to chunk my mana pool with a Heal that costs twice or more mana.
---
But how? They adopt the original joke so well and put some great WoW humour over it. I’ve never seen the porn one though lol, didn’t even know that existed
---
Normally I’d say the ganker was kind of a dick.
---
...But here you are, complaining about getting ganked... so maybe he was right...
---
Isn't PW:S mana inefficient, but threat efficient?  As in, the shield generates half the threat an equivalent heal does.
---
Also, very unlikely to be wasted because of the duration, where as overheals exist.
---
Warriors hate it off the bat, but if you can use it earlyish (without rage starving them) with a renew, you're less likely to pull everything they haven't touched, and can get back outside the 5 second rule.
---
That's fair. In such case, I would roll.
---
If a druid doesn't buff you it's probably because he is in cat/bear and low mana
---
This isn't true in the least and it's what leads to so many pointless gank wars. I've been around multiple horde who wont kill me as I'm regaining mana and HP and I've even shared quest spawn points with them. 
---
Not complaining about PvP. I rolled on a PvP server after all. But this mentality of "well that person would do it to me so I am going to do it to them" leads to a lot of wasted time for both Horde and Alliance at a time when everyone is just trying to level as fast as possible.
---
As a rogue player, I get enough free gold from pickpocketing all the mobs while I wait for the tank to establish threat. Chests are for everyone, locked or not. If I REALLY wanted the chests I could go back in at a higher level and stealth through to those chests, lol.
---
Same here, I’m hooked..
---
I have The Rake too but when i captured him, he just turned into a normal cat? is that normal
---
3.3.5 h holy dk’s We’re the closest balance to this
---
I do the same lol, a quick serpent sting and arcane shot really helps them
---
How to manage threat for DPS has a learning curve, as it essentially doesn’t exist in retail. Thus, the premise of this post.
---
I'm not sure, I don't have enough experience with the other specs while leveling. Currently level 28 as a 0/0/18 Paladin and it's been surprisingly smooth so far. I rarely have mana issues (if I do it's because I pulled too much), but I don't have any issues with pulling one or two mobs; I can pull 3-4 if I pop CDs. Very little downtime. I'm actually extremely happy with how leveling has been for me.  
---
If what you're doing is working I'd stick with it. Switch at 60 when you wanna go full Holy, you'll have plenty of time at 60 to get used to it.
---
Don't forget DOTA did as well too.
---
I just think there's bigger problems out there.
---
Arms for PvP is amazing. I did fury until 40 and swapped to Arms to pick up Mortal Strike.
---
It's perfectly viable to stay fury and grab bloodthirst but I prefer Arms for PvP and Sweeping Strikes allows me the same dungeon AoE spam.
---
Kenny becomes the richest character on the server, but right before he manages to get his money from the AH he dies. The end should just show his mailbox filling up with letters with money from the auction house, his character just sitting there.
---
Have you done the two dalaran quests?  You can do 3-5 intro quests in arathi and grab the flight point.  You can do SM GY.   You can do 1k needles.  You can do RFK.  You can tough it out in shimmering flats.  You can do northern and western STM.  You can do ashenvale.
---
I was doing the quest to gather Wyvern eggs in Thousand Needles and I would literally STAND ON THE FUCKING EGG while fighting the mob guarding it and people would STILL take it from me. Blew me away, must have happened 3 times.
---
Do a lot of servers have their own subreddits?
---
I never played vanilla as a Shaman, but I distinctly remember shamans being a viable 'tank' class while playing (pretty sure we even had them as off tanks in MC.
---
Because I spent 100% of my time as a Hunter in Vanilla I'm branching out this time and rolled a Shaman.
---
The other day I started looking into the tanking roll only to find many ppl consider it a 'joke' and not practical.
---
Now I'm questioning my recollection of vanilla. Where there actually shammy tanks or am I just old with rose tinted glasses?
---
&gt;if all you want to do is stab things go rogue
---
No, if I only wanted to stab things I would go *druid*, because that's all a cat can do. It can't lockpick, or utilize poisons, or pick pockets, manage mobs with stuff like Distract or Sap... A cat only mimics the very basic damage and stealth abilities of a rogue.
---
In the immortal words of Ron Swanson, "Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing."
---
I need to keep this in mind to get freebie 14 slot. Thanks!
---
you sound pretentious and your "nice" attitude isnt fooling anyone.
---
This seems to be the main point right here. OP made a mistake and is in panic mode trying to get people to transfer over.
---
Youd need the ore smelted, so im gonna say probably not.
---
Thatd be my logic behind that, but most people would just laugh at you for asking because theyre jerks ahah, id just ask to buy the ore from the guy who mines it
---
I'm glad you are experiencing this lovely sense of community too (:
---
cross my path mate
---
Level 20 mage first time, what is the point in a mages main and off hand? I only use wands when out of mana.
---
What server is this?
---
Rogues sure, what about keys!?
---
is this the same thing that the stormwind portal is?
---
How do I buy reddit coins to give a gold to this guy?!
---
Don't mess with a Toyota
---
[https://youtu.be/u15HmEMp2Qc]
---
Just goes to show how bad warriors were in vanilla without a healer. Can't move, can't heal, can't reflect, and can't gap close. Warriors NEED those special items with CC removal and engineering to be even relevant in pvp.
---
Well not all, but certainly a huge % of the population says could of and probably only realized that isn't formal speech in late grade school.
---
It was "grey" lower-level players and essential non-combat NPCs
---
It's an educated guess. If you're expecting me to come up with a mathematical formula that captures all of the nuance of leveling, I can't help you with that. You're not likely to find anything more than an educated guess regarding any stat and leveling. 
---
You don't need to swap to a spirit set LOL. You prioritize Strength/Spirit gear, Agi/Spirit gear, or at times Stamina/Spirit gear.
---
Feral charge ghost wolf and the sprint?
---
Hex cap totem?
---
What do you mean no cc and no mobility lol
---
Was Puntable an Hunter? Because it's of course a better upgrade for him if he is...
---
No, that's not what I said at all. BoE items that have value on the AH have equivalent value for everyone. A Freezing Band can be purchased for 500 gold, or it can be sold for 500 gold.
---
If you're vendoring an item it no longer has equivalent value. Ironfoe probably vendors for something like 5 gold, but if it was a BoE purchasable on the AH then you know that it'd be worth a lot more than 5 gold. That's why the "everyone rolls need" rule is only for BoEs and doesn't apply to BoPs.
---
This is pretty simple common sense stuff that shouldn't have to be explained.
---
Give shaman tanks!
---
why do I have to try to convince you?
---
I personally vendor up to heavy, then AH Thick and up. I think you could make a case for AH'ing heavy, but I think the margin is small enough I don't waste my time.
---
Under his dress?
---
Any laptop with a 1650 or 1050 graphics chip should comfortably handle WoW. Should be able to find one for around 600 on a good deal.
---
You could also try an older used model like a GTX 960m. I would avoid going lower than that as it will be significantly slower.
---
What??  I've been playing since Vanilla and this is the first I've heard of whole world chat channels . . .
---
Level 60. Planning to finish it with a raid.
---
What quest? Please tell me I need mount money :(
---
I’m maining a warrior right now. When I’m traveling I’ll always target mobs as I pass them. I may only get 1 or 2 hits in but I’ll sometimes get a stun off or a rend. 
---
If I see you having trouble I’ll hang out, taint the mob, and stay till you’re safe.
---
Even a phone picture will do 😋
---
&gt;How many black people do you know irl?
---
It's not just European server, it's majorly scandinavian. I'm sure both black people who play there will manage somehow.
---
Come to Blaumeux.  It's Alliance heavy.  I can't wait for BG's to be on the side that has the shorter queue for once.
---
sent a pm!
---
Done 25 runs, lost two rolls to mages who both needed for vendor gold because they "need it for mount"
---
Right, doesn’t apply to greens.
---
PW:S is usually a bad spell to use in general, as it's extremely inefficient for its throughput value. The only use it has being put on a tank is when mitigating damage that would otherwise kill them while not having time to cast another heal on them.
---
Lmao that warrior is dogshit.
---
Can your computer at home be locked while this is going down?
---
Haha, I get you old timer. I am one too myself ;)
---
Its situational imo. For pve definitely stats. Pvp vs caster 1hander with spellstone may be more advantageous.
---
Then at a minimum it’s more like + 40 stam since helms at that level typically already have 10 Stam or some other stat that would make up for it
---
Lots of people in a month.
---
I get up in the morning, and I fish for 30 mins before work. I go home for lunch and fish for 20 mins then set my character up in the spot ill be questing/farming. Then when I get home I instantly log in to beat any queue. Smoke for 15 mins then come back and play for 4 to 5 hours until bed. Rinse and repeat until the weekend, where I can play for 13 hours. I need a GF..
---
You’re scum.
---
I bet the Priest and Mage have less than 20% mana too.
---
I think most dps are aware of the threat management, but just don't care. When I shatter a coc two seconds into a pull, I'm fully aware that I'm going to pull threat on any mobs that get crit, but it doesn't matter because they aren't really that threatening. Maybe it's just because I'm playing the mongo op class though and it's different for other classes
---
That was the only mutual alliance/horde coexisting questing I did. Had a quest to kill wyverns and collect some drop where the horde just wanted to walk in and get the eggs. Oh how peaceful that ONE QUEST was.
---
All the content is easy if you know what to do.
---
I think it's mostly because nothing feels pointless or out of reach. That allows you to have personal goals and everything you do feels like a step in the right direction and being very satisfying.
---
Should stance switch before the hamstring on lock/priest
---
28 - About 48hr, probably a little less.
---
Yeah but in all my years of wow this has never been the case
---
Yeah when i heard that trend was continued i knew they hadnt realized their mistake and knew i shouldnt sub back even in like Legion when my friend was telling me talents finally got good again(you seriously missed out not playing with the BC/WotlK talent trees before everything became monolithic).
---
You should totally give classic a try sometime since its free for you, but i wont fault you if you end up liking retail more. Theres just nothing left in retail for me besides raid mechanics. I got sick of queing up from the capitol city after the 2nd raid in MoP(thunder king or whatever), and thats when i originally took my "maybe im done with this" break. I had no idea how important the physical overworld and being forced to travel it was to me until things became so streamlined i didnt go outside the capitols anymore
---
The reason I play a druid is pvp. You actually use all your forms every fight. You can tank warriors in bear form and kite them in caster. You can backstab mages and change when they try to slow. It's one of the most high skill ceiling classes, and the difference between a good and a bad druid is immense
---
it depends on the cloth. For example silk cloth regularly sells for less than 2 silver on my server which is less than the bandages vendor for. Once you take out the AH fees, its a pretty sizable loss.
---
I got this exact invite last night!
---
Ya I play priest too, but I'm leveling as Disc/Holy. My capabilities in pvp aren't great. And I didn't really roll this class for that reason. But I can easily heal dungeons being 5 levels too low, and I choose gear based on aesthetics for leveling, because that's important to me, and it doesn't make or break my capabilities as a healer. I'm a good player, so 1 on 1 situations, I can handle myself. But for the most part, I like to live and let live and don't typically initiate. The nice thing about Disc/Holy is that I'm really difficult to kill - my buffs are better, my shields are thicker and my heals are stronger... my spells are more efficient, and my mana regen is sick. So sure, you can try to kill me, but I'm not going to make it easy and it's pretty much just a waste of both our times.
---
&gt; because the muscle wizard/battle mage archetype has always been one of my favorites
---
Entirely unrelated but I'm excited to try Pathfinder 2.0 just because this actually seems possible in the more modular system.
---
Not selling the recipe means you lose out on the gold you could have made selling it.
---
Opportunity cost is a thing.
---
Yeah, I mainly frequent the Rocket League subreddit.
---
Tbh an undead rogue would definitely gank an injured non undead horde player
---
I love OPs concepts, but I think adding ANY more specs and classes would be disastrous for Classic.
---
The whole homogenization problem arises from the fact that retail has to balance over 30 different "classes". Each spec in retail is so different that it really is a different class from an RPG standpoint.
---
In a game that is a pretty simple "punch stuff till it dies" type of game, there's only so much space for variety before all "ranged dps" feel the same and all "tanks" feel the same.
---
The reason class fantasy is so much more powerful in vanilla than it is in retail, even with retail's meticulously designed classes, is that there's no substitute for you.
---
Even just fleshing out the "same-ish" specs by making them unique would hurt the game. Any hunter should feel like a hunter. Most people will barely be able to tell if their priest is holy or disc or what mix in between. This is good because it reduces the total number of classes in the game.
---
Well you never know of they would ignore you or not if you always attack first.
---
Purely for Stats .
---
Spell Damage , Int, Stam , Etc
---
Enhance is a slot machine.
---
 One shot or lose, that’s how it’s gonna be vs most top tier PvP classes.
---
Good players tend to roll Ele. Crazy high burst, sustained damage, and healing capabilities.
---
I need more stories from 31 year old Shadow Edgedad.
---
49 with 4 days and 10 hrs /played
---
I don't know, that's why I asked. Ironically, that's such a childish response.
---
You're the one who replied to my comment while claiming to be replying to a previous poster.
---
What’s your name...
---
Spontaneous grouping because we're all hunting the same MOBs is awesome. People are working together again... because the game is better that way!
---
what kind of thing you going for? Druid can be good PvP with most specs, and needs different gear for each. Feral BiS for weapon is still without a doubt the manual crowd pummeler though.
---
Don't rank up skills
---
I don't think people realize how much mana it takes to make water, and how useless our water is to us since our mana pool is so high.  Making water for a group, so 3-4 stacks, can be a 5 minute affair.
---
DPS should only attack the Tank's target. Do NOT heal them if they decide to play off-tank.
---
Keep a steady flow of heals to the tank, or, if Tank is above 90% most of the time, use a wand to attack his target to rebuild your mana.
---
If you have a Warlock, HoT on them and their pet will give them more mana to attack with. If you're really OP for the dungeon, full healing the Warlock can speed things up a bunch.
---
You can out generate Threat the Tank is creating real fast by healing others. Note that at melee, if your threat is over 110% of the Tank's threat, you just pulled aggro. If you are at RANGE, then you need 130% of the Tank's threat to pull a mob. So stay back. If you do pull a mob, distance gives tanks time to react, too. Remember: their threat powers have slow cooldowns, they build rage to activate them slowly, and sometimes the power will be resisted (#@%&amp;!!!!!). When things go this far sideways, this is when you bubble yourself, stop doing anything and give the Tank time to pull aggro again.
---
I doubt that’s the case actually but I also didn’t say Europe vs the US, I said Europe was a smaller segment of the overall market.  Most WoW players are from outside Europe, not all are form the US.  Also WoW launched later in Europe by MONTHS in original Vanilla so there was a lot of knowledge already available to European players day one back then that wouldn’t have been available day one to other regions.
---
Retagging
---
There's no battlegrounds also so all twink items are kind of useless
---
I haven't really noticed it. Most of the players I've had bad run ins with have **ALL** been retail players, but they haven't impacted the community as much as I thought so far.
---
Oh look another one of these posts.
---
53 hunter - 7 days ish - spent too much time doing professions and stupid shit haha
---
You can easily do that while waiting / on a Zeppelin or boat lol
---
!remindme 2 months
---
Do macros work for wow classic ?
---
I tried one from kargoz hunter guide and it was blocked
---
Can't Unlogg from the Nogg
---
Which just ignores the problem instead of doing something about it.
---
Nice guide, thanks! I am struggling myself. However how does your pet NOT get feared at tinkerer? My pet gets feared all the time and pulls more xD
---
Where is it? I must be blind because I was looking through the interface for a bit and couldn't find it
---
Literally just hit 15 wth
---
33- 2days 14 hours i think?
---
Well, we're all also 15 years older and hopefully more "adult" than old school vanilla. It's made a difference for sure.
---
I'm a warrior. It's a struggle sometimes. Thanks everyone that buffs, helps with accidental overpulls or even randomly trades something they found while wanting nothing in return.
---
It's nice that besides feeding the nostalgia so many people remember what it was supposed to be all about.
---
Pls god
---
41 Horde Skeram Druid.
---
Have had the exact opposite experience with everyone of your points.
---
That’s what we thought playing Vanilla 😮
---
In gutter speak, undead can say “ss ee oo d a p”
---
Btw just because half of you trashcans are braindead doesnt mean my title or post is misleading. It just means you need to take a break from WoW to prevent from brain from melting. Lmao. Fucking retard.
---
Lol accurate
---
I was mining (iron) my own business when an undead priest walked up to me and started casting. I don't think he knew what to do when he noticed I was immune to fear from berserker rage. Felt great to kill him and continue mining.
---
It’s a joke you joyless ass
---
I join random guilds all the time. If you aren't in a guild you eventually just get random invites. I always join for a few days then quit. Why? Because no one loves me.
---
I need gold, and the general rule if it's a BoE Epic, then everyone rolls need.
---
It's viable, but not optimal.  Reliance on mana and threat generation are your biggest obstacles.
---
You can tank dungeons as a Paladin to complete quests.  For the most part the group can sail through smoothly  pulling 2-3 enemies at a time and focusing down targets.
---
For the more aggressive runs people do like AoE farming it's going to be a lot harder.
---
I wish it was an ability so I didn't have to spend a good 5-7 hours leveling it
---
Could be the retail players trying classic, thinking it's supposed to be just as easy and they don't need to coordinate.   I'm not high enough yet to do dungeons but I know last week, I asked in general if anyone was on a group quest.   No one responded, and about 15-20 seconds a hunter came and tried to solo it.   I sat here and watched as she died.
---
Infernals can be called out of thin air by a warlock anytime. Would it really be okay if any class could just conjure stitches out of midair in goldshire?
---
You think thats a faction thing? Just plain ol' mob mentality my dude.
---
As with any MMO game, experience can wildly vary from player to player.
---
I've noticed that karma is definitely a big factor; negative experiences beget more negative experiences, positive experiences beget more positive experiences. It's a snowball phenomenon that is very real. The best you can do is to be as positive as you can as often as you can, and hope to be the seed that shifts the trend from negative to positive.
---
I would say if you are bored now wait until raids! Your rotation as a mage is very complex as it involves hitting frostbolt.
---
Just frostbolt...
---
I didn't want to use a lot of add-ons for classic.
---
But I am for just this 
---
4 pages of 1c bid 35s buyout
---
The 5th page is all 20c buyout or something
---
Man that's a real [Soul Breaker]. You must be full of [Tearfall Bracers] now. The [Wailing Nightbane Pauldrons] can probably be heard all the way from UC.
---
What do you reckon, how many [Wildheart Gloves] will you accumulate while waiting for it to drop again?
---
Nope, I'm leaving a single mushroom
---
Yea they were selling for like 5 g on my realm
---
I love how alliance players are always bitter whereas the horde players are just enjoying themselves.
---
Well this is speculation since this is not out yet BUT if memory serves (and this can be fact checked when the game is out, Sylvanas, Arthas and Illidan are now voiced by their WoW VAs). 
---
Again take this with a load of salt, not long left now.
---
HEY SHUT THE HELL UP I AM NOT EASY TO OFFEND PEOPLE SAY I HAVE THE THICKEST SKIN, THE BEST SKIN, NO ONE GETS OFFENDED LESS THAN ME!
---
Nope, I was referring to their comment. You’re the one who inserted yourself in that conversation despite apparently not having read it.
---
Anyway we really are done now, I’m very much bored of you. Have a good one!
---
Horde. Because even though I already spent years playing them, I can't bring myself to play boring humanoid characters.
---
One other tip, you can spam hamstring to proc windfury on bosses/single mob pulls.
---
Thanks for doing the equivalent of freeing the slaves, lets find some black ppl to worship your heroism.
---
Or just treat them like people? Maybe?
---
&gt;All it takes one example from the distant past showing at least one person was saying "could of"
---
I don't consider that a random occurence of something like that should be used as the baseline of an argument in favor of spreading what is originally a mistake.
---
&gt; Shoulda doesn't even sound like Should've, how is that intutive?
---
Because the contraction makes sense when you read it, independently of how one does pronounce it in its own subdialect of English.
---
-&gt; Should (h)a(ve)
---
Yep and i've also been waking up an hour earlier before class just to play. My sleep schedule has been ruined ever since the release of Classic.
---
Just for reference I sold 1 stack of thick leather this morning for 10g and 1 of rugged leather for 20g this morning.
---
Yea I'm disappointed by it too. My favorite part of classic was the cross faction rivalries developed vs certain players and guild. 
---
We'll have some of that in P2 with the pvp system with no Bags but then we'll lose it.
---
No, Rogues can go into stealth to hide the fact that everyone who plays UD rogue has a tiny tiny penis.
---
    Queue the boomer music
---
Rank 3 fort costs 400 for a priest to cast and we don't stack int as hard as you which means our mana pool is half the size. Sure, you could argue that stacking spirit means our mana comes back faster but you can make water out of thin air..
---
No, that’s why not every class can do it. It was added flavor that made warlocks fun.
---
It's tough to do if you don't have blues for Intel. It's extremely damanding for mana so you need a good sized mana pool. I'm 34 mage aoe build. I died a lot at first but you get better with practice. Honestly though it might be better just to go single target build. So many mages are doing aoe farm build so it's hard to even find a farm spot without 3-4 mages grinding already. Also a lot of the locations are in contested territory so if you're on pvp server you can get ganked a lot.
---
I mean.... just play a lock... you get your 40 mount for free. EZ
---
Yes because it was balanced for the classes and their stats, abilities at launch (version 1.0) we are in version 1.12/1.13. 
---
Just read all the patch notes to see all the changes over the various patches. Tons of buffs.

In each of these patches there is balance changes to classes including complete revamps and buffing. There was 11 patches from launch to where we are now and since MC was made/balanced for the original class balancing that means the dungeon is 11 patches out of date. As higher grade content is released things will level out since that's what the classes are now balanced for.
---
yep 100% the standard. I keep tabs on assholes, as a healer one whisper to the leader is all thats needed. "Hey that guy is a prick I don't want to spend an hour plus in this dungeon with him, I'll hop out so you can find another healer" There's a high chance that the leader is going to drop the asshat and ask me to stay. I know if they are an asshole to me they'll be one to more people and eventually need to reroll or move servers.
---
even worse is when you see him and his wife as young childs in WOD, promising to each other that they will always stick with each other
---
Haha. They try to bully and guilt trip me with IRL junk, but it doesn't work really. I'm pretty good at standing ground when its important. Just feel bad for the husband, who is torn all the time on what to do/say/act with his family. He's pretty passive, and just goes with whatever his dad says, because 'that's just how he is'. I enjoy playing with my husband, but I certainly am not going to dictate with who or what he does in a game. Just silly to me. Lol
---
&gt;You're not supposed to be able to solo elite mobs in classic
---
**laughs in hunter**
---
Yes but I can skin a mob. My paws are too clumsy to eat a flank of wolf meat? but also delicate enough to pick flowers and carefully skin a rabbit
---
I thought evis was a static damage ability? So the only stat that really affects it is crit?
---
There's literally no excuse for not making a 2 stacks of water for a single healer.  That's easy.
---
Again, I say that as a mage who played when the best end-game water had to be conjured 2 at a time.
---
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls
---
Sure in the future people will have gold. I didn't really think that was the scenario you were presenting.
---
How dead is it? Thinking of switching from Whitemane. Can you find a group? Are there any guilds?
---
Oh the pure joys of being a rogue, you filthy bastard i love it.
---
Got mine today too! Celebrated by doing the fishing and cooking artisan quests, so much faster with a steed :D 
---
Completely broke. If I wasn’t a lock I would’ve gotten my mount around level 59 😂
---
45 hunter- 4 days 6hrs
---
That and I got my previous weapon and could put demons laying on it immediately for that sweet glow. I’m a warlock so the enchant does nothing but aesthetics but there was no one to stop me ☺️
---
couple random things...sunder always does bonus threat even if it's already at 5 stacks, so you can continually sunder for more and more threat
---
I don't think you can work shield wall etc into a 'rotation,' it's entirely situational
---
heroic strike turns your auto attack into a yellow hit meaning it can't glance, (and therefore has a higher crit chance) so it's worth more for threat than you might assume, also later on you will not be rage starved, ever, and you will just spam this
---
Wow, dude.
---
You're literally pissed off that people used their professions to make money.
---
Get a grip, man.
---
And with mages we could do chronomancer healing.
---
Lol yeah. I thought adult stuff and other games would keep me going strong, as i was on a long break like you. Classic totally reinvigorated that for me. Ive hunted like one monster in the mew MHWorld xpac and i havent touched the mordhau or underlords patches yet... too much wow
---
I don't disagree with you. Its a tightrope walk to keep things different without overdoing it or making other, more important things, trivial. It's more a pipedream on my end because of how much I enjoyed MoP and Brewmaster Monks but it's not something I would ever demand be in a game that means this much to people. 
---
I think classic needs to stay just that: classic. See it through all these phases they have planned and see what happens with the game at that point. Maybe they make changes to future retail expansions based on the popularity and success of classic or maybe nothing changes on either side and classic lives on while retail does whatever else. We'll see what happens!
---
Commenting to come back, nearly can complete this thanks.
---
Been trying to do as little planning as i can while leveling, but for a 14 slot bag i have too.
---
That's what I do! I whisper them some smack like "your gold sux" and then report lol
---
This made me so proud
---
On my server players trade me like 5boxes at once, or 3 whatever i unlock them loot them than send loot all in "partyy" to see loot.
---
We're all Grand Marshal / High Warlord Redditors here.
---
Ive even seen arms wars roll on shields that the one tanking needed. Open to all
---
This is not the definition of ninja looting.  Ninja looting is when the leader will switch to master looter so everyone else has NO chance at the item
---
I don’t know a guide, but in general you only want to heal as much as needed. Healing for more than the target can receive is over healing and a waste of mana. So that’s why people use lower ranks of their healing spells. Obviously use the full rank if the target needs the full heal. 
---
Also wand in between healing, and try to regen mana by not casting for 5 seconds. After 5 secs of not casting (you can wand) you start to regenerate mana again until you heal.
---
Stack spirit, as this increases your regen
---
Lol this is amazing. I hope you don’t take this wrong (as I’m not sure how many people in Hong Kong can read, write and speak English well), but for coming from Hong Kong this is very well written! I thoroughly enjoyed this lol... and this is coming from a true horde fan lol.
---
Isn't At War only retail?  It's not available in Classic, right?
---
report these motherfuckers who want your account and credit card
---
No way! Im enraging!! Blizzard please revert changes! (You dont want am army of Warlocks as enemies) _trust me_
---
Very informative! Thank you so much. Ill check out the links as soon as I can.
---
I've never received one for anything.
---
hahahhaa
---
How will it be different?
---
Devil's advocate here, in the 10 years that I've played this game I have yet to receive a spam invite to a channel.
---
Once I hit 60, I headed to Hillsbrad to catch up on my mining. First I seen my fellow undead pvping some ally, I just watched and cheered him on. Then a little while later, 3 lowbies tried to jump me and I swiftly killed em in my defense. Then after that I ran across a lvl 40 ally trying to kill 2 lvl 30ish horde, so I gave him a piece of his on medicine.
---
So yeah, I killed a couple lowbies but was I really in the wrong in those situations? Sometimes there's a lot more nuance to it than most make it out to be.
---
This is a beautiful story. I have a feeling it would have gone very different if the  54 orc was a shaman ;)
---
This is why I play a priest. Feels real nice to be helpful, plus you get a lot of appreciation in instances.
---
I would absolutely love a classic version of Northrend.
---
You can't though. It's a unique (20) item.
---
I’m level 28 lol.
---
&gt; I was like come on why do so many people post this garbage
---
And an earthquake totem (much like pala concecration)   
---
Stoneskin (not like the dwarf racial, but active mitigation)  
---
tanking pets are hard to pull off i think, with positioning and stuff, but there are so much options that are already semi ready-to-go.
---
I'm currently a level 40 ret paladin. I do a mix of questing and dungeons. I usually have a hard time finding a dungeon group though since I'm not a full time healer/tank. I've been thinking of respecing to prot to find groups more easily. I'll eventually Respec to holy at 60.
---
Will respecing to prot slow down my solo leveling a lot?
---
so you leveld to gnomsih for the special tools then dropped it and did it again and went goblin?! i didnt realize you could do that
---
[Another one](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2ryw6/another_unsuspecting_victim_sacrificed_to_the/)
---
Yeah I have been waiting with a guild because I see all of these random invites but I want to join a guild of people I meet and will actually play with
---
I wonder for how much that inner fire hit before the mindblast lul
---
Rogue is nuts. My warrior gets wrecked if I pull more than one mob. My rogue can kill 2-3 with all the potions and food buffs I roid out on, and if it gets too hot, sprint is a poor man's vanish. Just don't use it to get to places, use it to get away. If you have any other questions, I've been playing a rogue for twelve years.
---
I can tell you're new, by nothing on your multi action bars being keybound. Get some keybinds !
---
Its pretty annoying that this was not implemented way sooner.
---
The type of player to abuse this goes in early and often. Reality now is that everyone else gets to play fair afterwards.
---
Just hit 38 and think I’ve put in quite a lot of time. Maybe 2-3 hours every single day and they are doing what I hope to be doing in 5-6 months.
---
Thanks for the replies guys!
---
Regardless if you are alliance or horde, that was a fun scenario to read! Your quick reflexes saved you. Great job! I am horde, and many times I have had alliance pick me off when I have a mob at 10%. You get those cowards on both sides of the fence!
---
My name is Micur and thought I had these cloth shoulders in the bag, still lost 😭

---
Monkey see monkey do
---
That could literally have happened at any point of the game's history.
---
Relentless Pursuit as an orc hunter would piss rouges off so much.
---
Any you highly recommend?
---
I don't know how much faster it is possible to kill mobs compared to what I am doing at the moment (max 25 secs, avrg. 18-20 secs and with the right crits around 15 seconds). I am primarily holy at the moment, which is where I am coming from right now, and 25% spell/healing power from 323 spirit (without spirit tap) is pretty insane. 
---
How fast are you clearing mobs with shadow (same level)? I am too cheap to respecc just to try it out, because honestly I am doing much better than I initially expected with my current build. I am planning on switching to shadow when I got my epic mount, and phase 2 hits.
---
I'm not sure if you are open to guides and things like that, but I follow the leveling guide from [wowclassic.live](https://wowclassic.live) and I never miss a step. I always am pointed to the important quests and zones at appropriate levels. I even played back in vanilla and private servers and there are zones I never even considered leveling in that have some great exp and rewards..
---
Cheers

Large enemy group -&gt; demo shout

---
Also not sure why you're downvoting me when I'm right. Unable to accept it I suppose? I better not see a post on here in the future crying about not getting accepted to any raid groups because you're Ret.
---
I just rolled magus and called it close enough lol
---
LETS GO!!!!!
---
Yeah, if we find ore everybody who can mine it rolls for it, mostly it gets shared if theres a skill point opportunity for at least one of the party members. But those things are different from locked chests. 
---
Its like the mage asking your group for money to cast water, we are in this dungeon as a group and if one of those party members acts selfish they can fuck right off, especially rogues who are pretty much useless in most 5 man dungeons but always manage to focus that one target no one else is attacking. 
---
Nah fuck this selfish behaviour, i play druid and i have to pay silver for reagents to battle rezz but i don't go around telling people to pay me for a rez, we a groupe and we WORK TOGETHER. 
---
And no back then i played a rogue and you would always unlock the chest and either tell anyone what's in there and roll if two guys wanted the same or roll for the chest as whole, every rogue who just claimed it for himself ended up replaced by a less selfish dps, as it should be.
---
Ret Paladin
---
DON'T JUDGE ME
---
Do you have any advice? I went for Warrior this time around and it’s been very slow (and rewarding) but I had no clue how many things the tank has to do.
---
Haha, love it! Glad to know you're having so much fun with it! :)
---
Granted, this was a new ass game and we hadn't been playing it for 15 years, including playing on private servers and doing this already repeatedly.
---
Leveling addons, leveling layer methods, refined XP routes and all that.  Remove leveling from the mix, which was more of a hurdle originally.
---
Add in 12 patches worth of class adjustments, and whatnot.
---
MC / the game isn't how it was in 2004, it's a weird hybrid state.
---
Play something but a hunter.  There's a reason they're known as the best leveller, best solo, best for taking on elites.  You picked easy mode and then complained the game was too casual.
---
The other day I helped a few guys out in Tanaris get the chests from the mobs there by aggroing them while they looted. It felt good, plus they helped me kill the mobs after. 
---
The funny thing is, all 3 of them still offered to roll for it even though I knew they were going for it first. People are good :)
---
This. Im an undead rogue in an RPPVP server. Last week I saw a chest and went to get it, but as I was approaching, I saw an orc rogue going for it as well. I got there first, and as I opened the chest and proceeded to go away I /silly'd, just to tell her a joke after the ironic episode. The rogue called me a douchebag in general chat, but I told her I take roleplaying as a rogue very seriously.
---
Alliance*
---
&gt; Legion was an attempt to regain this with Class Halls and I think that it worked pretty well for that.
---
It did, then we promptly abandoned them like nearly every good idea to come from an expansion.
---
These are sick. I would totally play as a support warrior in a battleground. The hunter one is great too and the apellsword is super cool. 10/10 gimme more of these!
---
Or you saw them because they never sold

Who are you to say that everyone’s character is a benevolent honor bound champion?
---
Do you have somewhere with a guide for warrior macros like setting raid targets? I've been doing skull and stuff manually
---
I've had this happen 3 times to my warrior so far. Mostly been lurking casters too.
---
 I've had to body pull 2 or 3 mobs. 1 at a time obviously to get to the chest. Don't run in when I'm clearing the 3rd mob loot the chest and run off.
---
Join the r/hydrohomies army and hand out conjured water to the casters
---
I had the same thing happen to me. I was a measly level 45 and I had never seen an epic, so I looked on thottbot and saw that the neutral turtles in tanaris had 'higher' drop rates. Spent hours killing them until I got the Ardent Custodian. Sold it for about 45 gold and felt like the king of the world that day.
---
I've always thought the Culling of Stratholme mission did the whole thing where the moral choice would be to shut off the game and walk away years before *Spec Ops: The Line.*

Except normal is relative. Your normal isn't my normal, and mine isn't OPs. Play the game how you want, but don't shit on people for sharing their accomplishments.

---
Skill? SKILL!
---
And as a priest, the most important thing for levelling is your wand! That and taking the wand talents and spirit tap talents as first priority. Your wand will do more dps than a lot of your early spells, and costs no mana
---
I tried to help a hunter who was apparently taming a raptor in the Barrens (there's one spot that spawns a higher level raptor).
---
Big mistake, he cussed me out calling me all sorts of names. I was like "just tryin to help dude, yw for the buff btw."
---
"I dispelled your shitty buff, don't need your dirty help!"
---
There wasn't much point to continuing the discussion. Still, one bad experience among hundreds of good ones. Nothing better than realizing you're traveling along the same road to get to some other town with another 'buffer' like a druid or mage and both of you realize it about the same time and buff each other, haha.
---
lvl 40, 4 days, mage
---
Thank you for helping how you do. I'm sure people appreciate it (: I know I would
---
Ofcourse it’s bad if people do it all day every day. But that’s why bans exist. There’s no harm in every once in a while. If an infernal is up while you’re in Goldshire, tough shit. Go do something else. If you get corpsecamped on a PvP server you have to do that too. Should they remove PvP server?
---
I’m so sick of them removing fun from the game because players like you need their safe space.
---
As a druid, I wish I could just do this but my 30 min CD prevents such generosity. So I stick to healing and buffing anyone I see instead.
---
This. Although it can be a pain to correctly type some of the names these spammers are using. I reported one, then just blocked channel invites. 
---
There's more value for me in blocking these assholes than in getting a legit invite to a custom channel, something that has never happened to me in 13 years of playing.
---
I meant ratchet! Far safer there than booty bay, my mistake
---
Sure is, you've got a keen eye
---
Lol nice.
---
Also what energy regen addon do you use? The ones I've tried don't work
---
I agree, while leveling my Rogue back in Vanilla/TBC retail (it took me that long), I was constantly on the verge of quitting because Combat is that damn boring.
---
I wish Dagger builds were a bit more viable outside of PvP, I always had more fun with them. Rogue definitely got a PvE facelift in WotLK with more viable builds.
---
That's the most frustrating part. It tells you the name of the chat channel you ignored an invite from and they still get the advertising they want.
---
Ok, if you want to report whoever sends the channel invite all you need to do is /w them. Once you say something, you can just right click their name in the chat box and report them through that way. At least that's what I do.
---

This actually helped me for that quest in STV near the Horde base camp :D
---
Capitalize All Words Or The Words Will Capitalize On You
---
I felt this way until I failed Stranglethorn Fever and had to go back to grinding gorillas with a ton of mages AOE farming them. Seriously, no thanks.
---
Arcane Warrior from Dragon Age is what I think of
---
Thanks! I'll keep this in mind. I'm sure I'll still waiver back and forth on Hunter vs Warrior for a while, but at least I feel good about my choices on Warrior if I go that route. :P
---
Level 42 Fury Warrior woth Vanquisher's Sword and Sword of Omen. Where should I look for my next upgrades? ZF after a few more levels?
---
Yep, works now
---
Booty Bay is my choice because it gives good access to lower Eastern Kingdoms and the boat takes me to Ratchet which is much further south than any of my other options in Kalimdor really.
---
BB &gt; SW &gt; IF
---
BB &gt; Rachet &gt; Theramore &gt; Menithil &gt; Plague Lands

BB &gt; Rachet &gt; Theramore &gt; Menithil &gt; Auberdine &gt; Darnassus
---
BB &gt; Rachet &gt; Cenarion Point (I think, that one in Silithus)
---
No singular great time save or ease of life but it makes world travel so much easier.
---
ooh, that gave me an idea. Imagine:  
---
Some earth armor that absorbs X  
---
On taking 1/4 of X you spawn a small earth elemental (much like the wild imps) up to 4.  
---
1/4th of the damage you take get tranfered to that pet, for each pet alive.  
---
random thought, numbers might be off, but it's the concept.
---
5 wand, 5 spirit tap, 2 shadow word pain, 5  shadow focus, 2 fort, 5 shield, then whatever you want really for leveling, I'm pushing into shadow for shadow weaving etc. Get the enchanter made wands, then upgrade from quest rewards.
---
BRD and UBRS portals work to port you to the instances.
---
When BWL releases in Phase 3, speed run guilds won't waste time getting attuned to get into BWL and get the first Nef kill, they will go through UBRS portal.
---
The same idea was going to be used for Naxx, but they instead went with the attunement/port outside of Strat.  Naxx was supposed to be floating above Strat, but they moved to out to EPL.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1esdGySyQs
---
Go for unarmed next
---
General rule is, if it’s an upgrade...roll need
---
A few bars from 35. Not sure on played. Probably a little over 3 days.
---
51 druid - 5 days 7hrs. Spent the first 35levels without questing add-on , would not recommend. However, do recommend dungeon grinding runs for good gear and fast levels early on.
---
Sometimes I hate myself for picking a PVP server, but those times when players get tired of horde attacks, group up and repeatedly destroy them makes it all worthwhile.
---
Cat is for fite
---
This im so Fed up with this spellcleave stuff i never het into proper groups cause i can't aoe
---
Killing a lvl 29 warrior is like kicking a 3 days old kitten. Shame on you sir!
---
He picked the wrong stream to hack on
---
I've noticed a few people making very questionable need rolls. 'I need mount money...'
---
Horde
---
It will be different because we are much stronger than we were when it was released. We have newer updated talent trees, skills and other class balances that occurred throughout vanilla. Some of the items in the game now were added and balenced throughout vanilla. We also on average are better at games, 15 years ago online gaming had really only taken off a few years before.
---
I'M at 19 runs on my shaman so far and it dropped on run 17th, the warrior got it and haven't seen it drop since.
---
Shouldn't be necessary to put it that way. People get offended over the silliest of things.
---

---
For my warlock friends.
---
" while retail is tuned towards single player"
---
Thats a big no. Classes in retail get nerfed or buffed based on Raid, PvP and M+ performance. No class is nerfed because they clear leveling 10% faster than others.
---
Im going home after work for day 3 of farming Ravager, averaging 3.3 runs per hour for atleas 5 hours a day. Seen one drop. Cock weapon.
---
I believe it can affect the percentage of higher quality fish you catch over time.
---
Here's a more comprehensive guide to vanilla fishing: [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Fishing](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Fishing)
---
Level 19? Str and Agility are great for damage but...do not underestimate Spirit. With a lot of spirit you can greatly reduce your downtime between mobs, and it saves you money from buying food. In my early/mid 20's  I had +30'ish Spirit and when sitting down I was regenerating somewhere between 80-100 health per tick. My gear now has zero spirit, and I regen less health now than I did at level 25, and I depend on food that's 20 silver per 5.
---
Killing things slightly faster can be outweighed time-wise by having to rest less between mobs.
---
NO JOKES ALLOWED, SARCASM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED HERE &gt;:(
---
Alliance propaganda!
---
Ratchet dock, it’s a fisherman who you turn wish in to and it’s 50 or 55 silver. I’m ally so there may be another, and idk how hard the fish are to get but I know it’s repeatable and upwards of 50s per turn in
---
Probably the server they play on is my guess?  I play on 2-3 very high pop servers so I get about 3-4 of these per session (approx 4-5 hours a day)  I have the request option set to off but I still get a notification in my chat box that it was auto-declined.
---
You can replace your skills with macros that simply have /startattack in them
---
I would probably wait to see if the hunter in your group rolls need. If he rolls greed you'd be safe to need it.
---
Turn down for what
---
I’m on Blaumeux, is it alliance heavy? I was chatting with my guild last night and they said it was horde heavy...does anyone have stats?
---
Wow, have the news stations been at your door?
---
Goosebumps
---
Could be interesting. Doesn't hurt to speculate.
---
Well since ghost wolf (and druid forms) are buffs, /cancelaura works just fine
---
Source: all my forms are /cancelaura macros
---
How many Classes is this BIS for anyway?
---
Ok #somechanges and I want Trickster NOW!
---
You are just plain wrong and just afraid of the unknown but blizzard would never let a relm die. They would merge relms if need be.
---
You still get the notification in your chat box though. Which is in itself annoying as well.
---
A rogue that didnt level lockpicking is like a warrior that didnt level defense or a hunter that never tamed a pet, insta kick and replace
---
45 and no mount yet? What hVe you two been spending your gold on?
---
Peaceful /wave squad unite!
---
Amen.
---
Warris and Paladins both.
---
Nothing but respect for people who go through that hell.
---
Yea rly dislike it. Made me reroll from hunter to mage. Doing armory and cath for 40-50k xp per hour is rly fun though
---
Just put your mats and stuff on the AH from both your professions you've been leveling.
---
Thats 4 professions. EZ money.
---
I bet less than 7% killed a boss there let alone cleared it.
---
We had the entire game on farm minus Cthun before Naxx. Tens of thousands of gold in guild bank. We ran out of resources/tanks/will to play and the guild disbanded after a few months of being ground down by Naxx. You needed 6-8 GEARED tanks on Four Horsemen.
---
Priest and shadow priest in particular are surprisingly durable for a clothie.
---
At one point in alpha they were still toying with the Idea that priests could spec to tank.
---
Well the warrior should try meowing more and being more cute!
---
So just to be clear, you want the devs to intentionally put something back into the game that they will ban anyone for doing? Thereby making more work for themselves in the process? Is there anything outside of greifing that would benefit from putting this back in? Because otherwise that makes no sense for them to do.
---
Completely hooked. Life including work and socialising revolve around playing wow.
---
Source?
---
Guilty I am.
---
Farm Fire Elementals in Arathi Highlands. They Drop Elemental Fire and Things for a warrior Quest. got me about 15-20g/hour
---
Sorry to hear that man. Hopefully you get it soon!
---
My biggest tip is getting together a team of cloth / leather wearers. Or even inviting plate wearers that already have it?
---
GODS SPEED!
---

---
Yeah, I am. Does that qualify me to hold this opinion in your eyes?
---
I’m not having any problems, my condolences to you
---
Yeah, but "potential to wipe out your own species" sounds like a pretty big drawback to me :P
---
Alliance counting on guards to win at pvp? That rarely happens /s
---
Steam Link is the answer you seek
---
45 warrior 6 days played as well. Most of that was corpse runs from getting ganked though so would probably be closer to 5 days played if not for that.
---
In the water...
---
Hey Warlocks! I know I'm a little late to the party, but this is a macro to give healthstones to people you pass by. It's a nice gesture if you can:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyaedv/for\_my\_fellow\_warlocks\_who\_want\_to\_hand\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyaedv/for_my_fellow_warlocks_who_want_to_hand_out/)
---
I think it’s best to view enhance in pvp as you would in a raid. They are support for melee groups. 
---
In a 1v1 enhance is the worst of the 3, resto was generally the best dueling spec but ele is good too. 
---
I’m not sure it makes a whole lot of sense to base a reroll around wpvp at midgame as you’ll only be looking to make a similar switch when you realize your new class also gets rock paper scissored around the same level.
---
Doesn't everyone do this already?  It's pretty impossible to get from 10 (or even 12) to 20 in just the barrens.  I always go to silverpine at level 15 or so to knock out a quick 2 levels.
---
How viable is it for a new character to explore as much of the map as possible before starting questing? I appreciate this could take MANY hours but by the time you go full circle you could be level 6 or so purely from discovery XP, and it would speed things up when you actually got back to the starting area. Plus you’d have loads of flight paths which could always come in handy further down the line.
---
Has anyone done this? What’s a viable route from each starting zone. I’m thinking of putting a bit of work into researching this, and will obviously share it, but if anyone could give some guidance I’d appreciate it. I feel like Undead would be a good starting point (Tirisfal Glades) cos it’s on a whole other island to the rest so could do that first and then get the boat to Orgrimmar once you’ve uncovered as much as possible. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
FWIW I’m not interested in Alliance, but others may be.
---
I farmed on mobs from 38-40, vendoring everything that dropped (including greens as they'll range from 20-50s). It was for sure mindless grind.
---
Other way is just keep questing as quests will have you slay tons of enemies which will drop loot in the same fashion.
---
(I farmed mobs in the badlands if you are wondering)
---
wow, so authentic vanilla they made movement client side again
---
just more pwoof classic devs tryn sabotage
---
No changes!!!one1 /s
---
Yeah maybe it is 1.5 levels, I always thought it was around 2 levels though. Either way, you can push 1.5 levels into 3 levels if you do it right. Fill up your quest log full of "Complete" quests, as many as you can - then put your character in a rested area for a week or two. Then login, turn in ALL your quests, boom you've just pushed that rested XP further by a ton.
---
That's fine and dandy, but I'm going to charge you for my Resurrection when you die from pulling aggro from the tank, this is fair because you're causing more issue for the tank and making the healer take more mana breaks, so me letting you die and run back will amount to the same amount of time as it would be if I had to constantly heal you from pulling aggro. A skill that cost me gold to learn, mana to use, which is then replenished by water I purchased (which isn't cheap) Or better yet, I'll tell the group the healer is going to leave because I don't wanna run with an asshat. I've leveled a rogue and lock picking everyone makes it sound so difficult when it's not it's just time consuming.
---
I haven’t had any issues personally, I make my own groups when I can and take anyone who’s level appropriate and willing, but it’s all I hear my ex-rogues complain about, but yeah it probably has a lot to do with server/social groups
---
Welcome to the Ef Gang!
---
I dont understand why but there's a lot of things on my realm with buyouts below vendor what a vendor would pay.
---
In Desolace atm doing the quests slowly but yeah Quest XP isnt any use, done some of 1k needles but wasnt high enough to finish it out....
---
You can’t really make a guide because the rank you need is different than the rank another healer needs based on gear adding to the healing power of the spell. As all the others have said, only your experience will show you what you need as your gear changes. IIRC I had 3 ranks of each heal on my bars back in vanilla at 60, the top, one 2-3 ranks lower and Maybe a 5 rank from max.
---
Interesting, I have played mage for 15 years, and I almost never fireblast a mob before moving on to the next. In classic, it is just not dps or mana efficient to do this, I'm way better off just switching targets with frostbolt/fireball. 
---
Rogues, will stay if the have combo points to spend. Hunters will always leave their pets on a mob until it's dead. Warlocks have DoTs which almost never even reach the end of their duration.
---
Not anyone, just chain abusers. Like many things in the game, this would be perfectly okay to do every once in a while, but harassment to do it constantly.
---
Lol just scrolled down and found it...  Thanks
---
That offends me.
---
People always talk about all the Hillsbrad PvP but I havent had this yet. 
---
I've ran past a few allies but we both havent attacked us. I attacked a paladin once after waiting for him to heal after a fight. Then he almost murdered me after using his instafullheal and I ran away in spirit wolf.
---
But that was honestly all the PvP I've had there. I've seen a ton of allies while fighting Murlocs but there was also a good chunk of horde so I guess nobody wanted to start the war and have everyone die. Just kinda killed Murlocs beside one another.
---
Albeit it was too stressfull for me so I used water breathing and continued to kill all the murlocs from below the surface of the water. Ohh and I've seen a few allies while helping a warrior with the whirlwind axe elite. But they just helped to kill the elite and went their marry way.
---
Good find!
---
I found my atlas and it has been so helpful.
---
I did a four pally group the other night and we decimated. 4 auras and plenty of blessings, our warrior was just whirlwinding things into the ground. I think with a fifth pally it may become redundant and be less effective than buffing powerful aoe class, but it’s certainly doable
---
IIRC there are item engineer items that only the gnome race (seperate from Gnomish Engineering) because they have Engi specialization. Where can I find the unique items? Having a hard time
---
Unless you have friends that are on one of the "High" or "Full" realms I wouldn't start there now.    
---
Honestly, though?  Queue time isn't a problem for me.  I just log in after dinner and go take the dogs for a nice walk.  Usually by the time I get back I've only got to wait for 10-15 minutes to play.
---

This exact same person did this to me last night. I spent 7 or 8 minutes trying to figure out how to report it. (I’m brand new to WoW) I spent a lot more time than most folks would. They really need to make it easier. (I still don’t know how to report someone)
---
You're my hero
---
Thank you, I have to live with what I have done for the rest of my life
---
If you don't mind, why do you regret it?
---
Please clarify if you had to drop engineering completely or if you can just select
---
Caster DPS Monk would be neat, or even a caster DPS Demon Hunter.
---
it was client side, they fixed it in retail like 3 xpacs ago, u don't see dozens of goldfarming bots on every server flying around under the map mining nodes anymore in retail because u can't do it anymore
---
What is an appropriate tip for a TP?
---
Man, my retail main was a blood elf paladin so imma have to pass on the faction specific part of that. Tauren dont need em tho. Just belf
---
I just seduce and /kiss my questing enemies. And promptly free them from my charm.
---
2 stacks is standard-issue.  That's not drowning at all.
---
In vanilla this was so well understood that nobody ever even had to ask for water.   Healer zones into the dungeon, and a trade window would be immediately opened and 2 stacks of water would be offered.
---
Nonsense. There's plenty reason to not spend mana if you don't have to.
---
So I havent played the game in about 10 years and decided to role Alliance this time around, since I havent done much of that content. I also wanted to roll with a caster (never played one) and chose a priest to better serve a dungeon group. I read your post yesterday and kind of understood it but ended up healing the Deadmines for the first time yesterday. First time in that dungeon and first as a healer. Everything went great, no wipes. 
---
We did have a Warlock in the group though and he did this exact thing every...fucking...pull. He was starting off every fight with like 25% health AFTER I had just drank. So every pull starts and I'm like, WTF I need to focus on the tank and NOW i need to heal you? Why didnt you just drink when I was drinking? Luckily I didnt need to say anything and the group did for me. At first he's like, why do i need to drink when I can life tap? In which the responded, why doesnt the priest stop healing up your life tap? This post made way more sense after!
---
That ain’t how law of averages works dawg 😂
---
People just want to play the game normally. They don’t want to have to deal with giant streamer raids and everything else. Can’t say much about the people playing WoW from twitch as I don’t know any but if it’s any of the shit that you see in Twitch chat channels I can see that being an issue for most.
---
That was the problem back then, with 40 people at least 5 would be just space filler that couldn't pay attention to anything going on around them. Normally its just a big of extra DPS over an empty slot, but on Geddon that is where they first become a liability.
---
Yeah feel like lot of zones are simple under horde control all the time. Shame that the server we can migrate to is super low-pop which might be even worse in terms of group finding.
---

---
Next time you run a dungeon, make sure you are party leader and put it as Need before Greed instead of group loot. That hunter wouldn't have been able to roll on it then.
---
Because they're far easier to kill and yield almost as much exp. Kill them twice as fast and get 90% as much exp. Seems like a good deal to me.
---
I’m a level 22 undead mage. How do I level/learn wolf riding? Is this a level 20 mount?

Its great isn’t it!
---
You fishing wreckage nodes? Bolts of mageweave and runecloth along with greens netted me some reel big profits.
---
They weren't an "integral part of vanilla". They were against TOS.

There’s a setting in the interface to do it.
---
WTB William Shatner reading this
---
which is a one reason why i rolled alliance pve.  i have a large playerbase to draw from for pve content and will have fast queues when BGs finally arrive.  not a world pvp fan at all so i'm not missing anything in that regard
---
Blackjak, I look forward to fighting you...in phase 3 with CR bgs
---
I know right? I thought on applying some filter but it looks great the way it is.
---
Yup, I've gotten a few of these too.  There should be a way to report these assholes.
---
Why can't I just report someone by name?  Why can't I just type in /report 'player_name' and it opens a window where I can add details and submit?  Why is that so hard?
---
I feel like WoW's success cemented the available classes into the standard for MMOs, but for anyone who plays tabletop RPG like DnD, there's 100s of class fantasies that unfortunately don't make it into video games usually.
---
/cancelform works by itself, I have so many macros for this its stupid... mucho frustrating
---
The thing that makes me anxious is being called a ninja for being a healer needing healing gear as a pally (Took come cloth int boots from a mage and got called a ninja).
---
While a healer shouldnt roll need on a 2h axe, people dont seem to understand what gear is good isnt always the obvious stuff (paladin t0 has garbage itemization and I want none of it, for instance). So people start sceaming about stuff they dont understand.
---
&gt;I think it's amazing that people think everyone should just match the schedule of the guildmaster.
---
The reality of any large organization is that it's going to be driven by a very small group of people. 
---
If you make a guild, find when people are good to raid, and that time doesn't fit with the people who are willing to invest the time to organize everything and make it happen...you won't succeed. 
---
You need that person or more realistically those 2-4 people who you know are going to be incredibly consistent at showing up to raid night, organizing things beforehand, keeping track of loot, finding people to fill in when others can't make it, making roster decisions, recruiting for the guild, etc. 
---
Without those people, your raids will never actually happen. 
---
So yes, if you're recruiting, you absolutely have to find raiders who fit the schedule of the players who are going to lead as opposed to finding a schedule for the players who just want to show up. 
---
&gt;I'm saying create a guild, amasse a huge amount of people while leveling... and after a few weeks create a poll to determine when people are mostly available.
---
So if raiding is important to someone at endgame, joining this guild would be a gamble. Like, unless you're available every night of the week, why join a guild that doesn't have a schedule? When they get around to having one, if it doesn't fit your availability then you have to go find another guild. 
---
What you're suggesting is joining a leveling guild and just trying to make it work for raiding, which is a fine idea, but most of the players who have their eyes on clearing the raids are already looking for a guild where they can block a specific evening or evenings off for.
---
If you use your wand often, get one with high dps
---
Mainhand and offhand (or staff) is just for stats
---
I’m attempting to do this on Mac and iOS but am having some trouble with the “different networks” portion. I tried to set it up as described, but it seems to only connect on the same network. Do I need to opt in to a beta build of steam to access the “anywhere” portion of steam link?
---
Against the opposite faction, it's acceptable. But same faction? That's shitty.
---
Because I want to understand why you would even post this lol
---
&gt;since I'm not a full time healer
---
You are, you just don't know it yet :)
---
Spec doesn't matter while leveling for healing. Worst case is you wait 1-2 levels longer until you go into the instance. You will be fine and healers are in high demand, so you should be able to find a group.
---
yeah but she can be a cold bitch at times.
---
I've been doing herb runs for briarthorn to get a stockpile of Swiftness Potions for when the battlegrounds start releasing and one of my favorite things to do is drive-by ghost wolf bites on mobs that lower level players are fighting or struggling with. It costs me nothing to put my agi/str gear to use and get a relatively damaging bite in on a mob that might save someone a little time as they quest. I also look for people with low health trying to run after an unfortunate pull so I can either give them a quick heal or drop a slowing totem to buy them time.
---
I just love the community aspect of this game and how small gestures can have big impacts.
---
Well that cast on yourself if not mousing over anyone?
---
It’s not that it is super difficult as much as it much more difficult than any other class imho.
---
Its a  low pop server, Dragonfang EU, and all our high level guild mages are aoe farming in zf all the time.
---
Just because info is more miserable by default doesn't mean it's cheap or unintended for an add-on like this to exist. If blizzard had intended it to work differently they would have made it so stealth doesn't appear in CL.
---
Rogues are assholes anyways so just enjoy shitting on them.
---
Happened to me too. Tried to report them but couldn't find a way to do so.
---
We getttt itttttt. This is 2 years overdone.
---
yes for example
---
/cast battle stance
---
/cast charge
---
I'm not sure if you can change weapons and cast a skill with 1 click
---
Same , playing druid right now and I love buffing every player I see , I especially like to help out lone people questing with heals or if theyre running away from 3-4 mobs that are overwhelming them i heal them to full and put some HoTs on them so they can keep kicking ass. 
---
It's a good feeling
---
Is there ever a reason to use a higher rank Frost nova?
---
Someone got a ten slot bag from a chest that they stole while I was standing on it killing the closest mob.
---
He is horde
---
This gave me a good chuckle.  I will have to try it out
---
idk i'm new to classic and every group have been a breeze, I think i've wiped twice in dungeons since launch. People seem strangely adapt to me but I doubt it's going to stay that way long.
---
Does the camp and reset instance macro work in Classic? Like for hunters that want to solo farm Maraudon, are they having to walk back to the entrance to reset it?
---
28 years old me is screaming for you aswell
---
I'm just going to use WW Axe until Thrash Blade and swap to Fury, are you planning on staying Arms?
---
I spam REEE in the channel then leave
---
I mean mostly, I also tank. Benefits of dw fury 1h skill is always caught up haha
---
Mages have been scammers for 15 years
---
I always call the Healthstones cookies
---
What a shame it must be to spend the time complaining about an issue that will not go away, as opposed to, just downloading the free addon. You only hurt yourself.
---
They honestly should disable that and itll quit real quick
---
LOL so many people in this thread have said how hard it is to level lock picking. Time consuming doens't = difficulty.
---
You guys using your non vanilla water. Feh!
---
700 players is definitely dead. There are guilds on the bigger servers with more than 700 unique accounts in them, and anecdotally, my guild has close to 300-400 players on at peak times. Half of Earthfury's entire population is just one guild on a bigger server....
---
If it's an upgrade, just roll need.  Some people, especially if they also wanted the item, will expect you to equip BoEs and may even get mad if you don't in which case you should be happy to equip it for them and say you need it for world gear.  But for the most part people already understand warriors typically have some tanking gear and some world gear, and that leveling as a warrior is hard and you don't really wear your tanking gear outside of dungeons, so it will be rare that you ever have to explain yourself. Don't sleep on +spirit gear also.
---
Does LFG broadcast to the whole world, or just the zone you're in?
---
I love playing support warriors.
---
I think these kind of ideas would be perfect for Blizzard doing Classic+.
---
I feel you and your greatest times fellow warrior.
---
I hadn't received any until Classic. Then I started getting a few each day until I disabled chat invites. It still tells you when it blocked an invite though. I haven't seen any messages about blocked invites for a few days now though so maybe Blizzard has started cracking down on it.
---
Right on, thanks my bud!
---
Wouldn't a meth gnome be selling his stuff super cheaper because he only needs a little bit of money to get his next fix?
---
inb4 "YoU gUYs nOt HaVe PhONeS?"
---
Lmao "his face is fucking melting".
---
Love it man.
---
You know that the greed option is there if you just want it for cash right?
---
There is a reason the need before greed option makes it impossible to need gear you can't use since you don't need the item. You just want the cash, while the mage may actually need the item.
---
I’m 37 horde Druid. You can level quickly by bouncing around. Try to stick to yellow and green quests. They still give good exp before they turn silver. Southern barrens have some early 20s late teen quests. Stonetalon has some good ones for late teen and early 20s. Hills brad is mid 20s early 30s. Thousand needles is mid to late 20s early 30s. Desolace is early to late 30s. Ashenvale is early 20s to late 20s. All of those places have some good early quests that you can chain together and get good exp from and some intro quests into other zones that give good exp
---
It gives you their name in the chat log, i just send them a whisper then right click on their name, report them then ignore them
---
Great, now go replace all that gear in 3 levels &gt;.&lt;
---
I supplement all my friendliness and good deeds to the alliance with copious amounts of ganking to the horde. I can go from "What's good homie?" to "Kill that loser and make sure he dies again when he gets back up." real fast. I give my unneeded bags to people, I ambush mobs on the way to my quests, and I'm a very friendly person. However, I'm also the first to jump anyone anywhere, cities, towns, neutral zones, quest areas, roads. This is vanilla, build your faction up and tear down the opposing one. Be kind to your homies and be vicious to those red names.
---
He's a sweat for knowing class spells? lmao
---
Player killer. PK
---
Good Job.
---
Yea no filter needed.
---
Yeah, even on a smaller server it gets that way.
---
Shut the fuck up about politics and shitty jokes in LFG.  I'd like to actually use it to....*gasp*....find groups.
---
Thank you so much
---
Same. I already did the TBC grind and am not as interested as I am in seeing them go Classic+.
---
The raids and increased class viability were really nice but TBC and Wrath added a bunch of systems that started the downhill trend.
---
This is good to know. I've been wondering if leveling as a protection warrior would be a "slow but safe" path.
---
I got tired of all the bad DPS warriors who charge as soon as I try to pull etc on top of it. I'd just all around rather not deal with them.
---
So how can you tell the difference I'm pretty interested?
---
This guy invited my buddies and I multiple times in one night
---
Other classes had things like that too. Omen of Clarity proc'd on weapon attacks. Inner Fire gave attack power.
---
Shamans are just paladins who buff stone and wood statues instead of actual people. Silly shamans.
---
I think nautix7 was referring to the fact that often people dismiss anything that is not 'optimal' as not 'viable'.
---
You might be better off with a single target build, if you don't like the repetitiveness of grinding aoe mobs. Honestly, it might even be better depending on your server. All of the greatt aoe spots on my server are usually packed with like 4-6 mages at a time, and they're all fighting over the mobs and it ends up being pretty terrible xp/hour.
---
It's free loot. And it can have higher grade gear in it, its random.   
---
Also a dick move to run up and take a chest from someone who just cleared the mobs.
---
But who was cleave groups
---
I mean did you transfer to Netherwind?  we started late, and our highest level was like 44 when the Thalnos invasion started. Now there are two stratified groups, people who started on the server when the server was born, who are 30-45 with variance of course, and the Thalnos migrants who are all near 60 and almost ubiquitously obnoxious.
---
(at least the vocal Thalnossians are the worst, I'm sure there are plenty of normal players that I couldn't tell where they were from.)
---
This is awesome,  congrats on your dominance!
---
People were bad, no question.
---
"Twice as powerful" seems like a stretch. Did you make that up?
---
Tell that to Heizendingle, the gnome with cancer who sells meth to pay for cancer treatments.
---
90% of that content requires no actual communication or teamwork. LFR might as well be single player. I know it's technically not, but I doubt an outsider would be able to tell the difference between a pub and a bot.
---
I have no dog in this fight, but if you're admitting that after 15 years your memory might not be quite on point, wouldn't it stand to reason that maybe you're misremembering the leveling speed, or the comparison of it, as well? :)
---
They can as long as the mob doesn't have anything cleavy.
---
/u/sputtex oh noes! Another person working for the gold spammers!!!!!! He didnt edit it out at allllllll. Report him quick!
---
Oh nice
---
Don’t complain when they add flying mounts and micro transactions, not holding blizzard to an exacting standard is how these games get ruined.
---
I wish my dad was a shadow god
---
Solid word Tim, you had your haters but I always knew you were a gangsta
---
If you're looking for the true vanilla experience, seeing these adds are going to be part of it.
---
They said nobody had their banks full of Black Lotus, thorium bars etc.
---
But when you have 9x the resources on every server, or however many layers there are, that is obviously going to have an affect on the economy.
---
There are plenty of good people on both sides as well. That's just a lot less noticeable.
---
I always just /w &lt;Character name&gt; saying "Reported"
---
Then right click their name in chat to report for spam and comment gold spam channel invite
---
You'd love me . 69 silver tip every time as long as it's 2 stacks plus. Shit is 80s from the vend per stack. LVL 45 water
---
Just the cheese actually
---
But aren't spam reports only on a character level and only severe violations (racism, hate speech, botting, exploits, etc.) are on the account level?
---
That's at least what my understanding is...
---
Implement an easier way to report
---
?????
---
Profit
---
*puts on devil's advocate hat*
---
integral part of vanilla emergent content, perhaps
---
the rotation is gather up facetanking with ice armor --&gt; frost nova --&gt; WALK away (not blink) --&gt; blizzard #1 --&gt; blizzard #2 --&gt; kite for a few secs then frost nova --&gt; CoC + AE or blizzard #3
---
the problem you are likely having is in your 20s your gear permits not bonus mana usage. dont blink, dont mana shield. AoE grinding is really only noticeable when you get a mount + ice barrier.
---
frankly you should be questing and looking for juicy AoE grinding spots every now and then when you feel like it
---
If all else fails, just click on the red "?" help button on your options/menu hotkeys bar at the bottom of he screen. When that opens up there is a button to report a player.
---
But our res is a battle res which is super helpful in raids.
---
&gt; All language features were originally mistakes until everyone was making them.
---
That's a bit too simplistic to be true.
---
&gt; It isn't even the same sound as have.
---
It's much much closer to the sound of "have" than "of". But it's irrelevant here, as it's the fact that the "a" is a visual abreviation of "have" that matters. "Of" doesn't share the sound nor any visual clues that its supposed to replace "have".
---
You STILL get messages saying "someone invited you to a channel" with the goddamn channel name. You're not ignoring it. Just suppressing the pop-up. It's dumb.
---
Brackenwall Village to Freewind Post takes you all the way back north over XRoads.
---
That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not damaging the economy, just that it’s not apocolytic as some posts claimed. There were some fabricated images of people with bags stocked with Black Lotuses that they confirmed were fake. I think it clearly has had a noticeable impact, enough that they felt the need to hotfix out rampant abuse.
---
I ain't reading what you wrote because it has 0 to do with classic wow. And I dont care about your feelings. Same with OP
---
Fuck it just throw your life away like the rest of us already
---
Didn’t call him racist, looks like you have a guilty conscience 🧐
---
Yeah the chat invite was never a part of Vanilla and you had to /join *channel name* back then. Which is why saying no changes is ironic, as having this in the first place is a change. People seem very serious about it judging by the downvotes im getting tho lol.
---
Yeah I just did Uldaman up until the last boss as a party of 42's - 43's. I'll wait until 44 before retrying.
---
Maybe, also maybe you care too much about what other people care about that they shouldn't care about, even if they don't care and are making a funny post?
---
You can be dodged from behind.
---
At 30 as a priest you can just start healing SM runs.  You can sail through to 40 pretty easily there.  
---
Hunter is great.  I'm biased though.  They won't start to fall off in raid content until Phase 5, which we don't know when that will be released, but we can assume you have quite some time.  Even so, that's just end-game raiding.  There's still PvP which hunters excel at.
---
dunno. noone tolds me why, well the first one said he will send my case to "investigation" but the other one just  said they took a decision and he wont answer nothing else to me. lol
---
You don’t want daggers when you’re playing hemo. You want 2 very slow weapons
---
Well yeah, as long as I'm the one calling the shots it is
---
Join a guild, world or LFG chat and you will see it constantly.
---
I did this one time. ONCE! Posted a picture of my screen that i took with my phone just before a raid when we were all gathered in SW waiting to pop Ony buff. Mannnnnnnn the triggered-REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE'S that followed on Reddit were unbearable lmao
---
&gt;That's why Blizzard has changed classes over the years so that you have multiple options for any particular buff/ability.
---
To play devil's advocate, and I think FFXIV kinda taught me this. I don't think a buff is a good way to demonstrate class specialness. Its kinda a copout. 
---
I'm all for the iconic class buffs, but I think if we're deciding if a certain era of class design meets the standard, we should disregard class buffs when comparing.
---
I refuse to believe it, his post history is too tame for that level of shenanigans
---
Wait till lvl 26 when you get cone of cold to aoe
---
damn thats a lot, hope my serv will still be healthy with less hardcore people.
---
You can roll engineering for that pocket knife thing too unless im getting that mixed up. It would let you shock someone back to life and only failed like 90% of the time.
---
I was thinking the same thing. They think they're all big and bad but wait until you're half life fighting 2 mobs at the same time to attack. Weak sauce
---
Meanwhile my server, Pagle, isn't even on his list. SMDH
---
&gt; People have literally been doing all the things you mentioned for the past 15 years on private servers and there’s still an obvious demand for it.
---
Private servers that kept relaunching.
---
&gt;Well, you get to the top by being dedicated.
---
And lucky. Proof, go to any illegal migrant farmer camp. You'll never see more hard working people then the shanty town behind a dairy farm. Those dudes never make anything liek the Top
---
Yea, a lot of these "omgsoeasy" people are going to shit a brick the first time they hit Loatheb.
---
I'm also assuming C'Thun is fixed so he's actually killable.
---
People forget how much more powerful player characters are now, and just how drastically the game changed mechanics wise during WoW's earlier days. Taunts work radically different, debuffs work radically different, talents changed dramatically, abilities changed dramatically, mana regen changed, consumables changed (try to beat Loatheb using only 1 potion, I dare you), and that's not even getting to things that changed on the backend like damage tick calculations, debuff slot increases, etc. Add on top of that technology limitations from most people being on dial up and toasters...
---
People forget a lot of the challenge in vanilla wasn't the boss mechanics as much as it was overall design, engineering, and technological limitations. Most boss fights were fairly simple.
---
They were also very punishing of mistakes or unfortunate accidents (like an ill timed DC).
---
By 1.12, a lot of the design and engineering issues had been solved or at least mitigated, which drastically reduced the challenge of a lot of things.
---
If its red,it's dead! For Ironforge!
---
Just imagine if he took his character safety completely serious, and rp-walked around, instead of running.
---
You could install Auctioneer and it will let you know if it would be more beneficial to vendor, AH or disenchant an item.
---
This legit made me laugh out loud at work due to how painfully accurate it is.
---
It's nuts the game is out for 2 weeks and people are already selling gold
---
I always charge in when someone is in danger. Get to hit more stuff with my big axe and help someone not die. Why wait for max level to do what we signed up to do
---
For the Trickster, mocking blows kind of gives the rogue the opposite of what they'd normally want. Maybe something like "Ventriloquism" or "throw your voice" acts as a taunt, but affects the aggro level of the target's current target.
---
So if the tank is in danger of losing threat to DPS / healers, that would help him retain threat a bit longer. That would also be directly beneficial to the rogue as they could go all out for longer without worrying about pulling threat.
---
Did you even read my comment? I didn’t say don’t complain when they add bad changes, I’m saying I dislike when players jump the gun on them before we have an official announcement on whether it is a bug or not.

OP's character in their underwear, I guess? 🤷
---
For anyone who doesn't know this, if you send the spammer a whisper you can then right click their name and report them.
---
He's never seen a sunrise, at least not the way we see them.
---
create a channel called Fuck You, create macro that invites the spam bot by name, and spam it :p
---
Wont accomplish anything but might make you feel better
---
The bots will always find a way
---
Blizzard also needs to make the ignore list for each player larger.  I think I have like 100 of these players blocked, and it said it was full.  WTF?
---
Level 12 warrior hanging around hogger helping people with the quest. Felt good to help out and not worry about leveling.
---
'Lonewolf' for Hunter sounds really cool! Sometimes my pet gives away my position a lot or is not needed in some situations. Be nice to have a benefit to traveling without a pet.
---
Come to rattlegore, my guild is called bone zugs ‘n harmony
---
Yes, there is nothing wrong about growing a community where everyone knows each other by name, but that will happen on any server. If you have played classic before once layering is removed, anyone who is worth knowing is generally known. 
---
On the topic of people moving, I get that they moved because they want to play, I am just saying that its a higher likely hood of them quitting. Does not mean they will. Most of vanilla is a huge grind/planning, and if you cant wait through que most likely they wont last. Its just a generalization.
---
And I get that you are trying to get people to move to grow the server, I am just **trying to warn** those who do not know what its like to be on an **empty server**, also to help them consider what will happen in the future. The server will die, it will be a long time before blizzard does anything, and unless you want to play with a small group of people, do not transfer.
---
And being free is not a reason to do something.
---
TBH I won't miss her.
---
Are you the shaman that needed on Kresh?
---
You want an entire party or raid to run through the mob being attacked TOWARDS possible adds in the dungeon so that the tank doesnt need to hit a couple keys to rotate the mob???  JFC as a tank myself, i am begging you to please never tank.
---
You should be able to get red of that with whatever addon you have for configuring your action bars. I'm just using Bartender, which lets you move/hide the majority of the default UI.
---
" 90% of that content requires no actual communication or teamwork. "
---
So you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
LFR isn't what they balance around. Its Mythic Raids.
---
Mythic raids require Discord, pretty much most if not all ranked BGs require comms. High rated Arena players want comms, M+ needs SERIOUS teamwork or you arent pushing a key.
---
Ally scum!
---
Still spamming trade
---
They don't have to use the key, if the person can't reach it solo (Which is most chests in Classic level 60 dungeons) then why are they allowed solo rights to the loot?
---
Had a warrior get pissed in SM library last night because I rolled in the staff at the end and won.
---
None of those things are benefits of being ret. They're just regular paladin abilities. Any other spec can do them just as well.
---
I checked the forums and apparently a few other people have made posts complaining about it too, so we aren't crazy. Hoping Blizzard will notice any of the posts so it get's worked on. I have no idea if the bug can effect PvP and it would be a pretty huge deal if so.
---
Took me 8 days of game played for 60, 300 LW, 300 FA, 300 lockpicking. But it was worth it! I would hope fellow rogues push through and continue the class. Although I will admit I did have drifting thoughts about rolling a mage lol.
---
I think they are trying to get there, and hoping people will take advantage of free transfers to do so. But people are even less incentivized now to switch than they were last week. In the meantime several servers would implode if you removed layers altogether immediately.
---
you didnt get it
---
Great idea, thanks!
---
How'd you pull that off this early on such a low level? Is the chest not camped like crazy?
---
Yeah let's stop using two features of the game because of spammers instead of implementing a simple button to have easier access to the report system.
---
You's a genius!
---
You should do it earlier to make people trying to board miss the boat cuz they fell and have to swim back. 
---
But I'm a chaotic natural so.....
---
No bloodlust in classic
---
Interesting thought. I logged into Herod last night and found that there was a queue of over 4k. I didn't stick around to see how fast it was moving but the estimated time was over an hour. Different strokes for different folks I guess.
---
Wallpaper worthy.
---
Got a higher res available?
---
Find a new raid leader. This toxic crap can take a hike.
---
I get them roughly half my sessions, with never more than 2 in the ones I did. It's still annoying, but people are overblowing it. Let's just be happy gold sellers are advertising in a way that's easily preventable with no reproductions. There is no way to stop them, just let them have this.
---
This isn’t a Blizzard issue, it’s a VPN issue.
---
I'm a guild name now, dope
---
I buff everyone with water breathing, in hopes they give me useful buffs lol.
---
maybe gnome was just going to BRD, fastest is to jump into magma and swim, you take like 2 ticks of dmg so like 20% of your health bar
---
That would explain the str on cloth quest rewards
---
Double woosh?
---
He is saying I give you gold in BFA, you give me gold in classic.
---
No there is a second background reroll in cases of ties.
---
I have leveled a hunter 4 times in vanilla + pservers, and I guarantee you you will be meleeing a lot.
---
This and you can use clique to bind things to your mouse
---
Okay grab your tinfoil hats and hear me out
---
HE SAID IT WASN’T IN VANILLA!!!
---
Thanks for responding. This right here for sure is it. I think people that see MC on farm etc will realize bwl+ does step it up and I know naxx for the time was insane to get 40 people on the same page has always been the issue as well
---
Would be more impressive to survive the rampaging orcs and trolls too
---
Yeah everyone's done it
---
Maybe you look cheap
---
I can shitpost something in like 30 seconds
---
Uh what? lmao
---
Obviously you haven't put in the time to work towards higher level fractals.
---
Or Rift end game raiding at that.
---
5 in shadow focus is largely unnecessary while leveling though. 2 points sets you at hit cap against a creature of same level. If you put a third point, you're at hit cap for two levels above.
---
I would highly recommend Kromkrush.  It was one of the servers that was opened on launch day to reduce queues.
---
It is an East Coast server and the population is great.  I normally log on anywhere between 6-8 PM EST.  There is sometimes a queue but the longest I've had to wait over the past week and a half is 15 minutes.
---
bUt rOgUeS cAnT aOe fArM SM!!!
---
Well, did you punt, or what?
---
Not a bug really. Your bnet friends and server friends will show up there. I think there are addons that clean it up, but not sure.
---
I like to roll em early for extra storage, and also if I get bored I can hop on my alt and have a change of scene. Everyone does it differently though.
---
Some people may tell you that you don't need to finish all the quests in a zone before moving on, but I honestly think you should try and do so, especially as a warrior. 
---
Warriors are the hardest to level in classic in my opinion and benefit a lot from being a few levels ahead of a zone prior to entering it. 
---
I actually complete all quests in all zones in a level range before moving onto another level range. For example, I would do all the quests in Durotar, Mulgore, and Tirisfal Glades and instead of entering the Barrens/Silverpine Forest at level 10-12, I'm entering at around 14-15. This may be overkill, however, so I would leave that up to you if you want to do that.
---
As a warrior, you want to prioritize strength and stamina. Attack power is also good, but kind of rare at lower levels. Spirit and agility have their benefits as a warrior too, but I usually wouldn't take them over strength or stamina. Spell power and intellect are the main stats that I think you'll find no value in.
---
Do you have any other questions I could help you with?
---
I always thought first to roll got it in a tie. Guess not!
---
When people talk about tuning something in gaming, its talking about balance. In tuning something in league isn't changing league from a multiplayer game to single player, its balancing something.
---
This is common knowledge.
---
Good to know, thank you
---
Can't control that im pretty sure, but it was to be assumed if you ever played retail since the tokens introduction , a part of you knew it would adapt to classic economy and if there are wisers then dev's ..its the players lol
---
We DAnT WanT aNi chAnguS to ClAzIcK
---
And has backup. Speaking from experience.
---
Does this work while you're killing the mobs in front of said chest? I've had this happen twice, but I was always in combat while they were stealing it.
---
How can I be more effective at aoe leveling as a frost mage? I haven't really speced for it, instead putting points into ice shards. I'm at level 25 and blizzard feels like a fairly ineffective aoe right now. It does not do very much damage for the mana that it costs. Maybe I'm doing it wrong?
---
Leatherworkers can craft it into higher quality leather.
---
Very Lore accurate.
---
Honestly I don't expect a mage to portal everyone if they do I throw them a reagent tip. Thats going far above and beyond what you're asked. I had a mage do it one time, and it was an OH hell ya, and had to run back to use the portal since I was running out the instance.
---
Can confirm. Was fishing for deviate fish when got facerolled by a group of Alliance. If they didnt have a healer I would have taken a few of em with me.
---
I am OG player always been Horde always a healer ( I have alts but always main priest) then and now I have lvl'd holy. This post gives me the feels and pride as a fellow priest (we just gonna set aside the factions right now) claims victory for our kind! Huzzah!
---
Yeah, that’s why I mentioned the possibility off add ons. I have my reasons for suspecting botting. For example I posted something cheap and it was instantaneously bought by the AH guy, then I posted a non related mat for cheap and again, instant buyout. One was ore and one was cloth. So unless there is an addon that can have multiple pages up, constantly refreshing, something is fishy
---
That would be the absolute worst way they could break ties.
---
Cringe
---
I'm here to talk about WoW not your feelings. Wont be reading anything you right unless it has to do with WoW. So if you wanna rewrite that into something about WoW I'd love to chat about it. Just not your feelings
---
&gt; It's not hard, its time consuming.
---
All of Classic summed up in 6 words.
---
In my experience it is not possible for warriors to consistently maintain aggro on large packs of mobs when using blizzard. She can help when in the world by rounding the mobs up so you have little risk when going in for the initial nova and she can assist in aoe damage to clear packs a little faster but you will be the one kiting. 
---
This makes sense because again your threat is so large that trying to top you is unlikely and would waste time on her part and because you are in the least danger being the furthest away while the mobs are slowed. You can pick whatever talents you like but the only mandatory picks are 3/3 permafrost and 2/3 imp blizz. Going 3/3 imp blizz means you cannot overwrite the slow with cone of cold but provided you don't drop the chill debuff it offers very good control.
---
1g is the norm.
---
Yeah, I wont do it to an ally
---
Yes. Macros work best with the exact name of spells and items shift clicked. It's a long running quirk
---
I've literally never wanted/needed to be invited to a channel, by anyone, ever, for any legitimate purpose.
---
Um.. that's exactly the point?
---
I was 12 years old when I played classic. I had a 60 Priest and a 60 Rogue. The priest was my first 60 because I saw a Priest with Benediction and thought it was the coolest looking thing. I saw Rogues doing infinite stunlocks and thought it was the coolest looking thing. I saw Warlocks releasing huge demons that murdered absolutely everybody, and thought it was the coolest looking thing.
---
I'm living my 12 year old fantasy. Is that OK with you?
---
I saw some asshole ninja a chest as people were rolling on it. He quickly got called out in gen chat.
---
I'm by no means an expert but you may need to be BM spec to have unique pets?
---
I wish people who played in vanilla had some sort of pet or title, then we could shut those people up.
---
Have you played hunter a lot?
---
Tbc killed the game for you but it was still your favourite?  Surely it being your favourite means it didn't kill the game for you, it made it better?
---
The difference is that using WoW token is not illegal.
---
Level 17 Orc Warlock, and I just started Enchanting. Google search shows that tailoring is best to do with it. However, none of the guides say exactly WHY. I'm curious as to how they both compliment each other? Wouldn't I be better off with mining or skinning as a way to make money?
---
My heart wouldn't be in to it. Id be thinking about how I'm going to level my professions, check my auctions,  pick up some quests, and work toward the wirlwind axe the second I'm done with this needy woman.
---
Yeah..... see that's the thing. Realistically for most people, asking them to save 60% of their income is ludicrous. You have to be making 70,75K a year for that to be even feasible. Most americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Saving even $500 is an achievement. I've been following FI for a couple years now, reading all the comments, and across the board the people in that subreddit who achieve it are all on the extreme far end of the bell curve for income. Most of that subreddit wouldn't understand how much it costs to be poor.
---
If flying detracts from the world, that is a design flaw. FFXIV handles flying perfectly fine. Although there is no wpvp, but according to you, that is a minor thing so it doesn't matter.
---
Only got ganked once in Shimmering Flats for the entire time I quested there.
---
Now that was something special. STV later today.
---
It is a dps increase if you go shatter?
---
Lmao 😂 1-0 fenald
---
The devs confirmed it was a hidden second roll that decides it.
---
Saw a video on Reddit (yesterday?) Of a guy playing during extreme turbulence. He said the latency was pretty bad but he was still able to grind about half a level (in a 10 hour plus flight)
---
I’d accept
---
&gt; what people have been doing is buying a WoW token (real money)
---
ok
---
&gt; selling in on the AH for BfA gold
---
&gt; and then trading that gold in exchange for gold in Classic.
---
lol wut?
---
I’ve tried skilling and leatherworking together, and in my opinion its better to vendor your leather. You have too much competition for your goods, and your leather is more valuable as leather than as armor. Crafting professions are a time and money sink you may be better off waiting till 60 to start
---
Underrated meme
---
I'd argue that my previous post contained more opinion than feelings and that yours was more emotionally charged
---
Yeah going from Loch Modan to Wetlands is hell. Got ganked 3 times from ?? level Horde with backup.
---
Wrath, I think. Jewelcrafting was in BC, Inscription was Wrath.
---
Yep, the hardest part about classic is fighting to get the tag on mobs.
---
Unless their name is gƍldƌƏƒƓsƎllƐr™. I've seen people with unicode symbols in their names :(
---
Not an add-on. Just right click the frames, press unlock and then move them
---
I have nothing against the quest being in the game, I just don’t think the omission of the quest is strange
---
Healing them also brings them into combat if youre still fighting.
---
Rofl. Let those people do it. They are getting ripped off hard because gold will be super cheap in a couple months
---
Gun paladin sign me up
---
I take it you were never an officer in a guild. We used em for class leaders and officers for 40 man raiding.
---
You clearly don't understand how many people are on each layer.
---
You must be new to this game.  Most specs are not raid viable.
---
Just because you have damage spells or abilities doesn't mean you are doing viable damage
---
I have the same problem with my warlock using max rank rain of fire.  I can wait for the mobs to get to 50% health and do nothing.  Then I cast 16 seconds of aoe and the mobs that were slowest to die want to pick my brains out from my skull.
---
You can disenchant the tailoring items you make to get enchanting mats
---
people in this thread: if your class cant aoe farm its trash.
---
the same people: sit in SM for 20 levels then complain the game is trash.
---
GMs usually kicked the person within 15 minutes of being reported so it wasn't to bad.
---
LFG is the whole world afaik
---
What is your solution? Blizzard audit every single trade manually?
---
I'm not playing Classic, but seeing this city again gives me bad PTSD of knowing I'm about to be ganked to hell while fighting panthers.
---
meh. ive had to start over a few times once due to server issues and once to change faction.  games been out for two weeks its not like their closing it any time soon
---
Idk what to tell you, because I literally did it. But keep down voting someone who literally did it.
---
Because the new models weren't in classic.
---
Wait, so its intended if i open my wow friendlist im seeing all those guys playing hearthstone overwatch or whatever instead of my actual wow friends? this seems incredibly dumb
---
I spawned echeyakee in the barrens with my on use quest item that disappears after, while I was standing there bandaging before pulling a warlock comes and steals the tag and then says "smd" and runs off, why even play an MMO if your that anti social..
---
I have had this interaction happen as well so idk
---
Oh shit, yeah. I got mine somewhere in my room as well!
---
Since I’m a Tauren I doubt the vendor in Elwynn would be willing to sell one to me haha. Do you know what mobs drop it or what the cat pet is called so I can google it? Thank you so much! My cow needs a pet cat
---
Lol I still remember the velcro attached to the back of the box cover. And I think I was disappointed, because it blocked some of the artwork. This was in 2005, so I could be misremembering
---
Beautiful. I didn't know you wouldn't aggro the bruisers for this. Totally doing this (as an alliance rogue, to balance you out) when I login later.
---
You mean "find a bad raid that won't last long because the raid leader doesn't know what he is doing"
---
wow that is brutal. when i did my quest I wondered if the item was lootable. turns out it is.
---
They were also originally going to be leather wearers
---
Step one, get a skullflame shield. Step two, get the green box from sunken temple. Step three, shield spike on shield. Step four, profit.
---
&gt;as soon as they are full health and mana they come fighting  
---
So fight them then instead of while they're minding their own business. What's the problem.
---
At this exact point (or after the question is posted), are Linux users still needing to do something in order to connect? I was lurking around a bit and heard that the DDOS mitigation blocks TTL that isn't some expected value from Windows (and I assume macOS) or something like that.
---
How is this done?
---
Timing SS only matters (really) after you get 5/5 swordspec.
---
Anyone got a link for a HQ version of the class symbols?
---
Just report who you see. That’s all you can do. People will always have weird names and reporting increases the chances of it being changed. I think after a couple months people will start having more RP names as the economy and the server kind of settles down.
---
Do you have an auction addon that scans the AH, like auctionator? If so, scan the AH whenever you go to it. Also, get a vendor price addon. They should put the average AH price and the average vendor price in the tooltip. 
---
If the AH price + posting price is lower than or equal to the vendor price, vendor. 
---
If the AH price - posting price is greater than the vendor price, auction. If you don't sell after 2-3 auctions, vendor.
---
If there is no know AH price, search the AH for similar items, add 20% or so to those prices, and use that as the AH price.
---
Generally, cloth with strength/agility and no spirit/intelligence will not sell so just vendor those. Leather and Mail with agility or intelligence has a higher likelyhood of selling. Plate with intelligence on Horde will not sell.
---
I'm using GatherMate2 8.0.2 (or whatever the latest retail version is) in Classic just fine. Have to check "Load out of date addons".
---
There's usually a LFG channel. Self explanatory.
---
Wow, thanks so much for your input!
---
I said work hard.
---
Seems like a boring PvP server if you ask me. 🙂
---
You still get the message saying "you blocked a chat channel invite from so-and-so for channel www.goldspambullshit.com" though.
---
It's no longer a pop-up you have to click out of but even the messages irritate me.
---
I don't think there is an option to disable showing [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) friends in-game. But you can turn off all [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) notifications, so the only time you'll see your [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) friends is when you open your friends list.
---
As for why Blizzard decided to do this, I can't say myself.
---
I think you meant to post this on /r/wow
---
Man, as with every conversation about +healing there's a ton of misinformation from people who pretty clearly haven't done the math, don't actually play healers, or don't know what they are talking about.
---
**You don't need to do any downranking till well after 40.**
---
Often I don't even really fuck with it except for maybe *a* downranked heal that I'll occasionally throw out to people who aren't the tank.
---
* Healing is about efficiency. There are two things you should do to be more efficient: Spend more time recovering mana (not casting spells), and cast spells with better HP per mana
---
* Max rank heals do both of those things better. They have better HP/mana ratios than the lower ranks. They heal for more, meaning you can not heal for longer.
---
* The only time this is different is when you have large amounts of +healing and MP5. Then, it doesn't matter as much if you burst heal/recover, and you get better efficiency out of lower ranked spells. This won't be an issue until you are *very geared* and actually in a healing spec.
---
* As a result, the only time you should downrank while leveling is to prevent overhealing. That's pretty much it.
---
Thats no eye of kilrogg
---
Yet there has been posts about people needing a name change due to being reported on an RP server.
---
You can make alts with tailoring as well.
---
Sorry, didn't know this was twitter.  I thought this was the classic wow subreddit: a place to talk about classic wow and our experiences in it.  Next time I'll just post the hundredth low-effort "how to take a screenshot" meme.  I apologize for my confusion.
---
What are the overall themes of elemental and tribal leatherworking?
---
Lmaooo gotcha, thanks for the advice! Knew that about cloth and i usually either roll freed (if everyone else has) or pass to give others a better chance. Especially right now at lower levels cause i know every piece of gear matters right now.
---
Don't be that guy. Let people enjoy the game.
---
I'm up to about 40 now and the rotation is pretty much the same. Opener -&gt; SnD -&gt; SS -&gt; Bladefury -&gt; SS -&gt; SnD Maintenance
---
This guy (or gal) groups
---
Willing to bet you want need rolls on all boe rares too because you can sell on the ah
---
^
---
&gt;That's not a thing it was probably your video cards software or you were playing rift.
---
I am confident that was not the case. It was an optional key bind within the WoW interface.
---
As a totally not interested in world pvp guy I play on a PVE server. I take pride in assisting anyone I see in trouble by throwing in a fear or some dots to help another with low health. 
---
I did some questing in barrens as alliance and the horde I ran into were more polite in terms of not trying to steal my upcoming mob tag than most alliance. 
---
I’m glad people enjoy world pvp but I’m even more glad it’s optional.
---
Just yesterday I got to cast Water Breathing on a group that was doing some quest where they were diving for shit - felt good.
---
Just some the guides I have watched stating that warriors get a lot crit for agil made me wonder if it was worth the trade off
---
There are over 26,000 people online on my server at peak times for the Alliance.
---
I want to keep layering.
---
The amount of people who spend their time complaining about complaining about such a trivial thing is too damn high
---
Hang on! That's not a vanilla gnome!
---
Unfortunately you have no idea how many times he will run it in the future and if he ever wins a roll on it again. You dont get to decide when someone is allowed to roll on an item they can use.
---
What if he plays 18 hours a day and can use it tomorrow, vs someone who plays a few hours a week and is only 1 level away from equipping it?
---
I'm reading, but apparently you think the need option applies to greed as well while I think the need option is for people who need the item.
---
It doesn't drop 500g it drops an item. If you think cash goes before gear then that's on you. But to deny that it's greedy is delusional.
---
I feel ya man, there’s nothing worse than when you try to set up a pull on some mobs and the hunters pet runs past you and wipes.
---
Yes it is
---
You can bind them in the normal keybinding settings. However you can also macro them, I just don't know the syntax offhand.
---
I think you're in the wrong sub.  This looks more like the retail talents where each spec is almost like its own subclass.  In vanilla, specs arent as much of a thing since you often get talents from all 3 talent trees.
---
Why not both?
---
You can do all 3 with one class and then some. Your playing a druid for the utility, not the pureness of tanking, DPS or heals that those other three have. No other class can heal and then panic off tank if the main tank dies, live through the encounter and continue on without a wipe. Gets more interesting with raiding, potentially tanking some fights and healing others. It's cool to switch things up every now and then.
---
No, you just want to think that
---
Guess we found the retard
---
Is the Tanaris coast not bugged for you at all?  I get empty loot windows when I fish there, but that hasn't happened anywhere else.  Really weird.
---
You are the best kind of mage (: thank you
---
grobbulus here as well (:
---
Still BoW is probably the bet one in the leveling zone. That Mp5 is really noticable on hunters, priests and mages.
---
Yeah, no thanks. I already have to wait on respawns and fight to tag quest mobs on Herod. It would be unplayable with 5x as many people competing.
---
The one that vendors highest

then they realized later on they should lower the level. it is nice however playing the original version. i started after the burning crusades. I am intimidated and excited for when i can get my mount. 
---
also, laziness and low effort for the win.
---
I dunno man, I'm the sort of guy that if I loot something and theres someone else in the party that wants it for something genuine like a profession scheme or it's better than their current slot item, I couldn't care less even if it sells on the ah for a but load. If I dont need it for anything but they do, then in sure as hell going to give them that item because I'm not a dick
---
I used to pwshield on dps warriors who were close to pulling threat off the tank.

I need to try this

I've been trying to figure out how to block this.

Trade skill master or monitor or something else that starts with m.

The standard combat dagger build is fine for pvp, imp sprint will help you against most classes and prevent you from getting kited whilst still being able to burst down more tanky targets as well with Adrenaline Rush. However when you don’t have your cds you’re pretty much fucked, but that can be said for most rogue speccs.

but but but MUH IMMERSION
---
the answer is yes
---
Thank you for the first time heal then (:
---
I'll certainly look into it! I don't play with reliance on my 2-hander as is, I utilize shocks when needed (Flame on Rogues, Earth to interrupt, Frost to chase or kite) as well as Heal while Immobilized if need be, otherwise Lightning Bolt.

I have a build I drew up that was oriented around 2-handers, but also has some good Ele points for Shocks, I'm interested to see if the talent trees compare.
---
Thanks for the reference!
---
It was actually about 13, and I bought four 6 slot bags, so I think add another 25s on there! Biggest thing is not ranking up every skill. More bag space also means less grey loot you have to pass on when out questing.
---
Just vendor light/heavy leather. Once you get Thick leather, start AH'ing it.
---
Wow
---
People are gonna join and people are gonna buy, even if one person does it a week, these “companies” are gonna continue.  It’s like why you still see ‘meet local singles’ type ads for decades.. people are clicking that shit
---
Yeah, for now. The game just was launched, you will feel differently 2-3 months from now.
---
It's your level 40 mount (90g) you need to start saving for.
---
I feel like I’m going crazy because I can’t find a single resource for it online—my friends and I used to use a climb into a specific jump to get over the undercity wall as a shortcut to Scarlet Monastery. Does ANYONE remember this? Is it still possible? Did it require a mount? Have I simply lost my mind?
---
Rogue leveling is a bit dry unless you have a group and can go dual daggers. With combat swords, your rotation really is Stealth -&gt; Garrote -&gt; Sinister Strike x# -&gt; Slice and Dice -&gt; Rinse and Repeat. Squeeze in Rupture for armored targets or Evisc for damage. 
---
The early levels do feel pretty dry for a lot of classes though, you're often missing your best abilities/talents until 30-40. You'll feel a lot beefier once you get poisons + blade flurry.
---
Rogue gets most of their dmg from auto-attacks.
---
It's very much stealth -&gt; garrotte, sinster -&gt; evis spam
---
In raiding you need to keep up SnD and if you are min-maxing watch swing timers to SS only after melee hitting to avoid clipping sword procs.
---
Assuming you are playing the standard combat sword build.
---
That said, it's the same as most other classes, mage literally only uses frostbolt for the entire first 2 tiers.
---
Rip reserving a name with symbols in it
---
Lack of groups.  I like to group alot.  People seems to want hunter and mages for dps.  Mostly mages as to not complete for loot I think.
---
So I rerolled a more group friendly class.
---
As far a I know even today that's not a feature in retail and it definitely 100% no room for error was not a feature during bc and wotlk.
---
There's 👏 nothing 👏 wrong 👏 with 👏 using 👏 HD 👏 water
---
Please hide gold spammer url's so you don't put their shitty website on the frontpage of reddit, this is exactly what they want.
---
You dont have to be a retard because you play on a roleplaying server.
---
Grow up
---
Totally agree. About 90% of the people I've talked to in Vanilla has been extremely friendly and nice. I am very proud that this community managed to pull this off. 
---
A thank you to those people!
---
You're an idiot, and no one should listen to your advice. Idgaf if you stumbled through hunter 4 times with 10+ days /played. You have zero clue what you are talking about; at most you should be using melee to kite; not sitting in melee whacking it like you're a fucking paladin or something.
---
&gt; beachfront property in Nevada
---
Tahoe?
---
Put on friendly name plates and click those!  It helps when there are people nearby NPCs that you need to talk to
---
what are you talking about, the abilities would be available to anyone of that class, the talents you would have to chose and spec into, I broke them into two sections so you could see which goes where
---
Lol, says a paladin.
---
-divine shield
---
-hearthstone
---
I've been casting it on people, regardless of location or usefulness - it has been amusing.
---
so serious lmao
---
Seriously, I've played on RP servers since '04, '99 if you count EQ, and I die inside when I see people argue for IC chat in global channels.
---
There is no magical telepathic global chat network that we can tap into, IC.
---
The visual of your classic character model is way, way, way more critical to the classic experience. Super disorienting to see the much more animated models in the classic wow world - just doesn't fit.
---
I reported a guy that invited me last night that did this. In my report messages I suggest that blizz write up a way to scan for lvl ones creating channels with 'www' in the channel name. Seems like a very specific use case where that'd happen.
---
If they could target gold farmers the queue issue would be reduced some.
---
I only get any thanks when I rez someone
---
Thanks for this. I was getting fucked by “skull” level horde gankers yesterday while I was trying to quest, and a priest came by and resurrected me and healed me back up. I felt like she was telling me “it’s going to be ok champ, you got this” while she picked me up and dusted me off. Felt kinda nice.
---
The square looks like an Ice Cube, and the moon means sleep, like counting sheep. Voila.
---
Good to hear! Thanks!
---
Found Rolf’s remains but I don’t have the next step which is report to Thomas. When I go to Guard Thomas I don’t have a quest step. Bug?
---
I raided religiously from 04-06. We wouldn't even let a feral druid in the group, period. You were either resto or you didn't get invited. I don't think it was considered viable over other dps or tank slots until at least TBC. I think *maybe* we started using a bear tank in AQ. How much shit has changed since then is beyond me and, since it took multiple months for the first rag kill on my server compared to 1.5 weeks this time, it's probably going to be substantially different so who knows.
---
This is a great tip! Plus they usually have armor 
---
Which means more survivability for them :D
---
and I said it's not hard. How do you work hard leveling lp? It's time consuming. You don't have to put much or any effort into leveling it, so how does one work hard to do it. Even getting to 60 you don't have to work hard to do it.
---
&gt;People are loving class uniqueness rather than a complex class
---
That uniqueness will eventually fade away when they realize that only a handful of classes with cookie cutter talent builds actually matter. Everything else is either irrelevant or just gets a raid invite to buff someone else who is actually doing something meaningful.
---
I generally agree here. It wasn't just it looking ugly, but it just *felt* off. It didn't have that signature WoW crisp-ness.
---
Running animations didn't quite line up with your movement, casts/abilities didn't feel quite as responsive, all that stuff just led to it feeling not quite right.
---
Combine that with the choice to go for a realistic graphics style that aged poorly and ran like ass on basically every computer, the generally uninspiring races/world/etc, it all didn't help.
---
A true shame, because the game design behind RIFT was basically the WoW model done to perfection, just held back by the technical and art aspects.
---
I'm on Skeram and having lots of trouble in that level range too. Those ratios seem optimistic imho, I've felt it's probably more like 6:1. Going by /who results on other servers for STV during off hours, I think it's probably around that ratio.
---
My biggest problems have been with other Alliance players seemingly hating PVP. Just had an infuriating encounter yesterday where a 45 Horde and 2 45 Alliance players were questing on an island. I /wave at the horde, he /no's me, I /question, he kills me. Come back, he kills me again. Whisper one of the 2 alliance players asking for help, they say 'idk he seemed friendly'. Yeah no shit, you'd destroy him. 🙄
---
Then the horde player attacked another ~35 ally trying to quest as well, so I just gave up. Why even roll on a PVP server if you're that against PVP?
---
Anyhow, thank you for coming to my ted talk.
---
Everything is bound, powershifting, Cat to bear etc. Just feels like shit and is a pain in the ass for no real gain.
---
And druid leveling was fast as fuck, guess if you sit in form it's slow, but that seems ineffective.
---
Lots of pain, for no gain.
---
Memes so old they weren't called memes.
---
Lol we call our mage Bobby Boucher.
---
Linen is worthless on my server.  When theres 800+ of an item on the AH it's no longer worth putting up there.
---
That isn't nitpicking. I was using the correct wording, the other person didn't and kept trying to move the goal posts. Showing that even in reference to diablo and WoW its what I said it is isn't nitpicking.
---
Blacksmithing trinket.
---
I lucked out and won elemental mage staff in my lbrs group and I insta equipped that shit lol

What's better for a priest at lvl 34?

&gt; Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 11.
---
I’m just poking fun but it’s literally the first sentence of the post lol.
---
Ooooo, I should start charging people for using my weapon and defense skills while tanking.
---
Or even just when dipshit dps pull a bunch of stuff that I wasn't ready for, causing me massive repair bills trying to keep their idiot selves alive.
---
You can enter combat with an aggressive mob in multiple ways, group mob aggro, etc. the most common way is he originally got run at by that mob, you took tag, and he stayed in combat until either you or the mob dies, or he leashes distance. 
---
Your anecdotal evidence is once again still incorrect. 
---
Just because you don’t understand something doesn’t mean that it’s wrong. You MUST be in combat to fail a chest loot. I have looted chests out of combat with mobs literally inside of me smacking someone else. The looting rules are public and well known. Just because you misperceived something doesn’t make it a bug.
---
You said pay their completely red plate repair cost.
---
Gotcha. Yeah, I don't see this feature anymore in Retail/Classic, which sucks, because it was so convenient.
---
ok not quite the same
---
Some people are just happy and want to share their happiness and enjoyment of wowclassic.
---
Lmao, you were the rogue with the priest. Cute story you made.
---
Do i have to learn a skill to mine tin?  If so, i feel like an idiot lol.
---
Yes. Gold farmers are Chinese. China has very strict censorship rules about certain topics and people there are conditioned to avoid them.
---
I’ve had farmers log out or block me. One guy sent me a :(
---
Ranged paladin would be neat, but I saw another suggestion for a Lancer spec for mounted combat and now I can't get behind anything else.
---
As a druid, I would totally be down for a "lord of the forests" build revolving around calling and managing animals/treants.
---
I need to hear the response to this one.
---
People unsolicited dueling are annoying. But if it's cross faction you can get them nuked pretty often by yeilding right as the duel starts. Do it near any argent Dawn, cenarians, or goblins and watch them get owned.
---
Is there a mod that can search the auction house for trade goods that are underpriced relative to the things I can convert them into with Tailoring and Cooking? I thought Auctioneer did this but it seemingly only handles disenchanting.
---
Druid healer here. Yes! Play a prot pally. Do it. I love healing you guys.
---
aoe farming is usually the term used when it's a mage doing it alone,  spell cleave when it's a group of mages/warlocks
---
Scan? Just use the camera on your phone to take a picture of the polaroid!
---
How else would you get filters on the faces?
---
That’s excellent advice! Thanks so much for the tip on gray item stacking
---
Not really, just stay logged in from your phone.
---
I think his point is visible enough to anyone who isn’t trying to be a smartass. He wants to be able to report these people and remove them from the game altogether rather than simply hiding them
---
Personally I don't think it is worth it. Run gnomer a few times and get thermapluggs arm. Use that until you can get bonebiter from the SM quest
---
Honestly it's not yours just because you saw it, or are fighting the last mob to get to it. It's yours if you take it, chest, or, escort quests, etc.
---
It doesn't make them a shitty person just because they got to it before you.
---
Is there any word on whether we're getting Hallow's End or other seasonal events in Classic?
---
Quote "I got" *woosh*
---
Let the economy stabilize first. Most people literally don't have gold to spare atm.
---
You need the helmet that gives rage and energy when transforming into  bear or cat. META. I bought it
---
Other people can see it.
---
Jaguars are pretty much a constant stream of leather and drop two 8s grey items. Was around 50g short farmed it in 6 hours or so.
---
Just going repost this yo you as I replied to another guy in here:
---
I just can't get along with that assessment. Does it work for hardcore player who see gold as equal value to progress as items for consumables and such? Yes of course.
---
BUT. For the playerbase at large its jarring and anti-thetical to the need/greed rolling system.
---
I believe for unity and good of gameplay elite players should take back bench and let expensive BOEs go to people who will equip or use them.
---
Its always a Warrior 3 or 4 levels under you that just Rambo charges as soon as hes in range. As a hunter I just trap them and continue questing and by the 3rd or 4th trap the usually move on to the next guy.
---
Learn something new everyday :)
---
I buff every one and their pets also. Buffs buffs all around.
---
Pvp auto attacks with the staff actually do decent damage on people, I cant xount the amount of times in vanilla when that extra few hundred damage made the difference. 
---
Also, it's pretty satisfying bopping someone on the head for a kill.
---
I think it's the time element.  In Classic WoW you appreciate the world because you have to spend so much time in it moving around, doing all the little tedious things.  
---
Even the type of questing is related to this--though there are a few that have too much running.  In modern games they neatly package everything up in little areas inside a zone, clumps of quests all at once.  You go to one little area, then the next, then the next.  There's no sense of open exploration, no sense the world is open and living because of this.  It's all conveniently wrapped into a linear progression with rails forcing you into one experience.
---
Generally speaking, I just put people with a retail attitude on ignore.
---
It’s called erring on the side of caution. Chastising people who are doing you a favor is inane.
---
It’s literally the middle of the day when everyone is at work or school.  No crap there aren’t any queues.  Make another video after dinner.
---
Did you try any of the macros on that site? I couldn't get any of the script macros to work but maybe I was doing it wrong.
---
Speaking of charge, whenever I'm with a tank I can't do it because he already pulled.
---
Fantastic production!
---
Do mobs really give less when they're higher? I was dead certain it was more.
---
&gt; I love the serenity and beauty of Classic
---
This is what i love the most about classic, you are just an adventurer without any urgency, just to explore and have fun.
---
Does screen snip work for WOW screenshots?
---
There are actually alot of quests in both, most are just really well hidden. If I remember correctly, each one of the cauldrons had at least one "hidden" quest around, telling small stories about what happened.
---
you won’t unfortunately, definitely not as powerful until after cataclysm.
---
4 mages doing ice block rotations. Other classes can pound sand.
---
If you actually read what I've been saying so far, you would have realised that the comparison stands on the original trilogy alone.
---
As a priest, people "take my mobs" all the time. I don't have any instant-damage spells, and my one instant cast is a DoT that takes 3 seconds to do its first tick of damage. Blizzard didn't introduce DoT-tagging until later.
---
Apart from that, priests typically "set up" their fights by casting shield right away, invoking the GCD. So if I'm standing and facing a mob directly in front of me while casting shield, there's a good chance I'm intending on killing that enemy, but there's plenty of time in my setup and damage casting for people to steal the mob from right out under my nose.
---
So unless I'm in a group and it's my party members getting the tags, I'm going to have a difficult time getting the kills I need in a decently populated area. And you can kiss named enemies goodbye. I parked myself by Kreenig Snarlsnout with a group for almost an hour, waiting for our turn to get the kill, and a bunch of dicks would come out of nowhere and tag him before us, then run away, waving at us.
---
I ran tier 4 fractals with my friend group (who I did CM/M+ server bests with) and we had literally no trouble because they're not nearly as challenging or innovative as the two MMOs I mentioned. They fall flat in terms of mechanical depth. The 10 man raids in GW2 were even easier than the tier 4 fractals, too.
---
You really shouldn't. Earthfury is a low pop server that will be dead in 1yr
---
As a general rule, open world PVP is never fair. The attackers either greatly outnumber the defenders, or they attack people when they are busy dealing with a multiple mob pull.
---
This is why I never roll on PVP servers. If I want to PVP, I can turn PVP on. Otherwise, I want to be left alone and not ganked by some higher level rogue while taking hits from several mobs. I can deal with a fair fight, but open world PVP is full of cowards and griefers most of the time.
---
A lot of people are at school/work right now, ya mong.
---
No thats super awesome, every once and awhile they'll hand me a few cloth scraps. I'd make sure you always had bubble and renew never below 80%
---
Thank you for liking it! &lt;3
---
Other people can see it, and i cant run in a straight line properly. My mount speed is sometimes more like walk speed the game is basically unplayable, so yeah i want to fix it.
---
I assume that is US as eu is rather full still all time
---
Pretty much.  There’s another section before you hit 165 where you can’t smelt anything for more xp and can only mine iron and Tin to progress.  It’s awful
---
I'm a level 56 resto druid main, From a healing perspective we're barely outclassed by priests and holy paladins but the big thing is that we dont have a traditional res, our only resurrect is a battle res with a 30 minute cooldown, so more often than not groups will specify that they only want a priest or paladin because someone dying and having to run back to the dungeon multiple times isn't efficient. More often than not  while levelling, you'll find yourself in slow farming groups because the spell/melee cleave comps never want a druid. Not saying that it's impossible to get into a group, but you'll get turned away alot by efficient farming groups when you're level 40+. Druid is a respectable healer and is viable throughout all of the game, but other classes are more forgiving in terms of accidents.  No one will laugh at you for tanking or healing on druid both specs are 100% viable through all content. if you go resto, try not to be discouraged when being declined from a group, as a bear tank you'll have 0 trouble finding groups, they perform their job very well. I would suggest going heavy in the feral tree and doing a cat/bear tank hybrid talent tree so you can quest quickly with cat form and find fast groups and reliably tank dungeons. On the classic.wowhead website you can find the hybrid talent tree i was talking about under the druid tank guide. Resto is no good for questing and you'll find yourself spamming dungeons for levels which can be kind of boring, and if you're sensitive like me being declined from groups all the time will make you sad lol. Hope i helped.
---
That's a lot of chat windows. I assume they are nested and not out on the screen.
---
I feel like your super salty about losing a roll. He won the item fair and square and your on reddit crying about it hours later. You are pathetic
---
I realize its your personal choice and you probably got enjoyment out of it but damn, farming a leveling dungeon for gear that gets replaced in 10 levels.. not for me.
---
Then buy them and vendor them...
---
Yes they are. Eye pulls
---
You're autistic
---
It’s the middle of the day. You really expect servers to be high/full at this time?
---
oh got ya. lol
---
I've never rolled on a PVE server.
---
PVP is fine and adds excitement. Even if you get ganked or camped it will just get you more motivated to level up and retaliate one day.
---
1:30 pm on a weekday
---
There's a lot of people new to classic who dont realize how valuable gold is yet.  I constantly see people advertising low level greens for over 1g.
---
Thanks for the clarification.  I can say that as a mage I'm thoroughly sick of AoE grinding - it's really only fun once you hit the zone with a good group and the XP flows like water.  It's actually kind of pathetic that everyone wants me in their dungeon groups until I say, "I'd like to do a full clear so I can get these quests completed".
---
Other community members have said THEY HAVE HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN. 
---
Why should I trust a mob on reddit, when the fucking community on this cite will circlejerk something thats blatantly wrong. Someone could say the Sky is a unicorn, and as long as they got gold or 10 upvotes, the entire community will spam upvote him and attack anyone correcting them.
---
Did that, didn't help. You can see it happening in ghost form here: [https://streamable.com/voy2l](https://streamable.com/voy2l)
---
Yes. We should be getting the classic versions. 
---
I cant find the blue post but i read they want those in. We also have a Holiday event going on right now.
---
Well let me show you the way to the graveyard for a nice run:
---
Not when I made my comments.
---
There is currently a seasonal event in the game, so that points towards yes!
---
It's soooo open-ended.  You can google around for average times of each dungeon.
---
But depends on group comp (experience, classes, gear, levels)  and the dungeon.
---
I would say no dungeon run is going to be under 30-45 minutes and even with afk breaks/etc. on second runs no dungeon has taken over 1.5 hours for me ever.  
---
Keep in mind you have to find a group, all get there, buff up, get food, etc.  Groups for dungeons 1-35 seem super easy to get still and Ive seen tons of level 40 running around.  So probably minimal wait time for a group unless you play on subpeak times.
---
That’s basically the definition of preference though. He prefers to level prot and he is clearly having fun. Not everyone needs or wants the most viable and optimal experience.
---
Yep. This is the truth.
---
Right, it's just time consuming
---
Yeah, for somethings. But if its for like herb resources or felcloth or whatever that will always be valuable, you now have access to 9x more of those resources than you will in a month, and that seems like a pretty safe bet to me.
---
I don't know exactly what the effect will be, as prices will organically increase anyways as people hit 60 etc as you said. But if you are hoarding now I am pretty sure its always a good investment that can't be replicated in a year, and will have a lasting effect (again don't know how big).
---
It's possible, but compared to warrior, playing a rogue was heaven. So much easier. Higher dps while leveling, little downtime, able to take on much stronger opponents one on one than a warrior (still not as good as a hunter, lock, or spriest for killing elites solo, but a lot better than a warrior). I mean nothing compares to a hunter, but they're kind of in their own class. I mixed up two abilities that admittedly have similar names. These things happen. What I remember clearly was the general feel of the class, and that it was fun, that I never felt underpowered, that I never had issues taking down enemies that were my level, and grinding enemies 2-4 levels below me was very good exp/hr. I could solo grind very effectively.
---
Let me put it bluntly - if you rerolled because you found rogue too hard to level, I think you're a whiny bitch and you should go back to retail. Bring on the downvotes.
---
Hmm I see people all the time. All over. Weird.
---
You get less exp if the mob is higher than you? That doesn’t seem right.
---
Where are you farming this mainly? My skinning is maxed and im at lvl 38th if that helps. I just need that sweet sweet gold
---
Yes. They're different strings and thus different channels as far as the game is concerned.
---
Global chat channels that use the /join function have been a thing since the game came out.
---
No one but role players used them.
---
Unfortunately I don’t believe there’s much of a market for tailoring/enchanting. My guild has been funneling me green items and cloth to get my skill up as I’m the only enchanter we have at the moment. I’m over 200 skill on both of them, but under 225. 
---
Good advice on badlands farming! I’m going to give that a try.
---
LayyyyyyyIiiiiiiing
---
Doesn't the pop vary throughout the day? My realm is normally low, but often jumps to medium during peak hours. 
---
Think this is just because everyone is at work/school right now, and most will be back to high in a few hours.
---
Seems like there is going to be a divide in the community then. Most people I run dungeons with are fine with people rolling need on items that they will use once they can. If you have the opportunity to roll on an item you can and will use then it's fair game. 
---
Setting more arbitrary rules on who can and can't roll on stuff is just going to make your pool of potential group members smaller.
---
Yeah, I'll bounce once TBC comes out. I'm absolutely loving vanilla WoW, and I know that TBC was a good expansion and people liked it, but once they agree to raise the level cap and rerelease an expansion the writing is on the wall for the future of Classic. We all know that while TBC and WoTLK were good expansions, WoW got worse and worse and worse over the years, just like FFXI and many other MMOs. I have no interest in watching the game slowly transmutating into something I don't want to play a second time.
---
https://static.needsmorejpeg.com/i/GR1WA.jpg there you go op, now you're FULLY ready to share your image with the world.
---
/s 
---
Obviously, that the point. Rng also doesnt reset on log in.
---
Lol feelsbadman, but here’s an upvote.
---
You used to be able to jump in there and explore hyjal when wall jumping was a thing, in original vanilla.
---
Yeah it's pretty obnoxious. Like maybe 1 in 10 groups I've been in that want to AoE farm actually do it remotely correct with little/no downtime.
---
But I'm also maining a rogue this go so I usually get relegated to pulling and the occasional adrenaline rush/blade flurry/pick off stragglers from casters so it's already inefficient and usually only slightly better than soloing for me but with a lot more involvement than just mindlessly mowing down stuff in 1's or 2's.
---
If you are alliance, do In the Name of the Light questline for bonebiter, better than ww axe, pretty easy to get, and won't take nearly as long to get.
---
You're right, but I didn't think about it for more than a second. I also didn't expect this to blow up.
---
you gotta sleep sometime
---
You lose a percentage of the mobs base XP but it's hard to notice because you still generally get more
---
Laptop...  Going to hide it in the basement lol
---
The improved models would actually be better for classic's stronger focus on RP/immersion aspect IMO
---
arent most (pvp) realms horde favored so will this help much? I don't think they mix and match pvp and pve realms right?
---
I know locks get something out of it. Warriors burn the last of their rage though. Shamans have no reason to chase. Rogues are the only ones who "waste" something
---
&gt;classic is still topping twitch streams.
---
Because it is the new "thing". The plebs that watch twitch streams and streamers will move on to the next big thing that comes out (probably Borderlands 3.)
---
It’s a Feralas quest. The item drop is from some Yetis in the area and you return it to the human by the inn at Feathermoon Stronghold. Quest I item says “Requires Level 40,” yet in the quest log it is yellow for me at level 50. I imagine it will lose it’s rep after it becomes grey in my quest log. But I don’t know when that is. Kind of weird quest. Gonna grind it as long as I can tho
---
Unless you're offering your services for money, it doesn't belong in trade. Not much to debate.
---
I offered 150 silk cloth for 2 mageweave bags. no one took me up on the offer
---
Ah, the good ol' "I'm old and have responsibilities so I should receive extra rights over others because I will always assume they are kids without jobs" card. 
---
90% of the current classic players are adults with jobs and other responsibilities. You're really acting entitled here. But not only entitled, you're throwing a childish tantrum about not receiving your assumed entitlement as well.
---
The game has been out for a little over two weeks. I've seen little kids with more patience than you over games.
---
Expansions would replace these elements, just move them up to higher levels.  Expansions need large zones, 30 or 40 levels, and avoid going the neatly packaged quest hub, easy travel, flying mounts route.  
---
Retail went a different direction than what Classic offered, and never tried to retain the original.  Instead, retail slowly tried to theme park the leveling experience, make everything related to leveling progressively easier, and relied more and more on end game content such as dailies, raids and dungeons.
---
The biggest issue with gear here is honestly tier sets.
---
You don't want new gear to invalidate old gear too much(specifically legendaries). That just kinda turns into "levels" through raiding. You'd also want to try to fix some of the "broken" specs through gear. But you also want to make sure the gear is enticing for old specs.
---
Like fixing Balance without breaking Resto. Giving Enh/Ele a boost. Making Ret/Prot less ass.
---
The one thing I'd love about new content though, is that they could rescale things a bit. And due to that uncap debuffs. Maybe it'd open up some variety in Warlock, Kitty, and Rogue.
---
&gt;I'd even go so far as wanting the transmogrification system in the game
---
Agreed; people wanted Classic for the gameplay, not the lack of cosmetic options.  Adding the newer models (especially if there was an option to use the original, maybe even as default) and the transmog system wouldn't change the actual gameplay.
---
Do you keep separate healing gear at your level? 
---
If so, what kind of stats do you look for? 
---
DPS/Tank would be: STR/AGI/Armor
---
Healing would be: SPIRIT/INT/+Heal
---
Do I have that correct?
---
This is sarcasm right? I can't tell.
---
You're just trying to justify being an asshole. Fuck you.
---
I think item level scaling made it even worse. How am I supposed to gauge how strong i am vs anything else if it has wonky scaling to both my level and my gear? Why even both collecting gear anymore? In classic i know that if i crit someone for 400, they took 400 damage. Simple.
---
Interface options=&gt;social=&gt; block chat channel invites.
---
yea censusplusclassic
---
Bravo!  Show kindness when it is warranted but show no mercy when it is deserved!
---
After looking at your comment history it's clear as fuck you've never played vanilla before. Hey, goodluck rolling need on items you want to sell lmao! You noobs really aren't gonna last long
---
Might want to look into the speed leveling meta....
---
Same general idea. He's only trying to justify being an asshole to everyone.
---
Actually, it does, if the mage in party buffs another party member who's in combat, they enter combat as well.
---
TSM has a sniper function you can setup. Not sure if that's what you're looking for or not.
---
yeah, but everyone will have a more positive view of the people they play cooperatively with than the people they fight in pvp, regardless of faction?
---
#NOCHANGES :)
---
The GM was specific to mention “from third parties”. Which means buying a token and trading gold between games would be fine. 
---
Blizzard is OK about them getting the cash for gold trades. They hate when a different company gets the cash.
---
There's no reason one server should be carrying the weight of two. You could cut some of these in half and still have two high population servers.
---
Gradual decline will effect all servers, but it will be just that, gradual and evenly. If you (like me) believe in this game at all, it will have a healthy community for a long while.
---
High pop servers aren't going to be dead any time soon. So lets break the monsters into two high pops.
---
The blade + orb will give you more throughput, but the rod will give more regen. 
---
Spirit is just too good on priest bc of the Spirit Tap talent.
---
Not somewhere I can check right now what exactly it is, but you can definitely bind it. It's something like "Special Action 1, Special Action 2...", etc.
---
Paladin is my favorite kind of tank but I am very much a Horde only kinda guy. Will play with druid tank, I think.
---
Yeah it tends to be a bunch of solo people who see LFG and go "Well I hope some group picks that guy up" rather than making the group.
---
I'm guilty of this as well, it's just funny.
---
Man you can never tell these days lol my bad
---
The amount is flat for quests I believe.
---
However, for mobs, any red mob will give the same amount as the highest level orange mob that you can kill (even if it's an elite).
---
The XP conversions are different for both, but here's a page that explains a lot of it:
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP
---
Who says I know him? He could just be a safety conscious wow player?
---
I bet you are a great laugh at parties.
---
be proud for you have the stamina of a horse lol
---
War Banners: same as Kings
---
Attack Order: an attack power buff coupled with threat reduction, which is what a mage or warlock likely would want.
---
Inspiring Aura: Battle Shout.
---
Heroic Charge: This is the fourth ability you suggest which increases attack power. 
---
Unwavering Leadership: Warriors have 2(3) abilities that remove fear already.
---
&gt;And this is why I say this sub is toxic. Try to help out by saying something thats worked for me? 
---
You're stating matter-of-factly that you cant loot a chest if a mob is near it and it's completely wrong. You cannot loot a chest if you are in combat. If you dragged it on top of someone then they were likely placed in combat with it which prevented the chest from opening. Dont point fingers at the sub for being toxic when you're the one spreading misinformation without researching it. And dont think I'm being toxic when I'm just trying to help you.
---
when that happens, i usually flip the bid filter and go down until a i see the cheapest full stack available.  usually there is some discount and its not a pain in the ass to buy.
---
I installed this addon yesterday.  I'm on Myzrael.
---
As of yesterday, it looks like your level curve is about 8'ish levels ahead of Myzrael.
---
Races look the same
---
Classes are the same except rogue.  On Myzrael, Rogues are the least represented class.  
---
Sample size?  Yours shows 8502.  Mine is/was, 13700+
---
Goes both ways, if you want to exclude someone from a roll, check BEFORE the run. I'm not talking about reneging on "reserves" as that is a dick move 100% of the time.
---
Big assumption on the MS/OS though.
---
Mage is probably one of the best farming classes.  Especially once DM is released.
---
Have you tried unplugging and plugging your keyboard into a different USB port? You need to keep trying different things so you can isolate the issue.
---
Have you tried disabling all your addons?
---
It drops, yes. Low % chance.
---
That you saw... This is why your anecdotal evidence is shit.
---
Through discourse people learn things sometimes.  Being criticized for learning though is nothing new to this game.  People should know everything all the time.
---
Wow you suck.
---
Is that some sort of personal attack?
---
If you take feral charge you give up one of our 2 defensive's , ghost wolf oh boy i get to move at 100% speed when snared not no be able to do anything but auto attack or lose the benefit, sprint? you just have a snare or root applied after and its useless, cap totem has a long cast time for a 2 second stun, hex the people can still move around! your just preventing them from attacking and they can even run into damage to try and brake it.
---
Compared to any other class that's not a warlock (really good CC) or a DK ( super tanky) every other class it teleporting/jumping/dashing around at lightning speed while shaman are left in the dust, or they have instant aoe CC along with instant single target CC or just strait up immunity's, shaman used to have a really good tool box but blizzard removed it all to turn us into a worse mage or a worse warrior with spells.
---
If you can get more than 34s from Heavy Leather its worth it to sell on the AH.  Otherwise just vendor them.
---
He must have deleted it and started a new one. I can tell you what happened without even watching the vid.
---
Meanwhile here I am mind flaying every mob that runs. Just for it to be slow enough for everyone to dumpster on.
---
I don’t have to be present to call out something that cannot be true. 
---
If you told me that one time you saw an actual dragon flying around setting buildings on fire I could confidently say you’re wrong without having been present.
---
How dare someone roll need on something they need. You overly sensitive people with your arbitrary loot rules are hilarious. 
---
"You don't need that as much as me, I'm ignoring you". So childish. Seems the nostalgia from Classic has actually turned people back into children.
---
What I did was jump around zones a lot. Loch Modan and westfall make sense since they are relatively close to eachother.  I do love darkshore though. I went there around 14/15 and knocked out a ton of quests. The beached sea creatures along the coast line are great too. 
---
Overall it took more time to do it this way, but I am playing a warrior this time around so being a little over leveled helps out immensely.
---
exactly. you can create a tab for party, guild, whispers, general chat and trade chat. no reason to have other channels.
---
Do more specs, OP
---
Guess we’ll see!
---
They do.
---
So if you clear an entire cave on your own to get to the prize at the end and someone just swoops in and steals your prize because you were clearing the last mob - they aren’t an asshole?
---
&gt;A: There is no direct means for characters in BfA to transfer gold to characters in WoW Classic. This would be highly disruptive for Classic as the economies of these two games are very different.
---
Idk how this is disruptive as its more than likely someone who plays either both games or is switching between the two. 
---
OSRS allows people to buy and sell gold across RS3 and OSRS and the only thing it did was got more people to play OSRS meaning more things flowing through the economy, meaning a more stable and less volatile AH. Blizzard is a billion dollar start up remember.
---
I tried running Deadmines w/ a DPS pally and had a real tough time switching between tank/healer. 
---
Do you normally go into it just being one? Doesn't seem possible to aggro as tank, then swap into healer when necessary. Pally did a decent job at healing while I was tanking, but still needed some extra healing from myself.
---
Auctionator to the rescue.
---
As a ret paladin I stunlock and burst people down hard, and you can stop me from chasing you cause I just Blessing of Freedom
---
The GM in the AMA even specified “third parties”. Which means the tokens are fine.
---
Unless done with friends. it's one of the reasons you can level healers fast. You can still heal dungeons while the quests for it are all red.
---
I'm offering another perspective and putting forward a question, which has spurred plenty of discussion.
---
*Your* comment, on the other hand, is just passive aggression that only serves your own emotions and contributes nothing.
---
So *shoo*, hypocrite.
---
Except that retail (with microtransactions, etc.) will make them more money than Classic (and games without MTX) ever would. Retail will continue. Classic will shrink, but still be around for its core audience.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
/join World  
---
Also in my opinion everyone that is spamming LFG are annoying as fuck. Use your eyes or start posting LFM, your LFG post is just making it harder for everyone to find an actual group, you lazy fucks.
---
Ah ok thanks, never played a priest!
---
TBF I was being sarcastic. And funnily enough I ninja edited EoK in because I wasn't sure if it was still around and said fuckit.
---
You're the reason I Mind Control Horde players off the boat just before the loading screen.
---
1. Not sure what you’re talking about with hunters but I would love it if I could auto shot during aimed shot, but you know I can’t. 2. Monks aren’t in the game. 3. Casting earthshock isn’t what we are talking about here lmao.
---
Engineering is critical
---
I don't known if its still a thing but search this sub for reddit in the last week.  They were changing something and swapping to IPv6 if I recall
---
As for dungeon completion times, varies by group and dungeon size. Some take I’d say an hour average, the lengthier ones would obviously be longer. Take wipes and mana drinks into consideration too. As for endgame dungeons, that’s more like scholomance, black rock depths and the such. Those primarily drop your pre-raid BiS. Upper and lower black rock spire are what would ultimately be considered the endgame dungeons, which I believe either one or both of them require 10-man groups. Can’t remember exactly, hopefully someone can clarify that last part.
---
Hey that might mean i actually get my Perditions Blade this time!
---
No, it was because they had to run for a bit before it would activate, and it was inarguably worse than just having a mount.
---
You *don't* have access to 9x as many resources though. The server as a whole does, but you're competing with that many more people for gathering those same resources too.
---
It could have been the original account too.
---
I wouldnt be proud, I wouldnt feel ashamed either lol. Get some rl stuff done to make up for it maybe? That's what helps me feeling guilty for the hours I play
---
People have work. People have school. Not everyone can sit at home and play video games all day. Stupid fucking post.
---
I'm right around the same on my hunter currently.  Same professions as you even.
---
My alt will be a mage or warlock with enchanting and tailoring for two reasons. 
---
1. Disenchanting greens for more AH money and weapon enchants later.
---
2. Mooncloth bags.
---
same here, my leveling partner hated it at first... but now helps me pointing out every corpse he see for me to rez
---
Look at the edge on this dude... Lol
---
Can you even right now?
---
Not till you are super geared
---
She’s bad in Captain Marvel, she is not a bad actress though
---
Am I out of touch? No, it's the children who are wrong
---
&gt; Literally everyone in retail follows those builds because they're the best.
---
Cool I'll say the same about BIS lists for Classic. The data isn't out yet, but people getting to 60, then continuing to play for the purposes of raiding/PVP are going to follow them slavishly.
---
&gt; If you look at any guide site for classic WoW, each spec will have 3-4 different builds
---
Kinda. Those places usually have a leveling build, a raiding build, and a PvP build.
---
As a quick example though IcyVeins has 4 listed for hunter that aren't leveling. One is listed as "sub optimal". One is listed as only being good with very low gear levels. One is also listed as only good with low gear. And the last is recommended. 
---
Now compared to retail things get strange. That was two MM builds, one BM build, and one Surv build. Retail obviously has one of each as well. Within those BM is the least flexiable with the fewest flex picks, MM is next, and Survival has 3 rows(all rotation based) that have multiple not just viable, but actually recommended talents, leading to two distinctly different builds.
---
So if you want to be reductive as possible, that's 4 to both, but the 4 in Retail are all comparable and distinct, while the 4 in Classic are clearly delineated into a hierarchy.
---
Again, though. You can't say people are going to only pick the optimal talents in Retail, then say "Oh there's choices in Classic" when one is the clearly optimal choice and then assume people won't pick it. You have to hold both games to the same standard, so either the players will always choose optimally or they will play whatever they want. Otherwise you're comparing things on different metrics.
---
&gt; I can deal with a fair fight, but open world PVP is full of cowards and griefers most of the time. 
---
AND then they complain about one another doing the same things to each other.
---
It would be easier to just stay off Reddit. Honestly though, you shouldn't be surprised when the troll priest is a trolly priest.
---
Rogues and Hunters are the only two classes that can exit combat. Rogues also can stealth.
---
This means the Rogue Engineer can Vanish, Stealth, and res someone with Goblin Jumper Cables.
---
Not running back after the healer fell asleep at 3am, letting the tank die, and the rest of the group get murdered is utility.
---
A wise rogue would have denied he has the skill to unlock the chest and circled back to it afterwards.
---
Agreed 100%.
---
Some of the PvP servers faction balance is so one sided, it makes it unplayable at times.
---
Crippling in offhand is good on dungeons where mobs run and aggro others. Otherwise just throw instant poison on there for more damage. 
---
As far as kick use, generally the caster should be skull anyway so you shouldn't have to swap targets and kick. Keep in mind that every time you swap targets you lose your combo points. So honestly in low level dungeons, unless it's a heal, cc or other disruptive spell, I wouldn't lose my combo points to kick it. But if you are at 0 point anyway, might as well hop over and kick that shadowbolt to help the healer out.
---
Yes, also if you’re in a party you can see exactly where the members are on the map.
---
Yeah clique has been updated for a while now. People really need to just stop using the twitch app for installing macros bc the search sucks ass. Install it yourself and just use twitch app to update
---
I mean if he gets hit by something, there is an animation and his character should react to it, maybe he just stopped thinking he is in combat and noticed he can continue? Or maybe it's just a bug, who knows.
---
Same. They were waiting almost an hour for a tank anyways, so they were able to wait another while lol.
---
If you have windows 10 its very easy
---
Do something cool you wish you had screen recorded?
---
Hit WindowsKey+G and it'll record the last 30seconds(can be adjusted for more time) just like "xbox record that" function
---
You can do it OP! And you will be stronger because of it!
---
Orcs are the best warriors by far and they get +5 axe skill. Axe spec talents are also generally regarded as the best, barring some niche applications of the other weapon specializations. Mace spec isn't horrible either, but not until 60+ and deep in pvp is it valuable at all.
---
I think you're right, yeah, if it fails on the first line then it won't progress to the next one. So you should be good with:
---
/cast Earth Shock
---
I stopped reading at "you retailiers" get the fuck over yourself seriously. I hear all these amazing stories about peoples great vanilla experiences with awesome people and then when people like you come through with this "us vs them" attitude and it makes me fucking sick. Seriously, we dont want that attitude here. Drop your shit you elitist asshole.
---
should have mailed them back a copper and said suck it
---
Why play a hunter when lock exists.
---
Look at the color of the mobs unit frame. If it's gray, someone else tagged it and you can help. If it's red, no one has tagged it yet, or you tagged it.
---
&gt;Vendor things that barely sell for more on the AH. I was surprised at what I had to vendor - most gems up to Citrine, rare spider silks...but if it vendors for 10s and there's 20 on the AH for 15s...just vendor it.
---
if you have 10 things that vendor for 10s but AH for 15s, you're missing out on 50s by vendoring them instead. that shit adds up.
---
what was your purpose with this post?
---
*some people just want to watch the world burn indeed*
---
Oh shit I need to call my mom and see if this is still there!
---
Work is where I do all my Classic WoW research.
---
Oh okay. Then I should refuse to believe people saying anything then.
---
Depended heavily on class.  Worked like shit on rogue and caster.
---
How's that working out for trade chat? It's always been used to find groups and it will always continue to be used for finding groups. Why does it matter so much?
---
I figured it out, it was a key repeat function on my ducky shine 3 keyboard. But it was so weird because sometimes it would let me move normally other times it would bug out. And being stuck in jump animation (that other players could see) didn't seem like it could be a key repeat issue. Very weird...
---
Saved!
---
Most people requested launch off. So yeah it's slowing down cuz most people don't have unlimited PTO.
---
So, my theory is that Garrison turned into a fall guy for a bad expansion.  
---
Garrison was blamed for people being isolated, never leaving the garrison, and just queuing up for content.  
---
My position is that there was nothing to leave the garrison for and if garrisons were the real problem, then class halls would have had the same problem. It didn’t.  
---
Sure, garrisons didn’t need to hand you ore and herbs, but customizing it, and working to guild it up and followers being an engaging mini game. I loved it tbh. I liked doing quests for followers or doing dungeon achieves. I loved gearing them up and customizing them for missions.  
---
Was it perfect? No, but I wish we had kept better aspects of garrisons, instead of the bland mission table we have now.
---
This actually made me want to roleplay as a retarded undead rogue who preys on the weak and eats their corpses
---
Yeah, support classes are fun. They have them in FFXIV. Melee, ranged and caster DPS all have at least one support job that is mainly used to buff other, harder-hitting jobs.
---
Their plan is to disable layering when the world bosses are released. (I think its phase 2).
---
Or what else are they going to do, never release any of the remaining content until people quit the game?
---
I think that these are mostly just cowards who don't give a shit and are just griefers who have fun by ruining someone's experience. Their idea of PvP is mindless killing. This would explain why they all complain about each other and then do the same behavior.
---
Now this I can get behind
---
It’s real. Not even just vanilla, I was a BC baby. 
---
It was the craziest thing to see these websites spelled out with toons floating in the middle of the air. Sometimes they danced. 
---
Sometimes they died and spelled it on the ground. It was hella good advertising though.
---
The problem there is that transaction costs are significant.
---
First of all, there's 5% auction house cut, but there is a real risk that you will have to relist an item and eat a deposit or two. There is time spent screwing with mailing stuff to your alts, Then there is time to appraise the item and check auctions for that item, and similar items, ideally over a period of time, then list it.
---
If you instead funnel that to a person who is going to equip it, it's just a lot more efficient. I do sympathize a bit at low levels with clothies, as all the big money vendor trash is often a signficicant upgrade for some warrior... but there is still very good reason not to roll need on stuff you can't equip. For the same reason I am not saving sharp claws or large fangs. Because it's not worth my time.
---
I have two tabs. One for everything, and one just for guild/party/raid/whispers.
---
TBH, I was this UNITS slave for 7 hours! Hell I'd even fully wait 12 hours for him if that what it takes.
---
I just need to figure out which one I should camp next...
---
Take the zep to the east and go hang out in southern silver pine. You can grab the inn and bird at seplucher and work your way towards hillsbrad. Change of pace.
---
I personally like barrens chat.

---
The only people who are on are people not working, have no jobs, or in school
---
the real problem with this comes down to spending money on training the necessary skills. i would say healing is better due to this.
---
I enjoyed the post.
---
Demo and battle shout shouldn't be used if you have a warrior tank as spaming them generates more threat than a ravanger proc and is the only way warrior tanks can tank 10+ mob pulls.
---
That’s why I made sure to get my wife addicted to Classic as well. Even took the time to set up a series of chairs and a table so we play together.
---
Man, if there was only some sort of massive database that you could search for something like this....
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4621/avast-ye-admiral
---
Are you on a pvp server? I'm on PvE and every instance has been so smooth it felt like I was on a Disney ride. All pugs too. 
---
That being said Gnomer is gross. I avoided it entirely in vanilla. In classic I have run 3 or 4 times, only once did we not complete it and that was mostly due to the tank having to sleep.
---
lol thanks my bad
---
Less talky more Kingsy
---
Cant believe you made a post about this...
---
Wrong thats backwards. Elemental for Rogues and kitty druids, Tribal for tree or feather druids
---
What's delusional is trying to desperately invent a difference between 500 gold and an item worth 500 gold. Everyone realizes that they're the same exact thing as it relates to character progression, so your arguments are fruitless and illogical.
---
"Cash before gear" doesn't mean a damn thing. You buy gear with cash. In fact, cash is slightly more valuable since you can do more things with it such as respec, train skills, buy your epic mount, etc. Again, this shouldn't be a huge revelation since the same relationship exists in real life.
---
Ah, dang, I’m on Grobbulus. I’ll have to find 4 others to con into this sometime!
---
Aren't we an edgyboi today! Did your mom take away your hanwei katana because you were being bad?
---
All tier gear will drop from the appropriate mobs and PvP gear will be available from the appropriate vendors when honor system is out.
---
I heard one of the original devs replying about that suggestion. He basically said that there was a reason why those zones were never released. Because they were just not good enough. 
---
Can't remember the exact words.
---
&gt;Sample size? Yours shows 8502. Mine is/was, 13700+
---
It only takes players online so it could be at different times of day
---
Doing things for your own benefit at another's expense is literally the definition of being a bad person.
---
And its 100% your right to be that way, it adds a lot of flavor to the experience. I think the only thing I have a problem with is when people try to do mental gymnastics to call their behavior not dickish.
---
Best way to start working routines.
---
I work in a IT company, only here in my project we're 4 people playing together and discussing wow stuff.

And it was amazing. They flew over the mountain from northshire in a huge line then spelled shit out In sw

Hold on, got to position the phone just right.... I could just hit a button, but this just seems... More convenient....

Guild Wars 2’s raids do have awesome mechanics and complexity. The main issue is that if you bring a ‘meta’ group, it completely trivializes almost every fight. Your damage just gets so high that the boss is dead before mechanics become an issue. It also leads to a lot of elitism and rigid group compositions. I love that game dearly, but its end game content is just too easy due to ANet’s bad balance.
---
it's about time someone started selling gold. it's really a pain to get and I am burned out on leveling. I'd rather pay $ for gold.
---
based
---
People spammed LFG in Trade back in vanilla too, I don't think it is going to change is Classic neither.
---
I'm not talking about high levels, either. I'm talking about everyone questing together, all equal level.
---
I played in vanilla and bc and I do all of those things, sadly.
---
I guess we've had different experiences then.
---
I did love some GW2. I felt like it was the first MMO post-Vanilla that didn't try to copy WOW's formula. I think doing away with the DPS/Tank/Heal trinity wasn't the greatest idea, but everything else about the gameplay was wonderful.
---
The cooking mechanic, specifically learning new recipes, was awesome.
---
&gt; Most healers don't even heal during dungeons. 
---
Most healers don't even heal during dungeons. You just plow through them anyways. No way I'm going OOM several times just to give my healer some water they don't even need.
---
&gt; Spewing this everytime you comment doesn't suddenly make you right or intelligent.
---
I say that line **because** I'm both right and intelligent.  I'm smart enough to know that healers need water, and I know I'm right because *I've already been there.*    I leveled every class to max *on both factions* in vanilla.
---
If those leaks were fake they're the best fake leaks ever. Also they come from a source that's been correct for 3 expansion leaks in a row, so Id say the rumors are quite credible.
---
So small
---
Did you just re-enact this video: https://redd.it/d282ny
---
its called special action in the keybinds, but you cant make a stealth macro so most people just put stealth somewhere on their normal bars to make it macro-able
---
I just hit level 20, but all my quests in Redridge are dark red for me, and I'm too low for Duskwood quests as well. Where do I go for a couple levels?
---
Thank you so much for posting this. These types of posts are by far my favorite in all of r/classicwow
---
Look up burden of proof. You can't prove a negative, it's not possible. You can't prove that I'm not typing this while the ghost of Benjamin Franklin dictates our response. Based on the knowledge we have of how the universe operates you could pretty confidently say I'm lying but you can't prove it.
---
Certainly, you wouldnt heed my advice if I said, "If you want to meet the ghost of Benjamin Franklin, drink lots of blue mountain dew and chocolate so that you're stuck in the bathroom for an hour and he'll show up, it worked for me."
---
Same as if it *was* a glitch and not him accidentally moving or aggroing something, it's not sound advice to say "just drag a mob on the chest and with a 1 in a googol chance you cancel his looting."
---
But needing on BOEs is SOP, you're an idiot if you roll greed and an even bigger idiot if you go bitch about it in trade chat later.
---
Also, not sure if you know, there's no potion limit in classic, so I run around rocking like four or five at a time.
---
Better be amazing for how much mana it costs us lol I've actually run down warriors to buff them while mana regens haha
---
Nope. Wasn't there in vanilla. No changes.
---
Great, thanks so much!

---
Perfect, thank you!
---
Bingo. Guarantee I'd get a ban for abuse.
---
What add-one do you have
---
it was, i just dug up my old screenshots
---

Those are from Feburary/March 2005
---
What was sad about it? I thought it was pretty neat when I first saw it...and then whatever everyday after. But sad?
---
People will tell you different things but the key to take is you need 5 spirit tap 5 wand spec. Other than that either go disc or shadow, I'd prefer Disc for duoing and think disc or shadow for soloing are close together.
---
It's oft-recommended to go for shadow talents 20-40, but on their own they don't do much -- you end up with things like blackout and shadow weaving when your rotation only contains 1-2 shadow spells duoing. It's arguably better to get more sta/strong heals/more mana regen in disc.
---
Once you get 40, even if you go shadow (other than 5 wand spec), you're going to want to pay the 1g to respec all shadow and get the big daddy damage talents to make shadow really hurt, shadowform/darkness, and then you'll never cast holy fire/smite again (I gave up smite fairly early in favor of holy fire pre-40, but some prefer smite -&gt; mind blast -&gt; pain -&gt; wand to holy fire -&gt; mind blast -&gt; pain -&gt; wand).
---
Truth, it was a fallacy back in the day to skip spirit on locks because durr Life Tap but time spent doing that is time lost doing anything else like casting. Locks are also a dlave to the 5sec rule like everyone else
---
You are not being anal about it.
---
People are wrong and thats all. I have never heard someone call it Spellcleave (Not on retail or P-Servers) because the term is just wrong and stupid.
---
A Cleave usually targets 2-3 enemies but they are going for +10 most of the time.
---
On the two Server (PVP server, so I need two for different factions) the people just call it AoE Farms and thats it.
---
I am level 27, is it possible to farm those there, while being completely underleveled?
---
It's not every day you see a Mithril Vein!
---
Yeah I kill them too
---
I kill them alone or in roaming packs
---
I kill them while they're gathering, questing, grinding, traveling, or AFK
---
They do the same to me. If they don't, they're weak and must be purged
---
the tram comes every 2 seconds, humans are impatient scum
---
zug zug
---
I think you mean DM
---
Haha yep realized that pretty quick. Somehow were able to kill VC.
---
Made a druid because on my priest we were always looking for a tank. Now on my druid I'm always looking for a healer... haha. At least w/ the druid I have the option of being either.
---
Ions cause ionization also known as rust.  You get ions you decay from rust.
---
Anyone know the status of cross-realm BGs? 
---
I really, really hope the stay server only like they were in Classic. There’s just something about seeing the same people in your BGs/out in the wild. It makes me much more competitive when I have a personal vendetta against the person/team I’m fighting against instead of just randoms from a different server that I’ll never see again
---
Also a lot of the private server people that liked hunter's niche in pvp aren't playing with the 1.12 DR status.
---
Love this concept, downloaded!
---
It could be that private servers were overtuned, but for whatever it’s worth those of us who played on them watched guilds rise and fall based on how rigid/flexible they were with min/maxing (and all the loot drama that inevitably comes along with it).  I don’t want to tell anyone how to play, but it’s hard to completely forget lessons learned from private servers, especially when they were old truisms you were skeptical of initially,  and then ultimately they proved correct.

I just take Kratom to make up for it. I doubt it's healthy and doing that enough catches up to ya.
---
Not sure what you mean, but the actual half way point is lvl 47
---
I feel like the pro might be significantly stronger than the air
---
A human Druid? Very rare.
---
&gt; young man destined to be the star of their faction, turned bad guy/evil trying to do the right thing for both, ending up both as some sort of monster in a terrifying armor.
---
Do you actually think this super generic storyline was invented with The Phantom Menace?
---
yea, thats true, I never think about it, but they should run out more than hunters (just less quickly) since it's kind of a off item that isn't used a ton.

---
Their plan also involves taking measures to encourage people to spread out to more servers, such as the free transfers they started last week.
---
What about “15 years ago I never got to do X. But now I finally did X!”
---
Hit up UC. Probably plenty of folk there looking to eat up a gnome
---
Earth mage for tanking too.
---
Noggenfogger has 10k horde and 0 alliance.
---
Lul
---
Yeah you don't. Maybe if they are afk and you swing away at them for 20 minutes. But 7 levels? You'd be lucky to even land a hit bro. You obviously don't know how to play and you have made that obvious, thanks.
---
get auctionator
---
He realized it... just a bit too late
---
I'd rather delete my account than play alliance.
---
ah yes cats are known to react to an attack like this yes ah yes very defensive
---
Yes master
---
I honestly never knew that

As far as spec for her, I'd suggest this:

---
If she's going to be tanking a lot, i'd go straight arms for anger management ASAP.   
---
If she's going to be leveling out in the world, i'd grab 5/5 cruelty first, and then proceed down the arms tree.
---
Exactly.

I thought my five days /played was bad enough!

Love watching a slapfight with no real winner.

An example that is irrelevant when none of the people in question are capable of nuance.

Its the opposite for me. I have 2 kids and my friends don't yet I'm ahead of them. But I work 3rd shift and play when everyone is either asleep or at school so easily 4-8 hours a day during weekdays until the weekend.

i thought it was 50/50 either happens or it doesnt
---
Just got disconnected
---
I haven't trolled or flamed you in any way. Simply pointed out that you have no way of knowing what was happening to the other individual involved in your "personal experience", yet you are trying to say definitively that you know exactly what happened. You have also shown to not understand the mechanics of the game by saying "he was never hit" as a defense for why he couldn't have been put into combat. This makes you an unreliable narrator due to ignorance. 
---
You are being extremely toxic after crying about people being toxic..... You personally attacked me during our first interaction yet you continue to complain about people personally attacking you. 
---
You are clearly uneducated on the topic at hand. You clearly communicate in an immature way. You are the issue here, nobody else. Grow up. 
---
Have a GREAT day.
---
PLS GOD
---
For solo-leveling and healing dungeons, go with the rod and make sure to max out Spirit Tap.
---
Flamelash too
---
Best auction house addon? Go!
---
Firemaw too
---
Lucifron as well.
---
Firemaw too.
---
i tried but im a gnome aswell
---
That is the way the hammer of Thor is spelled, though
---
You only lose the deposit if it doesn't sell
---
&gt;As this happens, **an Undead Mage is running through town casting Arcane Intellect** on everyone. He enters combat and the goblins collapse on him. **Another mage runs by, a Troll, casting Frost Nova.** He's trying to save them.
---
There's 2 mages in this story.
---
We're talking about the Troll.
---
Golemagg EU too
---
Right side would be more accurate with something about resisting or being immune to my spells...
---
Dear God, this fucking mob resisted 5 straight frostbolts once and I wanted to kill myself.
---
Skullflame as well
---
Firemaw is down
---
Wetlands or (my favourite zone) Ashenvale
---
Shazzrah here, massive lag, guildies complaining as well
---
yep
---
Agreed. Thanks for spreading the correct information 😊
---
That macro has been around forever to removed the item from trade and hit trade at same time hoping you hit trade aswell..just dont rush trades and pay attention it's not hard
---
All you had to do was reach Ashenvale though! And there are more reasons why things are gloomy.
---
The extra slots can help you make more money.
---
and then what, renege on your agreement?
---
Golemagg too
---
Gehennas aswell.
---
Someone randomly gave me 4 6 slot bags when I was level 9. I'll never forget and I make sure to pass it on when I'm in goldshire! Thank you level 15 NE druid! I love you!
---
Sulfuron too
---
Shazzrah as well
---
PlS GoD
---
Razorgore too.
---
Ashbringer dead too
---
Looks like a druid tank build, fine for dungeons or as an offtank in raids.
---
Ha ok kid.
---
Shazzrah too
---
&gt;I feel like the friendly nostalgia is wearing off and people are slowly going back to their 2019 toxic gaming behaviors/attitudes

---
yup
---
Yeah because people like you are spamming it. You can't complain if you're part of the problem.
---
That is pretty much the only way you win as warrior. They're bottom tier in 1v1 for a reason.
---
i can feel it lingering
---
Or, you know, just don't be an asshole.
---
Sorry if this has been asked but what addon do you use to get your skills like that it looks really nice but i cant find anything on curse forge.
---
How is that unhealthy or a surprise? Levelling up is the clearest goal in the game, most people try to focus play time on one character, and most people interested in Classic played a lot the first 2 weeks.
---
then heroic sets were massive upgrades, even with only 2 set bonuses
---
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
Kill stuff. Turn in quests. Sell stuff.
---
Also DC on shazzrah but can log in again
---
Ashbringer EU down.
---
Gehennas is rip bois
---
Firemaw is down :(
---
Seems better after a relog
---
As a tank, if I see someone running away with a mob I just let it kill them.
---
The problem was that there are all these people with computers running the battle net launcher in the background showing as idle and they provided no option outside of addons to hide all this useless info. Showing 6 idle computers right at the top so you have to scroll down to find people who are actually online is really dumb.
---
Doubtful. I don't know the level of the mobs but you pretty much can't fight anything that outlevels you by 3. You could run SFK a few times though. They have the fel steed bag, assuming you don't have all 10 slotters already. Or farm silk and have a guildie make or someone else in a city. If you have 10 slotters at this point you should be good. I never run out of room
---
You can't

---
Yea same folks that didn’t mind the queue because they’ve been logged in since 10am.(which is what I have done on the weekends honestly).
---
Yes I have the Bombay from the 'Cat Lady' :) she has 2 different ginger ones too and another tabby.
---
Yeah I've had to kick guildies who were pieces of shit to other players. People dont get that that kind of stuff reflects on the guild too.
---
It happens when I close anything.  Menus, bags, etc.
---
Someone need to start a UBER guild you can contact to be teleported for some PA
---
How do u stop the hardcore players from outleveling the players who are less so? Without timegating to the point of making time played mean nothing, i dont think its healthy to stop players from playing your game the eay they want to.
---
I made the mistake of walking though a random moongate once. Once. I ended up in a room full of giant snakes, gargoyles, demons, skeleton mages, and a bunch of other stuff that filled up the screen. I ran back in so fast.
---
Thats more believable
---
meanwhile thanks to layering you see only broken tooths on lvl 60 hunters
---
Fuck that's evil
---
The only time actual other-faction hate comes in is when that faction has a significant number advantage.
---
Otherwise it's just personal.  tbh I'm only on a pvp server myself because the people I play with wanted to.  I honestly could do without having cowards cost me a 10% play time tax (assuming I don't want to instance spam my way to 60) simply because I chose the faction which has fewer players on the server.  World PvP is a neat idea in concept, but in practice it's just cowards getting their rocks off in unfair fights.  I'm sure that's fun for some people, but when you're always on the receiving end and very rarely see an opportunity to start an unfair fight yourself in comparison, it's just annoying and tedious.
---
But hey, I'm still enjoying myself overall, and that's what counts.  Just have to log off when I'm getting corpse camped and play Path of Exile, no problem.
---
Fake news, and your post has been reported for harassment. 
---
This isn't a PSA, it's you trying to greedily brainwash folks.
---
WHAT
---
Thank you... that’s amazing.

Nobody wants to watch shitty click bait

Actually I own the mining rights to deadmines, you'll be hearing from my lawyer .

I had a priest need roll, and win, Cookie's Tenderizer, despite our tank using a level 10 green.

And she was about to get the staff from the VC quest!

30 hours a day
---
BUDDY
---
Have you reinstalled
---
Is there a census that’s been done on each server yet? I’m curious to know the current pops and ratios.
---
Rather have a faster offhand weapon
---
It doesn’t hold aggro nor does it gain aggro back. I have spammed demo shout constantly and always have to chase the add that moved to the next person because their aggro was too much. Not sure where this misconception comes from. But it doesn’t hold all aggro all the time, nor does it reestablish threat.
---
Have you actually spoken to the leadership to discuss this? Or have you just stewed over this and come to reddit for their thoughts? I’ll warn you, much of reddit will be immediately against anything that can be spun as remotely shady, even without full context or information being provided.
---
Is the guild **requiring** donations, or is it only incentivized? How much EP is gained from these donations compared to how much would normally be accumulated from participation? Have they outlined specifically what these donations are for? Mats? Patterns? If their goal is to try and use this in order to purchase highly sought after items, such as Warden Staff or a Lionheart Helm pattern or a flask recipe, is that really them trying to use it in an improper manner?
---
There’s a lot of supplemental information that is needed to make a fair assessment of the situation, and help weigh in. IMO, you should honestly sit down and speak to the leadership of your guild about this. Maybe it’ll help ease your distress, maybe help usher a change in policy, or push you to realize that this is a deal breaker for you.
---
no problem.
---
Hp matters when im wandering around a zone auto attacking every spawn I can snag to just aoe them all down together :)
---
You forgot to ask a question
---
Weird flex but ok. I have an opposite experience though. It seem like there was more than one way of playing vanilla wow.
---
right? LFG/LFM was always spammed in trade chat. You use general chat to help as well if you're out questing in the area or you're at the dungeon. Blizzard created the LFG button that found a group for you but now that we're back to basics, you are gonna search in trade chat and general chat, as has always been
---
So does that mean it's a free roll for everyone when you blow it with engineering?
---
BoE Epic sure, everyone needs. 
---
But engineering plans and low lvl shit, just give it to the fucking engineer.
---
Sometimes you get little fucktards needing, but most of the time people are cool and give it to the person that can use it. They are then obligated to equip/use it at that moment.
---
Not my problem that you've ruined the game for yourself by being too afraid to do stuff with no prior knowledge
---
Since using that macro I've had it not work 1 time. And by "not work" I mean it didn't drop the trap. It did however drop me from combat and I manually dropped the trap. But, kind of misses the point.
---
putting your hard drive in the microwave and turning it on for 1 minute should do that trick.
---
Aux?  Why is that better. What are better ones
---
Consecrate for sure.  Makes AOE threat a non-issue.  Also, be sure to bring plenty of water cause you'll need it.
---
\*slow claps as he stands up and then begins to speed up his clapping\* FOR. THE. ALLIANCE! /charge the dead Orc Warrior's body and starts Teabagging him like he actually got the kill
---
Yes as in 30 hour play sessions. Technically over 1 day.
---
Consecrate.
---
There are plenty of other places to level
---
Or dungeon spam. stv is known for the fighting. It doesn’t just happen to alliance. I’ve been ganked by alliance 100 times there.
---
Because theres 15 years of information on it.
---
It’s not nearly as elaborate, but certain boosters for a certain site during legion would spell their website out in feasts in cities and outside of raids. Weird way to flex your gold.
---
No it's definitely poor form. If you're like 1 level off it's acceptable but if you're level 33 and the Axe requires level 37 you won't be able to use that Axe for a while and it's definitely BM to roll need on it. If you're within 1 level range it's acceptable but imo still pretty BM.
---
If you were on a pvp server people could kill you or the npcs around you which would make the game more difficult.
---
Combat Medic: STVietnam.
---
Giving credit for lockpick, distract and poisons but not combat Rez, heals, 40% movement form and buffs is an interesting take on class utility.
---
My internet fell off around 6PM, came back some minutes later, got into a 7k queue, 1 hour later it still was 7k, 30 minutes later it went to 2k, 5 minutes later to 740, and now it's been on 740 for 40 minutes.
---
alright, thank you so much! looking forward to visiting Azeroth again :D
---
As a warrior, that's the reason I now refuse Sharmans in groupe
---
In my realm the actual pop is like 70% Horde 30% Alliance.   
---
I keep messing around hillsbrad when I'm going to Scarlet Monastery and getting a few Hordes mad with sap.. They just want to PvE =/
---
What about linking the actual enchant? Shift click the icon in the enchanting menu I think.
---
As a warrior I thank you for this. It’s been rough questing alone but I’m getting there.
---
Lol I wanted to say this 😂
---
Agreed. The little rivalries and the opportunity to get revenge are such an important social aspect of the PvP scene on a given server. It's way less engaging if you end up against a bunch of random people every game.
---
i recommend playing throuh Warcraft 3, it can be beaten in ~15hrs with the xpac and will fill in most of the holes from the earlier games
---
I think everyone is just dumping material+crafted items as fast as they can trying to earn a little extra cheddar for that mount, which leads to people undercutting the market over and over again trying to make sure their items actually sell.
---
they were like 20 levels below me
---
My groups have been good, people just take turns getting hits on mining nodes!
---
I must've not tried hard enough but I'm pretty sure you can't get to Loch Modan from Wetlands.
---
I have been tankging dungeons non stop in Classic and Demo Shout absolutely does hold threat against AoE.  Just yesterday I ran Maraudon three times and all I did to hold threat against the small worms was spam Demo Shout &amp; auto attack and I held threat against a mage casting Blizzard and two warlocks spamming Hellfire.
---
 Bar 1 is the only one you can change iirc. There might be an addon that does that but classic UI's are littered with skills xD.
---
You can also make bandages in feral form
---
10000% yes, and fuck this constant "AOE CLEAVE" spam on every single LFG/World channel, fuck it hard.   
---
What really makes me laugh are the LFM SPELL CLEAVE SM, NEED 3 MAGES AND TANK....so, you're alone and trying to form a VERY specific group leaving out a huge chunk of players...AND they'll spend hours spamming it when they could just run a normal PUG and have completed it multiple times by now.   
---
But what REALLY pisses me off is how this excludes rogues and hunters from groups.   
---
I really wish this crap never came about, and I'd be all for some minor changes to stop it as well.
---
you're bored because you've set yourself up for a boring time. people who make Vanilla WoW's old ceiling the new floor for WoW Classic are just gonna be underwhelmed.

This leveling guide is insanely good for Warriors.  I initially started using this because someone on this subreddit said you could level without having to grind, it's been 30 levels and it's pretty true I haven't had to grind.
---
Looks like perhaps an auto brightness setting out your display.  Try going through the monitors settings and look for it.  It may be something like an Eco or power saving option.
---
What happened to Imexiel?
---
"I'm not complaining, I just stated I complain a lot when it actually happens."

god that UI gives me eye cancer

Where else can I go yo level because I'm honestly just done with this cancer.

The million dollar question:
---
Did the leggings drop in Cath for you?
---
same here man. I said, well lets play for fun a couple of hours and retire 
---
me now : lvl 40 warlock 24/7 online
---
Yo, I played a tiny tiny bit of LotRO a loooong time ago.  I had no idea that's what Captain did, that's awesome!!
---
Not using any addons but here's some tips; Put things available in multiple stances (Heroic Strike, Cleave, Battle Shout, Demo Shout, etc) on the bars that don't change. Put stance specific things (Charge, overpower / Revenge, disarm / Whirlwind, pummel / etc) on the bars that do change.
---
A problem is quest drop rates are so low and quest items are not shareable loot as they have now come to be on retail, so people don’t want to group up at all. And the stops community building dead in its tracks. 
---
I would much rather quests be a straight kill 100 mobs then find 10 drops 1 out of 10. Because I can get a group for kill 100 mins very fast.
---
&gt; This is how WoW has always worked.
---
Bolding something doesn't magically make it a true statement.
---
WoW has worked countless different ways over the years as the game and community have evolved. Everyone has their own opinion on how loot should be done, there has absolutely not been a single standard for how it "has always worked."
---
I remember the countless threads over whether or not enchanters should get a larger than proportional cut for offering DE services for unwanted boss drops. Do you roll on every shard? Do you keep them all until the end and try to hand out 1 shard to each player? The expectation changed multiple times over the course of my vanilla experience. What about skinning/herbing/mining? Pristine hide of the beast anyone? 
---
What about rolling need for OS over someone's MS? What about rolling need for a marginal upgrade over someone for whom it would be a major upgrade? Definitely good reasons both ways.
---
In my personal experience I've seen high value BoEs mainly handled in three ways:
---
1) everyone greed no matter what, because we can all use the gold
---
2) everyone greed unless you're able to equip on the spot
---
3) everyone need no matter what, because we can all use the gold and this prevents the last person rolling from ninja'ing it
---
To say one singular method is the way it has always been done is beyond ridiculous.
---
that's hilarious though
---
We are talking about 20-300g items. 
---
My real life examples DO apply because they the value is relative. I ran this dungeon for 2 hours, there is no reason I should pass up a 200g windfall for someone who doesn't deserve it any more than me because of made up rules.
---
You know how their kind are, savages!
---
Lol, the subtext in Warcraft really bleeding into real life.
---
cross-realm was in vanilla. there were battle groups which consisted of 3-4 servers. You still had the competitive nature as it was more balanced. If you did enough BGs you saw the same groups on a semi consistent basis.
---
I was doing that same quest a couple days ago as a lock. And I swam around buffing everyone I was so excited my buff was actually useful for once.
---
Yes and we should, I love it!
---
I am very confident that the voice lines would indeed be replaced by today's WoW voice actors for Reforged.
---
They are doing a lot of reworkings...graphics, sound, and definitely voice acting would help put a "fresh coat of paint" on it - can't say it'll be "better", but it will feel less stale for those of who've played Warcraft 3 back in the day.
---
How the hell do you counter a rogue or hunter? Every hunter I've encountered has one-shot me.
---
MC wasn’t nerfed outside of the raise in debuff slots, better gear, and talents.
---
When people get booted out of the queue, they have a "Grace period" so they can join back into the queue where they were pushing people back up. Just like how when you get d/c'ed you have a bit of time to get back into the server before you have to queue.   
---
Hope this clears things up my dude :)
---
The same as you now, everyone else would be in the queue.
---
When layering is removed the servers will have the population cap of 1 layer, not all of they combined.
---
That helm's amazing for cat druids. Less useful for bears, since the bonus rage eventually stops being worth as much as higher armor and stats.
---
Your title is trying to push people out of using trade chat to look for groups EVEN THOUGH it works to find groups and find additional people. LFG is full of drama more than it is full of finding groups. I've muted more people in LFG than any other chat because they SPAM so much or have drama nobody cares about.
---
Trade chat has had constant success in finding groups AND finding items. It's almost like I'm trading my time and services for the group in exchange for experience.
---
I have no idea what point you're trying to make with your messages, or if you're reading anything I type before writing and sending them, so I'll let you have your own fun in your own world.
---
Personally think AH add-ons are a absolute must, even if you sell only a few items. Way easier to sort by the actual buy out price! Personally, I prefer auctionator.
---
I never saw the leggings period
---
Why? Poisons are a PPM ratio, slow vs fast doesn’t matter. Not only that, but if you are combat swords, why on earth would you use a dagger in your offhand?
---
He looks like a normal cat but his atk speed is 1.2 instead of 2.0 like most.  Broken tooth is the only cat with a faster atk.
---
He quit 100%
---
ye pve
---
Which is short for 'would have'
---
With edgemasters hand guards this is a decent setup. You will want to replace thrash blade with a higher damage main hand when you can. If you are willing to spend good Krol Blade &amp; Alcor's Sunrazor is a good combo.
---
Ppl are to shy to roll need and then ask to buy some green off of me I'm like dude u can have it.  But also dude just roll need if you need I don't care lol
---
Try disabling all addons if any, delete wtf and interface map, repair(if that still is a thing?) Or reinstall
---
this is amazing.
---
I actually like the auction house, but I missed this concept from old MMOs, where a player would open his own private store.
---
Gratz
---
A single encounter does not ruin an entire class.
---
Your class dynamic changes fight to fight, what you may be doing changes fight to fight, this is part of the game. This is also part of being an OFF tank and a UTILITY/Hybrid. 
---
But you aren't caring about reading, you just are on the druid hate train.
---
Let your group die then you can skin them, too...
---
You have gotten shitty people. Every instance chest since Deadmines has been /roll for the groups I have been in. Maybe PvE servers are full of lovely Carebears who hug rainbows but I dig it.
---
Guess it must've been a coincidence on my part that it always ended up on the last roll.  Good to know then!
---
How about you actually try to think logically about what I said and formulate a response instead of spewing out some bullshit like this.
---
If you look at stories from that kind of broad, "from the top" perspective, then really nearly every story is the same, many of them either based on "the hero's journey" template or some other story telling template we've all seen for decades.
---
If you just look past the details, then really let me ask you - what story in the last 40 years has any trace of uniqueness to it? There aren't any, right?
---
They still can't quite figure out what to do with disc tbh. Honestly, if they end up going the Classic+ route, I'd love for specs to be expanded upon like giving disc some melee capabilities.
---
Well... Guess they were just rude then. However, its the first time ive met ppl like those this time around :)
---
That's what frost nova is for.
---
“The healing iz not as rewarding as ze _hurting_!”
---
Aren't there a ton of free infinite-respawning chests to practice on though?
---
I got into a DM group the other night and just told people straight up.  I'm a miner.  There will be mining.  They were like "Okay, cool."  
---
So we're in the instance, I wait until the mobs are all dead to mine the first node and then the second and I'm like "Sweet!" mining skill going up.  Then on the third node, the warlock starts mining.
---
I was so embarrassed.  I said, "Dude, you should have said something.  I feel like an ass right now."  
---
I forgot this is one of those things like pally auras and blessings that need to be worked out at the start of the instance.
---
Nice email and pw
---
I was able to do that but when I look in my addons folder for retail, it's now completely empty. I noticed when I went looking to upload my retail ElvUI profile to classic. I logged in to retail and it was totally stock ui. Checked addons and none loaded. Looked in the interface/addons folder under retail and its totally empty. No idea where they all went. Any suggestions?
---
Great Post, im happy that this is a pretty common History, i did something pretty similar to that but on the Horde side at Charred Vale, some Alliance were killing us while we were trying to get our Harpies quests done, The fact that the level 26+ area is so close to a lvl 33+ area me some Alliances come and farmkill us, so i got pissed after dying so many  times and started doing the very same thing you did. i went to /1 general, formed a group of 20+ hordies and stood against the Alliance.
---
At Some point i started to see people saying things like: "You guys are our heroes", and i felt like we were the protectors of these people's questing areas, i wasnt even questing anymore, i stood there just to help and lead my people to a safer questing.
---
We organized and banded toghether and even outleveled by 30+ Alliances we got our strenght in numbers and we drove em back for good that day. Great experience
---
Xiaorc-Thalnos
---
why?
---
Tel'Abim Banana sends his regards.
---
Haha I wouldn't mind that for a day... but anymore and I would get annoyed.. did you try disabling your addons? I had my weapon swing timer spamming my chat with "success" or "howdy"
---
Are you killing the Lesser Rock Elementals?  Even on my med pop server @ 2 am, their seems to be half a dozen people contesting them. 
---
I too am broke and not above grinding, but I can't find a honey hole.
---
They honestly aren't worth crafting except for skill ups. Nobody is even coming for crafts since the bags are basically selling for mats cost.
---
Mmmm, battlemage.
---
Idiot OP
---
AoE farming mages are starting to annoy the crap out of me. It's hard enough to tag some quests mobs, but when they tag ALL of them it fucking sucks. Next time it happens, I'm going to try and kite a few mobs into the blizzard when they are half way through and see what happens
---
it's a 15 year old game
---
people wouldnt have been able to level this fast if they weren't so utterly familiar with the process
---
That's an outdated method tbh.  Kids nowdays just wrap their drives in tinfoil before microwaving.  Less wet.
---
Scarlet Monastery can carry you straight to 43 if you don't mind grinding. It's roughly 32-34 for the graveyard, 34-36 for library, 36-38 for armoury, 38-43 for cathedral
---
The portals to each wing are all in one room near Undercity so you can pretty much just hang out at SM for 10+ levels
---
You have to flag for PVP as well so you won't be getting ganked hanging in front
---
I stopped trying to present this perspective to my guild, and General chat.
---
Both sides contain the same assortment of people.
---
skip it anyways
---
To keep things fresh, I rolled both new faction, new class and new professions. On retail, my main is a human rogue with mining/engineering. My main now is an undead mage with herbalism/skinning. 
---
Having to try for both quests, killing mobs, and dungeons is absolutely refreshing. I absolutely look forward to raiding and PVP from a new perspective.
---
and then everyone clapped
---
smh this shit happened to me the other day and it pissed me off so much. while questing in hillsbrad, i charged at this alliance warrior who was headed towards a troll priest. we went at it warrior to warrior except he was 3 levels above me. i watched the priest /laugh and /poke at me while the warrior went on to kill me. i then messaged him and ask him why he didnt help and all he responded was "lol"
---
i have 2 different shit lists now, one for my own faction and one for alliance.
---
It depends entirely on your stage of the game, but generally speaking, 50s and 10g ARE the same between levels 20 and 60. Both of those are basically irrelevant amounts of money at those levels. 
---
I hate to break it to you, since so many people can't grasp it, but ALL items have a value beyond whether they are usable or not. It's called vendoring or disenchanting. You act like the AH is some different monster - it's not. It's still a player being selfish. 
---
Be selfish if you want. I'll keep that in mind when I'm running anything with you, and it won't impact me, because I simply won't run with you. But don't try and justify it as something else. The very least you can do is be honest with yourself, rather than trying to make yourself feel better about being selfish.
---
only the mage though, so when he dies from inevitably pulling off (which i doubt someone who would act like that would have any self control for dps) he will sit here wondering why and you can respond with, "I don't have enough mana to use my big heals on you.
---
I played a shadow priest during the final months of pre-TBC as well as a year of TBC... I welcomed anyone trying to gank me. Typically hunters were my only real challenge. Rogues, shamans, and warriors were bound to get destroyed. Feels good having so many options at your disposal with priest
---
No you dingus, you’re rendering what altruism is. I’m attempting to let you understand the motivations for doing so.
---
Raping an 86 year old woman isn’t altruism, even if it makes you, the rapist, feel good. Helping her across the street with her groceries is, so long as you didn’t have an explicit or implicit assumption of reward to be given to you from her. 
---
Your decision to help, in that context is altruism. If you were motivated by looking good in front of your friends, the guilt you would have felt by not doing it, or knowing you would feel “good” (that pep in your step) if you did it that’s all great and dandy but it doesn’t make what you did less altruistic. 
---
Your motivations for the act only disqualify it as being altruistic if there is material or social gain to be had (and especially if said gain was the motivation for acting). Helping someone because it fills you with a sense of self worth is selfish, but it’s also altruistic—and there is nothing wrong with it being both.
---
People like you are the reason I’m actually getting anywhere with my warrior. Thank you!
---
You get one from the platinum disks behind the last boss in uldaman as well.
---
&gt; Back in the day we would take anyone and everyone to the raid just to get bodies
---
man those 40 man raid days were a tough business.
---
Yeah people were doing it during legion, it definitely has nothing to do with classic.
---
You sound salty over the gank but I do agree that the 'Go to retail' thing is just retarded and people should come up with their own shit.
---
Macros are great.
---
"Exotic Beasts" was not added to the game until WotLK. In Vanilla and TBC, any hunter can tame any (tameable) beast. :)
---
No, he's just trying to scam. He's probably got the staff as well, wants this guy to COD him the staff, but will never open the mail and it will sit in this guys mailbox for 30 days. Meanwhile he posts his staff for a higher price.
---
Hunters and warlocks get one less bag slot too, so that's fun
---
When I am feeling especially frustrated I just go full on mech suit Morty purge mode in Stonetalon Mountains.  
---
Feels good man.
---
Cite your source on pop levels? I'm pretty sure blizz is the only one to know population percentages, stay classy brah!
---
Oh, that's... something. So you'd be spending most of your time with this build as a dedicated healer in caster form? Seems like that's some heavy tradeoff in the other direction, since there are a lot of really good Restoration skills that this build doesn't take advantage of. I'll have to think about this.
---
I'm sure you do lol
---
Hopefully people are smart and see this for what it is, people that have so much regret for moving over and want others to come share in their misery
---
You're garbage bro.
---
So why dont you fight them when they come running at you with full hp and mana? Is it possible you're overextending yourself while questing and leaving yourself extremely vulnerable to the type of people who cant refrain from killing someone with almost no HP?
---
If you see someone with low HP in the area then run by them and keep an eye on them if you're going to quest in the area. Dont overextend yourself by wasting CDs or pulling recklessly.
---
We’ve been playing this over and over on peers for years. It’s nothing new for some people
---
The guy I’m responding to claimed that At War is not a feature in classic WoW. Whatever flagging may or may not be present does not change that his claim is wrong; that feature is in classic WoW.
---
Ooooo you really showed me lol
---
Retail feels like a video game to me, whereas classic feels like an old table top RPG, like D&amp;D.  By immersing myself into the feel of the character and the stories and the ambience, I’ve been able to capture that old feeling while still knowing what I’m doing.
---
I worked my profession (LW) along the way to make sure it stayed relevant, and it feels good to make a blue piece that’s exactly my level.  That’s something I didn’t even know how to do my first time through.
---
I didn’t hurry; I didn’t do things efficiently.  I’ve wasted time making friends, helping people, hunting down stupid useless things that are important to me.  I’ve developed my character the way I would a table top RPG character.
---
It sounds to me like we are playing two different games.  Good job, you won.  Does the new Madden come out soon?
---
I did that during vanilla.. 
---
Was insanely slow, 20 days played to 60 slow....
---
"oh man that is a BIG upgrade for me"
---
2 seconds after winning
---
"But not big enough to equip it"
---
Well both DKs and DHs have stolen stuff from Warlocks so I'm really hoping they're done with hero classes for a while :/.
---
If you have furor 5/5 and Feral Charge you should do   
---
#showtooltip Feral Charge  
---
/cancelform [stance:2,3,4]  
---
/cast Bear Form [nostance:1]  
---
/cast Feral Charge  
---
This macro will do the following:  
---
Always show the tooltip (and cd) of Feral Charge
---
If you are in any other form than Bear, switch to bear and do Feral Charge instantly. If you are already in Bear, just do the Feral Charge as normally you would.
---
Are you on Incendius?
---
Same time frame as OMGWTFBBQ
---
&gt; You want me to explain to you why "Healers don't even heal" is idiotic? Do you seriously think that dungeon groups bring healers for no reason at all?
---
Honestly, in a guildie premade, we don't bring healers or tanks. Just 5 DPS to blow it up as fast as possible. Efficiency is king.
---
I ran stocks with 4 PUGs last night and my healer was never below 90% mana the entire run in every group. They just sat there wanding the whole time. Myself was another story, oom the whole run, just the way I like it. Granted, no one knows how to tank either taking at most 2 mobs on at once /sigh. For the record, I gave each of those healers whatever was left of my stack of water and made myself some more. Sure in the further dungeons a healer will need to heal more, but again if the tank takes no risks, I'd rather just have a hybrid DPS toss out the occasional heal. Healing dungeons is not hard, it's a pretty boring job while you're leveling.
---
So yeah, I would like you to explain further. 
---
&gt; I didn't say anything to this mage at all. You're just angling for the "Well, I'm not going to admit you're right, so I'll just say you're rude instead" argument.
---
I've had several back and forth comments with you to come to the conclusion that you are rude - so a logical continuation is perhaps the other mage thought this as well and acted in spite. Petty? Sure, but your attitude is contagious and can go a long way.
---
Also interesting to note you're now spreading misinformation (I don't want to call you a liar at this moment). You said nothing to the mage at all? How was he even supposed to know you wanted water and were upset that you only got 4? Weird, sounds like you're expecting the mage to be a mind reader as well... sorry to inform you, priest, but that's YOUR JOB ;). In reality I've seen your other comments saying you asked the mage for water, so I'm willing to bet you said *something* to the mage. At least one of those two comments is incorrect.
---
&gt; Do you honestly think that I was able to raid without playing dungeons thousands of times? I was listing my experience with WoW. Maybe you should learn to read.
---
You're talking about raids, which is a completely different story. I have absolutely no problem expecting the mages to spend 5 minutes per healer preparing a couple stacks of water. You're experience preparing water for raids is completely irrelevant to this discussion, yet you bring it up time and time again. Learn to comprehend.
---
Dungeons are just a grind for experience while you're leveling. I'm not going to expect a mage to spend 5 minutes preparing water for a priest who won't use the water because healing a dungeon is trivial work. I'd rather, you know, start the dungeon and get the first few pulls down instead of slowing the entire group's progress down.
---
&gt; You just sound like a noob. =/
---
&gt; I was there, dude.
---
Weird. You know nothing about me yet are claiming you know everything about me. I can assure you on both quotes you've assumed incorrect things about me. This is something an unintelligent person would do.
---
I feel guilty sometimes when I deviate to gather herbs then I see what they cost on the AH and have no regrets.
---
So, what server did he end up rolling on? May I suggest Benediction, if he wishes to be a man of culture.
---
There are websites and add-ons that attempt to estimate player populations. 
---
I don't believe it's accurate, but I'd also be surprised if it turned out to be closer than 60/40.
---
Thank you if:
---
* you randomly buff other players
---
* you randomly help kill a mob you don't get count for
---
* you give away stuff like bags for free or charge low so someone can afford it
---
* you say and do nice things that you think no one notices
---
Way more readable format.
---
Based on my hopes and dreams I guess. Comparing retail servers and classic servers is silly. Just because Blizz hasn't done anything in the past doesn't mean they can't do something in the future.
---
What UI are you using?
---
If its any consolation, Puntable helped me with a quest in Redridge yesterday, seemed like a good dude :)
---
Figured it out, thanks
---
Good god what an asshole.
---
This was an iconic Strat for nef and twin emps.
---
Yis
---
I don't know if this works in Classic, but in retail the add-on Bartender lets you do this.
---
I can't speak much for end-game, as I'm still working my way there as a priest. But you can absolutely do fine healing in dungeons while you level up going completely shadow spec. I've been doing it myself, and receive nothing but constant praise of my healing abilities. As most guides tend to say, getting the improved wand talents plus spirit tap is essential for the leveling build, and the rest I dump into shadow.
---
As a proud Tauren male, I want to sing gently to him the song of my people while gently rocking the cart back and forth.
---
Yesterday I ran into a rare spawn in Duskwood, the worgen guy. He was level 33 or so and I was level 29, Prot warrior. I sat there wittling him down for like 3-4 minutes, taking potions, using all my big cooldowns. By the time I had finished him there were about 6 people standing around me in a circle watching, waiting to see if I die or finish it off. 
---
As soon as I finished they buffed and healed me totally back up. At the time I was in disbelief that they would just let me die and take the boss, but looking back I think they did it the right way. Had to earn the rare.
---
Just play the fucking game and leave politics behind dude.
---
No... because that’s how it was in Vanilla. 
---
Nobody wants 45 minute queues for BGs.
---
Probably the latter.
---
There will still be as many, or close to as many players when phase 2 hits and layering is being removed entirely.
---
So the demand for a lot of resources will stay the same, but the supply will be 1/9th, so people can just farm of a shit-ton of those valuables now that you have acess to 9x more and save them until the price will inevitably go up, because there will still be just as many players relying on those resources.
---
Yeah until ppl get their first instant DD
---
Blizzard said somewhere specifically that Layers do not affect queue times as the server itself still has a max capacity, while Layers simply instance you within that capacity.
---
In other words, there are not more cakes, there are simply more slices in one big cake that is the server. So no, queue times should remain the same if that information is correct.
---
And the mage food/water? The shaman ankh? The warlock SS? These are all auxiliary functions of the classes that are expected to be used for the group. As is lockpicking for rogues.
---
If you want locked chests for yourself, stealth through dungeons by yourself on your own time.
---
So, I had a situation where I'm not sure if I was the jerk. This guy was killing a mob right before a known quest mob and I walked up and invited him, thinking he needed the mob. He ignored the request so I just killed the quest mob and left. Should I have waited for him and let him take the mob first even though he didn't want to share via group?
---
They are not equal at all.
---
Shaman is definitely one of the more expensive ones. Warriors and rogue is very cheap.
---
You're trying to act like people who aren't AoE grouping are somehow not playing modern classic when it's been done when WoW released by competent players and before WoW was even thought. This shit isn't groundbreaking. You're not leading or following some new trend.
---
Sorry when you played vanilla you weren't competent enough to run an AoE group I guess?
---
Are you signed into a valid windows live ID in windows 10 and not just a local account on the pc? I had issues like this with a new laptop when I tried using it online at first. Would disconnect me after maybe 5 minutes everytime. I’d sign back in, same thing again 5-10 minutes after every time. Not sure if it has something to do with the OS keys or verification type stuff but maybe it’ll help lol
---
Your friends are smart, listen to them
---
I have bartender! What can I do?
---
I don't think there's anything pro about blowing 400+ mana on Blink though. Hit em with the Rank 1 Frost Nova and get back to work.
---
I’m not really an expert I just had a similar problem fixed by doing what I said in my previous post. You might want to try just redownloading your add ons and if the problem persists you might want to make a post on wow forums for help.
---
The game really is digital heroin. Hard to believe its effects were so watered down over the years that retail isn't even comparable to the high you get from classic.
---
Another option could be that in chat you'd see [SpammerName] invited you to the channel Channelaname, where if you right click spammers name you could whisper, block, report, add friend, etc.
---
TSM is a very powerful and complex addon so very few people here could give a short succinct explanation that would give enough information to be useful.
---
Classic uses TSM4 so I would start with TSM4 Tutorials. Lazy goldmaker has some guides
---
[https://thelazygoldmaker.com/the-lazy-goldmakers-tsm4-guide-part-1-introduction](https://thelazygoldmaker.com/the-lazy-goldmakers-tsm4-guide-part-1-introduction)
---
It's been 2 weeks people! Let's repeat that... 2 weeks. Everyone getting so worked up about rerolling. After you played a few months on a char, then you can start bitching about rerolls.
---
We told him he was on thin ice for the chest and then he ninjaD A BoP warrior weapon at the end. As a shaman.
---
What would be the best use of it in a raid environment? Bringing back a DPS who got himself killed restore some of the raid's efficiency, or saving it in case the tank dies and needs rezzed while the offtank buys time?
---
I've heard that the horse generally outweigh the alliance on pvp servers. I feel the same playing alliance on bigglesworth. I feel like whenever I see horde, they're always in groups of 3 too... x.x
---
Seems fast.
---
Didn't think this would ever be an issue, online people are online people. If they are ass hats they most likely will be booted, if you demand too much crap you will probably be booted. Also those guilds probably only exist for social guilds, never seen a hardcore guild advertise their LGBTQIALMNO+ diversity
---
Thanks to reckoning, I only need to land one big blow.
---
Nah its definitely Big Dick Escalator.
---
Went into retribution for levelling. Nothing in prot. Will drop a few into holy bit only after 40.
---
It is classic so you are free to try any build, 
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-paladin-leveling-guide
---
You should play a single player game.
---
TOLD ME
---
Any guild taking multiple shadow priests is the wrong guild.  Unless you only want to raid for about a month and wipe a lot
---
Almost positive poisons are not PPM, almost any rogue guide I've read says you want a faster offhand for poison application
---
Hmmmm...never heard that expression before but after googling it, does seem to apply. Thx for letting me know.
---
Does anybody actually uses q and e to strafe?
---
Arcane Warrior in Dragon Age: Origims was dope
---
As for pallies i mean they DO have the charger thing..or did... 
---
And druids it's not even lorebreaking malfurion in wc3 summoned treants for instance so totally can be done
---
The vendor now has *cooked* food. Maybe they're tired of eating raw food. Don't you ever think of their needs? :-/
---
Yep, that's the horde for you. Filthy honorless pigs.
---
Short answer: Level Shadow, respec at 58.
---
Long answer: Your build is overkill for healing dungeons while leveling. A shadow priest can heal any dungeon quite capably(granted the DPS and Tanks arent chain pulling everything.) and on top of that can do very competive dps from Shadow Word Pain and wanding *alone.*
---
*Is this build bad?*
---
Kinda, you should go down to Power Infusion since youve got so many points anyway and you should take inspiration in the Holy tree and I think Improved Renew is bad. My "Disc leveling build" would look something like this: [https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/talent-calculator/priest/6QephNtUXg4-1BmnvC-U/](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/talent-calculator/priest/6QephNtUXg4-1BmnvC-U/)
---
But as I said shadow is better till 56-58ish
---
Word.
---
My concern isnt really my class. I love everything about my hunter.
---
I'm concern about the faction and server I picked that makes me want to reroll
---
I'm with you dude. Ex-rank 13 and loved the community from that. Horde creating "toecrushersux" etc to /w abuse etc. Was always fun! Ah well for disc for that now
---
I think the situation is it's a BoE that no one needs, everyone hits greed (cause we all want money), and one asshat hits need so they get the item.
---
I had this happen to me the other night. It was a green piece of mail armor. Everyone hit greed (even the tank who was the only person able to wear mail) and this warlock in the group hit need. We noticed and called him out. He condescendingly explained that it's a little trick he learned so that he gets loot so he can get gold. I called him a ninja looter, which must have irked him because he /spit on me once the dungeon was finished until I left the instance. Needless to say I know the dudes name and will not group with him ever again.
---
Cherry on top was his friend trying to defend him and say he needed gold for a mount. I told him that was BS cause he was a Warlock.
---
*table flip*
---
This post is toxic
---
How does that work? Serious question
---
The reason there’s no Tauren rogues is because they’re already so stealthy it wouldn’t be fair
---
I totally agree. I feel that single server BGs add so much to the format that it's worth more than the convenience of cross-realm BGs.
---
I played a lot of BGs before cross-realm and it was just like you said. You had so much skin in the game to prove yourself and to take out XX player that killed you last game.
---
Cross-realm BG you aint gonna get that feeling. It's anonymous and soulless.
---
Why not introduce BGs as single server first, then add in cross-realm later? It doesn't get more Vanilla than that.
---
sadly i'm in the barrens so general chat might not work out well.
---
You know, I think I might be confusing Bartender with Dominos.  One of them had an option to move the quest tracker, it might have been Dominos.
---
CS wants to have a word with you.
---
Yeah AoE like 4 plus that you'd get in dungeon runs.
---
The only drinks for agnostics
---
I’m leveling feral and have tanked every dungeon from RFC to SM library (only level 33). You will be fine,
---
I've used a naga for years and love it. I think I'm just used to the form factor though. Build quality of razor has been iffy for a while and tend to replace one every year or two.
---
Never seen that many horses tho
---
Just tap and move along
---
- BGs release June 2005.
---
- Cross server implemented August 2006
---
- BC expansion released January 2007.
---
So Vanilla had 14 months of server only BGs, then 4 months of cross-server
---
....THE HILLS ARE ALIVE, WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC...
---
True but I'm already behind the leveling curve
---
That's true. I always just remember that PoS mace because it's what I always get.
---
I’m telling you that it doesn’t work like that. I’ve been in every dungeon up to Maraudon and at no point can I just spam demo shout and not lose aggro. The Primordial Behemoths will target dps if they aren’t sundered and revenged. Even then I have to taunt or mocking blow them from time to time. 2x Demo doesn’t hold all mobs.
---
Exactly. 2 big reasons behind the “faster attack speed is better” camp. One is the caster spell pushback in PvP and the other is the Frenzy talent. Frenzy is a proc chance when the pet crits they have a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to have 30% increased attack speed for 8 seconds. With a 1.0 attack speed vs. a 2.0 average attack speed, your attacks are all half the damage, but you have twice the amount of opportunities to trigger a crit and therefore trigger Frenzy. With the fast pets you generally only need 3 or 4 points in the talent vs. the full 5 to ensure near 100% uptime.

Horde  attempting to gank....whaaaat color me shocked.
---
That's without unnecessary upgrades. I've left the thunderclaps, demo shouts, mocking blows, shield bash's, revenge n others I can't remember off to top my head (lvl 35 now btw)
---
Gotta have fun at Phase 1 of Classic WoW while PvP Trinket isnt unlocked yet.. At Phase 2 I wont be able to cc lock 40sec anymore :c
---
Holy shit, how did I never think about this? I have a new way to troll when I get home.
---
That makes zero sense. Pvp server BGs and normal server BGs are the exact same thing. Isolating pvp servers would only cause problems. 
---
You don’t seem to get that CRBGs were done to alleviate queues. It’s how Vanilla was.
---
It is crazy how many people are multiboxing Classic, I've seen about 4 full 5mans already and I suspect countless more duos/trios.
---
hunters are a pretty easy matchup imo
---
We can start in stealth, so I usually pounce, hibernate pet + entangling root hunter. throw hots up while in dead zone and then start going to town
---
Why your boobies so far away looking like they trying to flee?
---
Yup, also if you got the time and someone else needs a fairly common drop, and I happen to roll on it, I always say I'm up for another run so they can get their item since no one else has to roll on it. I think it goes a long way in building a good reputation and possible friendships down the line. I'm just an average mage but being friendly has gotten me so many dungeon invites around lvl40 and beyond. I ran SM so much, a lot of people added me and wanted to group with me because we're all chill, mid-20's, 30s people not taking it super serious but certainly still trying. Now it's getting common to get an invite to a dungeon atleast 3 or 4 times a play session to me, which speaks volumes about how important it is to be respectful and to look at  for your fellow players!
---
&gt;You're the one worried about how other people are playing the game.
---
implying this hard.
---
i've never tried actually playing other than running to the mailbox/AH so i'm not sure. based on that little bit though i wouldn't say it's great to actually play on though. as far as just queuing up and keeping yourself active so you don't get locked out it's free, quick, and easy.
---
Trying to make me COD Warden Staff for 75g while it goes for 650g on my server.
---
Nodes are a little different for two reasons: they're solely for crafting, and the reagents are generally not worth enough to fuss over. Chests have immediately relevant loot (upgrades, pots, etc) and a decent overall worth of loot.
---
If crafting node reagents were worth the hassle, I'd vote to roll those too.
---
I highly doubt a HEALER needs Ravager. Like at that point I might as well roll on cloth whenever I want. 
---
And yeah, why wouldn't I ignore them? If I don't want to play with them in the future? Doesn't mean I'll throw it in their face.
---
I've rebound them to A and D.  I use Q and E for Skull and Square icons, respectively.
---
Ehhhh hearing the stuff people say without even knowing it. I could see some guy blurting out something that might hurt someone they didnt know was gay or whatever
---
As a Warlock tank, I appreciate your buff, shield and heals.
---
I agree. Cleave means it hits two targets, the terminology is retarded and makes me cringe every time I read it
---
The amount of mental gymnastics you’ve done to not admit that your selfishly rolling on shit you don’t need for some petty cash... If you’re so defensive about getting called out for it, I’m surprised you do it in the first place. You have to be genuinely stupid or willfully ignorant to not see how needing on stuff you don’t need would piss people off
---
Give it a few weeks. Eventually the poopsockers that are already top level with the best gear will get bored and leave, streamers that were only in it for the hype will leave and zoomers that are bored/frustrated will leave. 
---
Eventually the game will boil down to the casuals that still play decently and like the game, but haven’t figured out everything yet. 
---
I played WoW from beginning of BC til mid-Legion, and I really don’t have all that “efficiency” and doing everything the best and rightest way figured out, so I assume there’s more people like me in the middle
---
Bro bigglesworth is fucking cancer in some areas. So many horde won’t hesitate to spawn camp grief you and there’s nothing you can do because you feel so damn outnumbered. Really unfun experience
---
I played a shadow priest on a pvp server during vanilla, you should do well, the only thing I remember hating was getting one shot by rogues..
---
I was on Illidan, so not a weak server by any means. Maybe I just never saw it, or didn't spend enough time in certain zones but usually we could get around without much trouble. Pvp happened often but it was rare for me to encounter large groups of people camping certain areas for long periods of time.
---
I use a G600, its great. I have a bunch of stuff bound to mouse.
---
Fury is better but not at first. And while we can’t solo aoe we are a strong melee and we can kite mobs from pull to pull minimizing downtime. Got a kill quest? Bring the mob your killing to the next one. Farming mats or walking to a fetch quest? Fight mobs in between running to each node. Pull too much? Only swing on the first one and kite everything away till the extras reset. 
---
Master these things and not only will you stop dying as often, you’ll most likely start to over level your questing zones.
---
That’s fair- guess it’s less so “I want a hero class” and more “add some more specs to existing classes”
---
Linen cloth is worth about 28c per if you have tailoring. Linen Bags vendor for 2s and require 3 coarse thread and 6 linen cloth.
---
I made a couple starter gold by buying linen cloth for 15-20c and vendoring linen bags. I would mass craft bags while afk doing other stuff.
---
You are misunderstanding, when you are in queue, and leave queue, you still get a grace period where you can rejoin the queue and get your position back, even if you haven't logged into the CharGen screen yet.
---
Why are my clouds looking just like shit on ultra
---
Well, I mean, the first game in the series is called "Orcs vs Humans"
---
So it’s retail’s fault go figure
---
Could be either. When I play with my guildmates, we sometimes talk about IRL stuff. Where'd you and your girlfriend go for dinner last night, what does she think about how much you've been playing Classic, etc. Maybe sometimes LGBTQ folks have awkward experiences discussing these things in some guilds. Or they might have had unsavory experiences with players that have a penchant for the f word.
---
For a guild to call themselves LGBTQ+ friendly is to say that members of those communities are welcome. Maybe this is necessary, maybe it's not. I don't see anything wrong with it, though.
---
out of curiosity, why? The gold value of the items in the chest is always far higher than the loose change inside, and it's a good incentive for shifty rogues to not just say 'sorry can't pick that lock' and ninja it later.
---
You can trade bop items for three hours after the drop if you were both there for the boss kill.
---
I played on a PvE server back in the day because world PvP scared the hell out of me (I was a total noob). This time I went to a PvP server, and holy shit - the entire experience is wayyyyy better than anything I’ve ever experienced on a PvE server. The danger of world PvP is my favourite part of this game now, and imo it’s how the game is meant to be played.
---
Woops lol
---
Don't you mean amplify? 😈
---
If I remember right mc was made fairly quick. It’s why there is so much similarity in bosses. I think three or four are snake people and a couple are just bigger versions of the mobs.
---
Ugh, Now you have to worry about people reporting you for hacking. If you haven't, open a ticket to get it documented.
---
They will prabably have you delete the WTF folder.
---
Literally
---
You absolutely can open chests while in combat
---
If you actually look at that spreadsheet, you will find a section in LevelDB that has average mob healths per mob level. It does consider the raw health value when computing time to kill. So the simulation holds up to your scrutiny.
---
From a rather iconic threat analysis back in the day:
---
e) Demo Shout ftl. Demoralising shout does one sixth the threat of a sunder. Even spammed in defensive stance with defiance, you're doing no more threat than 42dps on each mob. Besides picking up whelps in Onyxia and tanking panthers in the Panther boss encounter in ZG, i can't see a compelling reason to use this.
---

Been playing MMOs since EQ, so like years, it would be easy to take the path of least resistance, the way we have been trianed to, by years of handholding MMOs but I am choosing to play the game on it's terms and it has been very rewarding. 
---
I also trying not to grind all the fun out of it. Only level 34, running minimal dungeons, doing all the quests in a zone, helping out other players, trade skilling, just having fun. Legit feels like the old  days, if you let it.
---
Retail is there if that play style is your bag, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it. For me though, I don't find it as fulfilling. 
---
Eventually Classic will devolve into how it was during those last months before BC but for now it is as fun as you allow it to be.
---
&gt; That makes zero sense. 
---
It makes perfect sense if you understand server pops and queue times. PvP servers attract PvP players, the more PvP players you have the shorter the queue times.
---
Just exit the game, happened to me. I think we disconnected from the server.. Your progress wont be lost.
---
That's a pretty childish way to look at it. Literally just the "I don't see your name written on it" argument that children use on each other. If someone is going to the trouble of clearing the mobs around it so they can pick it up, it's theirs. If you come and steal it while they're doing that, it makes you a thief and an asshole. It's like ninjaing loot from a group, there's obviously no explicit written rules against it but it's basic etiquette. Do you ninja everything you can from groups as well? After all, it doesn't belong to them if they haven't picked it up. In fact, many people consider this a form of ninjaing as well.
---
I think it was also a lot easier to build a guild roster the first few days. Now everyone is settled in their leveling guild and is fine with it. I'd think though once more people hit 60 and are looking to raid then advertising that you have raid spots open will probably help. (Assuming you're going to be raiding).
---
Also make sure you try to interact with people. People like to see convos in guild chat so you might have to be the person to start them until enough people join that they happen on their own.
---
Got a reference for that?
---
Picking up a quest item you wanted is the same general idea as burning down an orphanage? Really?
---
I’m another guy and honestly I disagree too. If it’s a boe drop item that’s group loot regardless if anyone can specifically use it. That’s how all my groups have gone naturally, though typically if someone asks for a boe they didn’t win that they can use people trade it. Despite that tho, the initial roll should always be for everyone and it’s up to the generosity of whoever wins to give it away. After all, the money does translate into gear, skills, and whatever else you need. It’s the most important resources in this game. No matter how much you belittle it, it is. A mount isn’t a luxury either. At least not anymore so than a piece of gear is or a new skill is. A mount is just as essential as all those things.
---
The same way that guy had been grinding it 20 times to use it, what if you had grinded it 20 times to sell it. Is one more evil than the other? They both want a reward, just in different forms. Both are, as you would say, a “luxury”. You don’t need that engineering schematic. You don’t need that gear. You don’t need that gold. Ffs you don’t need to play WoW. So stop talking luxury. Instead talk about value. The value of that gold to the player who grinded it for gold is equivalent to the value of the gear to the player who grinded it for gear. There is no superior value to the gear in its raw form. The gold can be turned into gear you can actually use or other high value things like a mount.
---
Yes. I have never remapped these keys, but I also have a 12 key MMO mouse.
---
You also forgot the typical “I need that cuz it has agility, I need that cuz it has mana, I need that because I just need it” bs
---
I love PVE servers. Every one is chill, the best.
---
I've played through multiple pservers and I just cant be bothered to quest right now. I main a mage so it works out for me that I get to join the spellcleaves. 
---
The dungeon grinds are also a very easy way to make gold at the start of a server because you are making gold from the game and not through selling in the AH when most people are not willing to pay for much. I made over 200g from 44-50 in zf from cloth and greens
---
I cant remember the video I watched but it was frostdamus on youtube.
---
Let me share my story.
---
I was in SM Library and as the druid healer for the run, I said to our party mage "would you be so kind as to furnish me with some mage water?"
---
At the same time I sent that message, the shaman in our group said said this:
---
"water."
---
The mage, being quite the generous soul in the end said "well at least you're nice".
---
yea it should. there are ways built in to the game so you don't have to deal with it - namely rolling on a pve server.
---
i find that hilarious though, even if i was on the receiving end of it.
---
If you are trying to optimize, sure.... But I think the point is traditional comps aren't as important to completing content when a group works well together and knows the mechanics. It's more about letting people play how they want and it's still viable to kill endgame content.
---
Psh, maybe for you. but for my buyers they are 1g per. Dont leave money on the table
---
There will be a large population of 30-40 characters for at least another 2 months yet, so don't expect to get good prices for anything low level for a long time.
---
I'm sensing a decent amount of logic coming from OP .. Inb4 he gets hated on for it.
---
I mean my raid guild looks to be forming the opposite way a majority rogue and warrior because that seemed to be what everyone rolled we have like 2 consistent healers atm. Raiding is months out for us. So I’m using my head start to gear get epic mount level an alt. I don’t need to rush raids they aren’t going anywhere.
---
Bonebiter was very tempting, but I had to have a decent tanking weapon.
---
LGBTQ+ friendly guilds are specifically for the mentally ill
---
I assume rogues have leveled lockpicking.
---
Other than this, I can’t think of many reasons to get a rogue over another mage.  Similar damage, much better aoe, can sheep anytime, has food/water/int,blink,frost nova.
---
I've heard &lt;1% multiple times.    
---
There was some Blizzard interview were I think they were talking about the implementation of LFR. They were saying how they spent a lot of time and money making these raids with developers and artists, only to have so few people do them. Vanilla Naxx was their go to example of something they never wanted to happen again. It was a huge waste of resources at the time.
---
Let me try to break it down for you with an example...
---
A BoE drops worth 50g. It’s always on the AH for 50g and sells frequently at this price. One person in the party could use it. Why give all 50g to that one person? Everyone in that party deserves a fair shot at the share in that item it’s basically rolling on 50g. If the person who needs it doesn’t get it, if they need it that badly they can farm the golf and buy it. Or they could wear it for a few levels then vendor it after getting an upgrade. This is why everyone should hit need when a BoE drops worth anything. If you want to play the game like that cool but don’t expect others too and certainly don’t refer to them as assholes just because they want their fair share of a profitable item they helps acquire.
---
Tanks
---
You fuckin nailed it.
---
You got a free name change with the transfer by making a character on the targeted server with the same name.
---
Hey guys. How are warriors tanking dungeons past SM? Like I’m a warr myself but every dungeon I had been doing it was common to just two hand tank for the damage. But I’m about to do zulfarrak and then maraudon so I was curious if that style is still used or do I need to get my weapon skill up for sword/board?  Thanks
---
It does work, you just need to let it scan the auction house first. Then it will show prices, but only based on the most recent scan.
---
Do the steam phone app thing that’s how I’ve been leveling up my fishing
---
It became political the day those groups made it a political issue.
---
The solution is everyone needs on boes of rare or higher. That way nobody is a ninja. If you needed the piece as an upgrade tough shit you are a fool for equipping it.
---
True, probably why I played DK for so long. Only thing about DK is that, like most WoW classes has a certain class fantasy and lore that leads me to view it as something else. I guess the beauty of DnD is that it can you can play a character however you really want and have it be whatever you want to get the right feel for it.
---
When u consistantly been 92 killos weight and during maintenance u check u are down to 85 cuz u skip 66% of meals and sleep
---
What is the money maker from them? The elemental earth's are only like 25s on the ah on my server, what makes them better than grinding the rock elementals in arathi that have 0 people ever at them?
---
except is always on, and for less buff
---
Copy and pasta the convo they gave you. thats the only way any of us can give you a proper response that could be helpful
---
Imagine a horde only spec too, as if they aren't already blatantly favored.
---
But then the social threads binding society together, composed of people spamming lfg macros in 4 chat channels will degrade. We might as well be playing retail! /s
---
I also hesitate to say the imbalance is severe but it’s starting to feel that way to me, at least 30+.
---
I'm a Hunter and I have been trying so hard to not steal gear from other people that need it more I'm level 38 and still using a level 16 sword
---
More like the third? Crusade got one, APES second raid group and now Asmon
---
Have someone on another layer invite you to a group. You will join their layer. It's basically like an instanced version of the zone you are in, so mobs/ore/herbs/players will all be different. 
---
There are addons that facilitate this and make layerhopping easier but just get some different guildies to invite you to a group a couple times until you find whatever you're looking for.
---
Layering will be removed in the future supposedly, so this won't be possible forever.
---
That line hit me.
---
Oh yeah because you can ALWAYS find the BoE you need for the same price as whatever BoE’s you happen to get! Lol what a joke
---
Depends on the intent when you say it. Words don't really carry the same weight when they aren't being used for their direct meaning. Guild members are gonna drop f boms and n bombs but unless they're directing at someone who they *know* will take offence then I can't see a problem.
---
You're wasting your time, just re-roll before it's too late.
---
It's not fear mongering - it's people trying to help people from making a HUGE mistake
---
The hype is over.
---
Not gonna lie, one of the things I miss about not playing rogue is running around SM pickpocketing and soloing bosses.  Can make a lot of gold pretty quick.
---
As far as Phase 1 is concerned, most people pre-raid BiS gear is mostly blues, so most people should be able to clear phase 1 raids in blues...
---
Other than that, I agree. It's not a stigma, like OP calls it, it's mathematical fact. Assuming equal gear and skill, hybrids are no match for a pure DPS.
---
No, I just snag quest items and tags because I value my time and the time of the irl friends I'm playing with over some internet randos. Hell, I've greeded upgrades because they were a bigger upgrade for people I'm playing with, but I must be an asshole because I walked past you fighting a dude to pick up some random quest item that I actively need and then buffed you for the trouble.
---
Unless you wanna AoE spam dungeons, LFG and World are basically useless, if you want to run dungeons normally, you need to use local (city) or trade chat.
---
Jesus you’re ignorant.
---
The sword it makes is godly for tanking and rogue/fury damage. For tanks it’s just insane. It increases their threat immensely. The damage is because of the proc which is why even rogues used it in their main hand despite it being so fast.
---
Whatever man, you started this conversation by describing yourself as the medical definition of sociopathy and I'm still confused about what you're overall trying to get at, at this point. I don't really care anymore what label you want to put on the act of picking up a piece of trash in an empty public restroom, live however you want.
---
Anyone in group can loot an item off a boss mob. Things off of common mobs (like bear butts or lieutenant's insignia) not so much.
---
Lots of people want to get 'a hit' on a node for the skill-up alone, so they'll take a hit for that. My brother let a horde take a hit on an iron node in Badlands last week ("I guess it's okay if he gets a hit") but then he got greedy and tried taking another, and as soon as it happened my brother and a random paladin nearby killed him for it. I didn't assist because I thought it was dumb, but it's a valid reason someone might rush up and try to mine it at least once.
---
THE
---
&gt;You are already called me and everyone else who rolls need on trade items a dick. 
---
If you bothered to read the name as well as the post, before going off on strangers over the internet, you would notice that I am not the user you were originally responding to.
---
&gt;Instances are a viable way to farm for gold and these BoE items are so unlikely to drop that nobody is farming an instance specifically for those to drop. Most people have to buy them off the auction house.
---
A very convenient line of thinking for someone who wants to justify rolling need on any and all BoE.
---
Bro when you smelt it you can stack to 20. He trying to make bag space.
---
"The player looking for that particular item may have ran that dungeon for the 20th time specifically to get it. Its a huge upgrade for his class and it finally drops. And you come by and need it because you can get gold for it on the AH when people start twinking."
---
What BoE items fall into this category? Usually these are BoP items. The v expensive BoEs are typically world drops. You pug BRD for your HoJ, not your edgemasters. This actually plays into why everyone should need. You didnt come to this dungeon because you needed some random world drop. You came for the BoP boss drops.
---
These world drops are so rare its basically impossible to farm the one you need.  And you do need them, edgies/warden/weapons are BiS. So you NEED to buy them. So you NEED gold.
---
Know the value of things and nab them off the AH and resell them. Yesterday I grabbed a tailoring recipe for 15 silver that has a .4 percent drop rate and makes a key item, and sold it for 8 gold two hours later.
---
Seems a bit unrealistic to expect a 80% dropoff in players over the next few months right?
---
Wait really I respecd yesterday and got charged 1 gold!! wtf
---
Spam sunder armor. Oh damn not enough rage? Use blood rage or whatever to get some free rage and press that sunder armor. You don’t anything else pretty much on low lvls. Of revenge procs do revenge, until then just sunder armor
---
Thanks for draining your mana and taking extra drinking pauses just to help random people, /u/Cuddlefucket
---
Bro i thought this was real and actually was excited to play retail until i read "just for fun"
---
Every time a battlemage or spellsword build is discovered, Blizz kills it.  Dual FT on fast weapons for shamans in LK, mages with high spellpower and a certain dagger for massive melee arcane dmg in BC, shockadins (though it took Blizz several expansions to figure out how to kill them), and others I'm either forgetting or not aware of...all have resulted in Blizz saying "No you can't play that way you're doing it wrong!"
---
@wedgies! and all the people of Azeroth! It is fixed! I am in the queue waiting to be born with my new vanilla character! Let the merry news spread! Thanks to you alot Wedgies for your personal effort and guidance. They have solved it on their side as you predicted! I am happy!
---
Yes, death is for the horde.
---
Ahh, I see
---
GW2 did this with Sword/Dagger Elementalists and they're considered one of the most fun specs in the game. FFXIV just failed at designing their spellblade class.
---
Is that a Wireshark?
---
Get Auctionator. It will automatically undercut for you.
---
Do you have your defensive stance? You will get abilities that lets you keep aggro and regain aggro. You need a one hander and a shield too and you can pull mobs, use sunder armor to keep them on you while your dps kill them
---
https://youtu.be/uvdzhU50YB8 
---
watch this short clip from where to invade next if you wanna be salty
---
And here I am lvl 55 warrior going and once I ding 60 we make a hunter for farming lol.
---
What's that?
---
It's a very 3rd grade move, super mature.
---
Nope.
---
Trying to measure a feral dps to a rogue or a boomkin to a mage is so close minded...
---
That’s why Blizzard made the roll icon for Need a gold coin! Right??
---
Not grabity?
---
&gt; but i do need the gold
---
So click the icon that looks like a pile of gold.
---
You're gonna be alright dude. You'll easily get another party if you wanted. The server didnt blacklist you. The people from the group probably dont even remember your name. Were you losing aggro? Was the dps not targeting your target? Did the heals suck? Move on try again
---
Understand how your taunt works. Taunt itself generates no threat, it simply puts you on top of the person who currently has the most amount of threat. If you charge and then taunt the mob immediately it will do nothing.
---
You need to use your abilities that say "generate a high amount of threat," like sunder armor and heroic strike to build up threat on the mobs. If you do lose aggro, that's when you taunt.
---
I meant the other half
---
So every class has the exact same spells at max level? You dont get to pick and choose different ones from a tree?
---
Is it common that MT gets first Thunderfury? (Because aggro)
---
"I only ninja when it isn't against my friends" doesn't make you look any better.
---
Unfortunately classic is plagued with people like you (those who don't attack opposing faction ever). You know there are PvE servers... Like how do you let one member of an opposing faction peacefully quest in the middle of 10 players?? Like wtf... You just kill the guy and teach him a good lesson that you aren't his friend but rather his enemy. The amount I see this on Skeram is mind boggling. I make sure to do my part by killing them all.
---
There was a picture of a pug group on here that got one
---
Walking up and picking up a quest item I need isn't an extremely shitty thing to do.
---
I am a rogue with skinning. They'll be fine without me.
---
He's making a joke about when Asmong will get his second binding.
---
He should be levling instead of killing horde
---
That’s false dude there’s plenty of homophobia spouted all across WOW and some folks just want to feel more comfortable
---
I am finding it funny people are trying to justify servers dying or being empty but the only time they show any data are during non-peak hours when most people are at work or school.
---
He means asmon will get his second half in 2021
---
We could always use some human leather hats.
---
You look like someone who mains Mercy
---
Go on...
---
That's where I got the idea tame a pet to try and tame Ech.  The guildie gave me the name Orcbane because I couldn't remember the Orc's actual name.
---
Noice
---
Every single PvP server is horde dominated lol. Not a single one is alliance heavy. The most balanced two seem to be Sulfuras and Stalagg where it’s like 55% horde to 45% alliance. Compared to others that are now 70% horde 30% alli
---
&gt; Its just a retail mentality being brought into classic where it doesn't belong,
---
Your gatekeeping is leaking, and you're making a _lot_ of baseless assumptions. I played vanilla extensively, raided a lot, and learned quite a bit about the game. I'm pretty good at it. But that 90g for a skeleton horse isn't gonna farm itself, and spellcleave is radically faster than traditional dungeoning.
---
Vanilla, if anything, was about a lot of experimentation and using novel approaches to account for non-traditional comps. How in the world is _not using a traditional tank at all_ not in this same vein?
---
what do you mean you don't have the time? If you run one or two dungeons per week you'll eventually get there
---
Left + right = big sword. Big sword good
---
Meant to respond to the person above. But yeah. There's a ton of 'GAH' in this thread.
---
Shaman ftw!
---
I saw some threads on forums about ele in raid gear. Lack of regen in combat and inside 5sec rule are the main killers. Apparently most bosses have less base nature resist than shadow or frost resist, to the point of being same resist -after- the curse lowering resists. I didn't save the source and i personally plan on staying enhance and swinging a Nightfall for my pve content.
---
My question is.... given enough spell dmg/penetration/crit even if half the gear is cloth... could down ranking to like rank 6 or 7 provide enough effeciency? Max ranking for burn phase and clear cast procs, that is one thing I havent seen talked about. Granted I think CL ends up being a better use for clear casts.
---
No they won't. This is why we have shitty tech like Xrealm. They refuse to close dead realms and just virtually link them with other servers. They have not closed a server in 15 years.
---
wouldnt be so nice if it was LFR and they aren't on your server so you can't tell the world how much huge assholes they couldve been
---
You've been playing with the wrong people apparently. I don't think anyone has come remotely close to out-damaging a warrior with sweeping strikes in any run I've done in SM. Maybe a mage on a massive pull, but not at all in regular groups.
---
imagine being this mad
---
Yeah, except he is going to take Eye of Sulfuras as well. Screw that cancer raising.
---
Same vendor greys off of the ones in arathi though, I guess maybe the backpack chance is a big deal? Hardly seems worth it with how many people.i constantly see there
---
Grid is good but I can't remember if it communicates incoming heals with other raid members. If so, great. If not, healing bot does.
---
What this does is let you see what people are being healed by others so you don't start casting a heal on them too.
---
That's not what I was stating, I was questioning why streamers are okay with this mentality of being given loot.  He decided he was going to MT, because Thunderfury naturally, and boom it happens.  No gearing up, no working your way up a guild rank, no recruiting, no applying.  You instantly skipped many steps everyday players have to take to get to that point, I'm just asking how someone can find this rewarding is all.
---
Wolves, and that's classic warlock for you :)
---
When I was soloing MC on my warrior I got both bindings in 2 runs.
---
Statistical randomness is just that.
---
PSA: Wow is a social “team based” game.
---
Rogues provide next to no benefit that any other class can do, and do better with more benefit to the party.
---
Rogues compete with tank for gear.
---
Rogues don’t top DPS
---
Rogues don’t buff
---
They don’t summon items
---
They don’t heal the party.
---
They don’t tank.
---
They barely can CC.
---
They are already lowest priority on the “DPS” list.
---
Get bartender. It can do all of this way better.
---
Listen man I don't like asmon one bit. I don't even watch streamers but you just sound salty. To say he hasn't put in work to get where he is today is insane. He obviously has put in tons of effort to get to where he is today. It's not like he was born a famous streamer he had to grind and promote and practice to get there.
---
Why do any of you give a shit.
---
I honestly miss some of the new spells in retail, that rogue teleport ability is just kickass!
---
Imagine my life as a Druid in a past life trying to get Warden Staff, my bis up until Naxx. It never dropped on my server and made its way to the AH. Never in 14 months of playing and daily checking (both my checks and my guild’s on my behalf) did it ever appear on the AH. And it never dropped for me. Can you imagine how unfair it would be for you to scoop it up as, say, a rogue and then ransom me for it? 
---
Not every blue or purple that drop while leveling warrant arguing about. But in bis situations, or situations where leveling could be drastically accelerated due to a boe drop, my example should make it clear that needing for greed is the socially wrong thing to do. Whether your game theory approach is technically correct or not shouldn’t matter because this is a social game based upon reputation. If you needed on my warden staff “fOr GoLd” you would be instantly blacklisted by my whole guild and called out by dozens of people in game and on forums.
---
In a perfect world, men like me would not exist. But this is not a perfect world.
---
It was like that back in the day too. #nochanges
---
Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

i'm a rogue, not a warrior, so i'm not sure if it's different for you, but [thrash blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17705/thrash-blade) is the next big upgrade i'm going for. it's from a quest in maraudon.

As a Mage, I'll need on something that nearly doubles my armor in that slot, but because it offers a +2 Strength and +2 Spirit, people chew me out. I'm planning on using this piece, for a long long time.
---
Am I doing it wrong?
---
I'm currently maining a rogue and really enjoying my time, but I'm already excited to start my alt. I've been thinking about what class would be best to have as an alt, and right now I'm kind of leaning towards warlock. Do you guys think it's a good idea to have two purely dps toons, or should I roll someone who can either tank or heal? I'm also thinking about going priest, although I've always loved shamans (my rogue is alliance though so that probably won't happen). Should I just play whatever sounds most fun or will I hamper myself by not being more diverse?
---
I just rolled on another server, leaving my lvl 29, a 26, and a hundred gold
---
Frankly, I'm feeling great
---
I'm about to start playing this way. Seems like it would increase immersion
---
This was like a breath of fresh air to read. Thank you
---
WTF you genius.
---
Ah yeah good idea, I'll alter my pricing accordingly.
---
It's a tank weapon, and he's main tank of his own guild lol. He's the only one there it should go to.
---
My time is infinitely more valuable to me than yours. The thing is, you probably think that your time is infinitely more valuable to you than mine, or you wouldn't really care that I'm wasting time that you're already wasting playing WoW.
---
Bloodvine won't be available til like p4 (whenever ZG comes out)
---
He's MT... and the other warrior who competes for MT is okay with it. That's not even taking it... not like he's fury and ninja looted it.
---
With the leveling revamp you get way more choice on where you level.  Up to 60 is pretty much any of the routes in in Azeroth.  At 60 you can do BC or WotLK.  At 80, Cata or Pandaria.  At 90, you burn through it in about two hours.  Things slow down a bit in Legion, but you can do those zone in any order.  Then you're at the current content.  If you *like* leveling, then its an enormous improvement over what it was two years ago.  I've done all the allied races and enjoy seeing how fast I can get through it all.  If you're bummed out by the leveling it's gonna suck no matter what.  
---
They also revamped the way professions work.  They break down by expansion now.  So you can start at 0/175 BfA as soon as you hit 110.  Vanilla is still 1-300.  All the other expansions have a 1-150 skill range.  Not ideal, but a good patch for people who hated having to level from 1-600 just to get to current content.  
---
The game is entirely designed about getting you right back to the thick of it as quickly as possible.  Otherwise I understand your point and WoW should try a little more horizontal progression.
---
Hate this mentality. It’s greed trying to justify need. It’s not need tho. Need is equipable upgrade.
---
I never played WoW on release so this was my first time. I had played WC3 and I loved Thrall and Rexxar in the campaign. Founding Durotar in the campaign and seeing it come to life in WoW was a really awesome feeling of nostalgia

Warlock starts around 42-45.

"Has all but" is a really weird phrase in English, it basically means that it's so close that it has basically already happened, or it is only a short moment from happening. Honestly a really confusing phrase especially for people who don't have English as a mother tongue.
---
It does, even when talented, but you can use it when pulling. Worse than sheep etc. but still a cc, and it has its uses.
---
Right?! I have been farming mc for 6 months and only got one...
---
Honestly, you could add a queue to the meeting stones, have it queue you for that dungeon.
---
Hold onto it for 6-12 months until the economy matures and there is a healthy supply of gold to be spent on frivolous items like pets.  Should be an easy couple thousand gold by then.
---
I'm gonna spam general, world, lfg, *and trade chat* :)
---
It’s a low drop rate, but a chance is a chance. It doesn’t change based on your first run or several runs through.
---
Do the gouge and kick mouseovers cause you to lose CP on your current target?
---
I'm meaning the cities and cultures. Horde is more "grr. Me smash" while alliance is more pomp and glamour.
---
On the other hand I've gone out of my way to do things for people I really didn't have to do and it hasn't paid off at all. Just a few days ago a group agreed to need BOEs since they're sellable and I've had people ninja them on greed. I didn't even bring this up, someone else did and I was the group leader.
---
Lo and behold a BOE drops that a damn good twink weapon and will sell amazingly in the future and everyone needs except 1 person who apparently was high as fuck. I told him to roll and he won and no one gave a shit. Should have just kept the thing. Being nice in this game hasn't paid off for me at all and no one's going to remember scummy shit or care about things like that once time goes on.

Nope lol, druids just have some of the same style of damaging abilities. A feral druid still has all the core tools a balance and resto druid have.
---
Bags .
---
Always when dealing with a rogue toss that DoT up as soon as possible so if they break combat they cant just restealth on you. PvP as a caster is fun but can be a bit intimidating as the whole idea is to keep them away from you as much as you can to avoid stun locks or spell cancels (goes with any melee class you engage). 
---
That being said I played priest back in the day and I would always toss up shadow word and try to get the first mindblast off before I feared that way you can get the mind flay going while they are feared and after the first mind blast. 
---
You're going to have to find your formula but the best thing you can do it keep them away from your soft squishy cloth body. Swiftness potions and stuff help too if you're having a really bad time.
---
On Fairbanks as well...It's bad, every website is showing a heavy imbalance.

---
If I'm in a quest hub, I try and pass out mage food to warriors.
---
I think I'm your opposite. Leveled a warlock to 30, got a druid from 1-28 by the time I got to 32 on my lock. He's getting parked indefinitely. Druid is so fun! Although in my case idgaf what I end up showing up to raids as because pvp is my favorite part
---
What’s it do? I’ve always wondered.
---
Tell me more
---
I'm going to go back to playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure!
---
Factions specific specs is a great idea wow.
---
Why aren't you using a pet??
---
Yeah iam super jelly with my holy priest over here.. i always aim for legendaries that dont exist in classic for my class. Iam 32 bro
---
Iam just stating a fact.. its an AD
---
Mob randomly respawned and he was a good 30y off the spawn attacking another mob. I had no idea he was going for it until I saw a dot pop up mid charge. At which point it’s not feasible to stop attack and let him tag, hoping he invites me. I just target him and invite. 
---
Unfortunately, I am not psychic. 
---
Do you expect me to whisper everyone in the zone and confirm they are not trying to kill the same mob?
---
Ok but does that change anything about what the guy above said?
---
It's not really stealing is it. Kinda dickish but he earned it too.
---
Well theres a few reasons why I consider cenus important 
---
1 come phase 2 and layering stops how much more empty will my faction look like in the world
---
I already cross 4 horde for every 1 alliance in the open world.
---
2 months down the line and the hype as worn off and the ones who couldn't cut it during level quit...what's my faction going to look like?
---
As of right now it looks like theres going to be maybe 3 or 4 guilds on alliance whitemane that will even see Naxx
---
My whole goal is to get t3 and pvp with it. Wpvp and bgs.
---
I'm not too worried in the bg department but even now I cant pvp 1 horde player without 4 more simply passing by and try to help their fellow hordie.
---
Yeah I know. But I just like having the tools and using them. Being able to drop a Frost Resist totem vs. a Mage is pretty awesome, dropping a taunt totem followed by a fire nova totem when fighting a group, or being able to drop a poison cleansing totem when fighting spiders in a group.
---
I did BG's to rank 10 in Vanilla and cross realm battlegrounds were definitely a thing. I was so glad when they came out because queues were fast and AV's actually popped instead of waiting for 6 hours before giving up. And my server wasn't even low population.
---
Its a story as old as wow itself. Every person on every pvp server thinks the other side has more people. Until there's some established census data its nothing more than a guess.
---
Unpopular opinion, but i fell out of love with the Rift talent system. I liked the “tree and root” system they had where your spells were unlocked based on how far into a tree you went, but there were so many talent trees that did so many different things for each “class” that you started losing identity, which i think the classic WoW players want to see.
---
When a cleric joined the group, i would originally think “cool, a healer...” but then they would talk about actually being a tank spec mainly. Then i would thing “cool, so like a prot paladin or some shit”. Then they would talk about also taking a damage tree and so they would be doing both tanking and some damage. It felt like every “class” could do everything all the time and it just ended up being “find a group of X players to do this”. 
---
Now i can see why some people like this theory of class building where you dont have to wait forever spamming LF tank for X dungeon, and maybe i just prefer the old fashioned holy trinity (or the four archtypes of dps, tank, healer, cc) but it never clicked with me.
---
As long as you have aggro they can still open the chest though...
---
Dude listen to what we are telling you. We been seeing this for 15 years now, we KNOW how blizz handle this issue. If EF becomes dead they will implement paid char transfers and then wash their hands of it. "They thought they did, but they didnt see?" will be the only internal conversation they have about it. EF will NOT be merged. You will NOT get offered transfers to better realms. You are gonna be waiting for them to allow you a paid transfer or your gonna be rerolling and just writing off your assets on EF. 
---
 No one here is trying to attack you, we are trying to help you.
---
Charge, sweeping strikes, change to berserker, rage, WW, cleave, cleave, whirlwind. Can easily take 3-4 mobs
---
Well there you go then
---
Outside of Ironforge as well. Its both.
---
For real. Living cooped up in an urban area, playing WoW gives an awesome calming, hiking-like feel sometimes. I sometimes just stop questing for a bit, look around at the beautiful scenery, and then get ganked in the ass by a night elf hunter.
---
Having a reasonably "up to date" 1h and shield will make a world of difference for your healer, especially when you're using shield block properly too. But, like the other poster said, if your healer is cool with it and you aren't having any issues, do whatever you want
---
Who. The. Fuck. Cares?
---
maybe if you’re zooming in..? i’ve got my graphics set to 7 or somethin. Could be from the filters but it’s pretty true to the game image
---
If they're in your party then you'd be better off finding new guys to quest with
---
I mean yeah it’s “not stealing” but it’s a fuckin dick move.
---
That's what I had thought(after your correction), but the devilsaur stuff is still actually tribal.  It wasn't entirely clear.
---
yo, what's the buff addon and does it have a debuff component?
---
Highly doubt it's world first
---
I got 3 bindings in 6 runs when I farmed old shit on retail, and I've got 3 warglaives from bt in a dozen runs.
---
And two ashes of alar in less than 15 runs.
---
I'm not saying this to brag.  I'm saying RNG is RNG.  Not everything in life is a conspiracy, you know.
---
Blizzard is seriously fucking retarded. Implement some hard caps for overpop faction and give a few incentives to roll for underdog. This shit aint rocket science.
---
is it possible to configure the ClassicAuraDurations addon to show countdowns of my CC/debuffs even if i click off my target?
---
Or any addon that can do it?
---
Nice, is it a separate addon in the interface menu so I can just prevent it from loading period without affecting Auctioneer's other functions?
---
I'm petty as fuck.  Last night I was killing the Murlocs outside of Lakeshire.  I had just intentionally pulled two so I could use my Evasion on them.  I've got the first one a little over halfway dead, and this druid takes the other one from me, wasting my Evasion.  Yes, I know I could have tagged both of them, but I really wasn't concerned with having my mobs poached.  He and I were the only ones around, and there were plenty of Murlocs for both of us.
---
About 3 minutes later a group of 3 Murlocs respawned right on top of us.  He aggro'd them, in addition to the one he was already fighting.  I pulled a Murloc standing off on his own, killed him and got my last fin, and then ran right through the druid as he was getting beat to death by the remaining 3 Murlocs.  I panned the camera around behind me so I could watch him die as I left.  I don't feel bad about it.
---
Yup. I recall the gear treadmill in vanilla, where mid-tier raiding guilds were mixed between casual players and serious players. The casual players would struggle with non-optimized builds and poor gear and make very slow progress. The good players would go from UBRS gear to the low-tier guilds, and then after a month or two of getting geared up, go to the mid-tier guilds. Then they'd get mostly caught up to the current tier and move on to the progression guilds. Those lower-tier and mid-tier guilds tended to flounder for a long time because of their (well-intentioned) attempts to allow less optimized setups. Not that they aren't viable, or that players these days aren't better-informed, but I think it's going to be a struggle for a lot of casual raiding guilds.
---
You see a quest item on the ground. There's a mob next to it. You start blindly fighting the mob crossing your fingers that you'll get the item.
---
I see a quest item on the ground. There's a mob next to it. I look around in all directions and analyze the situation. "If I aggro this mob, is anyone about to nab my quest item? If so, what can I do to prevent it? Can I disable the mob and nab the item using a class skill? How about some magic dust or a net trinket? Can I bait the lurking player in to nabbing aggro first so that I can get my quest item? What is the best way to handle this situation and not be a victim?"
---
Yes, this is actually how situationally aware players like myself approach challenges in WoW.
---
Real LPT right there.
---
Step 1 as a hunter.. Get a pet. A warrior is no replacement for a pet. No matter how much you want them as a pet.
---
No because the need button is the only way to ensure a fair roll on valuable blue items
---
He's clearly already mentioned he's using bartender. So yes, there is. I believe under the "visibility" tab for the corresponding bars. Not sure on the exact placement of the option as I'm not home right now but I know for a fact I saw it while I was fiddling with mine last night.
---
He’s probably still enjoying the game more than you
---
It does not, but it also does not change the fact that he was GIVEN all that because he's a streamer.  He didn't work for it, so it removes the feeling of accomplishing something, that was my only point.
---
Who stands on a fence?
---
Which blizzard said are wildly inaccurate due to how the results are parsed from a /who
---
No, but my guild guy a congratulations tweet on server first Ragnaros kill :)
---
I know it seems hard to belive to someone levelig vanilla for their first time, but I have played "vanilla" for years on private servers and I went into this with a very hardcore attitude and four other dedicated players from a guild with the intent to kill ragnaros on week one. I had a very different approach to the game than the average.
---
I used to use a Razer Naga for years and loved them although I had two stop working on me (one was dropped on the floor a few times due to my poor cable management). Was looking into getting a G600 after that, because of Logitechs quality, but I stopped playing MMOs for awhile. I bought a Logitech G502 instead and it's amazing but I think i would still prefer the 12 thumb buttons for a MMO. I feel it made me a better player.
---
I used the 12 thumb keys along with Shift, Ctrl and Alt as modifiers to make it a 48 thumb key mouse! (1 - =, Shift 1 - =, Ctrl 1 - = and Alt 1 - =).
---
no moo LOOOL

Ape's B-Team got one on Garr aswell https://clips.twitch.tv/HappyLivelyWalrusDerp

I downvote and block everybody who links his videos for a reason... enjoy that list :)
---
Build a macro and a assign a key to it. 
---
/run SetRaidTarget("target", 8) for skull I think
---
This is why I made all the classes that interest me and I freely switch between them to play what I am currently enjoying. I am in no rush to max out and having multiple characters is great when you just get frustrated by the zone you are in or a quest you are trying to complete or because enemy faction is camping you.
---
Thought about that, i mean.. thats like top notch suspicious
---
Scroll through the keybinds menu and you should find it.
---
Im calling hax. No way does your fear actually make them run away from you everytime.
---
 You're telling me not one wolf just stopped infront of you, ran 3 feet to the left stopped. Ran 4 feet behind you and stopped. Then ran 2 feet the right and fear ended. I just dont believe its possible.
---
&gt;Maybe that should be a hint that your use of language is incorrect? That's how most people realize they're misusing a word or phrase.
---
Seeing as my comment in the positive it would seem that people understood what I was getting at and agree, so I disagree with you on that.
---
&gt; Of course, with how you've responded so far, I expect you to instead ask  me why I'm throwing a fit or why I'm bothering to engage with you about  this at all. You know, standard deflection. 
---
Because I made a snide comment I'm deflecting and apparently now a "serial throw-a-fit accuser"? Our lives must be very very different for you to draw such conclusions. Either way thank you random reddit psychologist for seeing through the whole of my being.
---
go into the kitchen and grab a snack, do you want anything?
---
He did. That's actually part of the story. And then for some reason blizzard threw rogues in to the mages basement.
---
LOL
---
There's also a very real chance in my opinion that in a year player numbers have dropped significantly enough for Blizzard to decided it's not worth developing further, and just leaving a few 'Classic' servers up in maintenance mode for anyone who wants to play on them whenever they wish. People seem to forget that *is* a potential option when talking about the future, and only acknowledging BC Classic, or Classic+.
---
You: "durr im retarded durrrh"
---
Everyone: "nobody cares be quiet"

You "obviously you care since u replied duurrhhhh"

Smooth brain level argument on your part.

This only works if they cancel the trade. If they don't click anything or accept the trade, they will continue opening the chest/gathering node.

LET SHAMANS TANK
---
Atleast its a dungeon drop you can farm for and not a lock out bis item.
---
When it comes to MMO design, increasing the level cap is a trap if you ask me.
---
Vertical progression inevitably requires catchup mechanics, inevitably renders old content obsolete. It
---
somethings wrong with you guys
---
Arugal?
---
What you said. But you can shorten the macro by replacing all 'cast' with 'use' and removing spaces between the closing square bracket and ability name
---
I do this by habit because it gives me more room down the line to add trinkets etc without hitting the character limit so soon
---
I've noticed this with cloth (I'm a tailor so I buy lots to flip and profit from). You'll see say linen listed for like 40c a pop. But if you actually check the ah frequently you'll notice people list it for cheaper but it sells fast. That expensive cloth just sits there and expires. But then people in chat are like "selling linen for 39c, cheaper than ah price". And it's like, well yes, but actually no.
---
you do have double the spell you actually, regularly use.. and a bunch of defensive and offensive CD you have to weave in.
---
you don't have the maybe once per week random crap like track dragonkind or eye of the beast.
---
I have only heard of it as a cat thing, I might be wrong :)
---
Khruangbin, Nujabes, FKJ, Tom Misch, Phum Viphurit, Elephant Gym, Thundercat, Flylo.... the list goes on forever.
---
Where did you get MikScrollingBattleText? I can't find the classic version at all.
---
Can you link me the Whitemane discord?
---
Why? After many years of addons I've realized the #1 priority is to not hog the screen with duplicate, flashy information.
---
Pretty sure they stated it was supposed to be 16 no?
---
First off you need to treat your pet like you would a tank in a dungeon. 
---
Send in your pet and let it attack for a couple seconds before you start attacking.
---
DO not use your abilities on CD if you do, your pet will lose aggro and you will run out of mana. 
---
Dont move unless it is to get out of melee range.
---
Be patient.
---
F?

According to Wowhead, the quest turns green at 51, and USUALLY, quests give less rep as soon as you hit green. I'm not sure if this applies to repeatable quests. I'm level 51 right now actually trying to grind out Darnassus rep as well so I'll try this when I get home and update you.
---
Agreed. I'm definitely not a fan of Asmond and especially the horde of cultists he has. But the bindings should absolutely go the guild's main tank, which he is.
---
imagine being this bad a shaman lol. couldnt even get a mage with no mount. And he is a clicker.
---
Also, I need the BoP for vendor.
---
Gotta train weapon skills. Alliance mace trainer in ironforge
---
You have to go to a weapon trainer at level 10 and spend 10s to learn the skill.
---
I said boe blues for a reason
---
I always fully loot the chest and throw away the garbage. Nothing worse than opening a chest and finding just bread.
---
I'd def throw in dismounting into the macro. Very helpful, just like me using cancel form setup on druid. Saves a key press
---
The rebuff limit should be 16 I think
---
Best, no. Simplest, yes. 
---
Hardly any design behind it. Just a bunch of tents connected by dinky little bridges.
---
This build (called HOTW) is surprisingly the most popular druid build in vanilla/classic. The +20% stats is absurdly strong. It's the best "hyrbid" spec in the game. It's extremely strong in PVP, has enough feral talents to tank pretty much through MC, and very strong healing (heart of the wild comes close to being as strong as all the healing talents your missing). You can pretty much enjoy every aspect of the class without respecing. Only reason to really use another spec is if you want to go full feral tank or DPS. Putting 31 in Resto for raid healing isn't much better than the 20% int you lose from losing HOTW.
---
There are weapon skill trainers for different weapons me in the cities. 10s per skill.

12 different rank of 1 spell, is still 1 spell.

Go to Ironforge to train if you're Alliance. Probably Org on Horde. Ask a guard for the weapon trainer.

I enjoy his stream so that means I'm a worshiper, riiiight.

If you're referring to the debuff limit, correct. However, this post doesn't discuss the debuff limit.

Getting Ravager from SM Armory is life changing for a paladin. Provides an aoe proc that does insane damage

No, it's called nuance, and seems like a large portion of this sub can't grasp it.
---
There are many valuable/rare items out there that are treated differently from less valuable, less rare items.  If you see Staff of Jordan drop, you'd be an idiot not to need roll that no matter who you are.

Ohhh anyone on Blaumeux who needs a lesser magic wand, cloth bags and/or low level enchants please send me your info and I will mail it to you(or we can meet up somewhere for enchanting if you'd rather do it through trade.)
---
If you need a greater magic wand, higher level enchants, or wool bags I can make those too, but might take me a bit to get the mats. 
---
I can also send you heavy linen bandages and/or free food!
---
I don't think the amount of time you've spent playing the game as relevant at all in this discussion and therefore I don't believe that your argument has any value to this discussion
---
Rolling for money = GREED, end of story. I won't group with people who roll need for money.
---
Debuff limit, yes. This post is about the buff limit.
---
Hmm I tried that, and reinstalled it, didn't work for me.  Guess I'll just have to find an alternative, thanks mate.

Should help with the confusion.
---
He OBVIOUSLY meant Asmon's first since when it dropped they were talking about Esfand's raid getting one the day before. You are just being an asshole for no reason AND you are wrong lmao
---
My only argument to that is look at how building out the old game into something brand new worked for OSRS. It is doing amazing and bringing in more and more people each month while the only ones left playing the retail version keep it alive through ridiculous amounts of MTX.

Wow I really appreciate all of this feedback

His chat is cancer but that's most of Twitch and not exclusive to asmon.
---
I transferred to Heartseeker, and that was like day 2.
---
No it's definitely griefing when the vast majority of both factions are just leveling and running past each other and suddenly a group of 5 rush at you in particular and don't even go after the quest mob. And then you also go on to complain when that happens to you - like a Horde did last night. Kept killing Allies and got killed and then said "Alliance have no honor." He created that environment. 
---
Just because you can do it doesn't mean it's particularly useful or helpful at all. You're not PvPing or planning a strategy or lying in wait or anything clever. You're just in a group and steam rolling people fighting a mob slowly.
---
No but it gives you an idea of what its for.
---
Well if you refill your behind the wave makes life easier.
---
I don't know what they *will* do, but I've been thinking they should perhaps go multiple routes:
---
* One or two legacy servers which never move past these preplanned phases (for those hardcore oldschool only wanna play classic people.)
---
* A handful of progression servers which reset seasonally and go through the phases along with perhaps even TBC and Wrath (for all those who really really want to play up through Wrath.)
---
* Classic+ servers for the rest who are interested in expanding the game without raising the level cap or redoing the old expansions.
---
Which ever is most popular would end up with more servers of course, and that way if Classic+ goes off the rails somehow, we'd still have Legacy and Progression servers to play on.
---
I think it would really be the best of all worlds and come closest to making everyone happy.
---
As a druid I'm more worried about hitting the maximum number of macro's than the character limit.

But I concede that your way is superior.

And cloth.

In a hundred years, nobody is going to care if I choose to kill myself instead of have a cup of a coffee this afternoon.

And that is almost certainly true, but I keep choosing the coffee anyway.

How is your desire to upgrade your gear with an item that you will only be able to wear for 5 more levels any less greedy than me wanting to pick that item up to sell it in order to upgrade my character?
---
To type mid fight us huge thanks
---
Player buff limit should be 32 afair
---
As a tank, give me a few seconds to apply sunders to stack threat/demo shout the group before you unload. If one does peel off, that's what taunt is for.  Also, you can ask your tank if he has taunt macro'd for mouseover so he doesn't have to switch. 
---
    /cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] Taunt;
---
If he uses that instead of taunt (like out of spellbook) you can mouseover the mob and hit the button without changing targets, and as long as it's an enemy and not dead it will taunt it back in.
---
Honestly no idea, meme comes from some Gamegrumps youtuber "Egoraptor", can find it under "egoraptor do it again" on know your meme
---
I’m not sure if you know but battle shout gives you a lot of aggro so make sure you use it
---
a few decades? how much time do you think passed in retail?
---
Whoops! Fixed my post to have the right name. Thanks!
---
Druids are always good at pvp, that's a given. You're "underrepresented" because you're a tank class that uses leather and mana, a healer that doesn't have a good rez, or a dps that does less than a warlock. I mean have fun pvping. Maybe you'll get a heal slot on a raid as a BR'er... "versatile"1!! And great at nothing.
---
He is hardly a “MT”. Just cause he is a tank with another tank in the raid and he’s the streamer. Like wat.  The guy legitimately gets carried through every single aspect of the game, did nothing to help prepare the raid and people flock to him and carry through.
---
Dude can go fuck himself. If he wants people to help him he shouldn't be so fuckin selfish.

I like it, playing a healing lock would be cool!
---
[Decaying soul shards] expire after a certain time, but can be used to cast heals on your target by sacrificing them.  Good for settings with lots of adds, so you can replenish your decaying soul shards 
---
[Possesion] a demonic soul latches onto your target, siphoning the targets soul from each of their companions attacks and, grudgingly sharing some of the soul stolen as either health or additional damage. 
---
[Glory in pain] sacrifice a portion of your own life to heal the group. The lower the warlocks total life when used, the greater the group is healed for
---
You rolled for the wrong reason then.
---
So I just looked up Old Blanchy's stats and was kind of disappointed. It's a PvE server but the ratio is horrible. 35,000 alliance and the horde doesn't even have 5,000....
---
How is this going to affect WSG, AB, and AV when those come out? This is my first time playing alliance but Im kind of tempted to switch horde if it'll give me instant PvP queues.
---
My mistake ill amend that
---
Listen, you explaining shit to me doesnt change I'm fucking people up 7 levels higher then me.  I also messed up a shaman who was 5 levels higher. It happened. Now what constantly records like the  Nintendo switch because I dint have the biggest harddrive so I can show bad players like you how good players play. I've killed mutplie people higher then me because they are bad players. Kind of like how you are a bad player thinking I couldnt run you down if you were 5 levels higher then me. Also you dont factor in how duegon gear is better then your typical questing greens but your explanation was so much better. So if you got a HD program that recors like the Nintendo switch let me know so I can make a pvp video titled jaja horde is trash while rekting higher level people then me
---
Because they are not BiS items.
---
I have no idea what you're getting at - there are plenty of Horde on PvE servers as well? I'm Ally on Stalagg - and PvP is the primary reason I play. Yesterday I got ganked many times by Horde in STV/Desolace that were 10 levels or more above me. There are shitters on both sides. You act like there is some massive difference in the type of person that rolls horde or ally....theres not, we are all just WoW players.
---
Top the meters regularly because of chain heal. Very effective at keeping most of the raid group alive.
---
They are bad single target healers (particularly in terms of mana efficiency) but as long as you have a couple priests focused on the tank that not a problem at all
---
"I think"
---
Unless they are alliance then I wait for them to be on the last mob before I steal it. Then spit on them and run away. Lok’tar Ogar!
---
Source of the guy?
---
I’m a big daggers fan, it’s one of the reasons I like my Druid so much because of Shred and Claw both being viable.
---
What about combat daggers? Or a poison build w/ daggers? I understand combat sword is the easiest, but how would these compare? 
---
I know sub won’t work well, but asn with the poison talents should be solid right?
---
I’ve tried it, and I always end up chasing the one or two that get away. So idk.
---
people cared when they did it.
---
you're just a no lifer, everything is probably boring.
---
The problem with this is it just opens it up for ninjas to have an easy time. It's like asking to be ninjaed. Ninjas WANT everyone to greed these items. Items in vanilla are so much more valuable comparatively to retail. Some boes right now are best in slot for a very long time, until naxx in some cases. 
---
I think this rule varied from server to server. As I've said in another post: If you think everyone should pass on boes just wait till edgemasters drop (1850g right now on my server) and someone ninjas those puppies. You will change your mind quick.
---
I made the worst planned vacation ever months ago that I'm currently on and all I'm thinking about is wow. Was on the final stretch from 52-60 too.
---
ITT:  No one reads the post and says DEBUFF LIMIT IS 16
---
Split xp tho and then you’re stuck grinding for hours anyway because you didn’t grind enough for the items to begin with, and now the quest levels have outpaced you
---
That’s just what someone on a dead server would say...
---
Intelligently structured buildings and a well run oligarchy does not mean pomp, glamour, weak, or prissy in my world.
---
There doesn't need to be a choice. With the faction imbalances on some servers it wouldn't be fair to force people to play in an environment with long queues, or move to another server (which isn't even an option right now). That's less in the spirit of vanilla than cross-realm BGs could ever be.
---
Chests, sure.  Nodes, I dunno, just kinda take turns, who cares.  Never been given any beef for grabbing herbs without asking.
---
This all the way. If Dwarves were not on Alliance I'd abandon it in a heart beat. 
---
I will say though I generally prefer Alliance zones to Horde.
---
Yeah. I tested when I had a fire wand, and equipped a +fire damage item. The dmg on the wand tooltip went up equal to the amount. So my wand was even BEASTIER.
---
Tell him to back up
---
Its only scummy when you are the low level.
---
Theres nothing wrong with ganking lowbies, it becomes wrong when you camp lowbies (unless they camped you or something)
---
I think it used to be based on who rolled first, but now its just a hidden reroll
---
Pretty sure the frame addon is Shadowed unit frames.
---
You gotta wash off the salt.
---
He probs just didn't see you as ANY threat and that mindset played him. I had similar experience when I see a hordie rogue a few levels lower tgan me hacking alliance npcs to bits - I attacked him blatantly without an opener (im a rogue too) an I did not pop any cooldown, while he utilized every possible tool to his advantage. By the time I realised how much I underestimated this guy, it was too late for me to pop any tools of my own. I was a fool in this moment and I deserved my defeat.
---
Yeah but not everyone has the needed professions to profit from those bulk raw mats. Like I'm not a LW so I can't really do anything with all that leather I get from skinning besides selling it
---
Frost Mages! What talents are you using? I have seen a few builds and just wondering what the general consensus is for leveling.
---
Also, generic question: if you unlearn talents, do you have to buy spells again?
---
Oh look, another “Asmon receives surprise buttsex” thumbnail image.
---
"Intervene"
---
Pull moooooooaaaarrrrrrr ;)
---
Yea. I should have known better, it's Reddit after all.
---
Honestly I’m opposite! I made a mage this time around, but back in the day I rolled a drood, he was my favourite, the thing to remember is even if your done with tanking, you can switch roles! (I was healer and I miss that) dps, tank, healer you can technically do anything
---
Both, you timed your arrival just right (luck) and made the proper adjustment to make the jump and not smack your face on the engine (skill) congrats on not having to wait 10 more minutes
---
You are incorrect.  
---
1.9 standardized everything BUT pet swing speeds.
---
Broken is still at 1.0 for a while, there are some cougars and such at 1.2 all the way to 2.0.
---
Source: google.  Also am hunter with broken tooth / Lupos / humar and I can tell you BT hits very very fast compared the beasts I tamed to learn abilities.
---
Wait, Shamans don’t have totems anymore?
---
Ok, I'll defend this.  It's ALWAYS the melee DPS's responsibility to keep themselves in the right position to maximize DPS and minimize ad pulls.  DPS react to tanks, not the other way around.
---
It's the Tank's responsibility to get the position the pack off the pull in a safe area and face it away from healers/casters and then stay still.
---
Well it's based off of the scanning you do in the auction house. This is likely inflated by some jackass thinking he's funny skewing the prices of enchant mats. Also it estimates the number of drops which is also effecting the price estimate.
---
I remember wanting my first shoulders to drop so much, so felt right giving other people the chance to have them :)
---
nope.
---
Just a quick correction, Conquest was based on US-Kilrogg.
---
Buff and Debuff are two different things, people.
---
I also transfered to a new server (German Lucifron to Heartstriker) and am super unsure if I really want to stay here.
---
Ever since launch I've been questioning my server choices and it's really distracting me from just enjoying the game.
---
Blizzard really messed this up hard...
---
Will they actually implement paid transfers at some point?
---
Have you read the chat there? Decent people don't go to the barrens.
---
# You are incorrect with regarding normalization of pets in 1.9, that is simply just making sure pet movement speeds and pve dps are equalized across pet types. However the attack speeds are still different amongst them, this means Brokentooth still has a 1.0 attack speed.
---
I played rift at launch for quite a while until the first major pvp overhaul.   You could make basically every class a few buttons at launch.
---
My buddy and I even mapped out a set of macros and spec that would let you play a fully functional rogue on a NES controller.   Not a SNES controller...a NES controller (that means a D pad and four total buttons including start/select)   I wish I still had that doc with the macros, spec, and how we'd mapped it out.   It would all be nonsense nowadays b/c things have changed so much.
---
Was about to call blasphemy for saying anything is better than grid, but aptechka looks pretty awesome. Looks like grid with more customization? Is there anything specific it can do over grid that makes it a better choice?
---
people who are selfish in real life aren't magically going to become unselfish in game
---
Yeat that's just scummy, add the bastard to your list and make sure to never play with him ever again... damn that really really sucks...
---
Hey that's smart ! Will do that !
---
Same thing happened to me. Needed on corpsemaker as warrior tank. Got abused by the shaman and his rogue friend since apparently “shaman needs it more you shouldn’t need since you’re tank”. I lol’d in their faces and got out of there. I used the weapon all the way up until getting my WW axe - which was a good 6 levels later.
---
You'd think if there was any bug it'd be no limit. Surely no modern client has any sort of practical limit?
---
Look it up, you definitely did by directing your anger towards me.
---
How could you trade items in a dungeon? Afaik this only works in raids.
---
This is my favorite thing about Druids. You can wake up and *decide which class you want to be today!* 
---
Some days I want to be a tank. Some days I want to do all my Quests as if they were MGS stealth missions. I can do both!
---
Distract! Have fun
---
Or people could just not ninja stuff.
---
It can crash right into r/classicwowplus
---
Yo dawg l2read.
---
Yep, mouseover for rogues are very important because of the combo-point loss from switching targets (I think even if you target a Ally in combat the combo points are lost, but I could be wrong about that).
---
I feel ya on this one. I got ganked by an alliance rogue 4 lvls higher than me while fighting two mobs so I came back and stalked him (I’m a Druid) waiting for a good moment to return the favor. After a minute or two I see a Horde Warrior come by and he is oblivious to the fact this rogue sees him and stealths. So I position myself for the counter gank. Sure enough a few seconds later the rogue attacks the warrior. I pouch to the rescue and attempt to save him. Get the rogue to about 100 health and then he hits me for a stun and a massive crit to kill me and I don’t even care cause I know that warrior can kill him! Low and behold the warrior does nothing and laughs on my corpse as the rogue slinks away thinking he was fleeing.... in a fit of rage I message the warrior WTF?! And he says he didn’t help cause the rogue would of killed him. The rogue who was one shot, who attacked him first, would of killed him... Some people truly have no honor, I attempted to save his life and he responded by refusing to defend himself and laughing on my body.
---
Thanks for the perspective. The MCP grind actually doesn't intimidate me heavily due to it's proximity to IF (I'm alliance) and I hear it's not much time with the backdoor. And I understand I will need to farm things I need. I'm hoping I will still be able to progress, albeit slower, in a casual guild. I don't know if I'm even concerned with reaching naxx (was grinding that place regularly in WotLK on release), though I do hope to see everything else prior.
---
I think I'm just swimming in a cloud of uncertainty right now. I guess really I can always make an alt if I'm unhappy. Leveling has never been my enemy luckily.
---
No reason to unless you want to learn something new. If you unlearn a profession you'll have to start from level 1 again with it
---
oh, i downlaoded ElvUI from here  [https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui](https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui) , and then i downloaded the application of TukUI and downloaded the rest.  [https://www.wowhead.com/guides/elvui-addon-setup-customization](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/elvui-addon-setup-customization) i chose BenikUI, you can choose your own and just configure it accordingly. don't really need to download everything. :D
---
No, not really.
---
In this case, the party discussed it, and we knew that it was free game for anyone in the party.  But we all decided to pass for the hunter, just because we were in a super lowbie dungeon, and we felt like being generous.
---
We had all earned that gun, and that gun just represented gold (because the hunter could have gone to the AH to buy one at any time).
---
So we basically just handed the hunter gold because we felt like it.  It was charity, and I don't regret my decision at all.   But that was a personal choice, not what was fair to everyone else.   The fair option would have involved everybody rolling.
---
Are you fucking kidding me?  I mained rogue in rift from launch until the first pvp overhaul patch.   There were a *ton* of good specs that used insane amounts of macros.  Those same specs were a nightmare to play without said macros.
---
It's time that gnomes get the recognition they deserve. They are 1/2 a normal person.
---
Rogues have stunlock, poisons, and only one set of gear.
---
Warriors can wear everything from plate to leather.
---
A different planet
---
First of all NE starts with 25 base agi, Dwarf starts with 16. Account for Blessing of Kings that's 28 (rounded up) vs. 17 base agi. 14 Ranged AP = 1 DPS, so the baseline difference between a NE and a Dwarf before critical strike/procs is 1 DPS.
---
Gun skill sounds awesome because we all know how important weapon skill is for melee, but it ends up not mattering much for two reasons. One is the result of mechanics, the other has to do with itemization.
---
Ranged attacks can't be glanced/blocked/parried so gun skill only governs chance to hit. 5 additional skill lowers the hit cap vs. +3 levels (boss) but Dwarves end up having to overcap on hit because there's no better options.
---
Finally, there just aren't that many gun upgrades in the game. You're stuck with bows and crossbows 99% of the time so you can't even utilize that gun skill. That's why NE is optimal.
---
You can only have 2 professions at any one time, If you choose to unlearn one to make room for a different one you will lose all progress you’ve made on that profession. You can level your secondary professions at any time though, First aid, cooking, and fishing.
---
I really want to play a feral druid this go around.  I was a holy priest back when.
---
So, theres a decent chance I will be selected as one of the tanks for progression in my guild. Once everyone is geared enough can i tank as pvp spec (arms) or will i have to stay prot forever? Does this change depending on if you are MT or OT (if i had to guess i would probably be one of the OTs, but i dont know yet) I dont think il be making enough gold to spend 50g a week respeccing.
---
I wanna slay some bgs.
---
&gt; fuck over someone else 
---
Yeah, who didn't have the forethought to do the same 
---
&gt; extreme amounts of phone data 
---
Unlimited, son
---
Somewhere else. I think one of the best things about vanilla is that there are the two faction specific classes.
---
Thanks guys, this is all immensely helpful
---
Do you know of any other repeatable darnassus quests besides the obvious Runecloth? Morrowgrain is another but that's annoying.
---
🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
In all seriousness though, Blizzard doesnt need to add a report button on the popup. Theres already a report option for abuse/scamming like this.
---
&gt; an item
---
JUST an item guys, who cares
---
That "fluff" was the edge I used to survive solo in orgrimmar, defeat groups of horde, and be able to consistently win 1v1s against mages as a warrior. Stance dancing almost every GCD, pulling tricks like shield blocking a blind, quick disarm swaps, etc. without it, this becomes a very shallow game.
---
This is a role-playing game.
---
Not a dishwasher.
---
Neither of us skin
---
Did you take a picture of your computer screen
---
Amazing thanks!
---
&gt;If blizzard would just give us a sensible moderated world chat then we could use both but noooo
---
Sometimes I wonder how humanity lasted this long without unmoderated chat! Dear God it must have been horrible!
---
I can watch this over and over again. His little arms and legs going like the clappers 😂
---
Yea this was hard to watch
---
Considering its patch 1.12 talents gear etc, any guild can take more than one spriest and be just fine.
---
I believe the word you're looking for is mercenary, not nuance. People act differently when money is involved. At least be honest about it though.
---
Many people who wouldn't normally gank, will gank you just for being a gnome.
---
You're not wrong :P
---
Jumping in as a guy who’s tanked MC as a bear. Yes, you are going to need crowd pummelers, they are our burst threat generation of last resort if it looks like threat is an issue on a boss. You’ll go through fewer the better you get, but it doesn’t take hours to farm them. I’d say bring 5 per raid, which you can get in an hour or so using the Gnomer backdoor. 
---
More important are your gear, commitment, and patience for getting raid-ready. You may have to heal for MC groups on farm night to get your purples, it’s what I did. Bear tank is slow to become raid-ready, but immensely rewarding. 
---
Let this be your bible. Shoot for as many of the pre-raid bis things as you can while leveling (crafting pieces, enchanting skill, etc):
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
no, it's a problem for pretty much every mmo, nobody's brave enough to stray away from the standards
---
Yeah, I just didn't get how it applied though, hence my statements. Now that I understand you're talking about pvp,  neatplates is likely what you want.
---
It's perfect for scenarios where you dont have a "party frame" type ui element but still need to track health, buffs and debuffs.
---
Dude that's what happened/happens.
---
he never played bc and also never alliance
---
It is too easy because server population. You know that boss you spent 20 minutes killing mobs to get to?  Well that path is already cleared and now you are just standing there begging for an invite to hope your group tags the respawn.  I have found peace in the fact that difficulty will come through organizing raids and PvP at 60 and not from actually getting to 60.
---
Hmm no? Where did I say that?
---
PvE: 1st Player: Warrior; 2nd Player: Holy Paladin &gt; Priest &gt; Shaman &gt; Druid; 3rd Player: Mage &gt; Warlock.
---
Warrior can tank even if not Protection. Paladins must spec Holy to heal decently.  Priest can heal as Shadow or Holy.   
---
 Shamans heal in PvE better than Druids and have terrific totems.  Druids are only good at 1v1 and capture the flag or with a Rogue.  Mages do best in dungeons for AoE reasons and food/water and at later levels able to open portals.  Warlocks are decent at AoE but mainly there for summoning to a dungeon (cannot summon inside an instance), health stones, soul stones, and synergizes with a Shadow Priest (Shadow Weaving talent).  Rogue is top DPS which is pretty much the only thing they bring to PvE.  Hunter is worst DPS which is why they're dead last but do well at CC.
---
PvP: 1st Player: Warrior; 2nd Player: Holy Paladin &gt; Priest &gt; Druid = Shaman; 3rd Player: Warlock &gt; Hunter &gt; Mage &gt; Rogue.
---
Warrior has Mortal Strike are beasts at PvP.  Holy Paladin is considered #1 healer for PvP.  Priest is an offensive healer able to weaken enemies with Dispel.  Druids are able to heal-on-the-move and can remove Curses and Poisons which are nightmares for healers (Curse of Tongues, Mind-Numbing Poison, Wound Poison).  Shamans synergize with melee due to Wind Fury and can Purge away buffs better than Priests.  Warlocks are best in PvP groups because of Fear, multi-DoT, Felhutner dispel, Succubus sleep, and loads of other things.  Hunter is better than group PvP than Rogue as they can do Viper Sting to drain mana (synergizes very well with Warlock Drain Mana and Priest Mana Burn) and they are able to kite and trap.  Mages can kite and sheep.  Rogues are best at 1v1 or with a Druid in a stealth group.
---
open world is a lot different than end game pve
---
So heal rank 1 doesn't suffer from the downranking penalty?
---
Thank you! I've been trying to remember this.
---
No that was fifteen years ago and the family has fallen apart since due to the above dynamic so I'm pretty sure it was a portent lol
---
Props for trekking all the way across the world to Durotar as a dwarf just to get a damn tiger. Super committed.
---
Immolate is the best spell to open with, I usually immolate, corruption, drain life and then drain soul. 
---
Drain life is a mana neutral skill because it drains as much life as it costs mana, so it's technically free if you consider life tap. Drain soul will regen mana if you are talented into it. This wont draw too much threat but will still pull off your VW after a couple ticks of drain life. I have been using the succubus instead and she does almost half of the damage I deal to mobs. 
---
If this sounds like something you want to try I recommend Dive's Drain Tanking Guide. Its here on reddit, easily found on google.

MOUNT BATTTLE! Ö

Awesome, good to know I'm already doing what I can then. Thanks!

Definitely level with a 2hander. 100% arms or fury, fury is more two 1 handers though. You do not need to level as protection. Nor is it recommended.
---
Jews can’t be Paladins
---
All these comments and no one links the item. Do you know what it's called? Double furor would be awesome.
---
thank you, mr. blizzard engineer.
---
I was doing that quest in Westfall where you need to collect a pocket watch from a wardrobe which is guarded by a level 12 defias mob and a level 15 named mob, and I had gotten the level 12 down, but the fight against the named mob was not going well; had blown all cool downs, bandages and pots on CD, etc. I realized I was gonna die. Then a hunter pops in and I think I'm saved. He stands there with his cat by side, watching me for a moment and then turns and loots the pocketwatch. He then turns *back* to me, where I am very obviously about to die, stands there and watches me for another moment before bouncing, without even a simple serpent's sting to help me out. 
---
I usually give people the benefit of the doubt, assuming they're probably just a noob or else not used to the more cooperative nature of Clasisic vs retail, but holy shit just the fact that he stood there watching me die and could even send his pet in to help me or something. I don't get mad at much in this game, but that really peeved me.
---
You are 100% correct, a warlock jumping a warrior 1v1, especially one that comes prepared with VW sac should never lose to a warrior.
---
As you say, most people aren't great so little tips to beat them can help :)
---
This is it
---
Sure, but we don't know what populations blizz is actually going for post layering (prob higher than 3.5k concurrent) and we don't know what the drop off is going to be from people playing less/quitting altogether. We likely won't need to have that many server xfers at all.
---
All of those realms are now just as dead but  hyphenated realms.  Point it isn’t worth transferring to a new server.
---
The worst kind I think are the ones saying "welcome to classic" or "get used to it" like its a normal and integral part of the game to be a little dickling to others. they never seem to realise they're part of the problem.
---
In this level range, you should be able to just 2hand tank the entire way.   
---
Start your pulls like this  
---
Charge -&gt; sweeping strikes -&gt; berserker stance -&gt; bloodrage -&gt; whirlwhind -&gt; battle stance -&gt; demo shout  
---
With WW Axe, you should be able to outpace your groups threat just on damage alone.
---
That, and only a moron would wish its demise. Especially since they can just stop playing it if they don't like it.
---
There are no dead realms
---
If you think about it like the warlock is only healing people to further his/her own gains then I think it does. Plus sacrificing demons and gaining their power feels pretty in line with warlock fantasy to me.
---
I suggest pallies every time. Once I got to 60 I could basically farm any lower level dungeon with AoE pulls.
---
why do you think i pointed it out
---
People who really wanna know when Kresh has Shell Shield
---
correct, it was not there on day one of BG's but some realms were encountering 2hr queues to enter one due to realm imbalance. which is why cross-realm was added.
---
I am stuck at level 10 on multiple characters due to my indecisiveness. I firstly can’t decide between playing on a PvE server on the weaker side of a huge faction imbalance or an RPvP server with a more even faction balance. 
---
Then I’m switching between rogue, Druid and shaman. Or warlock just for nostalgia. 
---
I want to end up with 2 characters to play. One of them needs to be stealth because I want to be able to have fun stealthiness around opposite faction cities. 
---
I don’t care that much about easy levelling. 
---
I like a the class fantasy of all three that I am considering. 
---
I have never got on with melee dps before but am not hating it so far although I do prefer ranged. 
---
I am happy to end up healing as long as I can still do a bit of PvP/ rep farming in the same spec. 
---
I’d like to be able to get into pug groups easily as I don’t have a lot of playtime so can’t commit to a regular raid time. 
---
Ive never done much PvP before but am interested in learning to get better at it. 
---
But I can’t decide. 
---
Maybe rogue on PvE server because there are less of them and I’ll have somewhere to go if the ganking gets to me?
---
Druid or shaman on the PvP server?
---
End game pve is different from open world and pvp, also you dont *HAVE* to go combat swords.
---
What
---
I think floating combat text in the interface options will show this when you enable it.
---
God I can only imagine what Elwynn Forest would look like right now without layering...
---
And the hunter does twice the damage and never gets resisted and has a built in off-tank.   There is more to consider than buffs and water.
---
Lol yep I had a Druid throw a temper tantrum because I needed on the hypnotic blade and won. He claimed that he deserved it more because he didn’t have a weapon yet and I had the crescent staff already. I told him I won the roll fair and square and this ain’t a loot council. It’s a pick up group. He ended up rage quitting the group.
---
You said:
---
1. The group is formed differently.
---
2. You have to run to the dungeon.
---
3. Everything else is the same.
---
The only thing left is the actual dungeon itself. Yes, running a dungeon is still running a dungeon. The things people didn’t like about RDF are the first two points.
---
Also, as you acknowledge, you didn’t even play in vanilla. How would you know what it was like to try and critique it?
---
What’s your rep at btw, if you don’t mind
---
Classic wow is sooo super relaxing. I don't feel rushed at all to do anything or to max, min/maxing oe being as efficient as possible, topping charts, or some other shit. Feels like second life or the sims tbh. Like a virtual life simulator rather than an mmorpg.
---
Not only did this remind me of the cartoon, but it reminded me of  Hobbs old power leveling video lol
---
There’s already /world for that.
---
No. I started doing the runs yesterday, it’s actually much easier. The agre range is better for sneaking through the packs so you can literally run the whole way. And then Princess runs slightly faster, but you just send your VW in on her when she gets close and she farts on him and then you call the VW back to you. GG
---
Ignore this poster, He erased all his comments to be a shitposting troll for this subreddit.
---
Essentially no need for AH, Amazing.
---
Guys it works. My dumbass didn’t have the latest update. Seeeeeee you guys on the other side !!!!! Thanks for the help
---
Gotcha.  So I can basically roll an arms warrior and still tank those 1 - 59 dungeons just fine, is what you're saying?  That is good to know.  And should I just assign my talent points to arms / fury for now and then respec end game?  Or are there any must have prot talents I should get now for dungeons while I level?
---
 *His fucking face is melting.* . . . oh man this is some top quality content, great read. That warrior should have known better.
---
They are. But they are divided between the 3 specs meaning ultimately 1/3 of your unique spells are locked behind each spec.
---
I can't have gouge as an assination or subtlety rogue only as combast. In classic I have gouge, but it's effectiveness can only be improved in the combat tree. It does not deter me however from using the skill wether I want to or not. The choice is mine. And that's the most important thing in a game. To at least be given the choice on what you want to do.
---
How the fuck do Rogues compete for tank gear? Are Warriors running around in leather to tank MC now?
---
While Rogues are not the DPS monsters that Fury Warriors are, they are strong. Unlike Warriors, they have a threat dump, Vanish.
---
Rogues don't buff. They **debuff** the target. Mind-Numbing, Crippling, and Wounding poison all do debuffs, not just damage. 
---
Rogues don't summon. Then again, most other classes don't either. That is unique to Warlocks and Mages.
---
Rogues do heal the party proactively. That Kick that interrupted that cast is damage that never happened. That's better than a heal, but won't get noted by the all-important meter.
---
Highly geared Vanilla Rogues were able to mitigate damage better than Warriors because they are able get 101.8% avoidance, making them immune to physical attacks. Enrage mechanics can go fuck off when the boss literally can't touch the tank.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=6770/sap This looks like CC to me.
---
Who has higher priority?
---
I don’t use DS/Ruin. I’m SM/Ruin. But yeah, I wouldn’t Immo if DS
---
Your crazy pickiness really only leaves you with Druid or Rogue.  I'd go Druid since you will be solo.
---
If you haven't figured it out by now I don't know what to tell you.
---
If you are a good enough Hunter you will get raid spots.
---
Bad hunters get replaced with good ones
---
Don't be bad
---
Staring at the desktop screen isn’t obvious either
---
Just want to say - I'm not rich in this game by any means, but you can make a *lot* of Gold as you're leveling by ditching the Greens and Blues you pick up from dungeons into the AH! 
---
Even if you only sell them for silver, it's often 100%-200% profits vs. the vendor. Any time I get a (obviously generic) green from a dungeon I throw it onto the AH, and they usually sell like hotcakes. As long as the price isn't crazy, folks buy them for leveling/DE.
---
What level are you, and is there anything specific that you have trouble with?
---
Finally settled on warlock after sampling some other classes. I have friends both horde and ally so I currently have a lock on both factions. I plan to do both pve and pvp but can’t decide which faction I want to focus on more. And tips to sway my decision one way or another?
---
I can't believe we are getting the 30min race to kill the boss AV instead of the 8+ hour AV that was an iconic part of wow.
---
Yes. As an arms warrior, at level 17, you should basically just be using rend, sunder, and overpower. Skip heroic strike entirely. There was a great thread yesterday about why heroic strike is terrible and worthless unless you have max rage. 
---
I just hit 18 on my warrior, and my battle sequence is basically charge, rend, bloodlust, sunder, sunder, sunder, with overpower if they dodge. That's it.
---
Vendor, vendor, vendor...
---
Get auctionator addon and do daily scans of the AH and if something is 2x more expensive than its vendor price list it on the AH.
---
Also, loot everything.
---
Diminishing returns are already in the game for classes - including rogues. 
---
Class quests etc will get added in later phases.
---
Keep auto shot on your bar to easily turn it on or off. User the WeaponSwingTimer addon to keep track of your shot timing, your auto shots take half a second to go off and your abilities will interrupt that. You need to weave your shots between your auto shots.
---
Also, just make sure to keep a stack of food with you that your pet will eat. I typically just bring generic vendor food. Keep your pet's happiness up, it does more damage when it's happy.
---
As far as how to approach fights, I typically send in my pet (I have pet attack bound to my scroll wheel click) and start shooting when it's about halfway there. If your pet isn't holding threat very well then you'll want to wait a little longer. I recommend getting a carrion bird that knows screech and dash, it'll help a ton in that regard. If you're Alliance (or Horde and willing to make a long trip) then you can get one in Westfall with rank 1 screech already, otherwise you have to wait until the early 30s to get one with rank 2 from Thousand Needles.
---
That's all fine and good,  but why should he bother grouping with rogues and risking a bad experience when he could just not group with them and guarantee he won't have a bad experience with a rogue?
---
Mara Princess runs are all I’ve done because it’s so lucrative. 30-40g if the ring drops.
---
I'm glad I buckled in for that 3 sentence rant
---
Yes. Its way better than the heroic strike option.
---
Yeah idk what this mans is talking about, even if hes swing timing all hes gotta do is slice and dice
---
A hunter that uses his axe is a bad hunter lol
---
You still have to get across the plank though ;)
---
If i remember correctly, the chance of getting one back in the day was 1:170,000. And it was/is a world drop, which means it cannot be traced or farmed in any way. It drops out of the blue from dozens of different mobs all across the world. Being an epic that is below 60, it makes for perhaps one of the most valuable singular items in the game.
---
Tread carefully, you may never even SEE another of these staffs. &lt;:)
---
I disagree, better to toss him into the fire right away, besides warrior is much more interesting with stance dancing and what not than a warlock/hunter which are more newbie friendly
---
About all I can say is maybe theres another way around that because I have never seen that pop up and have attacked the guards before. I'm not saying your for sure wrong but there has to be a way around it because I've never seen such an option and have clicked the guards and gotten attacked before.
---
I’m just waiting for someone to make Aux compatible. All the other auction addons are absolute trash in comparison
---
yupp, but i decided to do on my own, didn't use any profiles. still figuring out the key bindings and all. but i wanna get to 60 first. haha
---
Water is everything.
---
Just saying, bought a wardens staff off the AH after trying to farm for one for 2 days straight, 1 hour later warden staff drops. RNG is a bitch.
---
Seen all of these except the 3d printed yet.
---
You can probably off tank in PvP spec but really if you are getting geared and one of the primary tanks in your guild you should be respeccing for raid nights. If you ask your guild they will probably tell you their preference and if they want you to respec they might chip in for at least one respec.
---
This isn't Vanilla. This is Classic.
---
Arguing against a more balanced PvP experience just makes you look whiney over nothing. We're not "re-writing" history here, we're making new history in a recreation of an old game. 
---
Cross-realm battlegrounds were implemented in part because it was realized just how much of a necessity they were for people that ended up on shitty servers. Just because something was in the game for longer doesn't make it better, the 3 month vs 14 month debate you keep throwing in the comments isn't really a reason to do it the wrong way. By that logic, Classic just wouldn't be based on 1.12 at all and we'd get rid of everything that wasn't in the game for "most" of the time before TBC.
---
Int/spell damage/frost damage for your frost mage.
---
Int/healing power/spirit for your priest.
---
Someone drops their mobs on you like that, vanish on their ass.
---
Nice try! You just want all of trade chat to yourself!!!
---
Mods are busy playing classic, is my guess ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I use it all the time, never failed me.
---
Do you honestly believe 37 classic Rogue is harder than endgame Retail fury War?
---
Yes continue using rend until you get whirlwind. Once u get whirlwind and MS u never use rend. U have to talent into imp rend to get the other bleeding talent which is really good.
---
I have not got it. It’s a low drop rate sadly. I’m using Spirit of Aqua from that long add Ungoro quest line.
---
haha, sorry, was a little too excited!
---
Them double warrior tank UBRS feels, yikes. Y’all should split up and find some ferals to OT.
---
Tremor, earthbind, and grounding don't feel better they just strait up nerfed them so people won't feel the need to have to bring a shaman because bring the player not the class and because blizzard hates totems so they just gutted them so they don't need to balance them.
---
How much of a difference in damage realistically is there for holy vs ret paladin? Particularly for leveling solo? 
---
I started out leveling with groups of friends but most of them have stopped playing regularly so I don't really need to be The healer role in the group. Is it worth while to respec as retribution to level solo? Is there a more hybrid spec where you a bit of holy, bit of retribution? ( So what talents should I be prioritising if I did that) Or should I just stick it out with Holy (I don't really die at all I just don't do much damage and it takes forever to kill mobs)
---
Blizzard is going to lower the realm caps when they get rid of layering because the world would be completely unplayable with 18k users in one realm; as I stated in the post, the original caps were around 3k and based on Blizzard's pursuit of authenticity we can probably expect them to pursue something similar, but even if they went double that at 6k which is quite crowded we're still headed for issues.
---
U G U 101 101 U G U
---
will show up as
---
L O L zug zug L O L
---
to the alliance
---
In my experience if I roll same number as someone else I won’t get the loot lol
---
Pretty weak attempt to provoke some kind of reaction. Keep going with the personal insults though, apparently that's all you've got to defend your ninjaing.
---
Because inside a dungeon you can't have pvp. So if you're spamming dungeons, that's all the pvp you're gonna get.
---
Why only 10 seconds? Because everybody's too busy rushing to 60, they only go out of the dungeon to reset and go in again.
---
Nice eye cancer image
---
I mean, I guess seeing as we have the undead?
---
Literally got yoinked of the first axe by a hunter myself.
---
Okay then dont play it.
---
you warror you smash zug zug
---
If you do this, I hate you, but I also like you and I'll probably end up playing with you.
---
They are relaunching an archage unchained with no p2w next month I believe
---
Having troubles with leveling, 28 undead frost mage and prefer questing over AOE farming (am playing with others as well) and have been doing like, 2-3 quests in a zone and running back to another one as I catch up to the red/orange quests sitting in my log between Hillsbrad/Stonetalon/Thousand Needles. Is there somewhere else I should be questing? Should I just spam SM GY and other wings when I am able to? TIA
---
Asheron's call anyone?
---
Last night I rolled a mage and one same-level mob resisted my only spell three times in a row.
---
_FEEL THE POWER_
---
I remember I took a break from wow, then came back and wondered where the heck all the spells went.  I guess it kind of makes sense you can't keep increasing the number of spells, but it was weird to see them go backwards.
---
As a mage, should I be levelling fireball JUST for water elementals or am I fine just avoiding them and saving the gold
---
you just need a friend :D
---
I wish I could turn up the ground clutter to 7, but I'm an herbalist and it makes it really hard to find the herbs, so I leave it at 1.
---
What about RP-PVP tho
---
If you think the alliance is any better you have another thing coming.
---
Shoulda played alliance.
---
Looting while the rest of the party is killing stuff- the true classic experience.
---
Take up fishing and you'll never have to worry about pet food again.
---
Went war cuz I always liked them but never played one in vanilla.  Had a decent time getting to 20.  Tanked RFC and WC, but just got too frustrated with solo play. Rerolled a lock and I'm having fun.  Now I cant to get home to play him!
---
&gt;but doesn't this lead to a server looking more empty than it is?
---
Tried questing in Elwynn Forest yet?  Tried doing the Defias or Gnoll quests there?  They highlight exactly why layerying was needed, as they are extremely difficult to finish with layering during high-peak hours.
---
So yes, it does lead to a more-empty world for the interim, but thats a good thing for starter areas.  Eventually they will be removed.
---
For the record, the layering only kicks in when things get congested, so it won't "over layer" already small populations, or shouldnt at least.
---
I didn't say it wasn't a dick move, just that lock picking isn't remotely the same thing as making a soulstone or some water/food.
---
Only time I'm bothering to stealth mobs is if a) they're humanoids so I can pickpocket boxes and b) the area isn't swarming with other players who are going to keep sniping them from me.
---
Otherwise just throw knives and get your tag asap.
---
Blizzard making posts on here to get people to xfer or something?
---
Handy tip I learned thst skills font tell druids. Maul and Swipe generate bonus threat. Warrior and pally skills with bonus threat tell them, druids dont oddly.
---
I disagree, that's a more likely scenario. Blizz isn't trying to recapture classic audience in retail, there were about as many subs now as there was during classic. If anything, they're trying to recapture Wrath, when subs were 3x what they were.
---
Layers are essentially replicas of the world. For example, say your server has 3 layers and you are playing in layer one and your friend, playing in layer 2 invites you. You move to layer 2 so that you can quest and play together.  Layering is only used to make the quests doable. Imagine no layers where 10000 people doing the same quests during release. You would never tag a mob or be able to kill a named boss. Layers make it so you only compete with a fraction of that population. 
---
Once the server loses some population and the world would look empty, Blizz steps in and reduces or removes the layers.  This way, the game always feels equally populated.
---
An mmorpg?
---
Yes, I know. As I pointed out in the beggining of the post, I just wanted to  make SOME people aware of their hypocrisy. I guess nothing bad on giving an opinion. After all, it can affect us all.
---
Thunderfurry is a better server. Change my mind.
---
It's almost like every server has its own economy.
---
WPL is faster, but you need to take off your armor to avoid durability loss, and you'll likely die.  Running northwest across the last and up from undercity is safer but slower.
---
? I don't understand the question.
---
When two players tie there is another internal roll for a tie breaker that isn't shown. Is that what you're asking?
---
hmm? I have 4 different classes. This is actually more of a variety than most dungeon cleave groups.
---
Get auctioneer.
---
Well shit. There goes my "rotation".
---
I named my cat tony the tiger, i'll horde that cereal is GREAT!
---
No, stupid.
---
Bags are 2g at material cost. The Rune Thread alone is 50 silver. In some markets that's even selling at a loss. There's literally no point other than everyone undercutting mindlessly.
---
But there's no official war before in the lore. It is an uneasy peace but peace nonetheless. All Classic BGs are border incidents between lesser factions not directly controlled by Horde or Alliance. As a NE it makes no sense for me to attack tauren or Darkspear trolls as they did nothing wrong to me. Same with most orc clans except Warsong who are trying to overtake Ashenvale. Undead of course are horrible abominations and should be destroyed on sight.
---
AN HOUR AN A HALF LEFT BEFORE I GET TO GO HOME AND PLAY WOW. I’m screaming.
---
You can’t BOP someone who isn’t in your party
---
I did that quest the other day as a lowbie Warrior, had no idea he'd have a friend... I died. People saw and I got rezzed by a Priest. Said thanks, dropped quest and went back in the inn. They followed me, and I took the quest again, ran after the dood, and like 5 people helped me kill it. Felt great and was sooo thankful! This warrior always tries to help out when I see someone struggling to kill a mob. Charge, taunt or mocking blow, thunder blast. I do what I can to pay it forward.
---
Well, one guy got really unlucky and lost a roll even though all he had to do to win was not roll a 1  
---
The other guy got really lucky and won a roll even though he only had a chance to win with a 100.   
---
Not much more to it.
---
Does classic lose some of its great aspects over time? Yes.
---
Does it turn into retail? Hell no. The game IS designed well, and its design is critical for how the classic community works.
---
Probably a tooptip bug. 
---
Would be funny if you did explain the leveling process- then proceeded to sell it as a guide.  #comitment
---
You mean shamans but with sword specialization?
---
Hats off for sticking to it though. If you would’ve rolled alliance you wouldn’t have that issue 😉
---
Here's a thought: Don't roll on PVP servers. Open world PVP just means ganking from much higher level griefers (was about to say trolls, but most trolls i've met in game were very nice). Or rogues backstabbing you while you're fighting multiple mobs. Or giant zerg rushes people can't possible stand up against, or ...
---
You get the idea. You signed on the dotted line and now you regret your life choices.
---
There’s a whole open world between you and the dungeon that pvp can happen in. You have to actually get the flight paths and leave the city and explore.
---
If you just say “yeah but that doesn’t count” to all the things that are different between the two of course they are going to sound identical.
---
Maybe?
---
No, this is a standard HotW spec to be used for tanking, healing, and PvP.  It is a great all around spec for druids and absolutely fine for tanking dungeons, offtanking raids, and healing both.
---
Did you even watch the video? He has 2 mages, a warlock, warrior and priest.. not 5 same classes.
---
iI've never had this, is this only in NA?
---
Good shit, this reminded me of Never Stay Tuned.
---
Try auctionater it’s a little easier than auctioneer.
---
Item was best in slot for him until raids drops so he needed it. Someone else in his party also needed it. They rolled thr ssme number. The game handles this as a 50/50 coin toss (I believe) and he lost it. No item for him.
---
Who remembers the good old underground mining bots teleporting all around lol?
---
Well no shit. That's why I said mages in big aoe pulls will do the most damage. The vast majority of dungeon groups are not 3mage aoe groups.
---
Note that you can't put them on your bar.  I really like the addon, but not being able to have a visual reference kills me.  I think its more of a limitation of WoW than than the addon itself.
---
Check out Homeworld Remastered. They not only remade the first game in the engine of the second game (with various degrees of success, but that's besides the point), they *also* included the original games in their unaltered state (just some tweaks to get them working on a modern OS). That's basically the gold standard in terms of remasters or remakes.
---
[I mean yeah, I get it.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/613136291718103102/621178647524671488/WoWScrnShot_091019_193549.jpg)
---
It's about finding a mage who is in the area who is willing to stop what he's doing and make water and hopefully a decent price and doing this every time you log in. Not every healer will be able to find one before getting in a group, what if the mage only made 20 and he ran out... So many scenerios can happen. No where did I say a healer should have a stash of water. I.E I had 40 moonberry juice, more than enough to run an instance if given the chance to drink. (was in uldaman) these are 18s for 5 so over a gold in water. No mage in the group, no mages near me the only mage I saw gave me mana I needed to drink 3 just to become 100% gave me 1 stack of 20 over the course of me questing buffing people etc. 
---
  Needless to say the tank who wiped us twice from huge over pulls, and starting large pulls when I'm at 50% mana causing deaths, people pulling aggro etc makes 40 water go by fast as hell. Between 3 pulls I could use 3 out of my 40. This doesn't count the drinking after buffing so we can start moving along. One of the dps handed me all his mana drinks cuz he didn't use them. 
---
  Emergency pots of course we have them doesn't mean I'm going to be drinking them because the tank wants to pull before I'm ready.  Even when asking him to stop so I can drink didn't fix the issue. Good healer or not any water you hand me will make me love you even if i have 100 stacks of the finest water.
---
I don't play Rogue. I don't have the rhythm for energy management.
---
Devilsaur stuff is crafted, not dropped. 
---
Truestrike is the only shoulder with hit, but guess what, you can run it again, and faster with a DPS that murders shit more. https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12590/felstriker is probably better than Dal'rends since it procs crit spam, while Dals needs the set to be good.
---
Laugh at stunlocks all you want, until the half-asleep Warlock slaps Corruption on something and pulls it. Stunlocks aren't for planned CC, but OH SHIT!! CC.
---
No....
---
Why would ZF not be released until Phase 5....
---
A lot of people don't like draenei I take it
---
This is only because no one has gear. Once warriors and rogues get geared mages dont stand a chance. And second what the Pally said above me, us pallys are unstoppable.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295044/classic-hotfix-demoralizing-shout-roar-generated-too-much-threat
---
Op here, what’s your typical 2h tanking rotation? Start in bstance, charge, tclap, dstance, rends, sunders, Demo shout, etc? How much of your time is spent in battle or berserker stance?
---
Oh man I've been doing the same, esp. in STV, all those victims of Alliance aggression need salvation.
---
Agreed, but it's so much better then retail.
---
Thanks I'm cured
---
Gotta fuel the fires of the Goblin Foundry with something!
---
Hey man, how dare you steal the BDE tabard. Meet me in sw right now we must duel for the right of ownership.
---
I'm level 30 and I have over 20 things sitting at the trainer, and sitting pretty for gold.
---
Don't train it if its not in your basic rotation.
---
Don't forget being really, really, really, ridiculously good looking.
---
That's some dope looking wand you got there

---
Is Deadly Boss Mods supposed to be doing anything in 5 mans?  I'm only up to BFD but I've never seen it say anything, I'm assuming because they're tank and spanks with no mechanics?
---
That's actually pretty interesting.
---
Oh totally agree, I love classic.
---
you're welcome :D
---
Hell yes, had the same experience lol
---
I'm super happy that the original creator had made this so people can experience what Blizz was attempting with their new camera system.
---
Happy to help make it available on Classic :D
---
Nope. Seek help.

Yes pointing out that people are bitching is bitching. What a big brain argument. You must be high IQ. You're truly better cause you bitch at people bitching about people bitching.
---
This will not affect me.
---
I hate you
---
Just make sure to download one of the alpha versions as the current release doesn't work, but I've been using an alpha build without issue
---
Haha no but that just means your a good dude ! Keep the buffs going ;)
---
I wonder if Screech is affected by it too since it does the same thing.
---

---
I'm questing in searing gorge, is there something which tells me how much these items which I am getting from mobs in the AH?
---
You literally started this conversation by calling me a shitty person because you disapprove of my behavior in a video game.
---
Not on my pc right now and this phone sucks So I can't tell ya 
---
But I just Google for a wow translator and it's one of the first options. 
---
It only showed how to type things out. It's all like numbers and special characters.  I ended up using Google translate to figure out what Tomaz meant. 
---
Apparently there are addons for translating though.
---
Just install and try it lmao
---
Tried it once?
---
I'm okay with not having tiddies in the name. I'd just like to try another entry besides this default one that I had upon logging in today.
---
Probably because 30 year old boomer is a meme and I didn't know that until 10 minutes ago so I failed, and in doing so I outed myself as a 30 year old boomer. Funny thing is I am actually 30. Just can't keep up with the kids these days
---
 Not entirely sure what the issue is here
---
If the whole world is going into the kitchen who are we getting a snack for?
---
Yeah dude it looks like a giant ninja star made out of play dough was taped to a log
---
I love my paladin. As long as you keep a good weapon your damage isnt very bad while leveling, though it drops a bit around 40 you never have to stop to eat/drink and you can heal or dps or tank in dungeons on your way to 60.
---
Thank you for your feedback
---
You’re like one of those kids in grade school whose family had a *little* more money than everyone else so you always made shitty comments like “well MY family does _______” or “well MY family has this _______” and nobody  liked you because of it.
---
I will. Thanks.
---
Right?  Play AV all day, go to sleep, wake up, re-join the same AV.
---
I’d don’t think it matters they’re all hunter weapons.
---
Thanks, I didn't know that. Do you know about Boots of Avoidance too? I have Boots of Avoidance but no offers yet.
---
if someone's being a dickbag find their guild ask for an officer and complain about them
---
My man! Excellent UI set up by the way. I might have to use this for an alt
---
Prot Talent Tree
---
I’ve noticed that’s the case with everything. I remember back in vanilla I’d farm linen and wool and sell it for WAY more than vendor price.  But we haven’t reached that point yet. 
---
I’ve been hanging onto greens and mats on my bank alt. Seems like a waste to AH them now with prices so low. Thinking of waiting 6 months or so before trying. Nobody has money to spend right now.
---
He can do whatever he wants, but it's meaningless. He's just as likely to encounter assholes playing any class. 
---
And the attitude is annoying to me when it's hard enough as it is to find groups as a rogue. I have a hard time getting group invites for dungeons, so I start my own groups a lot, and I can't tell you how many times I've still been searching for a healer/tank when my other group members ditch me, without apology or anything, for another group that would just need them to fill their last slots. Hell, I've had that happen (people ditching me for other groups) more than once just with elite quests in the open world. Happened to me yesterday when my partner for the warmonger ogres in Alterac peaced out once we got there to become the fifth member of another party that was already there.
---
Assholes are certainly empowered to some degree playing rogues with the specific tools the class has, and I can totally sympathize with someone who's had a bunch of bad experiences with rogues. But I also think I'm perfectly entitled to push back when a) it's incorrect and b) the person's attitude contributes to making my own play experience worse.
---
That usually means it’s from a talent I believe
---
I am actually downloading the client as I type this

The M. Night Shyamalan Twist: The force changed name... is Tiddies.

im not bitching though  - just pointing out how you're being silly. Quit projecting your own insecurities about your intelligence to others. It's quite pathetic.
---
Piggybacking here. Will anyone ever want a prot paladin?
---
Not the same genre but  mmo, Travian does this. Each server lasts for ~1 year, the world starts at the centre and grows naturally outwards towards the fringes, and then inwards to cluster objective points coming up on endgame. Only thing is that the world continues whether you log in or not, so to stay in the top 100 you need either a group on one account or to fully nolife it, and expect to be completely knocked out before endgame if you don't have the full support of your guild behind you. Was good stuff many years ago, at least.
---
Not anymore! Hotfixed.
---
TOOL
---
It's in the bottom of your prot tree.
---
You won't need it for a while, if ever. Full prot was actually not that popular in Vanilla. Though it is the build that gives you the best threat and mitigation in bad gear a lot of people just tank with hybrid builds even in raids.
---
I am 3 bars into Revered
---
Alright, thanks!
---
yes
---
Yeah, I think the 55+ dungeon bosses are the ones with mechanics. Even then, they only 1-2
---
Yeah I actually left to it after Cata. Only played for a year or so but it was an awesome game
---
I would rather go 8 points in prot. Those 3% hit are much more useful. Keep in mind a missed hit can't proc SoC. This is also the main issue with Ret leveling in my opinion. You're kinda forced to only fight green to same level mobs max. Anything higher will have your leveling speed drop much faster then other classes.
---
I usually change upon 40 to either full prot for AOE leveling or 21p holy and rest ret for still capable questing with a larger helping of dungeon healing.
---
I'm no LFR raider, I'm no Mythic raider either, but I cleared every Heroic raid from WoD to the first raid of BfA after which I quit. 
---
I deleted my comment because I didn't want to post a long paragraph on exactly what I meant, but the gist of it was that when leveling in the open world and pulling multiple mobs leads to decision making about when to switch targets, when to use a CC ability, when to realize I'm fucked and just vanish. As opposed to my retail fury warrior when I use pretty much the same rotation in every situation with little to no consequence for making a wrong decision.
---
Didn't have issues with it so far, I don't understand why it doesn't makes sense to you.
---
Depends an class/spec.
---
Locks depending on activity have quite a decent amount of ability clicking for example, what with microing the pet, maintaining dots, timing life tap/drain life, fear juggling, etc...Back in vanilla I was jelly at how simple shadowpriests had it.  Around WotLK/Cata Lock has so much going on that I started rolling other classes for PvP to avoid carpal tunnel.
---
Rotations were more fun when the game wasn't purely balanced around them.
---
I think they should do BC expansion after some time of classic,  then maybe branch off and go a different path with new expansions. Learning from the mistakes they made post BC and keep the “immersion” everyone loves.
---
Ok, Alex Jones.
---
In retail it just feels like I don't have to put as much effort into building a good character and the spell rotations don't require as much thinking. It's like... Mindless. Granted I didn't spend more than 3 weeks or so playing BFA but... Combat was not very exciting. It just felt like something that was in the way of the other things the game wanted me to do. Which is fine Questing is more of a focus in retail now. It's just you can play any class and quest. Plus even though a lot has stayed similar it just feels like the warlock has less to do. 
---
Classic warlock I feel like I need to be focused. Managing my pet, my rotations, my soul shards and all that. There are things only I can do as a lock. Like summon people or hand out health stones. I just feel like there is more to warlocks in Classic-WotLK than there is in retail. Wow really streamlined the Warlock and in doing so stripped a lot of their personality as a class.
---
OK
---
In the first few weeks, I did manage to do this in order to make a few coppers as profit. Prices were so low that people undercut each other to below vendor prices on linen
---
Even in SM, I found switching to 1h/shield to be useful against Myrmidons, or especially large pulls.
---
Oh, and being able to switch to 1h/shield so you can interrupt heals is invaluable (I made a shield bash macro and shield block macro that automatically equips the 1h/shield, though keep in mind weapon swapping takes a GCD).  You're higher lvl than I, but I'd say it's worth it.  If not for the mitigation then for the important abilities it provides.  I'll often switch back and forth between SnB and 2h multiple times in a pull.
---
I'd argue you're better at dungeons than warriors while leveling.  I have literally 0 issues tanking as a druid.
---
My suggestion is thunderfurry!  I think we've had like 2-3 queues on like Friday evening and even then some one posted a screen shot it was like 50 people in line.  It's the perfect balance.  Plus it's still growing. High population and a really healthy balance unless alot of horde heave servers.
---
Disappointingly short if you don't work out regularly
---
I dont remeber the last time someone fed my ego so hard online. Telling me something I'm doing is impossible I'm doing it lol. Keep feeding my ego lol
---
alliance warrior, i ignore every horde except warlock. I charge straight thru them even tho  i know i'll get kileld and perma feared
---
Meh. My rotation in legion was to apply a dot that had to always be there because reasons, spam resource builders, use procs when available, then my resource spender once I spammed the low damage builder enough. Sure more to do but just as boring.
---
its called BadBoy something i think. its on twitch
---
This is insane! Should post this to r/natureismetal
---
My steam name has Tiddies. My Ubisoft account for Rainbow 6 has tiddies. My usernames in indie games or other MMO's (Tera, BDO) has tiddies. It's the same username I use for a bunch of games as a funny screen name, consistent across most games.
---
The only times I've had a problem before are on consoles, and now here.
---
I took the picture in Snapchat to send to my friends. Then I just saved it and posted here. God people like you are the most annoying. Can you actually not read it if it isn’t a screenshot?
---
I hope you never need a lock to summon you somewhere.
---
Be a kitty if that's what you want. Endgame raiding is not going to be as lucrative this time around as it was in Vanilla. At least maybe not until the first few weeks of Naxx &amp; AQ40 progression. People have been clearing Vanilla raids pre-60, and even 10-manning Rag with 60's. Every class and every spec is going to be viable endgame. People might only be picky for the first clear or two, but these raids are not like they were in 2006 for many reasons.
---
So, play what you want. You'll find spots. People will ease up with their raid requirements quickly.
---
The Rogue's Path, yeah..
---
Because 
---
retail = bad and easy
---
Classic = good and hard
---
At least that's what this sub believes
---
Gotta spec for it. Gets easier at high levels.
---
How does me snatching up quest items as efficiently as possible actually impact you in any meaningful way?
---
No one is entitled to any nodes until they actually harvest it. I've had plently of nodes mined in front of me while I am clearing a mob. If that is enough to make you angry then maybe MMOs are not for you.
---
I played late vanilla (was lvl 48 when TBC came out) but it's purely just the person I am. I just expect better from people when I shouldn't.
---
Im on Mograine which is a really full server. You should try the addon, its called badboy i think and is on twitch
---
It is only more complex because ppl can now see everything and they expect you to perform 100% and if you dont you are shamed...it is so stupid and in all the wrong ways
---
Cowardly warlock!
---
The check mark to the right of the quest log
---
It's a buff so it should work.
---
I don't advise going to STV unless you're not on a pvp server or are a Rogue/Feral Druid. It's the most notorious zone in the entire game for wpvp and as a result isn't a very good place for xp because of how often you'll be in fights with other players or running back to your body after being ganked.
---
Shield Slam is a 31-point Protection talent. So you'll have to be at least level 40 to talent it and thus gain the base ability. The higher ranks are listed at the trainer because you pay for those, but you still have to get the talent for the base ability first.
---
 Cheers for the comments everyone. I thought my ass was gonna be put on blast with negativity but you all pitched in so constructively. I think I'm going to wait until the AQ phase where I can apologize to master for going all out, just this once.
---
the "storytelling"/questing isn't as good and there is no over-arcing storyline, quests are just an excuse to grind mobs but it's alright. it's a lot less convenient but the world is massive compared to swtor's little zones that act as walled off questing areas
---
there's more variation in what the world looks like too.
---
My lvl 35 warrior friend says it got fun around 33 lol
---
without getting into the whole subjective 'do you find pressing X more fun than Y' , i'll just say that in classic-wotlk, you play a class. Cata onwards you play a spec. 
---
Its nice being rewarded with ice barrier for going deep into the frost mage tree, but if i don't put a point into frost at all, i'm not going to lose my ability to cast frostbolt. You do in retail.
---
No. Its just plain and simple Brakum
---
If it wasn't meaningful then why would you bother doing it?
---
Unfortunately it doesn't show where the players are from which is what I'm looking for. 
---
I know this is a bizzarre question but for some reason the majority of the 'English' server players I know of aren't so.
---
World first ragnaros was after 2 months in vanilla. 
---
Just having efficient routes for leveling makes a huge difference. Back then nobody knew how to level efficiently.
---
Also knowing all of the mechanics of the fights is a pretty big help.
---
I bet you're a gas at parties
---
Not to take away from your post at all, but hopefully someone can help with my question as well.
---
I already have macros to change between forms with single key presses/auto charge/powershift. But is there a way to make it so my shift to cat form from every other form can also be used to cancel my cat (or bear i guess sonce i could apply it to either) form if im currently in it?
---
As if now i am either right clicking the buff for cat form or using a macro i made for casting rebirth or rejuvenation from a form.
---
Cheers for the reply guys
---
Honestly I would get used to this as a rogue. Even when you get a group the hunter or warrior will probably roll against you too.
---
They should take the stick out of their ass.
---
It’s not going to happen every time, but there is the possibility. With RDF there is really no opportunity for anything like that.
---
If you click the combat log next on the chat box you can see how much each individual tick is granting your pet.
---
Once the happiness starts increasing by 0.7 you know you’ve hit the happiness cap!
---
Absolutely perfect description.  This is exactly how I feel. 
---
You are there to explore.  Experience the world, and take part of something bigger than yourself. It’s more selfless than selfish. 
---
You are part of something much larger than yourself and you experience this on a daily basis. 
---
In retail, it’s fast-paced, and grind fast. Ricky Bobby’s Dad said it best. “If you’re not first, you’re last”.
---
huh? Im pretty sure everyone uses /world.
---
Abit of jumping in Loch Modan, climb over some mountains, check out the ironforge airport on the way and then fall down towards wetlands.
---
I dont remember the exact spot but thats how i did it.
---
Pretty sure they have already said that they didn't have it exact. They got a version of pre-BC code off of a retired server from that era and did some reverse engineering and research to get it as close to vanilla 1.12  as they could with some few allowances.
---
If you think there is a better experience on a private server maybe that should be what you seek out. It would even be free I am guessing.
---
bahahahahaha I LOVE THIS
---
Oh so I’m being greedy because I think everyone should get a fair shot at the chest, but the rogue who wants all locked chests to themselves isn’t greedy, is that it? Sorry the rogue had to spend 20 minutes picking respawning boxes while they killed mobs. That doesn’t make them entitled to every locked chest in the dungeon. The simple solution here is just to screen incoming rogues about what they are or aren’t willing to do, and simply not inviting the ones who want all of the chests.
---
And as a 60 warlock your optimal rotation will be one button
---
One thing I havent seen mentiomed yet is to send your pet to attack the mob first (unless its positioned near other mobs).  This gets higher pet uptime relative to you and your pet will hold agro longer. If just relying on defensive mode your pet wont attack back till you get hit.
---
wait, you're telling me dps needs to wait a bit before dps`ing? this isn't like retail? what?
---
Responding to the title. Human Nature.
---
Because people are stupid.
---
I'm truly at a loss as to what your point here is.
---
Healing, CC, and tanking don't matter?
---
4/5 HotW with roots, insect swarm, and NS?  Did you go for imp MotW or Furor?
---
hey man i am horde and im not bisexual or whiny :(
---
my wife's boyfriend is tho...
---
I'm 41. Horde are scumbags.
---
Dire Maul at level 27? Kappa
---
I highly recommend playing a warlock. The progression is nice, you’re constantly getting new abilities and new pets to play around with (don’t get sucked into the VW trap, it really falls off after lvl 30). There are so many different ways to play as well. You can VW multidot and juggle enemies, you can use the imp triangle formation and drain tank, succubus subs in real nice too. While leveling when no one else has gear you are insanely overpowered PVP wise, any melee class that tries to gank you has absolutely no chance at all. There are so many tools to get you out of sticky situations. Overall the class is a blast to play and the overall theme of being a shady mage is fleshed out so well, the RP potential is huge. I’ve always played melee classes but switched it up for classic and I’m so happy that I did.
---
!remindme 5 hours
---
&gt;without any form of argument
---
It's like you didn't read my post.
---
Exactly.  I'm Skinning and Herbalism so I can't do shit with anything.
---
The correct word is “hack,” right?
---
You literally signed up to play classic.  Server specific BGs are one of the major pillars of the classic community that made the game so special.   Don't want people to enjoy that because you don't want to wait?  Feel free to hit up retail again.
---
I know the post you are thinking about and it was about the rumored layer hopping addon. 
---
All they said was that /who will not help you hop layers because it shows people from all layers
---
census addon does exactly what it says - an accurate census of the current online players.
---
Use a normal key as a modifier? I dont think so
---
what did you use to look up the server demographics?
---
Oh dear, thank you for pointing out that error! Sorry for the slow response. I'll update the OP. That is definitely a change on Blizzard's end, because they remove aquatic form and combined it with travel form. I believe it used to be form 2 because you got it second.
---
Yep, druids are terrible, nothing to see here folks!
---
Rip shamans :c
---
Lul are you in alliance? I saw a group of alliance running from a 33 uhh most of them were 28-30. I think u can take 1 33
---
The first time I quit WoW was because of Cross-Server BG's. Rivalries were what made pvp so fun imo. And people are smoking crack if they remember huge que times on anything but AV.
---
I did the grind for rank 14 for 4mo and most of that was actually spent in BG's, sure AV had a long que, but you also had some games that last 24hrs or more.
---
I care a bit because, after all, It can affect us all.
---
My main is a warlock so I have those under control, thanks.
---
You've got 6 seconds to run 40 yards with hamstring.
---
if for whatever reason I catch up to you with an intercept you're guaranteed dead.
---
idgi
---
Same plus auctionator. One thing I personally like about retail is the story delivery during leveling. It holds your hand, but it's pretty streamlined. I'm collecting zhevra hooves for a greater purpose other than some random asshole wanting them.
---
And this is why Blizzard's approach was terrible. They thought players would evenly distribute themselves evenly as more servers were opened. They could have had 25 balanced servers. Now they have 10 super full servers. 10 okay. and 20 useless servers.
---
The most important area to get correct and they fucked up big time. I used to support this company's process but now I just question every decision they make.
---
Because it's one of the MAJOR pillars of the community. It's how you learn about the opposite faction guilds, build reputation with your faction, great way to meet people and start friendships...it's MAJOR. It's honestly the thing I was the MOST excited about.
---
I'm crushed that they're not doing server specific BGs. I don't want the anonymity, never see anyone in the BG again retail dumb down.
---
Wait you mean that all the auction houses aren't connected? 
---
/s
---
That's awesome
---
I feel Darkshore is closer than BB for questing purposes.
---
That made me laugh :D
---
For mitigation it certainly is.
---
Uh... if you say so...
---
It uses enchantrix, which compares disenchanting expected value. The information there is all useful if you know what it means.
---
I used Auctioneer in retail but for Classic I've been using auctionator.
---
Either way, when it comes to auction house addons, you have a little learning to do. Auctionator is nice because classic AH has limits with how it sorts, and Auctionator is decent at working within those limits. Searching for trade materials, I have no trouble finding the cheapest per item.
---
Or before you log off, or after you get through queue and can't sit down to play right then, but will be able to in 30 minutes.
---
Because everyone wanted to jerk Classic for "it's about the jOuRnEy" and yet everyone here running dungeons with 5 mages rushing to 60 because of streamers
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejaclassicstats
---
The problem with retail isn't that there isn't enough spells - there's plenty!
---
It's that there's too many damn levels. Too many damn zones and expansions to go through. Even the number 120 is psychologically daunting for players.
---
So they've made patch solutions like making leveling insanely fast and easy, and added a way to easily avoid ALL of it with the dungeon finder, trivialising the *entire game* except max-level. Oh, and they they just gave you max-level characters for free because they can't fix that shit at this point
---
Retail needs a Cataclysm 2.0 (but with the opposite philosophy of Cataclysm....) with a level squish to 60 and a revamp of Azeroth
---
u rly need to go outside more my dude
---
Hopefully Blizzard look into it
---
Lol weird how this is true. It's not like the dude treating you nicely doesn't know it's very likely that you're also a dude. But, it still happens.
---
You're right, the social interaction isn't really more meaningful most of the time, people here just like to pretend that every person you meet becomes your best friend forever. It's true that you make some friends along the way / chat with random people just for fun rather than to get something out of it, but that happens in retail too, just in different places, which, i assume, weren't really explored by the majority of people here
---
The more you can convince yourself you don't want it, the higher you will roll.
---
If worrying about future hypothetical situations enriches your game experience than by all means have a ball.
---
I only want player housing if it's social. I want people to have to walk past my fucking mansion to get to their bitch ass hovel. If they do it instanced like garrisons leave it out.
---
Been that way from the beginning. Still happens in retail. 
---
\*cough cough\*
---
.......NOOOOOOOOOOOOB
---
Woohooo! Thanks mate! can’t wait to get this installed after work!
---
True, but the average damage is only slightly lower (110.5 vs 128) and the weapon is easily accessible.  The extra rage from faster swings leaves you with more ability usage and misses are less devastating.  I did some testing with the two side by side today hunting gorillas in stv and kills seemed to go much faster with the faster axe.  I'll have to actually log numbers to be sure though.
---
So ended up going feral even though all of the downsides weighed against it heavily, and I'm enjoying it a lot.  I'm playing on a pvp server, and having a ton of fun with it.  Not sure what profession i want to end up taking in the end though.. was going to go alchemist, but then I realized I can't use pots while shifted, and it kind of pissed me off that I would have to power shift even more than I already do.  
---
Curious if engi is going to be the same

Very well written. I love anecdotes like this.

I go outside every day I’m just anal retentive
---
Unless you’re on Stalagg Horde, dumbass guild named Showtime started banning and kicking everyone out of the preferred server world chat. It hasn’t been the same since. RIP /world
---
Use auctionfaster. So easily to buy those individual auctions.
---
I think their root system worked great. I always put a little archon in my mage, cause the first few support buffs were nice to have, but if you went all the way archon you got bloodlust. Half warlock half fire was awesome cause you had 18 dots to juggle. I don't think it cost any identity so much as let you make your own.
---
i mean it kind of does, thats why evil campaigns are usually one shots and can never last. If you are truly RP'ing a chaotic evil character, you will always end up killing your team while they sleep for their stuff.
---
A lot of UK players/guilds are on Mograine mate
---
It’s a good thing there is a free mode of travel
---
As a Forsaken stan I can confirm that they're pretty damn evil.  They've been my go-to since I first played back in Wotlk, and I've stuck with them since. I'll pretty much always gravitate towards the "Bad guys" in any fantasy game, so I like that I have the option to play dickbag skeletons.
---
Talking about rolling need for money. I partied with some players and they roll need on everything, when I say everything - is everything. The reason they gave: "Well, I am poor and I need money."
---
So you only do it because you enjoy making other people's experience worse?
---
Bumping for visibility. 
---
Make a post on the forums as well.
---
Not every tank knew about the bug. In a normal rotation, there would be no point in spamming this ability since once it is applied, it doesn't need to be reapplied.
---
Haha i hate when its 2 pages of loot, and the second page is just a second single dalaran sharp
---
How somebody else chooses to play the game affects my personal experience? Not really.
---
This really is the kind of thing you have to choose to spend energy fretting about.
---
This is why I always keep my right mouse button down and jiggle it as I walk. Instant snaps back lol
---
I have uploaded a test version. If you like you can download and test if this version fixes your issue.
---
You can download the v0.2.5a from this site:

Punchable face 😂😂😂
---
Pointing out that it's shitty to ninja items isn't irrational or salty, it's being a decent person.
---
Was gonna say, especially pre-BC. You could evaporate a Mage with a Rogue. I didn't even have to complete a rotation before they would panic and flop.
---
Even in raids, assuming equal gear and skill, Rogues, particularly combat Rogues, were top of the meters. 
---
Range dps just tend to be more reliable because they can be less conscious of positioning. Also, holy shit Locks and Mages owned AoE trash clearing. Can't get around that really.
---
Only in raids, in dungeons you have plenty of options
---
The biggest diference is probabaly that retail has no limitation on debuff slots so you can actually play dotlock
---
I ran uldaman and only used roar for all non boss pulls. Ill miss it.
---
Don’t do it, you get faster queue times but in return it takes u forever to find a dungeon group.
---
I stopped reading at “A green bop drops...”. Why: Socialism sucks.
---
Don't use heroic strike. It's a waste of rage!
---
Right now I'm fully arms, because prot is balls for questing. I'm planning on going arms until about level 50. Once I can get shield slam and tactical mastery, I'll switch.
---
Sure did bro :) it’s massive min maxing haha 😂
---
Honor &amp; BGs. Naxxramas lots of stuff to come
---
You are 100% correct to have done this. Mages don’t even care about stats anyway
---
Think of it, if most of the population start doing this the world could get empty and dead. At least that's how I see it.
---
Unfortunately Druid is problematic until at least level 10. You don't have the mana to cast many spells (Wrath) and you don't have any melee abilities until you get the quest to turn into bear at level 10. So you wind up casting a couple of spells then whacking them with a stick for a minute or two. Keep your head on a swivel and be sure to pull only one enemy at a time.
---
- Learn first aid and cooking at Dolanaar. Use bandages to heal yourself rather than your healing spells. Kill owls to get Small Eggs then cook them to make Herbed Eggs (sp?) which add to your stamina (health) and spirit (regeneration).
---
- Keep Mark of the Wild on you at all times.
---
- Don't be afraid to ask for help in quests. Especially when you come to do the Bear form quest. There are sometimes level 13 enemies in the area and you will need help to take them out.
---
- The hippogriff from Rutheran Village (you probably haven't found that yet) to Auberdine is free and takes a quarter of the time the boat takes.
---
- When you get Bear form hit enemies with one or two Wraths from range, a Moonfire then switch to Bear form and melee them down.
---
- Don't forget to visit the trainer to learn new levels of spells.
---
Good luck.
---
Some guy tagged and killed MY Echeeyakee after I used MY horn to summon it. I hate that guy.
---
nope i wish, it would make my life easier when it came to editing.
---
Yeah, this can't be learned, blizzard wrote the book on profitable MMO's on a large scale for 15 and Counting years.
---
Thats exactly what I did, I'm a level 51 tauren warrior who got his mount at 41, so would reccomend this method.
---
So true, that's how we used to level people up in Dark Age of Camelot back in 2001... It's hard to argue with efficiency.
---
glad you liked it
---
Yeah I had heard about this too. I was told that they originally wanted to do something like wrath (or was it gilneas? I can't exactly remember to be honest) first but they needed to create something like outlands which is on a complete separate map/world due to this limitation.
---
Was waiting for a horde to run by and one shot you
---
come on man, conflating server instabilities and changes in infrastructure with game design and bugs is kinda silly no?
---
they had a whole panel on these kinds of considerations already. thats why debuff slots are staying capped even though they existed as part of a technical limitation.
---
I honestly don't understand why so many people are so hostile over nothing!
---
Sorry I meant after nax is done, there will need to be a plan afterwards to keep things going.
---
The chest event is I believe the fishing is not however
---
Do the server ques account for all of the available layers, or is the que based off of the intended amount of people playing on that server under the assumption that layering is turned off? I've seen people say that it's a que for the same size as if layering wasn't enabled, but i don't see how that would make sense given current demand and the intent of layering in general and couldn't find a blue post that definitively said one way or another.
---
Damn I listed to 10 hours of Dan Carlin Hardcore History about WW2 and this quote was deff mentioned
---
I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that many DPS don't realize that in Classic Taunt is a melee range only skill, in Retail it has a 30 yard range.
---
I thought of 2 more points to add.  
---
* LoS pull. Mark a mob with Skull, shoot it in the face, run behind a corner. Wait of the the mob to come around the corner, sunder it in the face. Number 1 way to wipe in a Classic dungeon is patrolling groups of adds or face pulling a second group of mobs cause you aren't LoS pulling.
---
* Communicate. Ask your DPS to interrupt a thing, ask the hunter to lay down a freeze trap or others to use CC. Talk to them, if they are attacking things at random, ask them you only attack skull.  Be courteous, people are likely to comply.  Its ok to be slow and steady.  If a DPS says "pull more faster" but you are having a hard time holding threat or your healing is going oom, tell the DPS that.
---
lol not having paladins as an option has its perks.
---
You're an altoholic. No shame in that my friend.
---
D3... Had a lot of issues. I always cringe a little when people say they've only played 3.
---
I'm probably wrong, but i think blizz will add spellsword as a "hero" class in an upcoming expac. probably not 9.0, maybe 10.0. I, for one, welcome the idea of a meleecaster cloth tank.
---
As a warrior i like saving scrolls for people who help me so i can feel like i can atleast contribute something.
---
plot twist: the first person to do this simply found out by accident.
---
Warrior tanks can abuse demo shout using multiplicative threat but thats the only bug I listed.
---
Yes to the first question. You have other spells besides frost that may be useful in other situations.
---
You can tank dungeons with a 2H as Arms til 60, the debate more comes down to whether the extra DPS you gain from a 2H is faster than the extra time your healer spends drinking. And it depends.
---
If we're talking level 40 range, Sword of Omen is 1.90 speed anyway.  That's fast enough.  It's better to dual weld swords as combat swords than to use a dagger in your offhand.  Autoattack damage is always your top damage attack.
---
What you got is your feelings. You get feelings based on what you choose to invest your energy into. Do you invest your energy into making friends and investing in the community and meeting people and contributing in your guild? Do you invest your energy in the things you talked about that you felt made the experience worse? The experience? Your experience?
---
You can't control how much you played this game in the past. You can't control how other people choose to play this game. Seek fun in what you do control.
---
As a priest I buff everyone I can based on mana. Warriors need the buff the most, but when I have full mana I buff a Lock and the pet. Pet really needs it more than the lock if it’s a blueberry
---
You do know that the private servers didn't die,they were killed by Blizzard, right?
---
Got it. Thank you :)
---
This is a bit iff topic but I would  like to talk a bit my experiences with groups trying to level fast. 
---
Played in a group for gnomer last night and right off the bat I new we were in trouble when the tank and rogue ran ahead before I entered the instance and could give them fortitude.  We wiped within the first 5 minutes. It would continue to be a problem with them running ahead and or pulling to many mobs. We wiped over ten times. 3 hours later we couldn’t get the final boss down and I had to go to bed.  It was pretty miserable. 
---
I’m noticing that some groups try to rush everything and in doing so they make it much harder. while some have the skill to do so. The biggest problem with the gnomer group was that they were all level 27 which apparently at their skill level wasn’t enough to get the job done.   The group I played with before them moved through Gnomer at a good pace but didn’t try to zerg everything. We wiped once.  The first group had a lv 28 as our highest level.  I had a great time.  
---
I also played in a group that had three mages in stocks and they would pull a bunch of mobs and then aoe them down.   It worked fine and all but they also just kept trying to go go go and it just seems like so much hassle to save a few minutes. You’re not a streamer. You don’t need to get to the newest content. There is no need to rush to the finish line.  I didn’t have a good time running that instance. 
---
It just seems to me that it’s like the guy driving down the road speeding ahead of everyone weaving in and out of traffic just to get to the light faster or save 2 minutes on his commute. Yeah you saved a couple minutes but look at what you put yourself through just to do it. It’s not worth it. 
---
Unless you’re very skilled and grouped with friends that are the same don’t try to rush it. Just enjoy the ride.  Leveling is a basic goal that gives the game purpose.  There are some games that are basically over when you finish leveling and some people will pay money to finish it faster.  It makes no sense. Blizzard has lost sight of what they should give their players and what they should make the players roleplay  in retail and I see that influence apparent in some of the groups I play with in classic.
---
You could be right. There were some good comments here though. I'm leaning towards breaking for a couple months until a later phase when the games identity might adjust in my favor
---
Not for me. Current WoW is night and day different than Classic. For me, Wrath was the sweet spot. I didn't have much fun post WotLK.
---
Three amigos, 1 is Rogue, another is Mage, what should I play that compliments them? we are on a PVP server but will mostly just be leveling and do dungeons if possible, we are expecting to fizzle out before hitting max level. They want me to go priest but I have some concerns with gear conflict since one is a mage already.  What works best for leveling? are warriors super boring to level?
---
\&gt;  wait for actual real census numbers 
---
Literally will never happen. so the reddit surveys are all we have, whether you like it or not, and they showed heavy horde bias on pvp servers.
---
Mage cleaves brought warriors because they give buffer for error. If you lose a mage in a 4 mage group, odds are it was a wipe.
---
People that have jobs know that people dont work at work.
---
Word
---
I did warrior my first go back in 06
---
Solo leveled
---
Soloing again so hunter seemed more fitting
---
Oh ya, I see
---
As proven by common sense, if you can't afford to cast Max rank, downranking make perfect sense. 
---
Gotta love people using black and white arguments, being a dick, and being blatantly wrong.
---
Lol why is every comment acting like OP is explicitily telling them personally to move servers? You have a good guild and you don't mind the server being a bit crowded, great stay! You shouldn't do something you don't want to!
---
Love you
---
I'm hoping to do the same thing. Good luck!
---
Druid and warlock are probably my two favorite classes, with priest a close third.
---
Druid is a ton of fun, but starts out really slowly, especially as feral (the game really tries to push you toward caster, at least on horde side). It doesn't really start coming into its own until after 20 or so, but if you can get through the initial tedium, you can start really having some fun. I could do a lot of crazy stuff, like battle res and innervate while tanking. Low level pvp is a lot of fun, too. Tanking dungeons works well and is a lot of fun, too, but all non-warrior tanks are non-viable in raids due to lack of appropriate gear, unfortunately, so you're pretty much stuck with healing if you go that far. Druid healing is a lot of fun, though, because it's so unique in comparison to other healing classes. Druids are also the kings of gathering, because they can herb and skin (and mine? I'm not usually a miner on my druids, so I'm not sure on that one) while in form. I have swiped many an herb out of a pack of elites in retail, once flying was a thing, and even before then, stealthing in and grabbing things is its own fun (but as a rogue, you know that).
---
Warlock is my favorite for farming and soloing in vanilla because of the not-yet-nerfed fear. I go affliction and fear-juggle. By the 40 bracket, I can have close to half a dozen mobs going at any given time. It takes a bit to ramp up to that much, but even my 14 warlock can juggle two (mana and lack of health returning mechanics are my current issue). 
---
Priests are a lot of fun, though I'm partial to discipline, personally. My lock is my Dark Mage, so I play my priest for the unique mechanics of how discipline works. It makes for a fun pvp character, especially.
---
and you don't have access to all spells in retail at any given time due to the fact that a ton of them are locked behind specific specs.
---
It seems like you misunderstood the roles the game had to offer then. Though it didn’t use the holy trinity, early on the game definitely had roles in group content (namely dps, cc, support). The difference was that most classes could fill any role if they specced for it. 
---
Since the addition of raids, now there are much more clearly defined roles like healers, support, direct damage, condition damage, etc. 
---
Realistically gw2 combat shines the most in its pvp content... there are an incredible number of roles to fill there and they play out very interestingly.
---
Just a hunter so I can’t do much buffing but if I see you struggling with some mobs or accidentally pulling 3 mobs when you meant to pull 1 you damn well better believe I’m sicking my pet on it and  laying the hate down
---
You probably hit the key for toggle nameplates. It's V by default
---
I don't care what other people do, and I don't care about getting ganked. I'm telling you how I roll. It's ok that you play like a bitch, there's no rule against it.
---
Yeah I tried out a new UI. Wasn't a fan and disabled but the chat box stayed as the newer version. Idk.
---
And if you started playing in Wrath, or cataclysm, or Pandaria, or Warlords of Draenor, your experience in those expansions would have been different.
---
Good, surprised it even lasted this long
---
What if they were in a different, third faction, or what if they didn't have shamans?
---
You need a macro to sing the " Yukon Ho " song
---
Ya'll can still go ham if I'm tanking.
---
Who complained?
---
How do we know he is a hacker instead of a GM?
---
Alright thank you.
---
Second one has to be “sry, wrong chat”
---
The demo was on 7.3.5.
---
Not worry about my skill level or being good enough
---
I'm more concerned about joining a guild that fits my schedule and can clear content
---
Idk maybe I have retail PTSD or something lol
---
Thank you :)
---
Your advice is to buy most mats off the AH? On a fresh server? With your main, who is a warrior, who already has a hard time farming gold? This is very server specific, each binding sells for almost 1g on Herod, or it did about a week ago. 
---
It’s easier to get Bonebiter, which through the process, gets you gear and gold.
---
There is no "honor" among these dudes. The vast majority went on pvp servers because thats what whomever they follow did and they thought it'd be cool to do so. Easy kill? good fun. Being an easy kill? ask for help and get whiny. The problem is most people want help from others in the same way that they refuse to give since it doesn't give xp or gold or honor(yet). I'd expect it to get very different when real pvp rolls out. It's shitty at times yeah.
---
Ugh I have the same issue on retail. I joined horde burning blade and half the guilds are CZ/PL/SK.. really annoying
---
Found another dummy who spams trade chat.
---
That only toggles enemy I only have these on party members and only in dungeons I’m lost but ty
---
Are you assuming?
---
do you honestly beleive that you dont have several choices in how to deal with any situation in the open world in classic? furthermore, do you beleive you have any reason to think about how to approach anything in the open world in retail? yes, open world lvl 37 rogue is leagues and miles more difficult than playing a 120 fury warrior at any ilvl in the open world, or any class in the open world with any talent setup or ilvl, because there is zero threat.
---
Honestly I am LOVING playing warrior right now. Used to main pally, and tried my hand at shaman which is fun, but the lack of mana issues on warrior is the tits.
---
People always cry about the same shit on alliance. Just find a good guild full of real humans and you'll be set
---
Picked human mage but kinda wish I picked gnome mage cause I hear its better... Human might be better on PvP server though?
---
RIP
---
1000 times this. 
---
From level 25 until 59 people literally just ignore dps that isn't a mage or the occasional warlock. It's absolutely absurd.
---
This system is actually the best of capitalism. Each party member gets an equal share of the base value of all dropped items. Any member who can improve the value (say, by auctioning it at a higher price or disenchanting to make valuable materials) will get to collect that extra value for themselves. This is fair because they bring additional skills. If multiple people bring these skills, the rest of the party benefits and actually receives a higher payout.
---
The normal system of randomly distributing shitty BoPs is not capitalistic. It is just random. If someone wins a bunch of drops, they did nothing to deserve them. They didn't have better rolling skills. In a capitalist system, they should not receive a higher payout.
---
Before the transfers even opened skeram was down to a 800 queue at primetime. Everyone that transfered got screwed big time. Now its like 3 minute queue at prime time 6-7pm eastern.
---
Good comment, I totally agree.
---
Lol oh man I can imagine what it's like getting a super serious wisper that wasnt meant for me. Also no idea why so many are assuming OP is lying/making this up.
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
you find these people in all occupations
---
Ive been waiting forthat since i saw the vanilla cinematic...
---
Missed the date by a few not gonna lie
---
Server-only BGs can be a good incentive for the lopsided faction to reroll (making it more balanced instead of so lopsided).  I would rather wait in a long queue or reroll if it got really bad then have cross-realm BGs. :(
---
Isn't that already in the game?
---
What? That happens all the time.
---
Thank you so much for the beautiful screenshot.
---
Priest mana burning a mage to zero then wanting them to death is fun too.
---
Don't cast bubble or renew on a tank until he has aggro. Never cast a bubble on a tank until end game anyway. Warriors need to take damage to get rage. They don't have aoe or ranged taunt and threat generating moves require atleast 12 rage.
---
Renewing means you get heal aggro before he has generated threat and the bubble prevents rage regeneration
---
/chat help will give you the full list of chat channel related commands. 
---
I think Blizz also added a GUI element for most of it if you right click the chat channel pane tab at the top of chat window.
---
Man this game... When it first came out I didn't get it cause I knew what was gonna happen. Well Friday rolled around and I was bored so I downloaded it.
---
The first night I downloaded it I was up till 4:30am. I can't even fucking tell you the last time I was up till 4:30am. It wasn't this year that's for sure. Every night since then the earliest I have went to bed is 3am. Like holy hell man
---
Only reason why I'm gonna let it play out is cause I'm not tired YET and I'm just too excited. I'm sure once I've been at it for a couple weeks I'll dial it back to like 12 or 1 am which is perfectly fine.
---
wowhead bot just posted an article to my guild's discord. I'm at work, but you should be able to go to wowhead and it'll be one of the top news articles.
---
For Kromcrush?
---
It's like the only US pvp server that isnt either all one sided faction or 5 to 1
---
It looks like it averages out to a 2 to 1 Alliance favor.
---
Will do, thanks!
---
My problem is named quest targets. I can stand waiting 10 minutes, some a-hole runs up and tags the named mob the moment it spawns. 
---
On the othet hand almost (but not quite) as often we just group up before finishing it.
---
The quest reward weapon is Alliance only, and you need to clear SM to finish it.  SM Cath is level 38 to level 40.  Herod drops Ravager, but its kinda rare and you have to be level 36+ to pug SM Armory.  
---
You can get the Whirlwind Axe as low as level 30.
---
Humans can’t be hunters though...
---
Do you think this is easier than Classic?
---
Just remember, within the first week of classic all the available HIGHEST raid content was cleared by a raid with sub-60s, one shot.
---
Classic is great but it isn’t hard, just more time consuming.
---
I'm 28 and still do that. It's part of the RP, I don't actually hate alliance players, but it's fun in game to have a grudge.
---
Ah fair enough! That's a real shame, always had s fondness for razer products as mine have stood the test of time! Will be wary going forwards. 
---
Sounds good! Does it have a similar button layout?
---
I tanked RFK a few times on my warrior, and I had two enhance shamans roll need on the Corpsemaker and leave group. I got my WW axe at 30, so I'm not too salty about it. However, I will take a lower level anything over an enhance shaman if I'm group leader from now on.
---
A hunter rolled for the SM Armory axe? What a complete idiot and asshole.
---

I bought the game after seeing an old game news tv show do a segment on it. They were praising it for creating emergent parties and synergies between classes because of the effects spells and abilities has on each other, such as shooting an arrow through an ally's wall of fire adding fire damage to the arrow. The implication was that there was more complexity to party compositions and group content because of all of the combinations.
---
I realised after maxing a character that they were either lying or talking about a strange anomaly in their specific situation, because all group content I ever engaged with involved people just spamming their abilities with no rhyme or reason, and, provided they dodged boss mechanics, it worked 100% of the time.
---
Not at all what I thought it would be when I bought it.
---
I love the idea of that, that’s how I always played Skyrim and wished it was an option in wow
---
Herod drops Ravager, but its kinda rare and you have to be level 36+ to pug SM Armory.  
---
Like an hour
---
Thanks for sharing. I agree to some extent because last night I was in a layer with 8 or 9 horde as I, a lone priest, attempted to level in Hinterlands. I ended up corpse running until I was far enough to actually get a hearth off.
---
Some of what you mention is true, but there are differences between Classic and Retail that do matter. The ones that instantly come to mind for me are below.
---
1. Instances. No dungeon finder tool makes a big difference but so does the general nature of instances. Typically speaking pugging an instance is not easy. It takes a good group to do it. A coordinated group. So the risk/reward is completely different as well. There's a sense of accomplishment and reward in doing them and getting something from them.
---
2. Questing. Questing in retail is so simple, it's brain dead. You don't need to think about where to go what to do and there's no danger whatsoever. Classic is different, you have to read the quests, you have to figure out where the mobs are (addon's help but still tougher than retail) and once you get there, there's a good chance if you are soloing it then you'll have to be careful and plan how you're going to complete the objectives.
---
3. Skill Trees. I love the skill trees in classic. It takes a lot of thought to really plan out your character. It's easy to make mistakes even if you do plan it out. You CAN'T make a mistake in retail. The choices you have are so limited that honestly it doesn't make much different what you choose it's probably going to work out ok. That's by design so people don't screw it up, but being able to screw it up is what makes it more rewarding when you get it right.
---
Out of the main specs (builds?) you would play at 60 revolve around your shadowbolt and getting the most damage out of it. Because of the 16 debuff limit it's not feasible to use all of your dots/curses on bosses in raids. The majority of the time fighting raid bosses in classic will consist of keeping up your assigned debuffs (curse of shadow/elements) and using shadowbolt.
---
Level 34, 2 days 16 hours
---
and why is that a problem? Im new, legit question
---
Save a backup of your WTF folder and delete it from the wow directory and reload the game.  Should put everything back to default settings.
---
I have to every day to go to work. I just shut it down and come back to it when I get home. Looks way to complicated and mushed together for mobile
---
Its the same game and more people playing it is good for said game.
---
Since when is calling people out for ninjaing considered being whiny?
---
It's two weeks in. The economies are going to be almost identical. Unless your server has 20 people on it, there's almost no difference in economies right now.
---
Yessir. That's why retail could never pull me in. Different strokes for different folks
---
    /targetenemy
---
will do the exact same thing as the tab key does by default, which is what you're describing, minus the target cycling.
---
If you don't want it to cycle when you already have an enemy target: 
---
    /targetenemy [noharm][dead]
---
Or if you want it to always target the thing in front of you:
---
    /cleartarget
---
The same thing has happened to Runescape 2. We all quit because he hated the retail version and disliked the direction it was headed. Now we have old school runescape which we loved but within 5 months we were already vastly ahead of where we would have been previously in 2007. Everyone was out to complete quests and level. If it didn't benifits your account it was a waste of time (exp waste) They have added similar bosses and updates which are in retail Runescape they are slowly becoming closer to the same game minus the graphics. The only difference is we can choose what we want implanted and attempt to make better judgement than the first time.
---
TL;DR
---
Without updates the game became stale.
---
As the game updated it becomes just as similar to the retail version.
---
Oh man I loved sub rogue. It was like playing ddr. The complex rotations are definitely something I miss.
---
Hey if it works for you
---
No, it was added in 1.4.
---
Grats! im missing the chestpiece and the tabbard. after 30+ runs im giving up
---
So your opinion and frame of reference is zero? Your opinion is legitimately worthless.
---
yeah i would hope if they have been doing that raid semi-often for 15 years they would be able to one shot it especially considering the raid where is by default more easy than it was on release simply because the classes are better designed and there are twice as many debuff slots. im not talking about raid dps however. im talking playing the game in the open world, and by that there is no comparison, that it is extremely easy to play any character of any class or spec at end game in retail. but if you are going to compare the first raid of vanilla to mythic raiding than sure but i dont think a fair comparison.
---
I had something like that happen with another stealth mob. It never unstealthed when attacking and died that way. Even disappeared into the scenery when I got a few steps away.
---
Interesting! I didn't know about the debuff limit; I've never raided. So what happens if all 16 slots are already taken? Does yours bump someone else's off, or does it just not take effect?
---
Hey Zellidon... just wanted to let you know i've been wrestling with this for like 30 minutes.  I couldn't find your config.
---
Turns out I have to name your Steam Shortcut exactly the same as you did.  I called it "World of Warcraft (Classic)" so of course no configs come up.
---
Once I changed it to "World of Warcraft", in big picture I could do the following (once I opened steam link on my phone, which meant there was an attached controller):
---

But there's two important details that I think need to be emphasised:
---
1. The name of the non-steam game app has to be World of Warcraft, nothing else, or you won't find the controller config
---
2. You need to be connected with your phone (even if you're sitting at your gaming pc doing the configuration with mouse and keyboard) so there's a valid "controller" to configure
---
Just want to be helpful.  I think I got it working... now off to play while laying flat on my back.
---
Man. This is. This is really dumb. I am trying to think of a tactful way of expressing how fucking stupid this is and I am coming up with nothing. Its just stupid and bad.
---
OP, you sound like a well spoken and reasonably intelligent fellow, how did this loose stool of an idea slide out of your brain?
---
You won't shit the fuck up about it.
---
I would be very interested in vanilla rift but alas I fear it is too late.
---
It is basically impossible to have a successful mmo in NA without a mac client. You may note the extremely strong correlation between games that have been successful here and ones that offer a mac version: WoW, gw2, eso, ffxiv. 
---
Mac players are a minority, but still a crucial part of the initial spread of popularity. They don’t just represent themselves, but the windows-using people to whom they would recommend the game.  Games spread through friend networks, and that stops dead as soon as it hits a person who can’t play. 
---
The situation with Linux is similar, but _much_ smaller. There are somewhere between ten and twenty times as many people using desktop macos as desktop linux.
---
Any word on Warlock infernals despawning if nobody attacks it within a few seconds?
---
Does the prot paladin talent "one-handed weapon specialization" work only for the melee auto attack damage?
---
Hi, /u/Ec0nomy

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2xig7/so_what_do_i_do_with_these_shards_other_than_void/). 
---
I already told you I don't care when someone takes a clickable quest item from me when I'm out in questing. It happens all the time and honestly, who cares? It's part of the classic wow experience.
---
Pservers Didn't Just Die, They Were Murdered
---
Well yeah i dont dispute that. I guess its because retail wow is completely focused on purely the end game content, but the leveling process is far easier on retail
---
Oh well, least somebody found it funny enough to steal lol
---
Gold seller spam. They've graduated from whispers to channel invites. OP's rather late though; this started like right after launch
---
That's a shame, every expansion has had beautiful worlds to observe.
---
And is it a good talent to pick up while leveling as tank?
---
Yep, the bar slides to 10 and "Classic" is at 3. Although it doesn't increase the polygon count and update the models like in Retail, it does add more ground clutter, sunrays, and improve the shadows and antialiasing and other various misc. things.
---
After you level some more, go back RP walk amongst the mobs outside and one-shot unsuspecting lowbies. Good times.
---
AOE farming was definitely a thing. I don't recall anywhere near as much of it being dungeon groups though. That said, most of the AoE dungeon groups I'm seeing are for SM. Maybe an occasional ZF group.
---
What is a “bis”
---
Because certain people keep defending ninjaing.
---
Well that would be my underlining problem with it so if that's not the case I wouldn't care, but it would also mean they'd have to edit out belf paladins.
---
Sounds like a huge mess.
---
Is this warrior and druid?
---
A totem was just a buff, and we get (in classic) to pick what buff we need or want to use based on the situation. Sometimes Strength of Earth is better, and sometimes you need the armor buff because nobody else can provide it. The system gives you the ability to collaborate with the people in your group and organize things.
---
Now.. it's like you get "buff" and "damage" and "attack" and they are all the same across the board with different colors.
---
See now this is a complaint I can actually get behind.
---
The world changed a lot in 15 years. Regardless of game toxicity is there.  The game setting is not going to change how people act online.
---
&gt; what makes you think you deserve it more than the person who succeeded?
---
literally clearing the trash guarding the chest. its not that simple. you dont agree so its whatever. why hold a genuine conversation with you (my "retardation") when you are just here to bitch and not have any real discussion, just your edgy posturing
---
They just need to have them installed which means enabled in the addon. But others can see your items even if you've used "/iaam off" to disablw the merchant marks on templates
---
You spam it normally?
---
Being upset about AoE Dungeon farming on Reddit doesn’t mean that it goes against the game design though lol.
---
Did it work? Asking for a friend.....
---
^(I am broke and desperate.)
---
Obviously he is making it up, and how is it super serious? And if he was in wrong chat, how did he not notice his text being LITERALLY purple for a whole paragraph? Sure hope this is sarcasm or that get less naive son
---
No I don’t have several choices. I’m a hunter. I send my pet and auto attack. If I aggro, I send pet to aggro second mob and continue on my way.
---
A rogue I’d imagine just involves sapping or waiting for solo pulls which isn’t hard, just requires patience.
---
Why do you hate retail so much?
---
It's a great feeling because you know you're about to have a fucking dope adventure
---
You and I have had very very different experiences. I quit PS due to the community. Classic has a few pricks but overall 9/10 times people have been great.
---
Many psychology studies have found trolls and grievers to have tendicies similar to sociopaths, and psychopaths.  Maybe it is, but it's still showing the kind of person you are.
---
all your replies to people here are lame as shit.
---
I bet you'll still complain the next time someone ninjas something from you in any other setting because apparently you think some methods of ninjaing are better than others.
---
Sorry, I meant the models and textures and such. Compare faces in retail to faces in classic, for example.
---
This is hilarious
---
It's pretty easy to get honnestly, and now I'm 3 shotting every mob.
---
Why can't you? can't you just open a trade window, put the BOP item in the "this will not be traded" slot, and then have the enchanter you hired enchant it from the trade window?
---
What am I not following here? 
---
Enchanting is not bad in late game. Someone has to be it, so I guess it might as well be you. but I don't think it's even remotely decent while leveling.
---
Yup, which is why they make the best shadow priests~
---
Ya ive had to call out a few people for doing this, its very rude
---
Could have called your Tiger “ Harris “
---
Same here. Everyone has been pleasant.
---
I'm currently a level 24 warlock but have been thinking about re-rolling to rogue. I think my main issue with warlock is that I just don't really enjoy casters and prefer the more faster paced style of melee DPS. However, the free mount, flavor and utility are all nice but I feel like I can get a lot of flavor from rogue as well as some of the utility (more personal utility rather than group probably). Not to mention, in retail, rogue has always been my favorite open world PvE class due to stealth and locking down enemies.
---
What do ya'll think? Or is there another class that I'm ovelrooking. I'm on a PvP server if that matters.
---
Post North Barrens I did Stonetalon then finished South Barrens and Ashenvale. After that I quested back and forth between Eastern Kingdoms in Hillsbrad/Alterac/Arathi and Kalimdor in 1k needles/desolace/STV based on what quests were available and what zone I felt like doing at the moment. I'm 42 right now and about to be done with STV and Arathi, probably going to go to Swamp of Sorrows and Dustwallow next.
---
No it's NOOOOOT
---
Should make Bear tanks look more appealing now.
---
Agreed the fix is good. The only bad side is the damage is done. So many mages in all those streamer mc runs...
---
You get intellect! You get intellect! You—already have a higher one, I’ll let it slide.
---
Drive by buffing is one of my favorite things.
---
The worst part is someone stole his stolen meme from me
---
- Dodge-based Rogue tank
---
- Melee Warlock drawing on the power of the Fel to fuck up their enemies (this could be money; maybe give them the ability to metamorphosize into a demon and have them wield warglaives? Maybe even the ability to shoot Eye beams?)
---
- A "suck it up and get back out there!" screaming-at-your-teammates Warrior healer
---
True
---
*New warrior main taking notes*
---
Why would people use privately owned /world instead of blizzard made /LookingForGroup ?
---
You dont generally need a soul shard bag until 60. If you get a 12 or higher slot bag, just keep 5 shards handy and use it instead of the soul shard bag. 
---
The extra capacity provided by a soul shard bag is only useful in pvp where you burn them for damage, raids with no trash between wipes, and helping friends in low level zones.
---
Haha fuckin losers, imagine they started using Reddit too? Hahaha but if anybody's got some spare gold I'm on Nethergarde Keep
---
And yet the OP has stated he already has someone that has bid 500g on it.... So much for that theory
---
This post is approved by Mikeyboy, keep up the good work and give ratatouille a kiss from me!!
---
Not MMO related, but I would murder somebody to see Republic Commando re-released with updated graphics/sound/etc.
---
Vode An.
---
do you really believe a shaman levels as resto?
---
you level as enhancement if you want to keep any semblance of sanity. you take the axe. and mail with str/agi/stam. if you dont understand this youve simply never played a support class.
---
I didn't. I played from beta through Wrath. Took a break, came back during Warlords, played through all the cata/panda/draenor stuff before quitting again. Not much interest in the current expansion.
---
As a warrior I want to hug you.
---
Wut. Ss the healer man.
---
Please don't ever subscribe, you sound toxic af.
---
My experience has been almost the polar opposite.  Horde on Blaumeux has been really cooperative and cohesive.
---
I levelled 4 different characters to 20 last weekend on retail as a bit of an experiment and they all felt so samey 
---
By level 20 I had a 3 button rotation, one aoe spell, an interrupt, a slow, and a stun
---
I looked at the spell books for all of them and saw that they basically follow the exact same progression - you're ramping up to having a 4-6 spell rotation, a slow, a stun, an interrupt, 1-2 defensive cool downs, 1-3 offensive cool downs, 1-2 gap closers, and like one distinctly unique spell (I.e. ghost wolf for shaman, lay on hands for paladin)
---
It is all different colours of the same bland rotation
---
It feels less like you're playing distinct dps classes, and more like you're just reskinning rotations and utility to fit your character - do you wanna play a holy warrior? An elementalist? A master or fire or ice? No worries! Just press these 4 abilities.
---
last night there were 8 sm cath groups all looking for 1-3 more mages. i messaged every one of them and none were interested in taking a warlock because it was "too slow". 
---
finally got a group, i summoned the tank from org, SSd the healer and was instantly kicked and the party leader went straight back to looking for a third mage.
---
The advantage of the 4th spec is that it could solve the tank problem on the horde side, by giving shamans a tank spec
---
Very tru my dude 😩🙂
---
This hasn't been my experience at all. 
---
Hell, I even did an SM Lib run last night with a grade A shit-tier group and still no one complained or started shit.
---
This time around we have the expectations in the hopes and the excitement, these things were not there or were there in different ways 15 years ago. But Justice then, today we are also responsible for crafting our personal Community experience. Who we group with, who we guild with, who we play with, who we friend, who we ignore, the discussions in game and out of game that we choose to invest our energy into all those form our game experience. Mindfulness is more important than ever.
---
Fascinating, thanks for the link. So many of those things I have indeed noticed! Here's hoping for fixes :)
---
It's in the video settings, no macro that I know of
---
Yea they are like a hunter, good to have one.
---
If I want Gouge, I'm forced to play with swords, I'm forced to play without Cold Blood.
---
I'm forced to play without many of the skills I have in classic.
---
In Classic i can have any weapon, choose wether I want cold blood or not and still have gouge. Yeah I don't know I think I have a lot more freedom of choice in Classic than in retail.
---
thanks for the suggestion but ive limited my options to melee, ranged is not for me
---
What exactly are you trying to do? Change the density/how much or how far away you can see it before it disapears?
---
You didn’t disable all the addons because the blizzard UI isn’t present. Are you using elvui?
---
God I love these Pirates of the Caribbean classic memes, lmao.
---
Classic requires being deliberate.  It's not hard in the sense of memorizing skill rotations that you need to mash while moving.  What's hard about classic is being patient and organized, even if in a small group.
---
On:
---
/console groundEffectDensity 128
---
Off:
---
/console groundEffectDensity 16
---
Well you should be arms. There is no reason not level arms these days since the sitting to get Crit hit to proc enrage/blood craze doesn’t work. A lot of the guides saying fury are just wrong. Specifically because you’ll miss out on tactical mastery and anger management which is BiS for tanking especially lower level dungeons if you are fury (and you’ll be tanking quite a bit while leveling). Some guides say to start fury 2h and respec at 40 for mortal strike which I just find meh since 28-44 you’ll be in SM likely doing melee cleaves where arms is way better because of sweeping strikes, tac mastery and anger management. 
---
For rotation, you charge in, blood rage if you have it, battle shout if you hit all 4 party members or demo shout if you can only hit mobs, sweeping strikes if you are high enough lvl, serker stance, serker rage, then depending on your group it will split from here. If it’s a melee cleave with a few warriors and a shaman then just stay in serker stance and WW/cleave. If you are the tank in a balanced group you can either WW then swap to defense and spam revenge/sunders or just go straight to defensive stance if you don’t have rage for WW. There is no reason to ever rend at all and only thunder clap if you have a ton of rage after using that sweeping strikes or don’t have sweeping strikes yet. The time between serker and battle stance is entirely determined by your group comp. In a melee cleave I spend almost the entire time in serker stance after the sweeping strikes opener, and if I’m actually tanking I’ll stay in battle stance if I have no issues with threat and if I do have issues I’ll do defense stance.
---
Debuffs are assigned a priority, higher priority debuffs will knock off lower priority debuffs.
---
You're not going change their mind, crybaby.
---
Not really harmless
---
Got mine at 30, it was a cake walk, and now i am a killing machine.
---
I haven't seen many hunters at all and now I see why. LFG chat is literally just people looking for mages, warriors, and healers with a few warlocks dabbled in to mix things up.
---
I can't even find a group as a healer while overleveled for dungeons. There are dozens of priests and warriors LF mages for ZF right now but zero groups that actually need heals or even a tank most of the time. Never had that experience before lol
---
A realm transfer for those who want to do TBC isn't outside the realm of possibility.  We have shown that there is a ton of activity in old worlds.  Allowing a one way transfer to each expansion would be a neat idea.  Not sure how economical it will be for Blizzard to do that.
---
Respec to get the feral talent that gives cat form fastwr movement. Itll help alot until you get travel form at 30
---
i helped a priest kill 3 mobs that wouldve killed him otherwise and literally a minute later he loots a chest when i was killing a mob in front of it. 
---
he deserves a knife to the throat...
---
Coming from a classic perspective everything about aoe cleave groups and aoe tanking in classic is wrong and I’d be okay with them making these groups have an even higher chance of failing.
---
You reposted a 2 minute old post you shit.
---
Lol dont take one jackass to be a representation of every class. That's classist
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295044/classic-hotfix-demoralizing-shout-roar-generated-too-much-threat
---
hotfixed
---
Yeah, I know about that. I just don't want my stupid face and all the junk around it always displayed right in the middle of the screen. Thanks though. I guess I'll look into an add-on... :(
---
Is that a spear from Wakanda?
---
What?  Pvp in classic is much simplified, that part of the beauty of it
---
Wow, very comprehensive.  Any good 120 bpm songs you would recommend? lol
---
Not sure I understand the second part of the hotfix. Healing threat has been split among all the mobs aggroed for as long as I can remember. If it didn't do that, the threat needed to keep mobs off healers would scale with every mob added. It'd be impossible to generate enough raw threat to hold things off healers at even 3ish mobs if it doesn't split.
---
Yeah just need to start doing dungeon runs to get some better items.
---
This never happens on my server... Not once have I seen anybody trying to AoE farm. Maybe its cause I didn't choose a streamer server.
---
Them bringing an ability back in line to how it was on the original client is #nochanges? ok bruh...
---
Imagine thinking you have any point to make.
---
&gt;Hmm sounds to me like the person who actually gets the chest is the one that tried harder. Thanks for agreeing with me.
---
You're an absolute moron.
---
Isn't intentionally causing repair bills considered griefing to blizzard?
---
I pretty much spam Demo as Prot because we literally dont have an Aoe Outside of Stance Swapping and even then its only 4 targets. It's fucking roguh
---
Huh.  If I wasn't already fully invested in classic that might interest me.
---
"sure"
---
The players don't propose polls, the developers do then players vote in-game. If votes don't match population statistics, changes won't be made. Do you know how the Jagex polling system works?
---
Dude that's honestly insane haha
---
Yup, as soon as I saw hunter my mind went to pet collection.
---
Then you have retadins rolling on warrior loot. Same issue tbh. Heck it's even worse 40+ since then they can also roll on plate fairly.
---
This. If your healer's a baller and you're a stance dancin' warrman you can definitely whip out that 2H.
---
People who are against dungeon finder aren't doing it from a standpoint of "All people should be forced to quest to level"
---
Ice Mage Tank FTW!!
---
I remember it during WOTLK.
---
Do you not know how to use the three shells
---
Ahahahahhaha jfc why though?

---
I went through a few guilds this time around before I found a place I knew I wanted stay until cap. When I put out my LF guild message this time around I was specific about the type of guild I was looking for (active players, dungeon grouping, active gchat, friendly leveling environment).
---
This is all assuming that this is the final version of the servers. Has anyone considered that they plan on merging some servers at some point?
---
I have, as of 1AM last night reached 60 on my warrior, and in that entire time I have refused to level with any spell cleave farm group.
---
Innitially not knowing what one was I joined to tank a SM Graveyard and after the run completed my entire thought process behind it was that was the most trash and counter Classic experience I had ever been apart of.
---
After that singular run I made it a point to avoid any group that was designated as a cleave group, melee or Spell and instead set about building a reputation for tanking groups with the classes that wouldn't ever be invited to those groups.
---
That strategy payed off for me in spades as now on Stalagg I have around twenty new people on my friends list , half of which are druid and Shaman healers.
---
Complexity? There is nothing complex in dps rotation in video game. Sure, 5th grade maths is technically more complex than 3rd grade math. For average adult, there is no difference. If you feel bad while clicking 1 button constantly, but feel good while clicking 4 buttons in order... well that speaks rather badly of you.
---
Which IS reasonable. Vanilla WoW was the before and Retail is the after. People liked how it was before and so if you ask them to point out why they like it it becomes easy to point to the changes that have been made.
---
I don't know much about tanking but I assume bear tanks excel at soaking the hateful strike mechanic that later raids bosses have.
---
It seems that a nerve was touched hahaha. Highfive my sneaky Rogue dude or dudette! 
---
I Appreciate the struggle.
---
You don't need windfury to do damage y'know? Shamans are great but if your goal is to maximise your odds at getting a drop, don't invite classes that would want the same.
---
If it was on a p server a lot of them had it against the rules to mulitbox. If not, it may have been a program sending more than 1 action per action.
---
That’s okay give melee a few months to catch up and gear and we will see more warriors than anything.
---
It's obviously a pizza cutter
---
I played this game as a kid 14 years ago and did just find out this week that there is a /world and /lfg channel.

---
I too am leveling with a friend rn and via doing research found out that the blueberry is the most useless pet. Imp's occasionally for dungeons for the stam buff but when hes out of mana he's not doing dmg.
---
Outside it's always the fel hound, barely uses his mana for abilities, has spell lock, an ability that lowers attack power of mobs that hit him for the 2 seconds he has aggro, and a way to remove debuffs/buffs.
---
Not sure what you're cobbling together, you throw up dots and wand, or throw up dots and drain tank with the occasional free shadow bolt.
---
The only other spells not listed here are scorch, the AOE ones cuz they cost too much mana/kill you, or the ones that provide no benefits.
---
I think you're missing the entire blue post here. Let me quote it for you:
---
&gt;After careful examination, we believe the nature of ClassicLFG is incompatible with our social design for Classic. Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it.
---
If you can't understand that, then there was an addon called ClassicLFG that tried to mimic what current LFG does in retail. Blizz shut it down a few days/weeks before classic's launch. I can't really make it easier to understand than that. It was literally a part of the article which I'm guessing you clicked on and then shut down because it didn't follow what you believed existed. If you have a source to back up your "this addon never existed" claim, I'd love to give it a read.
---
Do you always buy every product in a store to find it being shit or not worth it? If yes then congrats.
---
I watched streams and i saw things, also this friend is my rl life friend and why would he lie to me?
---
I guess the scaling was broken here. Back in the day Demo/BS was effective at keeping aggro from the healers. Spamming it on large pulls should still be your best bet, but you can't just AoE through it.
---
Or jump off earlier than usual and cast levitate on yourself. People follow you and jump as well. 4 people jumped with me one time and all died.
---
Do it. First timer here, you will not regret it. Expansive world, lots to do.
---
Nerfing this won't stop or change anything lol. aoe'ing level 30 dungeons isn't hard, bug or not.
---
Even for more recent MMOs, I was looking at world first clears for the Coils of Bahamut recently (FF14's 2.x raid series) and these world first raiders had players act in ways that today would cause even casual raiding to yell at you to get your act together.
---
Knowledge of how to play the game properly is a heck of a thing.
---
I just went through SM and i would suggest 32/34/36/38 for GY/Lib/Arm/Cath, respectively.
---
Shamans, other warriors and hunters are out for my groups if I intend to farm a place for a drop. Takes longer to get a group this way but I don't care.
---
When you say it like that, you make a fair point. Seems like I am a greedy bastard :D.
---
But it's also true, the game becomes a lot more opened up to you at 60 - you get to do what YOU want instead of doing what the game's been having you do; level. 
---
Could you go do any dungeon you wanted at level 30? No, but at 60 you can.
---
Can you walk around and explore the world for fun? On pvp servers before 60 it would be difficult/ PvE servers mobs would make it annoying. 
---
The game does really become playable at 60. But yes it is also a quote from the episode, but this relates to every mmo. Reaching max level = time to play.
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
This is the real reason to roll a druid.
---
I thought this post was an article from The Onion, but apparently someone /r/AteTheOnion.
---
Does the sensor put your dick away too?
---
Nah, it's more like "all people should use the zones instead of just staying in the same spot for 10 levels".
---
Walking into a quest area and seeing a bunch of people there is literally the same as going to an overly populated beach/pool/hot tub
---
At this point I would venmo somebody for max bags
---
I made a dwarf beggar on Grob last night just to see if the RP crowd would shun it or love it...after 30min of saying “can ya spare some copper?” Or “just a copper for a belly full of mead!” I made a little over 4g lol. People were opening up trade and giving me money left and right (usually some copper but there were others playing along that gave me 6-50 silver and one guy gave me 2g lol).
---
So now I have a dwarf on Grob that I’m gonna level.
---
People did it in legion lol it was a big deal
---
question about questing, i just got to hillsbrad foothills on my rogue and i hit level 23 i only have one quest at the moment and its for level 30, do i just need to level up to unlock more quests? do yall bounce between 2 zones or should one zone just hold you through its level bracket (hillsbrad 20-30 roughly)
---
My Troll would be so much more cool if he was a Mystic instead of a Holy Boi!
---
Also, if Spellsword were a thing, I'd play a mage for certain.
---
Lastly, it's very cool to explore not having a pet as a Hunter, exactly because it's so much core to the class. It's hard to justify though, but you've done a pretty good job through the other skills, especially Ambush Shot - it's like "man I can't have a fucking bear around, I gotta be sneaky!"
---
echeyakee is 2.0 :(
---
I'm late to the party as well and now sad because i have zero hustle experience.
---
Sometimes I like his reactions to WoW videos. He has enough experience with WoW over the years this his takes are not awful. But him actually playing the game, nope. Dudes a douche-canoe
---
I feel the same on my rogue.  Always getting buffs.  So I will always throw a backstab or two on an in combat mob as I pass.
---
Once my sentry totem was gone I knew they were going for no fun mode.
---
Yup sounds very familiar. Cowardly horde doing cowardly horde things. Glad it bit him in the ass this time. Well done fellow dad!
---
A nice guide. But given it might interfere with my mount saving I guess I am gonna skip it. Or do it after mount at 40. I skipped it in vanilla too hehe.
---
Admin pls delete
---
Your clowning, most of that armory loot is bis. On enhance til 50+ and you replace it with plate in a level or two
---
Am overwhelming majority of wow players don't raid, I personally can't see how you play vanilla without raiding but who knows man.
---
ah yes plays the easy classes and complains about complexity, no as a rogue, sapping is pretty niche outside of dungeons as you are going to break stealth with it. Im not waiting for solo pulls, im going to use aggo leash mechanics to separate them down to two or three depending on how easy they are to kill, then use my evasion cooldown to tank them both and blade flurry. Or its a tough mob, i might elect to sneak around it, i might elect to cc and kite it out with gouge and kidney punch. Oh no i have mobs spawning on me do i a) sprint and run away or b) vanish? do i finish this mob off first, is it worth blowing a health pot? (because your resources are actually important)
---
i dont hate retail, i hate class design in bfa and some of the end game gearing decisions that have been made, its made the current expansion rather unfun to play outside of the auction house.
---
Upvoting in hopes an addon author sees this.
---
We have like 5 addons for the quest log (Classic Quest Log, Wide Quest Log, QuestGuru, DoubleWide... and a couple others) but to my knowledge, none for trade skills?
---
Nostalrius had over 200,000 players. Don't worry if people won't stick around, they did and certainly will again.
---
You think this will curb the aoe dungeon spam?
---
DejaClassicStats or TitanPanel have that.
---
You can play retail with an xbox controller xD

Started as a paladin because I love healing and tanking. I still love it, but it's a chore to quest solo and super disheartening when other classes nuke mobs and move on.
---
Half the time I wish I rolled dps because it would be so easy to solo, But then I find a friendly mage or warrior and team up and enjoy supporting them.
---
Wait, you guys *have* mana?
---
Shift v is all name plates IIRC
---
Someone messed up.
---
Too*
---
Yes, YES.  I've been looking all over the place for Ratingbuster but all they have is vanilla, bc, wotlk but nothing along the lines of Classic.  I'm not even sure who the original author is.  I believe it was a wowace addon tho.  Ace libraries haven't been updated for Classic and I don't know if anyone is even working on them.
---
What addon do you use for that GCD bar?
---
Yeah, in wintergrasp.
---
Are they going to take away experience from the people who used this to gain an advantage?  Answer is no.  So they are fucking everyone who didn't get a chance to use it.  Nice.
---
/r/iamverysmart 
---
I would explain the several ways in which you are incorrect, but you wouldn't listen anyway. Have fun guarding your ego.
---
The funniest thing is, fogger would have a lot of potential for pun-based guild names and such (as it sounds "fucker"). Names like "Motherfogger" or "Fugg Off", while not hilariously funny, are still miles better than the racist dog-whistling alternative. Yet, people did mental gymnastics trying to come up with the word "nogger" in order to use a racial slur scott-free, even though nothing in "Noggenfogger" suggests such a word.
---
I was doing some mind-numbing data entry at work last week, so I decided to listen to the Wrath OST. Might be a different xpac, but it still got me to resub to try out Classic (and I'm hooked).
---
Nope. Most of those groups didn't really use a tank anyway. Just a warrior spamming his cleave abilities and taunting off the healer. Mages already have plenty of control over the mobs.
---
*CoughRetpaladins*
---
In the same boat as you, never played and wow before classic release and im enjoying it so far!
---
Oh snap, I got a message that it got deleted since I didn't flair it.
---
You can do it every minute aswell for perma +600 stam per hour
---
the car guy swiped it from hardnlong before he could post it, so i had to do the same
---
Yeah, even though the quest is not efficient for leveling, it’s one of my favorite quests.
---
It wasn't relevant to the post so I disregarded saying it, but he was pulling less than 50 dps per pull at lvl38 in SM Cath when is multiple mobs per pull the entire dungeon. lol  So yeah he was bad at Mage, too, along with being a bad person.
---
Its fun to think you have choice but there will always be the best spec with maybe some personal preferences of choosing one talent over the other and then there will be going all over the place because you thought it sounded good but the numbers tell you otherwise.
---
Put 11 point in Holy until you get Consecration and switch to Prot to AoE.
---
I like the added Int and Spell Pushback while leveling.
---
Great question.
---
I wish I read this 35 mins ago. Spent 30 mins clearing mobs to get to a chest only to have a rogue swoop in after literally doing nothing and steal it from me 1 second before I could open. Asshole.
---
As much as everyone is sick of that go to retail shit, you gotta admit, that's pretty darn funny.
---
Unfortunately rogue and warrior require excellent gear to do well in wpvp and bgs - especially warriors... who also require a pocket healer.
---
Hunter is the ultimate casual class (though they can be downright filthy if you put in the time and effort)
---
drop the loot on the ground to see.... 
---
300 running and jump to grab the item before they can react!
---
:D bwhaha
---
Check with your group, but I always wait to be the last person to roll if a group says Greed unless you Need.
---
There is always 1 asshole that will try and ninja a piece of loot in these groups, it happened all the time. Maybe groups have changed, but I highly doubt it. 
---
There is very little negative to everyone needing, if I with a BOE item from an all need roll and someone says they need it and will equip it, I will more than likely roll them individually for the item. However if everyone greeds and 1 shitty person waits till the end to roll need and wins that BOE purp worth 2k...you are SOL!
---
Your friends charge you for ports?!? That’s fucked up...
---
I knew of one way to break in, but that was before they changed it so that spells/shields/etc don't prevent fatigue damage, so I doubt it will work now.
---
I might give it a go sometime later, but you needed an epic mount and a bunch of potions/equipment to survive, and if you didn't make it you'd have to spirit res.
---
Disappointed also.  I hope the team reverses course. Seeing a specific enemy guild made it memorable. Kind of the same reason the game is better without LFG,  remembering specific guilds and people.
---
Reference client, btw.
---
Probably has roots in the "You think you do, but you don't" mentality they seem to have .
---
I accept you with open arms enemy
---
I bet you're a party at parties...
---
And a respectable answer that was, I'm just saying if you're playing a hunter for a simple pet fantasy, warlock does it like 5x better and you don't have to live through the bullshit management system that is pet happiness, plus lock pets actually do stuff.
---
You can easily create your own group my whispering people. AOE farming is robotic and boring. You make some real friends with normal groups. It’s slower but more fun.
---
Love it.
---
I think mysticism fits both priests and shamans. Tons of mystic orders/leaders/spirituality withim abrahamitic faith (which is what I suppose priests/paladins are supposed to represent)
---
Servers can handle much more players now than they could at launch.
---
;)
---
Aight thanks
---
Im lvl 29 and out DPSing my entire team by 500-1000 in BFD as a pally
---
Shaman: I am a joke to you?
---
We both know that if "Nogger" was off the table, then they wouldn't use "Noggen" or "Fogger". They would use "Fogget".
---
Your kids must hate you
---
This is the same general reason I don't enjoy games like Eve, everything is so massive, there is so much to do that I just don't end up enjoying myself. Now if Eve was a smaller game that only had one or two solar systems and slower travel times between areas I think I could really get into that. 
---
Retail wow is like Eve, it's so large and daunting and it's not even necessary you interact with any of it, I find myself just not having any fun. 
---
Classic is a smaller easier to understand world, but travel times are slow and it takes time to do anything. So the things you do end up doing are actually enjoyable. Like getting a new blue item, I think wow this is going to last me 5 to 10 levels, and that's a long time. The same item in retail I wouldn't even care about since your just moving through it all so quickly. 
---
It's not about the destination it's about the journey.
---
I mean it's great some people enjoy retail, I just don't. But I really like classic and I find myself eager to play it.  It's hard to tangibly say why but it just is. 
---
On the other hand I logged into retail a day or two before launch and just logged out again.
---
Dude...I am in the same dilemma right now, I have a hunter lvl 12, mage lvl 10 and warlock lvl 10, can’t pick which one to main, I just love playing them all
---
Honestly whenever I saw people say this in chat I thought it was trying to get me to join the LookingForGroup guild, which sounded lame. I’ll make sure to try this the next time I am looking to tuna dungeon!
---
where are your pants?
---
how do you mean?
---
What, the text being purple wouldntve been a tipoff, he could've just been talking to a friend via whispers instead of through party/guild/bnet. I still talk to friends in purple text all the time. Easier to click their character name in guild chat to say something private instead of sharing with whole guild or opening friend list and sending a bnet message. It's def fake but not because he didn't notice purple. And if it's a WoW friend it's entirely possible he's not up to date on any new job / volunteer opportunities.
---
Thankyou!
---
I love that the difference between life and death can come down to a simple Distract at the right time. I'm glad you are finding the same joy :)
---
Phew
---
Some elite quests can be tough without tank+heals, and I’m honestly not sure which of the two is better to have with two dps. I’d lean towards tank.
---
I would narrow it down to shaman or warrior and see what one you like more. No gear conflicts either way, sham has heals or can pseudo tank. War for just all-around damage mitigation and ease of getting dungeon groups.
---
I mean, do whatever gets you goin, but melee hunters require insanely good gear to stand up in wpvp and bgs
---
So, on the Leeroy Jenkins video, when the guy is asked for "a number crunch real quick", what numbers is he crunching and why?
---
The only hard parts in classic is a) having enough time and b) organizing large groups of people.
---
The actual gameplay up until AQ40 is trivial, and it doesn't really become hard at that point either.
---
That sucks man, some people are just born assholes.
---
Hypothetical situation to follow:
---
Conroar could not actually be working in said industry and could just be lying.
---
Yea but that’s more for dungeons and raids. For leveling warlock pets are fine. I actually think it’s better than a hunter pet for the seduction in world pvp.
---
Dealing with a pet in raids is not that fun to me. But warlocks have an option to run DS and not deal with a pet. Hunters unfortunately have to have a pet in raids as wel.
---
Wonderful. Thank you!
---
Not sure about the first part.
---
For the second question: You should focus on Reckockning. I don't feel that One-hand makes a lot of difference while leveling.
---
Cleave is took expensive
---
Soooooo realm royale knocked off wow as well now? xD
---
I’m on the same server OP was and have had to deal with a queue all of three times.
---
Spellsword speaks to me wanting to be a battle mage.
---
I'm loving all the interaction that has popped back up in classic. Its such a cool feeling when you see someone having trouble with a quest, or if they see you having trouble, and you just randomly team up. Great fun.
---
This is funny because this doesn't nerf the best comp: 3 mages, 1 warlock, 1 priest. It only nerfs everyone else lmao.
---
It's important for dps to have a threat generation so they can drag mobs back towards the tank and away from the healer, it's very simple
---
Preach just put up a video today talking about leveling as a warrior and pretty much applies to everyone. The key is to stay in the green. Green leveled mobs and quests. Easier to kill resulting in less down time to heal and killing faster resulting in more xp per hour. Look it up on YouTube as he had some really good points. He also uses an addon for questing that pretty much tells you what to do if that’s your cup of tea.
---
You need to go back to school and learn what similar means.
---
911 - a power move by a religious group angry at americans
---
DDOS - a power move by some script kiddie who is just angry
---
See a similarity?
---
When you use a comparison you can compare things at their core.  A terrorist attack is entirely different than a DDOS yes.  But why was the terrorist attack done?  As a power move.  Why was the DDOS attack done?  As a power move.  You can break down entirely different things and find that they have the core of what drives them be the same, you can't be so ignorant as to not see that.
---
What you're saying is akin to, "You can't compare a Tomato to an Orange, they're not even the same thing."  Even though they're both food, and they're both fruits.
---
ITT WoW is boring, but I play a lot of WoW.
---
Well I guess I like the illusion because I'm not spending money for BFA. I'm spending money for classic. I don't continue to play games that bore me and retail really bored me.
---
There is probably a guide on youtube, but honestly I would just copy past somebody else's. You can import profiles for vuhdo. Make sure they have the features you want
---
Throwing knives are faster and don’t take up bag space.
---
I use them all the way to ~50 before switching to crossbows to train for Blackcrow. (+hit rating) and yes, stats from ranged count.
---
That's good to hear. So are you saying that people didn't play at first because of the queues and are now hopping on that it's calming down? We were all told that people would be dropping off in droves by this point. So it's interesting to see that it at least *feels* like the opposite is happening.
---
&gt;I don't know why there are so many lvl 30 warriors busting their ass running all over the world trying to get an axe that is immediately replaced.
---
How is the WW axe going to be replaced right away? You don't even have any options to replace it until Uldaman and the drop rates for those 2H are low. Real replacement isn't until Maraudon.
---
It's funny that people are downvoting me rather than offering different views. Obviously it's already dropped off a lot - even though its still amazingly busy - the queues are shorter and not just because more realms, but because people have already tried it.
---
If there was no fear of exodus, why downvote my post? and I agreed with OP, how will it not end up like retail? very cycling - launch, boom, couple months later, bust.  The community does this, not blizzard.
---
Honestly, as low as a group will take you. You only REALLY care about the first boss (ramtusk). 
---
Really, though, the last boss is 33 and not that hard, so I would say 29, or if you will ding 29 while in the instance and your group will take you. You will get corpsemaker a little late this way, but it is much more realistic to interrupt razorflank (who is a caster) at 29 than 28.
---
40 year plus? I don't know how much they plan on releasing. I also think most of what people really like is in the first 3 expacs. If you didn't want to wait, you could just play on the regular server. And yes, I could choose to play as little as I want, but if I played a healthy amount of time for an adult with a job and social life on the original Vanilla WoW release schedule, I wouldn't get to see the endgame content.
---
Druids are incredibly fun, they're one of the few classes that can DPS/heal/tank in instances and do it (relatively) well. You get heaps of different forms (Travel, boomkin, aquatic etc), a special teleport, and some really amazing abilities unique to the class. 
---
Priests can be a bit boring early because there's not a lot of damage they can output, but when you get Shadow Form you can absolutely annihilate enemies.
---
Either way a Warrior + Priest or Warrior + Druid combo is really good and you'll find that you guys are incredibly powerful working together.
---
No, because that means you will have played one hour less on the next day. Otherwise the average wouldn't be 19.
---
&gt; Because hunters already do this?
---
hunters have poison? TIL. also warriors and palas both use shields
---
Hypnotic blade + orb of dar orahil =&gt; vendor bonebiter
---
I remember my guildie doing this stupid shit on live server in vanilla lol.  GM caught us through chat because we were freaking out that he was flying in ZG.  He was banned for a week haha.
---
Will this method work for Dr00ds too, or is this best done on a Rogue?
---
my old rogue from 10 yeara ago during vanilla, can evaporate mages 2 shot, ambush + backstab. Holding mc rag dagger and t1 set
---
lol I don't know if you have downs or what but I encourage you to reread this exchange and see if you can figure out why my opinion of you is so low.
---
Aaaaaaaand getting rid of that shit.
---
Noggenfogger currently has 17k alliance and 37k horde. That is one of the smallest alliance pop, and one of the most brutal faction balance out of all PvP servers in EU ;/
---
I was almost didn't play for the first month to let things normalize..... That way gathering professions actually made money, and rare boe drops are actually worth gold....... But I got sick the day before launch so was home all day so decided to play
---
Currently level 36 - leveled Ret to 35 then respecced to Protection. No noticable difference in leveling speed. Still relying mostly on auto attacks and seal damage which means with the same weapon as before, i am killing mobs at the same speed. Admittedly SoCom does speed things up a little bit, and Pursuit of justice is a 8% time saved literally. But in the grand scheme of things, the speed is essentially the same. If anything, my downtime is lessened. I would imagine the same can be said for holy.
---
Mate, it was perfect.
---
I second that. Everyone is chill Ali side here. No queues.
---
Is it really? I feel that I’m killing mobs really efficiently without it, and my uptime is already damn near 100%.
---
invite asmonlayer pls
---
Just gotta form your own groups. I've only had trouble finding tanks, which is nothing new.
---
Yep didnt know that, uninstalling
---
Recording hurts my eyes
---
Running down the road towards The Crossroads in my priest, I see a mage running the opposite direction, so I buff him and be on my way, a min later In crossroads I get an Arcane intellect, turn around and that same mage /waves me and off he heads, that guy turned around and chased me down just to buff me
---
 I love this community sometimes
---
Lol did you literally just look at what was posted today and put everything in the bingo card? Cause I've seen all of these today.
---
Yes, but it's not worth the prices people are actually paying. You don't need it for progression because a better TPS weapon would be better and Feral Tank uses MCPs often as well.
---
Plus things like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18531/unyielding-maul) exist so...
---
Only good set bonus is the hit chance.
---
I mean, they charge the cost of the reagent unless they are going through it as well.
---
With the amount of people doing the quests... I'm going to have to run up to it, fear the mob from attacking me, grab it and dip. Questing sucks on these busy servers. PVP gets fun though. Joining parties with random people to kill the alliance is quite fun.
---
Warlocks are more than that yo! We summon your ass across the map my g
---
&gt; Post combat logs. Bet you scuffed your rotation, sundered too much, didnt overpower every time or not kiting between mobs.
---
LOL. 
---
Ok this might shock you - I don't give a fuck about what you think.
---
id love some clarification on this dear OP, i'm in a similar situation. The book doesnt allow me to unlearn Gnomish (not sure if i'm missing something). Should i unlearn the profession completely then use the book at 200? Just want to know if there is no way to just switch specs WITHOUT leveling it all over.
---
Thanks for any answers.
---
That's what we call ... a real gamer move.
---
Its 30 minutes until youre logged out and 30 minutes until youre disconnected from the character select screen, so maybe. Might as well try it, or you could use mobile data to keep you logged in while you sprint over.
---
Actually. Rogues should have just been a blank line😂
---
I never disagreed with that. I'm saying that when that becomes the case, free transfers will be an option because they won't have a choice not to offer them
---
literally ruining classic

---
Spellsword is pretty cool. Not a fan of any of the others.
---
You could say you found your PRIMAL instinct ;)
---
Horde obviously. Fighting anything undead is basically an instant loss for you
---
Enjoy the whole game. There's no sense rushing to 60.
---
Retail ends up rushing you to max level. Do you really want to inflict that on yourself?
---
Harbinger was basically just (TBC+) Enhance retextured and with a 2h instead of DW, at least it in terms of core rotation (it had a maelstrom stack mechanic), but I loved it nonetheless. I love spellswords. Current BFA Enhance is an abomination in comparison.
---
I think if WoW ever got a spell sword class for Mages it should be a tank.
---
That explains why the only rogues that're ever interested in a fight are at least five levels higher than me.
---
I guess my experiences only apply to alliance. And of course, the huge number of people doing this quest on my server. It didn't make sense to me given that experience.
---
Fluff? Lol they spec restricted a ton of skills for each class, making them boring and homogenized.
---
They also got rid of a ton of cool situational and non combat skills. 
---
Maybe the pve rotations are different, but PvP feels bland.
---
I want to see a butterfly effect. We know the future. We can change the future. Stop the cataclysm before it happens. But encounter new unforeseen consequences for meddling. 
---
All without changing the level cap. Just newer better gear.
---
HELL YEAH BROTHER!
---
Even worse when you've already made it clear that you are polite: stood aside for them to take something they were clearing for, helped with a mob, healed them, etc. Or when they're in a group with you, which has happened numerous times while questing.
---
Me: "Roll for chest?"
---
Them: *ignore and take chest*
---
Me: "guess not..."
---
The mace is Dire Maul.
---
&gt; You would have said "his" first binding drop not "the" first binding drop.
---
But it is the first binding drop, and he needs two, I find it funny how you can't even comprehend sentences properly but you have the gaul to attack foreigners for their standard of English? LULW
---
Yep, different "stings" of venomous creatures that have their own effects. One of the first moves as a hunter you get is to poison your arrow with serpent sting.
---
Lol I love how you try to go for a jab and make it seem like he's neckbeardy for memorizing a price, but it's vendor price is literally in the OP's picture you dumbass.
---
It means your phone is about to die
---
"Luke, I am your father"
---
If you open like that I would definitely go with thunderclap. It generates less threat than demo shout in my experience, but it does give the extra debuff to enemies and you can almost always follow up with a demo shout almost immediately anyway. 
---
I don't have any numbers, but I've been tanking since vanilla and for single target threat generation the highest amount of threat is shield slam by far, followed by sunder armor and revenge/heroic strike are both equal in threat I think, although revenge is more efficient due to lower rage cost.
---
For aoe the most threat is from demo shout, followed by thunderclap and battle shout. Obviously there is cleave as well, but it doesn't generate any additional threat, only the threat you do via damage I think.
---
Old School Runescape btw.
---
owo
---
Cheating an honest man is hard. Cheating a dishonest one is much easier.
---
You didn’t need an OT individual mobs. It’s for encounters like Rend and large trash packs
---
Mages are always going to be over present. I know many people leveling a mage first even if they don't plan on maining one simply for the farming potential. I would say many many "serious" casual players will have a mage as an alt.
---
Is this confirmed to work like this in classic which is on the legion client?
---
Most language really. Zug zug
---
&gt; I've been in battleground and can send you videos of 5 shammans multiboxers roflstomping battlegrounds.
---
And for each one of those videos, I can show you 10 videos of 5 organized players roflstomping battlegrounds.
---
&gt;They obviously pay the 80 a month to everyone elses 15 because it gives them an advantage or this simply would not do it. 
---
Or maybe they have fun playing 5 characters, maybe they enjoy doing instances solo without having to look for groups, maybe they like watching people cry about it on the forums. Yeah they have an advantage over you when you encounter them 1v5, but there's absolutely no individual advantage their characters have over yours. 
---
Either way, Blizzard has known about this for 15+ years and their stance is that it's fair and not against the ToS. 
---
&gt;Also saying you could just mob around with 4 friends just as easily is a crap argument to make because I would bet 90% of people dont have 4 friends they are always questing with...some probably never.
---
I don't agree with this, I consider myself mostly a solo player but managed to find 4 friends that I run around with.
---
Even doing quests or fighting Horde, I can find a handful of people to join me just by asking and usually it works out very well.
---
&gt;So that multiboxer has a 100% distinct advantage over other players unless, like your argument he runs into a group of 5 friends that are all perfectly coordinated like the multiboxer will be, will all attack the exact same enemy at the exact same time...how do you not see this as being a massive advantage?
---
The same way that it's rare to run into a team of 5 coordinated PvP'ers, it's rare to run into a multiboxer. 
---
Either way, if you run into that 5 stack you will probably die. 
---
There is no real advantage which is why Blizzard allows it.
---
Do you literally mean that I should just grind catch for those levels as opposed to questing?
---
Your only option is Windowed Full Screen. It's a setting in Display. 
---
It'll make it much easier to alt+tab, but you won't be able to see the start menu.
---
You obviously know about the queues more than people in the servers. 
---
&gt;	there sub
---
Yeah that about sums up your level of cognizance.
---
This is ALWAYS the best world pvp in game. I sorely missed doing this but looking forward to doing it again
---
Not saying you, but the issue I've had trying to tank is that people don't seem to get that focused fire is key in Classic/Vanilla.  
---
You just don't have much group threat generation.  For anything you want being tanked, the DPS all attack that one target and burn it down as fast as they can without pulling aggro.  AOE damage is for clusters of enemies that either ignore threat or for enemies that the DPS can handle being hit by.  Any AOE threat that a tank can generate through their limited options serves primarily to keep the healer from immediately aggroing everything with their heals.
---
Best in slot
---
Horizontal progression is the way to go

---
Uh? Ecologists ruining the ecology to protest?
---
It's what Diablo II did with ladders and if I'm not mistaken there are still ladder resets to this day and people still get hyped about it.
---
A lot of the spells they added in expansions were uninteresting, or harmful to game design.
---
Just because I'll say that crusader strike and divine storm are extremely boring abilities, doesn't mean I'm claiming that pallies didn't need new ret abilities
---
I've already explained this. One global cooldown takes 1 global cooldown. conjuring a stack of water at 2x per cast, which requires sitting to drink to produce at least once if not twice, is time consuming. Time is money friend. If you don't like it find a charity mage or make your own. Not sure what else to tell you.
---
Well BC might do it for me, or...
---
1)Blizzard buys Fatshark games
---
2)Blizzard makes Vermintide but for WoW
---
3)Blizzard can now release new levels/dungeons without making old content irrelevant.
---
4)Profit?
---
It is truly amazing. I havent had this fun in WoW ever haha
---
I'm just doing Classic starting out, but will expand to retail soon!
---
What if I only have 2 bag slots free and there are 6 items in the chest? 2 of which are valuable and worth keeping.
---
This! Unless you plan on competing for server firsts, top raid slots, and pvp firsts, don’t overthink things. This is a role playing game after all, With unbalanced  but highly distinct classes. Just pick want you want and have fun!
---
Correct! I was probably going to go undead
---
May have been a bot. I've had a few situations where people skin the mob I just loot that I'm about to skin. The delay between my loot and skin is like half second and they are already out-skinning me. This has happened several times in two different servers.
---
no way! I didn't know that, thanks for the enlightenment fellow druid :).
---
Fucking lold at Reservoir Dogs. My favorite movie. Please make more! Also... have a silver
---
Vote other....wow2 to bring retail and classic together after classic plays out.
---
Item level is packaged with the mod - most people (including myself) use the mod for the additional stat breakdown. I cannot imagine item level requirements for groups will be allowed to become a thing by the Classic community as a whole.
---
if you got the zeny, i got the cards
---
Ps give me gold.  Alfbank - Rattlegore.
---
Dwarf master race
---
Get a 2 handed weapon. I’m 24 and have the crescent staff from wailing caverns quest. I’m leveling really easily rn using rend and heroic strike every once in awhile
---
There's wrapping paper in game, so you can wrap items up like presents when you send them out.
---
Honestly? It's probably the server.
---
I'm in Grobbulus and it's nutty how much there is.
---
Cntl v is really useful in retail but not so much classic.
---
Shift v lets u see ally bars like that.
---
Those racing to 60 grinding dungeons are going to be so burned out at 60. Literally grinding dungeons so at 60 you can grind dungeons.

&gt; I charge 1 g so suck it.

nah i just get ports elsewhere. you do not matter to me. "how i choose to play my character" lmfao what a joke
---
So the layering will work for specific zones? It isnt just an across the board thing?
---
Oh is it that time of day already to have this post?
---
You should stay in school because your grammar is awful
---
Maybe it didn't disappear but it was confusing that it was no longer being used
---
I could double check but it was like that the entire time I was an active player - that said I know they changed it from its original form somewhat (it is capped at 5 targets, that change came around TBC IIRC).
---
There is Advanced Trade Skill Window (https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info5812-AdvancedTradeSkillWindow.html) which has been defunct for 10+ years.
---
And Skillet, which the author states they would not have time to create a classic variant on curseforge comments.
---
Our only hope is for a smarter individual than me to update the code of one of these (I like ATSW myself) to the modern API
---
While they are at it, if they could update Talented (https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info12593-Talented.html) as well, I'd be forever grateful and most likely willing to contribute via PayPal or patreon or whatever.
---
&gt; I'd like to know if this was already a thing back in vanilla
---
Was it this quick? No. Groups were no where near this good.. but I absolutely spent more time in dungeons than anything else from the low 30's to the low 50's.
---
Stop buttering me up
---
retail warlock is rogue with mana, they have combo bar interface, same for palas,  every class feels the same: some ability builders then spenders
---
Ok, thanks for the reply. Helpful information.
---
You could stay and wait for others to move and even both servers out
---
15s CD on earthbind in classic is amazing! It’s an oh shit button in retail but in classic I can use it to slow down running mobs on every single pull. Feels good.
---
Those set bonuses are hilariously bad :D
---
Ya I'm okay with no pvp queues. As horde on a very horde heavy server, queue times would be huge for horde, and instant for ally. No thank you.
---
I'm currently levelling an alt. A mage named Burnward. he only knows fire spells, non-combat arcane spells, and rank 1 frost shield. I'm dumping all my talents into fire.  because fire cleanses all.
---
Thought there'd be more Shamans... Also 5% for Druid is crazy low, even for Druids
---
WotLK, Cataclysm, and MoP was the Golden Age. They started mucking it up halfway through MoP, and *really* screwed the pooch in Legion.
---
Cataclysm launch in particular was awesome. Excellent balance, classes were still fairly unique, and the game was actually *challenging* again, with plenty of content. Of course it would have been inexcusable if it *wasn't* good considering how long the wait was (a full year from Icecrown Citadel).
---
 I have a 30 paladin. It's cool, whatever. I keep looking at fury warriors and can't help but think that end game must be so bad ass. I ask myself what do I REALLY want to do end game? Heal or Dps as fury. I keep thinking fury but idk. Holy paladins look so fucking stupid but warriors have a lot of competition. I think I don't want to lose the time I've invested as its limited. Reroll or keep going?
---
My friends recently ran an instance of Gnomer with a hunter.  Dude ran out of arrows in the middle of the instance and then started melee-ing everything to try and dps.  
---
At one point some good leather drops for my friend who plays feral druid so I imagine it has +5 str and +sta - hunter needs for it.  My friend calls him out.  Hunter says he needs it for his "melee set" and admits he steals mostly rogue and druid drops for it.
---
Goram RPG baby!
---
Hey, Blizzard. Stop.
---
Thanks,
---
People making you rich currently -- who will leave like they did before.
---
I don't agree.  I'm on one of the servers that still has significant queues and it's absurdly beyond full.  
---
It's so full that questing isn't a viable leveling strategy.  And that's *with* god knows how many layers.  I never saw anything like it in vanilla.  Even on popular servers, and what I see is likely less than 1/2 of the people out there questing and shit.  
---
Once layering is removed the servers are going to be a disaster with even remotely close populations.
---
You feel like world PvP is missing when phase 2 isnt even out. When its out people will be crying that there is to much pvp
---
Knocking down it some quests in stv or tanaris with some wpvp sprinkled pvp is about the most fun gaming I’ve had in 10 years. When the zone is so populated and your outnumbered 2:1 that it takes 6 hours to get 1 level though it’s time to look for alternatives.
---
No silk bags yet, but i'm close! If you have mats for anything I am able to make, and I don't have them myself, I will happily make it for you.

---
&gt;but i think it is hilarious, almost like watching a truman show. 
---
This is hilarious and so true.
---
I took a break from WoW. Came back and seemed too complex. Skipping a few expansions leaves you with no idea how to play the class. I had to start from level 1 again but it seemed like they added scaling to mobs which kinda loses the sense of you progressing the game. I stopped playing retail before lvl 15.
---
I have never played on a CRT, not even in Vanilla lol.
---
:(
---
Sounds like something Horde filth would say.
---
Crazy you knew what server they play on without them mentioning it
---
I never played it so maybe you all could fill me in, but wasn't that a huge disappointment?  Like it was incredibly stale?  That's all I remember hearing about it.
---
Jaffa KREE!
---
And then you still cast Chain Heal R1 most of the time.
---
truth
---
and that's just how blizzard wants it
---
the problem isnt the tanks
---
the problem is the mages
---
demo shout without mages = dead group 
---
4 mages and 1 healer = faster than a team w/ demo shout
---
the rich get richer and the poor get poorer
---
I was having a blast running dungeons right away as a mage, so I was like, I'm gonna spec the 17 dps talents frost, then swap to arcane for the mana efficiency. Super frustrating how so many people have labeled me this way when I just want to have fun playing a game how I want to play it.

I think a typo you said “falling asleep after 20 mins of classic” I think you meant to say retail based on the information you gave about paying attention to everything
---
Any chance you have a good macro, I was hoping that if I have all 3 things listed I could have a single button that will charge, then it will tclap, then it would change stance to defensive
---
Csn confirm Auctionator works great. Make sure to install the correct version.
---
Nice. The ultimate in redirecting enemy blows.
---
Yeah dude I routinely fight level 60s on my level 35 alt because I’m a badass and being retarded is the only possibly alternative to being a coward.
---
I wonder if they had any idea how popular Classic would be?
---
I need to know what RFD is, I was about to take the sword.
---
Copy and pasting responses?
---
As someone who never went back after stopping (around Wotlk?) what happened?
---
Uh, no. Project1999 (EQ classic server) has been doing so well the past few years they're expanding to another server. Classic models work just fine.
---
Because I have yet to see a single 2h "tank" use it.
---
You realize in their culture they will legit be beat the fuck up if they don't cover themselves right? Not to mention it's part of their religion, that's like saying Jews shouldn't circumcise themselves since they are harassing their dick, like it's religion, they are going to do it, " Nobody is too uninformed on female islamic apparel on this sub. ", It's a bunch of fat WHITE people who stay home all day, doubt they actually know.
---
Yes, the leroy jenkins video was completely staged.
---
Thanks! :)
---
What’s the budget? Yours might be $50 but someone else might be $400.
---
Ravager actually kind of sucks if you're solo'ing.  The proc is wonderful for AoE, but stops you from hamstring kiting or using any other abilities (Overpower, MS, etc) when you are killing a single mob.
---
Honestly if TBC is released, I would like the classic+ ideas to start from there without going right down the expansions. If it were my decision, I would rather TBC not be added, but for the new races and changes be implemented within the confines of the 60 levels and new zones, without a whole different area separating the 2 main continents. I think they could have some crazy good ideas sticking to what we have now and expanding upon it.
---
Send it back!
---
I just managed to get to lvl 24. lol.
---
OK sounds good.   I swear in cata you had to pick one of the three and stick with it's but maybe I was wrong.
---
thank u for all the help friend
---
 ecause you can get WW at level 30 which is a huge power spike at that level.
---
!remindme 1 hour
---
i really hope someone lets me into MC as a fire mage. my biggest complaint back in vanilla was being forced to go frost, as i was specced fire for leveling and everything outside of raids.
---
Might be your server. I'm Horde on Stalagg. I have no problems grouping up with people for quests and the high level Horde have been great about killing Alliance gankers who go after low level players. 10/10 would zug zug again
---
TSM works but you need another addon to scan.
---
Mark a skull and hope your group focuses it. Use revenge every time it’s up. Other than that spam sunders
---
But you left a comment...implying you do care. Interesting.
---
They were great imo and i miss the old DK design..
---
Sadly it seens battlemages tend to lean OP so most comoanies overnerf them.
---
Tbh as long as not soloing current content i don't think it should matter. Some folks will play a class due tp it being op sure but plenty will play a class just because it's fun/suits then and i hate how we make folks like that(admittedly i am in this group) suffer for the sake of supposed balance
---
Copy and pasting responses in this thread to anyone who disagrees?  Cool Robby, cool.
---
holy shit LOL. Imagine taking it so seriously. Oh no me taking loot in a video game gives you ability to psychoanalyse me.  
---
I'll always ninja loot lmao, its part of the game. ez reward with little risk. Get over yourself dude
---
It's done through the addon API so I don't know if it counts any more than, say, the addons that automate guild invites.
---
Yes you are correct. Cats is when blizzard changed the talent trees entirely. But in classic, you are free to put your points into what ever free you want.
---
You mean Chad?
---
I sit on ym machine and fish when its quiet, I am in an IT workshop and thankfully I work alone so I usually have a stream on and I fish when there is nothing on,  however my work monitors internet so I hotspot on my laptop.  Easy money and easy fishing
---
What addons have this in the current patch of classic? I use Shadowed Unit Frames and on live can have a castbar but it isn't an option in the classic addon.
---
I even tried quartz and that didn't have a castbar for enemies. So what addon has it in this patch?
---
Or the pools at the Beijing Olympics.
---
I'd opt for a rework of existing skills/talent trees instead. What I'd do with each class is:
---
* Keep Mage relatively the same. Perhaps I'd make Arcane a little bit more useful by introducing Arcane Blast as it was in Burning Crusade to the spellbook.
---
* Majorly buff Paladins, by giving them Righteous Defense as a taunt (as it was in late TBC) at Level 16, reworking Redoubt in the Protection tree to be a chance on being hit proc to make it possible for Paladins to hit the Avoidance cap, replacing Reckoning with a 5 point talent that boosts Defense by up to 10, and by introducing Crusader Strike as a baseline Level 1 ability. Paladins would work the same as Warriors do itemisation wise. Paladins would also gain the ability to dual wield at 20.
---
* Rather than give Shamans a 4th tree for tanking, instead I'd make Enhancement a dual DPS/tanking tree like Feral currently is. This can be accomplished with a few small changes, like buffing Shield Specialization to increase block value further and adding Earth Shield to the game. ES will work differently to how it does in retail. Instead, it will increase the caster's healing received and threat, reduce their damage taken, and allow them to stagger critical strikes made against them, making them deal their damage over time rather than directly.
---
* Hunters get minor buffs to ranged (better Arcane Shot scaling, no shared cooldowns between Aimed &amp; Arcane Shot, etc) and a major buff to Melee. This can be done by giving them a new melee filler ability, buffing Mongoose Bite to not do total garbage amounts of damage, and reworking the Survival tree to make it more melee oriented. It won't be like retail WoW, because dual wielding like Rexxar will actually be an option.
---
* I would only change one Warrior talent, and it's one that is already considered shit tier. I'd increase the heal you receive from Blood Craze to 10% of your maximum health because the current amount is simply far too weak to be useful at all. This buff would make Warriors far more enjoyable to level up solo due to the improved sustain you'd get when taking crits from mobs. It wouldn't really benefit the endgame because the amount of damage you take from crits in endgame greatly offsets its usefulness. Otherwise, I think Warriors are in an incredibly good spot in Classic.
---
* The main issue affecting Feral Druid viability as a tank is that they cannot become uncrittable or uncrushable due to itemisation and the nature of how the class scales with stats. I'd mitigate this by making Bear Form and Dire Bear Form reduce the druid's damage taken from Glancing Blows and Critical Strikes by a portion of their crit chance. The only option other than to change itemisation was to buff their stamina and armor scaling to absurd levels and make them even greater brick shithouses.
---
* I'd only change two things with Priests. Firstly I'd give all Priests Fear Ward simply because it's such an overpowered racial ability that it makes dwarves automatically outperform all other priests by a huge margin. Secondly, I'd nerf the cost of Smite to ensure that a wand isn't mandatory when levelling. Due to their lack of sustain, heavy mana consumption and the mere existence of Wand Specialization as an early talent, Priests feel like a wand is required just to level at a remotely normal speed. No other spec has this feeling.
---
* I wouldn't change Rogues or Warlocks at all. They're practically perfect as they are.
---
I get the pokemon hate, but come on, breath of the wild is the best and most innovative one by far
---
Oh sorry. My budget is anywhere from $60 to ~$130
---
If blizzard would add a small tutorial about trade chat, general chat, and LFG chat I think it would drastically lessen the trade spam. For example, I’d be will to bet that most people don’t know that the LFG chat is a thing, I didn’t until 2 days ago when this sub explained it
---
and then you run into slimes that put a disease on you that reduces your attack speed by 50%, or gnolls who throw mud in your eyes and give you a reduced chance to hit
---
alright i guess i'll go fuck myself blizz
---
Don't do the melee groups. Join triple mage groups. In that group, you should never be using ravager, as the shield helps with tanking the masses of mobs. Just spam demo shout and auto attack, taunting as needed. The true metric for speed in zf spam is the warrior understanding this. The better you get at this, the cleaner the pulls are, and that means everyone in your group improves their mana efficiency. As priests can then efficiently spam heal you, and mages don't need to cancel blizz casts as frequently or suffer pushback, as the mana cost is upfront, not per tick.
---
I use auctioneer.
---
You’ll see plenty of world pvp in phase 2. Don’t worry about it.
---
This happened today on Flamelash EU too :D so much fun!
---
Hoof it the use FP for 50c. Or be a mage. Either way it's not too bad after the first time.
---
I’m always very polite and ask beforehand if someone fighting a mob near a chest/plant/node intends on using it for obvious reasons. Got in kind of a sticky situation last night:
---
I was leveling a Gnome Mage in Elwynn last night while helping a friend with some quests he was a little too low for (he was 7 doing the Murlocs). He died after running into a pack and had to spirit walk back when I noticed a chest. We were in Discord at the time and I said “oh, there’s a chest” and there were two Murlocs guarding it. I pulled one without aggroing the other but a bear got pulled to me. So I polymorph the Murloc before dealing with the bear. After both are dead I ran back to the chest and saw a Human Warrior dealing with the other Murloc, so I ran up and grabbed the chest thinking “well shit, that was my original intention in the first place.”
---
Dude got mad and told me to fuck off. He was apparently going for the chest too. Tried to explain the situation but he was having none of it. I even offered to split the loot that was in as a show of good faith (two healing potions and some water) but responded by telling me he didn’t need my charity. 
---
So yeah, just an issue of simple misunderstanding. If you’re reading this I really am sorry that pissed you off but it wasn’t like I just ran out of the blue and said “let me ninja this shit.”
---
What they gave to make these people complaining about stealing "their node" happy. It's not your node, it's not your chest, it's not your mob. Fight for it.
---
It is different to encountering 5 players at once though. 1 person will be directing the input of 5 character instantly, that just is impossible to replicate even in a well coordinated group. 
---
If it takes 4 seconds for the second person to attack you after the first see you, that is 4 seconds for you to deal with the first person or CC him or what not. Multiboxer you are getting 5 attacks to the face at the same exact time, that level of coordination is a massive advantage on it's own. 
---
It's like me saying hey 2 raids are gonna race to kill Rag but one is a 40 man pug using chat only and the next gets voice communication and is premade.
---
Getting to level 20 out of 120 doesn't tell you anything. You're far from any optimal rotation or even knowing anything about a class.
---
Thats the equivalent of leveling to level 5 in Vanilla and calling yourself a pro.
---
You're*
---
Also, if it wasn't obvious this is a joke post.  I am just making fun of a friend.
---
( . Y . )
---
Most trees have a spell or ability that becomes available after you put 10 or 15 points into it that usually becomes a strong point in your rotation so it's usually best to stick to one tree at first (in most cases)
---
And personally I would follow a leveling guide on how to pick my perks while leveling but I also agree with the selections that the guides are saying for me as a druid.
---
What class do you play and what specific talents are you talking about?
---
where are you getting mageweave at 35?
---
The idea is simply agi is better than str, AP doesn't scale with HotW, and hit is king until 9%.
---
Priorities should be 
---
Hit 
---
Agi/large amounts of feral AP  
---
Str/Crit  
---
AP
---
The 1% hit is OP.
---
I used to be frustrated with the retail community because I felt they had “workshopped” the game into the ground thru QOL, etc,  and many of them seemed to hate the idea of classic. 
---
Now classic is out I couldn’t care less. I hope they enjoy retail, and I hope they don’t mind me enjoying classic. Different strokes for different folks :)
---
Exactly
---
I got bored of my paladin after like 10 years because legion and bfa ruined the class for me
---
But then when I rerolled I realised everything else felt the same - 1 2 3 2 3 1 4 2 3 1 2 3 4 2 1 4 
---
Same rotation, peppered with variations when things proc
---
I spent more time staring at my bars for optimal dps than I did actually watching the fights in dungeons and raids
---
I'm 27 and I'm arms spec but dual-wielding, I find it's a lot better for rage gen and faster than a 2h, might be worth a try
---
No, sorry, because I just don't use that. If I am dry on rage, I don't want to tclap. Personally, I try to macro everything else so that I have a single dedicated key for stance swap (r is disarm in defensive, r is tclap, and f is defensive stance. So I just hit "mouse 5, r, f", if I want to tclap, or "mouse 5, f", If I don't. (charge and rend is obviously on mouse 5).
---
I would say I'm half serious about this proposal. It does a great job of making sure that items go to who actually needs them while providing compensation for everyone running the dungeon. It is also slow, clunky, and undermines the social conventions which typically lubricate player-player interaction. Just like many other economics-based proposals it fails in the real world because of human psychology.
---
An automated version would be pretty neat to try out however.
---
I’ve seen multiple clips of this happening in the same exact spot on the same mob.
---
My big point was it's a 5 man group. Wether its played by 1 person or 5 different people. It's a 5 man group and will kill you either way. To deal with either case you need a group. So it's not p2w, it's p2beyourownfriends.
---
Dealing with a 5 man multiboxer is easier to deal with than an actual 5 man group. I'd take a multiboxer any day.
---
What server are you on where you're able to *avoid* PvP, much less not notice it? Earthfury? Netherwind?
---
I see what you did here! The interesting part about rouges is invisible to represent stealth. Very clever!
---
Anyone who plays Undead knew this since Vanilla. lmao Sylvannas is straight ANTI-LIVING.
---
&gt;Can I put points in any tree or do I need to pick one? 
---
Most players typically spec into two trees, they choose one of the level 21/31 point talents and invest the rest into another tree usually. The way it's designed is that you can only get one level 21/31 point talent per tree, so for example if you get "Combustion" (31 pt talent) in the fire tree as a mage, you won't be able to get "Presence of Mind" in the Arcane tree (21 pt talent).  
---
There are always exceptions and unique builds though, so take the above with a grain of salt.
---
&gt;How critical is it if I pick what I think is good and not what's deemed most "optimum"
---
You can respec at any time for like 1g initially, so for your first go I'd suggest trying out something, then if it feels weak look up some guides and respec.
---
Your spec doesn't matter with a handful of talent points. You're barley prot. Try comparing them at 40 and see how dramatic the difference is.
---
Zero chance it would work. Neither "side" is willing to budge on specific things. Flying and LFR/LFG being the biggest two. Until the is some overall compromise with those, there is no chance.
---
maybe in bad but i struggle in duels against ranged classes. i can win a good amount of the time against rogue, warrior and enhancement shamans but the ranged specs mess me up. still having a blast figuring out what does and does not work against classes amd specs.
---

Ah yes thank you very much I appreciate it
---
I don’t want to completely count them out but I had a group of 6ish people and I think only 2 of em play... I haven’t been online in the last 10 days too much (I played maybe 4 hours) and I’m level 28. My friends are all still level 14 to 22 and I’m kinda Sad-faced. At least the games fun though and Hillsbrad has a lot of 33+ alliance that like to gank low levels so it’s fun to 5v1 someone 10 levels higher then us and kick their ass after they try to sneak a quick kill :)
---
The best feeling in Vanilla, hitting 60 and never having to quest again.
---
Yeah that's true, I think the only difference with retail is the fact that classic is actually difficult and you have to communicate.
---
I figured as much but I was hoping maybe there was something that I missed / wasn't utilizing correctly.  
---
Anyways! Thank you so much for your insight!
---
&gt; Classic isn't like that. That's why people consider it more complex - it requires more understanding.
---
Haha sure. Do I press frostbolt or frostbolt on my classic mage? Hm, such complex decisions
---
Polluted a river to protest pollution it really does not getting better than that.

Ok, thank you

Hah i know how you feel. Never thought I’d fall out of the terminology and which memes were in. Im pushing 30 too so maybe i was just subconsciously defensive.
---
I have a bunch of macros that make it easier since shifting in classic is so much more difficult. Let me know if you want them
---
Not a question, just wanted to thank the mods for making this a daily thread instead of weekly!
---
Pretty much every class works like this, you have "energy" generators (may they be soul shards, holy power, combos etc etc) and spenders. They made all the classes the same.
---
Ok but I also have 4 120s
---
Shaman, hunter, priest, and monk are the  ones I experimented with because I've never maxed them before
---
My 4 120s all feel exactly as i described above - different variations of the same bland 4 button rotation.
---
Yet still a part of it. Screw those old long ass queues. I'll take quantity over quality immersion in this area
---
shaman actually feels like playing something that needs a brain and that'S why I enjoy it much more than other classes.  
---
People constantly underestimate a shaman in 1on1 pvp because there are many out there that just don't know what they are doing.
---
That does it, my next 60 will be a forsaken.
---
happy i got my yesterday for 150
---
I find this confusing since she’s in a pally bubble.
---
You must not understand context and sentence structure my friend. I said “nothing really to gain” not “theres nothing to gain at all” and then “maybe a useful skill” which applies to specs such as the one you furiously tried to argue.
---
Warlock? Good at wpvp, good utility so you'll have demand at higher levels, free mount so work for casual play.. range and tank with void makes easy leveling
---
Classic is 1.13. Vanilla patch 1.12 was the reference client used to build classic.
---
Sounds great!
---
Any last advice for a good (mainly) solo class/race?
---
god when will you guys learn to “uSE pRInT sCreeeEeEN”!
---
The mods here are either employed or directly affiliated with Blizzard / Activision.
---
No respect out here. How do I flair up?  Is it in the sidebar? It's always in the sidebar...
---
i agree with you. in fact, boss fights where you have to memorize a list of phases that happen every X seconds is just lazy game design. skill should be determined by a player’s ability to react to unexpected dynamic elements. not memorizing 1000 phases and where to stand or not stand.
---
That literally is the case as unfortunate as it is and occurs in real life.
---
Yup! Haha, and I will!
---
Agreed. It is the ultimate teabag

Fyi, JourneyWoW, the player with the fastest solo leveling time at 3d 12h to 60 on hunter (no abuses of any kind) reported all this to Blizzard (raid farming) and no action was taken. This is why he decided to follow a normal sleep pattern to 60.

Negative opinions are one thing however spreading false information to create outrage is a pretty popular thing in this sub and human kind in general. There's a difference between opinions and facts (not using you as an example) and people seem to skew this often in this sub and downvote the people who try to correct them on certain things.
---
Whats a good way to select certain enemies in crowded situations? In dungeons for example it's often hard to target a healer because tank and other enemies are in the way.

Feels like a gimped mage unless you are geared end game.

I just found Countdown to Classic a couple weeks before launch. He has been doing them for quite a while and is still releasing them prior to launch. After listening to the most recent ones I've been going back through from the beginning. Lots of good stuff most intriguing to me were the interview episodes on the wow economy and healing. Check it out!
---
Oh, you meant it was a "lie". A joke actually has the intent to make people laugh while not being serious. 
---
Since you're all about calling people "boomers" and "grandmas" I'm going to assume you're young enough to be ignorant but old enough to know better. Here's a free life tip: Calling ignorant shit like this "jokes" doesn't absolve them from being shitty behavior. I'd avoid making that a habit before you learn the hard way, kid.
---
Being a scumbag isn't part of the game...despite how many scumbags like yourself claim it to be. Now get off Reddit and go do your homework.
---
I didn't go look it is in plain fucking view lmfao
---
You can.  In fact that's exactly what I did, made a /cancelaura macro.  It's just annoying to have to do.
---
Can’t be right about an opinion but it was worth a shot I guess lol
---
Warriors try their best*
---
I'm using the following addons:
---
* Titan Panel
---
* MoveAnything
---
* Bartender4
---
* SexyMap
---
I've also made a few minor changes in the Titan Panel LUA scripts to allow some of the items to "alight to the right", which they by default won't do.
---
Not even that high resolution tbh.
---
dont hesitate to purchase weapon upgrades on the AH , it will save your ass , things also get easier once you reach lvl 25+
---
you either trolling free circlejerk point or are very ignorant
---
I'm sorry. I did half of that this morning. There are certain items like this that instantly respawn and others that don't. I genuinely thought it was an instant respawn item. I offered to help them complete a quest to make up for it but they turned me down. Didn't see them get attacked by the other faction so hopefully it wasn't me.
---
Not worth much yet but let the twinking communities settle in and get gold they'll pay a lot for it.
---
Sorry, don’t know about those.
---
How is Shieldslam &gt; revenge in terms of agro per rage when it is 4x the rage cost of revenge?
---
When twinks start to come out, you will make a fortune
---
Tbc is not even confirmed :) might be c+
---
Trino? They are delusional, as ever.
---
Do you know which addon?
---
IDK, most of the draw to classic for me is World PVP, which no other game really has at a similar level. Especially now with current retail game systems making your gear pretty meaningless in PVP, having a goal of getting sweet loot to crush people with worse gear is more than enough motivation for me.
---
I have a question of the spellcleave, are shamans useful in that technique? They have slows and they provide a lot of utility with their totems
---
( I don't know much about the dungeon meta if someone can explain it to me )
---
Your comment reminds me of the success of the persistent realms of Neverwinter Nights (The game from 2004-ish, not the newer MMO). Each server was a brand new adventure using either official/unofficial campaigns or fully unique "MMO-esque" worlds created by the server host. Things like Turmish Lands and others really drew me because you created a character and played through the adventures that were available. Sometimes a GM/DM would have a unique special event set up that was amazing to experience because it wasn't just scripted in the game sense but also, essentially acted out by the GM/DM and all the players. Once you were tired of that server, you could go to another and start a whole new life!
---
Now this is an answer I can understand, like how I feel about anyone playing gnome, ridiculous
---
or you can just spam your buttons like crazy , that also works lol
---
Change 12 24 and 48 to 2 8 and 24 in your head.
---
taurens were originally going to get a racial run speed (because hooves) and then they nixxed that idea.
---
Get fucked noob
---
You can’t place a value on an item with no scope of the market or demand for it lmao just hold on to it
---
Yeah you had to click on my name... which means you wanted to know more about me. So either you are upset that I charge a gold for ports or you are secretly I love with me and want to know more.
---
Steve is a real bastard
---
Are you playing on a laptop? Why are the UI elements so huge on your screen?
---
Danger Team Go in another great D&amp;D podcast, Its been filling my commutes with joy.
---
I mean, they're not hard. it doesn't seem to actually matter if the mobs are being tanked correctly since melee cleave and spell cleave groups without a real tank are a thing, and the normal runs I do it doesn't matter even if each dps is tanking their own mob (they really like to single target separate targets even when I mark).
---
it just makes me wonder what the point of having a tank is
---
if we speak of rotatio nspells ? it easily trippled or quadrupled in comparison to classic, if we speak of useless spells like mind vision then yes, there are less of them
---
I like my message of "tiny ween" for when the horde decides to swarm me lmao
---
If only WoW had housing; you could have the treehouse fort for G.R.O.S.S. base of operations
---
Dont give it away!
---
"lfg SM cath - need microecnomics degree"
---
Here, take this upvote. I wish i could do more.
---
likewise for hunter
---
Exactly, but geez, when the tank would pull two Molten Giants, I would pop off! 
---
Many times my over exuberance got me squashed yanking aggro. I would see them flip abruptly and knew I hadd fucked up. Ye olde days. It became a joke almost. Like if I didn't die doing that stupid shit, it was bad luck.
---
ElvUI Classic has cast bars, DoT timers, etc. all baked in.  I also copied my UI Profile from Retail into the Classic version.  Sleek and clean.  Gives me all of the infos.
---
Yes. I expect you to open the chest as a rogue.
---
No, I don’t expect someone to use materials to open a chest.
---
Its a free skill you have as a rogue.
---
Don’t like it? Well good luck raiding/end-game dungeons.
---
no one likes PvE rogues.
---
Unrelated, but whatever. Once upon a retail, I was taking part in Alterac Valley battle. And it turned out the Alliance was full of hackers. They used a ton of debufs on us from the very beginning - the most magnifecent of which was the Stoneskin debuf or something (the one you usually got from basilisk gaze). Imagine - the battle has just started, the team starts to leave the cave, but all of a sudden characters start turning to stones. It pissed off everybody, but was hilarious at the very same time. Stoned, so to say, we've been running so slow, we hardly reached the center of the battleground when it was lost.
---
Better dps. The strength equates into dps. Ravager is better in dungeons where you're generally killing two or three mob's at a time. Purely cause of the proc. 
---
Stamina on warr axe is welcomed too.
---
But I thought Warlocks summon a different demon each time from the nether. it's not the same demon
---
Read the title idiot
---
Hmm okay I'll see. Never seen one of them around
---
You da best
---
first row is aggro overall, second row is per rage. you read it wrong
---
Does it say you only have bite rank 1 learned in your beast training book?
---
If the spider has bite rank 3 it wont teach bite rank 1 unless there is either a bug or a change was made to classic pet training.
---
&gt; most fun you can have with your pants on 
---
Join the holy light my son, and bask in the glory of auto attack paired with 6 chaturbate streams open at the same time on the second monitor.
---
good job!
---
after 5mins, the boat took us back to Ratchet... rip
---
The comments in that thread are nuts. "Blah blah mage cleave groups will dominate blah" 
---
Most people dont play that way. Who cares. Lets run instances the eay theyre supposed to be with tank healers and dps. If others want to do min/max dumbshit who cares?
---
You don't. You need to preemptively equip it. In OP's video, Swifty was using a 1 hander the whole time during the duel against that mage. Sure, your damage is gimped, but its better than getting full sheeped/blinded/trapped/whatever. 1v1 if you just stay using a 2hander, you'll get rolled.
---
Which UI elements? All default frames like the portraits are set to default size for 1920x1080 resolution. Nothing has been enlarged; only reduced :-)
---
/tm [@mouseover] 7
---
/tm [@target] 8
---
Apologies, thanks!
---
Back in vanilla, the mage group of our guild made rogue alts to stealth in, kill the three pyromancers in LBRS, and then reset.  Took us a few hours to get three patterns.
---
Blows my mind that people think this has anything to do with retail. This was done on private servers and on live back in the day. Please show me one example of retail where people level through dungeons by stacking mages. There are 0 examples. Even in the 110-120 leveling bracket. The reason it takes long to find a gnomer group is because most people hate it or don’t know how to get there and it overlaps with the easiest and most populated dungeons in SM. 
---
Everything you don’t like is not the fault of retail.
---
Its a term called "Power Shifting," if you want a thing to google around
---
\&gt;let others be
---
\&gt;griefing
---
I wouldn't call any of those aside from Mana Shield "iconic" abilities for mage.
---
Gold seller is character in game; is blizzard.
---
Well, you have to be a specific level to be USEFUL in SM cath as a warrior. Sure, you can try to dps a boss 8 levels higher than you. But it's not going to be pretty. And you sure ain't taunting mograine reliably at level 34.
---
This week i got my own office, but the only thing is the window behind me. If someone walks in they can see the reflection. I need a poster or something.
---
Definitely gotta get The Unstoppable Force
---
6g at 39:(
---
Retail classes just feel too samey. Almost every class is gain resource+dump for DPS. Despite wrath being the beginning of the end for the social aspect of the game i definitely feel like it had a great sweet spot between classic/tbc fluff and rotational complexity from a mechanical standpoint.
---
There's a reason that majority of people didn't raid in vanilla.
---
Most didn't have a level 60 character.  Loads just twinked out characters and played at lower levels.  Max level and raids weren't required to have fun.  For a lot of people hitting max level meant the character was finished.
---
Probably, but it's the kind of thing that happens plenty often
---
He said it was a fact though.
---
stupdi post............
---
I just got it all set up on Bloodsail, and I've got some feedback.
---
Since you're probably going to do as I would and one day forget to restart development and let it mothball, are you ok with collaborative improvement such as github? If you do open the development up and/or continue it, I'd like to suggest a minimap button and "/iaam" for opening your merchant window. I'd help out, but i'm terrible at programming and can't speak LUA. 
---
The drag and drop function doesn't function for me. /iaam add does function, though.
---
Also, will I, as an unflagged gnome on a non-pvp server, be able to directly sell alliance things to hordelings, or will I need to keep paying the Steamwheedle Cartel?
---
Thanks for making this addon. I hope it spreads and is allowed to continue to exist.
---
Its bis for every melee dmg class and spec for all armor classes, as well as hunters
---
Well I guess we just straight disagree on the topic then, I've always had an issue with Multiboxing as in pvp its provided a distinct advantage in any BG I've played in where one has been present. 
---
You can call that subjective, but that's just straight been my experience, sure you can take them down eventually with a group but not before the game is usually lost for your team and they are topping the kill charts by slaughtering waves of enemies coming after them.
---
Personally I wana see a Shaman Earthen tanking spec, focuses on having a permanent earth elemental to help share damage on a CD, utilizes shields and AoE CC. Like in classic earthshock is now a damage high threat taunt, passive mastery increase armor by X per mastery point(if we are talking retail), earthquake for AoE pulling/dps, Earth shield now functions more like a warriors Block but with thorns and generates a shield etc. Could be fun.
---
Upvoted for the hearty nose exhale
---
Level of skinnable creature X 5 = the level of skinning you would need to skin said creature. So a Skinning level of 225 would only allow you to skin creatures 45 or lower.
---
I said i hadnt met one yet. Not they dont exist. I main alliance (because of a shared acciunt situation way back at the actual vanilla release not because i actually wanted alli it just stuck) but i include myself in that, idk what it is but when i play an undead i feel the need to just be an ass. I dont rp at all, so its not getting into charecter. I think its just the dark ass beginning you have makes you .... hate.... lol
---
What is 200% of 0?
---
Thanks. Will keep that in mind.
---
Tank charges in.
---
Needs more than 20 rage and a few GCDs to built aggro properly.
---
Group members don't agree and attack before the tank can even land a single sunder or a few demo shouts.
---
DPS complain about the tank not being able to hold aggro. 🤔
---
Yeah I put mine up for 250
---
r/thatsthejoke
---
The man is not a level 60, healing classes gotta solo grind mobs in the world like everyone else to level. Like as a Priest I'm full shadow spec to level.
---
I'm gonna steal 6 chests and 9 quest items in your honor tonight. xoxo
---
See you out there on the fields of Azeroth friend! From a gnome mage.
---
Isn't Scooty at the other teleporter in Booty Bay?
---
This is something I learned in world PVP.  I was never great at Arena PVP but in world PVP when people jump me or if I am screwing around jumping people I feel like a god.  Even if I feel like I am going to lose the fight I can usually get away using a combination of frost nova, blink, dragons breath, polymorph, invis and then mount up.  Even if they do get a killing blow my cauterize hits and I run away at 584930% and then Ice Block to stop the burn and mount up!
---
What if I'm not a Holy paladin?
---
I think a MC'd player is considered the priest's pet, so it would still consider /me to be you, the priest.
---
Yeah AoE mage, especially post 40, is perfectly capable of solo farming and extra members don’t add much utility to the process. Before that, having an extra body to round up the mobs is nice. Though if you’re alone in most of the good areas, you can probably farm them faster than their spawn time anyway. So more bodies will almost never be worth their weight.
---
Mike Tyson had one that basically meant the same thing, "everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."
---
Ravager is actually great on a Hunter. Though you want to get it in a group where all warriors/palas have it already. You have no idea what you are talking about if you think its horrible, the ravager proc in dungeons is gonna do plenty more times DPS than your bow for like 7-8 levels forward, not lying. Weapon switching in a big pull to AOE with it works wonders, done so several times in Armory, Cathedral and later Zul'Farak on Zombies and Pyramid.
---
This photo is giving me nightmares.
---
Currently a pally dwarf hiding under the dock and I logged off.
---
Help.
---
Stun lock the mobs so they cant cast abilities on you
---
Lol people just running an app doesn't count as a "real" census. Unless blizz actually tells us how many people are on each server there's basically no "real" data.
---
Haha. Solid joke.
---
When do PvP mounts come out? I remember in Vanilla or TBC, I bought a different race PvP mount with nothing but BG tokens. Didn't need any exalted rep to ride it either.
---
Alien vs predator 2 again would be awesome!
---
Kirtonos boys represent!!
---
What do you mean, show? A quiver is equipped like a bag.
---
Most servers have a world channel by now as well. There you usually find those who migrated over from private servers.
---
How far after SM is farmable? I was considering making rogue enc so I can stealth to bosses and kill them for higher up mats, but not sure which mats are needed?
---
Are you able to do DM farms like mages and hunters?
---
Awesome thanks!
---
That's actually terrifying. What? Where?
---
if warlocks aren't using hellfire for the aoe pulls, they are doing it wrong.
---
Probably South Park
---
You see a lot of advertising for the cleave stuff in chat but I've only ever had one Rogue replaced for a Shaman in all my groups up until now. The Shaman's Windfury Totem didn't even help because the Warrior wasn't that good. :|
---
It absolutely does not "go for" 650g on your server.
---
Maybe someone posted it at that price, but it doesn't "go for" that.
---
Believe it or not players actually like to be challenged and not pampered like a child to the point where the "game" no longer exists anymore.
---
Blizzard really needs to start listening to the "pros" rather than reddit/wow forums, like valve does for dota2.
---
Yep.
---
it wasn't a joke.......
---
Horde's story and personality are better but their questing was never as fleshed out as alliance in the early days.
---
I once wandered into Northern Plaguelands until a GM kicked me out.
---
Ahhh cool! I loved my first Hunter. His name was barnabasII. I joined my first guild with him and cleared my first raid with him. Such good times. I remember getting so excited when I found out I had a skill that could make me run faster lol. How's your experience so far?
---
Damnit. That was suppose to be my line.
---
This is why I love Guidelime. If you don't want to party up for an escort quest then you better click faster than my addon.
---
Content impossible without twitch meta party comp!
---
Idk if I was doing it wrong but if DPS pull aggro initially, nothing is giving me rage to demo every GCD and it’s just a shit show. When you wait a few GCDS before say a shattered cone of cold, nothing would ever really come off.
---
Hi, /u/real_rons
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2z3p7/level_39_and_im_33g_away_from_my_mount_any/). 
---
Considering there’s obscene skews between faction populations across the servers, their hands are pretty tied on this one.
---
All dungeon farming groups will go from 50% mage cleave to 100% dead cleave.
---
...slight exaggeration, certainly proper execution can still be done, but a ton of players will now be unable to spellcleave, and the other ton will see such significant reduction in XP from their pulls (misexecution, needing to pull less, etc) that it won't be a competitive means of XP/hour.
---
I mean you could have simply posted the rotarion you claim to have tested. Since you havent, Im assuming you either know you scuffed it, or didnt actually do the test. But I wont know how unless you share.
---
You may say you dont need to justify yourself, but you did need to for your "peace of mind" and came and posted here. Youre also still talking, still trying to win.
---
How does testing the dps of a scuffed ass rotation give you enough piece of mind to go back to braindead HS spam? That is some low IQ shit man.
---
Good point, I suppose I'm not sure how much 35 nature damage assists with wrath and insect swarm, while 26 int is 600 mana which is 5 wraths
---
If you're pulling threat off a 2H warrior in zerk stance, it's you that's doing something wrong buddy.
---
I can charge in battle shout, zerk stance, whirlwind and keep that pack on me the entire fight.
---
So unless you're nuking an off target, it's not the "tanks" fault.
---
The difference it makes in the speed of the dungeon is night and day, the difference it makes to the healer is drinking every 2nd pull instead of every 3rd.
---
It's playable, but it is quite bad in raids and only somewhat okay in dungeons and PvP. You'll certainly have a harder time finding groups than a pure DPS.
---
Collecting all the items that are dropped from player kills to get buffs and summon Lok’holar.
---
i got a ring in ere last night
---
Yeah, those are correct. Also keep in mind that your healing items could be cloth or leather; ideally you won't get hit in the dungeon anyway, so focus on the stats.
---
A person who really knew what he was doing could probably do it in about an hour
---
Some of that would be travelling distances (and picking up flight paths) that he would have to do in the future at some point anyway.
---
&gt; Wand (when OOM and desperate)
---
That's not effecient leveling it should be depending on level CoA-&gt;Corruption-&gt;Imm(optional)-&gt;Life Tap(optional)-&gt;Wand-&gt;Redot as old dots expire. Shadow bolt spam is very mana ineffecient and takes aggro away from void. It's fine for bursting a boss or in PvP but not for leveling where efficiency matters more than burst.
---
Then the winged gm's arrived!
---
Well, I can tell you that data is massively lacking sample size.
---
I play on Azuresong, Alliance, that shows a total of 3.2k players above level 5, where as I have data of over 20k players over level 5.
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/ESMpVgs.jpg)'s a more accurate look.
---
Yes I agree.  But this person’s intentions seemed somewhat malicious to me.  It’s an ethical problem.
---
I'm pretty sure there are only Holy Paladins.
---
Oh I agree 100%
---
Rift's talent system was super fun and you could play with so many different builds.
---
It makes me sad that game didn't get the traction it deserved. :(
---
everything about this is pretty genius
---
What the fuck are you supposed to do then to keep aggro against mages while pulling two groups?
---
Alliance Ret is trash. Horde Ret is somewhat decent in TBC.
---
/wave isn’t the best thing to do, if you don’t have a target and someone targets you, you’ll target them back just like if you entered combat, so a lot of newer players thing you’ve already started attacking them when you target
---
what a...? :)
---
Dungeon grind
---
To make matters worse (for you at least), I think they recently change the Layer sizes so there's more players per layer. Me and some people I know all reckon their are more players now compared to a few days ago.
---
I can't speak for higher level play because I'm not there yet, but every instance I've run so far has been insta-queue for me.  Zone chat in most places I've been has been nothing but "LF Healer" or "LF Tank".  A RL friend of mine is leveling a warrior, and if we are in a group looking for DPS, I'll instantly get 30 requests to join our group.
---
So far its been really cool. Its amazing how you come across some little part of the world you remember so vividly from 13 years ago. What i dont remember so much was how much running around there is at low levels. I must have had a lot more patience back in the day. lol
---
Cause the game just released, a lot if people will be in the same leveling and questing bracket. Not you can do; possibly transfer to a low pop?
---
 https://imgur.com/v5e4eqG
---
Have you ever played ESO before? Do you know how you have to Light Attack weave in ESO? Hunter in Vanilla/Classic is similar.   
---
You wait for Auto shot to pop off, THEN you move your character AND cast a spell (concussive shot, or serpent sting, or arcane shot, etc). THEN you stop moving, and let Auto shot pop off again, THEN start moving again.   
---
You alternate between auto shot, and move/using an ability. That is how you kite as a hunter in Vanilla. Auto attacks are a lot of Hunter's damage.
---
Yeah nah
---
Splitting your player base amongst worlds is one thing
---
But you're talking about splitting them amongst world servers? Watch the game die as the amount of active players in classic is cut in half with people transferring to outlands, and then in half again for wotlk etc etc
---
“Wow I bet warriors have tons of ways to use their rage!”

OK well, it seems like you just really want to be right. So if you choose to believe the Reddit survey, more power to you sir.
---
Why don’t my fields look like that?
---
Why wont life let me respec? lol
---
I don’t really care about the money.  I can get more later.  The helpful actions done to me and that I do to others is more valuable to me.  Maybe I’ll be singing a different tune at 60.  Who knows.
---
First of all how dare you
---
Big brain time ensues
---
Hunters are in a really bad spot, especially in vanilla. They can basically use any type of weapon as it's mainly a stat stick and then they share armor with rogues/druids up to 40 then shamans for the rest. 
---
I try to be optimistic and just assume they have bad attitudes because they are tired of being shit on for doing completely legitimate things like need on gear they actually need. 
---
For things like ammo, no other class has to maintain consumables like they do. Even warlocks don't have it as bad. I can't imagine how annoying it is needing to fill up half your bags in hopes you don't run out of ammo mid instance and then it happens anyway.
---
reagent vendor? what do they sell
---
what spec specifically? sry I'm new to the game and learning to tank as warrior
---
Valid.
---
Being behind the curve means less waiting for spawns.
---
Oh well alliance side they can still use palatank. Guess it will be the new meta now.
---
And infernals onto Goldshire. Or at least I would if it wasn't broken. Thanks for ruining 50+ levels of warlock with this hippie "protect the noobs" mentality, Blizz.
---
Agree.  These aoe minded group comps go against the spirit of vanilla.
---
Quest that starts with venom vials on the south of hinterlands that goes in to ZF.
---
At the end of the chain you summon Shadra
---
Why would you put it on the furthest mob tho? You want the mobs to walk thru it so you put it in between yourself and the closest mob to maximize the distance they travel thru the aoe
---
If that was a ploy to get a better deal on an item that's some hardcore dedication lol.
---
Take my money.
---
&gt;My friend hasn’t kept up, my other friends transferred or rerolled, so now I’m stuck on my server solo with no irl friends, just like the old days. Oh well.
---
Yeah man, I hear you. Lol
---
&gt;go to ogr and see people asking for lv. requirement to run rfc/wc and tell me those guys are at the same skill/knowledge level as the guys doing those in day 1.
---
wow, still don't know how to read huh?, I would give up hope of having an intelligent conversations too if I have such a problem with reading comprehension .
---
We started with 9. We are at 3 full timers with the other 2 slacking, and the remaining 4 chose others servers after the first day of queues.
---
Sent!
---
I did the feralas one last night, and he went pretty fast. Only issue was the last set of mobs that spawned. That chicken gave zero fucks and took off through them. Almost failed the quest before I realized and had to take off chasing it with the mobs after me.
---
Won’t be happening again.
---
You could say the same thing about the people buying it for 300g on your server?
---
Just wait a couple weeks and it will be lower. You were being impatient buying it 2 weeks in.
---
I love giving out bags in Goldshire. There are so many people that don't get lucky drops for free 6 slots so if I've got some extra bags I always spam General chat and the people come running.
---
In the end, playing a class you know you enjoy playing will trump any short-lived expectation you’re projecting yourself into. There are so many people around, so many options, so many routes you can apply yourself toward.
---
I leveled a priest to 24 on a server my friend was supposed to join me on, only to never see that friend logon. Hopped onto a different server and my friend who was already 60 who suggested I go lock for a sweet shadow priest (him) combo for PvP. Got the lock to 22 in a week and last night I realized I really missed playing as priest. Level 6 now on the priest, just gonna go with the flow. My last heartache is that it’s on Alliance, but that part I can live with.
---
They were way too content to make everything 1.12 even though that patch was so late in the game's life and "fixed" a lot of things that people remember fondly about wow.
---
The auction house is used to make money! If I see something "mispriced" I absolutely buy it and repost. Not being malicious just capitalistic! Need 100g at 40 like everybody else
---
Could I bum like 10 gold off of someone?   😂
---
So, every guide notes that leveling as a warrior is the slowest, with the counter that at 60, they come into their own...
---
that being said, there are a few notes that could help...
---
Cooking buffs are important for the stam/spirit, as an alc you should always be running Troll's Blood, which with good spirit gear keeps you topped off at all times...
---
Finally, you need to increase your DPS output  so that your TTK (time to kill) goes down. a high DPS 2hander is the first thing. The your rotation if leveling as ARMs is pretty simple.
---
Charge, Rend, battle shout, hamstring (for overpower procs), then Sunders as required. (Sunders reduce the Mob armor causing your white damage to ramp up quickly). Keep Hamstring up to stop the pesky Mob from running away, and always keep Rend ticking.
---
If you have lots of rage you can include Demo Shout, and more Sunders..
---
Save your Retaliation for accidental over pulls.
---
Heroic Strike is almost never worth it since it has a rage cost AND interrupts your rage generation. At 30 you will use Slam as the rage burning skill.
---
Every few levels take a peek in the AH to see what random 2 handers cost, I have snapped up various low cost Hammer then a sword only focusing on the DPS number.. Funny enough spirit is actually really important for leveling for Warriors, much more than agility or strength.
---
I hope this helps
---
Wait hunters can melee again in retail?
---
There a times where AoE is used - Packs that come with a lot of non-elite mobs, large packs where the warrior has had time to build aggro, raids when you have multiple tanks or know you can burn the pack down before hits anyone. It's not intended to be used every time you fight more than one monster.
---
I played private servers and I had no issues with this because it wasn't as public. Mage aoe runs were streamed to like 4 million people but streaming private servers on twitch wasn't really a thing.
---
I want my satisfaction.
---
Gold!

Hi, /u/RoguegodX

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2z7ih/a_bit_old_but_my_first_stocks_run_with_my_day_1/). 
---
Kinda yeah but way more fluid and more lightning base. Like they had a spell that looked like emperor palpatines force lightning it was a cone aoe attack.
---
Hmmm just got into tanaris last night at lvl 42. Pretty cool to know the quest is doable.
---
Server first lvl 85 warrior in cataclysm was my longest stretch, 30ish hours IIRC.  Had a few 30 minute breaks in there to go for a walk, just to stretch out.  
---
Was brutal, would not recommend.
---
You're not. If you're pulling that many mobs you are kiting, not tanking. If you want to tank mobs dont pull more than you can hold.
---
That's now.
---
I feel like that's more on you than the game. Wow has (almost) always knocked it out of the park, visually, musically, and atmospherically
---
Im assuming your Aki? because Im guessing it gave "Aki" the item because of alphabetical order of names
---
They just need to remaster the old cods HOW THEY WERE WITH NO LOOT BOXES and I think greedy ass activision can pull it off.
---
I think so, it has decent stats. Also, it has an activate to get +30 rage (1 hr cooldown).
---
This means at lvl 60 it still has some use, if you want to hotswap before a raid boss for example.
---
Game was amazing before the combat/class rework.
---
You or him has pvo turned off in friendly to you or him zone...
---
Well that would certainly explain why I wasn't having this problem before. I knew they'd changed layer hopping but not the number of layers available.
---
I have a bag dedicated to stuff I use on the regular. Hearth, profession items (in my case a skinning knife and a rod + lures) health and mana pots, food + water and some  fun stuff I want to keep with me in case I need it. Thats already 8 slots not mentioning the "fun stuff"
---
You know, it’s kind of funny you say that about feeling the need to be an ass because I do the same exact thing whenever I make a troll haha
---
Can gank what you can stun lock for up to 26.5 seconds.
---
on a normal server or rpserver you can duel. even on a pvp server (outside of contested zones, not flagged for pvp).
---
I mean, I wouldn’t be mad if someone bought them to DE.  I guess it’s silly of me to think that everyone shares my idea of what is decent and indecent.  Good points.
---
Haha yeah when the world is new, running around everywhere seems normal cuz you're taking all the things in. I guess and it's probably a little more cumbersome when you're coming back. Glad to hear you're enjoying it though! I'm also looking forward to those flashback moments, remembering what it was like to encounter certain content. It's honestly been so long I feel like it's a first experience about to happen all over again. Are you looking for in game friends? I'm on the lookout for some buddies this go around.
---
The transition from WoD to Legion made classes the most similar in playstyles that they've been since I've started raiding in this game, with BfA making it worse.
---
Which is ironic, given that MoP was "too homogenized" and "everyone could do the same thing" and their supposed goal was the go away from that, and now everyone feels more similar than they did prior.
---
What is it that modern game production companies (I almost said developers, but I have a feeling they knew this already) not understand about this desire?
---
are you in every group ive ever been in?
---
i'll do what the fuck i want
---
That'll make for such a great t- 
---
oh wait
---
How does someone find a bug like this? It's threat. You can't see it or feel it. There's no indication that it's giving too much or giving too little.
---
I’m playing on a MacBook Air. I get to have the classic graphic experience whether I like it or not.
---
If a mage created a portal for you and you paid, then stood there and stared until the portal goes away. Would you expect the mage to make another portal for free?
---
You buy the reagent not the service. His friend wasnt paying attention and missed the summon.
---
I like lack of honor or any real incentive to PvP is what’s killing PvP.  I actually make it a point to kill most alliance I see, but if I don’t initiate a fight it seems rare that anything breaks out.  I was actually grouping for a quest with another horde player and we came across an alliance lock about to die... and he actually went and helped him out.  I made a comment about how he’s way nicer than I am and his response was ‘meh.. pvp’s not turned on yet’.  
---
A bit puzzling to me, but seems to be a lot of people’s mentality.  I’m actually extremely excited for phase 2 as I can totally see groups of 5 rolling around and getting into skirmishes with other groups.  Hoping it’ll turn into a mini DAoC style PvP battle until BG’s release.
---
Doubt it
---
How are you sure its layering thats causing this? Theres a lot of other factors like faction balance, if your ahead of the curve, and times your playing / the zone your playing in.
---
Layering doesnt have some special aspect of it that reduces the amount of opposing faction thats on that layer, it should be completely random and the ratio of alliance to horde should maintain the same as if there were no layers, and the total population on one layer would still be high, thats why there are layers in the first place.
---
Definitely recommend help if you're not a class that can take on 4-5 mobs at a time. It's very likely you aggro a mob where it spawns 3 scorpids. Should be pretty easy to find someone though
---
But that's kinda the point
---
Picking horde on a high horde pop server should have the disadvantage of not reliably being able to find a battleground alliance group to fight against
---
It's an AoAoE
---
Dracarys is the one that I use.
---
Ah I see, we were in Ratchet so I guess my PvP was not turned on thanks :)
---
have to keep spells limited for future mobile and console ports
---
Thought I was in /r/MagicTCG for a second lol
---
You dodged a bullet :)
---
You forgot “I’m an alliance and this horde helped me kill a mob once”
---
They are more viable dps than feral druid and people seem to think feral is viable
---
but the cash didn't go to blizzard. that's the difference.
---
So as someone who has only ever played Vanilla and now Classic. Are there less? More?
---
You really need to calm down
---
SM library would drop some for me. Other than that lvl 33 is the lowest I've seen humanoids drop mage weave
---
Power trip lol
---
Tbh blizzard never knew what the hell they are doing with demo locks and cat druids
---
I miss all the spells I used to have as a ret pala. So much utility.
---
Addon letmecast
---
Are you talking like... at 60 or ... What?
---
Also, do you have unlimited Gold? Because if you're talking about as you level up having BiS then you will need unlimited Gold.
---
And the cunts that advertise watch my stream in dungeons is annoying af
---
AHDB works, pretty fast too.
---
Warriors&gt;all
---
Yeah, my lock experience was shaded from doing a bunch of BGs.
---
Needed a full bag of shards for max shenanigans.
---
Let people enjoy the game how they want to enjoy the game
---
I wish it was more like this when I was questing in Hillsbrad... It's always just a high level or two wrecking a bunch of 20somethings...
---
Wouldn't be Classic without power tripping guild masters.
---
Legit though, that sucks. Hope you can find another guild who's owner doesn't treat their members like garbage.
---
Is this from a random private server to promote in chat? Zul Gurub Raptors in background
---
Just hit 35 and gone to STV. How far should it take me before I have to zone hop again?
---
More like sunset at booty bae
---
Definitely Titan panel.  Been using it since Vanilla
---
Similar but tempest warrior only used lightning and not other elements. It is also unique as the other specs for the class itself were all melee. Here is a description of all of the spells they had. https://rift.magelo.com/en/abilities/57/Tempest
---
Run and never look back lol
---
People like that have no power in their real life so go nuts on the little amount they get in games
---
the tauren head, nice
---
Highest mage in a guild, real big shot fellas.
---
This is true
---
Retail is a hamster wheel of daily grinds and ubfifilling hoa grindiing. With a loot wheel which provides you with unrewarding titanforges and socketed gear
---
are you in the US or another country?
---
I’m on vacation but there is no rest for the wicked, so sit back and enjoy the end of summer with some poolside WoW Classic chatter.
---
The show sneaks in a topical fiscal discussion regarding fresh economies and what’s happening across many servers worldwide right now, while also briefly touching on the recent blue post regarding layering abuse and the gathering of mats.
---
After that, we hear all about the evolution of raids through WoW’s life cycle (and what vanilla had to offer), and balancing WoW with a minor league baseball career.
---
Finally, the show brings it on home with a fascinating chat with former Star Wars: The Old Republic lead designer, Damion Schubert, about the making of what was another huge MMORPG, and the design philosophies that went into that game while competing with WoW, as Countdown to continues to highlight the design process of the games that have helped forge the genre over the years.

Also, yes I'm aware how silly it seems talking SWTOR on the WoW Classic podcast but the show touches on other MMO's occasionally too and weaves in WoW chat amongst it! If no interest then the time stamps are there for you :)

Cheers,

---
This is how I enjoy the game though :)
---
Yeah, it's called survival
---
i meant closer, ty tho
---
Cause blizzard has no thought process when it comes to these types of decisions.
---
No thanks
---
I'm leveling as shadow priest, and recently ran ZF at level 44 as healer with a druid tank, I think level 45. Almost every pull I had to spam Greater Heal to keep him alive, and if anything extra got pulled, we would barely scrape by. The warrior dps had a mob on him almost every pull as well. This run was a nightmare and not fun at all to heal, and we didn't finish it due to wiping by pulling too many beetles. 
---
To people who say they heal to 60 without issues specced Shadow? HOW!? I'm scared to even attempt to heal anything ZF and up until respecing out of shadow after that run.
