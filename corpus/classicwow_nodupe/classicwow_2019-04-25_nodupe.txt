Tues/Weds, 7:30-11 pm CST. Thurs will be 20 mans/progression for later tiers
---
\*\*Raid Philosophy/Info\*\*
---
\-Each player will be expected to play correctly, to their fullest, and bring proper consumes. Those who arent prepared, are lazy or make the same mistakes over and over, are not welcome and will be replaced at any time.
---
\-We will allow for the possiblity of 1 of each meme spec (ret/feral/shadow, etc), as long as they CARRY their weight, both in terms of dps and playing to the maximum of their utility.
---
\-Raiders will be held accountable for attendance, performance, and attitude; with a hardcore-guild level of skill requirement. However, we will not be competing for records, realm firsts, or driving past the planned 2/3 nights a week of raids to down content, as there is no reason to burnout. The goal is to play steadily and kill bosses cleanly and have a good time.
---
\-Loot Council will be the method of distribution. The council will consist of all of the class leaders, who will also form the officer core. The factors that will go into decisions will be as follows: attendance, performance, preperation, and willingness to contribute out of raids. The last includes: consumes, gearing of newer RAIDERS and participation in guild activities outside of raiding. Loot will be distributed in the manner to most efficiently benefit the guild.
---
\*\*Who Should Join\*\*
---
\-Potential Officers/Class Leads (Must have experience and character), Raid Core (People with experience but not interested in leadership) and social/noobs. All will be welcome, but if you want a raid spot, you will be expected to learn to perform up to standards through the leveling process. Class Leads will be there to help.

But mafia is bannable on live servers
---
This. But let's say nothing is lost.  
---
Go play War 3 together, and especially the Orc bonus campain.  
---
That's where the Horde grew up in me above all and really tied my to the Warcraft' story.

There is no difference in difficulty. Just how fast you can get through it push and be the best. No one cares of MC gear when AQ’s out. They are pushing for first and being better don’t play in a hardcore guild like that.
---
No details as of yet, but I would assume so.
---
The worst thing about lock is the time to reset after a death. Mage can get back into action almost instantly. While the lock needs 1-2 minutes at least. (Especially if you sacc your pet trying to survive those damn rogues!)

Where are all the NA-Horde-PvE server guilds at?
---
Anyway, I'm looking to raid. I'm looking for a PvE server, NA, west coast raid times (~6-10 PT). I raided in vanilla (off/main tank). For this time around, I'm still debating between:
---
* Horde, tauren shaman, healer
---
* Alliance, gnome warrior, tank
---
Please PM with more details.
---
I think people need to a breath and maybe go outside.
---
Right there with you.
---
Pretty much just waiting for the date. Then going to confirm which person(s) I will be rolling with for the first week.
---
I guarantee they could still beat all the bosses in there with a ret paladin who's not geared. Vanilla raid bosses are not hard like people make them.
---
Repentance? Instant, 6 second CC in case something gets loose from a real CC.
---
Just because you can get by with suboptimal specs does not mean you should consciously choose to take them.
---
In order for this script to work, I think the addon SuperMacro is needed.
---
Female dwarves are a myth, they don't breed they just pop out of the ground in dun morogh wake up sheeple
---
RemindME! Three Months
---
Lets get it
---
Sure, but thats maybe 1% of the playerbase that are in guilds like that.
---
Indeed, though after an uproar from users. No news on tauren range so I doubt it.
---
(Please no, as a former tauren shaman it just gimped 2 out of 3 specs)
---
I don't play a Warlock, but I'd presume this depends on how long the enemy has to live. Channeled spells block mana regeneration for the entirety of the channel, and Drain Soul doesn't really do any more damage than wanding (probably less if you have a half-decent wand). The more time you spend draining, the more you miss out.
---
It seems to me that the min-max approach would be to just wand and do a r1 Drain Soul right before death.
---
I will give agility or Spell power on weapon on every alt in my guild to become a good boi like him

Cross faction collusion was against the rules in vanilla but I’ve never heard of anyone actually getting banned for it.
---
And then they get on their mount and /wave at you before leaving.

---
If you're using the other faction to harass and harm people on your own faction it is considered griefing even to this day I believe.
---
What are your thoughts/recommendations?
---
I’m looking to level a Warlock and Mage together simultaneously, both UD on a Horde PvP server.
---
My Lock will be my main therefore, they shall have Eng/Ench as their professions, along with all secondary professions, which I’ll focus on levelling once I’m 60!
---
My Mage I was thinking to go with Alch/Tailor? Alch as pots and flasks will become viable In the later stages and Tailor for the obvious their both clothiers.
---
Please let me know your thoughts on how I could maximise! 
---

---
All gear is a luxury by your definition, all gear ever including the rags you spawn into the game wearing are luxuries.
---
Mounts increase your overall gameplay experience by an order of magnitude over any epic item you can acquire while leveling. Trade skills, exp gain overall, travel time, escape ganks, reach mobs before others, ability to do larger aoe pulls. If you got a jordan at 35 and I got a mount at 40 in 3 days I'll be 5 levels over you and the Jordan will have actually been the EPIC reason you lost that fight when encountering me.
---
On TBC it's goot to have one in the melee group, but not necessary. I'd say they started to become really good after LK?
---
How bad is playing shadow priest on the PvE side of things? I do not mind healing at all but I prefer do be DPS specced in the world and I really love shadow priest. Never played it in vanilla but have played it in retail ever since Cata/MoP times.
---
I understand you are only bringing one per raid at most but that is not something I worry about since I already have a solid group that I will raid with.
---
I am leveling with a lock too so I am sure he would love to have a shadow priest on his side. And as I said, I have nothing against healing and quite enjoy it at times but I am not so sure about being a main healer.
---
The disadvantage is what makes it fun
---
Unless you are racing for realm first there is no reason to actively avoid taking them.
---
That's a yikes from me dawg. All yall preparing like classic wow is going to be the same as private servers.
---
Honestly you probably put more effort into that binder than blizzard is putting into classic development.
---
Verigans motherfuckin Fist
---
/startattack is awful for everyone. It's a toggle, which makes it useless.
---
If you combine it with Sinister Strike or Bloodthirt, like this
---
/startattack
---
/cast Bloodthirst
---
If you press once, it will start attacking and cast Bloodthirst. But if you're like me, you're spamming it, and since it's a toggle, it also cause your character to stop attacking as well.
---
&gt;  A good player playing a bad spec is better than a terrible player on any class.
---
I aggree with you, but people seem to think that these are mutually exclusive.
---
But what if your competition are good players with good specs?
---
He has a justified stake in that item, so he's protecting himself by need rolling. He also may just ask to /roll after, but you didn't like his answer so he was just being a dick for not opening himself up to a ninja. This is why you need roll on insane items.
---
I always forget that you can res at the spirit healer with no penalty before level 10. It’s a free hearthstone.
---
tradeskill patterns were different, call it a double standard if it makes you feel better but people respected a skiller and not someone who just got lucky off doing 1/5 the work and wanted to take home the whole haul because he has the ability to soulbind an item.
---
You should note that pretty much all the values in private servers are made up. They are in no way accurate to how retail will be.
---
[removed]
---
Lol. You realize that that would mean blizzard makes $0 from those people’s subs right? With the current wow token blizzard makes $20 for each sub payed for with gold instead of the $15 that they would normally get dum dum
---
RemindME! August 1st, 2019 “This dude is one of us.”
---
Guys just because you can’t understand it. That’s how they wanna play the game and that’s fine. Rey pallies are strong for pvp and for short dungeons and will be used but most guilds will not be taking more then one raid spot I bet that. Just the game guys. If you haven’t played it you wouldn’t understand. If you have then you have forgotten. Play your rest pally but don’t join a serious raiding guild it’s just the way it is. Deal with it and move on. That’s all. Enjoy it for what it is don’t complain because you don’t understand. Or disagree
---
The less gold you make a gold sink, the less effective it is. Making a gold sink cost less gold doesn't eliminate the problem that you're lowering a major gold sink that is necessary for a somewhat healthy economy.
---
Fewer warlocks
---
Not true, enchanters never got to need on greens even though it checks all the same boxes. Nodes required the group to clear to, greens dropped from mobs killed by the group, one skill gets to be greedy with an overly abundant resource while the other has to scrape and save and sacrifice greens which are badly needed for leveling gold/etc.
---
My question is similar to yours, but I've only seen data on private servers. The real question is: Are Ret paladins coded correctly on private servers? Does anyone have data from a vanilla blizzard server?

I figure I should start adding this to every one of these threads. I'm keeping a compiled list of all recruiting guilds in a google sheets so people can add temporary filters to find what they're looking for. Green stuff is what I've verified, not green stuff I have yet to verify (I've verified most guilds).
---

---
Exactly. If I can spend 20 hours or $20 to get my epic mount, i will always spend the money. From a time investment perspective, the money is the obvious choice. I make that in like an hour, vs 20 hours of grinding. Bad farming classes are what fill the ah with fish, food, herbs, and ores and random materials. Why farm all those things when you can just drop $20 and never have to farm in the first place? 
---
I would be totally cool with one way discount  tokens, though. Maybe like 500g a month to half your monthly sub price. Just as a way to get gold out of the economy.
---
Not going to happen.
---
yup, the run i figured out from 1-5 alone involves four suicides and HP juggling to get it down to 33 minutes. I should do it and screenshot it or something
---
Source?
---
And also it’s not only world first. You can tell the difference in guilds and players there is not crazy catch up! You will be able to tell a guild who took a well made and thought out group vs a guild who took five warr/mage dps out and put in ret pallies and balance druids.
---
Every blizzard release ever.
---
&gt; No one cares of MC gear when AQ’s out.
---
Uhm, thats nonsense. This isnt retail. You need to progress through the raids no matter what the latest content is. MC gear will be interesting for people doing BWL. And people will do BWL to get into AQ40. Also gear wasnt as streamlined, a lot of BiS stuff comes from lower tier raids. I am not even starting on Legendaries...
---
So you purposely keep your HP low in order to die on command? Those low level mobs can take a while to kill you unless you pull like 4 at once.
---
I mean if you have no qualms about rogues and warriors rolling on Blackcrow than we fine.
---

---
Please nerf,
---
sincerely - a rouge
---
It depends, less gold could be = more swaps thus spending more gold. I'll be a casual player so swapping specs like i did back in the day is out of the question. It's really hard to say without the game being out, and it will need to build an economy before we can place a judgement. I have a feeling people will go hard for awhile, and at 60 split time between retail and classic. The economy will be different then it was during vanilla.
---
People are **underestimating** this bottleneck, there will be no questing when the vanilla spawn timer on quest bosses were 10 minutes and the Barrens/Westfall have THOUSANDS compared to the 75 or so we experience on the most populated private server. 
---
It's going to be aids, and even with sharding it's going to be aids. We aren't asking for them to make 200 shards for the Barrens/Westfall and it be a solo experience. There will be plenty of people in your shard to compete with for tags or better yet group with. They could take things a step further and have places like Crossroads and Goldshire unsharded so you can see the massive population when you come into town.
---
It's actually closer to no-change Vanilla to have a few shards per server, Vanilla never experienced the million of players all about to start a fresh level 1 account. It would only be temporary. It would prevent people from quitting 100%. 
---
I'm not going to come back here to try to tell people I told you so, the damage will be done when all the casuals get pushed away over what in retrospect was common sense.
---
That second guild sounds like it was created by a man of taste and distinction.
---
A lot of balance changes were put off until 2.0 and lumped in with the pre-bc stuff. Yes it has stuff people don't think of as classic, and mixed in with it are your classic balance changes. The reality is it's an arbitrary choice to not include some balancing talents that were added to make some specs viable; just as arbitrary as digging numbers up for older patches, implementing those, and making even more class/specs unviable.
---
some bad logic, you can argue trade materials spawn randomly and should all be divided equally. sometimes its herbs, other times its cloth. 
---
If investment means entitlement, why did enchanters get shit on when it came to greeded items?
---
Had a rogue try to tell me the items in the locked chest were his, right after we cleared the 4 pack of elites standing right next to it.
---
*Enchants gray bracers with +3 stam*, welp guess I'm not replacing these until my mid 30's.
---
I would imagine professions would play the bigger role in moneymaking, right? I never tried my hand at making money being a portal jockey, so I guess I have no point of reference though.
---
He's right about this, it wasn't sure fire but recipes were given respect in vanilla.
---
One last point, the other option is have a big number of servers and either merge some or let them die. The irony in that is you mine as well just have sharding from the get go and have awesome action packed cities, economies and plenty of world PvP once you get past the 10-20 zones since those would be unsharded.
---
Less locks roll Ally because all Undead players have WotF.
---
I miss Warhoof, the Tauren who enchanted my bracers in Goldshire at level 4. Absolute legend.
---
Correct and a lot of BIS is Mc but a guild drilling in their first raid ony and Mc kills well people are pushing AQ is my point. That will be the gap not that crazy I’m just saying. If that clears that up
---
Can you use the fire reflector here?
---
Depending on the situation ya, you have to know where you die and mana balance in order to actually be low enough at the proper area. The way it works without listing quests is you hearth at iveronn's antidote start when you talk to that dude, then you suicide inside the spider cave, then you suicide inside the spider cave again, then you suicide at the moonwell, AND THEN UR GOOD 2 GO so its actually 3 suicides and 1 hearth to maximize levelling. this is excluding the routing and quest groupups
---
Wow dude, you come off as a super cool dude that I would love to raid with. /s
---
What if cross realms was just better, and filled with locals first. Same server exposure, no more wait. Pretty much the same, but with more community.
---
D;
---
while 19 twinks are the popular thing today, in vanilla the craze on my server was 29.
---
i had a 29 undead priest named Geff on laughing skull, oh the glory days i was nearly invincible!
---
You may be doing something wrong.
---
First off which version of wow are you playing?  In TBC + /startattack turns on auto attack and does not toggle it. 
---
In vanilla/pservers you need a macro like:
---
/script if not IsCurrentAction(24) then UseAction(24) end;
---
Where the #24 is The location on your hotbars where the Auto Attack ability is. You can search on the net for wow hotbar numbers for a picture of it for reference.
---
You're right and sadly I think the community doesn't have the common sense to realize this. I truly believe if it was polled people would say no to sharding in the 10-20 zones without much depth of though. The only other option to handle the million of players on launch is to open up more servers which is ironic because sharding would at least lead to way more world PvP after the 10-20 zone (unsharded at this point), lead to great economy with many niches and just more socialization in cities. 
---
It's one of those "remind me in 6 months" kind of thing where all the people who opposed sharding the 10-20 zones would look back and realize it was short-sighted to do so.
---
I'm missing the joke. Anybody want to save me from this "whoosh"?
---
I said they consider august the entire month as summer still. I wouldn't even be surprised if they changed their minds and decided for a blizzcon midnight launch.
---
I can’t believe I’ve never thought of suiciding in the cave. My dumb ass probably died in there and ran back to my corpse.
---
&lt;Riders of the Horde&gt;  Azgalor US PvP
---
They're really only bought for the warlock buff. Bad scaling, run oom super fast, extra threat, low range, no AoE, poor single target damage, take up precious debuff slots.  
---
  
---
It's fun to be different but yeah, you're just they're for the +15% warlock buff. They aren't good on their own right by any definition.
---
QUADDD DAMAGE
---
Holy fucking warriors batman!
---
&gt;then a hour and 20 minutes to reach 10,
---
beats everyone currently working to optimize 1-10 at [Barrens.Chat](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=904) unless you're a particular Shaman. Care to share the route?
---
And you're getting to 18 at 4.8 hours, and the record there is 7 hours to 20? Okay, I'm calling bullshit now.
---
Except they are just bad. Like, plain bad. I wouldnt blame any raid lead expecting you to play a spec that can do its job. And if I was in a raid that fails due to low damage while having a whole bunch of wonky dps classes that do a fraction of what a good dps would do... yeah, I would ve kinda pissed.   
---
People need to accept that Vanilla raiding was balanced around classes, not speccs. And even that balancing wasnt exactly polished. If you insist on playing a bad spec you are effectively asking to be carried. Many people wont care as long as it works either way. But expecting people to slog through wipes... that sounds like a dick move.
---
...I have questions.
---
Orc, no question. Tauren is worse but ok, troll is meme level for pvp (but really unless you're a 1% premade tryhard it really doesn't make that much difference).
---
I'm interested. Sent a friend request over Discord.
---
Bro, that's overall dps, noone gives a shit that you can AoE on trash. Rogues don't even have AoE and they're still doing as much as him.
---
Also, they're in BWL gear and they cant kill Rag before he submerges? People do it in blue gear. Their dps is garbage, so no wonder that you can even see him on the dps meter...
---
What AB utility?
---
Think of it this way too, though. If people could swap specs for cheaper, more gold would be added to the economy as more people could switch to a farming spec more easily and more easily make up the difference in gold + more. So not only would it take less gold out of the economy but would actually pump more gold into it.
---
I never liked the argument about value, I doubt the culture would have felt that way when it came to dungeon loot even if the vendor prices were higher. I think it's the fact that twink items rapidly lose value as you level and then get vendored for another blue eventually. What a waste when someone could save 10 hours of grinding max level.
---
Totally missed that till I saw your comment.
---
I should just stick to my shadow dreams in PvP then? And hoping for TBC in the future!
---
As I said I have nothing against healing in PvE but want to have the chance to have some juicy damage in PvP. Will probably still priest but thanks for the reply.
---
As a long time wow fan who found the books during cata... this makes a lot of sense
---
Hell yeah man just got my A+ this December and got a job at a hospital and have never been happier. IT is the fuckin way to go &amp; I can take off a week or two for classic launch with no problems :)

"True Fulfillment: Converted by the powers of the Prophet Skeram, the target is converted and filled with divine power. While converted, the target's spells are cast instantly, damage is increased by 300%, all resistances increased by 50 and movement speed is increased by 40%. Lasts 20 sec."
---
So he hit a 4.6k crit. He was wearing a lot of t2 so the lock in the vid isn't even that insanely geared. Expect to see even bigger crits in classic :)
---
Always Tauren or Dwarf. The two greatest races.
---
I could do it sometime today or in a couple days when i feel like it, and screenshot the markers. I don't know anything about speed levelling however this is specifically with teldrassil. My levelling falls apart at level 18 and beyond cause i havn't really optimized any routing
---
Definitely true. My current airline's training dept is decently close to this guy's binder which is nice...
---
Small value items should just go to the class need rolling if its an item they will get significant use from, the vast majority of twink items are the opposite. Unless someone is making a character to stay in that bracket the item gets trashed before it provides its true potential in terms of value.
---
You got some  issues girl and I feel sorry for your bf. This might not be the game for you two to be playing together. Find something else.
---
I'd rather party with someone who has equips on
---
Wrong, don't be jealous of the light.
---
Yeah, like I said though its all speculation and really hard to say if it truly would hurt the economy or not until the game is released and has a large number of max level players. Theres a good and a bad for dual spec and I think everyone can agree on that.
---
There's more to the game than raiding. Druids are top tier at world pvp and are the best fc in bgs. They can also play multiple roles. Imo vanilla is the most balanced wow has ever been. The issue is that when most people talking about balance, they only talk in terms of raiding. You need to factor everything in. Raiding, world pvp, bgs, 1v1s, farming, leveling ease/speed, etc.
---
You can also suicide in the moonwell where you have to do the fill quest, cause the graveyard is right at the ramp, and when you talk and jump down you take like 50-60% fall damage if you do it properly. Which allows you to juggle mobs hitting you on the way to the moonwell to die immediately after filling
---
Warlock or Mage, I like casters but can’t decide which. Benefits of picking one over the other or anything to help me decide is appreciated
---
Mage vs rogue is a pretty fun and close matchup but it's generally considered mage favoured. Rogue will need some pro spell batching/engi/luck to win if the mage plays it perfectly.
---
You can kill bosses in MC with 20 people, doesn't mean anything.
---
If you want to be stuck in MC for nearly 2 hours while in wearing BWL gear, then more power to you.
---
I'd rather clear it in 40 minutes in go back to PvPing or doing something else.
---
Actually on this fight the MC gives you instant cast so nothing but CC or silence would have stopped this
---
I'm a hordie too and I also love Duskwood.  Such a cool vibe in that zone.  It's Halloween all year long!

It's usually not at the top of people's lists but you can find groups for it I think.  But with the huge influx of people when Classic launches, people are going to want to run EVERYTHING.   Vanilla SFK is also a treasure lost to time, so that's going to incentivize people even more.  I predict lots of Alliance groups braving the dangers of Horde territory to run SFK and SM a ton, especially at launch.  You'll be all set!
---
You dump him and get a boyfriend on the horde side.
---
Jk jk! I played Alliance for several years and eventually curiosity and lack of people on my server (before mergers) led me there. I thought Orgrimmar was ugly too. 
---
Now having a horde-only husband keeps me here lol.
---
The mind control gives you a buff you gain 300% damage done and all your spells are instant cast :)
---
That may just increase the likelihood of dead servers. If they spin up a bunch of extra servers to meet day 1 demand and then all the tourists bail after 2 weeks, there will be a lot of low servers.
---
You posted the wrong link by accident. Post the one with the good numbers.

LFG US East Alliance. Human Warrior. PvX. Pref raid times on Fri/Sat, but open to weekdays if it's not too late EST. Played in vanilla/bc, but just messed around and didn't raid until wrath. Wife tends to play on RP servers, so we'll probably end up there.  
---
Also open to starting up a small guild with the right people. Ran a couple of guilds in the past, and it can be a lot of fun to have a regular group in voice chat.
---
Let me know if either of those sound good. Snow#5979

"I promise to equip this item in 4 levels when i can use it"
---
You going to psychotically follow someone's leveling to see if they equip that item when they said they would? Just an example that throws a wrench in this principle.
---
Nodody knows.
---
Classic will be based on the retail client, so it might be possible to unlock it the same way it is possible on the current retail client.     
---
From what we’ve seen from the demo and the recent data mining of the beta client, Blizzard removed quite a few things that don’t belong in Classic, but since the action cam would really only affect the player using it, I guess there is a small chance it stays accessible in one form or another.
---
Personally I'm indifferent to it either way since it wouldn't affect my Classic experience one bit if some people decided they wanted a more action oriented camera style.
---
&lt;Scourge of the Shadows&gt; US-Firetree.  Nothing like being in a Kiwi guild on a US server. They would be raiding at like 11am their time.  Most fun I've ever had in wow.  And then we all used to do AV together when one of our hunters was getting close to his rank 14. great times
---
It isn't really speculation. There would be no reason why people wouldn't farm more if it were cheaper to switch and it isn't speculation that gold farming methods have become improved and more widespread than before. Unless you can make an argument on how lowering respec cost would mean less gold being farmed, I think it's pretty clear what would happen.
---
"We'll talk to him"
---
-the last thing you ever hear
---
It was unexpected. They are hardcore PoE veterans, too. But I suppose battle and grinding felt too weak for them.
---
it isnt "thats life" when you roll need, that avoids this false defeatist mentality.

Like I said, there's a very large gap between "racing for realm first" and "taking ret paladins".
---
When you take a ret paladin you are making a conscious decision to take a DPS that is going to do half the damage of a warrior/rogue/mage/warlock. You are consciously choosing to slow your raid down by that much, all so that one person can feel special playing a meme DPS spec.
---
If it was a Shadow Priest or a Feral Druid, they could at least bring something useful to the raid, but Ret Paladin brings nothing special that a Holy Paladin can't.
---
And all the threat of the ignite goes to one mage. At least with a few high dps warriors the threat is spread among each according to their individual damage
---
Remember seeing that one too. Might be that the mods removed it.
---

And just like in my youth, I will blow off my scholastic responsibilities to play WoW. We have come full circle.
---
Oh it was real funny that's why i want it
---
This is technically correct. Dal'Rend's set will be pre-raid BiS in phase 1 in terms of pure damage output.
---
However, in order to use the preferred raiding spec 20/31/0 you will probably have to use the Warmonger as your melee weapon in order to be hit capped, at least until you manage to get your hands on a 3% hit scope.
---
Practically speaking though, getting both Dal'Rend's over masses of rogues and warriors that will also want them may be a bit of a challenge and unfair to them. May as well wait for P2 when Barbarous Blade becomes available and use something like the Peacemaker in the meantime.
---
Did you just assume your sexuality?

This was the nerdiest death threat I have ever read. I could hear braces and speech impediments when I read the part about not grouping with you being a fate worse than life without fedoras.
---
(jk about personal attacks but the rest was true)
---
Exactly! Thx
---
You can keep exaggerating all you want my guy, doesn't mean anything. It won't take that long and i don't get why you continue to post here. if you don't want a ret paladin, then why waste your time here. Go join some sweaty guild.
---
Im looking forward to you setting world records.
---
It’s like you people are just trying to drive me insane by constantly posting all these shitty memes
---
while some of my RL friends played alliance on Akama and i had a lvl 50 ish alt there,   Onslaught was a raiding guild on Lightning's Blade alliance side.
---
No.
---
Warlock:  easier leveling, more utility in groups, gets to summon badass demons.
---
Mage:  higher end game DPS than warlocks, will constantly be harassed by people begging for water, cannot summon badass demons.
---
Pretty sure Tauren racial also includes gear in vanilla and is changed to base hp in a later expansion
---
Yep it's exactly that post i did not tought of google for this haha thx man
---
It'll be released when everyone's back to school like always.
---
It's a solid idea but I would group Oceania with NA since thats how they are grouped by Blizzard for the servers.
---
Why did you delete your link showing poor ret paladin dps then tell me to "stay jealous"? I don't care what people I won't be raiding with spec tbh I'm just saying your statement was false.
---
it's absolutely speculation "the forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence." There's no firm evidence you have that is current because the game is not live, there's noone actively doing it as we speak. Am i saying you're 100% wrong no not at all, I am providing a point why dual spec could still work, and even provided ideas on how to still provide some sort of gold sink for the economy.  You don't have to agree with it, I am 100% for dual spec for the reason of me wanting to tank and play as a dps for pvp, as a casual player I don't want to grind 2 characters of the same class to do 2 different roles, especially because I plan on my alt to be a healer.
---
Re-release the Bill Shatner one.

"intended for my class" Youre in for a rude awakening when a feral druid says staff of jordan is just the thing he needs to heal up and keep mana regen going between pulls.
---
I literally had a guy insulting me over the ring from DEADMINES. I had to threaten to kick him....... because it was a free run i was providing as a 60. He was a hunter and thought 2 agility and 6 int made this the perfect hunter ring, that's a piss poor ring for a hunter compared to a mage but technically he can't find much better for a while. 8 stats on 1 ring Who wins here? realize that commiting to either side can have negative consequences.
---
Night King = Lich King! Mind is blown.
---
Thank you for this dude!

Calm down it's obvious sarcasm. This thread is just vanilla heads violently withdrawing.

Perfect, Just what i was looking for. Thanks.

Maybe. I didn't know about it until a week ago.

With that garbage dps, there's nothing to be jealous about.

You have to give him a ten dollar bill and a five dollar bill

Or three five dollar bills

---
What is confusing to me is why you didnt just put all of this in a PDF. How many trees did you kill to make this?
---
Why is mage better PvP than Hunter?
---
I dont mind buying or paying for it. But why is it a monthly subscription...before I can even use it?
---
All versions (except BfA) are currently free with monthly subscription.
---
BOB
---
What is an action camera?
---
But won’t you have to have a subscription to play classic?
---
At least you won't be rolling need on something you don't need.
---
They will put out some marketing for it, but in no way will it resemble the marketing of traditional past expansions.
---
I think you can just give him a physical time card from Gamestop or something. 
---
Classic only requires a subscription to play, so if you gift him game time, he may be able to just download it and play.
---
what a great point, I bet the culture completely switched to "all greed is the new way to ensure resale" meaning now you were forced to make room for ninja looters fucking you over.
---
Tauren for lyfe
---
you just need a sub, that's it. you wont need any current expansion or anything, just a sub.
---
29 twink is where it's at. Getting a boost for those STV beast mastery quests to get the crazy OP chest gear,, grinding the Arena for the Arena Master trinket. Man I loved wow back then
---
Yeah there is some kind of other solution. I think in the end though, minimal sharding is the cleanest. But still, I pray that it’s just 1-5, hope for 1-10, and might just wait a week if it’s 1-20.
---
Sure bud
---
double down on this and start leveling alts when your main is 55+
---
I was forcefully exhaling air from my nose until I read the 'hasn't logged on in 10 years' part. :'(
---
They kill rag at 1 hour 50 min mark, how am i exaggerating?
---
Again, if you're cool with that, more power to you.
---
Just don't go around claiming that ret's dps is anywhere near as good as rogue or warrior.
---
Very minor ones, yes. Such as a few extra damage to boomkin etc. 
---
#unpopularopinion
---
I understand now, thank you!
---
Oh god the truth hurts.
---
Makes sense. Thank you!
---
The random ghost warrior standing outside of the entrance to Blasted Lands.
---
Yes. $15/mo
---
When did i ever once state that Ret is as good as warrior/rogue.
---
I really hope it’s just 1-10. 1-20 is just too much of the game for me to be happy, but 1-10 is a fair concession for Vanilla fans imo. It’s a stretch to say sharding is more Vanilla like though. Didn’t they have to open up new servers soon after launch, because there was way too many people, even on day 1?
---
Big if true. Can anyone verify?
---
People joke about hunters but the number of rogues and warriors after ranged weapons just for the stats...
---
Except fresh on private servers means the same thing we’ve seen before. This time, it’s actually a fresh experience. Was that word the only thing you got from my post? &lt;.&lt;
---
Hunter to me is more enjoyable but rogue is a better class.
---
Got it thank you!
---
I want to read that
---
Horde because alliance is lame.

keys &amp; attunements
---
A very good shadow priest will do average dps in a raid, they bring extra beyond the dps with buffs. You can get a raid spot and be okay, just be prepared to try hard and prove yourself
---
The thing is this launch is expected to have quadruple what the original launch had and sadly it's going to decline a bit, it's not going to be for everyone who tries it. Temporary sharding won't ruin your experience, there will be plenty of people in the 10-20 zone if they implement there and they should. 
---
Vanilla has never experienced anything near what it's about to.
---
Min/max isn't really a yes no type or thing, scale of 1-5 would make more sense.
---
Can´t you make a raid to avoid xp gain?
---
ROFL, If I had a silver or gold tag this comment would get it.
---
Maybe before 1.12??? I can't find any website stating it had a cd
---
Lvl 20 in 20h on a warrior.
---
I've finished dungeons with a VW when the tank has left. It's certainly possible, but you need to be coordinated and communicate to you group how to manage pulls. It's certainly challenging
---
This backstabbed me right in the feels.
---
Oooh... it's been over a decade. They sent us back in late August.
---
Being a portal jockey is not what makes you money, the ability to AOE grind mobs, and potentially solo huge dungeon packs is what does. Take tailoring and maybe enchanting or herbalism too
---
A special action oriented camera option for retail WoW that – as far as I know – never officially made it into the game, but is accessible through some command lines or add-ons or something like that.
---
[Here’s a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC2nzmN1M-4) that shows how it looks. It was quite popular among content creators for a short while.
---
find it really hard to believe any class was pulling the dps in actual vanilla that is shown in those charts.
---
there is a video still out there of a warrior doing like 1500dps on patchwerk, and it was a big deal at the time.
---
Similar to just below, but mostly torn between lock and mage. 
---
Mained a dwarf spriest almost exclusively in vanilla through Cata and then on and off again (mostly off) since. Played a lot, but was super casual, only doing a few raids here and there. Loved that guy, feel strongly attached to shadow priest, but think I want to try something a little more viable. Although, it’s gonna kill me a bit inside at first. 
---
I had a ~35 ish lock alt back in the day that I liked, and boosted a mage when that was an option. I was sort of overwhelmed after the boost and never really figured it out. 
---
Knowing that I enjoyed playing shadow priest, which would you recommend? 
---
Also, sort of wanting to try a melee alt. As I stay casual, looking for DPS. Warrior, rogue, pally?
---
(Seriously trying to make this choice is paralyzing. I remember picking my priest in 05 solely based off of how the class sounded. If only it were still that easy at a time in my life where I have less time to re-roll if I hate it.)
---

good point thank you
---
That last note is 👌
---
Dinosaur Chicken Tenderloins are all the rage in Orgrimmar these days, though!
---
ahhh i never even thought of that as a possibility, I knew mages are great at aoe trash farming though. I was planning on playing a mage on release so I'll have to try it
---
Watching low levels go nuts when you give them beastslayer was always fun. Everyone loves a glow lol
---
Yeah I dont like the orc look either which is why I’m going to be a fem orc. I’ll probably be model changing if possible.
---
Definitely post your findings after it’s all done please.
---
Wonder how this will be on launch with competition for tags.

I do all of those things.
---
I'll be back in Classic, no worries! :-)
---
I miss you!!!!!!!
---
Brd you can do mining as a rogue to smelt dark iron, any type of blacksmithing use the dark anvil, enchanting for formulas like firey you can farm and sell + disenchanting.
---
Hard to go wrong, really.
---
My wife convinced me to switch from Alliance to Horde and now I’m more excited for classic. So yeah, fuck the Alliance. But in all honesty, it sounds like there are more concerns than faction choice. Classic is all about leveling and grinding...
---
Don't the early ones only sell whites?
---
Horde: Variety of cool and interesting races to pick from
---
Alliance: Human, small human, smaller human, purple human

Well there goes my night, thanks!

Oh man, my first enchant was beastslaying on my sword. It actually helped me beat Princess in Lakeshire :D

My point was that I *have* theorycrafted the shit out of this.

Unless you have something concrete besides "nope" to add to the conversation, I'm just going to assume you're writing checks you can't cash.
---
Countdown to classic has a guild
---
If you PvP the epic mount is not a luxury. Not everyone plays the game for pve
---
Not worth worrying about. Buy the best white weapon for your level when you get to kharanos and include quests that reward good weapons in your route.
---
Terrible advice.
---
That's a pretty tricky question considering we have no idea what or where the Classic servers will be.
---
Tier 2 - some of them
---
Tier 3 - All of them.
---
Horde. Undead males best spellcasting graphics
---
Don't forget the double 15 agi enchants.
---
Most starting zones have a quest near the end that offers a green weapon. Dont overlook staves as an option, offering 10s in chat is defiently a good option to macro and press every few minutes. Tbh dont overlook a white or grey weapon with higher dps, the +1 or +2 strength on a green isn't worth much in comparison to flat damage, therefore the vendor weapons are viable
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/an6JnSz.jpg) is from the private servers, it should be accurate... Respawns should be 2ish hours if I am not mistaken
---
What do you not like about the argument about value? It's logical. "That's the way we've always done it" doesn't mean it's right, that's an appeal to tradition logical fallacy. 
---
Your argument of "why equip a twink item for 5 levels when you could sell it for a lot of gold" is an argument in my favor.
---
I really wish to find a server that the prime time will be aligned with my region

Yea? Ya’ll gonna take 2 ret paladins and 2 Moonkins?
---
You said it yourself, look out for somebody in chat who might get one and also advertise you're buying.
---
In Vanilla, I always rolled need on items that were an upgrade (including BoE) and greed on everything else. 
---
If a BoE epic dropped that was an upgrade for someone, our group made sure that he/she equipped it on that spot so they wont go to the AH to sell it for gold. 
---
I don’t understand this “roll need “ on everything mentality and quite frankly I dont think I will be pugging for this very reason if people today think like that.
---
Never alliance!!
---
&gt; All i'm saying is look into Esfand and Dakova, they have proven that Ret Dps isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be
---
&gt; Did you even bother to watch the video? He was topping the meters the entire time. he didn't get carried, he was the carry.
---
He's been top meters in MC as well, just goes to show you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Topping "overall damage" meters in a casual guild does not prove anything
---
Yes... people only care what you look like in retail because there is transmogrification. If I knew you were literally making yourself worse at the game instead of taking an upgrade because you are too afraid of what others (don't) think about your appearance in a \*15-year-old video game\*, you'd have no spot in my group, no matter what. Maybe on RP servers, but good fucking luck on any regular server. Fuck out of my PvP group if you are intentionally gimping yourself for the "aesthetic" and "immersion." My god.
---
“15 singles like my ex”

---
I’m sorry I’ll google what are acceptable questions for Reddit
---
Again, that is not me ever comparing Ret to a warrior or rogue and saying they're better. Way to put words in my mouth.
---
Yes that pathing but spawns are wayyyyy faster
---
Ok. Show us the math. You can't because you're bullshitting
---
Can we be study buddies? Trying to find a link to the wonderful rogue goodness you have amassed in that nice binder
---
One of the major reasons why Enchanters hang around Goldshire enchanting stuff for free is that the Expert Enchanting trainer is located in the Tower of Azora, which is in the same zone. So they go there to learn new recipes and then hang around in Goldshire to increase their rank, or visa versa.
---
I'm sorry I upset you, I'm trying to explain to you what's helpful and what's not but I think I just ended up insulting you. Sorry.
---
Highly likely the Sydney Australia server will be up. I’m in Osaka Japan and find the Aus retail servers to be the best. However, the modern game does phasing to different realms sometimes. So if I’m solo I’ll be in the Sydney server with 80-100 ping but if I group up with someone and they’re from USA I’ll be dragged to there servers and enjoy 250-300 ping. 
---
Phasing will most likely not be in Classic so I’m not sure if that just means if I choose the Sydney Aus server I’ll never be moved around or off it which would be very nice. A great option for other SEA countries imo.
---
Holy god buying all the mats to level Engineering will be insane. **INSANE**
---
Probably level with a gathering profession or two Mining/Skinning would make sense. The leather will be used in both the engineering and the tailoring. The ore and stone will be used in the Engineering.
---
And by the time you get both mining and skinning to 300, you'll probably have about half the mats you'll actually need to max out your engineering. (maybe less I'm not sure)
---
But you should probably also have some alts named ```BenzilLeather``` and ```BenzillStoneBits``` that you just mail 100% of your farmed mats to. 
---
Also once you start leveling Engineering you can start dusting things that you've made (tailoring too) and use that stuff to level your enchanting. 
---
--------
---
For example, I'm planning on leveling as a Druid tank, and as the GM of my guild, with a bunch of RL friends in my guild. I'm going to level enchanting for that druid tank trinket, and I'm gonna have the guild funneling me mats so I can level my enchanting faster. But a lot of the guild will be leveling with gathering professions only. And we'll have a few select people that are going to level primary professions and feed gear back into the guild.

for sure. but that's what makes healing fun. you have other support spells to use and other things to do outside of just raw casting heals the whole time
---
Even the ones in your own faction. They can't be trusted either.
---
You can always determine who the best real life human beings in your guild are because they quit years ago.
---
It's once the spell finishes casting.  If the projectile has already left the player's hand you're out of luck.  The game basically does a "check" when the cast is done and if there is unbroken LOS from the player to you then it is successful.
---
Kevin Jordan brings up an excellent point about warlocks in 1.12 and the shadowbolt spam. It's not due to debuff slots the problem lies in the dot scaling. If you check the tbc patch notes they buffed the scaling on all dots in the game by ~30% across the board to try and fix the issue and it wasn't enough in some cases. 16 debuff slots is only an earlygame buff once you get to AQ/naxx gear dots become less efficient than just casting shadowbolt. I don't expect the private server meta to change much.
---
Plenty of those stumpy things in the middle do break LOS but yes not all.
---
I've been considering doing something like this for a while now... but now I feel like it's something I have to do.
---
You can already do that.  I did that for months.
---
and thats exactly my point, it works just not all the time.  and that ok
---
I have a weird vanilla memory. I'll forget super common boss names that I killed a million times, but then I'll remember entire drop tables for others.

You aren't re-opening an even discussion here you are just using the post platform to share your personal opinion. You also did so using conjecture and presenting opinions as if they are facts.
---
Needing on a BoE item to sell it is not the "definition of ninja looting" you're just making shit up to support your argument.
---
BoP items can only be acquired in their specific drop location while BoE items can be acquired from the AH at any time. 
---
Saying that because a Mage can use Staff of Jordan because they can use it is just ignorant. A smart mage wouldn't waste so much gold on an item they will replace before raiding and by letting them take it you just take away the equal opportunity of the group to benefit. You also enable a player to make a bad decision instead of educating them on what would be more beneficial to their character during a time where gold is so scarce.
---
Undead females used to do flips randomly. Do you know how awesome it is to be a rogue and flipping around your opponent?!
---
Um what?
---
There isn't really a playstyle that comes close to matching spriest in cata cause it's so different. Lock is closer than a mage for sure, but still pretty distant. Both have good damage and good utility, with mage having more damage and lock having more utility. If you're really struggling to pick, just go back to whichever you like more thematically. They're both great in both pve and pvp

Listen. No changes. I want routine server crashes. I want extended maintenance. I was glitches, bugs, Bush Jr in the oval office, and a troop surge in Iraq okay? I want my authentic vanilla experience
---
Huh... was prepared to hate it, but I kind of like it.  Not even sure I’d use it, but it’d definitely be a cool option.
---
The only thing stopping you is respec costs. Which can be overcome.
---
Damn, I get hard for keybinds that sound good. I’m playing combat rogue but the thought of these shapeshift keybinds sounds fun.
---
Serious question:
---
Ignoring raid viability; what makes a Ret Paladin fun? From what I understand they are 80% auto attack AFK damage.
---
I'm looking for a such a site, but with more text and less video content.
---
Don't get me wrong, sometimes videos are helpful, but the time spent watching could be spent playing. So this is good for killing some time until classic, but not very practical once Classic hits.
---
Though I understand that video content is easier to monetize (a blessing and a curse?).
---
Good post

Sorry

If you're more casual and don't plan on doing any type of deeper end game content, go with a hunter. But if you really want to see all of the end game content and go deep in raiding, go with a rogue. In deeper end game, groups will take between 5-8 rogues but usually only 2 hunters. 
---
They're both great in PvP.
---
Druids were a...uuuhhhmmm varied in vanilla...
---
LazerChkn = Meh for the most part.
---
Cat = Poor mans rogue, pretty versatile in a pinch
---
Bear = Solid main tank through all of the 5/10 man content, and solid offtanks in endgame content (with gear)
---
Healer = Arguably best RAID healer for healing ```not the tanks``` and more than enough heals for any 5/10 man content. (Could probably solo heal a 10 man, with gear, and a solid group... I would bring another healer ```in case shit```)
---
But my roommate during vanilla played a resto druid, and I played a resto shaman, and we could 2 heal UBRS all day ere'day. We could also turn the tide in an evenly matched Warsong Gulch.... 
---
You could also do some pretty weird hybrid specs for PVP, and be damn near unkillable. Resto druids eat rogues for breakfast. And BoomChiknz are devastating in world pvp.... roots, and warstomp, and kitty stun, and bear charge, and heals, and moonfire, and holy shit why won't you just fucking die?!?!?!
---
So only shammy and UD have fear dispels? And what about offensive dispels?
---
they are fun if you play av to actually play av. they're not fun, if you play to rank.
---
Hi all, JELQGIRTH here.  This pic is currently my lockscreen on my phone, I look at it every day. I am constantly daydreaming about reaching that point some day in classic.  I come to you now in search of all your old official vanilla and private server keybinds that you crafty combat rogues are using or have used.  Looking for things such as all abilities that can be used in stealth or out of stealth easily accessible in either stance.  Consider this just me wanting to learn from others.
---
It doesn't remove magic dots or curses, I don't think they can remove anything a warlock would do. It is literally bleed/poison/disease, so any debuff that is one of them it will dispel and make immune.
---
I watched a druid solo one of the Onyxia key quest line world dragons that normally takes like a 10 man group to kill. It took 45 minutes, and wasn't fun to watch, but he did it, and I don't think any other class could have survived that long.
---
How do you kill that, which has no life?
---
It's not the +stats I'm wanting, it's the higher dps. Percentage-wise, the difference between white and green damage is higher the lower the weapon level.
---
Are you the same Kal that ran death disciples on magtheridon server by any chance?
---
Blizz has Australian servers for all their other games, so it's pretty safe to assume there will be at least 1 for classic.
---
It's not about stacking as much as why drag dead weight when there's perfectly good players playing more optimal classes and specs.
---

My friendly guy loaned me 5k gold for epic riding in BC and let me slowly pay him back no interest :(

---
Fer reals
---
Thanks so much for the shout out and the amazing gesture, I'm so happy you had your playstyle vindicated!!
---
My knowledge is from private servers but as a fresh lvl 60 orc combat rogue, I was able to solo the AV mines with food and bandages between pulls.  Anyone with enough awareness and experience can do it (given the private servers are close enough to the real thing).
---
Or they could have become meth addicts.
---
jesus chiminey...I like it
---
I've always found the Mage vs Rogue thing to depend on who has cooldowns available. Smart rogues wait until they see a mage light someone else up with the POM + Pyro, before they attack. 
---
But you can cheapshot + backstab + backstab + kidney shot + backstab + backstab and a mage is mostly dead at that point and hasn't done anything at all. 
---
If they do escape any of that a well timed blind, kick, or gouge can still give you the advantage.... Some +frost resist and vanish can be your friend as well. And vanish + sprint = they're not getting away, and now you can probably drop them with an ambush, or a garrote... silence them for 4 seconds? yes please.
---
On the other hand, if a mage catches you with range... you're probably going to die. too many DPS happening to quickly for you to do anything about it. 
---
/shrug
---
You are using some random video where ret pally is beating rogues and warriors on overall damage meter as a proof that "their DPS isn't as bad as people make it out to be".
---
So either:
---
a) You are comparing ret's dps to warriors/rogues
---
b) People in that video do garbage dps, so it proves nothing
---
Which one is it?
---
&lt;Pacifist&gt; KT Alliance
---
Thanks for the input. The video content is pretty heavy we agree. Videos are easy for the community to make so there are naturally a lot right now. We will be adding a specific filter so that written stuff can be seen and videos hidden. Also we hope to be able to get more and to feature a wider variety of content such as comics, fan fiction, art, and more.
---
One of the biggest goals of the site is that it can offer this kind of platform for a variety of content that sites like youtube can't. But in a more cohesive and searchable way that sites like reddit can't. We'll see if we hit our vision but that's the goal. Thanks for your suggestion.
---
&gt;That second guild sounds like it was created by a ~~man~~ 16 year old of taste and distinction.
---
Make crafting that weapon your first goal, from the moment you start in game, your first goal is to get Mining and blacksmithing. Don't bother with quests, just go mining. Kill mobs along the way and go mining.
---
Level up your blacksmithing and then craft that two handed weapon, maybe some runed copper whatever I don't remember. That's how you do it. At least back in the day that's how it was done, you decided to do something and you put the effort in and then when you got the thing, the thing was all the more special and felt all the more earned because of the time and effort you put into it.
---
Now the only question is, it's after how many months or years you have played MMO's in the past, are you able to revert your brain to find meaning in the effort it takes at that low-level to create that low-level weapon?
---
great meme
---
I never once said they were better though, what don't you understand. In fact in one of my earlier comments, i literally say you won't beat a warrior rogue in dps. You're putting words in my mouth.
---
The most important about weapons is their level for the dps, stats are secondary until end game
---
It is worth buying the highest level white weapons from vendors
---
This is all I need
---

---
I'd love to post this shit but 18 yr old me decided it would be a good idea to level alts with a bot in cata and now my main account is banned. T3/gm rogue and a warrior I played from tbc to cata with almost all achieves and every weapon(Inc legendary) and cool peice of gear in the game. Legit only reason I made a warrior was to collect items. Didn't even get to use transmog cause I was banned before it came out lol. What a stupid young adult I was.
---
Why is that?
---
When the stars align, the numbers can be taaaasty.
---
yeah ofc only dps matters in vanilla...
---
sure if you are slogging through wipes, but vanilla raids are so easy that if you need to stack good classes to do it, you are getting carried for a lack of skill
---
Out of interest, what time do American guilds tend to raid? Because being 11 hours ahead is still somewhat practicable at least on weekends.
---
You're probably right about Australasia, but I'm just curious.
---
Owlchickenmanbearpig*
---
It's also mental as well, you can walk 3mph fairly easy, where running for 10 minutes it's easier to quit (for me at least) I only do cardio after my workouts and its usually sprinting intervals I hate it.  If you dont walk on an incline,  I'd recommend sprint intervals.
---
Ayy
---
Can you upload a pdf of this??
---
I had a hard time grasping wow when I was young, so being able to buff people with my priest was the least I could do when adventurers passed by
---
I haven't played an MMO since TBC so won't be too hard. I don't plan on leveling mining or blacksmithing anyways though otherwise I would consider crafting the 2H copper axe.
---
Play a warrior first and level it to 60, on downtime when you are not playing with your brother or when you have 90% preraid/full rested xp level your mage. Farming gold on a warrior is a bit of a pain until DM East comes out and you can two man it with your brother or any other healer. For a mage the only thing you need is a set amount of mana (6k i believe?) to farm DM North effectively and make more gold.
---
I am playing as a paladin and even with my free 40 mount and half cost epic mount i will be leveling a mage to make myself gold at DM North. Granted, DM wont be out for a few months, in the meantime I will just make gold via professions.
---
Playing an orc warrior so you can "accidentally" click bloodfury while maintanking in raid to activate 'hard mode' for healers.
---

Then you just keep your eyes open for an opportunity in game, or make friends with a blacksmith and trade them something

Dead weight is going to be dead weight regardless of class or spec. Throwing a tantrum because people aren't replicating cookie cutter specs to your personal preference is childish.
---
Plus it's actually pretty useful as a lowbie and CHEAP.  
---
Goddamnit can't wait for classic damnit!

Turn on treasure hunt racial and hang out near caves.

That sounds awesome. I love SM too. I hope you're right!

What a waste of paper
---
No one gives love to my troll brothers
---
Remember when people used to say “you killed it” when you kept repeating the same joke. I think you just killed this meme.
---
I’m looking to max level and then PVP primarily. What should I go with?
---
... Okay? How much dps does a mage do in that weird mix of mediocre pre-raid and ZG gear?
---
obviously a gnome with orb of deception.
---
Prepare for a childish world then cause that shit is coming. Anything sub-optimal will be recognized as such. Don't expect people to not treat it that way.
---
&gt; I never once said they were better though
---
And I never said that you've said such thing either.
---
&gt; Just don't go around claiming that ret's dps is anywhere near as good as rogue or warrior.
---
Anywhere near as good =/= better
---
All I'm trying to say is that linking some random video where ret is keeping up with warriors and rogues is extremely misleading
---
Their dps IS as bad people make it out to be, people have spent the past 15 years trying to figure this stuff out. Some random "streamer" topping overall damage meters in a casual guild does not disprove any of that.
---
And again, I'm not telling anyone what they should or should not be playing, I couldn't care less about that. Just please don't make false claims and link some random video to as "proof". That doesn't help anyone.
---
I am guilty of pretty much all of these! =D
---
actually none of your post was true. But thanks for playing.
---
oh no, they don't want to waste time and actually want to choose the best players instead of gimping themselves D:
---
I agree
---
Wouldn’t be surprised to see a little something once the release date is set.
---
I loved giving away leveling potions to classes that can’t heal themselves.
---
Here Warrior, have a stack of health pots!
---
People deserve to have fun in the playstyle they want. If you want to be elitist and spend all your time spamming one button all of classic go for it man, Just take all the people with your mindset with you.
---
hey man, I'm through dealing with your sorry know-nothing ass who can only back up his opinion with insults. get back on the short bus, already.

I remember Psycho Mike on Loveline (late night radio talk show) giving this recommendation for a guy who wanted to lose weight.  The HIIT + weights.  It works but it certainly isnt enjoyable for me either.
---
What would be the point of beta testing a game that's already been beta tested?
---
Yep I was that feral druid in STV when I hit 34 or so. Couldn't kill the trolls because horde were so numerous in the area and kept killing me on their paladins. So I started stalking the paladins. Every single one. And camped them when they tried to run back to the FP safe zone. After I ganked 3 of them at least 2 times each I stopped getting ganked in that area for the rest of the day. Don't mess with a kitty druid.
---
Viable =/= Optimal
---
Fear is a magic ability, so pally/priest can remove it - it's just shamy has a special totem that breaks fear.  
---
Shaman/priest are the only classes with offensive dispel.

Lol was musing over this earlier today.

If there's one thing I'm concerned about, it's the opinion of the Postal Service.

---
It's actually fairly simple.  There is a dps breakpoint at which boomkin +4 lock/mage will do more dps than 5 lock/mage. If boomkin meet the breakpoint, it's best practice to take them instead of the 5th lock/mage.
---
Priest has levitate. You will definitely miss the water. You will love Mind Control, Fear, and Fade.
---
&gt;hasn't logged on in a long time
---
that's the sad thing with these kinds of people, they aren't appreciated at the time and usually quit eventually
---
We are past the days of mass marketing for video games though. New Triple As go nuts with marketing, but many of the minor releases or non-Triple As don’t do much for marketing. They just throw some money at a famous streamer and have them play it.
---
Many famous streamers have already come out saying they’re playing it, so I imagine they are going to use the grapevine rather than spending money on advertising.
---
I never tried them, but I've seen a lot of people here disagree with this.
---
I think the question is how they will be implemented. They were only done when necessary, and you could only do one every 6 months, where as in the current game you can pay a fee and do it whenever, however many times you want
---
He's valued because he can heal next week's raid when one of your healers is out sick or on vacation. Your 5th mage can't do that
---
Please stop shielding my poor leveling warrior.
---
Rage is scarce enough as it is, why do you want to see me suffer. :'( 
---
On a more serious note, love everyone buffing you as you cross paths. Even mages giving me int buff on my warrior. &lt;3 Thank you all.
---
Top DPS playing with streamer sycophants isn't an accomplishment but you do you. You won't get invites to any good raiding guilds but I'm sure you know that. :)

Hi, /u/EliseOrSomething
---
Stay mad buddy. I'm rolling with a group of friends.
---
Ahhhhhh now that's more like it
---
The difference between racials isn't really as important as paladin vs shaman in classic wow. When it comes to PvE or serious battleground/honor grinders allaince is better, while random PvP horde has better racials, so I think it will actually be rather balanced
---
Blowjob. 
---
This is what I was expecting when I came to this thread.. but it was so pointed :-/
---
I've heard the recommendation a lot. I'm not trying to lose weight, mostly increasing stamina, and a change in a workout.
---
They specifically changed it in an early patch, in 1.12 they just don't stack.
---
This is really cool, on another note I hope you guys don't get burned out by minmaxing this hard, that's not an attack or anything I wanted to do it too but I feel like it ruins all the fun
---
It's going to be like this in-game too, people just typing out shitty memes in general all the time.

You better get ready to spam heal the shit out of yourself.

---
just don't tell them
---
I can't afford respeccing twice a week to raid and pvp with respec prices being so high, on k3 it's 5g per which is tolerable
---
it's because of procs, ret paladins are not good in vanilla and the only way you're going to get a geared one is if you are funneled loot from your friends or you are still doing mc for bindings when aq40 is out and you get all the gear people don't need anymore
---
Me too man! Here’s hoping for June 29!!
---
I wanna gonorc but I know it’s going to stress my buddy out so I’ll probably chose troll even though I really want axe specialization I just know I’m gonna regret it from all the times I use the ap buff.
---
The nice-guy part is that they're doing it there for free instead of buying cheap gear off the AH and then re-posting it for 1/2g more but with the enchant added on like it's some kind of favor, but you know the guys who are doing that are really just trying to make gold (which is okay) but they aren't nice guys - they're just working class citizens who don't believe in free handouts. (Also okay). Probably Trump supporters and MAGA hat wearers. (Also okay). While the guys running around giving free enchants are basically Obama. (Also okay). And will be missed when they leave, never really having accomplished much more than making other people happy. (Also okay).
---
Playing the long con with a name like that!

Found the blizz gm

Lol, I remember back on retail vanilla that happened. I felt bad. Never did shield on the warriors after 😂
---
God the truth *feels so right*
---
&gt;Chasing you down to buff you
---
Haha I’ve done this too many times. It’s like, cmon, 3 more yards and I can buff you, just stop moving for 1 second!
---
play orc
---
...those are the guys I like to trade a couple stacks of water to when I'm playing a mage
---
Hey now, there's nothing wrong with a little (too much) hentai
---
I think they will release the game when it’s ready. Isn’t that how blizzard normally works?
---
Keybinding is 100% personnal preference tbh.... you're not gonna be better at the game because you use the keybinds of others. :)
---
1. This platform is for sharing personal opinions.  I haven't once claimed that anything I said is a fact.
---
2. I said that rolling need on an item so that you can sell it even though another member could eqiup it is the definition of ninjalooting.  Stop making shit up to support your argument.  
---
3. BoE items aren't dropping left and right, they are extremely rare.  They can only be acquired from the AH if you happen to have a big pile of gold burning a hole in your pocket.  Also, 5 man dungeons typically only drop blues.  Stop pretending like it's the same thing.  
---
4. Whether or not a player should use an item isn't up to you.  There is no equal opportunity in a group other than everyone getting an opportunity to find gear to upgrade, which you are insisting should be taken away.  Telling people how to play their characters isn't my job, nor is it yours.
---
Literally just walked into STV and there were horde camping the flight path and the Nesingwary quest area...why do I do this to myself....
---
yeah troll is the best warrior to minmax with if you're planning on playing to the end of vanilla
---
They’re not, this guy is just very biased.
---
Have fun in Deadmines!
---
NICE
---
why watermark such a bad edit job
---
Warrior for warrior priest combo
---
Even chain chugging mana pots doesnt fix their oom issues. Also, BWL onwards? I'd be stunned if they wouldn't go oom right from the get in MC
---
Asking Race and Faction is redundant.

Blizzard went on to make their own Warcraft tcg so odds are it was a nod at MTG
---
If you wanna know how to level in classic, play a private server and level through. You'll know exactly what to do when you play classic. I am moving with my private server guild to official servers and you can be sure we will kick ass and take names.
---
If you PvP at level 60, that is up to you.  I need this item because I'm going to focus on PvP 20-40 levels from now is a bullshit argument.
---
I did this on a TBC server. I hit 70 and felt really accomplished. I vowed never to put myself through that again, then I made a hunter...
---
For the love of all that is Holy...Priest no
---
&gt; HOw someone else earns (or doesn't earn) their stuff doesn't invalidate what others did. My first car was bought with money that I earned over the span of 3 summer jobs, my friend got his bought by his parents, this fact didn't diminish my accomplishments or how I felt about earning my vehicle. I don't live my life or play my games based on other peoples accomplishments.
---
Your hard work earning that car probably made the car mean much more to you than his meant to him.
---
They said you can’t be both on the same PvP server
---
What’s up with the gatekeeping and not allowing people to play humans?
---
Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars are all fantasy movies and have humans....
---
He probably would have gone horde if you weren’t so damn controlling and telling him what he can play and cannot play.
---
This is a private server bug.
---
This but with canceling cast as well. 
---
 Idk thats what they had me doing back when, hell I was super young so maybe it was wrong.
---
I guess I was thinking more about spell casters in general than specific classes, but my issue is more with a rogue or warrior auto rolling on a staff when a mage, priest, etc could actually benefit from it.
---
They mean craft one.  You can make a Copper Battle Axe at level 8.
---
first time i did aq40 i got whirlwinded by a warrior for 5k lol
---
You just made me sad
---
go orc if thats what you want
---
Yeah but the meme is still dead
---
I tanked a lot of Vanilla too - and I will warrant most ret pally's threat was laughable. But, the guy I told you about, he was a threat monster. He would literally pull aggro at will, even with Blessing of Salvation. It was nuts - the guy was a complete rockstar at Pally. I can safely say he did everything as well as you can possibly do with a paladin, and he still plays today. But during Vanilla, he would never be able to top DPS meters solely because his threat was far too high, and that was that. So instead he would spec Holy and top healing/cleanse meters, because he was simply better at timing his abilities and using judgements (he got yelled at a lot for standing too close to the boss since he wouldn't quit using judgements, or melee'ing the boss to regain mana in-between heals if he could - he was hilarious and always tweaking mechanics like that to his advantage, long before things like that were considered "standard practice" by the elitests).  
---
But thanks for explaining the threat tables ranged vs. melee stuff - I had forgotten exactly how that worked, but now that you've mentioned it, that rings a bell somewhere... memory's not what it used to be, that's for sure.
---
\*Teaches you how to AoE farm in Tanaris, with a frost mage...  I forgot their name, but will never forget their kindness or the experience.
---
this is one of the ones that i was worried about too, but i think worse than that is going on a server that ends up getting populated by streamers
---
there will be nothing in trade other than braindead people jerking off streamers 24/7, no idea how people can enjoy that

Absolutely. Half the time they're spying for the other faction, because rogues...
---
You beat Bellygrub in Lakeshire, Princess is in Elwynn =)
---
Just be prepared for the troll responses. every time one of these is posted people submit impossible class/race combos or put their age as like 9 with hunter or something
---
1 hour cooldown -10 from totem -20 from improve reincarnation (rnk 2) = 30 minute cooldown. Also you don't come back at full hp/mana and aggro would reset.
---
Asking because a lot of private servers use incorrect xp rates for 1.12 and that could explain why his times are so off from the leaderboard
---
Gnome it is
---
No. They aren't touching the actual data. If you want balancing go BfA that was their answer to balancing.
---
What is? In retail vanilla as far as i remember sitting caused you to be crit 100% of the time
---
I’m tripping or maybe not, but I thought you could only throw shields on party memebers?

I had nightfall and still got told off.

Stamina for me definitely came from inclined walking.  Slowly i went from 9 to 12 to 15% and then pushed it up to a 3.5 mi/h pace.  Eventually i was able to run a 10 minute mile, and that may not sound like much, but Id never come anywhere close to that before.
---
Hopefully you find what works for you
---
Let's say you're healing a 5 man. Your tank is taking lots of small damage. Nothing big, but you're gonna need to heal him occasionally. The retail mindset would be to roll hots on him at all times while casting small heals. This isn't always the case in classic. Sometimes you're better off waiting for your tank to get low, hitting him with your max rank heal, topping him off and then waiting for the 5 second rule and letting your mana regen in between big heals. This way you're only casting one spell and you're maximizing the uptime on your mana regen.
---
May you find joy in your Sisyphian labor.
---
I remember soloing mines with BWL gear on my Paladin, so as long as you have gear and enough CDs you should be able to do it.
---
Every pserver I play on though, the patrol spawns in the mines seem to be bugged to respawn super fast and also overlap eachother, making it pretty much impossible to solo non-stealth and even a pain to do 3 man with how much the spawns overlap eachother. The mob vs mob fighting also never seems to work right on pservers.
---
I'm glad you have friends that are willing to carry the dead weight of a ret in vanilla. It's nice to have good friends, is it not?
---
Also, that's irrelevant. I dunno why you're dick wagging. Must have bruised your ego a bit I guess.
---
There are multiple issues with playing noted bad off specs in PvE. The most obvious one is the floor of bad specs. Even a terrible played "pure" dps class can, at minimum, do double if not triple the dps of an equally poorly played off spec. It really is that vast. It requires SO much more work to make off specs remotely decent and most are not willing to put in the work thus making them deadweight. People can play what they like. Their money, their time but raiding is a joint venture that requires many people's money and time. They cant be blamed for not wanting to waste it on someone who isnt going to put in the work and work it is. 
---
For PvP, on the other hand, who gives a shit. PvP is where experimentation is rewarded
---
You can't just do /sit to proc your "after being a victim of a critical strike" skills/talents.
---
:3 I will try.
---
The thing is, I was a tauren and most basically said I am a bad meme for not at least being an orc (axe specc). But I love taurens and hate orcs, so that's kinda fucked.
---
AND I EVEN HAD PRE-BIS.
---
And yes, my specc was purely for PvE raiding. Warriors in my group did massive damage and that's not fucking accidental.
---
Reeee and so on.
---
&gt; If I can spend 20 hours or $20 to get my epic mount, i will always spend the money.
---
Yeah. If the option is available you're foolish not to take it. WoW tokens are sort of like having your addictive food of choice (candy, soda, beer) in the pantry in that it's just a constant battle of willpower not to indulge. Best to not even buy them at the grocery story / not even have tokens in the game. 
---
&gt;I would be totally cool with one way discount tokens, though. Maybe like 500g a month to half your monthly sub price. Just as a way to get gold out of the economy.
---
Interesting idea.
---
Yeah that’s kinda how it works. If more people agree that it’s a dead meme then it must be dead.
---
I mean... you're not wrong... shoot, they could be dead. There's a story on some anime somewhere about some guild of kids who band together because they're all sick or something, basically they're dying. So they play because they want to have fun before they die, or something... sounds super depressing, but I suppose that's probably more realistic than we want to imagine.  
---
I work in a building that fluctuates between 1200 - 1500 workers, and I learned from a former employee (he was an assistant to the building's manager) that between 3-15 people at any given time are basically living out their last few months/years in life, with known conditions that cannot be cured.  
---
I can only imagine how many people like that resorted to leaving the world behind to delve into something like WoW. And somewhere along the way, they realized that the best way to enjoy life is to make others happy - even in just a game. And by leaving quietly, knowing they could never return, they would leave a happy memory, and be missed. Yet for some reason, they never shared that they could never return. Maybe because they didn't want to hurt their friends, or maybe for other personal reasons - I like to think it would be because they wanted to leave positive, happy memories, without the pain of a permanent loss - maybe even a little hope that one day they just might beat this thing, and come back...
---
Don't remember, someone else might have to answer that one
---
Some people don’t work this hard on their masters thesis
---
Nah i just love proving morons wrong, stay mad buddy.
---
I was in knights of oblivion around September/ October of 2006, no idea what I was doing at the time only a couple months into the game
---
I always wanted an offhand book with glowing runes. I thought that looked so cool!
---
If you are planning to race to world first 60 you should be wary unless you have a lot of friends and know people at Blizzard, there are going to be a lot of streamers with 20+ people helping them the entire way, some on the other faction ganking people that are catching up (they won't claim to be related so they don't get banned for cross faction collusion), and anyone who kills the streamer is going to get reported for "griefing" and Blizzard will probably cave to it since it will be them vs you.
---
You seem fairly upset, my dude.
---
&lt;The Paragon&gt; on Scilla. I played a pally, Kupo. We were pretty good, considered the third best raiding guild on our server for the alliance. Sadly we broke up just before BC released.
---
As a graduating college senior, I don’t care anymore. When faced with “working until I die,” any amount of time is fine by me.
---
They will never do it, because it would eat up profits, but it would help the in game economy.
---
I'm a strength guy, powerlifting, strongman are what i love. I work evenings so my incline are the damn escalators that are turned off. I climb those often. Thats really good to hear hitting goals. Don't wanna go into my old running stats cuz they used to be super amazing and now they are dog crap. If you like running or conditioning I highly recommend getting a road bike and just going for 20 mile cruises. So much fun and relaxing.
---
Dark runes as well, and self innervates can carry them through most of it.
---
You claiming to define that as ninjalooting is definitely false and an example of you presenting your point of view as if it's some kind of fact.
---
Ninjalooting is taking something without giving everyone else a fair roll on it. If everyone rolls need on a BoE that makes 4 ninjas in a group by your evaluation which is just absurd. 
---
If I'm playing with randoms we're all rolling need, that's just the most fair thing to do, especially when not all 5 people are agreeing to let something very valuable go to one player by default.
---
If by upset, you mean stating facts? Sure.
---
... Who was it?
---
This was the best part of Vanilla WoW. Even if real life sucked, WoW was always there.
---
No. Vanilla's community is very small and niche, and Blizzard's intention is not to market the game to new players, rather, to people who are already fans of it.
---
Well thanks for getting serious and throwing that depression on me.
---
Maybe they don't tell anyone because they don't want people to act different or treat them different because they have a limited time left.  Maybe they just wanted to be 'one of the guys' for a minute, be treated like everyone else... normal.
---
I like the cut o' yer jib.
---
Does your guild happen to be in the market for a memespec freak of nature?
---
Yeah because it’s totally worth it to go out of your way to get best in slot greens for level 5...
---
Yes.
---
Like i said have fun spamming one button all of class.
---
It’s been a while but playing on a private server about a year ago I swear I tried to throw a shield up on a fellow hordie* to protect him from what would be preventing him from a corpse run.... but it wouldn’t go... and he died.... 😭😭
---
But the people who initiated this whole thing are people who liked the game as is, who are you to take that away from them?
---
OMG I HAVE MISSED THIS FOR YEARS!!!!!!
---
Epic- staff of Jordan. Off a random scorpion in tanaris. Sold for 300 gold and I got my first mount
---
Druid/Priest 3set T2 bonus is really nice. however, nothing beats 3set T2 for shamans. that shit is so insane, ppl wore i in TBC until it got patched
---
Playing a priest pre-40 on a PvP server is AIDS.  Once you get shadow form at 40 though, the tables turn and people will either leave you alone, or you'll have a good fighting chance. If not, before you die, drop a fresh SWP as a little fuck you on your way out.
---
It's really bad though. I'm going paladin if I heal this time, or shaman if horde. Priest is just too squishy in PvP if you want to heal. Shadow is pretty fun, and I can kill pretty much anything if my mana is full...therein lies the problem....you burst through mana really fast and spend a lot of time drinking. Full mana though, you're a goddamn terrorist.
---
But isn't your regen from spirit higher when out of combat?
---
The 49 bracket was great, you had most of your full kit, more talents to play around with and a decent range of gear options compared to the earlier brackets. Also mounts.
---
Yeah id say with over gearing litterally any spec is viable in dungeons
---
A man of culture
---
Thanks. This is what I was after.
---
yes, MC+Ony will be out at launch
---
I'm on the fence between a Holy Paladin and Restoration Druid. The one major downside to druid for me is no out of combat rez, but that is pretty minor. Holy Paladins and Restoration Druids both appeal to me in the class fantasy area but I'm just not able to decide on which one. 
---
Druids seem like they aren't the typical whack-a-mole type of healer, but do they have the big heals in case things go south like a Paladin brings? Is there anything to Holy Paladins besides single target casted heals?
---
Do I need to be a healing spec for leveling in case I run some dungeons along the way or can I get by with a dps spec and off heal?
---
What professions do these classes usually run with? Classic is way new to me. I started playing in Wrath so this is going to be a brand new game.
---
&gt; I like paladin tanks because I use them and have fun with them.
---
This is literally all you need to know to make your decision.
---
My guild accepts all creatures born of the natural order*
---
Well, you're a proven liar so I don't think you should hop aboard the facts train. :)
---
It costs nothing but a fraction of in game time and makes life great for others. I never understand why more people aren't helpful in game.
---
I had a human priest on aerie peak called fonzzy- this may have been early TBC thou
---
Hi, about me at bottom.
---
NA 
---
PvP server
---
Either faction but prefer Horde.
---
Rogue preferred, Warlock otherwise. 
---
Will be available from 1600 to 2200 (at the absolute latest) CST.  I currently work M-F from 2300 to 0700 at the earliest with no exceptions and at least one weekend a month (could potentially be working 0530 to 1500 for months at a time as well).  I'm mainly looking for an early raid time CST guild or EST raid time guild due to the hour difference between timezones.  Prefer no more than 4 days a week of raiding.
---
I'd like to PvP and progression raid seriously but not hardcore.  Good social chemistry preferred!  That's part of the reason Classic will be great.
---
Reddit message or Kedali#8833 for Discord.
---
About: Full-time employment, part-time classes, married with no kids (yet) and wife enjoyed retail but is willing to try Classic with me (Priest or Druid).  I played from 2005 to MoP release (not including the one month stint of WoD and Legion) and was primarily competitive PvP focused but did at least a couple raid tiers per expansion except WoD (none) and Legion (did mostly 15+ keys and some heroic Argus in my one month).  I used to love this game.  MoP and onward have taken that love away.  I'm looking for some like-minded people to reclaim the love!
---
Who said anything about level 5 ?
---
Is it a minor release though? We saw a ton of TV and online marketing for BFA which is effectively just a big update for an existing game.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCo3\_LclJKU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCo3_LclJKU) and Classic is a complete stand-alone product developed by Blizzard. Something they didnt just tweak the old client and re-release it.
---
I remember ion hazzikostas said at Blizzcon Q&amp;A that he didnt want to imply that Retail is the "Real game"
---
LF NA Saturday/Sunday morning raiding guild. I am in the CST time zone and plan to play Shaman.  I have private server experience and have played retail since TBC. Always as a healer so I'm comfortable in that role. I also plan to PvP at Max level.
---
Next level play, this.
---
It's actually before level 11 :)
---
I'm probably going to end up leveling a lot of alts. But i still can't pick a main. I keep changing my mind. Druids are kinda bad in classic but i just love the class fantasy. So it's either that or a mage, or a pally...
---
Not to mention, BiS is little more than a handicap for lack of skill anyway. The only reason I like it is if it helps calm down the loot-whores (although more often than not it encourages them, as everything less than BiS they need in order to GET BiS, and then when BiS drops, they MUST HAVE IT because it is BiS, even though they needed EVERYTHING else up to that drop anyway...)
---
I don’t think they want to sell Classic as a new game. Remastered? Yes, but it’s not anything ground breaking.
---
I imagine they are going to spend the least amount of money on this project to make the most passive income they can.
---
But the belt is wrong x.x
---
I can't think of any at the moment but I'm sure there are a lot of cool Goblin and Gnome quests!
---
You realize op was asking about green weapons from Coldridge valley right... 
---
inb4 you tell me the weapon you had in mind is actually level 7!!!
---
I think prot works perfectly well for class fantasy too. Even holy's fine as a backup to one of the other two. Paladins *are* a support class, after all, just a full-plate-on-the-front-lines one.
---
I remember doing that as a druid. Bear and self heals FTW.
---
I'm hoping that they offer free character transfers IF your server happens to be insanely overpop or badly balanced etc.  They did do this in original vanilla so it's possible, doesn't break the #nochanges.
---
GM: "Hey babe, get on vent..."  
---
GF: "Hi"  
---
GM: "MY GOD, you sound HIDEOUS!"  
---
GF: "You hurt my feelings, I want T2"  
---
GM: "Ok"  
---
Guild: "Why does Jeff keep getting all the loot??"
---
It's not really out of the way. It's just an elite quest in Dun Morogh. With so many players online, it will be easy to form a group. Waiting for the respawn however...
---
8-10.
---
Like... that's what 6 hours in max?  
---
Get some better friends!
---
I think you should add an option for unsure to class, race, etc. I want to do the survey but I am still not sure of what I want to play yet.
---
not vanilla but haunted memento is my most cherished item from ever playing wow
---
We do know, and they do.
---
orc is by far the best race in the game, not playing it because your friend is a weirdo is just a strange choice
---
&gt; Maybe I'm not seeing the whole picture, can someone explain to me why this would be a bad idea?
---
Because the thing you're asking for wasn't in Vanilla.
---
This'll be less of an issue nowadays though because those languages have their own servers.  Back in original vanilla they only ran english/french/german localizations so you got a lot of majority portuguese, spanish, russian "servers".
---
So... no, then?
---
What if I bring my healing set with me to PvP?
---
I may be a meme spec but I'm not a monster.
---
Old vanilla would start queueing you @ around 2.5-3k concurrent pop.  So yeah you won't be getting any 10k pop servers I'm afraid.
---
Going for an elite quest for a weapon is a great idea if there isn’t too much competition.
---
Yeah like im going to advice him on a random overpriced boe.
---
Triggered died 3 years ago man... you try so hard to be edgy it makes my skin crawl.  Have fun getting nowhere ;)
---
Oh damn it's a lvl 12 weapon. The quest can be accepted at lvl 6 so I assumed the weapon was that level.
---
What's the point of alpha testing a game that's already been alpha tested? Gotta find them major bugs and get them all fixed up. You'd be amazed at how many major bugs get caught in these tests especially now that they have to make all of this integrate with the new Battle.net APIs in a nice and friendly way
---
So you advise him to spend 1-2 hours gathering to craft a weapon lol
---
To make sure all the NPC and quests are in the game? It's an in house alpha test.
---
Honestly I'd go even further and say blizz ought to let you 'book' the server you're going to play on.  Not that it would require you to stick to it, but then we'd be able to see rough numbers and balance and things.  Realistically alliance will outnumber horde on most servers, like at original launch, but a healthy realm shouldn't be more than 10% pop swing either way imo.
---
Specs don't matter; what matters is how ~~delicious~~ ~~delectable~~ *friendly* you are. :V
---
2hrs you are bad at copper
---
Yeah... I've had one too many lessons in perspectives like this. Got to a point now where when I see someone acting out (or doing drugs), I actually wonder if they aren't going through something like this - or maybe just lost someone this way. Who knows. All I can do is try to make the next person feel the way they made me feel. Like I was special - not because I deserved it, but because that's just what they did. Made people feel special.  
---
And that's probably the most wonderful thing a person can do.
---
Hey I agree WC3 has a very different, unique story. But the concepts of hatreds between warring groups being insignificant compared to the true threat and the need for all the living to ally together eventually against the undead, was already the obvious direction of the ASOIAF books, even if the actual substance of the story was completely different. The fact that WC3 took that theme of allying all the living against an undead enemy just a few years after these books came out is suspect, but some other details like the title of the last Frozen Throne mission IMO almost confirm it. If the writers of the WC3 story had recently started reading the series, which that mission title pretty much confirms, it would have been pretty much tough for them to completely separate out how much their creative insight/direction they wanted to go was being impacted by a story they had just read.  
---
They could have still taken the WC3 story in a similar direction anyway given the nature of the warcraft series, but it likely would have been at least a little different if the moment of inspiration happened at a different time of in a different way. There's a good chance a specific character like Jaina wouldn't exist, or that Northrend/Lich king might have been different, or the specific geography of towns that developed over the story, or there even may have been a different race involved instead of the undead.
---
Got so mad, he has to call me a liar with no evidence. How am i a liar?
---
The joke is that a dwarf's perspective is a drunken one =&gt; the beer goggles effect
---
&gt; Get Horde/Alliance balance right
---
How exactly can blizz get this "right"?  The only way they could do it would be to block creation of characters on a specific faction or such.  This would be massively unpopular, imagine your friends just made chars on X realm and you go there and it's locked due to balance and you can only make chars on the opposite faction.  Imagine the shitstorm that would come from that.
---
Fact is there's not much they can do, best thing is probably to pick a high pop server and make sure it doesn't look like your faction is completely dead before rolling there.  It'll be pretty hard to see though at first because all the low level areas will be mad populated anyway.  Likely will have to just start leveling and then see what it looks like after a bit of time and if it looks bad, reroll somewhere else.
---
Still in a facebook group with the old guild
---
Will never happen - for reasons I posted above.
---
&gt; but do they have the big heals in case things go south like a Paladin brings? Is there anything to Holy Paladins besides single target casted heals?
---
NS+max rank HT is basically lay on hands with a 3 minute cooldown without using all your mana. Frankly, druids have a much more versatile healing toolkit than paladins, who only have 2 direct heals, one of which is less mana efficient than downranked healing touch. Flash of light is very efficient, which is good, but limited in throughput. It's the only healing spell that is regularly spammed at max rank by any healer in the game; every other healer manages mana and throughput by downranking as necessary. 
---
Paladins are the sine qua non of tank healers. Druids can tank heal- almost as efficiently as paladins, with HT4- or they can raid heal with regrowth and rejuv (or more HT as appropriate). Druids can look like poor healers if the raid has too many healers or the other healers (priests, primarily) are agressively using mana-intensive fast heals. Personally, I find the paladin healing style boring, but easy. Druids are more flexible, but not as flexible as priests. 
---
The role of druids in raids also differs between alliance and horde. Because paladins are the ultimate tank healers, and shaman are the ultimate aoe healers, an alliance druid will use more of their mana healing non-tanks while a horde druid will usually be prioritized to tank healing. 
---
If you want to maximize your effectiveness, engineering is the best profession for any class. Supplement this with mining, so you don't need to buy your own materials. For paladins, there is little reason to take any other professions (anything you need from alchemy is easily purchased on the AH, or level an alchemy alt to 35 for transmutes). For druids, the BIS tank trinket in vanilla requires 265 enchanting to craft, but you don't need to keep enchanting to use it (although I'd hesitate to drop enchanting once you have it to that level, as it is expensive to level up). Get to 300 enchanting asap (not hard to do by the time, or shortly after you hit 60) and get your guild to give you MC recipes, and you can make some decent money that way. Your second prof should probably be herb, mining, or skinning, purely for income. Engineering is somewhat less OP for druids than any other class, as there are a number of items that can't be used in beast forms, but a tryhard pvp druid is likely to still take it.
---
Will it have the option to pause xp gain, though?
---
&gt;People do not need mounts. Don't get me wrong, mounts are awesome, but you already made it 40 levels without one
---
40 is not even half of the way brother, and the runs get much much longer
---
This is what i was looking for, Thank you.
---
what kind of work blocks spotify
---
yes but you can find a group, and so it earlier if you are lucky.  you can also look here,  [https://classicdb.ch/?items=2](https://classicdb.ch/?items=2)  and search then you know what you can get and when. Maybe you are planning a guide or something, i dont know :)
---
&gt;Goes afk mid boss fight to pet a dog
---
This is the one that got me hahaha
---
It sure is fun to talk to people that say anything to defend their bad ideas lol
---
Yes!!! My biggest dilemma is getting to 60 without trying to create several alts first. I hope I get to 60 so i can start a twink and have him geared before Warsong Gulch releases.
---
&gt; You've already proven yourself a tourist
---
Also how am I a tourist lmao, I've been playing since vanilla and was fighting for classic servers long before they were announced. I still remember signing the petition after Nost got shut down. 
---
You're just labeling me and assuming things without backing it up.
---
That's a funny icon for a pack of hunters.
---
It was patched out a few months after release, and then added back in Wrath.
---
Man, I strongly recommend against contracts right now, it's such a shit show. If you do contract, make sure you're extremely clear cut and don't let them dick you around. Ask for everything you want up front in the contract or they'll screw you. I worked a few contracts before I took up work for an MSP and I'll never go back.
---
warriors are NOT casual friendly. Paladin dps is an off-spec that isn't optimal in either pve or pvp. I'd recommend rogue as a casual/alt dps. Although they do scale well with gear, you can have fun with "weaker" gear as long as it isn't total garbage. Full MC gear, especially if you can get perd's blade with CHT or another good offhand, is good enough to really enjoy pvp against anyone that isn't in full AQ40+ gear.
---
That's pretty common practice nowadays unfortunately. One of the guys at my work failed his Watch guard cert 3 times because he kept getting shit on with his tests, and one of the guys who's overall less knowledgeable passed his first try.
---
Orc is the best race for any class that can choose it (including rogues, IMHO, who are already stong against warlocks)
---
you know you need 12 copper ore to make a 2h right ? that takes you 2hrs, you are doing something wrong
---
Dude orc is literally the best race on horde for melee.  Think WOTF is op? not really, 35% base stun resist is OP tho...
---
Honestly as someone who mained a paladin in vanilla (and more recently on naughty servers too) - you can't fucking stun orcs.  HoJ on an orc feels like a 50:50 shot at best most of the time.  The number of times on discord im like 'omg actually stunned an orc' because it's so fucking rare lol.
---
That plus +5 axes and a usable 25% attack power buff cooldown is pretty damn sick as far as racials go.
---
&gt;This but with canceling cast as well. 
---
Yea that's heal queuing. You cancel the cast mid cast so it doesnt cast and waste mana. In a PvP situation it has a different meaning, where cancel casting becomes fake casting to try and bait the interrupt. Most people dont fall for fake casts anymore.
---
I hate trolls and have never played one, racials be damned. Orc 4 life!
---
I’m “gatekeeping” because 99% of the time people complain that online friends aren’t considered real, they are teenagers whose parents badger them for shunning real life friends in favor of online ones.
---
I’ve seen this argument happen like a dozen times on this sub before, and I figured that I’d be the one to say it this time.
---
*-moans in Berserker Stance-*
---
Anything works for 5/10 mans
---
Some people even prefer pally tanks for those.
---
The issue with them has always been in raids, due to the reasons that you've listed
---
shadow is not really the best pvp spec for a priest. DoTs break important CC's in competitive pvp. Shadow is only good for meaningless 1v1 duels or maybe wpvp, but if you get 2v1, you're gonna die anyway. Shadow is a leveling spec and a poor raid dps spec only brought to buff warlocks (and some guilds just have a hoyl priest put enough points into shadow to throw up the debuff, while mostly healing).
---
Server transfers existed in Vanilla.
---
Orc
---
If it's between those three, I'd personally start with the Mage. Even if you don't raid/PvP with it, they're a lot easier to level, and they make excellent farmers for the other two classes. (For instance, say you need mats to drop from three different zones on both continents to craft that amazing new helm - you can portal around a lot quicker than using the boats/flying mounts, and then you roll up, AoE them down, loot, port, mail to main, done).  
---
Although I suppose if you find an active playerbase to start with, you may be able to go Holy Pally to start with, as finding groups will be very easy to do, and if the PvP gets too hot (assuming you're on a PvP realm) you can eventually just bubble-hearth away. And then if anyone starts ganking your mage, just log onto your Pally, engage them in combat and annoy them until they leave the zone because they can't kill you.
---
Someone needs to tell the site that you get AP from Int as well.
---
You could just spam log into many servers of your preferred server type and reserve your character name on all of them, that way if you ever need to transfer in the future, you won't lose it. That's my plan on launch minute 0.
---
There tends to be less Warlocks on Alliance due to Will of the Forsaken on undead ruining fear. You are more valued specifically in raids, because they can still deal great damage and have access to Paladin buffs to help with threat, which horde warlocks don't. 
---
Personally, I am going Gnome Warlock due to wanting to do raids, but not wanting to play mage.
---
It’s me!
---
its like "hogger" of the gnome/dwarfs, so there is always people there :)
---
feral tanks (at least with 1.12 talents) are actually quite competitive with warriors, but guilds will usually have a warrior main tank. If I were running a raid, I'd want a prot main tank and a bear-spec feral OT and choose who tanks the boss depending on the fight. Feral tanks take slightly more damage, but also have higher HP (can live through bigger spikes without dying and wiping the raid) and can put out substantially better threat than a prot war. Every other tanking role required can be filled by a dps warrior with tank gear.
---
Now i wanna try WoW
---
druids need so many bag slots its not funny. 
---
hunters don't need to carry around 2.5 sets of gear at all times.
---
Besides cuddly Tauren, they sometimes also come in Female Undead form, otherwise perfect summary.
---
I'm not sure gladiator paladin in current WoW has anything to do with classic.  But yes, everybody knows that is a really strong combo in PvP, but so is any paladin/DPS combo.
---
#nochanges RAGE!!!!
---
Yeah hunter scaling is pretty awful.
---
This is the guy I aim to be.
---
I appreciate that response. many would disagree with you though lol
---
Lll nope.  Warsong is a brazilian server
---
In fact I did give advice! I said he should buy a white weapon and get a green from a quest. 
---
Apparently you also lie to defend your bad ideas lol
---
I had this friend from TBC onward. He randomly joined our new 5-man guild despite having like 8 characters and being completely established himself. He in his 60s, a chill metalhead, and his job title was still "Webmaster" even well into the 2010s. He farmed gold all day and shared it with everyone, and 90% of his replies to things was just a smiley face with sunglasses: "8)".
---
He passed away a bit over a year ago, and of all the people I've know who have passed away, it's amazing to me that it was the passing of a man who I had never met in real life that affected me the most. He was a wonderful person, and I'm honored to have known him.
---
Why should I care what people who disagree with me think? :D
---
I remember getting beast slaying on my staff of west fall on my priest. Glorious.
---
You mean Iron Forge
---
ele/resto shaman suck without good gear. You need lots of SP, stam, and enough int to pay for loads of spells/heals/totems. 
---
Spriest is probably the best with bad gear, but it isn't actually a good spec for pvp. 
---
hotw druid (0/30/21) is a great pve spec for 5-man content since you can effectively tank OR heal. Like spriest, it isn't really a good pvp spec. Druids are not terribly gear dependent in terms of needing lots of high-end epics to be competitive, but they are gear dependent in terms of benefiting greatly from very specific items. Some of which are easy to get, some of which are not.
---
I never did the vanilla pvp grind. How much of a time investment does it take to get to rank 14?
---
Right, I'm saying if you get the mana regeneration while cancel casting, cool. If not, it isn't going to matter. Just by maximizing your healing power to down rank and cancel casting while using mana pots, you will last every fight and be a good healer. Worrying about not healing a tank or a raid member because you're at 4 seconds of no casting will kill people.
---
this is way funnier
---
Ah, been a while
---
It really doesn’t even matter for them. If pservers are any indication. “The best premades” will collude and dodge each other. 
---
Hopefully going into wsg as a guild premade to smash other guild premades, simply to smash other premades will become a thing again. If pvp is premades dodging each other and premades never actually fighting premades (you know competition, the heart of fun) then wow vanilla will die off into the weird pserver fetish it currently is.
---
every caster in your raid will be begging for PI
---
it's better than holy for pvp. 
---
If I played priest, i'd be PI/holy. Only thing you give up is a little bit of extra efficiency in the holy tree. PI is worth it IMHO
---
not when you get to be fire
---
Hey mate

Watch this video: [https://youtu.be/yFbX5drsnAw](https://youtu.be/yFbX5drsnAw)

TLDR; To achieve rank 10 you will need to accumulate 40,000 ranking points. To achieve this you will need to overcome 20% decay (20% of 40,000 is 8000), meaning that in the final few weeks (to go from rank 9 to rank 10) you will need to achieve more than 8000 ranking points per week (at least, preferably more). 
---
TLDR2; To go from rank 9 to rank 10 over 4-5 weeks you would need to be in the top 3.5% of PvP'ers on your faction each week. To do the final rank faster, you would need to be even higher each week.
---
I’m planning on playing alliance rogue. I am not sure if I should i play human or dwarf tho. I plan on doing a mix of both pvp and pve.
---
It’s totally ok for 5-mans. Maybe some dungeons will be harder than others, but they’re all doable.
---
Plus, I’ve had a Paladin main tank Zul’Gurub before. It was honestly one of the smoothest runs I’ve ever had. One of the Warrior tanks was just being sloppy as hell, and the RL went from healer to prot. Want to say their name was Lestorr.
---
So don’t worry about 5-mans. You can easily make a group if you volunteer to tank, and honestly, most dps will be glad to have a tank at all. 
---
Plus, kings...
---
Honestly warstomp is just not that good for warriors in pvp.  It's not a game-changer like it is for druids or shamans.
---
That's a funny way to spell troll.
---
I was excited, I thought you meant they had an online atlas/atlasloot system that didn't require you to be in-game with the addon.
---
Alas.
---
And the post is low effort 💀
---
sounds like you are only talking about pvp.
---
in which case i would still argue that pet damage, axe skill, damage boost, and stun resist offer more in a lot of scenarios than one-time fear immunity or weak haste buff.
---
Not all fears are magic. The warlock and priest ones are but not warrior or onyxia, for example.
---
No way am I wearing that BiS I don’t care. It’s just soul destroying,
---
If you ever plan on making an alt, maybe make that alt first. I know I’m playing Pally/mage, so for example, I’m getting my mage to 6 or so, then getting my Pally their too, pooling the money together to buy a magic wand for my mage, then leveling the mage to 10-15. By then, I should have enough spare silver to buy my Pally a wep for lvl 5, 10, and 15.
---
&lt;Merciless&gt; on Onyxia.
---
Your spirit / out of combat mana regen doesn't kick in until you haven't completed a cast in 5 seconds.  So ideally you want to heal in bursts (when possible).  If you were to cast a heal every 4 seconds for example, you'll oom a lot faster than casting two heals every 8 because you have 3 seconds of spirit-based manage regn (8-5) to help you out.
---
Troll is the best pve choice, orc is the best pvp and best all-rounder choice.
---
You only go tauren warrior if you just have to be tauren for whatever, probably sexual, reasons.
---
Paladin healers who don't use Judgements are frustrating. Stand max judgement range from your groups target, judge, and watch players heal themselves, do additional damage, or regain mana. Use your down-ranked FoL spam, never go oom, keep cleansing targets (this happens a TON in Vanilla).  
---
By using these methods, you actually stay pretty engaged, along with applying re-buffs routinely. Most Pallys who find it "boring" aren't using their full toolkit. There are so many things you can do to improve a dungeon run - like switching aura's to help your group depending on circumstances, or stunning an extra add that broke CC, throwing a BoP on a mage during an AoE pull, hitting a tank with BoF so he can pull/kite/move through slow effects, then rebuffing Might/Kings etc. So many little things like that are easily forgotten, and add SO much to a group.  
---
Pallies who stand still and time a big heal every 3-5 seconds... yeah that's boring. And ineffective. Never underestimate the skill of a well-played toon, especially a paladin who is determined to have an effect on every aspect of each fight! It's more effective than a priest wanding between heals, and smoother than a druid rooting mobs while they're being kited around.
---
Maybe they don’t want to stir up too much hype, when private servers are a real option at the moment, and there’s no way to play the game. Maybe in the 1-2 weeks towards launch they’ll start marketing a bit more.
---
I always give spare mats to people leveling enchanting giving away free ones 
---
I’ve always got some spare vision dust and stuff like that so I just roll up and drop it on them. 
---
I also charge 0 fees for any enchant, tip what you’d like unless you’re not 60 or in my guild then I will refuse tips. 
---
Makes me feel good
---
Druid. All day. Gameplay is more dynamic in pve. You’re desired in wsg and worthwhile in ab. You can’t die if you know how to play. 
---
You’ll always have a raid spot. And be a rare coveted few on your server. Hunters get worse with age and are a dime a dozen. Level a hunter as your prof. Farming bitch.
---
I was torn between the classes I know and have played semi-extensively (started mid-BC, stopped somewhere during Cata), either Paladin, Mage, or Warlock, so I decided to go outside the box and look at one of the classes I never really tried. Probably won't be raiding (I just can't commit the time), so I'd like to enjoy the leveling experience, first and foremost - actually read quest text, work on professions as I level, stuff like that. I was also thinking about taking PvP somewhat seriously at 60, since I only ever messed with it casually, but I'd still like to do 5-mans and grinding junk. I guess I'd just like to hear recommendations from people on what they think would be more fun.
---
Priest - I don't think I ever got a Priest past level 10 when I was still playing, and I've tried healing in other MMOs and kinda liked it, so I wouldn't mind giving it a shot in WoW. The lack of mobility options seems like it would suck for leveling, though, and that's something I really enjoy in classes. The idea of constantly respeccing when I want to heal in dungeons and then go Shadow for PvP or grinding seems like a massive pain, as well. I'd prefer to be able to just jump between stuff at endgame as I feel like it. Part of me feels like, if I was going to play a caster, I'd rather just go back to Mage since there's stuff about that class that I know love (lots of control and mobility, big AoEs, portals, food and water, Blinking everywhere).
---
Druid - I really like the versatility as a chronic alt-aholic and somewhat that likes variety in gameplay. The idea of throwing out DoTs as a caster, then shifting to Bear or sneaking around as a Cat to finish guys off, then popping back out to heal while leveling seems like a lot of fun. The mobility with Cat and Travel forms seems great, as well, plus being able to heal and tank, if I felt like it. Honestly, the biggest turn-off for me is the idea of spending a bunch of time as an animal and not seeing my gear, and I do tend to prefer casters, so Boomkin being useless kinda sucks for me.
---
Hunter - The class I was most considering. Great solo-ability for the leveling experience, solid CC and damage for dungeons, good in PvP, and I'm kinda into the Pokemon-ish aspects of collecting rare pets. I do generally play casters, as well, so the idea of experiencing some of the gameplay stuff I never saw before - getting a new armor type at 40, actually using a weapon that's not a wand - sounds pretty enticing. Again, though, if I was going to play a pure ranged damage class, part of me feels like just going back to Mage, since I like having all sorts of utility spells.
---
So yeah, I was kinda leaning towards maining a Hunter with a Priest alt for healing if I felt like. Or I dunno, maybe I'll just make a mage.
---
Lol I run around noob zones with lvl 1 boots with speed enchants and hand them out. The hype is real
---
Female human (healers) from my experience 
---
Female human rogues and warriors are badass but not usually the most charitable
---
Is beserking really worth losing +5 wep skill and a 25% ap active self buff?  Berserking probably does just about beat that out, but not by much imo, and you lose a hell of a lot of nice, more pvp orientated, racials for it.
---
I enjoyed tanking as a tauren warrior, and pvp as a troll shaman, but I started in early BC.
---
* Is there a good reason to roll either as a different race?
---
* Can my shaman be effective in pvp without raid-level gear?
---
* How much time in hours would I be spending grinding gold for spec changes?
---
Play what you think will be enjoyable. My friends and I plan on making a guild and always liked the idea of the 'non meta' specs. If we are willing to have these I'm sure other people will as well. In Classic there is always room for any spec.
---
If they release some kind of revision of Vanilla with more shit that’s fine. IF... they keep Classic untouched, and it’s years down the road, after we get BC and Wrath.
---
I thank you for the response. Many of my friends have told me that the person controlling the tank matters more than the class.And that holds true to your comment as well.
---
Each to their own but personally I'd put up with animations I didn't like that much for the stun resist alone.  Also warstomp is garbage for warriors.
---
Thank you!
---
Slightly related question: is raid healing hard in vanilla? I’m planning on being mostly casual, and I’m interested in raid healing.
---
I have a second monitor and it's all over there for me.
---
the health boost isn't really worth it m8.
---
I'm not sure I dont min/max. I'm going to play what looks best imo. Generally I play Orc, but if they cant stand up straight I will probably end up something else.
---
That amount of paper.. probably .02% of a tree
---
Good news is 10 Trees were planted in its place so no worries.
---
That’s disappointing but I guess makes sense. Thanks for the info!
---
If its just between the two, flip a coin and let fate decide.
---
I’ve mained Druid since vanilla. I got in the habit of keeping travel form on 1 and that’s the only one I would truly bind simply because if I needed to kite that’s the form I’m going to use. If I needed to shapeshift anything else I would just click
---
I doubt it, I think classic is more about them getting people to resubscribe to have more steady income flow.
---
Just remember that this is more than likely with 0 other people around you fighting for the same mobs. So under perfect conditions you can get out of the starting zone in 32 minutes, at launch, it's going to take longer because there is no mob tag sharing like in retail. so be prepared for that. At least you found an optimal route so you aren't wasting time running back and forth to multiple places. That's one thing you have over the others. 
---
I've been doing the same thing for my Dwarf Priest, got it to 30 minutes as well.
---
I will 100% be making a female orc shaman level 39 twink as soon as possible (hopefully with pendulum).
---
Personally not a huge fan of the 19 twink scene, too melee dominated imo.  the 29 and 39 and even 49 scene was a lot better IMO back in the day.
---
Tauren and Dwarves are great, but Night Elves and Trolls also have a very high "friendly skill ceiling" &lt;3
---
Nope nobody else is
---
39 with pendulum.... if you can get it :P
---
Ok I responded to the other guy - I'll just respond here. A PROPERLY played Holy Paladin is an absolute monster.  
---
First thing - before the fight, check your aura. Multiple adds? Consider Retribution Aura to assist with the tank holding aggro. They hit too hard? Ok, keep the standard Devotion Aura. Maybe the tank can't hold aggro and you're pulling healer aggro, but they hit fast and you can't heal? Concentration Aura.  
---
Second thing. Fight starts out - run up with the melee and judge the target. Depending on your group composition, pick out which judgements work best for your group. (Light for melee groups so they heal themselves, Wisdom for caster heavy groups so they regen mana).  
---
Stay in close, about 15 yds from the target, in-between your casters and melee. In this way, if a mob breaks free from your targets, you're the first to CC it before it reaches your casters - nail that sucker with a long, 6 second stun! If your caster still holds aggro, hit them with a BoP (Blessing of Protection) which gives the tank even MORE time to taunt them back, or kill the mob, CC etc.  
---
Spam FoL down-ranked, or maybe even get a few auto-attacks in to regen your mana between heals (using your own judgement of Wisdom). Watch out for your kiting classes, and get ready with a Blessing of Freedom if they get slowed!  
---
Yeah... there's a LOT of things a Holy Pally can do, but you have to hunt down and seek out every possible opportunity to utilize every tool at your disposal. Be quick to cleanse EVERYTHING and always watch your rebuffs! It's engaging, constant, and you literally impact every part of the gameplay around you. You'll become aware of things you never knew existed between class dynamics, and you'll be the master of your environment.  
---
Or, do what 90% of vanilla pallies did, and spam Holy Light until oom, then use LoH, then spin in a circle and watch everyone die. (Side note: later ranks of LoH should be used on yourself as a mana regen, if needed).
---
Ah true, good pickup.
---
The xp gain from PVP wasn't added until well into TBC (or was it WotLK). At no point in Vanilla was there xp gain from PVP so I don't see why they'd put it in classic.
---
Since you're going warrior I say orc. Cow men are fine, but you could be a bloodthirsty savage orc warrior. 
---
Also I think male Tauren have stupid two handed swing animations but that might not be a problem
---
I managed to get my horde vanilla/tbc leveling down to the point where I could completely skip STV because of this. Random world PVP while leveling is one thing...getting camped by level 60s when I'm level 32 and trying to relax and kill some tigers ain't cool yo.
---
If one class fantasy/play style screams for you to play it, follow your heart, but if you are having trouble deciding, I think I'd axe out a few classes for a newbie.  
---
Warrior-Most gear dependent, leveling can be a slog, most vulnerable in 1v1 world pvp, farming is more complicated and you have heavy repairs, most pressure to know what you are doing/lead when tanking dungeons (although if you want to tank, you should pick warrior)  
---
Druid-Look, I know Druid is viable and everything, but it is the weakest class in vanilla, so if your a newbie and the class fantasy isn't screaming for you to play it, why not pick something stronger? You have no real niche in AV/AB, and your niche in WSG of being a flag carrier is very specific, and while fun, might be better for someone more experienced/might limit the ability of your BG experience to vary.  
---
Paladin-I know some people like paladin, but it is the class that the largest % of people find incredibly boring. If you picked pally and didn't like the game, I'd worry there's an increased probability it's just that you don't like the stale/easy-to-play Pally experience, and judge Vanilla incorrectly.
---
Again, play what you want, BUT if you are new and having trouble deciding, to narrow things down a bit, I'd advise looking a bit more into Mage/Priest/Warlock/Rogue/Hunter/Shaman.
---
Lemme try answering your first statement first: for a casual alt melee class, rogue is probably not the answer for you. Ret Pally as an alt can actually be pretty fun, and if you're not worried about gearing your alt, that's a perfect class for it, since you can just bubblehearth out of trouble at will. Warriors... as an alt, meh. They require quite a bit of time/gear to build up into something fun.  
---
As for Lock vs. Mage, I mained a mage for a long time, and it was a blast. Locks in Vanilla were quite a bit more powerful, but oddly enough, Mages are better in PvP. If you want utility, it depends on what you want to bring - there's a lot to consider there, tbh, but I don't think you can go wrong with either choice. For a casual player, though, I would probably recommend the mage over the lock. Mostly because mages have a simpler rotation, and require fewer keybinds than locks do.
---
Yeah I've done zero research other than casually decide which class to play. Hoping it will all be fresh for me and I can just derp around without worrying about all these plans
---
US Whisperwind &lt;SCARAB&gt;
---
US Whisperwind &lt;Exalted&gt;
---
US Stormreaver &lt;Out of Line&gt;
---
I hope you're all doing well out there wherever you are
---
&lt;Aurora&gt; on Arthas, US Horde. Resto Druid. Probably will roll the same thing.
---
You basically heal yourself, whilst rabid autists spam stuns and other toxic shit on you. Your “teammates” complain that you’re the reason they died/flag was dropped/node was tapped/their gf left them/lost their job.
---
see \*Hasn't logged online in 10y\* is the real beginning of depression
---
Orb of Deception. I think I found it in Winterspring? IIRC sold it for 800-1000g
---
I'm seeing a lot of posts claiming warlocks are played less than mages, so might be easier to find a group with a lock?  
---
But locks also apparently require a lot more keybinds, which is odd, because their rotation in PvE is basically 1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2...??
---
No reason to be like this
---
I think that's the 2nd arc of season 2 of sword Art Online
---
If you are getting beat by 30% is that viable?
---
If you cared to check youd see healing is also on there.
---
For NE, I've managed about 52mins to hit L6, but L10 usually takes me about 3 hours. Your time to level 5 sounds slightly better than being on par with my best attempts so no surprise there, but the time to L10 being only 1hr 20mins? When you were on par for a ~45-50 min L6? Grats if it's true, I just have my (well justified) doubts for now.
---
I got rank 10 on my Rogue, I don't remember being that hardcore on it - though it was a long time ago, when I was a kid.
---
Since when were there only 2 horde races?
---
/signed
---
Same. Mage has been my main since tbc till dh. This time around I really wanna roll lock.... But then there's also mage.... And I think I want a holy pally. So if I go ally prob gunna go mage? I'm not sure. Ugh
---
Then you might remember the guildmaster Roguepaladin xD
---
Oh yeah, resources aren’t personally instanced anymore.
---
If I wasn't emotionally attached to the mage class I would play a warlock in classic.  They are nowhere near as overplayed as mages but are strong in solo, PvP, dungeons, and raids.
---
If classic BC happens, attachment or not I will go warlock.
---
Helping with class quests is Sainthood material.  Double if it is opposite faction after you tag the mob.
---
Remember to jump-shot him as you're running back over the bridge into his room for extra style points ;)
---
Classic WoW*
---
It's just so hard for any guild to justify bringing a prot paladin. They're not necessary for any content at all and they can't tank at least half of the game's bosses due to the lack of a taunt, so there's already a problem here with giving a tank spot to a paladin. Then comes the gearing issue--paladin sets don't have tank stats so they have to gear up entirely with off-set pieces and will need to have priority over warriors for these if you want the paladin to ever be even remotely well-geared. This interferes with main tank gearing. If you don't do that, the paladin will fall behind in gear really quickly and would soon be unable to tank content even if the class itself technically could. It's just a lot simpler with warrior tanks because their sets are itemized for tanking so the second, third and fourth tank can be geared up without constantly competing with the first tank like a paladin will.
---
If they release too close to sep I'll be too busy with my daughter living with me and going to kindergarten.
---
If they release in July I'll have time before she moves in with me
---
"hasn't logged on in 10 years"
---
That shit hurt me.  So many friends gone to the nether.  You are all missed.
---
During wotlk enhance was solid and a lot of fun with maelstrom. I don't remember what patch but I do know I went into icc as enh and held my own.
---
It's harder than dpsing, easier than tanking
---
Right now I am just hoping we get all 4 types of servers to choose from. My groups tentative plan so far is to roll on an RPPVP server. Will be kinda bummed if it turns out PVP and Normal are the only options.
---
*Chases you down to buff you*
---
*Has a picture of a gauntleted fist with spikes.*
---
I don't think that's what buffing means...
---
Most raids I know had at least 1/2 druids. One feral for Leader of the Pack/Innervate/Battle rez, and one Resto for raid HoTs/Innervate/Battle rez/Imp MoW. I know one comp I ran with for awhile used a Boomkin for w/e aura they had, Innervate/Battle Rez. But no more than 3/4 druids per raid, otherwise you simply felt nerfed.  
---
And apparently the pserver community hates druids, so gl overcoming their prejudice come Classic release. =/  
---
At any rate, you play a druid to do everything that goes un-noticed, but keeps the main DPS spamming "1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2 - LoOk I'm ToP dPs YoU sCrUbS!$!23!$!"
---
For like, AV? Resto spec makes for a good shammy. For more one on one situations, frost shock kites vs melee... Rest is pretty self-explanatory... Fear totem vs locks etc.
---
Rogues are only good with cooldowns and get ass raped when they are being targeted by more than one enemy without cooldowns. Mages still have polymorph, blink, nova, coc, etc to get away even if ice block is off cd
---
Back in Vanilla healing dungeons was my jam. Loved it. I remember have some amazing Druid and pally tanks that were way easier to heal. 
---
Yes, I had to heal them more which usually resulted in slower pulls due to drinking. But I usually had fewer agro issues on bigger pulls which was usually the biggest danger. Dps could always help peel one or two mobs slipping, and I had my CDs but the instant the warrior lost agro on an aoe pull people started dieing. Unfortunately the wait for agro to build before you engage doesn’t apply to healers. If a tank needs a heal you have to heal.   
---
90% of the time I have no problem with a pally tank as long as he has the gear for the encounter.   Not much I can do about you getting two shot though. Warriors just have more forgiveness in getting to Def cap and mitigating big damage, especially early in before everyone is geared to the tits.
---
Doesn't the Grounding totem break stun/sap/seduce/poly effects too? While slowing opponents?
---
Dwarf priests have a 3 min racial fear protection buff (works once, is on a 3 min CD)
---
Ya. Then you get to spam fireball instead of frostbolt! Way more fun
---
I want to play mage since I’ve only ever played mage and the latter 6 months of vanilla was when I started a mage.  
---
But I also want to not spend hours forming a group.  I’ve also wanted to dabble with healing.  So I may give priest a go.
---
Paladins? We never take any of them. We're horde :P
---
A couple moonkins, sure we'll take them. Problem would be though actually finding anyone that plays a boomchicken. Hehe.
---
Hmm if only there was this system that expressed peoples like or dislike of something, buuuut that doesn't exist so I guess we'll just go off the whims of your dumb ass.
---
If that was the case we'd still be in cataclysm
---
Thats not how Activision works though.
---
I hope they take as long as they need but we will see.
---
I've leveled a few rogues recently to about 20-30 on pservers just to check a few thing out to get ready. Done skinning/mining on them. All skills bought except expose armor and they have about 6-15g on them. Main good thing i see is early on extra silver for the 8-10 slot vendor bags.
---
Are you trying to say Warcraft II was pixar-cartoony?  Bright, colorful, and cute doesn't necesarily mean it can't be serious, but I was specifically talking about WoW, not the Warcraft RTS games. 
---
Also I've played WC2 a fair bit, so I wouldn't exactly call this an introduction.
---
Berserk is weak in pvp, still better than fury, which kills you. Pet damage is garbage, however, nice while leveling. Most classes don't have a stun resist talent, so it'll just be a 1 in 4 chance, which is unreliable. The axe skill does nothing in pvp. Yes, the warrior might not care as much about wotf, but it's huge for other classes. Orcs make ok warriors, pretty good dps, but you wont always have a good axe, especially in raid, and the rest of the racials they have are a bit lame in comparison to others.
---
I was that guy for a long time back when ton of new folks were still starting. I would often do nothing for hours but help newbies. Got a lot of satisfaction out of that.
---
Cool! ...I mean the shield, not the missing healing plate gear. That would be superb
---
I would rather have a mage in my group than a rogue most of the time
---
Thx, that is comletely different position than I am. That’s why I’m not doing these preps, but it works for you :)
---
You wouldn't happen to have all of this in Google docs would you???
---
Binder Andy over here lol
---
tbh more shaman are wanted as healers than the number of people who play the class, relative to priests.
---
I liked your take. I'm not 100% on passing on it, but it's personal preference. I'd tend to agree with you honestly because HOTW isn't really the FC spec anyway, which you really want resto. HOTW is a great hybrid spec and I ran 0/30/21 back in the day and liked it a lot. I debated between that and the typical pure feral spec. The instant heal and more powerful HoT was hard to pass up in PvP. Never tried JUST healing with it though
---
2 or 3 should do the trick
---
tauren druid are great.
---
That's a funny way to spell.. wait no, you spelled it right.
---
Holy shit dude. I'd pay multiple dollars for that.
---
Alliance has two magic dispelling classes so organized pvp can be more annoying. I'd still never play alliance warlock, though.
---
I'll just take whatever shitty int plate I can get, and pop on the +healing min/max stuff when only my guild can laugh at me. Can't wear that shit in public ya know
---
I wasn't in classic, but in wotlk I would give away potions to low level guys while leveling alchemy. all because some dude came around and gave me his excess potions when i was a low level
---
DWARVES, NOT DWARVES
---
That's hilarious actually.
---
I went out of my way to do it early cuse I wanted the xp from the quest chain
---
Orc vs troll beserk is mostly even in dps but the orc one also debuffs you with mortal strike. +5 to axes is nice but the best weapons are swords so it won't be used much. And some bosses have stun moves that can't be resisted so orc really doesn't have any benefit over troll in PVE.
---
Once you factor in pvp then orc starts to even out or beat troll depending on how much you pvp.
---
Mage vs. Rogue is skill based, but mages have a significant advantage. I don't know how many times I've been jumped by a rogue, poly'd him, then reset the fight in order to simply destroy him. \*yawn\*  
---
Mage vs. Hunters is where it gets a little difficult - most hunters can really hurt mages, unless they let them get in close. Even then, their pets interrupt spellcasting and wreck their HP. It's basically a DPS race and mages can't use anything other than instant casts.  
---
Mage vs. Shamans is frustrating. Enh Shamans usually win this one, unless the mage gets some lucky bursts in. But purge/shock/totems... it's super tough to beat, and you can't kite them. Resto... depends, but usually you can beat 'em, even if they purge everything  
---
Mage vs. Paladin = burst till bubble, if they don't hearth, wait... wait... ok burst till they die.  
---
Mage vs. Holy Priest - see Paladin notes minus bubble  
---
Mage vs. Shadow Priest... mana war - really it's a matter of survival. CS early, try not to die, hope they keep dispelling stuff or switch out of shadowform to heal. Otherwise SPriest wins.  
---
Mage vs. Warriors... lol. Warriors. They die so easy.  
---
Mage vs. Warlock - they might get a win or two, mostly an even fight, but mages typically win if played right. \~51% of the time...  
---
There are no "tricks" to spec'ing a mage - all of them work, depending on your playstyle. I can't speak for rogues, never played one, just know I love killing them. Always killing them. They are so vindictive, it's fun to bait them into attacking you, just to kill them.
---
This man gets it.
---
OH man I agree dude I swear this sub has my anticipation through the roof
---
It redirects spells cast at you towards the totem, so I don't think it's really accurate to say it breaks/dispells anything. If you're already under the effect of a spell it doesn't do anything. It doesn't slow.
---
Freezing Band. I sold it to a ranker Mage for 900g.
---
Who knows, maybe check one of the 30 other threads asking this exact same question.
---
Horde or alliance?! I met a lot of cool Aussies on SB.
---
that last pic got me kinda down qq
---
This is so me in vanilla. I can prove it! I play Tauren
---
IMO, humans weren't good until TBC, when they got their trinket thingy.  
---
Up until then, dward priests/warriors/rogues were better in most ways simply because of the priests 3 min fear ward and stone form. But that's my preference.
---
So was Rexxar. He was the only Mok'Nathal in all of Warcraft in WC3. Didn't stop them from expanding on it and introducing more half ogres when we went to Outland.
---
Then it becomes subjective, what if someone neglects their gear more because they power level or know they can just need roll greens that would have been shared out otherwise. What about certain items that clearly were intended for 1 class but another class can give a half sincere justification while they hover over the need button. Can a hunter roll for Jordan? Helps mend pet, spirit goes a long way, hard to find good int items, and buffs his serpent sting which is the hunter's bread and butter, also buffs arcane shot. Infact spell power is literally one of the best stats for a hunter while leveling. I dare you to find a lvl 35 melee weapon with more than 10 or 12 agi, do those add the same value a Jordan would, probably impossible.
---
You were supposed to defeat the huntards not join them.
---
Keep in mind that Classic was originally requested as a "legacy server option" -- not something that is typically marketed, as a new release or expansion would be.  Once Classic is live, I think we can count on the still significant Blizzard fan base to notice a new game option.
---
I love these kinds of people
---
It's procs. And defensive CDs.
---
Seals and Judgement are pretty cool, but mostly if you're not in a raid so can take debuff slots. You can pick up Consecration to fill some extra time, but still is a little empty.
---
That said, I sadly can't main a Ret Pally in Classic purely because it's... not great... in PvE. Enh Shaman just feels way better (and that still probably won't be my main). I started in early TBC and Ret Pally was my first real main. Through Legion it was my primary main (some phases as others).
---
If they do TBC, between the general Paladin improvements (having a taunt) and Ret getting Crusader Strike, it will be my main.
---
Ele/Resto: Staying on top of dispels, recognizing when there's an opportunity to get a kill and when there is none so you don't waste a bunch of time casting, being able to use your totems properly.
---
Ele/Resto isn't rocket science because it's really just divided between healing, dispelling, dropping totems and interrupts. It's just that it has an ass ton of buttons to press.
---
If you wanna be a offtank in raids, my friends and I are making a guild and would have no problem with you being a paladin tank :)
---
You just gotta find the right guild and mindset of players, realising a “meme” spec might take a bit more searching.
---
Anything is viable if you can clear the raid with it
---
I don't really know but I'd guess it'd be something around 15g at lvl 40 and 70g at lvl 60, probably a fair bit more if you purposely grind basilisks/gorillas/whelps for a few levels here and there. It's just a very easy thing to do that costs very little effort/time but gives you a nice little bonus towards mount/skills.  
---
Because it's so popular all types of leather become incredibly cheap on the AH, typically only 15% or so higher than vendor price after you take out AH fee. That's why people just vendor it.
---
The hunter did nothing wrong!
---
Hey, that's my thread :)
---
Our guild is the same mindset as yours, and I find it’s common with the older crowd of returning vets..(30-40yr olds haha)
---
Ok, I know the pserver crowd will say otherwise, but most people who played warriors in my experience during vanilla would park the toon in a major city until/if going somewhere to run instances or tank.  
---
World PvP, they just got rocked. Meet a shaman? Dead. Druid? Dead. Paladin? Dead. Mage? Dead. Priest? Dead. Hunter? probably dead. Rogue? ...probably dead. Warlock? ...probably dead. Spend 50g to respec from tank to MS twice every week just to avoid being ganked non-stop? ...10 HOURS of farming just to do that?? AND farm for pots/flasks? AND farm for food buffs? AND farm for repair bills... yeah, I don't think so...  
---
This is why most warrior tanks had viable max level alts.
---
not true! you also mix in a couple scorch's and fireblasts!!!!  all kidding aside it is really fun to raid aq &amp; naxx on a fire mage.  between pyro pulls/blast wave/ignites you can really torch the other dps.
---
Biggest oof gave me 2007 vanilla memories.
---
Nexus stone? What expansion did that come from
---
We had a boomkin for fun in guild and gave him tons of gear.  He started near top of meter but any fight &gt; 3 mins he was oom with all cds used.

---
I personally think Disc usually gets ignored because it's hard for most damage meters to quantify the actual amount of damage mitigation a shield does.  
---
The only way to really tell is to gauge it's use in a raid - and most theorycrafters don't actually do that. Back in my WoTLK days I used to know some very serious raiders who would compile an entire raid's logs, though, and during that particular expansion, Disc priests were WAY stronger, but still ignored because "oooo pretty numbers!"  
---
Can't really say for vanilla, but like most, I knew a couple disc priests, that, when they were along, somehow the raids just went smoother for some reason...   
---
Also they could be unkillable in PvP unless you had someone along to dispell/purge them.
---
Youd be suprised.
---

Do you happen to have the macro that power shifts you from same form to same form (to beak roots)? Or have a link to the macro, I’ve been looking for one and can’t find it. :(
---
Im gonna stab so many fucking people with my rogue
---
Ahh. Goddamn this hits.
---
Bullzer! Get your ass on that tauren shammy while i tank a bitch!
---
Not for mana. Just health regen.
---
Thanks for making a pointed and cogent reply.
---
Playing WoW is literally a tradtion though, so I'm making appeals to tradition to a tradition. 
---
You are yourself appealing to tradition. The reason your argument is bad in my eyes is because they only did this with the phat loot items. As a warrior, did you seriously need roll a 3/3 ring of the owl while running SFK? Fuck no, that would be a dick move, that ring is close in quality to BOP blue items, can be sold for an equal value upgrade for your class. It fits ALL criteria you list for equal exchange value, yet nobody I ever saw did this or spoke of it. Because people didn't need roll other class's greens and say "I get equal value when i sell this". I am also willing to bet that if someone did the same to you, you wouldn't be happy.
---
So applying your standard to only high cost items is the contradiction that refutes any claim to be doing it based on principle.
---
You also might open yourself up to all kinds of silliness, like WHO benefits from upgrades the most if value is how you derive entitlement. If value is your metric, BoP loot should be given to mages warriors rogues and priests first.
---
I think commitment is my principle, everyone commits equally and weighs the risks of suboptimal loot dropping that they agree to pass to the correct classes. If the group farms a lottery winning item, you just so happen to be a mage when a staff dropped, what rotten luck for the other guy who saw gauntlets drop on his priest, and a gun drop on his shaman. My preferred method helps the player base fight off bad RNG by letting the rogue take the gun and trade it for his devilsaur because extremely rare items are just unfair like that. All in all I think a "auction it and split it evenly or winner takes a bigger chunk" is a really fun compromise that many groups could get behind.
---
For a new player, if you are unfamiliar with the WoW lore, I would highly recommend a Shaman. You will get exposed to some of the best stories in the game, albeit solely from the Horde side - and that pains me to say, being that I nearly always play Alliance.  
---
If you know the lore, then I would say go Dwarf Priest. There's a lot of stories in Vanilla that Dwarves get to play through you probably never heard about, and they're a great endgame class/race to experience.  
---
Either way, best of luck, and welcome to the greatest game ever made!
---
In TBC I had one drop for me while leveling my shaman to twink at 39. It was glorious.
---
I don’t want to prepare.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Everyone wants to DPS. \*eye-roll\*
---
You want that Eye of Sulfuras!
---
rickmoranis on Magtheridon helped me and my 3 brothers soooo much when we first started out. if he sees this it would make me so happy to just tell him thanks again. way back in vanilla
---
I can't decide between priest and shaman. I'm a support player at heart and I love healing, but I don't mind doing dps every now and then for pvp or dungeons.
---
A big concern I have is gold farming while in my raid spec. As a priest I can spec holy nova and farm dire maul lashers while still being in a decent healing spec, but I'm not sure what I could do as a shaman.
---
Bbqsaucepwn.

---
Bruh, someone paid $15 for their sub, and then $20 for YOUR sub. Blizzard made an extra $5.
---
Specially those spirit enchants will be huge buff to your levelling speeds, no matter what class you play.
---
More Spirit, faster regeneration and less time drinking/eating.
---
Well, for one thing a lot of us actually like the old class balance model. Not every spec could do everything, and that was okay.
---
That said, I've always thought it would be fun to explore the possible impact tier sets with set bonuses geared toward some of those off specs. This would have to be much later down the road and probably limited to a fun PTR, but it would be interesting to see how much we can boost vanilla hybrids for example without having to resort to physically nerfing and homogenizing them. That's how we got the hot mess that is retail class balance, stripped of flavor and uniqueness and basically just the same 4 roles over and over with different visual effects purely for the sake of the DPS meters.
---
Can confirm - also pretty much the only class that can get away with this. Some will try to argue it, but if you really want to min/max for raids you'll end up with a non-viable PvP spec with pretty much any other class.
---
What’s wrong with that?
---
Spend my time making a group and getting it all running, I’m not going to waste my time and everyone else’s because you wanted to be a silly fool.
---
Average person? Maybe 50-60g through your levelling experience.  If you purposely grind mobs that drop greys and you can skin them for exp instead of questing (this would be slower) then you could probably hit 60 with 200-250g... keep in mind some of this would HAVE to be spent on some upgrades off AH if you chose this route.
---
&gt;!Tirion, assuming i found the right guy.!&lt;
---
This is me except for Tauren/orc shaman
---
Up-voted, but I think you meant Horde locks are annoying due to Wotf?
---
Those crits for mana refunds were fun to see with scrolling combat text.
---
Almost makes me want to roll CleanseBot-Class again.
---
Oh but have you not heard? It was my understanding that everyone has heard...

Trolls are just tauren who spec'd into tusks instead of horns.

The GM of my first MC/BWL/AQ40/PVP guild was a Thundfury wielding ball of rage and blades named Gnomerccy that was hilarious to watch tanking a dragon the size of two school buses.

---
your third bullet was about investment into that tradeskill = they earned the right to keep mats. Listen don't ego identify with the argument I get it was a hypothetical. Enchanters were excluded so that wasn't the case.
---
bullet #4. So knowing the market and being able to get slightly more gold applies to Staff of Jordan also, why bring it up as a justification if you aren't willing to accept that justification? (I am making an assumption here that AH sharks don't deserve literally all epic BOE drops).
---
I kinda hope there's a way to activate it. I never played Legion or BFA but I thought the action cam looked interesting and wanted to try it out sometime.
---
Haha great to see more of us out here! I’m definitely rolling on Suramar if they keep the old server names.
---
I leveled in vanilla as destro. So I cannot speak on Affl really. I used trusty blueberry and a standard destro rotation... and it took about 2 months averaging 12 hours a day. Efficient I was not, but fun it was. :) 
---
Do some reddit, web, or YouTube searches. People have been pumping out classic info for a while. Guarentee some lock focused classic guide has your answers.
---
i hope they do, it would be so cool to jump into old server name and recognize people.
---
How would they know?
---
There's a tick on the 5th second, then every 2 seconds after that. So you can wait 2.1 seconds in between cast with a 3 second cast spell and get 1 tick of regen and am effective cast time of 5.1 seconds
---
I'll be more clear. Alliance warlocks are annoying to play in 1v1 due to wotf. In organized pvp the horde only has one defensive magic dispel while alliance has two, making organized pvp slightly more annoying for horde. The 1v1 weakness is such a negative factor to me that I wouldn't play an alliance warlock, which sucks because they're higher dps in pve than horde due to blessings.
---
GNOMES RISE UP!
---
I played that poormans twink recently in live to do a couple WSGs. Of course I had to keep the name #nochanges
---
My friendly guy traded naked pictures of himself in real life for gold to some random lady and gave it to me to go towards my epic flying mount. Dude was a real MVP.
---
Not kidding.
---
Honestly I'm only hoping it's before my school starts just because my buddy will be coming to visit so we can sesh together like the good ol days. I'll take a day off school to play the first day, that's fine. I just don't want to be in classes half the day if he's out here...
---
First, faction. Horde is easiest overall, and also most played, so again, easier to find groups, raids etc.  
---
Second, race. Trolls are by far the most fun, easygoing race, and are the coolest looking Horde-side race. Also their racial is pretty badass if used correctly.  
---
Finally, class. Ready for this? Shaman. BY FAR the most fun. Someone kitting you? HAH! Frostshock/Ghostwolf! Gotta run away? GROUNDING TOTEM/Ghostwolf! Buddy needs a heal? TOTEM! Mage went OOM (again) TOTEM! Need an interrupt? BAM! EARTHSHOCK! Wanna heal the whole group at the same time!? BAM! CHAINHEAL!  
---
Shamans are stupid fun. You can purge. You can break stealth players. You can run away. You can chase people down. You'll always get invited to groups. You HAVE TOTEMS!  
---
I mean, I play Alliance, and I HATE Shamans. If I played Horde, I would ABSOLUTELY, hands down, positively play a Troll Shaman. They're nuts in PvE, and fun in PvP. 100%, the very most fun you can possibly have in Vanilla WoW.  
---
Oh, and don't forget Ankh. No need for a graveyard run... =D
---
I think if you do 50-60 on only skinnable beasts you get an epic mount 100% guaranteed.
---
It's all slapped together word documents I've copy pasta'd together from multiple guides and sources. Each section is basically it's own word document. If I have free time over the next week or 2 I'll compile it into a Google docs. No promises tho.
---
Isn't the in combat regen only 5hp per second?
---
I'm truly expecting an announcement for the release date in mid-late May.
---
i was on thunderhorn alliance, i remember a few guilds &lt;lobster brood&gt; &lt;art of aggression&gt; for horde and &lt;imminent&gt;, &lt;god’s of war&gt;, &lt;reborn&gt;, &lt;prophets of the alliance&gt; for alliance
---
Unlikely they will replicate them due to not knowing how many servers they will need.
---
Its possible they announce a list beforehand though, and the community could try to coordinate that themselves.
---
You seen plate repair bills? Ya boi cant afford charity
---
The two problems with paladin tanks in Vanilla are a lack of a taunt and going OOM.
---
If the fights don't have a complete threat drop then the taunt usually isn't too much of an issue, and if the fights are short enough, going OOM won't be too much of a problem as you'll have a good threat lead on people usually.
---
Going for raids or encounters that make this an issue is very troublesome for the long term viability of prot pally in Vanilla.
---
But if you want to mess with people in PVP going engineering and a prot/ret with Force Reactive Disk (MC pattern for engineering), Reckoning, and stun grenades for Seal of Command fun.... you can mess with people and hold flags.
---
Definitely not within the normal lifespan of Classic. Post-naxx anything can happen.
---
They've been abundantly clear that they're not trying to mix up the formula.
---
I have a wall of windows right behind my computer desk. It's great. The two blinds behind the monitor need to be closed during the day, but that's not bad.
---
That's actually a good point - especialy given that rogues are the anti-warlock, having that stun resist is a godsend.
---
What?
---
Vendetta on Kael'Thas
---
Gotta fill dem 40 slots somehow
---
I would check out Zzi, phones about to die or else I’d link video. He played on a older Pserver. Pretty entertaining and good skill.
---
Do Hpallies use nothing but raiding gear in pvp?
---
My biggest thing is that I realize that I will never probably tank in raids, nor will I have the time for it. I enjoy 5 man's and see that as my main tanking ssoect in classic wow. If I do find the time to raid, yes I will most likely heal and I respect that. But in terms of tanking, ,I don't expect to be main tanking raids.
---
Any spec is viable in dungeons period.
---
Sorry I don't remember it. Honestly, it's possible that the instant power shift part didn't work until they updated the macro system sometime in TBC. It may work on classic when it launches though, depending on what macro system they use. But if you're looking for a working macro for a vanilla private server right now I'm unable to help you.
---
Interesting. Is it worth watching?
---
it's more so to weed out bad responses and to make sure that there's a ratio close to 50/50 to make sure its an okay sample to represent the population
---
Hard to say. There might be a risk of encouraging overpopulation on ‘famous’ servers.
---
I hope you're not planning on rolling a ret Pally then because they barely press any buttons, lol
---
That aside, if someone is willing to put in the extra time and effort to make an off spec work then the grand majority of guilds will take them. My old Vanilla guild had a ret Pally, feral druid (OT) and shadow priest who were all exceptional and 110% earned their spot on our raid roster. It's not impossible by any means for certain "bad" specs. Granted, we never cleared AQ40 but we were able to get to C'thun before TBC hit and our lack of further progression was in no way tied to them. There will obviously be certain specs that will have an impossible hill to climb no matter ones dedication; Lazerchicken, ele shammy and prot Pally immediately come to mind, but not all of them are completely irrelevant
---
will do give me till the end of the semester

Gnomes rise up! *to about knee level

Blood Elf females have the best casting animations but I guess we are only talking about vanilla in which case you're correct.
---
Damn dark runes. I grew to hate Felwood because of those things, lol
---
No because night King was created to fight the first humans. It was a mistake by people of the forest. They realised their mistake and built the wall to keep him trapped behind the wall.
---
This must be a joke, but it’s not even close to funny....
---
Yeah I was looking for a current vanilla Pserver. No worries though, thanks for the reply. GL man!
---
yeah i will pick a sample of 50 out of the x amount of responses to work with using a method called SRS. I will then look at each indiv response and make sure its a valid reply to all the questions and if not I will discard it and pick another response in its place.
---
I have played prot pala a few times and this time around I realize that if I'm only going to level, do dungeons and farm gold for some BoE items. Then I think it's fine. Just enjoying the game as a prot pala without making a big effort of raiding and convincing/proving to people your spec works for X.
---
If a few of my friends decide to play we might decide to roll together so I would go with some other class or just go Holy at 60.
---
Any reason for that date?
---
Seeing how I play outlaw in retail I think fate has had too much to do with me already
---
Wait, the weapon has no level requirement. Cool.
---
I did not think about this I was only thinking about the data I wanted. I believe it's too late now because the new data wont match up with the old. My apologies.
---
Just preference or ninja looted by too many :P I do see the utility the mage brings vs a rogue in a dungeon tho so much more control over multiple enemies.
---
Wrong
---
Well, don’t forget you have Dwarf priests with Fear Ward, which I think will be LOT more common than in vanilla, where most of your priests were human or Elf. Might even be enough of them to frustrate the hell out of Horde thinking they’re going to have an easy time against Alliance
---
I’ll be honest with you that’s really fuckin sad
---
That's just the "pick your fight and no more extras run in" but yes mage does bring a lot more to the table plus conjure food for the grind.
---
Go Orc and make all rogues pee their pants at the sight of you and run away
---
Just wanted to say thank you I was worried I wouldn't get enough responses but I got more than enough. It'll probably take 3 weeks to work with and publish the results.

---
It's not really about the total amount of money you make extra, it's about when you get them, those 5-10s extra really help at level 6 so you can get a couple bags at the vendor in addition to your skills and again at 10 so you can get weapon training.
---
There is a vendor at the dam which sell two different green maces for 13/14

Man, I really never read quest text and I’ve done that quest a million times, this is the first time I’ve read it. I’m not really into RP but this is really cool, thanks for the post.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
I think they meant it’s gonna be a Classic summer for *the devs* because they get to play the closed alpha.
---
You are forgetting to put swirly ball in your rotation.
---
dam that sounds wack
---
I'd much rather they go the OSRS route than simply port in TBC, as I think a lot of the problems that eventually killed the RPG aspect of the game had their root there. I suppose it might be possible to correct for that if you get to it early enough, but I'd rather ounce of prevention than pound of cure.
---
That said, the class/spec design of TBC was absolutely not part of those problems. I'd love to see 'em take inspiration/straight up rip off that side of things, provided the rest doesn't come with it.
---
Last day of class is June 28 :)
---
Not really. When the boss is red to half the group, or your group of fresh 60s is trying to do ubrs, or you’re trying to do a 45min baron run in half blues you can’t just have a shaman tank and a smite priest dps and a melee hunter.
---
I sort of agree, if my faction ganks someone with a mob on them and I’m around to watch I’ll let them fight to the death, if you started it, finish it. But if I see the opposing faction ganking my faction with a mob on them I’ll kill them.
---
Condescension. That'll get 'em.
---
No way would I have that much free silver by level 14. It's mainly the Dun Morogh area I want a good weapon for. Just because I plan on leveling herbalism and killing a lot of beasts for cooking. Come to think of it, I may as well skin everything.
---
it's not about hps as well. Are you really ignorant ?

do you stand up straight when you're drunk ?
---
Yeah those were the popular guilds lol....2 of the guilds I mentioned I made with about 4 friends and random strangers signatures to get enough to start a guild. Graven Embrace was the only one I remember doing any kind of raiding with and even then it was maybe 10 total runs between ZG/AQ20/MC. I just never found a bigger guild to run with. Did a lot of random PVP and instances with my small group of friends. Really want to experience new things this time.
---
Of course, but that doesn’t really matter when a guy for instance steals a truefaith pattern just to sell, gets his mount and has no need for a major gold influx anymore. Damage done to you with no real repercussions unless they keep doing it over and over.

Yeah, this is absurdly important if you're going the skinning route. In the grand scheme of things when you're trying to save 100 gold, your first few gold should be spent buying as big of bags as you can. It will pay for itself when you fill your bags with leather scraps.

I don't know what argument you're making. Pixar-cartoony in what way? If you're saying current WoW is too cartoony, again, the Warcraft games have always been. If you're saying it's not serious enough in tone, I mean, I hate the current wow storyline, but it's plenty serious in terms of "mature" subjects, political drama, ect. If anything, it's gotten *edgyer* in a lot of ways.
---
Who prints things out anymore. It's been a decade probably for me. Just save that stuff in a Google drive folder you can access from a secondary monitor or your phone. Save the trees!

What guild? Me and my friends were on alliance during that time, and we had a pretty dominant guild ourselves.

It really makes me question what Kevin Jordan said about the hybrid tax. The idea of having a hybrid spec do 90 (or was it 95) percent of the damage oc a core class, and the regret that 90 percent made hybrids unwanted in groups and raids.
---
The hybrid tax in vanilla seems more like doing 90 percent less damage, not doing 90 percent of core dps damage.
---
honestly i disagree. male orc casting animations for lock are bad ass
---
Not a rare but I remember how happy I was once I got Ravager for my shaman. Axe looks super good to be low level weapon and effect is just fantastic.

Might be thinking of Every Man for Himself or whatever it was called in Wrath.  The free PvP trinket racial.  They’re definitely not thinking of perception.

You should probably be making more than 10g per hour.

Literally eating the corpse of your enemy is true BM. Add bonus BM points if your healer tops you off and you don't even need the health.
---
It's not, it's like having sports practice and a 6 hour game during the weekends..
---
Is that really the best gear you can get in phase 4?
---
Also does this calculation use mana pots and dark runes on cd? I don't see them mentioned anywhere.
---
Yup. I did the math a bit ago and in BiS tier 3 gear a mage only gains around an extra items worth of intellect from expansive mind. It was something like 0.25% crit. And that's the best circumstance. With regular level 60 gear not too far behind given that mages stat in to spellpower not int.
---
It will make a difference but it's not as game changing as dwarf priest for fear ward versus not. Throw in diplomacy for 10% extra rep - making pvp gear grinds and to a lesser extent zandalar rep easier. And how perception can prevent those pesky meddling rogues from getting the jump on you or escaping. And you even things out a little.

Ultimately if a gnome mage beats you by 1% dps in a raid they deserved it for all the times they got dismounted walking through a puddle.

Back in Vanilla i was a Tauren warrior dps / off-tank for raiding. I seriously can't decide if i want to return to the same thing or switch it up. My alts were rogue and mage which i had so much fun with. My only thing about going warrior again is the sheer amount of warriors. I have a weird thing about wanting to play underplayed classes such as a druid. But overall i value fun over whats good or what their role is. 
---
I may end up just going warrior again, but i'm worried i wont find it fun because its too familiar. So at the moment i'm in a dilemma of not wanting to commit to something i will get bored of.

Horde side, loved all the aussies we had. Thought we were just a normal server with a lot of friends down under until an xpac or two later
---
Priest is a pretty efficient to level, although not the most exciting class, as you mostly just wand stuff to death. You wouldn't have to respec between shadow and holy during leveling, as you can heal dungeons pretty easily even in shadow spec. I think it gets trickier at level 50+ dungeons where you should focus more on holy if you want to heal.
---
But yeah, at level 60, you'd have to respec if you want to be a dps caster in PvE or PvP. In my personal opinion: if you don't like the thought of being a pure healer, picking a healing class as you main is probably not the way to go, as you will lose interest and maybe end up frustated as you can't heal when you're in shadow and you can't shadow when you're heal.
---
I think, for people like you, it's better to main a dps class and have a healing alt for when you have the urge to heal. This is how I did it in TBC and WotLK, maining a mage and have a priest or a pally alt to occasionally log on to, heal some low level dungeons, and then back to my mage.
---
Druid is, in my opinion, very enjoyable to level. It's very diversified, you can stealth around to your quest objective or charge in as a bear. I'm not entirely sure but I think, just like the priest, you can still heal dungeons while leveling, without a resto spec. Since you plan to stay casual at 60, you may get away with some kind of hybrid spec that'll let you heal dungeons. You can go feral/resto or balance/resto, but I don't think you can be *everything* at once, so you maybe have to decide between being a caster that can heal dungeons or being a feral that can heal dungeons. But either way, I think you'll often find yourself healing dungeons as it'll be much easier to find a group that way, and mostly use your caster/feral skills in solo content. I don't know too much about druids though so take this with a grain of salt. Also, keep in mind that horde and alliance druid forms differ from each other, especially the cat form.
---
Hunter is obviously the best leveler, I think you can't go wrong with him when you want to focus on your leveling experience. But I understand that it kinda pushes you back to mage anyway, as I had a similar experience in Retail. I don't know how I can help you here, as it's a pretty tough decision. Both hunter and mage will be good and enjoyable for everything you want to do, as you don't plan on raiding anyway.
---
So, I'm coming to the same conclusion as you: hunter or mage main with a priest alt, while the alternative would be a druid, as long as you're okay with being a healer in dungeons when you reach the higher levels. So it's also a decision between playing one or playing two classes. It sounds like reaching 60 is not your primary goal, so why not double the leveling experience by playing two classes, and then log in whatever you feel like that day.
---
Sorry for the wall of text btw, it got longer than I anticipated.
---
This. You could never spam reincarnation.

Thanks man, great advice.

I am leaning abit to going rogue just because i have heard great things about it and looks like fun.

Yeah I did it all at work. I wouldn't wanna use all that paper and ink if I paid for it lol.

I just found it funnier that he deleted another warlock
---
Seduce is a charm effect, which wotf also gives immunity to, and if you use succubus, you lose the felhunter's spell lock and dispel or the vw's sacrifice.
---
its not really worth the time for leveling. (maybe besides a class quest) but there are no others quests for the dungeon. so its not worth xp wise.
---
[Confused in Holy Paladin]
---
How hard of a sell are druids as tanks and DPS? I want to tank or at least have the option, and run DPS as a backup. I'm not trying to heal on my first roll. Warrior was my original plan, but I really do not want to play a class that is going to be as over populated as warriors will be. 
---
Also, I'm going to be alliance, so can anyone sell me on druid gear on a night elf not being nearly as ugly as I think it is.
---
I think we call that the “Magni’s Hammer”
---
You need to understand what you want, mage and hunters very fun classes in my opinion, both of them required for healthy raid setup, but they are pretty different, mage rotation is pretty simple, Hunter more complicated, aimed timing, pet control.
---
Off specs aren't bad because of gear, an ele or boomkin in even full cloth naxx gear still have issues, it's a fundamental issues with the specs, not gear.
---
Feral actually has access to a lot of pretty nice off piece leather gear, but they don't scale with weapons.
---
Really the only spec that doesn't have viable end game gear is prot pally and to some extent best druid, but pally has so many other issues that you'd be plugging a small hole in swiss cheese.
---
I was a Tauren warrior in vanilla, and i must say i wish i picked Orc at the time. The Tauren racials are quite underwhelming considering what you could have had. Also, getting stuck in doorways because you are too big and not being able to ride most mounts is also annoying.
---
I mean drop tables are the most important thing, so...
---
I really fear that a big streamer picks the same server as my friends and I and clogs up goldshire with all their followers. I don’t understand the whole Twitch thing, but I know it’s gonna take the fun out of a lot of the game if I notice a streamer.
---
I work seasonally and have June, July and August off.
---
Unfortunately I'm going to my sister's wedding in my home country and will be staying there for all of August. I just know Classic will release right as I leave on that trip and then, once I get back, I'm returning straight to work &gt;.&gt;
---
We only ever kited him to beasts room. Never needed to go any further than that.
---
I think the launch was too early. I am glad for the 2nd "marketing push" now that we are closer to the release.
---
Isn’t this the thing so many posts complain about retail? The whole meta-game spreadsheet thing? Idk it’s just confusing to see so many people hate that but then see so many posts of how to meta-game the ever living crap out of classic.
---
If you search "written" it will return all written only guides.
---
Flip a coin and then consider your emotion. If it lands on rogue, if you feel disappointed with the result, then you know your answer.
---
Druids are pretty good off-tanks. Feral DPS is low but leader of the pack is nice for rogue/warrior groups, as long as your guild is casual they'd probably take you.
---
someone just recently enchanted my early +5 str bracers with another 5+ str. have been wearing them for 14 lvl now
---
The last poll showed something like 52/48 A/H.  All the Pservers I’ve seen are about the same.  I believe even retail is a bit more Ally favored in population.
---
I can’t say for 100% though.  Mostly curious where you got that information as well as Horde being easier.  (I never leveled through the classic world as Horde, only Alliance in the past.)
---
Orc animations are nice yeah, but my issue is just with the model.  Mail and plate look way better on orcs but cloth and leather look much better on undead, imo.
---
I played a troll mage from beta into wotlk. Don't ever pick a troll mage
---
1k cuz it’s so true
---
Im not so sure, a lot of people with little classic experience are constantly being reminded that warriors are the only good tank, warriors are the best scaling class, tanking gets you all the gear before everyone...  I bet a lot of people want to tank.
---
Reminded me from the old  "I'M REGENERATING 5 HP AND THERES NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT!" meme
---
"is no different"
---
"BoE cloth item" "BoP cloth item"
---
"no different"
---
"different"
---
I dont think this word means what you think it means.
---
It will all come full circle when jon snow becomes the new night king.
---
&gt; sometimes people are going to break the rules.
---
And that's why it's optimal to utilise a strategy that no one wants to deviate from. In other words, always need. I often said this in the beginning of a dungeon run just so everyone is on the same table.
---
I have yet to see it drop :D
---
I’ll take a few days off probably a week after launch to catch up. 
---
I think Launch day will be tough with so many players.
---
&gt; It was a mistake by people of the forest.
---
And who told Bran that? Yes, the children of the forest. Totally unbiased. They totally have the best for humanity at heart.
---
I never bought the "the night king was a runaway accident" thing.
---
Troll is the more common choice for tank warriors these days, fyi.
---
Id wood comit sudoku.
---
Mage is the scissors to the rogue's paper
---
I found I was hard to kill as a resto shammy. Also AV was great as the dispel, chain heal was good, especially as the fights are close together, like at the bridge at the alliance base or on the ramp up into the horde base. 
---
Never did arenas on my shammy though.
---
There's going to be a lot of wheeling and dealing items early on.  Just offer up to trade random greens you loot and you're sure to find someone interested in trading.
---
In pvp they have lots of interactive abilities, its fun to be very resilient to damage, CC, and all kinds of debuffs.  
---
In PVE... they aren't fun.
---
Op, can you ship a version to me? :)
---
Id say one bear tank in most early content is OPTIMAL, since a druid does more dps than a tank build warrior that doesnt have great dps gear. Maybe later it becomes more even when warriors start using more dps oriented builds and there is enough of dps gear dropped off the raids that they can get some of it.
---
Show next year baby.
---
Don't compare apples to oranges. They're not the same people. People can and will do this in classic. I mean, it's not like vanilla wow was spared from spreadsheets all those years ago, there were just fewer of them due to the relatively new age of the game.
---
I think they are trying to protect it from activision MTX greed by keeping it part of retail in the books.
---
Why ?
---
People want to feel elitist and knowledgeable, and care way too much about the extra 1% clear speed for bringing a better class.
---
At the moment I'm leaning towards this too, yes it will mean being behind at first but I'm not looking to rush the levelling experience anyway. But damn it will be hard to go into work that day after launch xD
---
At launch because *I never learn.*
---
Although the last WoW launch I took vacation on was Legion, and that launch went pretty damn smoothly. 
---
I think taking time off on Classic launch should be fine - the super congested starter zones will be sharded, level 10 is where everyone will start scattering out .
---
Some will start professions, a lot will log off and take a break (assuming they did 1-10 in 1 sitting), some will see 1-10 as a good "experience" for a class and will reroll, some will scatter out and start claiming FPs or move to a new starter zone. I see 1-10 as a very streamlined process, 10+ is where it reeeaally opens up.
---
First of all you picked three specs that isn't intended for their role (although a smite priest paired with a paladin with sanctity aura has many advantages in the undead dungeons). Maybe that's my fault when I actually meant off-meta specs with intended roles.
---
Second, why are you doing a Baron 45 run without all of your Dungeon set?
---
I've said this time and time-again: There is nothing as dangerous in a raid than a bored healer.
---
I take 1 month if the release date come soon
---
In my generel experience, a dedicated druid is better dps than warriors. However it comes with a cheesy play style, immature items and a lot of grinding. Tanking is not something to brag about but the option is there.
---
Personally I would like the raids to have room for all.
---
Undead casting animations are bar none the best in the game
---
As a mage I had the hardest time versus warlocks more than any other class, and will of the forsaken would have been a complete game changer
---
Every troll racial sucks for mage. The active racial is "OK" for pve
---
Robes look terrible on trolls
---
It’s easy to make money with skinning. There was so many “kill 10 mobs”, so skinninng them also makes for good easy cash. STV is great for skinning and creating gold, so many other players are killing mobs there is loads to skin.
---
Also, I used to grind on the yetis in winterspring, when 55+. Could get great xp and stacks of rugged leather per hour.
---
Also, grinding the caves of dragonkin in the burning steps for black dragonscales brought loads of cash. LWers and guilds need the ale for Fire res for MC &amp; BWL raiding. 👍
---
Or on private server: w/FU
---
I never played on a PvP server entirely because of these horror stories lol
---
They made 1-20 free so now you are allowed to log in to any account even without an existing sub.
---
You, eh, got copies of those?
---
Go female orc tank. Looks great tanking with Crul'shorukh.
---
Good call. Doing a similar check for class/race combinations?
---
I think its not required. Marketing would inflate the budget which could hurt the game. Also, the Classic community itself is very good at marketing the game for everyone.
---
Considering the negativity surrounding 8.2, they might be forced to release Classic sooner, at least that's my hopes.
---
Leveled for a guy on nostalrius for a bit yesterday. Guy was in primary school and surprisingly competent.
---
In 5 man’s and burns you’re fine. In 20 man’s you can probably ot just fine. In 40 man’s you will be ot2 or 3. You’re there mostly because you are easier to gear up concurrent with 2-3 other warriors than it would be to gear up 3-4 warriors. There are some niche things you can do better, but overall warriors are superior tanks.
---
You’ve got a 1/40 shot at your slot. Figure 4 raiding (real) guilds on average on a given faction on a given server. That doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for feral tanks. 
---
If you want to raid, play a warrior. Your server may have warriors, but it will never have enough tanks. Want to gear out your warrior in prebis dps and prot? Just tank and make the groups. Don’t let paladins or dps warriors In the group. If it’s a leather piece, bring casters, etc. If you level your warrior and tank leveling up (can be specced arms/fury) people will know you by 60. If you tank your previs dungeons and talk to people, it’s likely you’ll have a raid spot by the time you’re geared.
---
No, me!
---
Wow, that picture seriously takes me back.
---
After.
---
I played a Troll shaman in BC, then never again. Even though Orc is the objectively superior choice, I'm pretty set on it even though it means I'm 100% a healbot.
---
Too soon !
---
\- warrior : it's like you forget it's weak in solo PVP until very well geared wich is not going to happen without a lot of time and effort
---
\- orc rogue has more than a " minor dps buff " it has imba stun resist for PVP
---
\-  "Troll is so much better than any race at Hunter that it’s a no-brainer " +5 bows is useless when the best weapons in game are crossbows, berserker is a minor DPS increase at the cost of some mana, +DMG against beasts is useless against bosses and 5 more AGI than an orc at lvl 60 is not game changing. All of this make it a little bit better at PVE, but orc stun resist is still bis for PVP.
---
The only good thing if everybody would listen to you is that we would have no more rogues, at last :D
---
Isnt regeneration basically a non factor? I was under the impression the health recovered was pitiful
---
Is that a female Orc? I mained one in Vanilla (male tho), felt like an outcast in my guild between all the UDs (we had one Troll to). It's all personal preference, but I think there will be plenty this time around. :D People didn't really choose based off racials back then
---
I will wait and see how the lag is. If there isn't any (doubt) then ill beging my classic career there. If there is then I will wait it out.
---
sharding in 10-20 will be neccessary for start. there will be like a thousand players at lvl 10 after 2-3h. let the noobs take 5 if u want. its gonna be a fuck fest.
---
50g to spec MS, then 50g to spec back.  
---
20g/hr. And for Vanilla, I think I am being more than generous. I'm sure I personally never managed that kind of income on a warrior, in any spec. I heard of Mages/Hunters making 50g/hr solo'ing DM, but I don't think warriors could solo it that efficiently.
---
If you're having fun why do you care what someone else says
---
no
---
Not many of the bosses require a taunt so that's not a good reason
---
i second this. so much bullshit 'memes'.
---
He's using it to suicide, not proc talents...
---
Gnomes knee up!
---
1. There are good reasons, none of them trump the reality that it’s 170-200+ hours played just to get to 60–if you don’t like your aesthetic, you’re goimg to hate it. Play what looks cool, embrace your kit.
---
2. Yes and no. When best raid gear is mc? Absolutely, you’ll be fine. When bwl is top, yes still due to PvP rewards. By aq and naxx, raid gear begins to outpace the highest attainable non raid gear. And if you never left dungeon blues, aq and naxx folks will eat your lunch. 
---
3. The top end grinding spots for mages/locks/hunters in dm is like 80g/hr top end. However, that’s pretty unrealistic for most folks. I haven’t grinded gold in Vanilla in a long time, but probably 3-6 hours to get back 50g initial and the 50g out. Later in the content it gets easier (silithus is a big wealth source)
---
Please do, we need better content than "look guys I found my Vanilla collector box" on this sub ;-)
---
Know when to use grounding totem. Don't just drop it on cooldown.
---
Can't argue with you, maybe except casting animations.
---
So true, the High Warlord on my server (Darkspear) helped me with my whirlwind axe quest. They were a warrior too so must've known the struggle
---
I make the briefest of appearances in that video at ~30 seconds on the dps meter!  I was the worst player that guild ever had lol
---
- For Priests, Trolls have a better racial for PvE and their racial spells are superior to Undead in PvP.
---
- As a Warlock, Orc is better against Rogues, the bane of your existence
---
- I wouldn’t say that Priest has a higher skill-cap than Shaman
---
Incredible job guys, super excited to see several of my favorite content creators in one place!
---
I do have one suggestion: I think dungeon guides should have their own category and not be in the leveling section as they are a distinct aspect of the game. I expect to see tips on faster leveling, paths and such in the leveling section, not so much dungeons.
---
The retail economie is all basted around boosting services now. Alot of people buy tokens everyweek for a heroic boost and mythic+ boost.
---
So one half of the playerbase pays for the other half his subscription. One half has to boost the other half.
---
Gold has no value besides playtime and cosmetics.
---
Gear has no value with 3th party websites showing your true progression.
---
It ruint alot.
---
For me it's always been Human or Night elf males that has been friendly like this.
---
If classic is a sucess, you can expect some sort of shop/token in classic. Activision wont care whether it would antithetical or not lol.
---
It's Blessing of Might..
---
I'm going to play with my with, we both love druids so double druid team it is. What would be viable ?
---
\-Double feral ?
---
\-One feral, one balance (healer, rooter), i'd really want to try this one but since it's vanilla, you know...balance.
---
use that for leveling: https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sZZVbLtrcqo
---
at lvl 34 u get the 4th point in deflection as a filler.
---
This made me smile, then laugh, then cry. RELEASE CLASSIC!
---
I'd wager that Orc TPS is better than Troll if the orc has an axe : less glancing blows mean more damage in the whole fight not 10s at the beginning.
---
...okay?
---
Night elf!
---
You clearly don't play horde enough to really experience the dark side of those pointy eared scumbags.
---
Nelf hunters are the Alliances equivalent of undead rogues.  Shadowmeld ganking lowbies from halfway across the map, and then they come and cheerfully bounce at you, at least a Forsaken eating you is just nature happening like a lion eating a gazelle, but that cheerful mocking bounce is just an insult to you for daring to not be as no life as they are.

It was always the Hunters fault!

so much this

Haha sounds like me IRL

With the exception that all around me are dwarves.
---
The problem is, every single barber prepares the style to be looked at "from the front", not from below, where it looks like garbage.
---
Only geared up hunters for it but it was decently easy. Blackstone Ring from mara you can even solo to get your hands on. But just being able to farm gold as a hunter makes everything easier in phase one.
---
Thunderfury is a sword, so MT troll has the best possible TPS.
---
Thunderfury is not something the average warrior will get, though.

Yeah dwarf racial is OP on a low lvl char on a fresh server. 
---
Niche racial but I wish I had it when classic release and buying my first abilities leave me with nothing !
---
Free action potion &gt; Orc Racial
---
Orc warrior is the clear PVE dps winner due to axe skill, which is going to carry through MC and BWL. Trolls dont have sword skill either, so the fact that the two BIS weapons at endgame are swords from Naxx does not matter.
---
I haven't played in years - and my server was pretty well balanced most of the time. During vanilla, I suppose Ally had a slight edge, so I'll give you that. But, that being said, most of the numbers I recall seeing for active server pops after that was highly in favor of Horde, especially during TBC and then continuing through most of WoTLK. I didn't play after that.  
---
As for pservers, the only one I ever checked into almost wasn't even worth logging into an Ally toon, because it was almost 80% hordeside.  
---
I do have a friend who has been playing (he helped get me into WoW during vanilla), and he's mentioned horde predominance, so I suppose I am biased toward those comments, so I could be wrong. \*shrug\* Either way, horde typically has easier quests (except Mankirk's wife), better travel systems (zeppelins &gt; boats), better city locations/flight paths for dungeon/raid access (STV's Grom'gol, Swamp of Sorrow's Stonard - and before anyone complains of how hard it is to get to Blackrock Mountain, don't forget Korgath, and for Onyxia you've got Brackenwall Village, then you're wayyyyyy closer via main city to Naxx from U-City), anyway, to continue, you've got Shamans &gt; Paladins, better overall racials... it's just so much easier!
---
Week at launch, week sometime later this year probably.
---
They'll go the Apex Legends route to this most likely.  Worked well for them, until they did one of the biggest, most epic screwed ups in years and lost all their momentum and hype.  They'll rely on streamer hype.

Ye Olde Goone Squade, on The Venture Co. EU :)
---
This is very true
---
You seem to know exactly what you’re talking about
---
I'm taking launch day off &amp; riding the lag/disconnects.
---
Though I'm taking enough holidays for it not to be an issue.
---
I am a fan of this analogy, I should know what I'm hoping for soon as I flip :)
---
sounds like some Greek or Turkish word
---
The problem with people who grind for BiS isn't that they will wait for the BiS. It's that they take every. single. upgrade. along. the. way.  
---
...and then demand the BiS.
---
1-20 Druid is complete trash as a leveling experience. Once you get cat form it becomes a lot easier and even a bit fun
---
Ultimately if you want the easiest time getting into a raid group, Resto Shaman is the way. The demand is just higher, you dont really need many Druids. 
---
Ultimately just play whatever you want. You'll be able to find a spot either way, just RShaman is easier.
---
I had to already book them. That being said I hope launch will be in the middle of my first week. Got chill time in advance to prep and I will be able to live through the ratchet battles that you just know will come and will be epic.
---
&gt;Must be a number between 2003 and 2019
---
 haha you took care of that. Was about to put some B.C. date.
---
BTW, B.C. = Before Classic
---
Yeah, it'd be an annoying way of doing it, but I imagine someone out there will try. They aren't gonna remove tokens from retail now for any stretch of time, you'd piss enough people off, but definitely not at launch; it's gonna be a few weeks before you have 60 hunters with enough farmed gold to sell.
---
&gt;Just take all the people with your mindset with you.
---
This is exactly what we do and then people cry about it. No one is forcing min maxing on anyone, don’t do it if you don’t want that’s fine.
---
what.is.this.shit?
---
Paladin blessing. King and might are huge for both tanking and dps. Wisdom and the eventual judgement of wisdom allow you to power shift for much longer.
---
Meanwhile horde side, you don't benefit that much from the totems (worse, often you won't get the few useful totem for you because they are not worth it for other class). Main dps and threat totem is windfury and you don't benefit from it at all in bear/kitty form.
---
Warry Tank?
---
I was the unluckiest vanilla player.
---
Played hardcore from 2004 to the end of vanilla. Failed thousands of gold, cleared every raid including naxx on black rock alliance.
---
Never saw one epic BoE drop out in the world.
---
To me, 6-10 was hardcore, because I was a Druid.
---
That furbolgs on the East, though
---
Druid deals more damage while leveling up, but Warriors pull ahead of basically everyone else as DDs by the end of MC.
---
But as a dwarf do you have mace skill to use the weapon ?
---
Because if you have to buy the skill for 10 silver (and run to IF) that weapon is not free anymore !
---
I quit after WotLK ended. I played like a week of Cata and it just didn't click with me anymore.  I'm hoping Classic lights that fire again, cause I'm excited for it.
---
so wanting to be useful is gonna be a bad thing in classic? this sub makes me think if you won't act like a noob you will be hated.
---
Can’t do it now at launch due to changed circumstances at work, but I’ll take even more time off now after the tempo dies down and won’t even feel a shred of guilt over it :)
---
It kind-of is, but I would still go orc for looks, axeskill, bloodfury and stun resist.
---
 **&lt;Delusional&gt; &lt;Alliance&gt;&lt;Oceanic&gt;&lt;PvP Realm&gt;** 
---
We are a Australian &amp; New Zealand based guild, we're looking at a semi-hardcore approach. Our goal in classic is to clear all raid content in an efficient manner and time. We are looking to be in the top ranks of the Oceanic guilds. 
---
* **Bnet**: Hyjax#6503 
---
* **Discord**: DAJpmJW 
---
* **Realm** : Oceanic 
---
* **Realm Type**: PVP 
---
* **Faction**:  Alliance 
---
* **Region**: Aus/Nz 
---
* **Timezone**: GMT+10 AEST
---
* **Guild Type**: Semi-hardcore 
---
* **Progression Raiding Times**: Thursday, Friday, Sunday &lt;6:30Pm-1030Pm&gt; 
---
* **Farming Raiding Times**:Thursday, Sunday &lt;6:30Pm-1030Pm&gt; 
---
* **Loot Rules**: loot counciled with fairness   
---
* **A Mindset for Progression**: We want the players that have experience with end game progression in mmos. Players who understand that it takes wipes, analysing the problems, and implementing change in order to kill a boss.  
---
* **Dedication to the Team**: We want players who understand they are part of a team. We value players who put the teams needs before their own, sacrificing their own personal gain to push the guild forward. Players that play for themselves and put their parse over the needs of the team or are loot hungry will be removed from the environment.  
---
* **A Humble Approach**: We expect players to always look to better themselves no matter how good they consider themselves. There is always something you can do better. Along with this comes being able to accept criticism without giving excuses.  
---
* **A Mature Mindset**: We are an 18+ environment and childish outbursts will not be tolerated here. You are expected to be respectful, calm, and able to work with others. We still joke and have a good time together but when it comes down to progression time, things are serious.
---
stun resist is also quite usefull for some of the harder trash in BWL (if you dont have FAPs or potion on CD).
---
I'm just waiting for the upheaval when in 2 years it's turned into BC Classic.
---
I remember when I was on my hunter (main) leveling up, I took a break at every level ending with a 9 to pvp. Also, I was able to buy a hurricane bow dirt cheap.
---
In the 49 bracket hurricane + broken tooth as bm... I just ate casters alive... Well anything not wearing plate really..
---
Aaah good times.
---
Hasn’t logged in 10 years...awww dammmm the feels
---
In Naxx gear, worldbuffs and flasks the 5% is quite noticable.
---
It’s honestly such an annoying back and fourth 
---
Hardcore raiders should play together in raids 
---
Non hardcore raiders should play together in raids 
---
That’s it, it’s that simple
---
It's neither a new game nor standalone. It's a "freebie" for WoW subscribers.
---
Blizzard created it for the fans (very rare occurrence nowadays), who they expect to be well informed enough about it.
---
That’s some list of classic wow content creators
---
It sure it. Rotating warstomps on some trash packs in raids can be very effective indeed.
---
what it makes it easier?
---
How is doing 50% dmg competative? Also I find a lot of feral druids doing about half of rogues but no boomkins.
---
I'll probably make note of the mats required, and hunt tailors along the way. Tip them extra mats and they should be happy.
---
I'll be enchanting, so I can tip them some of my leveling enchants too. I'll be handing those out for free probably.
---
If I find a friendly tailor rushing to max level I might toss him some cloth each day to help him out &amp; then he can let me know when he gets better bags.
---
Are we all forgetting the bad assert of female UD animations?
---
Fellow Hakkar players! Those names are familiar. I used to be in &lt;Broken&gt;/&lt;Infuriate&gt; as well.
---
Well… Work decided this for me Q_Q
---
JUN i'm home for 5 days 
---
AUG I'm home for 7 days 
---
…
---
Well at least i wont be there to suffer from the overcrowded starting areas and server instabilities … right ? RIIIIIGHT ????
---
F M L
---
Even in vanilla wow people used addons to make QoL changes to the game.
---
Around same progress in vanilla, only caster flasked for first patchwerk kill after wiping to it barely for a week straight.  Other then that it was tanks only getting flasks.  There literally wasn't enough lotus spawns in the world for more then one guild to full flask every week.  Private server dynamic spawns are crazy high in comparison.
---
It's me. :)
---
What? It's not elitist not want to carry deadweight in raids.
---
In Shadow Fang Keep there is a mob if enemies that had like a .1% chance of dropping a rare dagger called Assassin' Blade. It dropped and we rolled for it (Need as I was a rogue and it was an upgrade) 4 out of 5 people rolled need but I still won. My priest friend I was in the group with whispered me and told me not to equip it but to sell it in the auction house for a large amount of gold as it was one of the better Twink weapons. I did and ended up getting like 299g from it. Naturally I used it to buy fiery enchants for my daggers I replaced 5 levels later and other junk my friend told me not to do like you know save it for my mount which he ended up helping me buy because I was an idiot (thank you and sorry Dan).
---
Those are excellent points.  Thank you for sating my curiosity!
---
Thinking of a dorf priest ( dont like humans and elves). I love how they look in t1 with bened and I dont care about more progression than that.
---
But Im worried about their farming strength. They seem weak and DME ( which wont be available the first months) gold potential isnt certain cuz it may be worse than what people saw on pservers. Its a very costly class for pve cuz of the amount of mana pots you gonna use.
---
I guess you also just imagine that you have fun while playing.
---
&gt; They were only done when necessary
---
You're thinking of the free transfers. But vanilla already had the [They were only done when necessary](https://web.archive.org/web/20070202035112/http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/faq/paidcharactertransfer.html)
---
\&gt;a lot of private servers use incorrect xp rates for 1.12
---
Well, the issue is there isn't much overlap aside pre-raid stuff (specially weapons) and the few ones are pieces that every physical fighter wants. DFT, accuria, trinkets and later on armor tokens in Naxx and/or AQ40. That's where the actual competition is. 
---
No melee worth its salt would roll on a hunter-praised ranged weapon in a raid aside Larvae or the Slavemaker with Naxx on farm. The other 2 are hunter-only (Rhok requires a hunter-only quest, Ashjre'thul has only rap, useless for any melee). A similar thing goes for melee weapons.
---
Supposedly shaman can duo with war or rogue to kill bosses in dme and also mine the thorium at the end. One of u needs enchanting. Might not be ok without decent gear.
---
If you're on the fence at all about PvP vs PvE servers, just go to the PvP server. The experience is more meaningful and the community is more bonded do to the world conflicts. 
---
Sometimes it's frustrating to get ganked, but all of the additional social elements pvp adds trumps that imo.
---
There is nothing wrong with choosing PvE, but I just think if you're undecided your missing out on some great content.
---
And you would lose, since tanking axes sucks (i.e. there aren't many)
---
Just the subscription/game time
---
Though, I guess that old World of Warcraft or Battle Chest keys would still work, if you find one.
---
What if their store accepts only euros?
---
There is no need to worry. Just buy white weapons from vendors until lvl 9-12 and you'll be fine. Don't waste your time with blacksmith or looking for chests, those are meme strats.
---
« Chases you across the map to buff you »
---
Reminds me the moron I’d buffed with my « pink paw » that whisped me « I HAVE LESS HP, WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME? ».
---
« I’ve granted you a buff that increases all you stats, armour and resistances. You HP’s are now growing »...
---
Both gamestop and walmart sell timecards
---
There are so many more ways to make gold than instance AoE farming. You could pair up with a Warrior and farm bosses, flip stuff on the AH or gather Herbs. The list is endless.
---
I agree to an extent. You could view it as „do you plan to choose race/class based on min/maxing“
---
Even fucking daggers
---
&gt;for specific reasons or a healer chooses to be a healer
---
To be fair, healers aren't choosing to be healers its just the viable PvE spec. 
---
Id be alright with a battleground spec or something. But otherwise I agree that there shouldn't be spec swapping.
---
Well, I still recall WotLK BiS for many being a different armor class. Ele shams going for cloth boots, warriors aiming for leather bracers for armor pen, enh shams (as I did in the time) aiming for leather bracers form Halion...
---
It wasn't as common but 2 expansions later the problem was still there to an extent. 
---
Itemization's balance is quite thin and hard to do.
---
They can also tank their own ubrs and reserve those items
---
I was in Tales of the Past! It was filmed on Dunemaul EU.
---
If certs matter less and less, what do you recommend as the best thing for an IT career? (Currently in a more entry-level position myself)
---
Sorry, I know this is a WoW subreddit, but I keep finding conflicting info around the web.
---
I'd be okay with a battleground specific spec, but beyond that I dont think there should be a second spec.
---
Well if you go Healer/Boomkin hybrid and Feral Tank you will be able to start a group for literally any 5 man content and fill it very quickly.
---
Double feral is gonna be rough because you'll both take the same gear from each other.
---
I have been maining paladin since vanilla, and used every spec. One of my smoothest dungeon runs while I was healing was with a protection paladin (Emerald Dream). There was a guy who was maintanking with prot paladin in 40m, so it's not impossible either (however, I never hear from other dudes what are there opinion on prot paladin maintanking, whom have been raiding with one for long, all the concerns are coming from those who never experienced it).
---
I will roll a prot paladin too when classic hits, and because I have a similar mentality as you mentioned, I can definitely recommend you playing prot paladin. And remember, you can always put narrow-minded people on ignore list.
---
I would advise against picking a class based on how easy their BiS gear is to obtain. You’re spending weeks, if not months leveling a character, you want to make sure that you’re going to enjoy the play style.
---
There’s nothing worse than levelling a mage because you were told they have low competition for BiS gear, only to realize you actually don’t find it fun to press one button for 2 hours straight.
---
We did two. Mind you we were pretty geared at this point.
---
Pull Geddon and Shazzrah together (we did this one on accident thanks to do a DC) If you plan it, it's probably not bad at all. Just split the raid into tank/healers 1 and 2 and ranged on Shazz, melee on Geddon. Boom.
---
Pull Ebonroc and Flamegor together. Again, pretty doable. Just have two tanks up top with some healers, focus one down, move on to the other. I suggested we up the ante and do all 3 at once, but that involves leaving healers and tanks behind to keep Firemaw's attention while trash gets cleared and nobody seemed to want to take the time to do that :(
---
Just wait 2 years for BC classic. For me that was the primo WoW days.
---
I remember doing this.
---
😂 sadly you can not do it as a warrior tank 😅
---
Holy pala
---
Big pool of items but tbh the good ones are mainly cloth so u still compete with the squishies
---
Maybe rdudus have it easier? Their leathers dont look interesting for hpalas and rshams
---
The Relentless - Frostwhisper (EU). Resto druid.
---
As long as you have the money. A lot of tanking pre raid bis gear is BoE.
---
Why not just do tailoring and herbalism, save all the herbs you pick and afternyou have crafted your robe and tons of bags drop tailor during MC and start alchemy.
---
I really don't get the dislikes, being spammed dislikes just because you have another opinion than another what's wrong with this community.
---
That's what I tought. With  Balance/Feral there is the advantage of gear splitting. Balance can take all cloth/leather gear with intellect, feral can take agility gear.
---
&gt; blames himself after wipe to keep the group going even thought it was the hunter's fault     
---
     
---
My group after wipe: rabble rabble rabble (we just ate the damage from mechanics)
---
Me, a H Paladin: nah it's all good guys, we got this next time. I could have bubble that dps and was a bit late on that holy light on the tank
---
But highly expensive so most of them need alternatives
---
I loved it so much. Killing someone and seeing that they are still watching you... you walk over and start cannibalizing. They INSTANTLY release spirit 100% of the time.
---
Some of the holiday food is percent based, if I remember right.
---
On the bright side you shit on them in pvp
---
oh boy, this really hits me. 100 % true and can't wait for the feeling again
---
It's not black and white, just because you are not going for world first does not mean you want to spend 14 hours clearing MC.
---
[It's literally impossible to get a +5 str bracers at lvl 14.](http://classicdb.ch/?items=4&amp;filter=MOD_A=4:5:99;sl=9;#0+2+3+1)
---
As a healer I’ll take a skilled warlock tank over a bad warrior(hyperbole)
---
Seriously tho I run strat live 10 or so times a week and sometimes have a pala tank and a few of the guys I run with are amaaaaazing. Maybe they take more damage, but if I’m able to free cast and not constantly heal DPS then it literally doesn’t matter. 
---
Druids are my favorite tanks period, so much HP and AOE threat + some self healing if I’m low on mana and wanna drink right when a fight ends. I cannot stress enough how much I love a good Druid tank. I even have one that will innervate me so we can keep pulling.
---
They require a lot of keybinds for PvP mostly. They need quite a few macros to control their pets.
---
18 in 4.8 hours equals 26250 xp/h - starting at level 1. That's the high end of xp/h to expect at level 22. Guy is full of shit.
---
Why this date in particular?
---
What do you mean two? You did 30 min Baron run?  
---
   
---
I guess you could have a section for raids as well. There will be log websites with leader boards for clears and boss speed kills for sure so I figure the raid teams will be focused on that. It would be fun if they had sections for more 'gimmicky' stuff like 2 bosses at once, Hakkar with priests still up, 20 man kills etc. Onxyia is just sort of a special one because it's easy for a small amount of people to organise and do without it taking forever or too high requirements.
---
This also is acceptable. 2 is underrated.
---
Dispel
---
Dispel 
---
And dispel 
---
As a Paladin I’ve fought a lot of shamans who flat out won’t dispel me and it blows my mind. I almost want to just remove my own buffs for them. 
---
LOOK AT MY FEET IDIOT THEYRE GLOWING TAKE THIS OFF ME.
---
You do realize that some people have fun by being good at the game, right? You don't *need* to be awful and clueless to have a great experience.
---
Can you fill me in on this apex screw up?
---
You can always go the [totem twisting route](https://i.redd.it/c63vpruj4utz.jpg) and take all the credit for the rogues' and warriors' dps!
---
King of the STV jungle
---
Especially elf with a cat
---
I love this 
---
I love when a sham just drops grounding to start a fight. Like okay bro I’ll just melee this once and now you’re stunned except fuck you’re an orc so resist and 3k chain lightening to my face
---
Oh dang my my finals are next week!
---
No, not 2H. But at least the trainer is in IF.
---
The ud mage Vurtne wannabe's are going to be the ones doing the ganking
---
No I mean we did two 'challenges', the ones I listed.
---
don't give up, skeleton!
---
Totem of rebirth is easy to get and the total would be 30 mins cd. You can't count.
---
just need something to help me choose between the 4 classes i want to play, i know i will enjoy them all.
---
What happened
---
Well the mount itslef probably … the riding skill it a whole different story :p
---
Night Elves are never "friendly" they're insufferable.
---
For 14 lvl is not at lvl 14 bro.
---
Please read again.
---
Most fun I've had was playing my priest in BGs healing. I remember when priests got Prayer of Mending. Boy was that fun.
---
You do get a lot of new pets as every hunter and lock will stick their pet on you. I kept some snacks in my back pocket for that whole menagerie. You get to pet tigers wolves hogs turtles and the occasional succubus. It's wonderful.
---
Clearly more people don't agree with you though.
---
Milk me
---
"For 14 lvl" means for 14 lvl, not "since lvl 14"
---
It's awesome I much prefer annoying rabid mongoloids blowing every single cooldown in a futile attempt to kill me on their *yet another* undead rogue.
---
I will play paladin I will spit.
---
With 300% dmg increase 13500 crit would be  3375 without the buff.
---
I'm going the same way with my mage.
---
Im not really a fan of fresh realms. I like to play when a decent economy is formed.
---
I love pvp healing 
---
I love being that guy that the whole other team is after, I love netting a warrior who charges me, I love bubbling when the warrior charges me, I love stunning the rogue and then throwing a grenade once my stun is up, I love laughing at a feral Druid who is attacking me for some reason and spamming /tickle at them. 
---
Mostly I love being a bro to my friends, freedom on a stuck warrior or hunter(a good hunter with freedom is underrated as fuck), cleansing dots / marks off my rogue bros, BOPing my mage / warlocks / priests. 
---
Just tonight I entered a WSG a bit late and saw one of my regular warriors getting gang banged. Raced to the hut he was fighting by and literally got a lay on hands off on him with 1% HP, chugged a mana pot, scrolls of blinding light, freedom, heal, and we ended up winning that fight. 
---
People appreciate you, if you’re good you’ll get whispers the second you log in to join along with whatever. I enter a BG and mages will have water ready for me, warlocks health stones. 
---
Specially as a Paladin survivability is great, I’ve held AB flags on my own against 5 guys between lay on ands and bubble, and when my bubble has 2 seconds left and I see 5 of my homies run up while I’ve defended the flag and we keep it. Such a great feeling
---
In 5 mans but in raids there isnt much difference. Gonna be lots of both anyway.
---
people will be selling their drops in /1 for cheap,
---
Love the name, pure pwnage was ahead of its time.
---
The idea is u will know what u want while its flippin
---
Right so raid with a hardcore guild
---
Heh. If not the UI then the consumable usage is a good giveaway. Even best guilds back in retail vanilla didn't know about the consumables they are using in the screenshot.
---
Gotta keep up those moral bars.
---
Totally agree! I’m deliberately getting a good gaming laptop so I can play on the move. I’ll maybe even manage an hour or so in work. My plan is to use lunchtime to vendor my crap, DE any poor greens on an enchanting alt, and AH all other stuff. This allow me to just focus on leveling once home from work and the kids are in bed 😂
---
Most zones with remnants of Old Gods, Black Empire, and Legion influence have very cool questlines. I loved the quests of Darkshore, Ashenvale, Desolace, Blasted Lands, Tanaris, Silithis (eventually) etc...
---
Also Thousand Needles and Southern Barrens near the Krauls cover the razorquills lore which is also very eldritch.
---
&gt; it's like a study guide for an exam
---
There's a difference. One is useful in life, the other you do for a grade.
---
Aye that’s a good idea. I’ve already joined up to a busy wee guild with many looking forward to classic. I’m sure I’ll be able to get a guildie to make some if I have the mats 😀👍
---
Less loot competition for my pre BiS!
---
that the one that ends with a raid boss?
---
&gt; Priest: Dwarf or Forsaken. Not even close here, these are by far the best races for priest.
---
Trolls are better for PvE hands down.
---
&gt; Mage: Doesn’t matter, play whatever.
---
Seems odd that for hunter you say NE over Dwarf for a small difference in agility (despite Stoneform being the most amazing alliance pvp racial) but don't pick gnome for their extra 5% intel, and troll for Beserking in PvE.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Paladin: Doesn’t matter, play whatever. Both Humans and Dwarves are pretty equal at healing. 
---
Again, Stoneform OP.
---
&gt; Shaman: Doesn’t matter, play whatever. 
---
Again, Beserking. Trolls are best for PvE.
---
&gt; Warlock: A rank
---
For pvp, sure. For everything else, definitely a B.
---
&gt; Paladin: Decent in PvP. 
---
They're the strongest pvp healers there are.
---
All that being said, I do agree with you on 
---
&gt; Doesn’t matter, play whatever.
---
I have two thoughts on that.
---
First, the obligatory "have you heard of our lord and saviour ~~Jesus Christ~~ engineering? It shall forgive you of your sins in PvP". 
---
Now that that's out the way, I was going to suggest something similar to beaver tranq. I would go herb/skinning, vendor all the skinning mats, mail all the cloth and herbs you get to a bank alt to send back to you when it's time to make some bags and truefaith just drop skinning for tailoring, send the cloth back, make your stuff, and then drop tailoring for alch. I suppose that's a bit more work than most might like, so you can skip the skinning part of that if that doesn't appeal to you.
---
Just please don't shield a warrior, he needs the rage income from getting hit :(
---
Looking cool
---
Fadeleaf is a 0.05% droprate from boxes in BRD, u think thats even a valid source of fadeleaf income? Im legit asking because i dont know
---
They hated Jesus cuz he told the truth
---
Ah, the one that got away.
---
Great that makes sense!
---
I completely agree with picking up the gathering professions on my journey to 60!
---
Best of luck with Classic bud!
---
I mean, mages and warlocks only use frost/shadowbolt. Not more engaging at all.
---
Luck
---
The pets are like $300 on ebay and I've seen boxes without the code for as low as $70. Might be worth taking a look.
---
Casters love wanding it

Female dwarf always, it's like being in a party with a rarespawn and is awesome in of itself.

That’s a pretty common sci if/fantasy trope. 
---
And it was already a trope blizzard had explored with the coming of the orcish horde in the first place. Humans, dwarves elves to come together to face a greater threat.
---
it probably wont be early... im expecting mid summer

If only people were this serious in their real life..

Depends how much spirit you stack.

What’s a mage gonna do to make gold in stage 1?

It was such a strong bonus that people were using it through TBC and it had to be nerfed, even.

* Use of racials, Warstomp for a nice Stun+Heal or Stun+CL combo, same goes for Berserking.
---
* Use Ghost Wolf if specced
---
* WF Totem if you are in group with a Melee
---
* Against fearing classes, always have Tremor up and stay in range
---
* Fakecast heals with your hearthstone to provoke interrupts
---
* Have engineering and use it
---
* Use autoattack when in melee range. Its not much but its a small amount of extra damage for free. In combination with Frostbrand Weapon its also a chance to slow the enemy
---
* Use Shields
---
* Rank 1 LB to get casters infight or interrupt heals
---
* Sentry Totem and Far Sight are not worthless !
---
* Have a good overview over your team and your enemies. You are able to burst, heal or distract. You need to know when its time for what.
---
* Purge. Always. Purge.
---
Engineering Scares me Abit honestly seems like a lot of work (no salvation for me it seems)
---
Thanks for the Tipp it seems the herb/skinning way is the Most efficent i will Most likely try that.

Thanks for your Time and have a Great Rest of the week

Orc best melee animation in the game.
---
Grinding beasts is already a great way to make your mount money because of the greys they drop. Skinning just makes it even more effective. But it's not how much money you get from gathering professions that make the difference, it's how much you save by not levelling production professions. I would highly recommend skinning/mining or skinning/herbalism for your first character. It'll give you a solid start and allow you to boost your second character's professions.
---
Will of the forsaken is really good if you fuck up berserker rage tanking ony. And female undead have really nice animations.
---
Protean Syndicate on Dragonblight. Good times
---
A hardcore guild means going for records and X firsts. That's awesome but takes a lot of time commitment which most people don't have. If you don't want to slog through 14 hour MC carrying selfish morons trying to have "fun" then you should have more options. So what are you talking about?
---
Lol? Quite the unfair advantage. 
---
“Hey let’s compare our dps”
---
“Sure”
---
“Alright, let me just strap on a 20% increase that im intentionally withholding from you” 
---
A PI’d balance Druid doesn't beat a PId mage, why would the priest give you pi in a raid?
---
And thats at least 2 seconds for you to cast a heal, CL, grenade or just get some distance.
---
I love fishing and cooking. I give away free Nightfin Soup to leveling casters whenever possible. And in dungeons I like to bring Wolf Steaks and stuff. Good for morale, too :)
---
Yeah absolutely fair haha!
---
Its like in MOBAs where the healer gets dove and he needs peeling. Nobody will help.
---
Aka the only races that can't be rogues. Figures...
---
Nah hardcore guilds are just min max guilds who wanna move fast in raids &amp; get it done as optimal as possible. Which sounds like what you want.
---
Keep in mind that the teleport is a Balance spell in Vanilla.  I can tell you it was one of the most panic inducing moments I had in Vanilla.
---
Not PvP.
---
A damned mob mind controlling me and casting the teleport skill.

---
Normally people going for rank 14 formed premade groups that would run AB all day. You would have to keep up getting wins in roughly 2mins all day for roughly 3 months depending on how much you actually play. Some people used to account share with people in different time zones so that they would have maximum up-time on farming.
---
This made me LMAO
---
Let me preface with this is my own opinion. I don't have 30 plus years in the industry. I have about ~12. If you are entry level (less than 5 years) certs help a lot, especially in the absence of a college degree(As or BS). If 5-10 years certs can help gain certain jobs if the company cares. Or help close gaps in your working experience. 15 years plus, not to say certs dont matter anymore, but from what I have seen and been told nobody really  cares what certs you have when you have 15+ years under your belt. Of course some companies require certs as a Baseline regardless or exp. Or some contractor positions may 100% a specific cert.
---
If a person is trying to break into the IT field I always recommend the same things. 1. Get a home lab going, make and break VMs all day using esxi. 2. Study and earn A+, Network+, and Security+ in that order. 3 if possible either an AS degree in IT or some sort of volunteer work doing IT for 2 years. That's what's I did anyways and it's worked out well enough so far
---
If you’re even slightly serious about PvP engineering is a must
---
For horde u get orc healer shaman
---
The racial will help u survive
---
Well said, /u/An_Unraped_Cat.
---
Looks great!
---
Lol no. That's just playing the game normally.
---
Vanilla raids are so easy? Hahaha
---
I liked it. But the internet loves to hate sword Art Online, especially season 2
---
Haha, same honestly. It's a bit intimidating for me too, and alch is super fun in my opinion. 
---
Ish-ne-alo por-ah (May the days ahead be guided by the elders of long ago, in Taur-ahe).

---
Obviously don’t know what your job is but 4G data is pretty cheap and WoW doesn’t use a lot, I play games like WoW/CS/DotA tethered to my phone all the time when I’m away at university as the internet there is crap.
---
I certainly remember CoI. They were the premier guild alliance side, at least in the early days of the server.  
---
Although I levelled a Dwarf Priest to 60 and did some MC, I mained Horde and remember well the BWL races between the top horde guilds like OTD and Hive.  
---
Check out [https://www.vanillafriends.com/friends.php?region=eu#vanillaTable=l27:vf5](https://www.vanillafriends.com/friends.php?region=eu#vanillaTable=l27:vf5) You might find someone you knew.
---
Troll aren't the best because tps, they're the best cause they are trolls, the best race in the game by all standards
---
You are the decoy to buy time for ur so called team to kill something
---
it's not ready, why would they need to? Everyone in the target audience is well aware of it and doesn't mind the wait. Anyone they might want to pick up later can wait until it's actually close to release.
---
5 man UBRS would be insane if not impossible without amazing gear.
---
I mean you can call it semi hardcore or whatever you want if that makes you feel better but in the raiding scene there’s really just hardcore and causal and guilds who are min maxing specs to improve raid times are considered hardcore even if there are more hardcore guilds. 
---
My original point still stands that everyone should just play in guilds with people who have the same play style as them
---
&gt; trade someone a token in BFA for gold in Classic", which is true, but also against ToS
---
Trading for gold is NOT against the TOS, trading for real money is.
---
Tfw the hermanos lose the fight
---
I will try skinning/herbalism and then do what you said thanks for your time.
---
The hyype is increasing day by day
---
To use the engineering tools you need to have a certain lvl in engineering is that right?
---
Well see what classic endgame brings when i get there.
---
Thanks for your time.

---
"LF1M ZG Hakkar, need Tauren/Undead/Troll tank"
---
It stung.
---
I don't think there is anything below the "semi hardcore" you describe, at least that can sustain itself for very long. They will either quit or become normal players (who want timely raid clears but not create new records or firsts).
---
No reason? How about wanting raids to go quickly and smoothly?
---
Same, I am used to level up 3 to 4 chars simultaneously just to avoid the class burnout. 
---
Once I hit 40 gets damn tragic for me for some reason.
---
Every token you bought on the AH was bought on the WoW store by another player for $20.
---
I dont know why, buts thats adorable
---
If you have a pocket priest warrior ofc.
---
Blizzard aren’t retarded, there is a 0% chance of tokens in classic.
---
And use Snowballs on bridge :-)
---
Yeah nothing that you’re saying is relevant at all to my original point and you’re arguing some pretty silly semantics here. 
---
Just raid with people who fit your raid style 
---
Hardcore, semi hardcore, semi casual, hardcasual, mega casual, upside down, inside out, only Druids, only priests 
---
Whatever you wanna call it, just stick with people you’ll enjoy playing with
---
Back in Vanilla they would open new servers and allow free transfers to them from overpopulated servers. I suspect they may do the same this time so players have a way to avoid queues every day.
---
I don't think anybody thinks that it will be "common" to stack classes in classic. Some guilds on private servers "speed run" content doing stuff like 20 minute MC / BWL runs or 30 minute AQ40 by stacking like 15 Warriors and 10 Rogues, but that is a very minority out of all the players.
---
However there is a massive difference between stacking classes and  stacking meme specs. If a guild doesn't want to use meme specs it doesn't mean that it's some super hardcore class stacking guild, most normal semi casual guilds don't even use meme specs in raids.
---
Some guilds will bring a Ret Paladin or a Moonkin but we're talking of like 1 player per raid. With the amount of new people wanting to play those specs I find it hard to believe that every one of them will find a raid spot.
---
There's only so many guilds on a server and I don't think most of them will be running 5 Ret Paladins, Moonkins and Enhancement Shamans in them in the same raid.
---
I can understand if the rest of some casual guild doesn't mind carrying 1 or even 2 meme specs in a raid, but I don't think you will see it become the norm that those specs infest the majority of raiding guilds and take multiple spots in the raid.
---
Private server players are just regular humans and players just like anyone who plays retail WoW and 90% of them are casual players. If we don't see 10 Moonkin raids on those servers I don't think we will see them in classic either because most people will realize that a raid team like that just sucks.
---
if you roll a priest and take tailoring as one of your professions you can craft your pre-raid BiS gear. Not 100% sure but it might also be BiS until Tier 2? Definitely BiS pre-raid though.
---
&gt; You could pair up with a Warrior and farm bosses
---
if one of us has disenchanting and the prices are good ( mature economy)

if u got the epic mount in the first place

lol.
---
Hydraxis server on the US 
---
It was named Divine Wrath.
---
Private servers are completely free to play on largely run by corrupt admins making bank from selling gold.
---
It’s not even remotely the same.
---
Clearing in a raid in grey items only.
---
I love midnight MMORPG releases. It means I can go to bed as usual. When I get home from work, I can cast a brief look at the forums to see all the rage posts from the night and during much of the day. And then proceed to smoothly log in.
---
Giving ppl stamina buff as you cross paths in levelling zones always felt great. I even had some ppl come back to me later and ask for a re-buff.
---
Now im going to main a rogue, gonna miss this part :(
---
You get one from your level 10 class quest.
---
Will there be a huge number of players at launch, probably into the millions ?  
---
Yes
---
Will the majority of those still be playing 1 month after launch?  
---
No
---
Does that matter?  
---
Ion was quite clear that it doesn’t matter if there is 10k or 10m people playing classic the servers will be there as long as retails are.
---
Female Bonus Perk: ponytail is flying everywhere when casting spells.

Mechanically yes

Did you play ally or horde on Shattered Hand?

Nelf are the undead of the Alliance, the only two friendly races are Tauren and Dwarf. I never kill a Dwarf or Tauren.
---
&gt;Goes AFK mid-raid during a boss fight to pet dog
---
What kind of monster wouldn't?
---
Warrior is quite slow. I never lvled one but a friend did in vanilla and he struggled when he was solo a lot. In vanilla I lvled a rogue, mage, druid and paladin to 60. Paladin was on pair with Mage, Druid a bit faster (feral, 0 downtime good dmg) and rogue almost as annoying as Warrior.
---
Alliance Hunter ? So you have no competiton on the mail and so you get the BiS gear "easily"
---
I imagine making deals to trade Classic gold for retail tokens is going to be against ToS. Why would Blizzard allow it to happen unofficially and not implement it themselves?
---
It’s the same sub, if you’re playing classic you’re subbed to retail and vice versa.
---
So obviously it would be impossible for the concurrent subs to ever be different.
---
Hat Club. Dragonmaw EU. Good times.
---
Still niche but useful af is the ability to see what crates in strat are good vs crates that are traps.

Cleansing that stupid fucking poison is so annoying an legit fucks up my 5 second regen
---
Imagine the outcome for committing himself to this challenge. It's clearly reflected upon his video where he initially joked about it; 684k viewers. Absolutely insane.
---
How big were the shards in Legion? Because if a city raid completely breaks a shard then there is 0 guarantee that even sharding will make the launch bearable lol.
---
Assuming the shards are between 40 and 100 then there is a good chance that things will lag crazily regardless since everyone will be at one spot.
---
This camera worked on pre-patch and at the start of the Legion. I didn’t like content, but this camera made the game more interesting and better, I’ve been waiting for this setting for 12 years. I was very upset when they was removed two weeks after the launch of the Legion, after that I left WoW  retail forever, tired of constant disappointments.
---
I’ve been using MMO mice for about a decade now. They are fantastic for all games, but obviously mmos benefit more greatly. I currently use a Redragon Perdition because it suits me better ergo-wise, but I also have a G600 and a Naga. Setting up your buttons and then using an alt, Ctrl, or/and a shift modifier is also an excellent way to maximize usage of your mouse.
---
Used F1 through F4 as well, but later on bought a mouse with 12 buttons on the side, I've normalized them across all my chars, eg: button 1 always snare spells, button 2 counterspells, 3 to 5 stances/forms etc
---
I was 13 and lied my way into an 18+ guild, didn’t use mic in raid as I said people were sleeping, where the raid leader was a mid 40s soccer mom, the main tank was her long distance boyfriend, and we had constant raid breaks because her kids were fighting in the background
---

 &lt;Healing Spree&gt; EU - Ahn'qiraj

-*Stances in Berserking moans*-
---
The real question is ... did it consume a Soul Shard? xD
---
It's all the same stuff anyway.
---
It's not as if the 'new' discussion threads are actually new. It's the same crap we've been talking about for years now. There is nothing new to be said. Everyone is just waiting for release at this point. Aside from some weekly threads, which the board has, and consists of the same issues and questions that people have had for years, what do you do? Share the same memories for the 15th time? Speculation? There isn't much to speculate as it is, and it has already been speculated.
---
Sure, most of the memes aren't particularly funny (if at all) but what else is there to post right now? We've covered it all. Everything is saturated. What is your alternative? You've just added another post about the saturation of memes, adding to the saturation of 'saturation of memes' posts.
---
I have a feeling that people are going to be incredibly helpful and friendly during the first few months in classic. Probably because helping you may also be helping them, but it'll be nice to see
---
Arathor Alliance - "Black Rose Immortals"
---
&lt;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot&gt; EU - Al-akir: Went all the way from MC through to Naxx, what a blast. It disbanded when TBC was announced.
---
alchemy is great for end game raiding cos of all the pots, my plan is to change to this once I am 60 and I have suitable gear to start MC. 
---
for leveling, I'm going skinning and/ or herb/mining, and will save all the mats on a bank alt for leveling either engineering or alch once I have my epic mount and a good gold supply :D
---
I was in the EU branch of the WoW Radio guild \&lt;Violent Noise\&gt; on the newly-opened RP-PvP realm Defias Brotherhood.  Those were some good times with some good people.  Good server too.  I still remember this one druid (Nichevo I think his name was) who always posted in character in the realm forums talking how much he loved fishes.  For years, he continued to receive random fish in the mail from people.
---
There was a little friction with a few guilds because we were set up explicitly to be a raiding guild and some of the RP-focused players were worried that we would ruin that for them by acting massively OOC in public chat (like a few of the people following Project 60 did).  But for the most part things actually went smoothly.
---
yeah, I had that problem on my hunter....trying to hide as a capped the bunkers was always tough as a massive bull! :D
---
Yeah nobody is crying about some memespec funguild that goes into MC to wipe a few hours and disband lmfao.
---
Is the big woman here?
---
yeah, its a brilliant fight at the end, with elites and a boss at the end. Loved it.
---
I mean, I don’t care too much. It would be cool, though, if we did not upvote so many low quality memes. That’s almost worse than the high quantity.
---
WoW discussion can be a bit tricky. There is often not so much to discuss. If you browse by top and specify a time interval, things get much better.
---
Then again memes tend to drown the bit of actual discussion that could exist.
---
I always have an alt for shit like alchemy/lw, on the main you should always be engineer + something else beneficial to your class in the case of priest/mage/lock that is tailoring for the BoP epic robe.
---
You can max out any profession on alts all you need is level 35 wich is like 1 day played with rested and twink gear.
---
Oh yeah a one-handed weapon from memory.
---
Also to name yourself Alexbones and shout Azeroth themed conspiracy theories in trade.
---
The yetis in winterspring were great to grind on. they are soft and quishy and easy to kill, could easily grind 10+ stacks of Rugged leather an hour, plus all the vendor rubbish which goes with it. 
---
Another one (but slightly tougher) was the dragonkin in the burning stepps for the black dragonscales.
---
Too bad, since the beta files were stored on the CDN I am hyped again like I was back in the day! I need more info! I need a date so I can fix my schedule Damn I am so hyped to start once again with my Dwarf Priest. The only problem I am worried About it choosing the wrong realm and end up with 20-80 or just medium pop since I always played on a high pop server.
---
Nailed it down to Horde Warlock w/ herbalism and tailoring and I can't choose between Orc and Undead. Help!
---
Hunters were good to level, and get gear for. Tougher was trying to get 2 x Bone slicing hackets to drop in Strath.
---
Warlock is pretty easy. Has a lot of BOE crafted gear if I recall correctly. But I'm honestly just making a statement without proper reference.
---
When I used to worked for a managed services IT company we had the manager of a vet clinic that was one of our clients come in with her son's laptop. It was riddled with viruses.      
---
I managed to remove them all and it allowed us to properly boot into windows again. His desktop background was a WoW image, from memory a panoramic shot of Ironforge. I thought that was pretty cool as I played WoW at the time.       
---
As I was downloading and installing Malwarebytes to do a final scan, I noticed he had a whole bunch of images in his 'Downloads' folder. The were all cartoon drawings of WoW characters naked and having sex, mostly female dwarves getting railed by male dwarves with massive dicks. It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
---
Just another rogue though...
---
I hope they add a realm called Chris Metzen👏🏽
---
Right, it’s a moot point really. But Blizzard themselves will know what their traffic is for each game, and I’m sure it probably spells “victory” for Classic if they *do* have to open up extra realms partway through the game, multiple times, while many servers on the modern game are skeletons.
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJKNM6VINHY&amp;t=115s) claims they did it in T2 gear while ubrs was a 15 man instance.  
---
It might take a while but I think it'd would be doable around T1/T2 level with a good group. 45min Baron 3 man would be much harder I'd imagine, I think you might need AQ/Nax gear for that.
---
Why would they connect you to additional servers? The goal for them is to have less players per shard, not more.
---
Flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker flicker.   
---
I found a badger
---
Improved faerie fire giving the %hit would make them go from undesirable to mandatory right quick as well.
---
Man this is a sub about a 15 year old game which is not even released yet. There is only so much to talk about...
---
Every possible discussion about wow classic already happened here, now it's just a rehash of the same thing over and over. As long as we don't have our hands on the game, there's nothing but memes to be made.
---
Yeah the mage has to be afk for this to work
---
Agreed, but is that not how it is done in retail.  You get out in a shard with other players from other servers.
---
Only starting zones are gonna be sharded and only at launch. That's what I'm understanding from all posts.
---
Do one-button macros work for this in Classic?  My druid in BFA uses one that changes form based on whether I'm inside, outside, combat status, and my current form.
---
I can't help agreeing with you. I've been reading this board since the very beginning in 2017 (when Classic was announced), and the quality of communication decreased significantly. I'm not talking about informative posts (they were rare back then, they are rare nowadays), more like the overall ambience. It seems like r/classicwow became an unholy hybrid of r/wowservers and r/gaming, and the more people are subscribed, the more meaningless it becomes.
---
Truth be told I have zero interest in retail nowadays and I wish I could buy it for a onetime fee.
---
Will take off days for launch and have some back up plans if login is impossible, such as going to the gym or having an event lined up.
---
Makes sense
---
never played retail so i didn't even know that was a thing
---
Dwarves can be rogues. 
---
Additionally, all three races can be hunters, which are the biggest dicks in the game.
---
They're taking so long to release it there's nothing left to talk about.
---
Memes &gt; 'what happens after naxx'.
---
I don't know how much content you can actually clear with a full meme spec raid and I don't think anyone has ever tried it. My ex-GM on a private server toyed around on a Moonkin for a while but never played it past BWL.
---
Anyway I don't think the point here is whether you can clear certain content or not, but rather are you going to have a 1-2 hour MC run or a 5-6 hour MC run. 
---
Unless there's some next level bonding / friendship going on in a guild, I don't see most players who are playing "proper" specs stick around in guilds that run multiple meme specs in a raid because those players will just move to another guild that clears content faster without sacrificing anything for it.
---
It quickly becomes a spiral where a meme spec guild will only be able to recruit meme specs because no one else wants to play with a raid comp like that, and there will be a wall at some point where a guild like that will have to bench some of those players in order to progress through the harder raids.. But are they going to be able to recruit "proper" specs to carry half of the raid is another question when there will probably be guilds that just run regular class / spec raid teams and clear &amp; progress faster, so I'm trying to imagine what there would be to gain by joining a meme spec guild for a regular player.
---
aoe farm, profession farm, sell food/water, sell teleports
---
Aoe farm what exactly
---
Ah. Well... they can't put anything on the internet that isn't true, so...
---
Good luck then
---
Now I want a printer.
---
I'm hoping for sharding at the start, and after a month or two when numbers calm down they will start removing sharing so we have a genuine community feel to each server.
---
I'm against sharding personally but after seeing Azmonbold trying to level without sharding, it was just absurd due to mob respawn, drop rate etc.
---
So in this case I'm all for it, hoping it's only for a month or two  *fingers crossed*
---
I assume PvP server like every other hardcore guild but you might want to specify
---
&gt; Dwarves can be rogues.
---
Damn you're right, I don't think I've ever seen one lol
---
Because we've run out of shit to talk about. There's only so much a group of people can talk about pertaining a certain subject before we start getting bored and making shit up.
---
I think the simplest solution here is to require flairing memes as memes, and being able to filter them out. Personally, I don’t really mind them. I try to make discussion posts here one or two times a week, since I’m still buzzing the hype right now. The front page being drowned with a lot of obvious low hanging memes isn’t ideal, but there’s always a few decent ones. 
---
Now that I think about it, most of the discussion here is speculative, right? What will X be, will Y be in the game, does J Allen Brack hate Z? After release, I think this sub might be even more frontloaded with memes. I guess we will have our game then though, and won’t feel the need to check in so often :)
---
I really want to watch this video now if you find it
---
You can't get your bf to roll horde, meanwhile I can't get my gf to play wow classic to begin with 😭 
---
Then again, it might be for the better, as we're very different when it comes to gaming. She's more relaxed and casual, doesn't care about competition etc.. While I can't stop thinking about how to get to 60 asap. 
---
Maybe you and your bf also aren't meant to play together. That's perfectly fine. If your relationship can't survive if you cannot play games together it's not gonna last anyway. Hard words I know, but it's true. I saw so many relationships being mostly based on playing together, and I am yet to see one that lasted once they wanted to play different games.
---
I'm too lazy to find a reference at the moment, but it won't be cross server. They've said it will just be starting zones and just at launch to mitigate the initial zerg. 
---
They haven't clarified which zones count as 'starter' or how long they plan to implement it. Anything more than that (or even just that possibly) would ruin the whole community vibe.
---
You're confusing CRZ (Cross Realm Zones) with Sharding.    
---
Sharding **is** server based. At a threshold it splits a very high populated zone into 2 zones with even players all from the same realm. When the population goes back down it merges them back into one shard. Basically it means zones have a max pop of 100 characters of whatever, and if there's 101 characters it splits into two with 50 pop each. Once the total population accross shards is back down to 99 it merges back everyone into the one shard again.  
---
    
---
So no, with sharding you never see players from other realms. That's CRZ, a modern WoW tech that means very low population zones dynamically merge with others from different servers so you end up with many players from different servers in the one zone so it doesn't feel empty.  
---
No one has suggested at any time CRZ will be in Classic. Sharding will *probably* be in the starting zones because it deals with the problem of gameplay collapsing under huge amounts of lowbie tourists that will check out the game in the first few weeks overpopulating starting zones but won't make it past lvl 20.

Hi, I agree with you. I like reading peoples stories about WoW vanilla, their lives back then, their hopes and goals for the new game and in general exploring the possibilities. These memes are garbage. There’s maybe 10-20 templates and a reference to WoW classic thats not really nuanced or specific. It makes me wonder if the meme authors even play WoW or they are karma farmers. My friend plays a lot of OSRS and he says their subreddit is the saturated with trash memes from karma farmers. Another thing to note is that these are not even WoW memes. As I mentioned the content is surface level. Example ‘hunter weapon’, ‘release date’, ‘class stereotype’. This basic information, that even non wow gamers have stumbled across is tacked onto meme templates which have nothing to do with WoW. So in essense its content from outside the wow universe driving this. I get that replication + mutation is how memes work, and I like funny memes too, but this is just garbage for scrubs. The fact they get upvoted is so sad.
---
Not sure what you mean - your text is a bit... "grainy"
---
Right, though Ion said, at Blizzcon, that they know sharding is “antithetical” to Classic. So, if they use it, the goal will be to help the bottleneck rush of people in the first zone, for example. Having people from other servers defeats that purpose, and they would never do that. Classic isn’t even built to handle that kind of thing.
---
I really complain on every thread that we need an estimated release date.. I need to take off from work and have to give them tons of notice.  If they were to come out and say.. Yeah Classic comes out next week I'm screwed. I got two weeks paid lingering and I want to use it on Classic.. Come on Blizz.. Just a hint of a date.. Give us the month I'll roll the dice!
---
Classic doesn't cost a one time fee. They will market it like this:
---
hey check out our new content for retail and oh by the way with each subscription you also get free access to this classic game play now!
---
Someone is ready to roll..
---
I'm right there with ya. I like Undead aesthetics but want to be somewhat unique, and I think Orc has better racials.

Diremaul is a Dungeon(s) that is coming in Phase 2 of classic, it is split into 3 zones. Diremaul West, Diremaul East, and Diremaul North. Diremaul North is a popular spot to farm gold solo as a Hunter although it probably wont be a thing in Classic. It is also a spot where mages farm gold and IMO is the best amount of gold farming until ZG is a thing in which you need to be a mage anyway to farm that. Look up youtube videos for "Diremaul North Hunter/Mage" and you should be able to find it easy enough.
---
Diremaul East is a common place for a single DPS or Tank and a Healer go to farm gold as duos. One of you should have herbalism while the other has mining. It has Dreamfoil and Ghost Mushrooms inside the instance which sell nicely along with Rich Thorium Veins. Also, having someone with enchanting is a decent thing as well because you can DE the blues that sell for less than the market value of Large Brilliant Shards. Essentially what you want to do is to enter the instance and skip any large packs and you are able to duo the bosses. Look "DM East Jump Runs" and you should be able to find something easily enough. You do not have to be geared out the ass to be able to do this. Id say 80% preraid BIS on both characters is more than enough (this preraid BIS including the DM gear). 
---
Lastly, you can solo DM East by doing what is called "Lasher Farming". You can do it easily as pretty much any class but its easiest with classes that have AOE. These lashers sell decent greys that vendor for a fair amount as well as drop herbs.
---
You can’t dispel priest fear in vanilla
---
if you are in a good guild, and you know how to play your character by raiding time, then you're DPS is fine. 
---
I raided with a good end raiding guild back in vanilla, and was always near the top of damage meters and never once was excluded from raids. We'd regularly have 3-4 hunters in the raid.  Its all about learning your rotations to max your DPS. Also, ensure you have the right pots/elixers for raiding. 
---
For PVP, hunters were great. There is always a rock/paper/scissors in PVP, but hunters can do well as you have a pet, which can cause a lot of damage as you are trying to get to range. Practice the bounce shot...cos you can kite players using it....you have frost traps and conc shot to slow folk, and kite them.  Look at this week guide below . (its great for leveling too, as you can solo most elite quests/mobs. 
---

---
You role against warriors, druids, rogues and shammies for gear. All can use good leather pcs with agi/stam when leveling. Also weapons, as warriors and rogues can also equip a gun/bow as a stat stick if it has agi/stam. Most guilds have rules on this though, so not really an issue unless you are pugging a lot. 
---
Leveling - do skinning, as you kill so many mobs getting to 60 and can make a pretty penny. LWing is good too as you can make some good gear. In vanilla, the black dragonscale stuff was brilliant for FR gear in MC and BWL. You can grind your own kit and make others to sell for a pretty penny. 
---
I loved playing a hunter as there was very little down time when leveling, you could have a great tanking pet (AOE - Gorilla) or Turtle - (shield shell), and you had Feign Death...so aggro was no issue. You could complete most elite quests on your own, you can also solo a lot of lower level dungeons, which is good for gold/cloth/greens to DE, all to make money for your epic mount.  
---
Basically its a good class to play easily, and a great class to play well.
---
I've seen... once in a blue moon. They're not very popular.
---
Thank you for clarifying the two!
---
i did a resto druid over the course of a weekend
---
To be fair, when it's not low effort memes it's either "what class should I play", "talk me out of X", "Hey I made a BiS lists website based on 4 years old Nostalrius lists that are completely wrong" or "Okay, Ret Pal/Nelf Priest is bad, but how bad is it really?". 
---
There are barely any relevant discussions going on in this subreddit and most people talk out of their butt or repeat some bullshit they heard from a clueless "Classic YouTuber" that never played vanilla.
---
If you want to talk about something in-depth I suggest you make your own thread or join a decent Discord server.
---
In Norway, it is 17.28 metric millidays. Old rule regarding viking bacteria.
---
I think it's because they re-created the original game on the current game client? I don't know much about these sorts of things, but I'm hearing that it uses an entirely different code. I'm guessing this means that literally every component of the game needs to be tested to ensure it works as intended.
---
And also them orc shoulders to show off tier sets. Hmm...
---
Maybe slightly off topic here, but I always thought the concept of trying dungeons when you *severely* underlevel them was cool. Like, it’s okay to funnel enchants and gear to your toon (or maybe not idk) but you have to be the lowest lvl grp to run Deadmines on week 1 for example. Or SFK on week 2. You can find 4 buddies and decide for yourself what level you think will be the lowest possible. Maybe you think 18 is doable and nobody could beat that, and maybe you’d be wrong. Or maybe, it’s s still just too hard at 18 and have to try 20.
---
if the massive damage you're talking about is improved weapon totems and improved str of earth, they seem vastly better than they are.
---
Str of earth provides 18 extra AP (before AQ20 book, 22 AP afterwards)
---
Improved weapon totems gives you a bonus 400 AP rather than 315 on your windfury proc'd attack.
---
All in all these talents together increase average DPS of about 10, it's not accidental it's called strength of earth and windfury totem which are like viagra to warriors, the talents for them though are nigh-inconsequential.
---
As for why you were turned away, personally I much prefer Nightfall on hunters or off tanks, perhaps the RL had the same idea.
---
Gotchya, understood. Thanks!
---
Some companies can pay you ridiculous money basically just for having a cert, because it can allow them to charge more and enter more beneficial partnerships where specific cert quotas have to be met. 
---
So certs are definitely not only good in the beginning, and can be an income booster greater than the actual salary in the right circumstances.
---
Oh man. I hope they release the client long before they open the servers. I don't want to wait 3 weeks just to complete a downloaded version.
---
At level 6 you can get the best (I think) 2H weapon for that level that will last you for many levels at the Amberstill Ranch as a reward for [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=314/protecting-the-herd) quest. Don't waste money on white weapons.
---
For pvp always engineering. The effort of 18 slot bags is not worth it, rather level an alt for it, if you wanna do also pve, skill tailoring for the robe of strat life, craft it, and drop it again. To me alchemy doesn‘t give you much, there is always someone who can do it for you in the guild 😄
---
I don’t know how Torvald manages to make his pursuit of Brienne so cute and funny instead of creepy. 
---
Is it because he’s so unabashed? Is it because Brienne isn’t a classical beauty in the context of the GoT universe? 
---
It totally works and everyone including myself loves it but I don’t know why.

We founded Đark Moon Templars on a few servers. I think the most successful version was on Crushridge, especially after the big split where lots of us moved to the new Oceanic realms
---
Cool thx, i didnt really remember a lot of Horde guilds from Shadowsong but i remember Stinkfoot the tauren warrior from PVP for sure.
---
Its gonna be good to be back brother.
---
OMG TIME TRAVEL YAY
---
Yeah I always enjoyed doing 5 mans with a group at just the right level where it was tough but doable. I always found it so annoying when you're looking for a 4th or 5th member and someone helpfully gets a high level guildie to run you through, like they're doing you some massive favour trivialising the gameplay. I'm like yeah thanks. Now i just stare at my screen and loot things for 30 mins woooo...
---
Yep most of the datas been extracted, most of the discussions already occured, except for new people retelling their wow stories and its influence on their friends and lives: Also, seeing it all as a repeat says more about you being really knowledgeable on the game and this subreddit, because there is a lot of data. Compared to the memes which is limited to the lowest common denominator. Also memories are unique, sure a time or experience may be similiar but not the same.
---
Also your second paragraph is whack, 1000s of memes vs a few complaints. His solution is also fine, but people upvoting memes is the problem, so maybe anti memers are wrong
---
I know you're sorry. Now appologize! &gt;: D
---
I totally agree! Sad to see. Some people keep the sub fresh with decent content, though.
---
D=
---
You can't trade tokens (not even between people on retail) you can only trade gold (and other ingame items), then what you buy with that gold is another matter.
---
As long as trading gold is allowed there's no purpose is "imagining" it will be forbidden.
---
The purpose of the token is to get 20$ for each sub instead of 15, they already have that on retail. Adding the token to Classic would mean setting up a dedicated infrastructure for it, it's a huge cost with no returns (they already have their returns on retail), it doesn't make sense from a business perspective.
---
Didnt know that. But its easy for you to find dungeon groups. Maybe Tank for Gold then 😂
---
Lmfaoo
---
Leveling is the most boring shit ever. There is no exploration. Everyone has been through the same areas for a hundred times.
---
 Tens of YouTube videos about "vanilla secrets".
---
With friends sure, fun. But I know I am getting that addon.
---
Using staff of jordan to level faster is a waste of staff of jordan.
---
If I see a level 23 rogue with assassination blade I'll see that as wasted.
---
If for example staff of jordan is worth 200gold. You could have spended that 200 gold on the AH on diffrent items for even bigger upgrates. He could have upgrated all his greenies to a current level greenie with the right stats for a bigger power upgrade than the staff was.
---
&lt;Order Of Elune&gt; - Turalyon EU!

Good times.

Awesome, I greatly appreciate the reply.  Got an AS in Network Systems and working towards a CCNA but I’m going very slow.  Been picking up more steam though!
---
Thank you so much again!
---
Have you tried doing this quest? The mob 2 or 3 shots level 10s
---
INT Buff is actually useful as a warrior while leveling. Because INT increases your weapon skill increase rate. And as a warrior you're not going to walk around with INT gear for that reason. So a Buff is nice.
---
Is this a porn intro?
---
I see raids turning into speed runs like back in TBC. Soon we'll see naxx guilds with world buffs going into mc
---
Oh damn!! A laptop does sound appealing i want one too now hummmmmm
---
"Aw shit, here we go again"
---
...sorry, couldn't resist.
---
But yeah, this entire meme-culture makes you feel (Even more) old as shit lol.
---
I farmed my juju's,I got the mongoose, I got the rage potions. I have 2 flask of the titans, got the roids food, snagged DM buffs and songflower. And Johnny Thundercock just respecced enhancement because he likes to PvP as well.
---
We're not being childish, we're asking for the same effort to be put in as we ourselves do. If you don't want to that's by all means fine, exceedingly rarely does someone say "If you play a hybrid DPS I fucking hate your guts and shoot a voodoo doll effigy in the dick with a nail gun 3 times a day to make sure you're justly punished for playing a hybrid DPS".
---
What do you hear rather often however, is the reasonable approach of "Play whatever you would like, but I wont play with you."
---
Stalking is always funny if the one doing the stalking is handsome and funny and the stalked person is ugly.
---
If the roles are reverse though, its creepy.
---
I dont make the rules.
---
...his joke was that a dwarf is short - or was that... over your head... ;-P
---
They will market it and it's a known game. They don't need to market it as much as a new game.
---
I met my husband in vanilla (in private server )
---
i didn't realize the percentual difference between 250 and 1000 was 1. Interesting.
---
My friends want to play alliance and this is the main reason i'm probably not going to join them.
---
I completely agree. I joined this sun Reddit at around 10k members and the content has vastly changed.
---
But we now are in a strange period where summer is around the corner, we have all discussed really what we wanted, and we are now impatiently waiting for the release date. Which is what most of the memes are about.
---
We'll get good chat going again when the release date is made.
---
Then we'll moan about no servers names and, upon release, moan about too many players, server performance, blah blah, so the circle continues
---
Blizz underestimating how many people are kind and want to be helpful. One of the main reasons why I wanna play Classic and help others ingame,when I get free time ingame.Great feeling:)
---
(it's the beards)
---
You can farm gold with professions like herbalism and fishing
---
Oh I see... I missed the classic boat and didn't come to the game until BC era. I just remember seeing posts about shammy only horde troll and pally only human ally.
---
You always were so full of thoughts, elan.
---
Give us something to talk about then, old man.
---
The reason is clearing MC BWL and AQ your one raid night, and Naxx the other, rather than spend 4 hours in MC one night, 4 hours in BWL the next, and an additional two raid nights wiping on Twins.
---
As keeps being repeated, most of us are adults these days and would like to be efficient with our time management, short effective raids play a huge part.
---
Praise the sun.
---
At least "memes" can be somewhat original.
---
&gt;What if the way sharding worked was server based only. So, say you have so many people in the barrens, itll shard some of those people to another instance but it's only people from the same server. 
---
That is exactly how it works.
---
Yeah but he kinda just spoiled a major plot point for you
---
Had a few, but it was mainly Te Kaha in Vanilla and through to BC. In BC it was Epitaph on Caelestrasz.
---
&lt;Ruin&gt;, &lt;Archaic Requiem&gt;, and &lt;Civilian&gt; which reformed into &lt;Status Quo&gt;
---
I see, so do you not choose who to buy the token from? Is it just a "buy a token" button and whoever is next in the queue sells it for a fixed price? That kills that worry then, I guess.
---
My feeling on Blizzard stopping these practices is more to do with keeping the good will they've been generating in the Classic community. I think by now they're aware that anything seen as remotely against the "spirit of classic" would poison the well, so to speak, and that includes letting people make backdoor trades between games to get advantages. Even if it's not token-for-gold, I can see classicgold-for-retailgold being against the ToS for that reason. Could be way off base here.
---
Yeah!  Another person explained I was confusing sharding and cross realm zones!
---
&gt; Also your second paragraph is whack, 1000s of memes vs a few complaints.
---
It's not just 1000s of memes though. It's:
---
Most Memorable Item Thread #56
---
What Changes Would You Make? Thread #450
---
Cat Druids Are Viable Because I Saw This Video With Two Bosses Thread #64
---
This Board Is All Memes Now Thread #33
---
Take This Classic WoW Survey Thread #120
---
It doesn't matter what gets posted. It's all recycled, it's all tired.
---
&gt; His solution is also fine
---
His solution is to the problem of 'too many memes, not enough discussion' but offers no example of a discussion we should be having that hasn't already been had.
---
We're at the point that we can get away with just copy/pasting previous comments into new threads.
---
The problem is the game isn't out yet, so we're out of stuff to talk about. When that happens you get more memes. The solution is to release the game, not kill the board. When the game comes out, we'll have tons of posts of new experiences, loot drops, pvp shenanigans, pve kills, etc.
---
Just blow the CD before the fight then.
---
Check out Skarm's videos in youtube. He goes over all kinds of questions regarding tanking in Classic whether it be warrior, druid or even paladin.
---
A much better use of the rogue in AV. Rogues can stealth cap defended points by utilizing vanish, blind, and sap. Around Cata I was able to stealth cap points defended by 2 defenders with the defenders having trinket.  I did this almost every battleground and single handedly won almost every match of AV.
---
Improved windfury totems provide extra 20% (or so) effect over normal windfury.
---
I never had issues finding groups as a warrior in Vanilla. In raiding as well, if you werent main/off tank, you primarily DPS until fights with a lot of targets to tank. Then some of the warriors would tank until their target is dead. Warriors do have ways to farm gold if you know where to look. I farmed my epic mount and had lots more gold on mine, you just need to figure out ways.
---
Engineering is probably the cheapest main profession to level.
---
But it sounds like PVE is your end goal so Alcy is obviously gonna save you money in the longer run for consumables.
---
Thats why you try to avoind joining servers with major streamers at all costs
---
Money selling portals! So easy
---
Happened on every expansion release, there's no reason why it won't happen on classic. :( Streamers ruin everything.
---
It's the problem with having a voting system determine which content is "good" or "bad." Memes are generally inoffensive so they're easy to upvote. If you try to create an actual discussion you're a lot more likely to get flooded with downvotes from people just because they disagree with you.
---
Do you know what "Cultural Appropriation" is?  
---
Because this is exactly what it looks like. Congratulations, you're both illiterate and ignorant.
---
What is wrong?
---
Can you imagine the disrespect it would be if a ret paladin got Thunderfury before anyone else in a guild? I wonder how many people would gquit over it.
---
There are good sword, mace and dagger tanking weapons, almost no axes. Also the most important part about threat is the first 10s on most encounters.
---
Troll tank is superior to orc tank, BIS weapons won‘t be axes for tanking, bloodfury is useless as tank in general.
---
Upvoting your thread so people can read the comments. I want less memes and more game-related threads too, but enjoy the memes till the game is released.
---
How do you wakk up-right and shift at the same time?
---
Just do us a favor and if it's a lousy meme, take a half-second to downvote before you scroll so maybe the rest of us won't have to see it.  
---
I'll do the same.
---
Yep.
---
The same twitter image macros being reposted with "me" and "my x" "my x".
---
SWTOR handles this in a (relatively) good way, where new instances/shards appear as the population rises, but you can switch between them manually. So if population hits 100, you might have one shard with 90 and one with 10 - so it kind of accomodates both those who love the crowds and those who enjoy a more solitary experience.
---
I agree there's too much memes right now. But I also feel there's not much to discuss about, just the same topics over and over again unless it's a new blue post and/or information. Maybe the meme' could be controlled a bit anyway? They are easily abused with ton of upvotes and any discussion get's lost on the mainpage.
---
Robe and pants are crafted BiS, and the robe is only replaced by T2, yep.
---
The majority of hunter BiS is leather.
---
Ok, hold on - everyone on this thread is saying "we've already discussed everything to discuss" but wait...  
---
What we need...  
---
BiS GREY ITEMS CHARTS FOR EVERY LEVEL/CLASS!!!!!!
---
It provides what I wrote above, 95 extra AP on the windfury attack.
---
Normal AP bonus from WF: 315x0,3= 94,5 Imp wf now gives 400 AP.
---
Then keep in mind that said windfury attack can miss or be dodged and it drops even further.
---
Just like the improved cleave talent it looks amazing (Zomg 120% increased damage!?) but in actuality it really doesn't do much, since it's a flat AP increase it scales very poorly with gear, and averages out to about a 6 DPS increase, the improved str of earth puts the total value at about an extra 10 DPS.
---
Nah. Not only does he slay the horde, he denies them cool horde names too.
---
you also have 15 moonkins dancing because they are oom 20 seconds into the fight. win win situation if you ask me.
---
Yes its possible u simply go to your profession tab and press the button to unlearn. After that you get it freed up. However it doesnt work for sub-specialisations such as Elemental and Tribal if u wanted to switch from elemental to tribal u have to start from 0 in leatherworking
---
In lack of new information people resort to barbarous behaviour.
---
Alexstrasza?
---
&gt;so we're out of stuff to talk about
---
Kinda like all relationships.......badum tss!
---
&lt;Ari Scara&gt; Earthen Ring EU, Horde
---
It was patched out later so that Hakkar wouldn't use Blood Fury on mind controlled Orcs anyhow, but in general the two min CD would be back well before the boss died back then.
---
Instead of sharding you would need like a group of servers that share name rules and thus can be easily merged a few weeks in. The problem with sharding is that the people you play with or againsy isn't fixed, it's not always the same ones. And THAT is what people really want to experience.
---
In barren you already have the famous chat, wailing caverns, ganking etc.
---
I've seen in lineage 2 back in the day a new server starting. Many people start over on the new one, and without sharding. You have indeed about 10 people per mob which resulted in immidiate pvp. I expect some good battles in ratchet as we did back in beta as well.
---
If we can't have it the perfect way, I rather be over populated for all in all a short time (level both your main and alt(s) to 12 then before continuing) than take away the first moments of community creation when people need to group up for dungeons and or pvp
---
Main things that come to mind are the farms/crypts in WPL. There are plenty of guides on what mobs to farm and what to expect from killing them.
---
To list a few as well for single target or potentially AOE
---
Water Elementals in wpl/felwood farming essence of water
---
Fire Elementals in arathi/ungoro/searing gorge for elemental fire
---
Earth Elementals in Silithus for Elemental earth
---
Satyrs in Azshara/felwood for felcloth
---
Various beasts in blasted lands for their assorted meats for the repeatable quest turn in (gives a stat buff for raiders)
---
Devilsaur in ungoro for devilsaur leather (prepare to do pvp)
---
Those just come off the top of my head, just utilize the wonderful tool of google and you will find a plethora of different spots to grind.
---
Nope, you're stuck with what you chose. Changing wasn't introduced until TBC I believe.
---
Pretty sure I heard that there wouldn't be a physical collector's edition for Classic, think I heard that from a QnA stream, but I might wrong. They might have said that they haven't decided yet, can't recall.
---
I laughed way to hard at this
---
Well when that happens you just have more sex to keep the relationship healthy.
---
I'm not sure if I want to bang most of the people on this subreddit, but I'm willing to give it a shot.
---
Probably.  But I doubt it would cc him and even so a 5 second window is really pushing it.
---
If we solely talked about news from what we know from a 15 year old game when it releases this whole subforum would have about 9 posts.
---
Whatever there is to talk about is been discussed as nauseum since 2004.
---
If you don't like something then don't engage in it. There's no harm in a few memes.
---
Go home, dad.
---
Haven't run into someone like that since TBC
---
Friend, I had a hunter take Core Hound Tooth and Perdition's Blade from me in MC. I was a dagger rogue.
---
Perdition's Blade doesn't even have stats. What the hell.
---
Getting that hearth stone kicked every time
---
I've found that if you have that one person griefing the party, or a newish player making dumb mistakes threatens to break up the group, simply handing out a few low stacks of these kinds of items can really help keep things together...
---
This wasnt possible in vanilla - book "Soothsaying for Dummies" wasnt added untill TBC. You have to unlearn the profession entirely and level it all over if you wish to get a new spec.
---
I don't have anything to offer you, but I too miss the art of the written guide.
---
They’re still marketing BfA. They won’t dilute the player base like that. As soon as they’ve finished the content release for BfA they’ll ramp on classic.
---
This is so me, glad i took 4 days vacation on easter To sleep so now i can rrfresh them pages again
---
He’s not really stalking though. It’s not like he’s following her home without her awareness and invading her privacy, so I don’t think this is a good assessment. 
---
It’s a pursuit, but not stalking.
---
Exactly same feels here my dude!!! I remember a friendly guy gave me 1g. So I went off into the might of SW then through deeprun tram with him to find someone to enchants my green bastard sword. What a day to be alive!
---
But you aren't efficient if you farm for an or two hour for every raid just to respec so you can be 10% more efficient.
---
You don't have to drag pet abilities to the bar to bind them btw. There's a dedicated list for them already. Pet attack is already bound to ctrl-1 for example, follow ctrl-2, stay ctrl-3 and so forth.
---
Looks like another plug for YouTube content creators.

I've done this quest in a group of 5 yes

So it is possible.

1: Dwarves are an honorable race.  
---
2: Dwarves cannot be thieves.  
---
3: Rogues ARE thieves.  
---
4: There is no honor among thieves.  
---
So, if a Dwarf must be honorable, can he TRULY be a Rogue??
---
Yes, vanilla raids are mechanically really easy, because they were pretty much pioneers in that regard.
---
I've recently started to raid in WoW vanilla, and after a decade's worth of MMO gameplay I can safely say the raids I've been and read about in are really simple (ZG, AQ20, Ony, MC, BWL).  Even without any preparations I could go in and instantly understand what I must do because there are one one or two mechanics per boss.
---
The very first boss on the very first raid in GW2 had more mechanics than a whole raid in Vanilla.
---
Ofc the pure standard combat mechanics could be tricky (like boss dealing too much damage, healers going OOM, etc) but that is also not true with the 1.12 talents we have.
---
I know that people need to get paid but YouTube is frankly an awful reference for class guides, I can’t stand it.
---
I rember CoI, tho i joined Shadowsong in BC, raided with Hive all the way to sunwell.
---
...nobody wants to hear about your bubblehearth repair bill
---
Ye well, if you want to level your profession all over, sure.
---
I read your post as if you were asking if its possible to unlearn profession spec alone. My bad :P
---
DWARFS, NOT DWARVES
---
Holy shit, I scanned the original image, read this comment, went back to the image and then realised the exact same had happened to me. Damn, that image is law.
---
#Inspiration #Goals
---
This post doesn’t add to the quality of the subreddit any more than shitty memes do.
---
No, just buy them off AH rly, it's not that expensive.

Healing dungeons in vanilla and retail is very different. In vanilla, healing was all about triage and not wasting mana. You only had enough mana for a couple of spells until you went OOM. If a mage isn't going to die you don't have to heal him to full during a trash fight. The mage can eat after the pull while you drink up.
---
This changed drastically with TBC heroics where healing changed from triage to just spam the fuck out of the highest HPS spell because otherwise everyone would be dead. Mana was no longer a resource but just... an annoying blue bar...
---
Holy Paladin is what you're looking for. They have multiple "oh shit" spells that make them frustrating to deal with and can support any DPS through blessings and auras. Paladin is simple to learn, but are very gear dependent, and most Plate gear is shit until AQ and Naxx.
---
Druids can be good but it's a lot of micromanagement between forms and fights can sour quickly if you aren't clutch. I dont personally remember struggling with Druids during vanilla, other than catching up to them in WSG. 
---
I'd make a case for Resto/Elemental Shaman but I'm sure most would disagree. I think Windfury, Grounding, Tremor, and Earthbind are extremely valuable in a premade setting, but Shaman survivability and mana efficiency are seen as a negative. With this class, the best defense is a good offense. 
---
Whatever you choose, get good at fake casting and line of sight dodging. These are concepts that every caster has to learn, but as a healer these will keep you from wasting cooldowns on yourself.
---
&gt;Uhm, thats nonsense. This isnt retail. You need to progress through the raids no matter what the latest content is. MC gear will be interesting for people doing BWL.
---
It's not really that black and white. Take a look at druid resto [gear table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#)
---
Notice how on almost every slot there is a better alternative to what MC drops in the 20mans. Exceptions are shoulder and pantsSometimes even random greens and blues from AH are stronger (like the abyssal 'set'). These gear and the 20 man raids were specifically made to be 'catch-up' mechanic that allows you pretty much skip MC in terms of gear you want to acquire. You obviously wanna do it still if you have the time.
---
I work for the company who builds the fuselages for the planes he flies. If you think his training being unorganized is unbelievable... haha! You'd never believe your eyes in the shop.
---
shoud have followed the guild name and you would have made some bank =D
---
People can do that any week or weekend of their live, that doesn't require vacation time anymore than wow does.
---
I tried that sometimes in the earlier levels and found it not efficient. Especially on melee mobs it can be great, if it's working. You will want to cast shadow bolts to let the threat jump between you and your imp and shadow bolts are not mana-efficient compared to dots, so it's taking much longer imo.
---
If using dots, it's not that easy to estimate the generated threat, even with threat meters, so blueberry is my choice.
---
That's irrelevant when both dalrends and bone slicing gets it..
---
I am really curious how sharding will work out, will it actually be possible to level up on a starting zone on launch or do you have to do some explore xp shenanigans.
---
Been playing a healer and using the naga buttons to heal, havent had any problems in my mouse hand after i got a mousepad that has the wrist support. Previously had few times that i had serious problems with my mouse hand, aka i couldnt really play at all (im old). None of these problems were linked to my thumb.
---
IMO the thumb is MUCH more resilient than your other fingers. I dont like having my heals in keyboard button, since when im on the move and stop, i want to have the first heal to be casted instantly and i cant get that with keyboard buttons.
---
On a DPS class that has a lot of spam button thingys, i bind those to mouse up and down. Healing isnt that bad after that initial cast, then you are pressing the buttons like every 1-3s. And i do sometimes just spam them anyways. If there is any pain, its always my index and middle fingers.
---
Indeed you're not from a personal view, so you make the choice of which spec you want to play and stick to it. If that isn't the optimal PvE raid spec then that's completely fine all the power to you, but I don't want you in my raids.
---
Also 10% is a fair downplayment.
---
Except for voidwalker books.
---
You overrated it. It's not retail anymore, my friend. Starfire has full 3 seconds, and global cooldown is full 1.5 second. No haste, no casttime nerf.
---
There is a difference between having a moonkin instead of a mage and having a MotW/NS druid as healer instead of a Moonglow one. I've seen guilds that didn't let you heal in low tier raids as MotW, even though it is marginally worse than moonglow (you lose 10% healing, 9% mana reduction, occasional cast reduction but gain 20% intellect, not a horrible tradeoff)
---
You are going to have to put the money in a mail and post it directly to Blizzard HQ.
---
Is this coincidence, or were you planning on buying a new printer *yesterday* as well?
---
Little do we all know that friendly guy was dying inside and the only thing that kept him on the edge of sanity was his desire to do good for others wherever he could, including the world of warcraft.

Making dalrends BiS for an entire phase. though that depends how blizzard decides to do itemization. Also when the 15 Agi enchant comes in game, dal'rends will be BiS again. Orginally the enchant came with BWL, so Dal'rends is BiS again from phase 3 to 4. 
---
I think it's fair to take an item that's literally BiS(well ignoring MC sword/daggers that melee will never let you have) for 2 phases over someone taking it for prebis.
---
If only there was a way to search the internet...
---
Guilds have been speedrunning vanilla raids for years on private servers. I dunno how big or popular it will be, but it will be a thing in Classic 100%.
---
We should close down this forum then since all information can be found elsewhere.
---
I'm now tied down to the last week of July continuing 3 weeks into August.
---
I think that should be the sweetspot, but knowing my luck launch will be the day i'm back at work.
---
&lt;/3
---
It's because all content, that is not caption meme, is removed by the moderators.
---
And, if your content gets removed, you have a 1% chance to win the ban lottery.
---
Ban can be either 3 days (60% chance), 7 days (30% chance) or 30 days (10% chance)
---
The reason will be some came-up-with rule that's not officially listed, such as "no googleable pictures".
---
And, if you really break the rules, you probably get permban.
---
People overrate skinning hard.  It won't help you get a 40 mount. 
---
What it will help you with, is getting extra gold at 60, because skinning really starts taking off around 40-60.
---
Because frost and fire dichotomy was thought up by Martin only, nobody else in the world

Awh man, I was so sad when I couldn't click on RP-PvP.....

But where else would we post all the memes?

---
&gt;Do you think Blizzard might end up adding more items for things like Feral Druids, etc?
---
&gt;Maybe I'm not seeing the whole picture, can someone explain to me why this would be a bad idea?
---
What other people said. We are just recreating vanilla here, not trying to design the optimal game. 
---
If you are disappointed in this, maybe look at it this way instead: Each *class* has a role in vanilla raiding, you are either a tank, healer, or DPS. Specs are then added on top of that already existing assumption. The specs allow you to either increase the effectiveness of your role, or do weird things and "hybridise" so to speak, which has a lot of uses in PvP for example, and is a lot of fun while levelling. But you are not meant to suddenly become a full fledged raid DPS as a druid just by switching a few talents. And most druid gear is made for healing, because that's what role your class is supposed to fulfill. 
---
Anyway, the lack of off-spec gear is only really a problem in early raids. Before raiding, and in later raids there is stuff for everyone pretty much. Just a lot of off-specs are not very good, but they were not necessarily intended to be great, just fun alternatives.
---
I actually had someone PM me to stop once, I was like "what's up?" - fully expecting them to open trade to CoD an item, start a duel, or ask for help with a tough quest/directions... nope, boom I'm healed up and buffed. Them: "that's all!" and they run off... made my whole day better.

[Enemy Mine cliche on tvtropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/EnemyMine/VideoGames)

The problem is there really is not anything relevant to discuss. It should get better after they release beta and we get to test things again.
---
I had a horde warrior do that. Then ganked me after.
---
Just so long as I don't have to argue with another hunter why he should fuck right off of Striker's Mark you're more than welcome to Dal'Rends.
---
It doesn't have to be.
---
If you click on the leveling filter and then you can see a dungeons button appear right below it. Click that and all things will be filtered by dungeons now.
---
Horde: Dilapidated buildings, mud huts and sticks  
---
Alliance: Castles, magic trees and bunkers.
---
I guess you mean non optimized specs? To me it's not the same thing to speak about non viable specs (a spec that works) and optimized specs (for min maxing)
---
Not really. The spawns are maybe 20-40% faster but considering that there's double or triple the population, then it's rather slow.
---
Strikers mark makes no sense for a hunter to get because it's too fast to actually get any use out of.
---
Serious business
---
Any tip over x amount of currency will gain you a free int buff haha
---
I was in almost every horde guild there was on lagfist and outland, being 12 years old and having a "grass is greener" mentality and all that...
---
I guess that means I'm kind of an ass since I have a document similar to his, but with "interim gear" listed in addition to pre-raid?  
---
Crap!
---
But it's a BOW and i'm a HUNTER who uses BOWS as primary weapon and it's epic and better than my current so fuck off it's just a stat stick for you.
---
That's a literal quote.
---
moron = newbie  
---
This is a person you get to help enjoy the game a little better by explaining Stats/Buffs to him/her. Then, one day you hear someone talking on ventrillo (Discord nowadays) and you think "wow she's got a nice voice" and then you find out it's that same "moron" you explained things too all those weeks/months ago...  
---
...how you reacted to their inquiry has left a permanent impression on their perception of who you are as a person.  
---
Did they leave that convo feeling degraded? Or did they leave that convo grateful for a friendly, helpful word of advice from a random stranger?  
---
Your actions had REAL consequences in vanilla, and that's something modern gamers simply do not understand.
---
Because OP doesn't give a shit other than his personal inconvenience.
---
Well, "Classic Summer". I don't recall Blizzard ever doing such things, so that wouldn't be a classic thing.
---
However, I recall having beta, and no actual release date, for a long time, the suddenly beta got shutdown with "next month". That would be a classic Blizzard's move :Ð
---
You are right I wouldn't really even call dps shamy/pally/druid meme specs in the context of dungeons. I think prot pally is probably a step worse than all of them, just because tanking is a very important role in dungeons, whereas really if 1 dps is totally afk it's not the end of the world it just means you go a bit slower and they're really not that different while levelling anyway. Like you say most of the problems are due to longevity (and itemisation) that doesn't really become a big problem until raiding.

I intend on leveling and raiding on a Warrior. 
---
I am looking for a semi-hardcore guild. I have raided in Vanilla and the majority of WoW expacs.
---
In Vanilla I cleared ZQ, AQ20, Ony,  MC, BWL, AQ40 up to C, bloodwing of Naxx. 
---
At the time I had a Resto Druid main and Warrior alt, I am looking to do the opposite this time with Warrior main and Druid alt. 
---
The idea is the Druid will fuel my Warrior with flasks etc via herb/alch.
---
I am looking for a guild planning on raiding a few times a week, maybe more when new raids drop before settling back down.
---
Discord: Nandaiyo#4049 if you want to chat more.
---
desperately want to play a warrior but feel the leveling will destroy me..
---
ideally like a class with the least downtime between mobs..a lot of my play to 60 will be solo..
---
the bluest of balls
---
Yep. I make all my own notes in spreadsheets. The idea of referencing a video for the game is against me.
---
you mean, as COD?
---
And send some copper arrow?
---
HAHA how popular this form of scamming was back then
---
&gt;« I’ve granted you a buff that increases all you stats, armour and resistances. You HP’s are now growing »...
---
If you had read the WHOLE post, you would have slightly noticed the following sentence: " « I’ve granted you a buff that increases all you stats, armour and resistances. You HP’s are now growing »... " That was my positive answer to him...
---
The cheapest? Realy? I might have to look into it bether.
---
Cheers
---
Yes he did thanks for asking
---
Oh yeah, I would do that too. As a tank, I had a lot of opportunities to do this. I saved a LOT of people from serious embarrassment by saying things like "Oh man, I should've used shield wall" or "My taunt was resisted!" or "I always forget about last stand..."  
---
Meanwhile my I'd be staring at a bar with literally everything on CD, messaging the healer/player that messed up and explaining to them how not to wipe us the next time - this actually led to my being promoted to a Guild Master (not my choice) and I had around 20/30 people who raided with me through most of TBC. Those were good times!
---
Not sure about the rest but I think the engineering specs were valid "only" 1 year and you had to renew the membership or something like this.
---
Now you get to hide nearby while they grind/quest and gank would-be gankers!
---
I think they want 8.2 to compete with FF expansion. Looks more likely we will see an August release at this point...
---
Haha, thats awesome. Thats been me with the /duel sometimes too, I love to duel :) just a /wait though at most.
---
You will be more special in Alliance, but are going to have to deal with undeads from the pvp side.
---
Haha, nice - I didn't put that together that way, but that's funny!
---
Personally, I prefer the memes over the « what class should I play, I didn’t even tried to look by myself » posts...
---
But I get your point, the content changed a bit yes
---
I'm fine with it until the game is released. However when the game is released i hope the memes are gone and people focus on guides, server beefs, montages, things like that.
---
Until then i'll tolerate all this meme stuff. Just please dont have the subreddit turn into what some other gaming forums have become - places to post cosplays, shitty memes and "does anyone else" posts.
---
&gt; For the most part it really did just look like the normal game. 
---
So... did you ~~play~~ work with sound on?
---
this will change once the game is out and there is stuff to talk about. 
---
giving the ratio “new information available” to “amount of discussions being lead about those information”, this sub is pretty decent.
---
its the - currentl - lack of information. 
---
id rather enjoy some memes while waiting, then seeing a dying/empty sub.
---
Right... like I wasnt just doing the 5-man for XP and 1/3 a level. I want to enjoy a challenge with the time im spending. Plus, when a higher person helps you out, you dont even get that 1/3 level, it's like a bar if youre lucky.
---
That percentage depends on the class in question. There are some where the PvP or DD spec is completely different then the healer or tank one, for some, the difference truly is 10%.
---
I've seen guilds where every class had to be 100% raid healing oriented, even for low tier raids and for classes where that truly only offers 10% increase in performance.
---
They've said that they're planning to keep the number of realms low. They may reuse some names or they might not.
---
when you get to 20+ i feel like warriors get way more powerful, and if you spend some time going into dungeons and get lucky with a bunch items, warriors can with a lucky crit 2-3 shot certain mobs, with proper gear ofc. But yeah, they can be tough at times as well, i leveled one myself in TBC from 1-70
---
This is why I refuse to re-activate my subscription until the client drops.
---
You are right in a sense that some classes dont necessarily need much from MC once ZG is out (AQ20 gear was pretty underwhelming mostly afaik). However the point was about MC gear becoming irrelevant - which isnt true nonetheless. ZG offering an alternating gearing route doesnt make MC gear any less good for further progressing. It may become less desirable in some cases.
---
It wasn't in Vanilla and it's not a passive. lol
---
waste of paper. all this could be inside a google doc.
---
My boss gave me a deadline, book your vacation by 15:30 tomorrow friday april 26th. Ive never wanted a thursday night release date blue post so hard! 😭
---
Feral is, the others is not
---
Yeah haven't heard a peep since the files went up. Been complete radio silence :(
---
Okay, I think we are on the same page here.
---
I remember a few times when I needed a GM that you could wait for hours and if, at any time, you would relog you got a response telling you "we tried to contact you but you weren't online".
---
That happened two or three times and I know other that had that happen. Was that just bad luck?
---
Vagash is laughing all the way back to the cave.
---
I assume your goal is to minimize damage taken by yourself or your pet. I could be wrong.  
---
Part of what makes warlock so powerful while leveling is that they can regen health and mana in such a balanced way that eventually you're chain pulling mobs without having to drink or eat. It takes awhile at first to get the method down, but eventually you can keep a great balance of both HP and MP.  
---
When I was leveling, I tried to maintain at least 75%+ HP and MP. If MP reached 100%, I considered it to be inefficient/unbalanced.
---
If I can be as obnoxious as to keep arguing, I think it's true what this thread's OP said, the most important part of a 5-man tank is the person controlling the character, not that character's class. On one hand, a pally might never be as good as the most skilled warrior tank on the server. But a paladin who knows their class/their role will still be better than half of the warrior tanks I've played with. On top of that, if somebody is a prot paladin, you know they're already aware of the uphill battle theyre facing, both mechanically and in terms of stigma. 
---
There might be \*some\* mechanics that kind of make it harder, like the rare knockback-threatdrop, or a possible mana drain, but a paladin specd deep into prot is actually built very well for 5 mans, where def cap, taunt, sustainability, and cooldowns are less of a mechanic.
---
Too close to real life now, so sad
---
I don't know, same as any of other fucking day.
---
Was this really worth its own post?
---
You still called him a "moron" =/  
---
Worse, you did it behind his back. Being nice to someone doesn't count if you aren't cool about it later.
---
Oh man, you're behind on all the info ey? I would check out the official forums to catch up a bit. 
---
You don't have to purchase WoW at all to play Classic. Make an account and create a sub, that's it. The game itself doesn't have to be purchased as it's free up to Legion which you'd still have to be subbed to play up to, then you'd still have to buy the latest expansion if you wanted to play it. The sub is a 2 in 1, you're essentially paying for the base game with classic being "free" with it.
---
&gt;  Is it just the original client without addons? 
---
No, simply put they've just moved the base game from the original engine to their newest version of it. It won't be literally 1:1 compared to original vanilla, but it'll be damn close. They've even go as far as to "nerf" the engine in order to recreate the limitations that existed back then for balancing reasons. However, it'll still end up being smoother feeling than original classic either way. Real ID looks like it's gonna be in the game, but from new screenshots it looks like you can block real ID requests if you want to, but you'll be able to see your friends list like in every other battlenet game. A lot will probably rage over real ID in classic, but as I said above it won't be 1:1 by default not just because of the new age, but because of time itself. Everyone's just gonna use discord even if they don't have RID. Any addon that was in original classic that doesn't automate gameplay or introduce features that weren't in vanilla will likely be available, but look more like the modern variants of them.
---
Don't leave the horde! Roll a priest and then a pally when Blizz do legacy TBC... which im praying will happen so i can play a pally on horde.
---
Stage 4 reminds me of Vork from The Guild. So devoted to the game that he has to bum his senile neighbor's wifi from in the shed.
---
Really as long your plan is to take somewhere between 2 weeks and 8 months to get to lvl 60 there's going to be an absolute ton of players in every zone you're levelling in, it's a fresh server of a very popular game. So this idea that you'll have to spend hours grinding solo and skipping hard quests as a warrior doesn't really make any sense. You'll easily be finding groups for all the hard quests, people will desperately want you to tank dungeons for them, and you'll get a ton of free heals/buffs even when you're out questing completely solo.  Absolute worst case you're looking at an extra week or two to get to level 60 compared to a hunter. If you want to play a warrior I say go for it.
---
I hope you at least bought them dinner.
---
I've not had a gaming PC (desk top) since I stopped playing in 2012-2013. I ended up giving it to my brothers wife so they could play together. By 2012-2013, it was already 5-6 yrs old or so, so it wasnt a big loss. 
---
This time, there is no way my wife would accept me sitting on a desk top in the bedroom or even sitting room, ignoring her after the kids are down....at least with a laptop, I can "pretend" to be listening to her ;) 
---
I guess it'll take me 6-8 weeks to get to 60 anyway....and by then I can slowly start to do 5 main-15 mans, without her noticing much issue....then progress to raids a couple nights a week. Thats the plan anyway...haha
---
I wouldn't worry too much about the gear thing. Most of your gear comes from quests while levelling, it's only at lvl 60 when you want to start winning rolls. If you're doing a lot of duo questing I think double feral would be a lot faster than any other combo. You can still do heals/tank for any dungeons if you want as well.
---
Why not just do antidote with webwood venom, and when you do moonwell run right over to iverron for the last quest and suicide there? Then you only need 2 suicides and 1 hearth, that's the way I've been doing it.
---
I think youtube may have taken it down, I have tried once every couple of years since BC to find the video again but I can never find it no matter how many pages I search in youtube.
---
Jokes on you, I'm already unemployed.
---
I originally thought this, but that will leave a very long time between patches for retail.
---
I think they will push 8.2 in June with classic to compete with the FF expansion.
---
Besides, 8.2 will not draw in the players that have quit retail, but FF might.
---
I don’t think there’s anyway they only have a few weeks between announcement and release date.
---
Blizzard said that the beta on the CDN is actually an internal Alpha test for their employees. It’s on the CDN to test out that delivery system (so employees can play at home basically).
---
Its impossible to strike a balance and I think this board should have its own identity as well, but l like the format of the neighboring board r/2007scape where its a mix of memes a plenty and healthy discussions of the game, aside from customer support queries, its a fun place overall and I hope Classic can provide the same feeling of amusement and comfiness in  board culture.
---
&gt; Or maybe I shouldn't give a shit. 
---
Game reddit and forums are always 90% pure shit these days. We just need a release date and get the game out, then you can NEVER come here again (maybe just at work) and just enjoy the game.
---
Have you ever compared a weekend trip to a while week off? They are totally different. Also, you say yourself, wow does not require vacation time, so you agree with me?
---
I think he meant 1 hour 20 plus the 32 mins for 1-5, which brings it to 1 hour 52 for 1-10. Here's a video of nelf druid 1-10 in 1 hour 50: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bqrgoubzTo
---
Honestly most discussions about classic already happened, news are scarce and there's instantly 100 videos and weekly podcasts anyway.
---
Nostalgia stories are cool, but at this point it starts getting repetitive aswell.
---
Most questions asked here nowadays can be solved by searching.
---
Memes and hype, that's all that's left.
---
Well Blizz have form in releasing content at the same time as its competitors.
---
Guess making a post for this is as useful as your comment then.
---
Hi, /u/tommybizz
---
Even shitty memes are better than discussing same thing a thousand times. And there have not been a new topic like for half a year.
---
I don't think they've got any plans to set a "special" date for it, I think the date is just gonna be when they truly feel it'll be done. My own guess it sometime between June and mid August. I think early summer is most likely.
---
REEE
---
I only have early leveling experience. 1-10, triangulating makes warlock the easiest class to level to imo. But then with voidwalker, I feel like I can get more DoT uptime. from 10-20, my strat was to approach a clustered area, send the voidwalker on one, dot it up 3x, send my voidwalker to target 2, wand target 1 one or two times, dot new target, voidwalker on new target, rinse repeat. And this would be functional for very high speed constant kills for at least 6-10 mobs. Then, just lifetap, let health funnel channel once, and back to the madness.
---
I'm sure you know how to kill lol, I'm just saying that voidwalker \*does\* make everything quite a lot easier. If I had the option to voidwalk from 1-10, I would choose that in a minute. Im sure for some tough mobs, you could try balancing your threat with your imp, SUPER closely, and ping-pong the mob, but thats ultra specific.
---
Sharding will reduce this hopefully to an enjoyable level.
---
Yeah, I hear Trolls get top threat per second allowing the DPS to go wild.
---
I don't really agree since I don't think it matters which one people do. Some people really enjoy games and find them just as relaxing as going to the beach.
---
I'm being send to do some audits in countries without much infrastructure.
---
- NO mobile coverage zones
---
- Extensive daily travel time
---
So I know that it is absolutely impossible for me to be there for the launch (unless the launch date is miraculasly in sync with my home stay).
---
BUt heh i lvoe my job witch is nive i guess, just being a bit salty about the overall situation :)
---
I believe activision will be thinking on their pockets, you can bet it will be a relevant date to make sure they cash in as much as possible.
---
"Make it more convenient for me plz, fuck the other two."
---
Ah nuts!
---
I agree 100%. Even taken with a grain of salt, Blizz has said that they really don't plan around other releases *too heavily*. They will probably just release it when it's ready, in a couple months. 
---
I don't necessarily agree about June, I feel like thats off the table, but July 16-August 6 is my guess. I try not to take too much weight to offhand statements, but I dont think "you'll be having a Classic Summer" is an offhand statement.
---
Honestly this depends on how serious you want to take it. If you want to go anywhere near hardcore, you have to start asap to get ahead of the crowds. If you are playing for fun somehow casually, that week of being behind wont really change anything, it will actually be better since there wont be as many players in the starting zone.
---
Minmaxing (esp. for lategame) is not "common" by any means.
---
Every day that goes past without a release date we have no release date. True fact
---
I used a Naga but I have to say that keyboard keys are just faster and better hotkeys. You can use:
---
12345
---
QERT
---
SFGH
---
XCV 
---
This are the easy ones and can also be used with shift and control as modifiers (depending on your macros)
---
You also can use:
---
S 
---
Shift + Spacebar
---
I don't like them much though
---
That should be enough hotkeys for everything.
---
I also like to bind b to my hearthstone

And by "higher" we mean "greater than zero", unless you're a troll.
---
Try to cast spells in batches. As a druid, heal up the tank then cast HoTs on him (rejuvenation, regrowth) so you don't have to cast anything for 10-20 seconds. You can use regrowth to heal the tank up to 100% AND keep him there due to it having both instant and over time healing.
---
When you have another healer with you, you can just take 10-20 second pauses, where the other healer spams spells and then you switch over. This is a solid tactic for long fights where you can rotate your heals. In reality most raid bosses and trash dies faster than you go out of mana, so it's not really an issue.
---
The most important tactic is avoiding casting shitty downranked spells when OOM, because they do nothing but stop your mana regen. When you go OOM, it is better just to stand around using bandages and pray that the tank has his CDs on and has healing potions. After 10-20 seconds you'll have enough mana to quickly save the day.
---
While I agree with most of your comment, I said in my original post that I don't ever plan on tanking raids. If I did get the time and wanted to raid, I would most likely spec holy. I do appreciate the detailed response though!
---
I stepped into the hinterlands on my first character and the first 3 mobs dropped BoE world drops.
---
1.Epic Gloves of Holy Might
---
2. A blue drop, can't remember what it was
---
3. ANOTHER Gloves of Holy Might
---
Hinterlands became my favourite zone from that point
---
Something thats always intrigued me more than speedrunning raids, is the concept of going skeleton crew. Trying to do every boss in Molten core with 20 (or less) people. Or ZG with 10.
---
Theres also self-inflicted hard modes. For example, Hakkar with every priestess alive. If i remember right, Elitist Jerks tried to kill Hakkar with 3 priestesses up, and barely managed it. So there is still a hard-mode thats never been done in Classic.
---
wtf... who has to book their vacation that far in advance! I just have to give as much notice as time i want off, so if i want a week, i have to ask a week in advance. Its not always 100% as i travel a bit for work and i cant take time off then. But if i wanted monday off, id have to ask by the end of today!
---
Never take launch day off. It almost never launches early in the day and once it does launch the servers are gonna shit themselves for several hours.
---
Yikes
---
Have you ever heard of OneNote?
---
I can confirm. I've farmed all the expensive mana oils, food, runes, mana pots for first time going into the raid, realizing all that is unnecessary because the boss dies faster than I go oom most of the time. Having less healers in raid does not really affect this much because then you haven even more slots for damage dealers who raise the raid damage even more.
---
Jokes on both of you, I'm already dead.
---
It's new expansions these days I believe. Previously it was a GM decision.
---
And the problem is not the creators posting these, but those readers who prioritise these over more interesting and/or useful content.
---
you ever tried wiping at 1% and have everyone lose every buff and consumable?
---
I don't think it's sustainable enough to be efficient for more than the lower level ranges. Generally as you level up the mobs will get more health faster than the imp firebolt will improve, making it have less and less of an impact. And then once you're dealing with packs of 2-3 mobs (i.e. Westfall/Barrens) you're going to have more issues just getting the triangulating down without getting your imp killed or mobs onto yourself.
---
It's not a brand new game, they've already delivered a playable experience for players, they're putting the finishing touches on before they let us in a beta (if required).
---
Found the female serbian player.
---
Love it!
---
This is also why having energy watch is useful for every class, not just rouges and druids. I can see when I will get my mana and can time a 3 second healing touch to be synced with it.
---
Yup, this is me!!! I am so looking forward to this. I am looking to buy a good gaming laptop, so I can play on the move....pretend to work late to the wife, while getting in a couple hours uninterupted play without kids aggro....
---
I'll play / level on a few hours during the day and plan on taking a few days holiday (or work from home), maybe a week after launch once the mad rush has "slightly" died down.....haha
---
True minmaxing, no. But a lot more people than you're implying will choose a race for combat benefits if they've been playing WoW since Vanilla and making new characters over time.
---
And for everyone who doesn't, there's no real reason to assume any bias in whatever race they enjoy. So that crowd would be evenly distributed. Add in the ones who do choose a race for combat and those choices will obviously become the "most common."
---
Any fleeting, random thought warrants its own post on this sub. Preferably stickied.
---
Where did you get into they're putting the finishing touches or there may be a beta - if required. Do you have insider info?
---
Have an upvote good sir
---
Big if true
---
Some real apex twins shit here, i hate it.
---
Huh? Does it like apply to base regen and then improve Spirit scaling?
---
Correct. 5 second rule is important for priests and druids in 5man though. If utilized then the healer does not need to force the party to a halt just to drink and regen mana, he can regen enough during combat.
---
You might need to reconsider because the experience gained in a zone is nothing like it is in retail or even TBC. You won't b e able to get from 20 to 30 in hillsbrad, and you most certainly won't get to 40 in arathi(and wetlands is a ally zone).
---
Have you ever plaied Wow before ?
---
If yes then just pick the Faction you used to play the least, it can be a refreshing experience to see new areas/quests/npcs
---
:)
---
&gt;most of the numbers I recall seeing for active server pops after that was highly in favor of Horde, especially during TBC and then continuing through most of WoTLK. I didn't play after that.
---
well thats because Horde got Blood elves with their good looks and op racial in tbc.
---
That has no value for Vanilla.
---
Doesn't really matter much. The posts of importance gets stickied/upvoted to the skies, so you're easily able to scan the sub for important news. Other than that, yes, it's just memes. But the current setup isn't disturbed by them.
---
I really want to play Shaman (enh), not sure about race yet. But i also liked doing vanilla dungeons, and think that playing a tank i might get more invites...
---
&gt;we get some % of mp5 while casting.
---
Do not confused mp5 with spirit. Mana per 5 second is a stat on items (and on buffs like blessing of wisdom) that works regardless of whether you are casting or not.
---
Easy for me. My first genuine main was an orc warrior. When classic hits first thing I’m doing is recreating that badass.
---
https://youtu.be/xvuoh7WGvtc
---
We have 74.3k members 2k of which are paying attention at any given time. We have all these people, and even if we wanted to make quality content we couldn't, cause all the content has already been made.
---
So yeah, if it weren't for the memes the place would just be dead.
---
Thats the same for me, but for the summer vacation, a little more planning and coordination is required. Someone needs to be at work at all times where I work.
---
That is literally what an internal alpha is for -- seeing what needs to be polished before pushing out a beta, IF a beta is required. Since this isn't a new game, and since they don't need to test a whole lot given the scope of the vanilla, they might not need to hold a beta period. 
---
They said Summer, they've recently been very publicly confident about summer, your feelings are unfounded.
---
I really like this sub and am so excited for Classic. I hope when we find out a release date things get better. I'm downloading WoW so I can scratch the itch on a private server...but i'd really like to get to chat more with folks on here in anticipation.
---
I mean I appreciate it. Everyone is excited and are trying to find ways to express it. Feel free to direct your memes this way my dudes. I'm stuck in the nashville airport for the next 45 min
---
Jokes on all of you, you just lost the game.
---
Ii had a lvl 60 warlock.
---
Did some MC and onyxia on it but mostly dungeons/pvp/random stuff.
---
Scaremonger!
---
You sure you're not disaccurate about that?
---
I played at launch. And I had 3 toons to 60, a human paladin, gnome warrior, and gnome mage.  I can’t wait to play through the original Azeroth again. This time I am leveling a gnome warlock first 😊😊
---
Idea: Do an actual poll.
---
You really think they’re going to release a game like this without large scale beta testing?
---
Hey man can you just comment like and subscribe me, cos this has taken me a lot of effort, thanks bro.
---
What happens after naxx?
---
Warriors are sometimes very tough to level, but if you know how to do it, you can actually be incredibly effective and have very little downtime. On my last warrior vanilla leveling experience, I don't think I ate any food at all almost between level 10-40. 
---
What I did, was I specced arms for imp rend, and went on a hamstring spree. Download an attackbar addon, which shows your weapon swing timers. Pull the mob (charge or ranged), use hamstring, then run away from the mob until your swing timer resets, run back into range, hit again, then run away. Repeat this over and over, and you only get hit 3-4 times each mob if timed correctly. 
---
It is a bit dependant on your ping, but it works really well. The most important thing is to have good weapons while leveling. Also level first aid and use the cloth that drops for bandages, and you'll do just fine. Would also recommend mining (for arcane crystals at 60) and engineering (if you plan to pvp), if not herbs is also good for making gold.
---
I only played wow for free back in the day until lvl 20. Dont know which expansion that was since i was way to young to remember.
---
Bro make that into a PDF and share it!
---
boooo
---
I actually forgot to add it. It's there now!
---
I had a level 60 shaman and mage, did mostly 10man stuff but dabbled in MC a couple times
---
OP, what do you think is left on their task list before release, given the recent news that they're on internal alpha?
---
Is there a poll involved here? 
---
But to answer the question, I joined the wagon in '05. Made a couple toons, didn't make it far til I got a warrior to 33 or so, and pretty much abandoned them in Desolace. I went warrior cause my older bros said that warrior would be the easy class. Meanwhile... they went mage and hunter &gt;.&gt;
---
So I decided to roll hunter, since not only did it look *easy*, it looked fun. I loved the idea of having a pet following me around. I only ever made it to around 55 or so when BC came out. Part of the reason was that it took me a good while to settle on a hunter. Another part of the reason I was 8 or 9 years old, and was constantly trying to get back to Aisrtrip or beneath Stormwind. I miss those days, but I'm glad to be going back as an adult with their own account and place.
---
main twink and alt 35+ lvl for profs or even 49 with herb/alch ? thats my plan
---
I didn't say they won't, and I hope they do have a beta period if only to give modders access to the API before launch so we can start with mods already available, but since this isn't a new game, I don't know how much there is going to be to test.
---
Took my vacation in June to make sure I have one and not just play wow :p
---

---
Based on thottbot comments flasks were cheaper than elixirs are now.
---
Did anyone else read the first paragraph and have to reread debut because your brain said de-butt?
---
To build on this, I believe OP is looking at the level ranges for each zone and assuming "20 - 30" means he can level from 20 to 30.  
---
To set it a bit more clear, the level range label simply means you can find, for example, level 20 to 30 quests and enemies in that zone. Mileage on the other hand may vary.
---
or insane competitive twinks vs twinks once we reach phase 2 and everyone is geared by that time
---
I started playing back in April 2005. Leveled a Prot Warrior to 60, took me ages. 
---
I didn't have any 60s alt but I had a few &gt;40 alts I never got very far on.
---
Same way EQ1 and EQ2 handle it on their TLP servers.  May be the same for their normal servers too... never played the standard live game before.
---
&gt;beta period if only to give modders access to the API
---
that’s not a beta, that’s just a demo. The point of a beta is to test the game to find bugs before release, something which is needed in every large scale game and it will be needed for classic too.
---
I always level up through Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Redridge, and Darkshire, no matter what race. Then I usually hit the top part of STV, then Southshore, then the lower part of STV. 
---
Can’t wait 👍🏻👍🏻
---
If I do it correctly, I should be 20 by the time I head over to silver pines. 
---
I'd do Durotar, and maybe then try the run to Thunderbluff getting the flight paths at Crossroads/Ratchet on the way, and doing quests in Mulgore.  
---
Also, Shadowfang Keep is one of my favourite low level instances, so would be looking to run this a good few times in my 20's.
---
haha the way i see it, 15 years ago we rarely knew what we were doing and we still were able to down bosses easily enough.
---
Damn we’re on pre-pre-BiS now.  What’s next? Level up BiS? That’s definitely a thing already.
---
Right?  
---
It's never been in my nature to subscribe to anything on Youtube. I keep everything as simple as possible.  
---
I don't need to subscribe to a channel, I'll just go to it when I feel like watching it.
---
ITS MA'AM
---
I did it behind his back? I know my English is not perfect but where did you see that I called him a moron? He called him it that way here on Reddit, 14 years after...  
---
I have hundreds of stories about Vanillla. And for some, it had nothing to do with being a newbie but about stupidity. But whatever... nobody cares.
---
According to the poll so many people played at 60 during vanilla, I wonder how many people just press yes for the sake of it. I really would have thought that it would be 50/50%. Some people interested in the hype and the others being actual veterans.
---
Yes but 13 year old me didn't know who Chen was
---
Back in my day we used to play WoW instead of doing our homework. Kids these days got it all backwards.
---
I'd go orc. I actually really love the undead starting zone/lore, but that "feel" only lasts 20 levels max. 
---
There will be more undead than anything, so it'll probably be more congested in their area. Plus, orc stun resist is awesome for a warlock because rogues are a hard counter.
---
Hmmm that is the other option.
---
I just recently asked blizzard when I created my account back in the day - it was May 2005 :)
---
Had multiple 60s (Mage, Warrior, Rogue, Priest)
---
So looking forward to Classic!
---
I believe the whole shebang+$15
---
Dwarf Priest, Orc Rogue, Undead Priest. 
---
The Orc Rogue was my main.
---
I was thinking its best to mine as I go ideally il be herb alch at 60 but to 60 I was thinking mine and skin to try an maximise gold?
---
Yes, was heavily addicted and raided/pvp'd on two char 60's.  I also had 4 other level 60's, but they were poorly geared and I only raised them cos I liked questing.  I played 3 of them into tBC and got them to 70, and then only 2 on to level 80 after Wrath. Once Cata hit, thats when I quit.
---
yeah westfall and Redridge were great. Not sure horde can level their though? Loved that on my 1st alliance char, but since only played horde.
---
I really envy you being able to level something else than your mains. I am a mage by heart. Always played mage and always played them on vanilla private servers. I really, really want to play a hunter now but I just think I will regret it later on since it's such a big investment. You really have to choose for 1 character in the first few months.
---
They will care when 90% of the playerbase either quit or turn to private-servers again.
---
Both are acceptable.
---
I dont even care at this point. Depending on the chosen main class if i find a spot thats not too populated, just put on some music and grind mobs like crazy. It cant be that much worse compared everyone following some levelup guide to the letter.
---
Human is the clear winner for PvE, just thank to the extra weapon skill.
---
Ahh true. I only play alliance, gnomes ftw 😊😊. Dwarves are cool too 😜
---
Yes I did up to aq40 on a dwarf hunter. I was 16 in 2005, started playing about April that year iirc.
---
I used to laugh at the 40 ghosts running back to MC or BWL from the burning steppes Graveyard, when we were learning a new boss fight.  
---
I dont have the time to play like I used to when I had no wife or kids, and my job was less demanding, so I'm planning on playing on a PVE server, where corpse runs will be limited to me being stupid and pulling more mobs than I can handle, rather than being ganked by a bored higher level player.
---
Screw totem control. Just watch those clutch heals.
---
Enemies in that encounter can't be hibernated to my knowledge.
---
My plan is to scatter around. Moving to a new zone when I feel done.
---
Yeah, on Reddit, which is a small fraction of the playerbase. Overall, people will just choose whatever they like.
---
Not if they're asking for feedback 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
---
Plus, you realise that all the quests from vanilla were still in the game until 2010, right? How many bugs do you think are left that weren't already fixed? 
---
I'll reiterate, I hope there's a beta, I want a smooth launch, but I don't think there's going to be much to iron out
---
That kinda depends. Might be better to just start off with herbs and alchemy, considering you'll encounter plenty of herbs while out and about leveling, and making pots + getting max skill before lvl 60 is awesome! There are also quite a few pots you could sell on the AH while leveling. Free action potions for instance, swiftness potions. 
---
The thing with skinning is that so many will have it, that there will be a lot of price competition going on at the AH I'd imagine. I may be wrong, though. It kind of depends on how big the population caps. One good thing about skinning though, is that you can skin devilsaurs in Un'Goro, and those leathers are worth quite a lot since they're needed for pre raid bis gloves and legs for warriors, hunters and rogues.
---
&gt; but since this isn't a new game, I don't know how much there is going to be to test.
---
Considering just how un-vanilla the demo client was, I'm guessing a lot.
---
There is a post made yesterday that blizzard released a beta to their employees and they will release more information soon
---
yeah, I agree with you. I liked grinding mobs for easy XP, coins and drops sometimes. I could stick on movies and grind away. if its too busy with players all doing the same, like you said, I'd find a nice spot and grind away rather than quest.   /played time doesnt bother me at all as long as I am having fun.
---
Gross. Just go druid. Be  rest-bro-ration!
---
More like because I’m incompetent and I can see myself popping the buff in the middle of a pull cause hey that button needs to be on cd lol.
---
It is a new game.
---
Play a troll and join our ranks brudda
---
Blizz is planning on sharding the starting areas so i doubt there will be many issues idk about you but im going to play the second i can and im going to use as much PTO that incan because fuckit im an adult and thats what i want to do.
---
Yeah, I admit that wPvP makes dying a lot more frustrating. It’s odd that I still voluntarily plan on playing PvP when I know what lies in store.
---
We should appreciate these times before launch and people start to complain about X problems.
---
I see the headlines: 
---
1.UNPLAYABLE! 
---
2. BLIZZARD AT LEAST GIVE US X
---
3. OCE SERVERS ARE ALWAYS DOWN
---
4. WHEN WILL YOU RELEASE X-content
---
So yeah, let’s just be happy together for now, be it memes or discussions :)
---
Gnome rogue and dwarf priest lvld to 60.  Fun times.  Thinking I'll start with a warrior this time.
---
Rogue that took 21 days to 60 - lost the account due to teleporthacking. Bought another account next day and never hacked again. Then a hunter with Rhok'delar - had so much fun.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b3c33i/tanking_school/eiyunfd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x
---
At some point in the past blizzard noticed there's a large number of players bouncing off the game after certain amount of time which likely correlated with increased dying. Then they've noticed that reducing the pain of death increases player retention and carried that thought to most punishments game had to dish out.
---
When a game is punishing, even superficially, it holds success in higher regard and players follow suit. It's a very tempting and low hanging fruit to make the experience more accessible, a.k.a. less dire in consequences of your choice. The downside is that said choices must also become less impactful (why stress over picking right talent when you can change it in a heartbeat?). 
---
A low hanging fruit that tempts many designers and could, controversially, be the reason wow is still alive today in the first place.
---
the type of people to hang out here has always seemed to reflect the older playerbase that has previously played during vanilla, as well as many who played private.  they were the ones who pushed for classic in the first place
---
Save boe blues while you farm bis, and between prof changes, pick up enchanting and get you some shards too
---
I had three lvl 60 characters. Human Rogue, Gnome Rogue, Undead Warrior.
---
started april 2006, got an ally warr to 60 and cleared some of mc before bc dropped
---
Drak can't be slept, but the two chromatic guards can.  They're highly resistant to every school of magic, but if you get a couple druids spamming it will eventually stick.  Having two locks chain fear works just as well, but then you run the risk of someone breaking the fear and getting dumpstered.  The hunter kite method is pretty much the standard though
---
Same here, haha. A laptop will let me ”watch” TV with my wife and level at the same time.
---
Innervate is on a six minute cooldown, not three.
---
There's no information about the internal testing progress so all of it is just your speculation. They might just started it or they it was a thing for a year.
---
I don't know, but if the list was completed or nearing completion, I see no reason to not share a release date. Unless there are business strategic reasons to doing so.
---
Hey guys, Kripparian here...
---
If you got to 55 as an 8-9 year old I’d say that’s really impressive. Not an easy game :)
---
Yes, started in April 2005 when the game reappeared in the stores after the initial drought. Got a horde Shadow priest to lvl 59 (but couldn't bring myself to grind that 1 more level in Silithus) and then rolled a NE hunter who I played throughout vanilla. In TBC I mained the aforementioned Shadow priest and later in the expansion a frost mage.
---
Yea im in the same boat, always played PVP but thinking of PVE for classic. Then it hits me, im going to get so bored at 60. Like what is the excitement and livelyhood of the world if i dont have to always check my back and be on my toes for opposing faction? Its the same philosophy as this thread, if it wasent for the constant fear of death the game would not feel as exciting and it would become more like a job. You sign up for raid, fly there, wait outside dungeon and then do said dungeon.  
---
When i played pserver we would gank up 3 whole raids in a seperate discord to just be able to enter BRM and take us to BWL, it was amazing and fun and did not take longer then it would to gather up our own guild. It just adds that extra excitement.
---
I remember dying at Stonetalon peak in Stonetalon mountains and it was a corpse run of epic proportions. Cant wait!

Yeah this was awesome, absolute chaos if the raid didn't have a locked in plan too.

no blue = classic memecraft
---
I second this. The trick is to refrain from dotting an undead until you use a grenade on him. Usually, you fear, he use WOTF, you can predict that he'll comme back to you then your nade is pretty easy to target. He will have 5 sec fear immunity, so you have to wait ~2.5 secondes after you use your nade, put a dot, wait 1,5 seconde GCD while running opposite way, cast fear which should land exactly after the end of WOTF immunity. Be careful for range interrput or stun and be ready to use your trinket / fake cast depending of the opposite class.  
---
If he use trinket (not all class can remove fear with trinket), you have the option to fear again (but the fear will last a really short duration due to 3 fear in a row), run, or death coil but i would suggest to keep this for a real emergency. Usually a good option would be to tempo until the DR of fear wears off and then fear him freely, as he won't have WOTF of trinket anymore.
---
I was in Eden Aurorae at the time Maquan made the movies. Serphentos and you was in &lt;Twenty four Seven&gt; right? Or was it &lt;Amaterasu&gt;? 
---
Even though I was only social guildmember back then, being in Eden Aurorae brought some sweet fame on dunemaul and misery battlegroup:&gt;
---
How do you communicate with a person like that, via Morse code?
---
Serphentos and myself were part of &lt;Revelations&gt; if memory serves, but it was an awful long time ago. Wasn't Twenty Four Seven the enormous noob guild?
---
Would It be fair to say that the low hanging fruit was what started the decline? For an example relating to this thread, Cata was really when the concept of a run back became a non issue. Maybe it started in Wrath, but it was full blown by the time Cata came around. 
---
The same low hanging fruit concept comes from things like LFD, LFR, easier dungeons, less dying in general. All these features could theoretically increase retention. But in reality, I think the long term retention suffers, as evidenced by the current subscription numbers.
---
So again, as you say, it’s adapting the original game with intentional design elements to a state that’s built on statistical retention, and not engagement, or risk/reward as it was made. I disagree on your last point though. I honestly think WoW could still be in a fantastic state if they resisted that soggy low hanging fruit, in regards to many mechanics. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the most gamechanging xpac was the first ever to see a drop in subs, and a massive one too.
---
Started a warr yesterday on p-server. Not my first, but this time i got a 2H green sword with +2 agi and high dmg and hoooly shit it was s new experience for me.
---
The lvl 10q sword isnt that could, i would get skinning asap and just grind so you at least can afford by lvl 12
---
Being Alliance and trying to kill those Nagas at BFD riiiight next to the Horde's outpost. Oh boy did that quest take many corpse runs to get through. Thank God I won't be Alliance this time around, good luck to those who will be though! See you in Ashenvale! ;)
---
I'm not following your logic. There are 20 working staff days between now and the *start* of summer, but all Blizzard ever said as "Summer 2019." So, you need to include the additional working days that are spread out among the 92 days of summer, which is approximately 65 more days.
---
So, Blizzard has 85 "working days" (M-F) to release Classic. That doesn't seem unrealistic at all.
---
Release date when?
---
I would like to clarify that I didn't just make this up. Druid shapeshifting between forms to refill energy bar, gnomeregan mace to buff attack speed. Druid feral is mediocre at best, but if you min/max (being dedicated) you will outdps warriors on a lot of fights. It's just so cheesy to play and very stressful tbh.
---
Yes I was also r14, cleared Naxx, scarab lord and had sex with Mike Morhaime.
---
Same! Can’t wait... to never go to stonetalon mountains.
---
Head over to r/mountandblade and then you will see a real memefest
---
not 2.5 sry
---
Do bear in mind that this is a reactivation of an old game, not the creation of a new one. 1.12 is an already tried and tested build of the game with a long and well-documented history of bug fixes and balances.
---
The Alpha and (if employed) Beta stages are going to be about only ensuring Classic runs without major tantrums on the Legion(?) version of the engine. 
---
Those stages will not need to be anywhere near as extensive as the Alpha and Beta stages of a brand new product.
---
Yes. Classic would have been successful had it released in 2019 as a new game or in 2004. This was their opportunity to bring in all the new people. When we were in our teenage years and that feeling we got the 1st time we logged into the game, every child would have that even in 2019. Games have not become bigger nowadays... They have gone more for instanced maps with teleportation menu between them not a world.

Funny how they made all of that stuff heirloom gear
---
It’s definetly a harder way to play, but at least it won’t be as bad as Private servers. I think people who played fresh high pop Private servers in STV have faced a horrific existence I hope we never see in Classic.
---
My plan is to log in, Press w,a,s and d, Slap some boars to death and see where it takes me.

You only recently noticed this?
---
Played back then, but only got to 60 a bit after the TBC pre-patch hit I think.

I've never been to a wow launch so I'll definitely go for it this time.

I mean, I'll take light-hearted high-quality memes over the smoldering dumpster fire that is the Anthem subreddit.  Most discussions that were worth their salt have been said and rehashed 100x over 15 years.  The current state of this sub, is pretty much everyone and their mother are waiting for a release date.  Would you rather have 50 "BLIZZARD RELEASE DATE PLZ!!!!" posts or funny memes that deliver that message in a humorous way?
---
There's discussions to be had all over this sub, but until Classic launches, or at the very least gets a release date, you're going to have to get used to a large influx of memes.
---
Am I genuinely the only one that's in no rush?  Don't get me wrong, I'm excited and all, but classic wow isn't the only thing I've got going on in my life to keep me happy.  
---
I'd rather they take their time and get it right, even it it means a winter release.
---
Oh fuck OFF.
---
This happens to every single sub when there is down time.
---
People run out of things to discuss, they start  creating memes, then the meme police come in and petition to make it impossible to discuss anything or have fun on the sub.
---
Seriously, just scroll past them. Be an adult, and dont click on them. Or better yet, if memes in an online forum for a 15 year old game bother you so much, get a fucking hobby.
---

---
1 month to go for the holy book of world of warcraft to be written by prophet Joana :P
---
&gt; I've seen guilds where every class had to be 100% raid healing oriented, even for low tier raids and for classes where that truly only offers 10% increase in performance.
---
That would be mine, for instance.
---
Even if it's MC everyone's expected to bring 100% because we will be world buffed, we will be doing multiple pulls at once and I do not want to lose WBs on trash because someone is shadow, elemental or moonkin hybrid-specced, PvP specced or what have you. It's about pushing it to the edge, and that requires everyone to give it their all.
---
That's basically it. Other than that make sure you complete quests for your level, because you get less reputation for lowlvl quests. 
---
Here you can find a list of every single quest in the game that gives reputation to human. https://classicdb.ch/?faction=72#quests
---
Look up every quest that gives human rep and do it at a level appropriate for that quest. Theres some rep that grand rep with your entire faction like the WPL cauldrons so make sure you do those.
---
There you have it folks
---
memes are as good as sex.
---
That sounds exactly like how I play.
---
It's more important to use this rule in 5 mans than in raids.
---
In 5 mans you are going to need to regen when you can even during fights. You may even, for example, as a priest top the tank off with a greater heal and then toss a bubble and a renew on them then stop casting entierly. The bubble and renew will keep their HP up for a while while you regenerate and queue up the next greater heal. As a paladin you may drop a big heal on the tank to top them off and then HoJ a heavy hitter to stop their damage for a few seconds while you start to regen. 
---
Good tanks in 5 mans will recognize when you are trying to regen and do what they can to minimize the damage they take.
---
It's important to find time to regen. Don't be obsessed with topping everyone off especially when your gear is dogshit because you just wont have the ability to keep casting constantly. They have food, bandages, and defensive options to their class if they need it. 
---
In MC honestly it's less of an issue because you are just going to be chugging mana pots and dark runes like they are going out of style. Your goal going into MC is to have a decent set of pre bis gear from dungeons with enough +healing so that you can effectively do some down-ranking on your heals. 
---
With a combination of downranking and using mana pots + dark runes you wont ever have to stop casting.
---
I only made it to level 55 when BC dropped.  I was a noob and leveled as a holy pally the entire way.  Never stepped foot in a raid until Kara.
---
Had  lvl 60 night elf rogue.  Killed 2nd boss of naxx before BC
---
Also had a 60 gnome mage alt.  
---
Loved those days.
---
Whoosh
---
A half ogre isn’t a big surprise in the universe. A Kung fu panda is a little different
---
Thx, i guess i have the time to prepare, will look up the quests :)
---
I will be levelling with a friend (human) would it be okay to level in group for the xp or would it diminish the rep gained?
---
Cuz he would maybe be able to help me finish up some quests i was lower lvl for aswell.
---
&gt; **This doesn't seem possible.** 
---
You heard it, folks. Classic is cancelled.
---
That ZG mount... the dream goal, never saw it drop once back then :(
---
Lmao people downvoting me as if there aren't 90 posts a day about that and can I play Ret in raids.
---
It’s what makes warlock insane 1-10. After that? Nah
---
He's that good at kiting.
---
No one from Oceania would willingly play on EU
---
I started playing in April or May of 2005.  I got my human warlock to 60 shortly before TBC dropped so didn't get to see any of the end game things in Vanilla.
---
I think when there’s a reason for text post they will increase but we are on a dry week with no news and no game to play and talk about.
---
You become flagged when entering a contested (yellow) zone, or an enemy (red) zone. Prime example of a contested zone is STV. 
---
As for getting ganked all the time,  cant really say for sure, but more often than not you have atleast one other zone in your level range that you can go to, if ganking becomes a problem at your current zone.
---
Except the needed damage was completely made up. After 1 minute or earlier people start dying (assumption that everyone lives for 6 mins is wrong) and the chances of wipe starts rising, and the longer the fight goes on the higher the chance. For reasonably clean kill without chance of wipe you would want him dead long before any submerge. The chance of wipe increase is conveniently incalculable of course.
---
Another thing that is wrong is that you're not being carried as long as you get the kill. Well no, there is also smoothness and speed of the raid. If everyone in the raid just played however they like with no regard to performance as the moonkin, that would change the smoothness and speed of the raid thus revealing that the moonkin was indeed being carried.
---
If you're willing to wait a bit longer for rep battleground mark turn ins and AQ war effort turn ins yield city rep.
---
I truly aspire to be this person. Only thing is my main is going to be a human, but I'll make up for it by being a mage and giving out copious amounts of water.
---
I've been a member of this community since the very first day after the announcement of Classic, and this topic has popped up (and gotten a good amount of traction) at least two times in the past. 
---
One of them was a big uproar against memes which caused many active members of the community to stop posting all together, and also was the cause of Rule Changes against low effort content. Needless to say the whole thing was stupid and nothing changed, since the people that are vouching against memes never take the time to think why is it they see SO MANY memes here. The only thing that came out of this is that now we have slightly higher quality memes than 4-5 months ago, which is nice.
---
Before complaining about any of this, you really need to work your mind around the reasons why memes are so popular and why they gain so much traction versus other content. This board is full of hype about a 15 year old game that's not been out yet....! 
---
Between the reveal of Classic WoW and now, virtually everything has been discussed to death already, the content posted here since Nov 2017 is INSANE. The discussions have been endless. But we quickly got to a point that conversations started being recycled and this is still going on till today. 
---
There are so much times you are willing to engage in the SAME conversation again, so much times you are willing to discuss "Changes vs No Changes", "Should i play X vs Y vs Z", "Raid viability of X Class", "Modern player mentality vs old player mentality", "Meme spec or not?", "Look what i found in my attic / thrift shop", "How to do X", "Guide about X", "Orc on Undead", "Rush to 60 or take time", "Leveling routes" etc etc etc.... 
---
Virtually everything that could be said has already be said and discussed to death, multiple times. All of this was happening over a period where the news about the actual game were next to non existent (2 blue posts in a year LOL). There is no way you can have a front page full of interesting fresh and new conversations you can have, especially with the game being unreleased. 
---
If you're a long time member of this community it's obvious that there are meme heavy periods, mainly when we have nothing new to talk about, it's understandable. Memes are a way to keep us engaged and feed our hype, and the majority of us agree, that's why memes are often up-voted hard as fuck. When THERE IS something to talk about tho, it's always being always discussed to death and memes slow down during that period. It's a natural circle. 
---
This sub-reddit has evolved over time (yes, evolved not DEvolved) and will continue to do so, when there is an inherent lack of new things to discuss memes will naturally take over for a period of time until we have actually something NEW. Things WILL change A LOT when the game is actually released, but do not expect memes to disappear. 
---
*Memes are not prohibiting other conversations, discussions in any way, shape or form.*
---
You can quest in groups it doesn't change rep at all.
---
Not only that, the majority of those memes are terrible and don't even make sense. It's just some desperate attempt at attwhorism
---
Fairly sure it is not unheard of in this industry to work overtime during the day or weekends nearing a release.
---
When you enter a contested zone you will be flagged. In general the starter zone and the next are friendly (e.g. Durotar and The Barrens) and then follow contested ones. 
---
Due to the way the PvP phases are implemented you can expect to be ganked and camped without mercy in phase 2 especially when you are still around level 40. 
---
In phase 1 (no dishonorable kills) you can expect that a lot of your questgivers will be dead. 
---
You decide if that is someting for you.
---
I think you underestimate the potential playerbase of this game. Yes it will be no where near the 10 million plus we saw back then but it will be no joke.
---
just "get sick". explosive diarrhea and all that
---
As horde? There is nothing for us in wetlands except death.
---
For real, ready for my searches to feel official and not need to add special modifiers.
---
Beware of the huge selection bias in this poll. Players who had a lvl 60 back in vanilla are much more likely to answer your poll.
---
You guys can argue all you want about niche crap but I know I’m right. I will concede some points: 
---
Race selection for priest matters less on Horde side. If you’re alliance though and not playing a dwarf priest you’re doing it wrong.
---
Dwarf vs NE for Hunter is also not a big deal. The consensus is that Dwarf is better for PvP and NE is better for PVE. Troll is by far the best Horde Hunter, if you’re not a troll you’re doing it wrong.
---
For warriors, threat and DPS are king. Humans and Orcs have the best balance of both. Don’t give me the crap about Thunderfury being BiS so Orc tanks are not the best. I’ve played on many private servers and most Warriors never get one. Even the ones that do spend most of their playtime without one (they tend to quit a few months after they get it). Furthermore, Warriors don’t know if they’ll be given main/2nd tank spot, which means solely basing your decision on which race is the best pure tank is a foolish one. Human and Orc have the best balance of important DPS and Tanking traits and are the superior choice overall. Everything else is niche/circumstantial.
---
Doing the stockade gives you SW rep right?
---
If you are horde on my server I'll buy all your thick leather.
---
It's probably because people who didn't like play vanilla like me, can't be arsed to vote, meanwhile anyone who did wants to show off.
---
what else is there to discuss? if you've got something you want to talk about start a thread
---
Classicdb.ch is the new thottbot.
---
I used it yesterday to find Kul Tiras Marines.
---
Uhh, [classic.wowhead.com](http://classic.wowhead.com) is a thing
---
not nessesarly a whole marketing campaign with billboards and ad space in time square. But sponser youtubers and twitch streamers for a week of content. Lots of them would be glad as they wanted to play it anw.
---
Shroud is a vnailla player and will play classic.
---
Linus tech tips is the same.
---
lots of small and Bic content creators can help push this game and get people talking about it
---
Source?!
---
savage.
---
getting flagged at low levels depends on your zone. You can be attackable at level 1 if you're in the wrong zone. A good rule to follow is the first 2 zones are ungankable, like Elwynn and Westfall, or Durotar and Barrens. But once you step food in Stonetalon you are able to be attacked by the other faction.
---
If you're getting camped by someone you usually did something to deserve it or just found some random jerk, its highly uncommon for people to devote a huge amount of time to killing one person. Most non aggression kills happen because of territory. If I'm a rogue and i see a mage questing near me I really don't wanna spend a ton of consumes and 2 hours 1v1ing this mage, plus maybe my weapons are out of date or something, so I /wave. If the mage knows he can kill me hell attack right away and I know to avoid him, he'll kill me again if I get in his way, most poeple with wave back or ignore you can keep questing. 
---
The times you get killed for "no reason" are usually you are around someone who could easily kill you and you give them a reason to. Say I'm a hunter killing murlocs and an opposite faction warrior is killing the same murlocs and I notice need 1 more murloc to complete the quest and there is only one left the warrior tags it. Well, I'm not gunna sit here and wait for a respawn when I can easily kill this warrior take the murloc and move on. This is me being smart not a "random jerk". And when you approach a new area thats full of opposite faction never just assume they wont attack you, be prepared to fight back or leave the area.
---
Player behaviour is largely predictable, people very rarely act outside of their own interest, understand that and you can level as a PvE spec on a PvP server and with minimal deaths, of course sometimes you get some asshole just being a dick but if you just run back and do everything you can to avoid him it usually doesn't escalate.
---
If there's one think I love, it's filling out surveys.
---
Im in Classic for the long run, so waiting for the different phases aint a problem, i just want to make sure while levelling im not going to miss any bit of rep i can get :)
---
I got an early https://classicdb.ch/?item=5423 Boahn's Fang on my orc warrior I felt like a god!
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the explanation! I wasn't trying to be douchey; it just seemed like a waste to ask one after the other. But this makes sense!
---
Quality content. This is what I come here for. I also am offering free cow hugs.
---
I was one of the first gnomes on my server back in Vanilla to get exalted with SW for a horse mount. It was a lot of work grinding and turning in cloth, but so worth it. I plan on doing it again in Classic 😊😊
---
I started playing on patch 1.5. Played a Warlock after ditching a level 20 hunter and a level 40 shaman.
---
I got to 60 with said Warlock 2 months after I started playing.
---
Did some raid pugs, got to rank 10 and did the whole t.05 questline. The 45m Baron run was awesome.
---
Go Orc
---
resto is #1 raid spec and enh shaman is going to likely be max 1 per raid w/ a nightfall. pvp enh is fun but falls off without gear. resto pvp is meh as far as relative effectiveness, but any pvp healer is a good healer.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
I"ll be unenployed when it releases, so I'm going hardcore from day 1
---
I did some rough calculating assuming the drop chances of the diffrent leather on diffrent level mobs and assuming you will always kill beasts at the same level. 
---
It is without rested or questing and 100% beast grinding.
---
Here are my results:
---
10	0,43514
---
20	2,27434
---
30	10,38534
---
40	48,27434
---
50	157,62234
---
60	393,98834
---
So when Thick/Rugged Leather kick in you will get good money.
---
But also the 48 gold at level 40 looks good when you need to buy a mount.
---
But as mentioned this is 100% beasts which is very uncommon :D
---
You're right - it doesn't matter. And I mean no offense - I am truly sorry if I offended you. I was simply put off by your original post about a "moron" who messaged you asking why he lost HP's, but I can now see that it was not your intent to mock him for doing so.  
---
Moron by definition as I know it: "An individual exhibiting the maturity of a 12 year old"
---
I was never around when streamers became a thing. it definitely wasn't a thing back in TBC and vanilla
---
Man, fuck going second!
---
Antidote is linked with the egg quest in the back, which lets you suicide back gathering the whole moonwell quest in the first place
---
Cross posting, I just edited my previous answer :p
---
you definitely will get more invites as a tank. i played enh and regularly made my own groups and made them melee heavy. very few of them failed because the dps from WF was like having a 6 man group. added bonus was the tank barely lost threat. you will probably be the lowest dps though.
---
You're almost as hardcore for Classic as I am for DnD :D
---
It's always worth noting that WotLK is when the growth stopped. When as many people began leaving as were arriving. I feel like that expansion deserves more scrutiny than it gets.
---
# Nesingwary Camp... oh god...
---
Started around 1.06. had a 60 shaman. Cleared The 20mans and MC. Dabbled in Bel and AQ40. Had a few slots back then as well but nothing serious.
---
My personal recommendation is to level with Enchanting to get the wands if you're going for speed. Levelling herb later is relatively easy as hell.
---
If you want the best chance to get other faction mounts as early as possible, then you’ll want to min/max reputation gains by minimizing experience from non-quest mobs while maximizing reputation from all faction quests as you’re leveling. If that’s your goal, then you should consider a quest completionist strategy. You can read more about that here:
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
Played since before Vanilla even released. Still have my emails from the beta and was playing on Day 1. Still remember my family wondering where I was a couple days after launch on Thanksgiving. I ended up getting a Warrior, Mage, and Rogue to 60.
---
These posts always seem so self righteous,  essentially asking , "hey ya'll, only post the stuff im interested in, no memes today please"
---
When the reality is, people who actually HAVE interesting discussions to post, still are, its not like they are losing posting "slots" to memes.
---
And Maybe just maybe your magic wand solution ruins it for all who prefer to get all my classicwow info/memes in one place.
---
Stop trying to curate reddit to your wishes and allow it to be whatever it becomes
---
i never played real vanilla but i have been playing on unofficial servers since 2011. Still i feel like the game has enough to offer to keep me happy for the next 10 years
---
This is good info, thanks for this.
---
FYI it's fine to observe a problem without having a solution for it.  
---
It's an extremely infantile mindset to think that one cannot present a problem without having a solution readily available.  
---
As for the OPs post; the old man in me agreed to an extent, but I also agree with you in that this is a 15 year old game that doesn't have any new content and everything has been discussed.
---
The most logical solution would be to shut down the sub, but I know that is probably not a popular opinion...
---
Kargoz hiding in the comments!
---
After recently quitting Fortnite and then joining this sub.....
---
You. Have. No. Idea.
---
Isn’t troll the bests threat generator for a warrior?
---
How does your guild let that happen lol
---
Our raid leaders would holler... "Get naked and die to the imps!" so that we would all run back and not have to fight mobs going to the next boss.  Back then, they didn't realize random drops and the importance of actually teaching the raid how to handle each of the trash mobs,  but then, too, we didn't have a lot of add-ons, all we had was CT Raid and even then, our screens were FULL of chat, icons, raid members...
---
But it was a very, very magical time.  I loved those naked ghost runs back to MC.
---
The ONLY runs I didn't like were the ones back into AQ40 after an attempt, and finding out that the trash (some groups were harder than the boss) had respawned.  
---
Class acts are those in a five-man who ALL run back, zoning in and moving in a group together through the dungeon.
---
You dont take vacation days for a game. What the reason, you can just wait until the weekend and enjoy it then.
---
Use your vacation days when you planned to do it, dont alter it for a game
---
You haven't lived until you've gone ass-to-ass with Mike Morhaime.
---
&gt; Another thing that is wrong is the claim you're not being carried as long as you get the kill.
---
I did not claim that.
---
All I claimed that you are not being carried as long as you deal more than the minimum damage that is needed. Because at that point, you do enough damage to not be useless. Now when the moonkin does double the needed damage, which is the context of what we are speaking here, it even more so does not matter how much less damage they do compared to a fury warrior, because they do enough damage to do the encounter.
---
&gt; Go ahead and prove that you're not being carried, have a raid where e.g. every caster is moonkin and try to get a smooth ragnaros kill.
---
I hope you can follow this, because I'm not sure how more easily this can be described with random numbers.
---
Boss A needs 100 dps minimum per dps to be killed by 30 DPS members in 2 minutes. If you use 30 moonkins with 200 dps each, the boss is going to be killed in 1 minute because they all deal double the damage needed. If you replace 29 moonkins with 29 fury warriors who deal 600 dps instead, you will be somewhere around 20 seconds.
---
It is clear that fury warriors kill faster. But both the moonkins and the fury+moonkins were able to kill the boss without problems. The sole moonkin in the fury group was not carried. If anything, he dealt less damage, but enough to kill the boss based on the requirements. Absolutely viable, but far from optimal and a worse choice.
---
Karazan -- porting up to the middle of the instance after a wipe is what started this.
---
Ah! I remember that guild now. 24/7 I think performed fairly well in AQ40 and was atleast in the top 5 of the alliance guilds on dunemaul. I'm not sure if they finished c'thun or even twins though but up until that they were OK. I think the master toxic human priest Abx was GM at the point they disbanded/quit.
---
Yikes.
---
Yeah, these are all the classics. I like popping over to Ashenvale for a bit too, it's always so low-population and secluded over there. Same with Desolace a little later.
---
Being Horde and wanting to do the furbog quests for the drops and wonderful xp!  Yeah, an undead doesn't look out of place in Ashenvale!  :)
---
I started on NA- Hakkar and was in &lt;Red Rum Runners&gt; and &lt;The Roots&gt; before transferring to Draenor and running with &lt;One Dragon A Day&gt;
---
I don’t think I’ll have time to raid and am planning to PVP at 60. Knowing that I’ll be casual, what class do you think is best?
---
u got a link for that asmonbold lvling ? would love to see it!
---
The questions is, what's your definition of easy? With micromanagement, manamanagement and downscaling plus the occasional 'run out of x aoe effect' you essentially have more to do than in the current WoW where boss mechanics are more complicated but there is no mana management, you have dozens of viable skills, every class can to everything.
---
Overall I would say that Classic raids are harder in fact.
---
I played in 2005 but I was like 7 years old and was too retarded to get past SV at level 30 so I just levelled random characters for the whole of vanilla.
---
Gotta be that gnome priest for +int racial, obvi.
---
The first time I saw a horde character was in Westfall! It was a Tauren just sitting down in the middle of nowhere minding his own business.
---
Haha nice one good luck with the raids! Sounds like you have found a good solution ;) Fortunately for me i met my wife in game during WOTLK so we will be power levelling together on our desktops that are set up in the bedroom haha!
---
the kamehameha ani is unbeatable
---
Low-effort memes are supposedly banned under rule 7.   All the ones here look low effort to me tho...
---
My plan is to go wherever I feel like or applicable, and just go with the flow all in all.
---
r14 rogue "Nurf"
---
I see a reason, this is not a traditional expansion and the marketing will not be treated as such
---
definitely not easier as a lock, maybe even, but people want that food/water
---
I too would like to know about this, as a possible healer myself. (Possible, because for the life of me I can't settle on a class)
---
I must be thinking of a different guild then. I definitely recall the biggest guild on Alliance (probably the server) was some huge catch-all guild that you could just ask to join and they'd invite you, but who never had any success in pretty much anything. 
---
If any Twenty Four Seven veterans stumble across this, I apologise for tarnishing your good name!
---
it can be purged by priests and shamans though.  
---
and you are speaking of grp pvp. there are more factors in play.
---
I’m rolling warlock! Stay away, REEEEEEEE!
---
Someone like OP would for the exact situation they're describing in this post.
---
That's not the problem. It is not 20 seconds vs 60 seconds. There is literally no fight like that, in every single fight as the fight drags on the chance of wipe increases as the fight drags on. Especially with ragnaros as I tried to explain.
---
Theres an addon called quickheal that people use on private servers that does exactly what you describe. The functionally for that addon to exist is definitely Blizzlike but it's unsure if they will allow that or recreate it for classic. The dev's havn't given us any information about it as of right now. I really hope it isn't recreated tho, it really ruins the game and makes terrible healers think they're amazing.
---
IIRC, Blizzard has stated that the Classic API won't be supporting automation addons.
---
Wowhead is an ad loaded shithole.
---
Classicdb is goat
---
You might be right. But that will make it very easy to kick the habit.

Blizzard releases the game when it is done. Not earlier nore later when it is done. As with every game that ever released.
---
Giving a rogue Thunderfury before anyone else is disrespect, giving a Ret Paladin TF is sheer stupidity. They can't utilize the weapon, it's a one hander
---
You see no reason is exactly the problem with your theory.  You have zero inside knowledge on thier progress or thier marking plan.
---
I was a real scum bag in vanilla because I was young, now is my chance to make amends this time around and actually help people.
---
Orcs with an axe are comparable (and there are many good tanking axes). Furthermore, while being comparable at threat they are far superior at DPS and PvP....meaning Orc Warriors  win out over trolls overall.
---
I aim to be that friendly person.
---
They will sponsor many Blizzard/Youtube/Twitch content creators with beta keys, 100%.

Not sure! Depending on when the sharding comes off it could even be adisadvantage to start later if when sharing is first removed suddenly starting zones will be busy with those that lagged behind!
---
It means I was awarded top .5% of all pvpers not just the realm. But the entire battle group. Gladiator is a big achievement.
---
Yeah that k3 respec is my boy
---
Oh i really hope it works out for you then! Plus i don't want to wait till September &gt;.&lt;
---
Blacksmithing can never drop their specialization in Vanilla. Even getting rid of the profession and reacquiring doesn't work. (BSing didn't get the ability to do so until 2.1.3 in TBC, though by then every prof spec could be dropped simply by talking to your spec's trainer and paying 100 gold).
---
It does work for LWing and Engineering though.
---
Thank you, i will look into this.
---
Yeah, I hated that add-on.  I remember this one guy would use it with a self clicking program, the same one he'd use to afk farm in av.
---
This is a change I'd be happy to see.
---
Joana might be specifically looking for Rogue specific changes and tips to integrate! Consider reaching out if you feel like you have something to offer:)
---
Yeah I'm not really planning to get ahead so i think it might be best for me to wait till the rush has calmed down to get the most outof my levelling time!
---
The good ole auto click jump every 10 seconds in AV trick.
---
Yes there is. They're shit and slow down DPS. Some naxx and aq fights are DPS races.
---
I think it might just be a simple case of - not everyone gave his okay to their current "expected" release date. 
---
It is not only Blizzard that sets the release date I would think there is some other factors that Play into it too like production and Distribution of the collector Editions and such :3
---
I´m just a pleb tho so don´t give this comment any credit whatsoever. I just like being ganked the shit out of in STV which is why I´m here
---
Yep. Dudes just late to the party.
---
Hasn't logged on in 10 years :(
---
That hit me right in the feels
---
I love Gnomes but their mounts just bother me with the noise they make, prefer the horse mounts instead :)
---
I want to get my names saved, then I will be pleased.
---
Yeah for sure! We've all waited so long for this what's wrong with making the most out of it and taking some holiday to enjoy our hobby! People take golfing holidays lol i see this as no different!
---
In other words, you used to come to this sub for entertainment and amusement and now that youre no longer getting any satisfaction suddenly its the subs fault?
---
Why dont you make some OC for us then, or write a post about something that hasnt been discussed ever?
---
i'm not sure i agree with this because look at runescape.  massively successful with a very wide age range, despite the fact that it's complicated, VERY grindy, has huge punishments for dying and has very little quality of life stuff (eg teleporting requires magic levels and costs you money and you need to carry the materials etc)
---
i doubt that corpse run times had that big of an impact, you didn't even die THAT often
---
\[at least thats how i remember it from like 15 years ago\]
---
With hibernate/roots -&gt; starfire -combo you can solo most elites as druid. It takes really long time, but you can do it.
---
I see you can not comprehend the fact that you are not being carried when you do more damage than is needed.
---
This is no easier vs harder equation. It is being able to do content. If you do enough damage for the encounter, you are not being carried. End of story.
---
Have a good day.
---
Loot council is for gear that profits the whole raid.
---
Mounts should always be /rand (ofc I'm not talking about the Scarab Lord thing here).
---
And if there's master loot in a Baron guild run, it's the sign that something's not right !
---
Can't wait for your video of killing KT as ret within 1 week of release.
---
Agreed. And hopefully it's towards the end of summer so we can enjoy the nice weather and the kids are back in school.
---
i highly doubt there will even be a beta man. there is literally no more time to fit a beta to take in feedback and release the game before the end of summer.
---
34 yo,
---
Only a mother and a already married brother.
---
no GF/wife
---
I'll be able to play Classic at work (semi-afk mode).
---
I want to raid as prot war or holy priest no-life mode, not sure if i should burn 2 years of my life on this game, but i'm willing to do it so hard
---
Yeah towards the end of vanilla it was so incredibly out of hand.
---
The fact that in the first 10 trash mobs in MC you run into a need for a taunt is a bummer for pally tanking. 
---
But you're a perfect tank for Deadmines, Gnomer, and ST.
---
Well - I have only ever played on PVP Servers - I can´t think of a reason not to Play PVP :D
---
I usually don´t gank People while I Level because I get annoyed by that myself and I feel like there is a bunch of People that feel the same and rather just run by you then risk being killed.
---
That being said I never played through the release of a new Server. I usually give it a couple of weeks until I start playing so most People are already ahead of me and there is not as much competition for the Mobs. 
---
I guess it depends on how much you want to Play in the beginning because if the enemies are contested - then you will be killed and will corpse run a lot
---
tyvm and sorry for the late reply!
---
The irony of this is that the original bird is fitter
---
ty, sorry for late reply!

---
Sucks when you hate Reddit humour but subreddits are still the best place for relevant news and discussion.
---
I tried it.   But all the vanilla items I looked up had versatility?  Classicdb is much better.
---
Still within 5 minutes another "what should I play post" will appear, even though there is 100 others identical questions.
---
Shit Yeah! That is the only thing really, I'm planning to make 10 characters with the names i want since i don't know what alts i will play lol
---
But can you change his mind?
---
This is a common format on american college entrance exams (although I think they were removed relatively recently?)

---
&gt; It's an extremely infantile mindset to think that one cannot present a problem without having a solution readily available. 
---
Why are you telling me this? I didn't say he couldn't present a problem with no solution. I alluded to it being shortsighted. I continued a discussion, something that OP really wants. The only reasonable solution is to continue doing what we're doing. Otherwise we remove memes from the subreddit, we see the same topics we've talked to death already, and then we get posts (just like we have before) titled "This board has now devolved into reposts" and then we have to create /r/classicwowreposts and now we have 3 dead subreddits.
---
Saying "too many memes, not enough discussion" when all the same discussion threads are recycled on a weekly basis leaves the question, "What discussion are you talking about then?" because it's here. It's still going on.
---
Level 20 in 18-24 hours played is the standard I aim for.

---
I'm really curious to see what starting launch population is. One part of me says 20,000, mostly the private server community, and we find out how many people really do not want to pay money for this entertainment.
---
Another part of me says half a million and blizzard is caught completely unprepared LOL.
---
He had 2 hours as the respawn timer.  They respawn between 13-17 mins.  So yes, wayyyy faster....
---
No, only qs do
---
Thats assuming you just skin your own kills. At launch a LOT of the people will be killing beasts and dont have skinning. Since its launch, they will usually loot everything from the corpses, so you can get quite a bit more skinning done of mobs you dont even kill (ofc it slightly lowers your levelup speed, but i suspect you are waiting for spawns anyways).
---
Other thing to remember is bagspace, you cannot carry or sell everything or you are mostly running to town to sell shit. Its nice if you are mainly grinding your xp, because it doesnt really matter where you are.

I'm not trying to make any sort of arguement, I'm just trying to express how I feel about the difference in style between the models which is pretty difficult since it's a very hand-wavey thing to describe. I do promise that I'm not trying to be a generic internet douche about it though. 
---
I'm strictly talking about WoW here, not the Warcraft series. The new models have much larger eyes, a bit less stern of idle facial expressions, and an overall look that seems a bit like it was made out of clay. In comparison, all the old models had small eyes, very serious looking faces and the lower quality left a gokd amount more to the imagination by only focusing on the parts you'd notice immediately. 
---
I think a big part of the disconnect here is that many people like the art style for different reasons. Even if it seemed a bit cartoony originally, I always really liked how they managed to balance subtle light hearted (including cute, colorful, light-hearted things such as Gnomes) themes with fairly serious looking and acting characters. I imagine some people always saw it as cartoony enough that making it more cartoony didn't matter to them, but to me it threw their original balance off a ton.
---
Also as an aside, I would say that WC2's art style is a bit of an outlier in the Warcraft series. WC1 felt very gritty to me, even if it was a bit colorful at times, and WC3 was sort of it's own beast due to it being the first one to use 3D models. The concept art across WC2 and all of the others felt very consistent though.
---
&gt;Holy god buying all the mats to level Engineering will be insane. INSANE
---
It's really not that bad, maybe like 100g or so. My guild reimbursed 50g when AQ40 was released for people that switched.
---
Can you give me a link?
---
Because all the item stats are showing up just fine for me.
---
And yes, classic.db works great too
---
Account started in nov 04.

---
Decent for leveling dungeons. Worthless endgame
---
Yes I did! This is the character that I played from early vanilla till very recently:
---
[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/sunstrider/yar](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/sunstrider/yar)
---
Oh the memories... The /played is way to high as well haha. Feral in vanilla, and boomkin pretty much since early TBC. 
---
Had several other max level druids throughout the expansions and a shadowpriest. Only 1 level 120 though. I'm ready to go back and relive my memories!
---
Ordinarily I wouldn't but classic wow launch is a one off experience I've been wanting for years. And since I met my partner in WoW we will be levelling together, we've been bored of retail for so long so it's really exciting to enjoying playing together again.
---
But I think even without that idon't see the problem with talking a holiday to enjoy your hobby :) people go on sports holidays for example and its considered socially acceptable but for some reason it's not with gaming. I'm still deciding if to lie to people about why I'm taking time off because ican't be bothered to try and explain xD

Yeah meme culture has pretty much ruined the internet.. On top of facebook grampas that are unable to distinguish fact from fiction and I'm ready to just delete the whole thing and go live in the woods while the world falls apart into ww3
---
Most people have covered how the pvp flagging works, but in regards to opposing faction ganking behavior: you will be ganked on PvP servers by people way higher level than you. Maybe not all the time, but it will happen and you'll need to come to terms with it before you get invested into your character for 30+ lvls before deciding that dealing with it is not your thing.  
---
If you do run into body camping gankers, my advice is to just alt tab, get up, do something else for 10-15 minutes.  they'll get bored and move on.
---
I didn't even make it to 60 on the last private server I played because WPL and EPL were such a packed warzone. Ended up being just as well since that server got nuked a couple months later. (Nostalrius)
---
Nice one! Hope it all goes smoothly :D will be aspecial experience anyway!
---
Thanks for the answer :)
---
Do LW and Engi drop their specializations the same way, or different? Does it have something to do with the engineering memberships with MEGA (gnome) or GEEK (goblin)?
---
I mean if you put a coin in me you bet your ass i
---
I'm going to spit out some refreshing cold drinks.
---
And let's be honest here, it's the gaming industry, they're working weekends too more likely.
---
My memory is a bit bad, but my plan is to start in the gnome starting zone, then go to Auberdine. Come back later and go through redridge and nearby zones... When I hit 40 I will do a lot of dungeons, because back in the day I loved Scarlet monastery, uldaman, zulfarrak and the sunken temple :)
---
*No, I'm a fireballin' M.A.G.E*

Love to download these patches and read Whats New in the interface above. Also my old WoW was divided in 5 cd’s😂

I guess I was wrong!   My bad.

Maybe I'm old I'm only 28 but yeah memes don't make me laugh not even a nose breathe. The new one with the grand theft auto guy is especially pointless to look at.

Signup as tank /healer /dps and min/max in each group.  (Had to run as dps on a few runs with my alt when I was to slow to signup as healer.  ).  Especially 20mans.

We are not at TBC yet.
---
She's just around the corner.
---
current WoW design: we need to replace gear / give level ups with lots of flashing lights and sounds to keep the skinner box / casino vibe going. players need their dopamine hits.

old WoW design: if you put the effort into something, you get the satisfaction of being rewarded long term.

---
As someone who mained a raiding warlock I think I can help you here. Tailoring for bloodvine (+hit) on a warlock is huge and can only be worn with 300 tailoring, though those sets won't be released until ZG is. Enchanting to get the wands for levelling faster is good, but I don't see much point to having that as a main prof. I'd switch those 2 anyway. Engi is great and mats can be bought somewhat cheaply (I disagree with the other response that said it would be "insane", look for my response to him on that). Even if they're a tad expensive you're picking 2 of the best solo farming classes so you shouldn't have much of a problem with $$$ regardless.
---
Was in Invictus on Illidan.
---
Wait, there was a horde outpost next to BFD? That explains so much.
---
&gt; When do you become "flagged", 
---
Outside the starter zones, typically the first zones you get to when you hit \~lvl 10+, you're safe in the cities unless flagged. PvP flag lasts 5 mins until turned off in safe zones unless you decide to leave it on. You will also get flagged if you attack the opposing faction. It was a common trick to duel people because people would often accidentally attack after the duel ends.
---
&gt; is it only once you get to a certain level or is it zone? 
---
Level doesn't matter. But I believe you'd typically make it to about 10 before you'd leave the safe zone. You will get auto flagged whenever outside safe zones.
---
&gt; is it possible to get higher without being flagged? 
---
Nope. All zones beyond 10 are contested. You can and will get camped.
---
&gt;  is it a gank fest with rogues camping you? 
---
iiiit...can be. Just like real life, it's a matter of chance with anyone you pass by. You will get camped at some point before 60. You'll get left alone eventually, log out for a few mins and log back in, camping usually isn't personal, they're either bored or trying to get you to log onto your main. Have youtube on another monitor and watch that until they get bored of camping. Alterantively see if someone will help you, typically someone will, which is another reason lowbies get camped.
---
&gt; Do you have to group up more because of ganking or does it not really matter? 
---
It's up to you, but like I said, if you ask for help you'll probably get it. That's actually one of the most common reasons massive wars in the middle of nowhere start and it's amazing when it happens.
---
&gt;  I'm a little concerned I'd spend a lot of time dying and not leveling 
---
It won't be bad enough where you'll get camped more than you'll be questing. But full warned, it's a PvP server, PvP happens on them, if you're not okay with that pls don't be one of the people to complain on the forums about it. If you really don't wanna risk being camped regularly, I'm sure you'll find competent people to raid with on PvE servers. If you have very limited time, then yes it's possible you'll have most of or an entire session wasted by being camped.
---
Undead. Troll racists suck for PvP tbh.
---
I agree wholeheartedly, but the best way to fix this issue is by trying to contribute to things that haven't been discussed to death. I just made a thread thanks to your post, just to get some basic discussion going on more system based things.
---
Dwarf was 1 of my 1st characters too. Vanilla was hard. I remember spending a long time up at the mills in terisfal glade
---
I feel personally attacked rn.
---
Telsrassil, Darkshore, pilgrimage to westfall, redridge, duskwood, wetlands, stv, arathi... I'll improvise from there
---
relatable
---
Just you wait until the subs grow even larger. As a subreddit gets more followers, the quality inevitably goes down. r/nba was one of, if not the best place for basketball discussion up until about 2013 or so. The sub numbers went up like 40% every year.
---
In my quest to find a hybrid class to PvP and PvE with, I'm looking at Shaman. 30/0/21 looks fun. Damage in PvP and the ability to heal in PvE sounds nice. My question is; how needed is mana tide totem in raids?  Will I be able to heal in MC/Ony/ZG without it? Probably won't be looking to go any further than those raids. Maybe AQ20 at a push.
---
It was after that experience that I begged my dad for my own account and computer so I could play along side them. I had to leave that dwarf paladin sadly. I started a nelf druid and continued to love the game
---
Is this actually true? I never thought the subs started falling off after Cata. Although, I did quit after about 3 months of WotLK. I had fun, did what raids there were, and making raid progress still felt great. I dunno, I think my biggest reason was just burn out. 
---
I later preffered to play a lot of the MMO-lite type games or looter shooters. The early days of Destiny Raiding also felt great and that Hard Mode VOG was insane. But now everything feels so watered down(including current wow) that I want nothing more than just classic. And I mean true classic with 40 man raids, although a lot talk about how great BC was, I don't think I'm all that interested in it.
---
I have one chance in my life to experience the re-launch of the game I love. I'm not going to miss the launch hype. Even if the servers are a lagfest (which I doubt) it'll be enjoyable to sit on voip with friends and try to spam login, just like back in the days.
---
**FUN fact**: I was browsing old WoW forums around 2002-03 when Blizzard was just recently revealing the game, and one of the people in the forums was asking how the subscription works, and if he has to mail money to Blizzard every month to keep playing. Lmao.
---
Also, I'm talking about WayBackMachine. I wasn't actually browsing it during 2003.
---
&gt; It's like being at a decent party with around 20 people, everybody getting along. You nip to the bathroom, and when you come back out 100 people have arrived. 100 loud teenagers trying to impress eachother, being ironic and edgy. You try to find your friends but you can't see them through the crowd and the noise. The party isn't over, it's just changed.
---
This is literally my actual real fear for Classic Servers as well.
---
Yup, and yet.... ive had 3 gms who did this
---
Sometimes it's hard to hide. I was kicked from my raid for being feral/resto hybrid spec, which was obvious from my huge mana pool (Heart of the Wild). In retrospect it was a good thing because they spent the next few weeks wiping on Razorgore while I was having a blast in PvP.
---
Hey i'm a danish guy to looking for an Ally guild to raid and have fun with. I'm semi serious and would love to be a part of a your guild.
---
For horde mage pvp, easily undead for Will of the Forsaken racial (immune to fear, charm and sleep for 30 seconds). If going to strictly pve, Troll for Beserking for dos increase... but let’s be real, undead animations look cooler
---
Not gonna lie, my warriors on private servers are allways Undead. Idk. There something I really like about it.
---
What I would do actually is to book 1-2 days off for the launch and then whatever you have left after a week or so. The launch is a very unique and awesomely exciting event so you might regret missing that. That is if you actually can split your off days like that. It might be even possible that Blizzard releases it on saturday ^^
---
&gt;the kids are back in school
---
That sounds beautiful. Cries in 1 1/2 year old that doesn’t go to school.
---
I'm working on a OneNote  section for WoW. You can search and sync it across devices so you could have a phone or tablet next to you while gaming at all times. 
---
Currently I'm in the stage of "watching WoW videos and  procrastinating on putting anything in the doc". It'll be great.
---
yeah.
---
Your membership card has nothing to do with having the specialization, it just gives you access to the specialty trainer. 
---
You also have get random schematics when renewing it (including a few exclusives ones that can't be acquired any other way).
---
I know there's tons of Classic-itemized resources, but that really wasn't the point of my post.
---
I was trying to say we won't have to see this depressing red text anywhere, when it will most likely be replaced with "This item is only available on Classic realms. That database can be viewed **here**" or something to that effect.
---
Even leveling as sub, I would still go into combat to start, as daggers the 30% crit and 1.5 sec on gauge is good for pvp, and if swords, then the reduced ss cost and gauge also, then start working your way to prep
---
This brings back so many memories.
---
When I bought the game I remember installing it on my computer thinking that I didn’t need to download any updates. 
---
I remember it finishing installing and I was so excited to play, then Realised it needed to download updates. I had to wait until I went back to my dads house because he had internet. And I thought I could play it at my mums house with no internet lol.....
---
Hard to explain without ruining the video so just watch and you'll understand the reason for both links, enjoy :)

I want to play priest on horse but having trouble deciding what race to pick. Everything iv read says troll is the best horse caster but undead looks so cool. 
---
Do Undead make for good end game healers?
---
60 human warrior. I somehow stumbled into a major raiding guild through a series of guild mergers, but I was pretty casual. Eventually rerolled a hunter in like 2006 with a bunch of HS friends and ended up getting 70,  then rerolled a belf hunter and got that to 70. I was still casual AF, but I got slightly more serious on a DK during wotlk for a summer. I played a little during college, mostly just pvp, but had pretty much quit by cat. I got convinced by some old friends to return for cat, but I think I made it a month or so before ending it for good. 
---
And that, my friends, is the tale of wow and I... so far. Many of my old HS friends and a few others I’ve met along the way are all excited to return to classic. Being ancient now, I think I might give raiding a shot, because what the fuck else am I going to do with my weekend nights anyway.
---
Been impressed with this site.
---
&gt; Memes &gt; 'what happens after naxx'.
---
As someone who dislikes memes in general, the above is a true statement.
---
I think by the end of classic I had a level 60 warrior (H), rogue (A), rogue (H), druid (H), and shaman (H). I'd say a handful of characters made it to 30-45, but every character that got past that point made it to 60. From an XP thing someone posted, I guess that was halfway for a lot of them!
---
I think that's the key here. If a normal human were as upfront and bold as he is, it would not be the same. But because his customs and behaviors are outside the norm it is humorous.
---
I don’t think I’ll have the time to raid and will classify as a casual player. Will I still be viable as a mage in PVP to some degree or can I expect to get destroyed the majority of the time?
---
&gt;And apparently the pserver community hates druids, so gl overcoming their prejudice come Classic release. =/
---
Pserver doesn't hate druids, just druids with unrealistic expectations and  and goals. Resto, I can't get enough of especially in a warlock heavy (5+) comp. One feral is fine. One boomkin is alright in a caster heavy comp. Just don't tell me you want a debuff slot or to take bis gear from other classes. That's where the issues come from.
---
I did have a level 60 during vanilla, but I voted no, to balance out everybody that felt like lying. &gt;:)
---
yup, blizzard shorting out gy runs, and considering it just being an inconveniece shows their complete arrogance and not understanding of the design milestones of the very game they manage. Which original wow builders definetely had. 
---
nothing new here as with many other design principles. lik lfd.
---
and they thought they are helping ppl and making the game better... omegalul
---
do you really think they couldn't get more graveyards in vanilla or move them around? and they purpose didnt, right? maybe there is a reason for that? 
---
they knew where onyxia raid gonna be from a very long time back, and they purposely set the gy across the whole zone. wonder why?
---
The long gy runs were obviously done on purpose, not just some inconveniece they missed while designing the game. To make the gameplay more exciting, and that you have something to lose and live and fight for. pve, wpvp, questing or whatever you do. the sense of how terrible is dieing is always there.
---
and the change, probably has to do with j.a.brack (and as that the best ppl from the old team went to design titan, which became overwatch). this dude came late to wow and just dont get it. you can tell it from miles away. he still doesnt.
---
Long gy runs is one of the core design features, i would even say pillars of the vanilla wow design philosophy. its not just one of the small thing.. its one the most important things, that define the player experience and feeling across the whole aspects of the game.
---
If, lets say they would add long gy runs to retail wow, even leaving everything else as it is. it would instantly change your feeling of the game. Though ppl probably don't die much in many activities in wow, still even the imagining of it the possibility of the gy run you would have to do would affect how you percieve everything in the game. even simply fighting mobs or doing quests. 
---
nvm, how much more exciting and tense dungeons/wpvp/raids would become. ppl would willing to communicate more, be more careful, value friends and good players and so on. how more exciting simple 1v1 in wpvp become, therefore value of your gear, and desire to get a better gear, value of your friends to help you, forming pvp guilds, value and motivation of knowing your class and how not to die, how do you approach the enviroment etc. etc. 
---
basically it  affects everything and changes the whole game. i could go on and on with all the various aspects of the game it affects drastically and basically forms the experience of the game.
---
thats why i said its one of the major pillars of the wow gamedesign.
---
Think about it this way, if you’re not trying to rush to 60, you may as well farm the cloth as needed while leveling because when you hit that 56-58 point you generally run out of good quests to do. By doing that extra beneficial farming you may only hit that point at 59ish and then you’re farming all useful endgame mats versus having to go back and farm linen off level 5-15 mobs AFTER you farm to 60 and also snagging low level potentially kill quest mobs from new players which I always feel bad about.
---
Also, I don’t think I’ll have the time to raid and will classify as a casual player. Will I still be viable as a mage in PVP to some degree or can I expect to get destroyed the majority of the time?
---
I've never read a more tragic comment.
---
It's just like thottbot. I'll be using it heavily this summer.
---
Do you just want to be stealthy or do you want to use a specific weapon like daggers? You can level as hemo post level 30. I wouldn't recommend if but you can for fun.
---
Thats my point yes.
---
There is no cloth turn-ins till the second or third phase though, right?
---
I'm in no rush for release, I'm in a rush to book my vacation days.
---
imagine being the guy that used this lmao
---
Interesting, thanks
---
Nice! I believe this is the time zone here in the philippines. Thanks!
---
Lmao was thinking same
---
Why would they do that?
---
The main wowhead site is for retail, just because classic comes out, doesnt make any of item available again. So that message would still be correct.
---
That's why they have another site specifically for classic...
---
Definitely waiting. I might take the day of off, see if I can get on and mess around a bit, but the week of no lifing (as much as I can as a dad now) will wait for a month or so, when things are more stable and it is less crazy in the zones. Theoretically.
---
Well the last thing we need is launch to be crowded with a bunch of 10-15 year old toxic kiddies that have no intentions on playing the game for what it truly is. The good thing about classic though, they should all lose interest after experiencing how long it takes to level.
---
Oh, okay, I thought it was an exploit with editing the stairs to look like chickens or smth like it so you can clip through it
---
Medium &gt; high
---
&gt;Why are you telling me this?
---
&gt; His solution is to the problem of 'too many memes, not enough discussion' but offers no example of a discussion we should be having that hasn't already been had. 
---
Really? you're wondering why I'm telling you that?  You literally said "he offers no example of a discussion we should be having".  That's textbook example of "criticizing someone for lack of a solution".
---
I mean this isn't even our problem.  The main problem is the lack of moderator involvement when it comes to meme reposts.  As I said, I agree with the OP that the sub has devolved into memes.  I'm not sure what discussions are "appropriate" or not, but I'd rather have Thread #268 about "what race is best for &lt;x&gt; class" than another stupid drake meme.
---
I had a rogue and a warlock. Good times!
---
I try to post one original thought about classes or gameplay every 2 days. Can check my history.
---
Within a few hours, I get the message from a mod that my post has been removed, because the nazi mods only want f\*cking memes on the front page.
---
This is the exact same thing I said yesterday when someone else was complaining about the same thing. Yeah, there's a ton of memes here, but what else is there to talk about? We've had all the major discussions, theory-crafted ourselves to death, and we have no new information to discuss as a community.
---
No ress-sickness :D
---
I see this is a thread where you’ve written your misconceptions about PvP. Title checks out.
---
I'm really not sure I'm the best person to answer that question.  
---
There's a TON of opinion on this, but I think the biggest limiting factor in your case, is the gear you get. Which means you need a character that requires a strong PvP capability without relying heavily on gear.  
---
I'm desperately trying not to steer you wrong here, so maybe ask this question a few more times on other threads, but I PERSONALLY think that mages are the best class for what you're trying to do, given that they are typically considered (and I agree) to be the best regardless of their gear.  
---
That being said, they require a significant amount of skill. And as other players get better gear, you may begin to have trouble again as other toons simply outgear you, making 1v1's increasingly difficult. So you'll really have to stick with it in the beginning, and accept that you will be steamrolled a LOT very often, very quickly, and you'll feel like you have no chance in many cases early on. If you're patient, you can eventually get the hang of it, and do quite well, provided you aren't going up against T2/T3 PvE players. But if you want something that requires a little less training/experience, you may want to consider a healer class.  
---
So if you want to learn your class primarily in BG's, a good place to start is with a Holy Paladin. Now, I KNOW these classes/specs are nowhere NEAR as enticing as pretty much any DPS class. And these guys require a lot less player skill initially to enjoy success. However, there are a TON of things you can do as you progress your skills to improve your survivability, and keep players around you alive as they kill things. Also, you get honor by keeping players alive as they kill other players, so honor farming is easier as a healer than as DPS. So for the casual player, this can be a great way to get those first few ranks, and blue gear. (Not to mention it's easier to get into LBRS/UBRS, BRD and eventually Onyxia/MC as a healer, if you manage to find time to experience those raids, which I highly recommend!)  
---
I know some folks would say "priest/shaman" but to be honest, I believe Shamans have a bit steeper learning curve than Paladins, and priests need gear to scale with content. Whereas Paladins are always relevant, even in all greens, tossing in buffs, bubbles, and judgements in order to manage the combat going on around them. IF you choose this route, I would say, you're a combat manager. You stun the guy doing the most to hurt your team, you cast a (light) judgement on the guy your rogue is killing (so your rogue heals himself), and you cleanse Fear or other magic spell on him so he can live a little longer to destroy your opponents. Once you are closer in gear to other players, you can risk tossing up a FoL every now and then, but focus on cleanses/judgements/stun first, especially if you don't have the gear. Then cast heals until you are CC'd, silenced or interrupted, then wait for the opportune moment when a nearby friendly is about to die, pop your bubble and heal him back to full while everyone around can do nothing but stare in annoyance and disbelief as you and one other player take on 5 horde and smash their faces into the rocks!  
---
...I hope this helps, and please, if you have questions, never hesitate to PM me or add additional comments (because there are a LOT of other, far more experienced players who can help you far better than I can!)

Think ill be am enchanter in classic..

im gonna take the day off for launch so i can get my character names. Then ill take the week after off. At least thats my current plan.
---
Ditto
---
It took me close to half a year to get to 60. i was in a series of colossally poor guilds and played mostly independently. i'd join dungeon runs thanks to local chat in the cities, and be a horrible huntard. i pity the groups that took me. incredibly patient people. 
---
i eventually cobbled together some semi-decent crafted gear and dungeon set 0 pieces, combined with the bow from a Blightcaller world raid i somehow lucked into.
---
i spent most of late Vanilla jumping into PUGs of molten core and, occasionally, zul gurub or AQ20. 
---
took a few month break, then resubbed in time for The Burning Crusade launch. i eventually rerolled horde and got into an epic launch day guild on a very old server, and have been a member of them ever since...although my playtime over the last 6-8 years has dropped down to 3 month bursts every expansion.

Thanks! That's a relief to know! I haven't been playing pservers (okay, I tried a little), but most of the comments I've read here seemed to strike me as distinctly anti-druid (which made me a little sad, even though I don't play them).
---
I second this. As a system admin (soon to be promoted to senior systems admin / IT manager 😁) I have no certs but I'm also 34 and built my first computer when I was ten. I can talk to someone for five minutes and tell if they know their stuff. Even so, a young buck with a cert or two does show me that they have a vested interest in their career. Good luck on the exam!
---
Pvp and raiding gear are  viable. I think it's more so that paladins are already pretty tanky, and because they're healers rhey get gear pretty easily, so they probably just don't feel it necessary to pvp 12 hours a day for four months lol
---
Pre-raid bis elemental shamans can hold up 450-500 dps with consumables for around 3mins. The biggest problem is lack of gear and, obviously, mana. I dabbled in elemental in vanilla and could easily hold that in ZG and some MC fights. Having said that, it's never going to be optimal and your always going to be near the bottom. And it only gets worse compared to the real dps classes after that, until you get some gear from AQ40. 
---
Enhancement is a joke.
---
Boomkin and feral I can't speak for but I can only imagine feral being more viable on alliance due to the lack of windfury and gaining BoK. 
---
There's always going to be dps from the more viable classes to fill up raids, I don't really see much of a realistic chance that many off-spec players will see regular raid action. There's always going to be exceptions but I wouldn't expect to find regular raid spots if your planning on playing, for example, elemental or enhancement shaman. UNLESS they plan on implementing the 2.0 talent tree at some point.
---
Waste of time.  Most mobs can be defeated without your pet even being out, so you are looking for DPS from the pet, or something that saves non-damage CGDs.
---
What the hell else are we supposed to do, there is nothing else to talk.about there isn't already 15 threads about you can search for.
---
So naturally the only things that get up voted are nostalgia posts about some.facet of the game, low effort memes.or the same "no changes but let's propose a change" thread that gets down voted into oblivion as everyone here needs to apparently tell op personally no or else they might happen.
---
So enjoy your melee until more.blue posts crop up because there isn't anything else to expect or talk about.
---
yup.....I found being the sole rezzer on my druid in a group caused the group to play a hell a lot of smoother.
---
Only for those lazy bastards to forget how to play the instant someone with a re-usable rez entered the party.
---
Drove me absolutely nuts.
---
Same here back in the days. Only that he stopped playing when I only paid back 3k out of 5k and I still want to pay him back to this day :(
---
All these polls on this subreddit are basically useless for getting an accurate picture of Classic's playerbase but it doesn't stop people from creating them and then coming to all kinds of conclusions from them. :P
---
Blizzard- "it will be done when its done"
---
Later, on top of the Zeppelin tower: You get Fort...you get Fort...
---
No it isn't. The more agi you scale with the more valuable it becomes.
---
...and not a lot of people will know this, especially if they're new to Classic or WoW in general.
---
I don't ever recall saying that Wowhead should put all the classic items on its retail section.
---
I'm saying, for the second time, that we won't have to see the red text saying something doesn't exist.
---
Its a commentary on memes affecting the community of forums in the same way that LFR and mounts have ruined the community on retail wow.
---
exactly- their interest will vaporize when they realize itll take a month or two to reach cap at normal playing times
---
You don’t have to be awful and clueless, he has a book of requirements and stuff he has to do literally stapled together. That will feel like a chore and won’t be fun. That’s my point, u don’t need a binder to not be clueless about the game.
---
&gt;and can put out substantially better threat than a prot war. 
---
this is straight up false.
---
the rest is misleading.
---
I would recommend getting some entry level experience, get experienced with both windows and Linux, setup some vm hosts and practice breaking and fixing things. Anyone can be a help desk jockey, but finding someone who is truly interested in understanding the WHY as much as the HOW is the number one thing I look for when hiring. It's one of those skills that you have to practice on your own time if you ever wish to make it in the more advanced positions.
---
tbh you can only have a "serious discussion" about a 15 year old game without knowing anything else about its release for so long
---
This!
---
The guild leader's girlfriend was the main culprit. She would always boast about being tops heals because the guild leader gave her first pick on everything so she had the Mana to just sit there and auto heal non stop. After the guild split and reformed without them it was a lot less toxic and I don't remember the add-on being a problem. Can't remember if Blizzard had started banning people who used it or what.
---
&gt; His solution is to
---
*His solution*, as in a solution he *has offered*. His solution was 
---
&gt; If I could wave a magic wand there would be a specific ClassicWow and a ClassicWowMemes board.
---
&gt; You literally said "he offers no example of a discussion we should be having". That's textbook example of "criticizing someone for lack of a solution".
---
He offered a solution. I said it was bad. Which makes this
---
not appropriate to the situation.
---
So his solution to there being too many memes is to move them all to another sub. I say that's bad. So let's move on to his next issue: 
---
&gt; I've been lurking here for months reading decent posts actually talking about the game, speculation, discussing what should be in it and what shouldn't, sharing memories. Now I see "Starterpack" and "Drake" memes. Does anybody laugh at these? 
---
So he's pretending that the sub is just memes now and completely ignoring the thousands of reposts we get every week asking to same questions over and over. Since we already have all this discussion he must be referring to something we *don't* have, but since he provides no examples, suddenly it's hard to figure out what discussions he actually does think we're missing, a rich concept coming from him, given that this meaningless repost is the only thing he has ever offered to the subreddit.
---
Its weird how there are these little snippets which are both 
---
a.) really memorable because they only existed during certain periods (so we don't keep seeing them and their memory is diluted)
---
b.) really inconsequential and forgotten by most because they were just a practical part of a process that has long been improved upon.
---
It'd be like stumbling on a VCR rewinder. You'll never need it, or use it, or even want it, but thats what makes it so memorable. It never became popular again so the only time you remember seeing one was back when VCRs were the primary format for movies.
---
Things that are great and important persist even after they've been replaced, like a super nintendo or a newspaper. You don't only connect those things to "their time", as they still get used long after their prime.
---
I had league of legends installed on my PC for like 4 years and never updated it. In the process of it updating, it went through 3 or so installers. I'm sure each of those was around for the height of someones LoL play and they remember that specific one, but will never see it again.
---
Does Carbaul or Blood Faith from Gorgonnash ring a bell? I was a Human Warlock.
---
The polls are a nice break from the Facebook memes this place has been flooded with for months. At least they can sometimes be mildly interesting, that's more than I can say for the latest Drake or starter pack jpeg about Stranglethorn, rogues, ret or some other infinitely hilarious &amp; relatable topic
---
All I am saying is that Activision have ruined/killed wow once and they can do it again.
---
No he said he was early and now everyone else arrived.
---
It's cause he seems so genuinely interested in her, in a non creepy way.
---
Like when &gt;!Brienne gets knighted.!&lt; He's just so wholesomely happy for her instead of jealous or turned on or something.
---
Joined vanilla retail midnight at launch in Europe. 60 female undead prot warrior. Cleared everything + r12 in pvp. Quit less than 24 hours before tbc launched. Can still feel sorrow over the fact that I missed out on that event :(
---
I agree. However what I disagree with is how the needed damage is determined, and you don't determine it correctly.
---
Its not even that hard to tank. The slower you go, the easier it is. The tank always sets the pace.
---
Lots of top parsing raid healers use these. Lots of healers use these on pservers tbh. We had one priest who topped meters by auto-following another healer and having his mouse autofire a single button that ran a complex healing script like this. He topped overall meters basically every raid. Not a good MT healer but basically unbeatable on raid heals. It bummed out the other healers.
---
I remember initially patches were distributed through a p2p like system, using some ports that were blocked on my school network, a fallback direct donwload existed but was soooo slow!
---
OP is trying to say that "meme have the same impact on forum discussion as LFR has/had on the WoW community."
---
So I guess this means memes destroy and stifle discussion in the same way LFR hindered the community feeling of a server?
---
The irony being that OP couldn't just discuss this but instead decided a meme was the purpose.
---
So idk. This post is 7 layers of hell kind of awful.
---
A good warrior is going to have a stack of healing potions on them at all times. If raiding, all the consumes that come along with that. 
---
;-) already got a dedicated protection spec warrior.
---
First was &lt;The Forsaken Order&gt;, just a bunch of casual people leveling up. Once I hit 60 me and a buddy went searching for a raiding guild.
---
Next came &lt;The Shattered Star&gt;. This is where we slowly ground MC and BWL progression until crapping out in BWL.
---
Then I moved on to &lt;Blood Faith&gt; and pshed BWL progression until I finally quit WoW shortly around TBC.
---
This was all on Gorgonnash-US.
---
Carbaul
---
I don't really care what my dps is, i just really like the class and skill sets (especially the totems!). But doing dungeons is my favorite thing as well. Haha, i probably will play both at one point.

Good art to look at while you download.

---
&gt;I'm saying, for the second time, that we won't have to see the red text saying something doesn't exist.
---
But those items do not exist on retail, so why should they remove that message if it's still correct?
---
They could maybe do a better job of advertizing the fact that they have a separate site for classic though
---
summer is currently 57 days away
---
&gt; I am now expecting a delay to classic wow 
---
They made a promise, a CM already reaffirmed it. Unless that has magically changed over the period of like a month, I wouldn't expect a delay until they say otherwise.
---
&gt; I cannot see how it can be delivered in these timescales if they are still in staff only Alpha 
---
I would take this as a sign we're probably not getting a beta. This isn't a normal game release as such that means they're probably not working within a traditional timeline so it's gonna be a short alpha which will probably stay internal even for the "beta" phase. What the alpha says is they're indeed getting pretty close to being done and polishing things up. Bornakk mentioned very specifically they're testing login systems, big +.
---
&gt; I am only judging this on my experience of working in several IT companies. 
---
Cool, lemme know when you have experience as a game developer. Even that doesn't mean much because nobody here knows what's going on internally, different companies do things different.
---
&gt; It's becoming quite disappointing. /sad 
---
You're getting disappointed over nothing, can be disappointed if they decide to push the release back which they haven't and I doubt they will. My own tinfoil hate theory here is there hasn't been more than 6 days without a post from a CM, if it goes beyond that I'm betting a release date is coming soon. It makes sense we'd get one either next month or the month after at the latest.
---
Thats so sick. But definitely looks like an alt cos of the engineering stuff and sll the consumables  Anyone know what weapons he's using?
---
I really love how playing the game feels like being  part of a world and only a small amount of fantasy is needed to make scenes way more epic in your head.
---
totem twisting.
---
That's the point I'm trying to get at.  I think the red text is there because they don't actually exist on a Blizzard-run server.  As soon as Classic servers come online, I imagine all of these stubs will be updated to direct someone to the actual item.
---
Lmao at the murlocs ripping your level 18 ass apart otw to deadmines
---
Upvote for thinking outside the box.
---
That was 5 days ago.
---
Now I just reserve names with an alt, like before Demon Hunters were added I just made a Blood Elf with the name I wanted. Doing the same now until I get Zandalari unlocked.
---
I too saw this on /r/wow earlier
---
Im with ya man, have definitely felt a negative shift in the content on this sub.
---
WAY too mana intensive in vanilla. Not viable
---
Times change... The way people communicate or convey emotion such as humor changes as well over time... The internet is no exception... Look at the game, Wow has changed so much over the years, which is why we're excitedly awaiting a classic version of it to be released... If you want a classic page where memes aren't allowed (or A CLASSIC classic wow page) by all means feel free to create one as there is an option to do so... I'm not saying or shut up, I'm actually making a suggestion that if that's what you want you can do it...
---
That downloader had an orc in paladin t5 around tbc times
---
&gt; My personal recommendation is to level with Enchanting to get the wands if you're going for speed. Levelling herb later is easy as hell.
---
Ok but he mentioned his prof's so I gave him advice.
---
As a good guy gnome warlock who hands out healthstones like candy, this triggered me.
---
Cause it's not faster as I've already explained. If it was you would see guilds doing it already. They just run 4-5 healers and never stop moving to drink even once.
---
The irony was intentional. 
---
The title was meant to address a common argument where people say that LFG (or any other quality of life tools such as addons) doesnt affect the experience of others because you can simply choose not to use them.
---
Anyway, swing and a miss.
---
the atlas is super sweet! thanks for all the hard work classicwowlive crew
---
Yes, absolutely - the problem lies in figuring out whether the decline began naturally or was caused by the changes. 
---
Every video game has a life cycle and, no matter how good, eventually bleeds players faster than new ones come. This is because there are different types of demographics targeted by different design philosophies (infamous Diablo Immortal is the perfect example of that).
---
At some point the developer has to make a decision:
---
1. Keep targeting same audience = keep same design philosophy and eventually lead to an accelerated decline when you run out of players interested in that particular playstyle
---
2. Target a new audience = change the design philosophy and make sacrifices to bring fresh blood, at the cost of original experience.
---
I don't speak with certainty since it's a lot of guesswork, but my personal opinion is this: making the game faster paced and more convenient led to players staying for longer than they would have, since it delayed the burnout of the old players, which in turn led to a moderate increase in new player acquisition; at the same time, those convenient solutions were the very reason why WoW lost its feel and became an extremely mediocre game with virtually nothing speaking for it other than the universe, addons and unique graphic style. 
---
To me, WoW feels like a westernized asian mmo more than a unique experience anymore. I too believe the game could be phenomenal if they built up on the foundations they set instead of redefining them, but they didn't - most likely because it's harder to justify slow investment when compared to quick fix to a problem, perceived or real.
---
Or perhaps I'm simply biased, since I love games that rip my soul through my butt and feed it back to me if I can't learn them.
---
The best healer I ever played with, I'm talking topping meters while looking at memes on the internet, was a resto drood. Shout out to Lasian
---
weird. I guess the economy on my vanilla server(s) was different. But even farming 80% of my mats for blacksmithing I spent probably 1000g leveling that damn profession. 
---
You mind uh... Dropping the PDF file? xP

I have played pservers at launch they really don't calm down in a few weeks.  Launch day suck but are some of the most exciting things in an MMO.  So I will b the waiting in Q

Unfortunately no 😥

And it is completely fine if every recruit knows this before the guild invite. I wouldn't join a guild like this, but more power to you.

TIL.
---
If you like the totem side of it, you should look up totem twisting. It's a difficult to master aspect of shaman that goes unmentioned a lot of the time.
---
It's not the run back I worry about. It's the repair bill.
---
Then you need to read up on how blizzard releases its games.
---
This is, of course, the biggest dilemma after class choice.
---
I really do not know. Alliance will have significant advantages early on in raiding that the Paladins bring but then Horde tended to have the upper hand in later raids. Of course, I have a life now so can't really end game raid anymore, so perhaps that answers it for me.
---
Undead shadowpriest or Rogue is the next dilemma then.
---
This is kinda hypocritical since there was a lot of kids playing when vanilla came out. Ive seen a lot of posts here about that aswell. Youre becoming old man whos basically saying "back in my day it was better, kids were different" and all that bs. Dont be that guy
---
WHAT DID YOU SAY? I CANT HEAR YOU! THERES 100 TEENAGERS BEING REALLY LOUD HERE!

great feedback. I've not played in over 6 yrs, so thinking what suits my play now. Might even play on PVE for 1st character, then think about another on a PVP one, so I can log in/out as I see fit, if I run into bother. THanks for the detailed reply, I really appreciate it.

Got me a surface book 2 about 8 months ago for work - then our policy changed and we were provided Thinkpads and prohibited from using private devices for work.

I had other uses for it, but now it can be my WoW-Buddy while I relive my teenage years.
---
I played on Dial-up from a farm in Australia. So, every Tuesday night I would stay up late enough to see if there was a patch ( Maintenance was 8pm --&gt; midnight-ish ).
---
If there was a big patch, I would  go to my brothers house in town before school, To start the download on his PC ( he had ADSL in town ).  
---
at school lunch I would go to his house, to burn the updated files to a CD.
---
When I got home, I would start the update, pause it, overwrite the patch files with my CD, then start it again to apply update.
---
People on this forum talk alot about nostalgia; but  I can tell you with absolute conviction... being on Dial-up years after the rest of the world had moved on, was fucked.
---
Played an undead mage, raided and completed upto BWL  and AQ20 finish.
---
Entered MC for the first time at lvl 59 and I remember having very little impact.
---
Good times though!
---
So is Classic.
---
yeah I hear you. Sunken Temple is one I didnt run enough back in vanilla. All the others were brilliant. ZF was great, as was Uldaman and Scarlet M.

My favourite used to be the Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep. A pain in the arse for Hordes, but great layouts and instances. Loved them leveling up.
---
Was also in &lt;The Shattered Star&gt;.
---
im sweating through my eyes... them feels
---
We are not getting a 1.12 client, it’s a 7.3.5 (Legion) client altered to be as close to Vanilla as possible.
---
Absolutely. They might not be as min-maxed as troll, but they're still priests. And WotF is an amazing ability with a large number of PvP and PvE uses. Has saved wipes many times.
---
I gotta do something like this...lol
---
Combat until 34 sub sucks ass until you get CS and KS think blind is around that level too, after mid 30s go hemo and procede as your planning, sub is really really bad if you don't have dirty deeds and stuns.
---
Respec only costs 1g do shouldn't be an issue by then
---
Nochanges so everyone put max 0.5 mbit download to act like ADSL
---
It's the RNG
---
Good RNG, bad RNG. They're equally addictive.
---
Nothing quite like doing the Samophlange quest in the Barrens and dying.  Not only is the corpse run 8 miles long, it requires you to walk around a 500 foot tall mountain. 
---
 Ahhhh the barrens...biggest zone in the game...
---
....2 graveyards.
---
If you're not in a progression guild, you'll be fine without Mana Tide. It's really nice to have, but more casual guilds are looser with builds and you can still make progress even if you aren't optimized.
---
Here, I think you dropped a /s
---
thats an amazing set up! I'll see if my wife fancies trying wow, once I have a level 60 :D
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Probably the eye of sulfuras. I got that before the reckoning nerf and boy it was something else.
---
that's like a 1.2 Mbit connection, that was extremely slow in 2007...
---
I never liked Desolace, but Its been a long time, so will head back for a look ;)
---
So tired of this same one.
---
You're some kind of speedrunner ?
---
Welcome to Redridge *****
---
Hawt Koffee :x
---
reddit subs always go to shit when there's too much attention from people outside of the actual bubble. they can't really participate in anything of substance so they go for what's simple. it feels like more than half of the comments/posts i see are from people who never played classic, never played private servers, but were are drawn in by the tangible hype and are now retelling stories and experiences from others to become a part of it, like little brothers do.
---
The areas by the coast are actually beautiful, and I like all the old ruins everywhere.
---
So just saw this post, I was the guild leader of Blood Brother Alliance side Aerie Peak. :D Warrior called Venna
---
Granted all of this has been private server experience, so the viability of this strat will be in limbo until Classic launches.
---
It is undeniably better, but only if you're specced into deep Ret. A max rank SoC judgement on a stunned enemy is an instant 2K crit, the proc chance is very reliable with a slow weapon, and the proc damage in itself is comparatively high.
---
SoR is only recommended from 1-20, where it is a much better seal than SoTC. As well as 20+ only if you spec into a spellpower heavy build. Which, while it can do very respectable damage, just isn't all that feasible with the debuff limit.
---
Its clear retention is why they adjusted the spawns. However if you look at something like Fortnite, when you die in that game it takes as long as 5min before you drop into another game and maybe another 5min before you see any combat after that.
---
Main one and alt the other. I think Orc is the min-maxed enhancement shaman preference, but others are fine, too. If you're DPS looking for dungeons in vanilla, your best bet is to make the groups yourself. There are just a ton more DPS than tanks/heals so it takes longer to get a group set up.
---
Yeah, that's a good point, economies do vary. Blacksmithing is definitely more expensive because it takes more base mats whereas engineers double dip: one level for making wire, then one level using the wire to make something else.
---
Of level 6s? Or level 10? Just curious because I tried with 2 10s and we were spanked
---
In fairness this is at least higher quality.
---
Out of curiosity what made you print everything off instead of just having a few online docs at the ready?
---
there are memes in every sub, especially at times like now when there's nothing really to talk about because we're all just sitting around waiting for scraps of info. i don't mind them since so far they've all been pretty good, but mods should consider making link flairs so people can tag memes, discussions etc and people can filter out what they don't want to see.
---
Short answer:
---
Undead are most efficient in Pvp.
---
Trolls are most efficient in Pve.
---
Last but not least: Play what looks good to you.
---
This is phrased poorly because one might think it is more than one question.
---
There's literally just as much conversation going on here as there was a few months ago. There are just also more memes.
---
We used to get maybe what, 5-10 posts a day a few months ago? 4-6 of which were re-hashed questions or dumb comments like "DAE remember the blood plague???" "Lupos does shadow damage!!!" with the rest being mostly #nochanges brigades about some issue or another.
---
Now they've released all the info and the #nochange crowd is running out of things to be mad about, since they got almost all of their key demands. The re-hashed questions have been done over and over again, and the sub size has doubled. So, we see an increase in memes. That's how it's going to be till we actually have something to talk about.
---
I don’t think they stated, but i’m sure they’re testing out the sharding before launch to make sure it works.  It worked pretty well in Legion but did take away that community aspect.
---
Seems like they really don’t want to fuck this up since it’s kinda Blizzards last hope.
---
In fairness it’s a stolen meme.
---
Even if you're logging in solo, if Classic is a popular as everyone here thinks it will be there will be tons of people around. Just ask in your zone's general chat if anyone wants to group up for a bit to do leveling.
---
It's a similar trend recurring for every game release in the driest periods of its development, more so for classic, since it's a recreation: It's like talking about the generic HD collections for consoles. 
---
I remember a year ago before BlizzCon 2018, this sub was more deserted, empty and dry of decent content, since Blizzard had been quiet for a very long time. Hell, some people feared the project was discontinued.  
---
Now, when BlizzCon 2018 was done, an unprecedented influx of people joined the subreddit, and activity was blossoming with decent content about the demo and whatnot. 
---
Unfortunately, the reasoning for boring content is simple: No information. A car can't run without fuel.
---
is it though? i mean 3 months is practially eternity..
---
PvP is much less skill dependent than what you might remember: For one, gear is never normalized, then there are the insane amount of consumables which clearly tip a fight to your favor.
---
As such, if you want to delve into PvP, you either have to dedicate considerable time to farm out gear and consumables, or accept the fact that you simply won't beat a player who has those. 
---
Second part is mass pvp: WoW has zero mechanics for diminishing the value of player numbers in raids. As such, the bigger zerg almost always wins.
---
TBC introduced arenas which rebalanced a lot of classes. There is no arena in vanilla and as such there is no balance in small scale pvp. Classes are so asymmetrical that you have minimal chance of beating a player with a class that is a counter to yours.
---
Aggregate this, gears and consumables and you'll see that an owPvP battle is won/lost before the first spell cast.
---
Never said it wasn't lmao.
---
That meme template belongs to the museum.
---
Lmao XD
---
No. I hated vanilla because there were other mmos out which I thought was better (SWG)
---
Now that mmo i thought was comparatively terrible is comparatively excellent when compared to the MMOs of today.
---
Hi, /u/GraniteJohnson
---
I am rolling a Horde lock for my alt and I have the same question. There isn't a wrong answer, but I'm going undead. Lifetap + cannibalize means less downtime while leveling/farming and I prefer active abilities for PvP so WotF gets my vote.
---
Nope. I’m a complete duntz when it comes to speed running heck even with a week off I’ll only probably get to 30-40 with 18h days.
---
I didn't "steal" it. There are billions of people on the planet and you can't comprehend the fact that two individual people had the same idea independently from one another? /u/Falerian1 made this joke in our Discord and I made it into a meme, then they suggested I post it here. I rarely visit here, so I have no idea what is and is not posted.
---
I think you have no clue what im talking about. Using the exaggerated numbers you provided and assuming 28 dps, the % increase is a still less than 3%.
---
There are definitely not billions of people in this subreddit, and you can easily see this as it was only posted 2 days ago. The burden of research falls on you.
---
It's only the installers location which was standard for installing the game at the time
---
The furblog quests are one of the reasons Ashenvale is my favorite zone! The pvp in and around that cave was awesome! Plus the cloth drops!
---
DKP is a hell of a drug.
---
https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/mission.html
---
I actually had 10mb ADSL when wow was released! #SwedishPower.
---
There are optimized answers, but the short answer is: each of you pick what sounds the most fun. It's all viable; it just might not be optimal.
---
For gearing, most gear comes from quests, so there isn't much splitting while you level. If one of you takes leatherworking, you can just make gear to fill in the gaps.
---
My vote would be feral/boomkin with healing gear for dungeons. With tank/heals already taken care of, forming a dungeon group will take no time at all. You can also go feral/feral for minimal downtime while questing/farming. No wrong answers!
---
I was thinking Hand of Rag 2H mace legendary for Ret Pally like we had in my PVP/PVE guild.
---
It seems you're right this was an undocumented change in cataclysm that made spirit regen double when out of combat. Neat.
---
Only to have an error come up and make you redownload to fix it!
---
No, it means that you can only play the game so long you pay 15$/month. If you stop paying 15$/month you won't be able to play anymore. You can unsub and resume playing at a later date, but you will still have to pay 15$/month.
---
Im Swedish aswell and actually had 100/100 thanks to early fiber. However that was not mainstream xD
---
When I first started playing in TBC, my download rate was 400ish kbp/s... how far we've come.
---
It’s a shared sub sooo
---
You just pay the same old 15 month and you get ( both)  
---
Current wow and vanilla wow
---
Night Elf rogue. I was terrible. Still got into ZG with a MH priests mace though.
---
Wow i remember this, with my old internet I needed 2 days to download all the patches, awww good'ol memories.
---
They absolutely will not stand up straight.  Straight standing orcs are an abomination!
---
What is this? Classic TBC?
---
You'll probably fill in off-tank roles and DPS when that isn't needed. If you learn kitty DPS (power-shifting + farming the hell out of Gnomeregan for Manual Crowd Pummeler) you can do legit DPS, though you won't top the meters.
---
I think Best Buy has them too.
---
What's meant by "one sub" is that having a subscription will give you access to current WoW (including Legion content) and Classic. There will be no base game to buy for Classic.
---
It's 5 seconds not 30.
---
60 hunter and 60 warrior - got thunderfury on my warrior right before Naxx release. My buddy who was a ret/holy paladin had hand of rag and we used to cause a ruckus in BRM. The good ol' days.
---
Cause she’s not hot nobody cares that someone is creepy towards them
---
Burden of research? It's a damn silly meme in a sub-reddit filled with silly memes. If you don't like it, or it offends you that it's a duplicate, just hit the down-vote button and move on with your life.
---
I have better things to do than "research" over a silly meme, and I'm damn sure you have better things to be doing than complaining about it.
---
i just have one main plan for my semi-casual leveling which will be: don't go to STV until 38+
---
Theres a mode switcher right at the top of the screen that says classic, and googling questions about vanilla often takes you to the site.
---
So underestimated: fishing + cooking for raid buffs. Amazing gold requiring no special gear or character build.
---
we're one step closer to release and i'm about to break
---
if you go to stv directly after darkshire at like level 30, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
This build doesn't make alot of sense. The theory you're proposing seems reasonable tho, if you just have a weapon swap macro but if you switching a dagger into your inventory its pretty hard to even find 1-2 level appropriate good weapons to use, adding another would be a terrible idea.
---
Theres no real reason to go all the way down and get premeditation, that ability is awful. Deadilness is not a good talent to pick when leveling because it's scaling off of a bonus stat that you don't a high amount of anyway. Setup builds even with full dodge talents just aren't worth the points you spend into them, it only giving you a combo point on under half of you dodges is ridiculously undertuned, you can't force dodges and most mobs when leveling have a 2handed 2sec swing timer even on all dodges you don't get attacked enough to get any real value from it. And to top it all off Improved Slice and Dice is useless when leveling, a sign of an amateur rogue is one that frequently slice and dice while leveling, it's just not versatile enough to be used on every mob and your auto attacks without hit rating and significantly less valuable than at max level. Using your energy on abilities is better because abilities have a much lower chance to be missed/dodged/parried. Improved Eviscerate, Ruthlessness, Relentless Strikes seem pretty mandatory so I don't know why you didn't take any of them, if building combo points with a stealth opener and Setup procs is the goal you're going to be eviscerating more than once per mob. The points 3 points in Ruthlessness would get you awy more combo points and more reliably than the 8 points in setup and 5% dodge.
---
&gt;Priest: Best healer. Always wanted in dungeons and raids. Easy to level too. Great in PvP. Only downside is it has the highest skillcap of healers.
---
I'm wondering about the skillcap here, what makes priests have such a high skillcap? Surely pre-casting is a thing for all healers?
---
I've still got the discs.  Was thinking of posting some pictures of them here for nostalgia.
---
Got through 3 wings of naxx before our guild fell apart. 60 human rogue.
---
Before wow, I was a console player, playing Mega drives, Playstations, game boys, etc.... I didnt play online games. I saw my brother playing wow and it looked amazing! 
---
I rolled a dwarf hunter, and so wanted a big bear, cos of the cinematics in the opening credits.  I'll never forget the awe I had when I first ran into Ironforge and saw hundred of folk running about doing their own things. It was truly epic feel to it.
---
They said on Blizzon that they would change the way macros work to prevent these automation macros/addons.
---
I expect that macros follow the new WoW pattern. But I don't know if they'll have things like focus, mouseover, etc... or if they'll manually remove/change it since it was not a part of vanilla.
---
That’s a shame. Kind of wish they made a deal where you can play less money and just play classic. Like 7.99 or something like that.
---
It only changes xp
---
I can't imagine not having 2 screens during vanilla lol
---
Going with a 30/0/21 build on the shaman keeps your chain lightning hitting like a truck. You aren't as good a healer in raids, but you don't miss out on much and as long as you're in a casual raiding guild you won't have any trouble. With that build, you can farm whatever you want. Just get water from a mage because elemental shaman are thirsty.
---
29 twinking was the best in TBC imo. finding all those quest items that are level 35 to use TBC enchants was good fun and super OP at that level lol
---
An elemental shaman, Enhancement shaman or shadow priest would be rather happy dishing out 250-300 DPS, it's not an exaggerated number at all this is about the ballpark where they land (unless we're talking fully naxx geared players, but I assume we aren't instead this is BWL gear considered) meanwhile the warriors are absolutely able to dish out over 1k DPS so long as the tanks threat permits it.
---
Your comment makes no sense however, using my "exaggerated" numbers of 250 DPS versus 1000 DPS and then assuming 28 DPS (wat) the % increase is 3...?
---
It's vanilla: main one and alt the other. 
---
Priest is best everything.
---
Git gud, stream get wow-days donations
---
Yes, thanks for the criticism I will edit the main post.
---
“You belong in a museum”
---
In fact paper industry is much less polluting than data centers. He is saving the planet.
---
when you're running along a ghost from the other faction and you realize that both your corpses are near each other
---
Honestly sunken temple is a pretty terrible dungeon in classic.  You go there and do your quests and then never return.  There's so much trash it takes forever plus it's super easy to get lost even if you have a map open on another screen.
---
Running up to Ironforge, hearing the music change and then getting past the main gates to see everyone around the AH and bank was truly epic!
---
Getting a 2h and having your guy leaning to the side. Lol. Miss it.
---
Screenshot is from a former &lt;Sadface&gt; guildmate, of the Malygos (US) server. I have a few screenshots of C'Thun dead, but this is the lowest % screenshot I have with the UI, which I think is a lot more fun.
---
seems to be only valid for US accounts (I'm Canadian and it said I'm not eligible)
---
Yes and no.  I didn't hit 60 until after TBC.
---
Our VCR reminder was deafeningly loud.  I can't count how many times I popped in a tape and someone had forgotten to rewind it.  
---
Or how many times I thought someone had forgotten and I wound the tape to the end before starting it up.
---
&gt; Who installs WoW to C:/?
---
This comment was made by the dedicated for wow nvme ssd gang
---
But this is the 2.0 client
---
Listen, friend, I’m sure you have better things to do than either photoshop an image, or just save someone else’s work in an attempt to get fake internet points. I know you think memes are just silly photos, and you’ll grow out of that, but some people spend time making these things. They don’t do that so people can just take the work as their own. Maybe your “silly meme” is better suited in /r/memes, because here it’s clutter.
---
Haha not really, we were quite late with fiber here. That's the life living outside of a city. Blaming the Swedish politicians deciding to go for high speed ADSL rather than fiber in the 90s.
---
Now me and my GF have 100/100 and we're below average even out here lol. But we don't see a reason to go higher =)
---
That’s not what I was saying but ok
---
Technically spellbatching is not an engine error, but still an engine limitation, same as 16debuffs.
---
They could easily enable unlimited debuffs and nigh instant spell batches, yet they decided against it.
---
I honestly hope they keep the increased range... as I'm tauren myself.
---
Kids back in the day were much different players. We grew up with the Diablo 2 &amp; EverCrack grinds. Kids today seek instant gratification &amp; entitlement (thus the direction of every game)....  Worst if all, kids are a lot more toxic online today then they were 15 years ago.
---
Druids aren't bad. Druids are not optimal. 
---
You're going to spend a **lot** of time with your character in WoW. If you love the class fantasy, that'll make the journey more enjoyable. You can farm easily as feral. You can level easily as feral. You can tank and DPS as feral. You are a good healer as Resto. And you can be a thirsty dancing lazer turkey as balance.
---
If you like the class, play the class. It's a long game. Enjoy it.
---
Thank you for your contribution.
---
This very thing happened to me! Beyond infuriating!
---
And feline mantle! Name a better duo I'll wait.
---
No. That's not how math works.
---
&gt; I mained a mage for a long time, and it was a blast
---
heh
---
True, they muscles are to weak to hold the weapon. I really would like to tank tho. Maybe a undead priest to heal. So many possibilities.
---
Any misconceptions about mages?
---
Hahah :)
---
I DI warriors tho when I’m in 5 mans to help save them a little bit as well when we wipe. Also gives them a chance to afk while we hike back without needing Rez
---
Might as well put resistance stacking alongside spell pen.
---
wrooooooooooooooooooong
---
i'll play a dwarf, and will travel over to darkshore at lvl ~12 and after that ashenvale/stonetalon. I love those zones, and it's a nice bonus that i can fight some horde there as well :)
---
You do remember correctly. It was stated by game director Ion Hazzikostas during the "Restoring History: Creating WoW Classic" Blizzcon panel.  
---
[You can watch the relevant sequence here.](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2495)

Any source on 2 hours respawn timer on devilsaur? LOL
---
Here's a complete vanilla warrior tanking guide: sunder armor.
---
Oh bummer. Sorry, dude.
---
I started playing around 2006 as a free trial. My first character was a Gnome Mage. The rest is history, frankly. 
---
Bought a real subscription during TBC but never made it to end game content. Really hit my stride in WoTLK.
---
For sure. Im overkilling it with 1000 now. Id be fine with 100 still tbh. ADSL is still going strong I might add. Inside info ;-)
---
Play a gnome warlock. Get better horse. Done.
---
Wiping in Uldaman sucks because you can get lost everywhere, even before the instance
---
What do you guys think is more important, faction or individual race? 
---
I prefer alliance as a whole, and think Orgrimmar is horrible looking. However, I rate individual horde races like Troll and Tauren higher than Human. 
---
I remember playing WoD and through most of it I was Alliance and I loved the Garrison. But then I race changed horde and it was miserable.
---
Just did some Google searching. I was in &lt;Unrivaled Dominion&gt;
---
This one made me laugh because my first toon was horde back in vanilla and I've been playing alliance for a while
---
when i was lvling on a pserver i went from elwynn to westfall and then doing just a tiny bit of questing in redridge, then straight to duskwood, redridge was a horde gankfest, with the bridge being near impossible to pass somethimes.
---
Also i don't really enjoy redridge, plus as a warlock soloing the early stages is somewhat possible, and if you grind a bit and get some gear then it's ez
---
Just the sheer breadth of their abilities. They got multiple types of heals for multiple situations....all of which should be downranked for efficient mana usage. Dispels, defensive buffs, fear ward, shadow weaving etc. A master priest has so much to do and arguably more efficient ways of doing it in every single instance. No other healer class has nearly as much stuff to master. Druids are hard because of their limitations and you have to learn to work around them. Shamans are ALMOST as complex as the Priest but not quite.....Paladin is just straight up easy.
---
Didn't steal it. Literally took 10 seconds to combine two images: [https://i.imgur.com/kEh3E14.png](https://i.imgur.com/kEh3E14.png)
---
They won't, [Sauce](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2495)
---
Oh certainly and that's the beauty of it, we both have different playstyles and can conform to what suits us, both left to our own devices to make our own experience the best it could be.
---
I'm mostly crusading against the mentality of "it's old easy content we can do it blindfolded, if you bar subpar specs from raiding you're an asshole." Sure, but we're not looking at the same goal. Said person wants to get to every boss and kill every boss, which is certainly possible albeit varying degrees of frustrating with a meme raid comp, it absolutely isn't possible creating mega fights with trash+boss, multiple bosses or the likes however.
---
I thought the same thing about a youtube video I made a week ago.  The response blew my mind.
---
Never underestimate this sub when it comes to clicking on things related to Classic wow.
---
A lot of people also straight up lie. The amount of people i've met in my time playing wow who claimed to have played classic but actually didn't is insane. 
---
Not saying this is the case with this sub but usually people are fucking liars.
---
Same.  I left it blank
---
Naw it's more like, not every guild is a hard core raiding guild trying to break records so stop trying to scare away genuinely new players by trying to tell them they can't raid unless they play what you want them to.
---
See my other posts in this thread for the source, but tl;dr these addons won't work in Classic.
---
One of the things so appealing to me about WoW was that dying was a dream compared to Everquest.  You didn't lose hours of work you just lost minutes of times.
---
It is more of a game changer if you make it one by playing your warrior the way it's supposed to  be played: with a solid mate.
---
With a swingtimer you can finish your swing, make sure your mate is ready to disengage when you peel. You warstomp, your shaman buddy casts cleanse on himself, is now out of range from that pesky rogue while crippling just got cleansed off.
---
Peeling as tauren is quite solid.
---
I still deem orc warrior superior to tauren, however I'm more of an RPer when it comes to races, so I make the best out of the advantages.
---
To build even further on this, there are also enough zones (particularily in the 1-40 range) that you can skip a few of them and still have enough places to quest that you won't have to do any grinding. For example as horde I usually skip both silverpine and hillsbrad completely, and on alliance I usually skip wetlands. Don
---
There is no right answer. Vanilla is a long game and you're going to spend a lot of time with your character. Class fantasy matters more than any of the expansions. If you like it, play it.
---
If you liked shadow priest, play one. They're perfectly viable. They might not be as optimal as other options, but so what? You're obviously not going for a hardcore raiding guild, so optimal is irrelevant. Casual guilds just need to fill the roster with people they like to play with and who will figure out their own class.
---
If you're considering lock vs. mage, think about what you liked so much about the shadow priest. If you want to recreate that feel, then go lock (that's what I'm rolling for my alt and my main is going to be a holy priest).
---
I'd say Hardiness is better than WotF for any class except rogue who has no innate counters to fear and whose PvP trinket is pretty bad (charm, fear, polymorph--the three least common forms of CC). And even then, it's pretty even. Stun resist is quite nice when neither your class nor your trinket can remove stuns, but I'd lean slightly toward WotF for rogues because it targets two classes that rogues really want to be going after. All other orc-able classes should go orc where PvP is concerned.
---
Warriors have such strong counters to fear that there's no need for WotF, and warlocks are so vulnerable to stuns and melee that they should favor Hardiness. It resists not just conventional stuns but also grenades, which is absolutely huge. Grenades are one of the most frequent deciders of fights, and if you can resist one in four, you've got a huge blanket advantage against literally all classes.
---
You get stunned so much more often than you get feared, and almost no classes have real counters to stun (dispelling the HoJ off someone isn't really *countering a stun*). Most classes can stun. Some can stun you repeatedly in a short window of time, some can stun you for a really long time, some will randomly proc stuns on their attacks/spells. There's even a racial ability that stuns. 
---
There's only three sources of fear, one of which is a warrior shout that doesn't get used quite as much. Priest fear is on a longish cooldown. Well, I guess there's hunter beast fear if you're a feral druid, but let's leave that alone. Point is, there's *tons* of stuns in the game and really rather few sources of fear.
---
Anytime I play an undead that could have been an orc, I always regret it when it turns out that WotF only even has a use against two and a half classes. Every time I get hit with a grenade, I want there to be a 25% chance to resist it and just outright win the fight on the spot. Same for CS, KS, HoJ, Bash. When you resist one of those, you pretty much just win. Resisting a Blackout, Intercept or Impact might not immediately swing a fight but is still extremely nice. While you often swing the fight if you counter a fear with WotF, it has a longish cooldown and only seriously matters against two classes. You just get so much more mileage out of Hardiness.
---
Gonna quest out the first two starting zones, skip the crowded ones where I can't get a group, or elites where I can't get a group and then grind the rest of the way. I will probably stop grinding to pick up quests/quest chains for blue items that I'll need at 60 and then keep grinding for my epic mount.  
---
Then I'll take some selfies in STV if I'm feeling kinda cute, might go ganking later IDK
---
Yeah they were definitely the TOP Alliance guild early on. I would recognize some of the more active members names from it I'm sure. I had a buddy Fitty that PVPed with them a lot in the organized ranking groups. They pretty much controlled who got Rank 14 each week.
---
Regal Mantle with Robes of the Lich. And don’t forget the Regal wizard hat with +5 pimpness.
---
Even though Windows XP (I guess) interface is awful, look at this finesse. From that hand-drawn NE character to font selection everything is here carefully and thoughtfully designed.
---
And what we have now? Super duper 3d models? Yeah whatever
---
Probably just going to follow Joana's guide.
---
&gt; A lot of people also straight up lie. The amount of people i've met in my time playing wow who claimed to have played classic but actually didn't is insane.
---
Most of the Classicast, lol.
---
Most hardcore guilds*
---
With the exception of Gloom Weed, maybe.
---
A lot of those aren’t really aoe farms, they are something a hunter would be able to farm more efficiently too
---
I keep saying this, but it's worth repeating: if you're going to be in a casual guild, then play what you want. They usually just try to fill out the rosters with people who enjoy playing and who will try to learn their class. If you like shadow priest, play it. You'll find something.
---
Someone call the police!
---
every class has viable raid specs. dont have to be hc to respec. encouraging unviable specs in raids is like saying its okay to use an SMG to try to shoot someone in an FPS game from half a mile.
---
This is cute
---
Sort of necroing this...
---
Being that you played an NE Druid, did you have a difficult time against shaman in pvp? From what I remember their purges and burst were especially nasty against druids. Is it that much of a detriment that rolling tauren would be better/easier?
---
legion launch shards were fair, it was possible to quest but often you needed a group for quests where the mobs were camped. Rarely a quest was super overcrowded, only one comes to my mind (fuck you Huln).
---
BfA is another story, the shards were MASSIVELY overcrowded, especially the beginnings of a zone took lots of time because things died a second after spawning
---
Oh, sweet. I remember watching this how could I forget lol. I'll edit my original comment. Thank you.
---
I want a build that is good in wpvp as i level.
---
Im tryin stuff in a private server and im loving ambush + backstab dmg so far
---
Grinding is faster IMO unless you're some kind of pro that knows a perfect path. A lot of quests have you running around all over the place and you have to compete for named mobs or just mobs that have a shitty drop rate and there's not enough spawned.  I'm with you - pop on some good music or a movie and grind the fuck out of a zone. The rest of you can thank me later for keeping the spider population down or whatever.
---
Undead. Get level 18 and then be stuck in Silverpine forever because it's so beautiful in vanilla. It's my favorite zone, ruined many times over the course of several expansions.
---
The Sons of Arugal beckon.
---
Try to time your grounding totem against good casts instead of just pre dropping it.
---
And if you want to be really optimal, try to use grounding totem against cooldown casts and earth shock for non cooldown casts.
---
For instance, if you interrupt scare beast, the hunter will be able to cast it right after the 6 second interrupt window. But if you gound it, his cast won't be interrupt, it'll go off but be absorbed, so the hunter have to wait the whole 30 seconds cooldown on it (sorry I couldn't think of a better example now, but I think you got it)
---
Went for 500 a few years back. Was cool to download games in matter of minutes. But meh, like. Overkill.
---
I do wish to upgrade to 250 next time Bahnhoff reduces their prices :D
---
Kinda wish there was a delay on MC/Ony. Like two months. Less pressure to speedlevel and the gear disparity won't be as big early on.
---
I started in April of 2005 on Zul'Jin horde side.
---
First character was a Tauren warrior and got to level 30 when the friend I was playing with wanted to try Alliance. That is when I started playing on Warsong - Alliance and leveled a warlock which I got to level 43. That is when I realised I did not like being a caster so I started leveling an other warrior and god did I enjoy it.
---
Got to level 60 maybe arround september and started to tank in dungeons and realised I really loved having the responsibility of being a tank.
---
Long story short, I started to take the game really seriously and I eventually became main tank of the guild I was part of. We cleared up to Princess Huhuran in AQ40 before preparing ourselves for the next expansion (Farming gold, PVP gear to complete my DPS set with Grand marshall gear being accessible). 
---
I'm planning on playing a warrior for Classic. Tanking is the goal but given that real life at 17 years old and 31 is not the same I would normally aim for being DPS, but having had the chance to weild Thunderfury back in Vanilla leads to the bigger part of me wanting to have a chance to a second one.
---
I picked RP, since if there are no RP-PvP servers we'll prolly roll RP anyway.
---
Yet people laugh at the WoW style and I see a lot of folks who want to bring back the EQ style.
---
I was not with them for their server firsts but joined shortly after through a friend and raided a lot with them. I also just found Apedog's name online who was an infamous horde pvper who was a pain in my ass 😆. Oh man this takes me back !!
---
Again, low effort memes are clutter.
---
I have it due to employment. 250 is probably the sweetspot.
---
Whenever people say they love fishing, I just don't get it!
---
How can you enjoy waiting on a 30secs bobber doing nothing :O?!
---
But getting free food is always awesome!
---
TBC at least , 2 draenei behind
---
The thing is, we know very little about Classic still at this point so really there is not much to discuss other than people's preparations and anticipations to the game being release.
---
Thats probably why ppl just revel in memes mostly atm.
---
Were I the raid leader, I'd kick that guy in an instant. No brainer.  
---
You can top meters all you want by abusing scripts/addons designed with that specific goal in mind, but if you can't do prove yourself mechanically skilled, you have no place in a raid imho.  
---
Best example would be the healer he followed making a mistake and causing his death by not moving away from an aoe fast enough (as you follow a meter or two behind the other guy and not exactly on top of him while he's moving), which could easily have been avoided where the guy at least trying to play. And on some fights, you can't afford raid healers to die.
---
PvP server so, right away at launch. Planning to go alliance, but if that changes I'm going right to the barrens to yell "chuck norris!"
---
bosses were balanced with the debuff limit in mind though
---
at launch.
---
People keep saying 'oh it'll be a bad launch' and yet every game launch or expansion launch blizz has done since cataclysm has been smooth as fuck with very few issues so I don't really see it happening here.
---
It also gets you familiar with the layout dungeons and raids.
---
Ah yes, we reached complete enlightenment.
---
This topic just only shows the 2 extremes though. Either you go in full tryhard min/maxer, or you want to raid with a moonkin with questing greens. 
---
The truth is most players want to be effective, but don't have the time to farm gold for the constant respecs, so they use hybrid specs which are good for raiding and pvp as well. And that is a completely different usecase.
---
Hey - person that runs Wowhead here. That is the case - access to a Classic beta should clear up the remaining red/obsolete text, remove (obsolete) names on quests, and update NPC/maps locations :)
---
I just rank 1 moonfire the shaman when I see the grounding buff icon on him.
---
__Chuck Norris is a national treasure.__
---
you would of had better FPS without the unnecessary fancy UI modifications
---
So how exactly do you do it then? Do we have to drop the profession and skill it up again, or is there a way to shed the spec without sheding the profession?
---
Legendary.
---
You won’t need consumables every fight
---
Brings down the sub to $11 a month.  Not bad.
---
not really.
---
You don't seem to understand the #nochanges philosophy.
---
Every class that is going to raid needs potions and consumables. So thats not really the anwser his is looking for. But ok.
---
I remember you guys! I was in Sui Generis :)
---
Your unarmed skill has increased to 27.
---
Good not
---
this
---
No!
---
At launch; there might be a que to login, but it'll be like 2 hours MAX, there won't be ques to kill mobs, because the starter zones will be sharded.
---
I'm doing a lvl 30 in 30 hours challenge so I can get ahead and beyond the reach of tourists
---
'little'
---
The other guy saidnit best. Slice and dice is pretty worthless whilst levelling. You're best off sticking to combat swords, sounds like you're trying to reinvent the wheel a bit.
---
Wrong. A BoP item vendors for only a fraction of what an equivalent BoE item could be purchased for on the AH, making most BoP gear multiple times more valuable to a person who can equip it vs someone who is just going to vendor it. A BoE item on the other hand is worth the exact same to anyone regardless of their class.
---
Again this is total bs claim.
---
Xbox live came out in late 2002 and its famous for being full of toxic kids. Fucking counterstrike was toxic af. Theres tons of raging videos on youtube from ventrilo from that time. People like you claim that everything in their time was better without actually taking time to take things in perspective. Id rather have a kid in my guild than old man saying that the beatles are better than todays music.
---
I mean, they call it a "mission". They've just failed it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It's not hard to re-balance them. It would almost entirely involve just raising the bosses health.
---
2 60 warriors, 2 60 priests, rogue, and druid. The druid may have hit 60 during the tbc pre-patch so I don't know if that one counts.
---
I played a lot of vanilla... 😅
---
As a shadow priest I love it when shamans take the time to spam purge. I use low rank buffs and let them have their way while I blast and dot, then silence fear, blast flay and dead shaman.  It's annoying as heal spec 1v1 though, but generally you have to know this is coming.
---
haha yeah at the other end of the beach to the south of BFD
---
Even IF I wanted the game changed,  I still wouldn't want this.
---
&gt;hat community aspect.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Seems like they really don’t want to fuck this up since it’s kinda Blizzards last hope.
---
WoW is one helluva drug :)
---
I'm enjoying myself on a server which shall not be named right now. Also playing through DA:I as I never finished it.
---
You will spend a lot of time getting ganked and dying when you'd rather be leveling.  You will often be killed unfairly by douchebags who outlevel you or gangbang you with 5 other people or asshole rogues who wait till you're 1/2 hp with 2 mobs on you before they attack.  
---
This is the way of the pvp server and you need to accept that going in.
---
The beauty of it is that this means the achievement of actually getting to 60 is far more rewarding because of how much harder it is to do.
---
I hated back then how Blizz used p2p, I thought it was so cheap to not have a dedicated server for deploying patches. Not only this, but my ISP at the time blocked/throttled p2p traffic because they thought the only people who used it were people who pirated.
---
The influence of "external" things in PvP. Looks like others have already commented on this too. See below
---
I.E. if you get out of a raid and have full buffs/world buffs and zone into a BG you will probably start one shotting people. 
---
Engineering vs No engineering. So many advantages with engineering in PvP such as helm/trinkets/grenades. Might not matter much in premades but having an extra stun just because of your profession can sometimes make or break fights. 
---
Also: "Gimmicks" Low level things that you think might not be useful just because they are low level. I.E. Tidal charm, skull of impending doom. These things are also useful in PvP that might be dismissed otherwise. "How the F does this person keep breaking my sheep?!"
---
These things were pretty much all removed in TBC. But in vanilla......
---
That’s true, sometimes I can spam low level seals and get them spamming purge and caught in a global mess but that makes for an incredibly slow fight w/ one handed no seal autoattacking lol
---
Yeah this.  Blizz hopefully will avoid making the same train wreck mistake.
---
I do understand that people do not want any changes. I somewhat agree with that but also think that it is both impossible, and may be too inflexible a position to take.
---
blizz too smart to sell themselves short like that
---
:(
---
Can confirm, I struggle to choose between the three for these exact reasons
---
Risk of Rain 2 at the moment. Early access but the game is amazing.
---
doesn't that get resisted?
---
No lol no it was not. You just had a good connection I guess.
---
Xperl was around in vanilla?
---
Says it was posted on the 24
---
Oooo you are swaying me a little,  damn I'm torn!
---
F5.
---
I agree, though I think I recognize that Classic being "pure" is whats needed for the time being. 
---
A Classic+ server would be wonderful down the line when Classic has hit 1.12 for a good while, there's plenty of useful changes that could address what is really an unfinished, sloppy game.
---
Debuff limit, Class tuning &amp; Tier/Dungeon set itemization are the first things that come to mind. Nothing hugely gamechanging, wouldn't actually change the core feel of the game.
---
Oddly enough, I started playing retail. Leveling a new race class and faction on a new server with no heirlooms just to enjoy the story and scratch that itch
---
Yeah I really enjoy sub leveling, I wish it was the best. I'd recommend something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGx00xZGcV0bZVMjcc0o)
---
get 2/2 Remorseless Attacks first, then go get imp backstab from sub, then go get imp ambush then fill out assass. Get imp sprint whenever if you're too sick of mages, but you definitly wanna get it at some point for world pvp. And the 5% Hit is really nice for leveling anyway so you don't lose much from going down to get it. Hopefully facestabing works in classic but imp sinister strike is good just incase you're about to overcap and can't get behind the target. 
---
Unfortunitly lethality doesn't affect ambush but it will still affect your backstabs and eviscerates which is the rest of your damage. You can fill out sub before assassination if you want less damage and more utility. You'll beat every mage with 2 sprints that both break frost nova. I've leveled 6 rogues in vanilla and Imp Ambush + Imp Backstab + Lethality was by far the funnest, I also knew a guy who ranked while he was leveling on a server launch with that build, but he had a mage with him for perfect setups.
---
Nice counterargument.
---
Sekiro!! But I finished it two days ago... What now? :(
---
I think they'll ramp up the marketing once they have a solid release date they feel they can stick to.
---
By design memes aren't original, they're lazy and repetitive.
---
It‘s just something to do in between other things. It‘s relaxing, you get other people walking by chatting you up. Just last week I was fishing Nightfin off Feathermoon Island, and some guy walked past on his way to the mainland, asked me if I caught anything nice yet. So we talked about fishing, cooking, fishing spots that are safe from ganking. I ended up sending him my spare Big Iron Fishing Pole in the mail later and he responded thanking me and telling me how it had brought him luck, him catching a 34 pound redgill on the fourth try.
---
I remember you guys as well! :)
---
So do you!
---
I suppose Faction is most important, because that’s where you spend most of your time. Yes, you may enjoy Trolls, but being Horde means you’ll be spending a lot of time in Kalimdor, Orgrimmar, and around the other Horde races. 
---
Both Factions have a very unique feel to them. Not only with your individual character but the characters, zones, and themes around you. I recommend picking the Faction you prefer first, then deciding your race/class combination from there
---
Osrs for that early 2000s feel
---
I don't think, I KNOW you're underestimating the popularity of MMORPGs right now. Look at retail, it's just dropping lower and lower every expac, so low that they stopped reporting sub numbers. Other MMOs are struggling to hit a million.
---
MMOs in general are very niche; super slow and grindy MMOs are even more niche. I'd be surprised if we hit 200-300k active subs after the initial rush / tourists die down.
---
Any ranged can solo you just kite him around the mountain. I don’t even think you will need vanilla leashing to make it work in case they go that route. Or you could always try the kite him around the fence trick but no way that pathing will be on live. Either way it’s a good enough reward you can 100% find a group for it
---
I see you are a man of Dwarfture as well.
---
Spell pen gear CV in vanilla? The fuck you smokin dude
---
I'm not at all convinced that Blizzard ever actually considered the debuff limit in their balancing :D Plus, the balance that they crafted 15 years ago is already blown out of the water with private server meta advancements and just by general optimization of raid compositions. Allowing some more leeway in those optimizations would not necessarily be a bad thing in my opinion.
---
Maybe you should apply for a job at blizzard then, show 'em how it's done
---
oh fuck, Shrek 2?
---
BDO, pservers &amp; darkest dungeon
---
Respect for citing your source! Great info, thanks!
---
I never killed cthun or most of naxx in vanilla retail. Hopefully I can this time around.
---
&gt; too inflexible
---
That's the point. It shouldn't be flexible at all.
---
I'm gonna drink in that Classic WoW like Tormund drinks Milk.
---
And abilities/itemization thanks to raid makeup. There's no 1 hard and fast rule for raid slots.
---
You can't just flat increase boss health without combing over all abilities and itemization thanks to the slotting of classes in a raid. Maybe you're heavy on DOTs or vice versa.
---
The web of "more health" spreads in multiple directions and will have an impact on other areas of PVE and PVP.
---
Leave it alone.
---
this 100%
---
I'm always surprised how few shamans seem to realise they have purge and/or don't know which classes they should 100% be spamming it on in fights.
---
Put that disk in its' case you heathen.
---
I actually think that subs will go higher than the current mature user base.  The formula in Vanilla and TBC was working.  Growth obviously started to slow so Blizz got too crafty by changing up too many of the game's mechanics, hoping to sustain that growth, and %#*$'ed things up.
---
What they should have focused on is securing a large population of a stable user base and focused on retention vs growth.
---
If I was Blizz, I would rather milk 6 million monthly subs for profit vs chasing microtransactions on a 2 million user base where you keep losing subs because the game sucks.
---
Build a quality and engaging game with the right formula, and they will come.  Make it a never ending game in its current state, and they will stay.
---
This
---
Has my vote for the best 10-20 zone. Such a great atmosphere. And SFK is a great way for new players to learn the game because it's actually a challenge in Vanilla.
---
Thank you for posting, surprised not everyone has heard this yet.
---
&gt; blown out of the water with private server meta advancements
---
Good thing no one is forcing you to follow any of the metas
---
Luna unit frames isn't exactly like this but it certainly is a crutch modern players use that would have made raid MUCH easier back then.
---
If I could just get my game to stop going into stop motion gameplay during raids I will be happy. PC and internet can easily handle wow but at points in a raid it just dies for a few minutes. Maybe it is a mod, I only play on using bartender(if available), dbm and maybe decursive(if available)
---
I'll be working my way up Eastern Kingdoms while you're working down.
---
I plan to start a Dwarf Priest, Dun Morogh -&gt; Loch Modan -&gt; Wetlands -&gt; Arathi Highlands -&gt; Hiinterlands -&gt; Western Plaguelands -&gt; Eastern Plague lands. Hopefully by the time Eastern Plaguelands is finished I'll be 60. I also plan to do this with a duo partner.
---
I'm hoping to get and stay ahead of the Alliance leveling wave.
---
I was even able to recover my old acc through the keys :)
---
Classic is bringing back Vanilla, to preserve it how it was. It doesn't aim to be "better". If you want to play Vanilla, good. If you don't like how Vanilla plays, sorry.
---
Brack: "This is an important game in videogame history and there’s not a way to go back and experience that today. This is also about preserving something that we think is really important."
---
What really makes a bad tank is the DPS. Seriously. This game is older than a dinosaur fart and people still don't give tanks time to get aggro on pservers, or don't attack skull or CC their targets.  No matter what class/spec at least in 5 mans and UBRS, I've ran with warriors, druids, and pallys as tanks and EVERY class CAN ABSOLUTELY TANK and do a good job IF
---
1. Targets are marked and DPS hits the correct target
---
2. CC is used and not broken
---
3. DPS gives time for tank to get aggro
---
I've had great tanks that have had the rug pulled out from under them because they are doing EVERYTHING they can, but some stupid ass DPS screws the whole thing up.
---
 \- rogue gets cute and tries to stealth too far ahead
---
\- someone breaks sheep
---
\- someone breaks shackle
---
\- someone's pet goes potato into a group of mobs
---
\- someone follows the tank too far forward when she's setting up for a pull and aggros the whole place
---
9/10 bad tanking is due to retarded DPS
---
Sincerely,
---
Geared Healer
---
I hit 63 with my Hunter which had about /played 75 days in vanilla wow before I stopped playing.
---
Then later on i rolled a Shaman Draenei loved the first part of the Draenei changed to my hunter when I hate 25 with my Shaman. Lvled it to 70 Didn't like it that much tho I was just playing with friends from school.
---
Then I came back again for WOTLK which I really liked and played A LOT.
---
After that I tried almost every expansion and got more disappointed everytime.
---
Only issue tanking ZG as a paladin is berserkers, those are going to be really annoying. At least the warrior OT can mostly solo them when he got CDs up.
---
Warlocks already do an insane amount of damage. Do we really want them doing THAT much more damage? The dps disparity between classes/specs can already be huge. We don't need to widen the gap further to the point where people just stack like 20 warlocks.
---
Do you get flagged automatically in an enemy zone on a PvE server?
---
https://youtu.be/E0J7tezZvTY
---
There are no diminishing returns on cc in classic.
---
You’d  basically have to redesign the entire vanilla raid content since most of it can be gimped if you don’t have any debuff limit.
---
A)
---
It requires a lot of changes. If you do this, then the overall dps of the raid would be increased, that needs to be fixed.
---
B) Your argument that more dps to good dps means they get threatcapped isn't really valid. Because if this is the case, then some sort of bleed spec would be good on a tank giving them even more threat. Impale deepwounds tank would probably be meta which doesn't really change much.
---
C) The problem with shitty specs is not that they are dot heavy, it's that they are poorly designed. 
---
Affliction warlock is already a thing, it's called SM ruin, and giving extra debuff slots would just mean that they can use corruption which they often already can with 16 slots.
---
How far away should we get from a historical recreation project and into making WoW Classic +?
---
Sure skip Wetlands, but skipping Westfall is a mistake.
---
Incorrect
---
Buddy up with a warrior for DME jump runs or spamming dungeons. The two of you are crazy together but weak on your own, just like when leveling.
---
The beauty of Classic is leveling takes a long time. Because of this you’re going to find tons of other people out in the world, and it’s normal for people to invite each other to groups and give buffs when questing in the same area.
---
It won’t be like you see in BFA where there are maybe 5 people in each low level zone. The zones in Classic will be packed, and not only at launch. It takes weeks (or more) of dedicated play to reach 60, and that will ensure that there will always be a steady stream of people in each of the leveling zones
---
Darkest dungeon best game ever!
---
Mmm wow insider
---
It's a 2 second interrupt window on earth shock in classic btw (but ES is on a 4 sec cooldown only).
---
Its just a rly bad movie . half past dead with steven seagal i guess
---
This! Especially if you had plate armor (I think those had higher repair cost?).
---
Omg I love this! I've started something similar for my planned warlock. 
---
Could you please give me a break down of what sections you've included? I can see a list of bis items you want, planned professions. What else do you have in there??
---
it wont, MC doesnt drop a lot of good gear, and the few really good pieces will be luckdrops anyways.
---
I think this is why I've reconciled to play a rogue instead of warrior. Having main tanked vanilla for a long time, the sheer amount of non-raiding time you have to put into the game to just be able to afford a progression raid is staggering.
---
Managing expectations for me has been as much about realising that as I now have a life, I can't really raid endgame. My best hope is to find a nice guild who have plenty of people happy to run 5mans of a Friday evening.
---
I only have 1 week of vacation that I already used this year because I work at a typical evil American third world dictator business that pays poverty wages. 
---
Even without vacation time I look forward to have Azeroth to take me away from my miserable job.
---
The new one is huge and it’s honestly kinda hard to use. The best replacement I’ve found is the Redragon Perdition (for me at least). I just had one die after about 3 years of use, so I bought 3 more. I’ve found it works perfectly for me, and the ergo is even good for FPS and other such games where having a rather large bulbous mouse isn’t conducive to playing well. The kicker is, they’re ~$35.
---
Group grinding the elite dwarves in the bottom corner of Hillsbrad was pretty effective. I love those seemingly misplaced elites that you'd just happen upon and be like, "I should not be here. Run. Running away."
---
Every class would benefit from the debuff limit being removed and every class would suffer. The amount of crazy consumables vanilla requires for peak performance is extremely high but with no debuff limit any item applying any damage increase at all would be fair game. Solid example, [Gift of Arthas](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9088) would be instantly required for every boss in every raid.
---
You are right, shock's interrupt window is smaller because the cooldown is smaller too. I edited it :p
---
Exactly!! Every GCD makes the shaman more fried chicken, the real challenge is timing on silence and fear. Fear might not work either because of tremor, bust for the most part it’s not an issue. But you don’t want them healing back up. Doesn’t take much time to melt someone so GCDs are awesome.
---
It honestly reminds me of the Soulsborne series, a lot of the time the run backs can take longer than the boss itself. It lets you decompress and evaluate what you've done right and clearly wrong since you're dead haha.
---
When the top comment has more upvotes than the actually post.
---
&gt; Chases you across the map just to buff you.
---
That's me, I'm a healing slut down to the bone!
---
Kotor2, one of the best RPGs out there to this day.
---
Agreed on people blowing Hardiness way out of proportion. People treat it as if it’s 100%. 4 strength 4 stam leather belt unghhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Well then show respect for the rest of your shelf and throw it out the window.
---
Chuck Norris went into McDonalds and ordered a whopper...and got one!
---
I think they want to see if folks will come back to Vanilla before they market it.
---
Then it doesn't matter if it's delayed a bit.
---
But it does have good gear. Especially ony. Every piece that drops will get used, and only those that could nolife launch will benefit.
---
I just think it makes sense from a community standpoint to have it delayed a bit.
---
So sah mein Schrank auch aus :D
---
Lmao. This’ll be quite real this time in Classic 😄
---
I grew up in the Bay Area in California, 30ish minutes from San Francisco. However, where I lived was about 5 miles down a dead end canyon road that was very sparsely populated. We had dial-up as our only option all the way until 2013. My dad finally got upgraded to a still very shitty ~600 kbps DSL connection. He still can't stream anything effectively, but at least images load on web pages.
---
I read a shit ton of Wikipedia for fun through high school. Summers coming back from college to return to shiternet were also brutal.
---
I could've sworn they broke this healing addon in retail vanilla in the same patch they broke decursive's auto-target functionality. Maybe 1.8?
---
You'd think that, but I am terrible at PVP
---
Humans give a lil spirit, and you can also make good use of a paladin's threat reduction 
---
Warlock factions simplified:
---
Horde - easier pvp
---
Alliance - easier pve
---
Absolutely triggered... Thank You

Do you mind if I add a part of your post with a reference to the OP? It's hugely class specific but you made some good clarifications on the "why" part.
---
Thanks for the guide! A friend and I both used it and it worked perfectly! I saw this offer earlier but somehow I didn't think of just using it for battle.net balance.
---
Hell, Im happy with my 50/10 right now, I just don't use my connection enough for it to really matter, and the few ~~movies~~ open-source operating system images I download just take 30-45 minutes to do so.
---
Sure.

Hi, /u/888Kraken888

The average in America in 2007 was 3.67 Mbit

WF totem only gives 1 extra hit.
---
Any spec "works" for leveling a rogue but combat swords/maces is by far the best. 
---
Riposte is a cheat code against melee humanoids and nothing beats being able to take down 2 mobs at once every 2 minutes with blade flury.
---
Actually typically you do not use sunder armor that much in raids. It is generally up to the off warriors to sunder. You more often spend your rage on shieldbash, revenge and heroic strike. Adding in sunder armor only when you have enough rage and a free global cooldown.
---
how does it make sense from a community standpoint? if people want to get ahead of the rest, let them. if people wanna enjoy levelling more, let them. no reason to box in everybody to the same path
---
Heresy!
---
ClassicDB is the true successor!
---
I assume you mean because it's so awesome? :P I just happen to prefer darkshore/loch and those combined have more than enough quests to get you to 20
---
Yes really
---
hoping this will be the case and that a pick a popular server
---
This, also just straight herbalism or raid farming e'kos when raids are up.
---
You are totally right and I am confused why I said 3.
---
It can procc off of itself, but yeah.
---
Summer 2019 in Northern Hemisphere will begin on Friday 21 June and ends on Monday 23 September?
---
How are the game files handled?  Will you only be able to download the Classic game files, or will be include the BFA files? (I dont want to bloat my harddrive).
---
Will there be a different shortcut icon/.exe for the launcher for Classic vs BFA?
---
If not, how will the two games be handled at the login/character screen?
---
Sorry, I don't exactly understand your argument. I doubt Blizzard did anything as complicated as doing a combined calculation over all abilities, itemizations and possible raid compositions / class slottings to determine their boss healths, loot drop rates etc. It seems more probable that they went with a flat probability of class set drop rates over classes, and calculated the boss health based on a basic raid composition (3 Warrior Tanks, 8 Healers, rest DPS with an average DPS of X that they tested with some basic DPS specs like Combat Rogue and Frost Mage), maybe mixed in with some lore-influenced thinking and some influence from current meta vs meta shifts they wanted to cause.
---
I may well be terribly misunderstanding your position and would dearly like to hear a more in depth explanation of what you mean.
---
My opinion (at least in this thread :) ) is that it would be nice for a raid to even be possible of being DoT heavy. With the debuff limit in place that sort of raid composition is impossible. Even if your Affliction Warlocks were capable of pulling similar DPS to your Mages against a training dummy, you cannot fill in your caster slots in a raid with them since the debuff limit will cull their DPS output significantly. That is a sad thing indeed.
---
I made 60 last time before tbc but I had all the time in the world then 😂
---
Nah, no rush. I'm enjoying some TBC right now and just hit 70. I'd like to do some raids before classic...and BT isn't even out yet. Classic can take it's time, as long as it needs!
---
The numbers didn't really drop, but it was the first time that it really plateaued and they weren't seeing an increase in players
---
pserver that rhymes with 'ale'.
---
I did this for netherwing, do not recommend.
---
Shamans can tank early instances fairly okay, never heard about them accually tanking high lvl stuff.
---
Shift 1 bear, 2 cat, 3 travel, 4 is moonkin in retail aquatic in classic (if I even get it because fuck that quest)

Classic content will be too easy as it is. No need to make it even easier.
---
BFG Armada 2. It's fun darnit!
---
Only works in some 5 mans and it‘s not vaiable at all, not recommended, but if your are fully dedicated on it and can take the taunts of ppl, do it 😜
---
A early content slap a shield and go after 25-30 yeah not really
---
I can't remember, I don't recall anyone using it past BWL.
---
I know im tired, but i originally read that as youre '34, a mother, and married your brother' and was reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally confused.
---
Apparently my post was low effort TF mods????
---
Anyway, "*releasing spirit after dying while raid is still going on, missed loot?*".
---
I remember something like this.  Is this the case in Classic?
---
Even if they had 6000 HP (Very high number) it would only be 300 HP. And even then, I've heard it only calculates  off of Base HP, not HP after all your gear.
---
Spicy
---
We had a Shaman tank an add on Domo but that was about the extent of it. Worked out okay, too.
---
Yes, spectacularly. You don't even need to look very far back in Blizz's history.Even Ion has said BFA was released unfinished. They had entire classes that were gutted and not rebuilt until months after release. 
---
"Will release when it's done", what a joke.
---
I don't think they will be supporting add-ons like that in Classic.
---
It's a powerspike akin to shamans getting windfury at 30.
---
That’s why BFA is still in beta more than half a year post-release?
---
They're using the modern API so those kind of add ons won't work.
---
I killed Cthun recently on a private server and I just can’t comprehend how people did this back in 2005 with poor awareness and unplayable ms and fps.
---
Ehhh, not really a no-brainer. He topped meters every raid with the script and didn’t commit any of the mechanic missteps you hypothesize. Healer scripts are just OP in the vanilla API. Also for boss fights he didn’t auto follow. The times he used auto-follow were just to prove a point about how OP the scripts are.
---
To make the raids even easier so you casuals can get past lucifron? No, thanks, git gud.
---
Agree with the above, the OP build is flawed in many ways; building around setup was never really a good return for the points invested. Another issue is that without imp SS you will be kind of gimped until you get hemo, i.e. likely close to level 40. You will also struggle against situations with more than 2 mobs, or more than 1 where you can't sap - and without imp sap even picked in the build many sap situations will work out poorly anyway, including pvp.
---
In short, you're making leveling a lot harder on yourself here; I'd recommend just leveling as combat instead, and then respecing to hemo around level 40 if you absolutely want it. Combat is a good spec all the way to 60 really, and handles multi-mob situations very well.
---
Nice post!
---
Looks familiar..
---
Cause he’s not creepily stalking her, he’s attempting to actually flirt and court her. He’s probably never done it before though so he’s very out of his element.
---
The game was buggy as hell and horribly balanced. But damn was it a fun exploration through the star wars universe.
---
yeah, thats a great path. I loved Loch Modan as an alliance player. Same with WPL and EPL, some great quest lines up there.
---
Gaming was a 100% different medium back during classic. The internet was still was still young. V
---
Gaming wasn't main stream. Our culture was different. This social media culture always online has produced some seriously toxic kid gamers. The "Fortnite" generation. I understand your point completely but you also have to acknowledge that gamers and kid gamers were much different then than they are now.
---
Yeah, I googled some info on that and notice the same thing. It's weird to think about really, did Wrath not do enough to keep growing the player base or is it the fact that one you have nearly 12.5 million subscriptions, there isn't anyone else who isn't already playing. 
---
But even with burnout, the count went down drastically with each new expansions and that started with Cata, and it feels like Blizz lost their way and forgot about what makes a great game compared to trying to appeal to an even wider audience. Once you try to find a common ground beyond 12.5 million players, I think it's impossible to please everyone. Hell, it's remarkable that they could even appeal to 12.5 million in the first place.
---
Drop and Re-skill.
---
Because there's nothing new to discuss. 
---
Most of em are kinda bad yeah, but that's literally all memes always, that's part of the point.
---
Buy the premium version, it’s insanely cheap for how much everyone relies on it. If Wowhead were to disappear overnight I feel like a lot of people would be upset. 
---
Support your creators.

Yes I remember Apedog. I want to say Kalil was a big name in your guild. Ans Elu(or something with an E) the rogue?
---
Civ 5 and Empyrion: Galactic Survival
---
Awesome, thanks for the help :)
---
I think my main is going to be a male dwarf priest, but ill probably make a female paladin alt for kicks and giggles.
---
You joke but we are still waiting for high speed and are using our cell phone hot spot for internet. A download that size takes me a few hours 😫
---
I'd rather see memes than QQ threads (like this one.)
---
Quite a collection there. Praise the late 90s and early 2000s
---
P v E servers 4 lyfe!
---
Did play, but max i got was level 58 because i was only allowed to play 2 to 3 hours per day (parental controls were a bitch)
---
This guy gets it. If you're out grinding in say The Barrens, you have a stack of light leather which vendors for 3s and a grey item drops. That grey weapon likely vendors for at least as much as the leather. Since bag space is so limited its clear what you should do.
---
You'll maybe amass 10g from leather before 40 if you only kill beasts. Mid 50s when you get rugged leather regularly is when you start making money with skinning.
---
warlocks would become incredibly broken
---
Very good point!
---
Do you know if Classic will have the 2-second ticks?
---
Can you sell it?

Bloodborne
---
You can't see ghost from other factions.
---
I'm rolling Undead. I'm going to Hillsbrad to get ganked like every good walking pile of bones should.
---
Wrong, the versatility makes it one of the easiest healers to play. You have an option for any situation.
---
What is a gnome but a Dwarf for Dwarves?
---
Haha yep, i have a feeling it will be closer to the latter! I mean all those People that signed the petition for legacy servers, what was it like 280k? You gotta figure atleast half of those people will play probably more! Plus all the people who have since heard about it and are interested, and those that will try it from referral. I think the 500k you mention could be about right!

garrote doesnt silence in vanilla....?
---
The first time I did this download, I had dial-up internet. The download took over a week and I played wow from tbc until wrath at around one second behind everybody else. The things we do for love
---
Not only can Dwarves be rogues, but they have the absolute best pvp racial for rogues (and virtually everything else they can be).
---
Idk
---
You seem to misunderstand what I mean by "Skillcap". I mean skill ceiling for highest level of play. A hunter is super easy to play......but has the highest skill ceiling for pro play out of all the classes. Similarly, priest is very easy to play at a basic level (because they're so darn effective), but are the most complex to master.
---
I remember getting the Ravager on my pally during a run. All the other pallys in my guild treated it like a right of passage. They told me to go gather up a bunch of low level mobs, cast SoC and hope the procs line up. GLORIOUS!
---
The creator of Wowhead sold it to a company, that's why it's loaded with ads now. You're not supporting the creator.
---
LOL 48g from skinning at 40? This doesn't include buying spells, repairs, flights, etc. Passing up the gold you get from quests is not worth it. Realistically, you make 10g from skinning by 40 if you're diligently killing and skinning beasts between quests.
---
I used to love playing a rogue lvl 19 think, it was fairly easy to get the gear if I remember that’s if you have the gold and time to farm dungeons.
---
the weapons for melees are super expensive
---
Wasn't possible to change in vanilla.  This is an example of a change they might implement at some point though since it doesn't affect gameplay.
---
I played priest since 2005, its one of the easiest healer to play.  It has so many options to cover every situation.  Paladins have lots of buffs but really only spam FoL. Never played horde for shaman. Druids use one heal, for the most part, but several ranks (downranking, all healers downrank though, druid the most imo). Druid requires a good understanding of the timing of incoming damage to excel, imo.
---
Each have their own very different playstyle, and if you're interested in healing, you should try them all.
---
Not only does this all seem completely biased, most of it is wrong.  But that aside, \~\~PLAYER SKILL\~\~ trumps anything mentioned here. A player can play any class, do it well, and be successful. \~\~PEROID\~\~.
---
People should to play what they feel is fun, not what your biased based wrong facts point them towards.
---
I’ve had posts blocked for mentioning Private Servers, which I don’t really agree with, but I can respect that since they want to enforce some rules and organization. My only problem with it is that the only way we can have a current Vanilla experience is through using private servers, so I think it should be acceptable to be open and honest that a lot of people have tried them out, as long as we’re not actively pushing anything by name. We can have some lively discussion of “I experienced X on a private server - is this the same as Vanilla?” Etc. I don’t really get why this is a taboo since this is a social site that’s not owned or operated by Blizzard, so if they don’t like it then tough nuts. Are we afraid that blizzard will take some kind of recourse? I guess I just don’t really understand the rules.
---
I feel like you could twink any class you wanted to fairly easy if you had the time to run dungeons enough. The hard part would be BIS BOE's which would cost a fair amount of gold.
---
I can't really spot many things in this image that are "unnecessary".
---
never seen the need for a shammy tank, even in low level instances. No reason why they couldnt till level 30 as even warriors &amp; pally's are not wearing plate till after lvl 40.  But it'd get harder and harder to keep aggro.
---
Bfa? I am just saying what I've heard about Blizzards release plan.
---
Easiest imo were alliance 19 twinks, given the accessibility of deadmines. Far less chance of accidentally dinging 20 from discovering areas.
---
Get this filth out of here. WOW CLASSIC BEST GAME EVER!
---
Because it would give more players the chance to start MC at the same time. There's plenty of content at 60 that doesn't include MC/Ony.
---
I just think it would be nice to have players do dungeon content and then have a big opening of MC/Ony. Have some anticipation beforehand. 
---
Players can still get ahead with dungeon content. There's just an opportunity to make it impactful and meaningful with a grand release. 
---
It's just not going to be a good feeling knowing that t1/t2 loot is out there and every week I spend not powerleveling I'm missing out on the weekly lockout loot. It's not the same as missing out on repeatable dungeon loot
---
They said summer , summer doesn’t even begin for another 2 months. Y’all annoying
---
i had a level 19 frost mage and stacked all the + frost dmg green gear I could, I died in one hit but i crit with frostbolts for 600
---
One week of vacation wtf??? Damn!! I'm self employed so Ican take vacation whenever but I don't get paid lol xD but I'm willing to sacrifice a weeks wages for classic wow launch, I'll just have to starve for a week it's no problem! Lol
---
Simple. They're the master race.
---
Miss lotro.... Was a good game
---
Historically there was a lot of debate because we had no clue what the game was going to be. Changes vs no changes and delving into the finer points thereof made up most of the board.
---
Now we have some clear details from Blizz. We know 1.12, we know the content schedule, we know that (sadly) the 1.12 database is sacrosanct, we know spell batching is coming back in some form. There's no points to the arguments we were having months ago now that the answers are known.
---
And before you get too old-man-shakes-fist-at-sky, it's worth noting this board probably helped contribute to a few positive steps Blizz took in their announced plans, for example moving from 4 content phases to 6, including a content phase for dungeon itemization, and rolling back loot trading in 5mans. So it's not like everything has been for naught.
---
Now we're in a holding pattern. Maybe this forum will have worthwhile content once the game is live, or maybe this forum has run its course, who knows? But even if this forum dies, I still like to think it served a valuable function that helped to improve the quality of Classic we ultimately end up with, so that counts for something.
---
It's OK I made my roommate lose the game a few days ago, so it wasn't a long run this time around
---
Hmm interesting. I was seriously considering going back to a shadowpriest or rogue as I don't have the time for a Warrior, but maybe a druid might be just what the doctor ordered.
---
Think about old Blizzard, that takes literally decades between games. Where you wait like 12 years for the next one and when it comes out its so crazy polished and awesome and it blows you mind and you play it everyday for years.
---
They're trying to copy those guys, even tho they could've just gave us a realmlist to connect to.
---
Nostalrius client is a circle 
---
Blizzard current network is a triangle 
---
You cannot put a circle in a triangle slot
---
I'm not even American and I can safely say you're wrong.
---
You sir, are an idiot. Do you know how hard it is for most people to make a definitive choice on a race/class? People spend hours, days even, rerolling because they can't decide. I'm making it simple; presenting the generally most effective races/classes for most situations. Sure a good player can play anything....but if you mean to tell me that an equally skilled NE Priest and Dwarf Priest have an equally good time you really are as dumb as you sound.
---
I don’t know what all you hooligans are getting on about Battlegrounds. Back in my day, the only PvP we had was raiding Crossroads, and we liked it!
---
Voidwalker Sac is way too OP later for not dying to bad pulls, spawns, or other faction.  And mobs really start to hit harder as you level so taking even one or two hits as a standard geared clothie really shows.  Add in opportunist PvP and you’re gonna be dead a lot more.
---
A) I admit that it may be that overall DPS could increase, which would need changing if the increase was significant. (Although I think our raid DPS will already be significantly higher than 15 years ago.) In order for me to craft a proper counter argument I would need to properly analyze whether or not the DPS for top DPS specs would increase and if yes, then by how much. I definitely don't want to do that, just like no one at Blizzard would want to do that.
---
B) This is a false equivalence. Nothing guarantees that an Impale - Deep Wounds Warrior tank would be better TPS than eg. Fury Protection Warrior. (Fire Mages, by guarantee, be better since they already have a DoT (Ignite) that would no longer be pushed off from the debuff stack.) Still, it is a possibility which would again require at least a cursory analysis to disprove.
---
C) This is largely true, but at least some bad raiding specs would (or could) benefit from this. Hunters' Serpent Sting would become viable and would add some much needed DPS to a very sub-par raiding DPS class. Balance Druids' Moonfire might bring the spec from the level of "maybe not" to "maybe" in the raiding scene. Shadow Priests might rise from the level of "mandatory one" to "a couple, why not". Still, point A does indeed stand that the benefit that the strong DPS specs get might still keep the meta just as still as it is now, while just increasing overall raid DPS and screwing over any remnants of balance that there may be.
---
On the Affliction Warlocks: As I understand, isn't SM/Ruin more a Shadow Bolt spam build than a DoT build? The only DoT you actually use in it is Corruption to proc the instant Shadow Bolt, all others are ignored. Though, I admit this is something I don't really know much about and checking out the build seems to be a proper Affliction build through and through.
---
So the reasoning behind them not removing the 16 debuff limit is because it would make things almost too easy. Back in 2004-2006 or how ever long the 8 debuff limit stayed in for the raid bosses and every other high value mob was scaled to 8 debuffs. 
---
If you changed that 8 debuffs to say 100 debuffs, you now have 20 dot up there + all of your debuffs, and everyone stacking everything so DPS of a raid goes up, raid / boss difficulty goes way down. 
---
If you think they could off set that by scaling boss health to the new average amount of DPS thats the wrong way to think of things. We want out Authentic vanilla experience and adding on Dev time because some people think that removing the debuff limit would be better for the game is ridiculous. 
---
This also kind of falls under class balancing since it would make more specs viable in end game content.
---
Really? I thought Warlocks were closer to the middle of the DPS curve?
---
It's bit ineffective in early days but doable. Better would be rogue+feral or double rogue, quick cap and return to stealing towers
---
I'm duo leveling warrior shammy with my wife. Pretty sure both of us plan to have hunter alts for when one of us isn't able to or isn't up for playing and will help us funnel resources to the guild.
---
I recently ran sm lib on a pserver like 9 times, saw it drop once and the shittiest druid I've ever played with out rolled me. Felt bad. Hope it drops the next time around..
---
That wasted far more time than actually killing the trash. Wow lol.
---
Is that truly the case? What would lead to gimping the content? Is there so much DPS being lost on DoTs being pushed out, or am I missing something else here?
---
This. Save yourself the pain and level as combat, it's really superior for almost everything at that range. Respec sub when you can get hemo if you really want it, but it'll make you less effective.
---
On a side note, I guess this has been discussed to death before I got here, but do we have any information regarding what does happen after naxx? I can only see 3 options:
---
 1. they do nothing and people just slowly progress at their own pace making it further than they could in vanilla with TBC released so quickly after naxx. This has the downside of people just running out of content and quitting
---
2. They release new servers, or have ones predetermined that start from scratch every so often so people can start all over again. This is my preferred option, I can start out with a new class and see how far I can casually make it in the next cycle 
---
3. They release new content, either in the form of TBC or new raids/dungeons. This one would really piss off a lot of the no changes people, but could be extremely interesting.
---
Interesting theory that is refuted by the evidence.
---
Subs dived dramatically when they reduced the impact of dying and made it easier to get into raids.
---
I really wish we could go back to not using the launcher. I would like my account to not be tied to battle.net so my friends list is server only.
---
...But the unspecified release date draws one day closer.
---
Stay positive comrade.
---
I don't really understand the analogy - as far as I know (with some flaws), a handful of guys were essentially able to recreate and host vanilla WoW once again.
---
I get that Blizzard's server infrastructure might not accommodate things, but what's wrong with just giving us a client to download with a realmlist file already included? If a handful of plebs managed, why can't a huge corporation?
---
&lt;Four Horsemen and Bob&gt; not sure if we used 4 or Four, but that was it, me and 4 work buddies decided to make it, got all the signatures, booted out the others once the guild was made.  We were 4 undead, all named Death, Pestilence, War, Famine.   We used symbols in the names as the original was taken.  So like Wār and such.  Then we had our 5th friend, whose name was Bob, and we'd all ride up on our undead mounts looking epic, and beside us was Bob, no mount, and ratty grey gear.   We had so much fun with that guild but eventually we logged in one day to find that our character names and guild names had to be changed due to using "historical figures" or something like that.  Bob was the only one that was able to keep his name.

That's fair, thanks for clarifying.

Legal stuff also they want to use blizzard network

---
Gatta market them cute Nelf Hunter girls to get people to roll Alliance!
---
Still remember Ion tanking the last 10% of a sloppy raid kill, was one of the three BWL drakes. Was in a discussion way back about using vs not using cloth, leather vs mail and non shield off hands. 
---
Personally tanked all non raid vanilla content on my Shaman at some point. Not because I wanted to or thought it was good, tanks were just rare. It is all doable but quite a bit harder.
---
Oh this takes me back
---
Its really not tough to farm as a level 60, it just depends on what you want to farm. If you have a gathering profession, just head out and gather and sell the mats. I never liked this too much myself, and preferred doing lower level instances to cash as I had enchanting as a profession.  Doing Scarlet M runs, and DEing all the drops, and cloth + vendor crap, makes pretty good gold at 60.  The Scarlet mail armor (5 pcs are BOE), sell well on the AH. 
---
If you have tailoring, bags are a great way to make cash, and the magewave bags are not soulbound, so folk can send them to alts. 
---
You could easily do SM a couple times as a level 60 Shammy, in an hour or so. Chain pull and AOE down the mobs. Happy looting.
---
I know. I'm playing a bit of retail to kill time, and I vendored some purples by level 30. Different game.
---
this is just downloading the installer, it's a temporary file
---
Very few classes have fear/charm.  Warlock has both, warriors have a long cooldown fear, priests have an also relatively long cooldown fear.
---
Everyone and their mum has some kind of stun.  Is there even a class in the game that doesn't have some kind of stun?  Sure some are better than others and some might require a certain spec but I can't think of any class right now that doesn't have the ability to get some sort of stun.
---
Then there are also classes that rely on stun to do more damage to you.  Rogues, Paladins, Druids - there may be more, all do more damage to stunned targets either directly or indirectly (being able to use backstab vs someone who's stunned rather than it being unreliable vs someone who isn't).
---
Also lets not forget hardiness isn't even an active ability, it's always there.
---
still got to do the STV gear grind whatever class you pick

---
Well you aren't allowed to discuss your opinions in this sub. If you do you get banned. So that's why it devolves into memes.
---
The 1.12 client that Nost and all the other pservers use is old. It has security flaws in it and has a lot of other issues with it. When blizzard releases a game they want it perfect (in their eyes), so to release a client that would have open security flaws that thay are aware of would be a mistake on their part. 
---
In order to fix those security flaws they would have to update the client with all of the same things or most of the sam things they've already done on [battle.net](https://battle.net), so it would be a long dev process and would be like releasing a brand new game. 
---
The easiest way for them to release a safe and up to standard client and game is to re-engineer the game on their newest client. 
---
We are not actually waiting on [battle.net](https://battle.net) integration anymore. Thats been done. We found that out in the demo. Sure theres a few things that they needed to fix with it and fine tune it, but I'm sure that was done by the end of december. What we're waiting on now is the polishing of the game, probably still assets within game being changed like lighting and graphics, and possible bugs within quests and mob mechanics. 
---
Blizzard during blizzcon gave us a quick overview of what they are doing to make this an authentic experience for us. Example being changing how lighting is coded into the game and changing a lamp posts light source because it was a slightly different shade or made a slightly different shadow. Going through the entire game to make sure all of these are as close as possible is why this process is taking so long. There are millions of assets in wow probably and to ensure they all look correct is a tedious process.
---
Ad hominem tells me you have no intelligible argument, thanks.
---
I can and I will tell you, that while i played a NE priest alongside a dwarf and human priest, it was fucking awesome. We killed 11/15 naxx in 2006.  So tell me again how I didn't have fun!
---
Regardless of whether you can or not, it's almost 100% not worth it.

Even if an owl is as good as some people claim (which is pretty debatable in it's own right), you're wasting hours of game time that you could have spent leveling up with a cat, boar, or any other semi-decent pet. Not to mention all the time you need to waste getting the next few ranks of screech, which are in pretty inconvenient locations.
---
It's worth considering if you are going an alliance hunter, but as horde it's just too much investment for a pet that is *maybe* as good or slightly better than a cat.
---
Look around and read stuff here. Especially the Dev Watercoolers.

---
So the wait *is* because they're gunning for Battlenet integration? ;p
---
Well, you can always come back at a later level when not everything on the way there will aggro and kill you from miles away.
---
This is not the case at the highest echelon of the tryhard community.  Those furies don't want to tank because they like seeing big numbers in zerker stance, not because they can't. zug zug.  Personally I don't feel a hybrid druid is ever optimal and thus would never prioritize their spot in a raid, but based on what you've described I can see why it may appear in a more casual raid environment.
---
Does the friends list really say 10 years for people? lol
---
watch the blizzcon classic talk.
---
Good advice :)
---
Blizzard has to actually support the product. So they can reuse all the old stuff, but now they have all those old exploits and bugs they have to fix...and we're not talking just in-game bugs and exploits like wall climbing, we're talking a macro that can crash the server.
---
But they also have to provide customer service. Their current system allows all their reps to support multiple games. But the old client doesn't work on their current system, so they have to adapt it anyway.
---
It's cheaper, easier, and more feasible for them to do it this way. If they did it the other way around (just use all the old stuff and rework all the dangerous, server halting stuff, create a new customer service route for *just* vanilla) they'd have to spend much more money, and that would mean they be unwilling to proceed due to perceived risk and other factors.
---
Even more shitty are the respawns....
---
Even if the meta isn't being followed, already game mechanics knowledge and player skill has likely improved so much that the balance is far gone. Also, if the meta affecting the game is a non-issue since it isn't forced on you personally, then isn't debuff limit removal similarly a non-issue? If you want to, you can play the game with a self-imposed debuff limit of 8 and eg. avoid using Rend on bosses because in true Vanilla it would've been forbidden for pushing debuffs off the boss.
---
I know that argument is a bit sarcastic, but if (and by this point I admit it is a big IF) removing the debuff limit would open up the game for more of the "invalid" spec choices, wouldn't that be a good thing, even if it did improve those specs DPS output?
---
Oh my god how much I loved this downloader !! :OO
---
Come classic I'd like to think that the Gys will be neutral as they were always intended to be, at least to my recollection. There are issues on private servers with Gy spawns being incorrect at times or bringing you to a further GY than it should. My guess is yes you would be able to , but it may be difficult. Also depends on server type as well- pve would be much easier for sure just have to avoid guards
---
Different game, different files. IDK how big it will be, probalby bigger than current 1.12 Clients. But it will be separated in the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher just like wc3 reforged or the other games.
---
If a bug occurs on a private server, it is not a big deal. If too many occur on blizzard's live servers, shitstorm will be incoming.
---
I also think a huge amount of work was caused by merging the old game with blizzard's modern "ecosystem". Also private servers had no complete droprates and loot tables, which had to be recreates by Blizzard.
---
The Instance and WoWInsider links does not work on my end.
---
That is a good question. Personally, I hope that once the true Classic content phases are done, we'll get new Classic content that f.ex. was planned but never released. Sort of a "what if World of Warcraft didn't go the route of level cap increases" alternative universe :)
---
Pserver and Monster Hunter World
---
Don’t worry, as soon as we have more updates or the actual game to play there will be discussion again. There’s just not much to talk about, if, like most of us probably, you’ve been riding the hype train since Classic was announced and hanging around the subreddit. :)
---
My last final is today, its summer.
---
I browse R/deadbydaylight quite a lot, a subreddit way more riddled with memes than this one. And I personally think memes keep a subreddit alive and fresh and fun to visit. There will always be productive conversations that would have happened anyways with or without the memes anyways.
---
If the board fluctuates between topic conversations during announcements or release, and memes during periods of downtime, id call that a healthy, successful subreddit.
---
I’ve seen where snobby memeless video game subreddits go and they’re always the worst. Very small, very dull, dead, and an unfunny subreddit is usually indicative of a dying game. 
---
I’ve also seen the opposite where it’s 99% memes (I’m on r/deadbydaylight a lot) and they can be amazing too. With plenty of important discussions. Believe it or not humor can be separate but exist simultaneously
---
Can't say anything on that unfortunately - never played on a PvE server myself.
---
Blizzard has a completely working version of the 1.12 client.
---
However blizzard wants proper quality of the game and implement things like battlenet into the game. They decided that it was a lot easier to take retail and then backscale it to classic, rather than trying to work with a 14 year old broken client. Another reason is that it's easy to see the mistakes with the backscale because it's visual, where as the issues with making the 1.12 client work would be hidden behind code. 
---
I suggest you give this video a look, it's pretty interesting and explains a lot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
Thank you, though I can't say I agree with going through and fixing old visual mistakes (classic means classic!), I can at least see where they're coming from. You explained it very nicely :)
---
Levels 35-40 alone farming in swamp of sorrows you make 25g a level just vendoring everything (including skins). I don't think you know what you are talking about :)
---
Thanks for the link!
---
[12 minutes in so far, it's what prompted the question :p](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM)
---
The Classic items are already viewable on Classic WoWhead though, just like the have a different site for the PTR and Retail, they have one for Classic (and the Classic site has old comments from Thottbot and Allakhazam on the item pages). Different websites for different servers.
---
Tell me some more about how you 2/3 through Naxx without any dwarf priests......oh wait, you did have some....because you HAVE TO HAVE SOME. Your guild would've been better served if you'd have picked a Dwarf. You were being carried by the smart guys that did pick one. And as for waving Naxx in my face....I've cleared Naxx too, on multiple servers, with multiple classes. It's not that big of an accomplishment anymore.
---
Fornite kids arent going to play wow classic.
---
I think it's something on your end. Listening to an old The Instance right now.
---
Delay it then. More time for me to farm 10 months of token time.
---
Thanks! Watching it right now.
---
KOTOR2? O dang
---
I want a proper TBC just like I want a proper vanilla.
---
It’s not the dying and long runs that bug me, it’s the literal impossibility of getting into that portal now that ships Rez you while crossing over zones.
---
Guess I’ll just have to wait and see. Fingers crossed for neutral graves though.
---
Dirt Rally 2, Max Payne 1&amp;2, and pserver
---
Pets are pets pretty until level 20+. Get a hillsbrad cat and you’ll be good until you get a rare pet
---
Also it’s gonna run on current wow client not the old one
---
GET OFF MY LAWN!
---
Every server I played on had more than a few of these guys/gals.
---
These types of folks really add a lot of the heart to the server community.
---
The love helping people just to help, and go out of their way to do it. Chasing people down just to buff them is a great example.
---
shareholders tend to frown on such antics
---
Have leveled many a rogue. Its just too powerful if youre looking for the quickest way. Other classes have much more closely-matched trees however for leveling. *Cough* arms/fury
---
Wait, stoneclaw totems interrupted stealth?
---
Tell me, what fights absolutely require a dwarf priest?
---
They announced new servers -- not months in advance or anything, but they didn't just pop up anonymously.
---
Other than that, as has been brought up many times, one of their main reasons for even launching classic has been to regain control of the vanilla experience from the private servers. They'll want to have a measurable impact in that regard and not just sneak something online. And then there are many other reasons.
---
Comparing console gamers to PC gamers... That's a major mistake buddy. We're two completely different breeds. 
---
" everything in their time was better without actually taking time to take things in perspective " 
---
There's zero questions athat wow was much better back during vanilla then it is today. There's even factual evidence... # of subscribers. 
---
" Id rather have a kid in my guild than old man saying that the beatles are better than todays music. "
---
Okay Michael Jackson... don't be too ignorant here. Let me guess, your guild name is "Adventure Land" ? Trying to attract all those little kiddies. Have fun my friend.
---
I agree. I couldn't care less if the lamp post in elywnn was giving off light in the incorrect manner. 
---
What I do care about is the pride they have behind classic and the length they are going to, to ensure that we have the classic experience that we did back in 2004-2006. That is why my faith in blizzards classic team is so high. Like I said, I couldn't care less about the lighting effects of exact graphics, but to know they are going to those lengths to fix things, means a lot to me.
---
Your GF is a waste of time ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
There are 2 main reasons:
---
1. Blizzard would never release a private server as their own. Mostly moral, ethics and legal issues. At the same time, they also have their own working 1.12.1 client so why bother? They could just release their own client from 2006/2007, right?
---
2. Wrong! Battle net integration is one hurdle, but also security. Much has changed the last decade in internet security and such. They would have to pump a lot of time and money into the client to make it secure and work with todays technology.
---
Therefore they went with the easier and cheaper option: 7.3.5 client (battlenet and secure) with 1.12.1 database and models.
---
I played religiously, and very anti socially, starting early 2005. Rogue and alts until 2006 or so, then a shadow priest when I got big into pvp. That was when I started exploring more content
---
Since you are playing feral and were talking about min-maxing to the point of faction choice, naturally, you are in a serious guild that knows their stuff. Thus the shaman is not an idiot and is geared and min-maxing correctly.
---
R1 comment:DD
---
I can dig it
---
I have been told, there is nothing left to discuss. What is this? Magic?
---
Great out of the box thinking and in theory this should work, but I suspect that in practise this will take extreme concentration to make it worthwhile. If it means that say, you lose one auto shot a minute or so because of the difficulty of the rotation then it's probably not worth doing.  It is certainly worth investigating though. Another thing I have considered that probably is really unconventional is using Spell power gear before big AOE pulls + volley and obviously couple this with engineering explosives which folk are already doing. Then FD/switch gear once the volley AOE is done casting. Not sure how much of a gain this will be in practise though.
---
Even with uOrigin and adblockers, if a website is stuffed with scripts and ads it's going to run like shit.
---
Top off Org bank buffing was always fun
---
I'd be happier if a ret got it for the memes rather than a rogue.
---
Didnt remember. Thanks.
---
Even if for some reason they wanted to use the nost core (they don't lol) they couldn't legally use anyway. It's based off mangos which has been developed by dozens of contributers over the years, and they don't own any of that code. Not to mention the quality is not even close to Blizzard standards, and they'd never be able to integrate it into battle.net, etc.
---
I have a lot of respect for all the devs that have contributed to the private server scene over the years, but those stock cores are a complete mess of spaghetti code all duct-taped together into the rough shape of vanilla wow. Blizzard wouldn't touch that with a 10 foot pole.
---
Hundreds of people have already done so.
---
Ooo, that's an interesting debuff I had no idea about! If things like this crop up more, then definitely removing the debuff limit would cause big problems. At present, this seems like quite a negligible increase, though I may again be very wrong.
---
Although, of course buff / debuff overriding should still be a thing. Only one of Gift of Arthas debuff, only one Curse of Elements etc.
---
I hear you but it’s not like I’m going for world first,  I’m going to try and enjoy the play through.  Not just mindlessly zerg my way to 60.  Plus I like owls and want to liberate one from the Nelfs.
---
Owls were an amazing tanking pet, in vanilla, but tough to get as horde. Think it was only around level 40 you could get one.
---
And betray “all your friends” for a girl.. 
---
unless all means 0.
---
I played on Norgannon also! Was in Blood and Thunder and a pvp guild called Pwners Den. Good times had back then!
---
Sounds like your GF is smarter than you. As someone who will most likely be forced to go Alliance to play with my IRL friends and our larger friend group , fuck the Alliance.
---
The Horde scream, "For the Horde!" and the Alliance's warcry in return is, "Have mercy!"
---
Lok'tar O'gar, red is dead.
---
Yep - you're dead on the money here. This is one of the many small important pieces that make up vanilla as a whole. It got shaved off as a quality of life change somewhere along the road, which eventually led to the hollow state it became some time after WotLK (imo).
---
Another key aspect for me is working really hard for loot and *not getting it all*. This makes the pieces you do get feel so much more rewarding, and it keeps the game interesting for much longer.
---
&gt; Orc 4 life!
---
&gt; Mage flair
---
Yeah would require a priest with fade. Anyone else would be destroyed quickly
---
Probably a lot of people at the time as having a second HDD for low end PC's was a luxury. When I first played classic my C:\\ drive was 40GB, and then later I got a 160GB drive that I used for games/music.
---
My mage on live is Orc.
---
Classic will hopefully last for YEARS before they get ideas about TBC. 
---
TBC was great.  That was the peak IMO.  Wrath is where it went downhill.
---
I was thinking either Tauren or Troll shaman! And Orc warrior as a tank. I might be playing with a friend, but our work life schedules are way different.
---
Let's just ignore buffs like blessings of kings then.
---
go horde, she is right
---
Kevin Jordan, one of the class designers, said easily up to ST.  Its also been proven to work in all 5mans.
---
Okay, yes, you can completely unlearn the profession, I'd have thought that was obvious. *Changing* your specialization rather than completely unlearning the whole profession was introduced in TBC.
---
[I made a thread about skinning a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a1vrt6/on_skinning_for_gold_while_leveling/) and I found that you're likely to get 50-60g by time you hit 60. You're looking at only 10-20g by time you hit 40. This is based on my fairly standard hunter skinning everything, running each dungeon once or twice, mostly questing (following Joana's), and with about 8 days /played to 60. About as standard of a leveling experience as you could get.
---
Skinning will help you with your mount, but it's not even getting you 1/4 of the way there, and not including gold expenses like talents, FPs, food/water, repair bills, etc. You're better off hitting that mount cost by grinding efficiently for gold when you start getting close, AH'ing everything you can, not upgrading all skills, not doing professions, upgrading bags asap, etc.
---
Yo send me a collectors box with a USB install. The USB could be shaped like Quel'Serrar or something.
---
VERMINTIDE 2
---
I'll check it out! I just like the look and feel of shamans. Not really a skilled player, haha.
---
In classic playing on a PvE server takes out such a huge part of the impetus to get stronger.  When some guy comes and ganks you, you feel bad and want to get stronger and better so you can kill that guy next time.  You have to play differently, stay at high health when in contested territory, and just enjoy the experience of PvPing.  Sometimes it really sucks, sometimes it's a lot of fun, but without it there the game feels hallow and empty.  On a PvP realm a lot of people started raiding MC in the first place to get stronger so they would be stronger out in the world.  Raiding for the sake of raiding came later for a lot of us.
---
Fury Warrior tanking isn't "optimal" either, but are you really going to kick your Fury Warriors out of the raid for a Protection Warrior every time you need a tank who wears a shield? Of course not. You deal with the slightly less optimal build because it's not practical to "optimize" everything 100% of the time.
---
We're actually in a very happy relationship, and I'm just as excited as he is for the release. It makes him happy, it makes me happy. I didn't get to experience classic, only retail, so it's good to have all this info. Might want to take some of that advice yourself though! Might give you something to do other than shit on other people's happiness! Hope you have a good one!
---
Really like warrior (main since vanilla, with breaks) but everyone and their mother are playing warrior. Additionally I am working 50hours+ so I‘m thinking about a warlock because pugging will be easier. Any advice what to play?
---
Lok'tar!
---
Will you guys be rolling on a West coast server? (Assuming so since pst)
---
Between the sub fee, having a shit PC, and shit internet i didnt play vanilla.  Hell, i didnt start until Wrath and i think i still only had 128k (maaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe 256) DSL at the time.
---
Even then i had to make sure to start a big patch in the morning if i could.
---
I remember getting 1.5meg at some point (cata?) and it felt like the fastest thing ever.
---
Im on 50 now at home and feel so damn spoiled.
---
I have uBlock Origin and it runs great actually.

They should just add the debuff limit to BFA

 [https://deathraygames.com/articles/walkthroughs/wow-horde-owl/](https://deathraygames.com/articles/walkthroughs/wow-horde-owl/) 
---
I don't know how accurate this is, but google told me, he got an Owl as an Orc, so it must be true!
---
Confirmed works.
---
Yeah more than likely. Our main concern is staying away from big streamer servers. So if there are zero PST servers left by the time we avoid all of them, then we'll probably roll CST or EST. First choice is definitely PST though.
---
Yet, the game will not be the same as Vanilla and that is a fact. There will be changes. A 100% #nochanges position is so inflexible that it has already broken. I guess I'm more of a #80%nochanges guy :)
---
I played alliance on the server Laughing Skull. Why is that important? Because the famous Leeroy and his guild &lt;Pals for Life&gt; had their home on my server.
---
I started in 2006 but only leveled to 43 :(
---
Good old BFA, released only when it was developed to perfection.
---
"ok" https://www.statista.com/statistics/616210/average-internet-connection-speed-in-the-us/
---
I'd dump her, no way I am turning on the Alliance.
---
TBC is where it began to go downhill. People will want TBClassic, but what I want is more content in the Vanilla style after Naxx is done. This means no flying, no content that makes Vanilla obsolete, and everything contained in one world.
---
However, if we had to steal one thing from TBC, we should steal the talent trees. I think we can all agree that the actual implementation of the classes is mediocre at best.
---
I was listening to Joana talk about it, and he was saying he had to refresh the server list several times a day in order to get onto a fresh server because they didn't say when they would be put up. 
---
I never tried starting fresh during vanilla so I don't know personally, just what Joana said.
---
Look at OP, bragging about having 20+ FPS.
---
We get it, you’re rich.
---
What game is called BFA? My brain is fried in the heat.
---
For RP is there gear we can get that is ok to heal 5s that is plate or as close without looking like a clunky priest wearing a dress? I’ll even do blacksmith if I have to
---
Ya I’ve seen it but that before graveyards changed.  Guide didn’t work anymore.  You can only get as far as Teld.
---
I would say that there is generally an over-emphasis on frost mages in pvp. There are so many counters to the control from frost in group pvp, especially on higher levels when people are carrying faps with them that the pure nuke from fire becomes pretty worthwhile. The only ones that can compete with fire burst-wise are elemental shamans. 
---
With that said frost mages are obviously better when it comes to flag carrying which is pretty important for playing a mage in WSG.
---
the more binds you can manage the better off you'll be but realistically there is no reason you can't be a competent pve'er with less than 30 which should be very attainable for most people

I had the old 5 disc pack, I was so glad when they sent the 1 DVD trial to game stores.  I used to have to uninstall and reinstall a lot.
---
You don't *need* to bind everything. Only abilities you'll actively be using in combat. My create healthstone is going to be on one of my side action bars, but it isn't going to have an actual keybind.
---
Fury tanking is very optimal! Warrior stacking in general is optimal. It is bis, in fact. All MC, Ony, and BWL speedrun records are done with fury stacking, AQ40 and Naxx only marginally less so but still 25+% of the raid is warriors.
---
Trash dies faster if you have more DPS, so you still don't need to drink if you don't want to. But trust me, your healers are drinking even when you stack them. The meta for "Resto" Druids on private servers is to spec for Imp Regrowth + Nature's Grace and spam Regrowth - probably the most inefficient heal in the game - on those fights to snipe other healers. They drink a LOT. Then they use efficient heals on longer fights like Hakkar.
---
That build (24/0/27 usually) has the same healing potential as a 0/30/21 tank/hybrid build on any fight that doesn't lend itself to Regrowth spam.
---
Cucked

I did it back in the day, but I don’t remember if it was Vanilla or TBC. Problem was, I was brand new to playing a hunter and didn’t realize I had to feed my pet to keep it around. Went through all the travel and corpse hopping, tamed it, hearthed back to Razor Hill and went afk. I came back and my owl had run away. I was so annoyed that I deleted the character.
---
Thanks everyone for your answers! Aiming for rank 7-10 seems reasonable :) See you in Classic!
---
I typically do
---
* 12345
---
* qertfg
---
* space, m4, m5, middle mouse
---
then shift + all those same ones, and shift+mouseup/mouse down
---
That gives me about 32, I guess, so maybe I'll be alright
---
Imagine they actually released new classic content after the ‘final patch’ of vanilla. That’s what I’m hoping for after a couple of years then straight into classic tbc
---
I'm already planning Onyxia vs 40 Druids. This is my goal.
---
My friends and I have decided to focus on PVP for wow classic. I would still like to experience PVE since I never hit 60 in vanilla. I've decided to go with a dwarf shadow priest for PVP because that is what my first toon was, but I was wondering if there is any chance I would be any kind of asset in PVE. Should I alter my talents to accommodate for my situation?
---
Mage is top tier for both PvP and PvE.  You'll be fine.
---
Then why do you need to do it at level 10 if you aren't rushing, just wait till you can get one later.
---

It is a game, not a museum. A game for paying customers, at that. At the end of the day it is not about preservation, it is about Blizzard bowing their heads to fans asking again and again. Sure, preserving is a part of it but I'll be surprised if Blizzard just leaves Classic WoW alone to stay as it is when it releases after they've spent so much resources to bring it to being in the first place. Or maybe they will... Anyway, I'm quite sure Blizzard will be listening to how "bad" or "good" people think Classic is once it releases, and will adjust accordingly (without throwing out the baby with the bath water, of course). They do want their money back in the end, to hell with preserving the game in a museum glass cabinet.

Sometimes you pull the lever and win the jackpot. When you do the dopamine rush you got makes you chase the next jackpot over and over.

I played on a PVE server in vanilla as Alliance warlock and now I'm going to play on a PVP server as an undead horde warlock. I have the same concerns about getting camped trying to level, but I think in the long run it will add to the experience of playing wow. I now have to think about where I'm going and if I need to go as a team. I need to learn pvp strategies and skills. I'm respeccing to soul link at 45 because of pvp concerns. I think it will be worth it in the long run. Classic is our chance to play the game a new way.
---
Both are good enough. UD's WotF is handy for certain bosses' mechanics. Racial priest spells are shadow-based for either UD or troll and have their niche of strength regardless of race. 
---
You mostly sacrifice a casting speed cd racial, but get a safety cd.
---
I had 10Mbps in the US at the time and even 2Mbps in a third world country with crap infrastructure.
---
You're very rude :(
---
Ouch
---
yeah, that's typically what I do, like for res, food/drink, hearth, etc...
---
That's pretty much the gist behind it, I have the formulas but it's mostly the more used soft caps that matter for the spell pen that I am not 100% sure about. I'll try to find a list of everything we can dig through, if people can post the resistance and spell penetration stuff here it would be amazing, I'll try to compile some basic stuff together.
---
OP's work is impressive, but for example I have a crazy memory fort this kind of things and consider myself as prepared as OP without any kind of notes. Still doesn't take the fun away, it's the opposite, U can look forward to everything I'm going to be doing.

yea well, like all vanilla videos , hes bad and his opponents are worse. Like, why is this hunter running TOWARDS him instead of away from? its infuriating
---
There was a long while where it was mathematically impossible to kill as well, Funnily enough it was Ion hazzikostas that got into an argument with blizzard and pointed it out to them when he was a hardcore raide.
---
Personally I hope they draft some new ones. It creates confusion to say I play on so and so server (classic) or (retail).
---
you'll be fine, i'd be surprised if you couldnt at least use shift with half of those, then just put your out of combat but still frequently pressed stuff on your 2nd (shift 2) action bar and scroll to it out of combat
---
also, with shaman you really aren't going to need to down rank much offensively besides earth shock, either class should be very playable for you

Sam Didier would include pandas on his Christmas cards to family and blizzard employees. His first one is somewhere between Wc2 release and wc3 release. 
---
Given that arthas wasn’t a released known figure until wc3 was released, and pandas would have been in the semi public eye prior they come from at least the same era if not before.
---
I dunno I’ve never understood the hatred for pandaria. It’s panda themed content for the 10 hours while leveling and the first raid tier. Nothing in tot referenced pandas, nor in soo. 
---
I’ll take a million panda/cuddles/blah blah expansions is my alternative is wod, legion, or bfa. Like the story or not in bfa, at least the content, PvP, heroic raids, challenge modes, proving grounds was good and except for releasing tot too soon (which helps lead to the year long soo), was paced well.

You basically just ask “what should I play” in several of those posts. There’s a weekly thread for that. Which is where those posts should go. Hence their removal. 
---
You also have a lot of insanely basic questions in your post history. E.g. “where do I go to see what gear looks like.” In many cases that question dropped verbatim into a search engine would yield a decent result. It looks like those haven’t been removed that often, but they also don’t seem to garner many upvotes.
---
I see a decent number of questions in your history that ask specific questions about the Classic client implementation. Those aren’t super popular since, as you should know, we don’t have a final answer here. People can tell you what the demo was like, but none of us have our hands on the final game. So asking specifics about animation, etc, doesn’t make much sense. Hence to low to no upvote count on those, but again they haven’t been removed. Despite them being kinda pointless. 
---
In at least one post I see you asking for a referral to a private realm. That isn’t allowed, which is clearly stated in the rules. Guessing that was removed. 
---
So. Yeah. If you ignore the rules you’ll have posts removed. Shocking.
---
Yes, fury tanking is optimal.  Warrior stacking in general is optimal!  They represent over 25% of the raid at every raid tier.

the numbers don't lie son.
---
Windfury proc RNG with Arcanite Reaper lolamirite
---
Exactly - Der Herr der Ringe
---
Off the top of my head: Magmadar (MC), Onyxia, Nefarian (BWL), Bug Trio (AQ), Gluth (Naxx). There's also plenty of trash packs (specifically in AQ and Naxx) that it really helps to have. 
---
And don't you dare give me that load of horseshit that Warriors can stance dance it because 1) The cooldown leaves a timing window where they can't. And 2) You're doing your raid a huge disservice by putting all that pressure on the tank to get it right every time anyway.
---
Second this. I would love you forever that looks amazing love the effort
---
We can be grumpy together!
---
But on topic, I find some of the memes funny, but I very much enjoy the in depth threads/discussions. 
---
I love learning things I never knew about original WoW, and I love hearing other peoples stories about their experiences in vanilla.
---
Because I was hoping to to have it with me from the time I could tame one, to endgame.  Level 40 is a long time to wait.
---
&gt; you not choose who to buy the token from? Is it just a "buy a token" button and whoever is next in the queue sells it for a fixed price?
---
Yes, that's how it works. Also the price is controlled by an algorithm based on supply and demand, no players can decide how much to buy or sell a token for.
---
&gt; anything seen as remotely against the "spirit of classic" would poison the well
---
Oh I absolutely agree. There's so much distrust that people usually put out their pitchforks even before knowing how something will actually work. It's understandable since Blizzard doesn't exactly have a clean record of doing things right and/or keeping their word, but still.
---
As for those trades, I believe they will be much less common than people think and won't have a meaningful impact on Classic.
---
That's because you first need people playing Classic that are also good at farming to have enough gold to give away for trades. Farming in Classic is a lot harder than farming retail, not only because of more difficult mobs but also no flying.
---
Then you need people playing retail that *also want to play Classic* otherwise they'd have no reason to trade their gold from retail to Classic.
---
People who want to pay their sub with gold will soon find out it's a lot easier to farm retail for it, even if you don't like retail.
---
People who just want to buy gold will do from gold sellers like it's happening in 15 years (the token doesn't stop gold selling) but hopefully get promptly banned.
---
&gt; classicgold-for-retailgold being against the ToS for that reason
---
The TOS doesn't currently forbid this. They would have to change it to forbid cross-game trades, but even if they did it would be debatable because Classic and retail are technically the same game.
---
sure, it can works with perfect gear and every buff in the game. However, is it wanted or even half as effective than a war? no
---
And a widescreen monitor.
---
Upvote for Lincoln park reference :)
---
Started early 2005, and had three 60s at the end of vanilla.  Started with a human Paladin with a mage alt, in 2006 switched to a horde rogue and have mained him ever since!
---
Still got the old book sized manual? I love to read it from time to time. It wasn't even accurate on launch but reading it with retail in mind is just hilarious. And the old box art brings back memories.
---
T10 had one—maybe two good fights (hLK, sindragosa), the majority of heroic icc was a snooze fest, underfunded or had easy mechanics, and limited attempts were the only thing stalling progress.
---
yeah, thats a good point. Vanilla wow was amazing. I may roll my 2nd character on a PVP server once I've gotten my main to 60 on the PVE. Play it when I get bored, and want the thrill... :D
---
Must not bite...
---
I mean, that was just one example, there are literally thousands of things like this in the game so many that would be completely destroy any gameplay outside of just finding more garbage to throw on the boss. Removing debuffs limits is just an outright wrong design choice, there is no debate on this. It would render classes completely unplayable as they don't have dots to linearly multiply their damage and ruin every single players experience.
---
I do it on every server I play on - drown outside of Orgrimmar, run through Felwood - jump down at horde base in Bloodvenom Falls. Run to the boat and when you port you'll be ressed on the boat. Try to run through the tree, you will get killed by guards - run through the tree portal as spirit and continue to the graveyard by the inn. Look out for the guards, the come after you from 30 meters away - ress and go get your owl, and HS.
---
yes, but what about hardiness vs warstomp?  Would a shaman be better off with warstomp in pvp vs stun resist?
---
cool, yeah Shaman was my first choice because I'd like the option to group easily if I decide.  I think that 30/21 spec should be able to heal 5 mans fine but still do enough dps to solo world content/pvp.
---
Thanks for the help

They overtune on private servers and recent datamined information suggests that armor values in original vanilla were less than pservers
---
I was litterely thinking the same. Pen gear is a TBC thing.
---
You ain't gonna be playing classic with a 2.0 client I'm afraid :(
---
They opened independently from patches so weren't in the patch notes, but they were still announced if you e.g. visited the forums. I remember well when [Haomarush](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Haomarush_Europe) was announced and some players began to debate going for a fresh start.
---
I haven't timed it, but I'd say 20 min, not much more.
---
I didn't know there was a pserver called Snail...
---
They’re visual inaccuracies compared to classic. For example I think you could swim through Loch Modan but there was no water
---
Oh hey, that's me, I haven't played wow since 2011
---
Lol I just have had good laughs at movie titles in the past with my wife. Sometimes they just don't sound as cool :P
---
One Chilean movie called Fuerzas Especiales (special forces). It's English title? Third World Police.
---
&gt; (x86)
---
what does this designation mean and why did WoW go in this folder for me  
---
i dont know shite ab computers and ive always wondered
---
I was leveling during vanilla and have played wow for easily 10+ years since BC with a year or two of breaks in there. I can't get over the fact that C'thun doesn't even have over 1 mil health. I remember seeing a druid tank in TBC with over 13k health and was flabbergasted by that and in Wrath seeing the first tank over 50k was crazy. The numbers got so inflated. It's going to be nice going to having only 3 or 4 k health. Everything seems more dangerous.
---
Hearthstone and infrequently on a pserver. Don't want to ruin it though so nothing past what I did months ago to see if I could main a pally...
---
You can heal very easily as shadow! Continue to look for gear with int spirit and + heal. Save that stuff. Keep mana topped off
---
There will be no updates to gear as of what we know right now.   
---
All the above items will all be available in their 1.12 state right on launch, since neither of them was added post 1.10 (Which is where the current loot reconfiguration mention items being delayed untill AQ)
---
I didn't say we were getting a 1.12 client, I actually did say Legion. I said we're getting a 1.12 build running on the Legion client.
---
Retail, Risk of Rain 2, Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005) is what ive been playing
---
Yeah I wouldn't worry, if you want to be a pvp god with engineering and consumables you're probably going to have to stretch for more binds though
---
Generally sound was off since there were so many computers on the floor it could get pretty distracting.  The thing to do was bring a pair of headphones and listen to music or something while you took tickets, that was probably the easiest way to get in the zone!
---
Windfury can’t proc off itself in 1.12.
---
Came to say risk of rain 2 and did not expect others
---
This guy is a fucking legend and you are saying he is "bad" you are funny. He tricked the hunter to run towards him dude watch the video!
---
This build looks fine, minus the slice and dice. You're better off using those combo points on eviscerate for high bursts of damage following up your hemorrhage. You'll have trouble engaging multiple targets at once, but you can usually avoid that situation if you're good at stealth.
---
I'd take the talent points from S&amp;D and put them in improved sap. It fits better with subtlety and will help you deal with multiple enemies.
---
There is no way to run through the tree portal as spirit because you get revived while on the boat or sent back to the Darkshore graveyard if you try and run across the water without taking the boat...
---
Mages have way more and better tricks for when stuff goes side ways. They also scale better with gear. Hunters are only okay in pvp. Mages on the other hand can be argued to be the best class in pvp. You'll be arguing for a long time as warrior fans are dedicated but you could argue it.
---
No real collection without this gem.
---
Is that for a temp or perma ban? I assume temp? But not sure if temp bans existed back then.
---
Easy peasy - play warrior when your brother is online, mage otherwise. If you’re leveling together, you should avoid paying that char alone, it will just put you out of sync.
---
no i get that completely not douchey at all no worries
---
I was mostly responding to WotF vs. Hardiness, but for elemental shamans it's pretty much up to personal taste. Enhancement and resto should probably go orc, but elemental shamans get a ton of mileage out of War Stomp because it gives you a free CL or LHW. It's also a great tool against warriors and rogues, giving you a moment to move out of melee range while you're both perma-slowed. I pick tauren when I play ele sham, but orc is totally fine too.
---
The grinding in charred vale is actually really good.  Lots of east harpy, basilisk, tree mobs.  Good density and respawn worth close town for horde.
---
As you've said, the death penalty in Vanilla wasn't remotely rough when compared to some of the older MMOs that came prior, like AC, EQ, AO etc.
---
I think they struck a good balance in vanilla with regards to accessibility. They didn't want it so brutal that it would turn away people that hated that aspect of older MMOs, but still enough of a part of the experience that you did try to avoid death.
---
indeed my friend
---
Undead priest have an extra DoT and trolls get some kind of curse of weakness thing. Go undead they look better in robes and as casters
---
I didn't make it past the first 20 minutes because of a bug. I loved KOTOR 1 though.
---
I LOVED the p2p nature of the updates. Infinite Scalability. Finally catching up to BitTorrent
---
It could in nostalrius. I have no idea if it did in actual vanilla (because I was a lock back then) but....uh, why would it be different?
---
Depending on the guild you will pve with there is a chance to get the one spot as shadow DPS.
---
Ah, I see your private server experience trumps real vanilla experience again.
---
And, yet, you have it wrong... again. Private servers have mobs/bosses cast everything on cooldown, which Nost, the private server every other server is based on, has said is wrong. This would include fears, of course.
---
So, I can, and I will tell you that warrior stance dancing solves all that because its CD is short enough, and the only thing that mattered was not turning the boss into the raid.
---
Whatever happens I hope Classic stays. TBC killed World PvP with flying mounts, arenas, and sanctuary areas.
---
The two entrances don't help either.
---
Probably got unlucky with timing, if you were online when they grabbed the ticket they would contact in game.  There was also the rare occasion someone was offline when the ticket was grabbed and online when we went to respond but it didn't update to show you online yet.  It was pretty quick to update that though, so I can only think of once or twice that happened to me.
---
Generally speaking though if you were off line and the GM would solve the issue if they could, so it wouldn't have made the difference unless you had to ask them specific questions.  Things like harassment reports were handled as normal, you just got an email instead of a message.
---
Yeah read it wrong, updated it thx
---
I feel you. It sucks. No, there's nothing anyone can do about it. This same post has been made on a million boards before this one. The cycle will never stop.
---
lmao yup i covered some of my bases :)
---
Mage
---
What do you save C and X for?
---
Those weird on-use engineering/low level items are quite OP for winning 1v1 fights, but in BGs I don't see them being that big a deal. Pop that 30 minute cooldown, or a consumable that took you 20 minutes to farm, for 1 extra kill? Or maybe an enemy Rogue takes that moment to show up and finish you off, wasting it. 
---
Great for PvP highlight videos or winning extremely tryhard duels, some niche situations, but not that important in general. Certainly fun though.
---
Goal is level 20 in first sitting on release day. On PS it takes ~11 hours total (paladin). 
---
Guessing on release day it will be closer to the 15 hour range.
---
The best bit here is how your parents didn't toss all your shit out, sell it, or throw it in boxes and that you still have a room.
---
Shaman or Warlock? My ultimate enjoyment is battlegrounds and I love the idea of elemental shaman but I hate the idea of constantly respeccing. Is is viable to run 30/0/21 and heal in a semi-casual raiding guild? How are shamans early on? 
---
My alternative is warlock. They have a spec for both pvp and pve (SM/Ruin) and have it pretty easy while leveling but my heart always brings me back to shaman. I want a class I will feel strong with but at the same time elemental shaman has always been my fav.
---
I get what you're saying, in the end its a business.  Making money is, and will always be, their main objective.  So any changes they feel will draw in more people, or help retain people would normally be a desired goal,  however they said at this time they are willing to bring back Vanilla/Classic WoW the way it was; not the way some people want it to be, not to fix old mistakes, and not to try a new path to see if a better option could have been done.
---
Nost and the other PServers showed that there is an interest in the original game, with all its perceived flaws and imbalance.  Yes, some are downright stupid issues that could be a quick fix that would have little to no impact on the gameplay, but thats not the point, what they are giving us is an opportunity to play the game the way it was, with no changes be them QoL or game changing.
---
So how about we let people get these months/years of enjoyment, the good and the bad, how it was.  Then once we see how successful it is let Blizzard and the community decide how they should proceed in the future.
---
Rip I aint getting money for a few more days... Oh well.
---
On shaman you need a lot since you use everything during combat, and there’s no knowing what totem gets stomped.
---
If it's not hardcore progression then elemental is a choice .  Since guilds will need 40 man for raids. 
---
My best mate was elemental back in vanilla for the first month's in MC but changed to enhance at some point.
---
Get mining and do DM jump runs with a warrior you can make a lot of gold with mining the guaranteed thorium veins at the end.  Google DM jump run if you don't know the pathing.
---
As a shaman you dont need to bind everything, who cares if you have to mouseclick some totems every 5min. When comes to spells, you dont use all of them on a daily basis, if you are resto.  
---
But as a Warlock, if you dont have most your bindings you are crippled, + you need petcontroll also.
---

I will start in Elwynn, do 2 levels of Westfall and head to Darkshore, where I will get to about level 16 before hearthing back to finish Westfall. Then 1 VC run, after that it becomes more complex with zone swapping
---
As i said before.....even IF the bosses are not casting it on cooldown, you're putting alot of pressure on the tank to get it right every time when you could've just played a dwarf and throw a FW on him every 30 seconds......Such an idiot. Learn to read and stop relying on your supposed "True Vanilla Experience". Make some actually valid arguments if you want to legitimize yourself.
---
I know, and I know activision blizzard can just about kill anything with their way of thinking and market-philosophy.
---
What I'm saying is, the only reason Classic is being developed is because people turned to private servers.
---
Piracy might be illegal but it's our most effective way of expressing our disappointment. The moment big companies sees business-opportunities/money go to waste they're awfully quick to think of solutions.
---
If they were to ruin classic with the very thing that ruined it in the first place then kudos to them being blind to the problem. If were lucky we'll have WoW Classic "Classic" in 15 years from now and the circle of WoW will be complete.
---
One guy go for int gear the other for str and stam and agil. Spec shouldn't matter

Are you like actually retarded or something?
---
Kings add 10% of your agility. There's no difference from enchanting 2 dal'rends with 15 agility, and enchanting 2 bone slicing hatchets with 15 agility, it's still 30 agility which is 33 with kings. Holy fuck.
---
That's called an expansion, not a game.
---
Yeah stand outside the bank or ah and you can probably make a buck. Can also sell ports, especially out of Kargath
---
Orc is better overall tbh
---
It even releases with a typo, launched as Haumarush or something
---
Remember the name - Fort Minor
---
I'm afraid 'Classic Summer' will mean the release date will be like September 20th or something...god I hope I'm wrong
---
There is need for it.
---
I mean, Blizzard themselves goes by dwarves. https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/races/dwarf
---
It's called magic resistance reduction in Classic/Vanilla.  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22799](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22799/soulseeker#comments) is an example that has spell penetration. It's useful for landing crowd control for a good amount of classes due to how resists work. Buffs like Mark of the Wild add a good bit of resistance baseline, which makes the stat fairly good in PvP. In PvE you have curses that do the work for you but in PvP you don't always have that luxury.

---
Legendary server is pretty decent. Seige of mirkwood coming for july. MoM atm but content is really easy
---
What do you care about? Pve? Pvp? Things outside ? Both?
---
I guess this week is kinda long
---
This whole thread is petty. 
---
The fact you are even forced to make this choice is dumb. You can play on both sides lol.
---
Lol @using debuff slots for ff and COReck
---
Not min-maxing to the point of faction choice, merely pointing out that since WF is the go to horde side and it doesn't affect cats or bears. Blessings do however, simply makes the playing field more balanced on one side. I wouldn't say that's min-maxing, just stating a simple fact.
---
Totem twisting WF and GoA costs around 3k mana per minute if you want to have full coverage. Like you say, the only guilds willing to go through the trouble would be hardcore guilds that are seeking to min max. How many of those guilds Per server? Maybe two per faction? So then maybe a maximum of 4 ferals will have access to totem twisting like this per sever as opposed to every feral on alliance side having access to the same blessings as their rogue and warrior counterparts. Doesn't exactly seem like a viable option for the masses, which is what we are talking about isn't it?
---
I STILL have friends that don’t get 1.2Mb
---
Know this is off topic here but would you do tailoring / enchanting while you are leveling or pick them up at max
---
Right!? That is what I read too.. I was like uhh... nice?
---
I wouldn't say overthinking, they have a lot in common. Both are solid classes that feel relatively complete and without significant drawbacks in vanilla. Diverse toolkits, good soloing abilities, good overall capacity to handle several different situations and relatively few weaknesses.
---
Mages are often thought to peak a bit earlier in vanilla as they're less gear dependant than warlocks. They also have often a more straightforward playing style and less of a need to prepare/plan ahead, mostly because a fair bit of the warlock utility lies in their pets, and they have a certain dependancy on their secondary resource, the soul shards. This makes mages better at reacting on the fly, but give a warlock the chance to prepare though, and they tend to have an answer for almost every situation.
---
Maybe this would be good to add to the OP for discussion since a lot of people seem to be rolling mages without knowing the downsides of dispels and consumables that can remove a good amount of things for a spec so control and damage window orientated.
---
Your World of Warcraft subscription inclused 2 things.
---
- classic wow
---
- retail wow
---
For retail wow if you want to play the final 10 levels and do the latest and currest content you also need the expansion battle for azeroth.
---
For classic you just need a world of warcraft subscription.
---
One of three facts were from a console
---
Wotlk had more subscribers than vanilla, Never did i say that retail in current situation is better, im unsubbed and waiting for classic.
---
And my guild is actually called NAMBLA and i take it very seriously
---
i would rather lose exp than run back from graveyard, its such a cancer trust me xD
---

Exactly. I’ve been here long enough to remember how bad this subreddit got *before* we had those rules.
---
Basically just spam low effort comments like those. From people that won’t or can’t just use the search box. Or are just karma farming.
---
Did someone try this with VPN? Of course I'm not talking about NA people.
---
I was also torn for quite a while.  I settled on mage due to what I think is a better quality of life.  More bag space, portals, male own food/drink.
---
i personally think the faction doesent matter so much, but that she "forces" him to leave his friends behind is already a deal breaker
---
Healing in PVP is like being Jesus and Satan all in one. You must mend wounds and murder all at the same time and everyone on your team needs you but nobody appreciates you despite you doing half the dps of your teammates while also doing 500% of the healing they dish out. Never expect anyone to use their CC to help you, thats your problem, but OMFG HEALER WHERE ARE MY HEALS WHY ARE YOU SO FAR AWAY WTF I HAD THE FLAG YOU FUCKER.
---
I see what you did there
---
same
---
I sincerely hope you're right sir
---
That doesnt apply to kids only, everyone is affected by social media culture. And kids who play fortnite wont be playing wow(majorityof them anyways) since theyre into another genre.
---
I told Blizzard if they don't release it on my birthday that I'm going to tell my dad.
---
There are some shaman tank enthusiasts that have tanked all 5man content and I believe UBRS as well. Can't do much else outside that though. There are some guides in the shaman discord
---
Windfury stopped proccing off of itself in 1.4.
---
"Atiesh, the Greatstaff of the Guardian"
---
I'm still waiting, Blizzard.
---
Yeah, if it were for something that would have gotten your account taken away, the situation may have changed and the goal might be to just get them out of the game.  Perma ban stuff tended to be more problematic, so there was usually an incentive to remove them quickly.  Smaller offenses held smaller penalties, the shortest being a 3 hours, which was served more as a cold down period than anything.
---
It's not even close to what it was like back then
---
Your mom says it taste great
---
Eh...theres a lot of other factors.  Eventually games have to stop growing, at least games that get to the scale that WoW did.  
---
An absolutely crazy amount of people had tried wow a that point.  Even people that couldnt play in vanilla eventually were able to try it because of getting a better PC/internet/having enough money/whatever.  Eventually the amount of people left that hadnt tried it was going to drop down to an amount that couldnt keep up with people just getting bored/moving on with life/whatever.
---
Wrath is about the end of when there was a big TV ad campaign from what i remember, the Game Fuel promo was done what...midway through the xpac?
---
Look at all their gear sets, think about their general playstyles. Understand that until the later Classic Stages warlocks are a more supportive caster but will eventually gain the ability to go toe to toe with mage DPS and even surpass it. 
---
Do you like fear trolling enemy players more, or sheep trolling enemy players more? Do you want to easily port around to cities or do you want the added group utility of summons? 
---
Can you stomach spending 10mins being your raid/groups vending machine spamming water and food only to go OOM, or can you stomach farming enemies for soul shards just so you can use your utility?
---
Do you want to perma kite, or have a pet tank for you?
---
Do you get off to PoM + Pyros, or slowly killing multiple enemies with dots?
---
People on this sub are more likely to have had a 60, this does not represent everyone who will be playing classic in any way.
---
This is my motivation to get to 60 as fast as possible. I want to sail through STV before the pack, and then I want to come back to STV as a 60 SM/Ruin Warlock and wait for the wave of new players. I will dungeon level my alt later for fun.
---
Never said I was forced, I just want to play with my GF, get some information about the stats and racial abilities, talents, and make a few connections. Now I’m even MORE geared up to roll Horde though.
---
Beautifully said.
---
I don't use them. It just feels awkward using either my thumb or my index finger to hit those keys during combat.  I'm not sure if it's just because I've never used them, and have similar binds across all games I play, but yeah, there's no reason *I couldn't* use them, just don't like to.
---
I play to fill the gap untill classic releases, I dont play for fun.
---
But I play league of legends and overwatch....
---
Ugghh... I know... but thats what my stupid friends are playing. I want classic.. and new friends..
---
Exactly how I'm feeling at the moment for Mage or Warlock. 
---
I did play Mage all up until I switched to DK in WoTLK though....  Maybe I'll go priest this time. Lol
---
Alliance is the easy side anyway. BGs are easier, questing is easier. Success doesn't mean anything when it's given to you.
---
Hear me out ,I recommend you dedicate hard to feral bear tank. They do good damage, super high threat and more stamina and armor than a warrior. If you don't want a warrior druids are amazing. they have stealth which is great in vanilla.
---
I didn't make the google doc nor did I make the post that you replied too lol, was just showing you that druids do have more threat than wars.
---
You don't really need to keep track of everyone else's health and mana bars if you're a mage.
---
Green human, dead human, lanky human, cow.
---
Was Alliance all of vanilla, will be Horde all of Classic. If we end up on the same server we can raise a toast to days of yore.
---
it's like poetry, it rhymes
---
When he says fixing visual mistakes that means they are changing it back to original status.
---
Importing the data into the legion client brought with it some graphics and lighting changes that weren’t present in vanilla.
---
So they are also reverting some things to make it more like vanilla.
---
Aight, cheers.
---
My current internet is still that slow. Max down speed at a whooping 600 Kb/s.
---
That's interesting, it's been so long since the token was introduced I honestly thought they were items you traded.
---
It would certainly be incredibly hard to moderate people not trading cross-game if they did introduce the rule, I just think there's the possibility that they add it to the ToS anyway - even if you're paying the same subscription, having access to two different versions of the game is unprecedented, and we already know that gold, items etc. will not carry over from your retail account in any way. 
---
But as you say, making gold in Classic is going to be so much more difficult than retail that it's probably hardly going to be an issue whatsoever. Thanks for clearing up the token thing.
---
You have the correlation backwards. There are a lot of Warriors, which is why they are the most common tank, and it's why most raids use them. It does not make them optimal. Druids take less damage and put out more threat in the offtank role.
---
Being able to see how many people are alive/dead is pretty useful no matter what you're doing.
---
Re-released nostalrius?? That would've required them to release nostalrius the first time.
---
It depends on what tier of raiding we're talking about as warlocks scale really well with gear. They generally do get beat out by warriors, rogues and mages I believe. I don't think you understand the benefits of being able to stack 20 warlocks worth of dots and debuffs would be, though. Their dots would annihilate the boss while really being of no hindrance to their already competitive dps.
---
yeah, I was more so wondering with totems.  I planned on just clicking them as needed, with a couple more heavy CD-based ones on binds.
---
Or pre-creating macros with common totem sets I could swap in and out as needed.
---
All the orc racials are boring/passive. You racial is battle shout for 15 seconds, ohh boy, how fun. Have fun looking exactly like every other warrior, and fighting over the same 3 axes with every warrior. Then when it's time to use that gear in pvp, all your racials are useless except a chance to ignore stuns, imagine if wotf was passive, and gave a chance to ignore fear, it would be trash and UD with it. Orc are massively overrated by people very invested in this games lore.
---
You're right, that is a dumb idea.
---
*But I'd kinda love it*
---
seeing as he is playing a mage, all the raid frames, the weird "XRaidStatus" box on the right as well as having an extra box for showing tank targets, are all unnecessary and would clear up like 20-30% more screen for him to see if he got rid of it
---
How can people play this game and not realize the aspect ratio is completely wrong? Jesus christ, it just looks so wrong.
---
Ah a fellow Guild wars person I see.
---
Factions was still one of my faves personally.
---
Skip Westfall? I can't imagine such a thing. I have never heard of anyone doing that before. Thats a new one.
---
Mages are god tier in PvP and PvE, and have the best quality of life with excellent AOE farming, ports, blink, and free food/water.
---
Warlocks are emo little bitches who steal mage gear.
---
I can't wait to try to play as much of the game without using these sites as much as possible.
---
I appreciate the fact that they exist, but for how I personally enjoy playing, I didn't use them too much because it felt like a crutch. 
---
This is mainly in regards to questing specifically. For researching where certain materials come from, absolutely used it.
---
The best way to bring back their investment is to provide Vanilla. That's what was asked for and promised. Anything else will alienate the people they want back as subscribers.
---
Everyone want different changes. Blizzard will not try and cater to a thousand different opinions on what those "desirable changes" would be.
---
Classic is a super low-key project. The development team is small and all the actual changes they made are there to lower ongoing costs so they could run Classic with minimal money.
---
I can basically guarantee you that there will be absolutely no changes. Blizzard will just say: "you wanted Vanilla back, this is Vanilla". All during development they very clearly have been doing this.
---
What they will do is bring Classic TBC, Wrath, etc. It's a no brainer for them. They already have the team and they have much better backups of later expansions. Relatively low effort, high rewards. A lot of people will be able to play their favorite expansions and will basically never unsubscribe.
---
You can disagree but let's see who is right after a few years. ;)
---
Wow you have missed out on a better game.
---
What was the bug?
---
Those see some really bad odds.
---
None of them, go ele shaman, moonkin druid or shadow priest!
---
Hmm, that sounds like hyperbole. I highly doubt there are thousands of items like this, I am doubtful if there are even tens of such items. And if they made such a large difference, I would expect to see these in solo play as well, when you're not restricted by the debuff limit. You say that every single player's experience would be ruined but not everyone farms consumables, just like not everyone would farm Gifts of Arthas or other debuff items. Likewise, a class would not suddenly become unplayable because another class has or doesn't have a DoT. It hasn't happened so far, why would it suddenly happen now? I expect we already have pretty good theoretical and tested DPS numbers on different min-maxed spec's DPS against a training dummy. Those DPS numbers are, I'm sure, very skewed towards particular classes (Looking at you, Mage and Warrior.) but I truly wonder if those figures are all that more skewed than actual encounter DPS numbers.
---
Please do not use wowhead :) the best advice we can give you
---
Hey reddit. ATM I'm leaning towards undead warlock with mineing and engineering and picking tailoring up before Zg. But I'm really not sure with the profs. don't see the point in taking tailoring before you can get bloodvine. Since robes of winter night is so close to the epic crafted and the gold save on the cheeper one is equal faster epic mount. Even hear ALC is a good solution. Any input is welcome
---
Lock was one of the most fun classes I played.  I found Mage frostbolt spam to be boring AF
---
It's a slow server
---
They are probably about the same.  Both have bitch duties though.  Mage you are an AI and food/water bitch.  Lock you can be a curse and summon bitch.  Locks have shards which suck big time.
---
As i said this is JUST the money you make when you sell all leather 1-40 and doing pretty much just grinding beasts. Ofc there is the loot of the beasts too like claws, tusks, greens, blues or whatever
---
Its not 100% accurate and was just an estimation of how much money skinning could bring you while leveling.
---
And even when you are just killing beasts 50% of the time up to 60 it would make you something between 150-200 gold just by vendoring which does not sound that bad.
---
Play with my gf or all my friends? 
---
"Easy choice darling, you go play whatever you want, me and my friends are gonna play together, you're free to join or not, your choice."
---
No idea why you're being down voted man, I completely agree. I'm super excited for classic and will enjoy the shit out of it when it drops, but I want it to be complete and polished on release.
---
The same people down voting you now and complaining about no news of release date are the exact same people who will moan the loudest when they find a bug upon release.
---
People need to chill, they said summer, it's April.
---
Bummer
---
Well it's quite popular of course because people want to do deadmines. On private servers at least, many people are skipping it, especially on alts and the like as westfall is seen as a rather inefficient lvling zone. I just skip it because I enjoy other zones more though.
---
Also with the honor system not being implemented in phase 1 there will be less incentive to kill other players.  It'll still happen of course but on most pservers honor has been in from the start which means you're incentive to kill other players while you level up to get rank 3 so you can get an extra 10g off your level 40 mount.  With that incentive removed I think it'll be less of a problem.
---
Bad phrasing on my part - I'm implying they only *thought* wow needs to be softer on players, when it could've been something as simple as players moving on and market saturation. 6 years is a lot of time to hit majority of your target audience. Hence my wording, correlated not caused. 
---
Blizzard eventually noticed that and decided to change the target. In other words, us (fans of vanilla) being left behind was most likely a calculated decision.
---
We have no control over that.
---
Just because the devs have to make certain changes, doesn't mean we should just go ahead and change everything else.
---
This is mainly it, the classes got more fun. Could do with or without on anything else besides expanding classes.
---
yeah the most important ones would be stoneskin/str, mana/fire ress and WF. rest you can prob just click on
---
Whatever passes the time. Pservers, Pillars of Eternity, FFXIV, Might replay P5 again while waiting for The Royal.
---
I was actually able to tank the first few bosses in ZG with the immovable object and death bringer.  My raid was mostly AQ geared. One of my fondest vanilla memories.
---
Depends on how important the ‘friends’ are as well
---
Yeah but what if you're spec'd into survival with the agi boost?
---
I would say the game is not nearly as "rock-paper-scissors" as people like to claim. 9 times out of 10, the better player wins
---
What about profession alts? A mage to disenchant BoE items and make bags with cloth, an alchemist to send herbs to etc..
---
Probably confirmation bias in that case. I was just wondering if the GM client had a "I resolved the problem but don't want to talk to that player. Please send him an automatic message the next time he goes offline" option. :-)
---
Carrion birds offer comparable stats and screech, I'd just get one of those
---
If I had to choose, I would certainly hesitate a lot but mage gameplay seems too simple for me.
---
I mean until AQ, spamming frost bolt is not appealing to me, and in group content it's so easy to keep a sheep, frost nova everything when one mob tries to melee the healer and rest of the time frost bolt to death everything.
---
Drink, repeat.
---
Occasionally, go aoe to kill some packs.
---
I did not push far my experiments on pserver but warlock gameplay looked much more interesting to me.
---
they did. Kevin Jordan (one of the game designers of the original WoW) came onto the Countdown to Classic podcast and explicitly said due to the limitations posed by the debuff mechanic they balanced class pve performance around it.
---
TBC is a more competitive version of classic tbh. Most of what made vanilla great still remains throughout TBC, with both pve difficulty and pvp skillcap increasing by a lot. Yes, it did come with some downsides. Flying mounts for example weren't the best idea. But arenas, dedicated pvp gear, talent improvements, general balance changes and many other things are very good. Don't get me wrong, I like classic and am looking forward to playing it. But I actually hope there'll also be normal TBC released after classic. As I personally prefer TBC over classic mostly due to the competitiveness of pvp, which simply was not there in classic. Classic balance sucks ass and the rank system has nothing to do with skill at all.
---
At least it wasn't a ton of downvotes. But yeah I agree I can't comprehend downvoting someone who is keeping it so real
---
bUt WiTHouT p0sT nAxX c0nTEnt cLasSiC is Ded 0n ArRiVal
---
but why do you care about missing out on loot? maybe if that is so important to you, you should consider powerleveling? I don't see what would be better about giving everybody the chance to start at the same time. people will still do dungeon content, for most classes MC/Ony BiS is 80% blues. it would also take meaning out of the start, because you prevent powerlevelers to get a meaningful reward for their efforts.
---
Huh? Selling a leveling guide violates copyright law?
---
Oh please, you really expect me to believe you got rank 14, Naxx AND Scarab Lord?!? ;)
---
To me it seems like Mages, Warriors and Rogues are beating Warlocks even though the debuffs are being allocated so that the Warlock (or 'locks if the raid can afford it) can pretty much dish out their max DPS. In which case, allowing more debuffs wouldn't really improve their DPS all that much, as they're already pushing their limits and still losing.
---
To know for sure, though, would require training dummy DPS logging from min-maxed class-spec combinations. If a Warlock can significantly increase their DPS on a training dummy with all of their DoTs compared to the usual raid DPS strategy and out-DPS a Mage, then that would definitely put a nail into my argument's coffin.
---
Otherwise, removing the debuff limit would (as far as Warlocks and their DoTs go) just make Warlocks a bit less bad DPS wise compared to just stacking 20 Mages.
---
Written is just so much easier of a format to absorb information from, at least for me.
---
I guess im just much better at reading vs paying attention to speech.  
---
It doesnt help that everyone always wants to show off their internet personality on youtube.  It really gets old :/
---
If I roll an alliance character I might consider doing the same and leveling elsewhere. I played the classic demo and completed all of the Westfall quests so I already have that experience. I might try going elsewhere now.
---
 I love the people trying to compare Perklunt to today's competitive players that down bottles of aderall with 7 billion dpi mice and main lining energy drinks. Perklunt was just a guy that knew his class far better than most and excelled at what he did. And he made one hell of an entertaining pvp video, which most will never do, let alone reach legend status.﻿
---
No it wasn't? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEN9-m1j\_4I&amp;t=955s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEN9-m1j_4I&amp;t=955s) @13 min
---
His [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lochtide7/posts/) has the same mundane low-effort questions in multiple subreddits. He probably just doesn't know any better. 
---
Honestly I don't understand how some people can be so helpless and not see anything wrong in their helplessness. Whenever there's something I don't know, I try to figure it out myself first. Especially when it's relatively simple stuff. When I make a post (which isn't often) it's because it's something worth debating.
---
I would be embarrassed if I made a post asking a straightforward question that a was answered by one sentence in one comment. But someone like Lochtide7 does it over and over.
---
You make a very well-written and well-reasoned argument. I shall agree with you. I will leave out thoughts of any changes or improvements to Classic for now.
---
You can hit 60 in winterspring also, usually less crowded
---
Depends on the fight. If the fight requires everyone on full health for as much time as possible, then yes HOTs will only rarely use their full potential healing because the paladins and priests heal up quicker. If it doesn't matter how fast Rogue#3 gets from 50%-100% as long as he's back to full in 30sec then its smarter to reign in your priests/paladins and let the HOTs do the work simply because they can do more productive things in the meantime.
---
Heck, we did do this even on lower tier bosses who where already on farm just to save on potions/consumables. 
---
In the end every healer has its place. As a paladin that managed to see Naxx I can say that I always cursed about paladins lack of multi target heals and lack of HOTs. 
---
Just pushing insane amounts of overhealing into a target that can't take two hits from the boss in a row without dying and keep this up for the entire fight? Thats nothing that a druid can keep up for long and the paladin excells.
---
I'm so enlightened I'm ready to ascend. Take me!
---
Sounds good. Let us wait and see! :)
---
Your make it seem even harder to chose lol
---
And Silithus and Burning Steppes as well, though I don't remember if this server had the revamped Silithus that wasn't completely empty yet.
---
When should it be used? When you see someone casting a fear? What about classes that don’t cast their fear?
---
20 edits later hahah
---
Big fat fony!
---
For the record, unless you are one of the 5% of people well ahead of the pack in leveling you will likely find a ton of magic wands at-cost on the AH. I believe only a few silver. I'd even say it might be worth leveling the Paladin first because then you can give your mage the wand at level 1 and level 3x as fast to 6.
---
What classes are best to spam it on?
---
Haha yeah, technically that would be possible, but it would also be running the risk the player would submit the ticket again, presumably with your GM name in the ticket if it were a more sensitive issue.  
---
Even in a case where I saw the player was upset in the ticket, it would be way easier to resolve the issue head on than try and side step it and have them submit another ticket more upset.  This would happen by accident sometimes, where you did happen to catch them in a relog and they submit a ticket again right away, so there wasn't really a desire to make it happen purposefully, at least not for me.
---
Warlocks consistently out dps mages in Naxx :)
---
Every class has its pitfalls. Every class has its advantages. You gain and lose nothing by choosing either. Hope this helps and doesn't help.
---
The killing field.
---
Ok guys I'm stuck. I'm between a Warrior and a Shaman. I tanked for so long and I absolutely love it. On the other hand I don't know how much raiding I'll be doing this time around, so the hassle of being useless leveling doesn't sound fun. I never really played horde and Shamans look great. If it matters I will likely have several friends to play with.
---
I am a **huge** fan of the detail put into the forums, as well as how snappy and quick they are when moving around different threads. Awesome job in this department, I'll definitely be using this.  
---
I'm not a fan of the home page and it's design. The colors are really...strange, and the layout it a bit off-putting. I also think there are far too many videos that just get pushed into your face right away.  
---
TLDR; Awesome Forums (will be using), but if I didn't spend a few extra minutes to find it, the initial design and home page would have turned me away.
---
They obviously don’t want competition for the Swamp Jaguars.
---
To be fair the mods here make it pretty difficult. Extremely easy to get banned
---
I still have 10mb ADSL :(
---
I liked how grounded the setting was. No shiny mounts and flashy spells.
---
Yea men, so was grim, drakedog etc. Doesn't change the fact that they're bad by modern standards but were great in 2005
---
But that still exists in retail.   You literally can go do that.
---
Yea I can speak to the evolution.  I can remember turning my nose at the deep feral spec, really because I was discounting HOTW and from what I have learned now it might be one of the best specs especially in situations like we had where we ran druid heavy.  Req was not set up to utilize Bear offtanks and with the game evolved now I could see very good hybrid druids being utilized in a much different way. BTW if you PM me your FB id I can add you to the Req FB group.   This is Kabael fyi in case you hadn't figured out.
---
Fair enough, in the end it's all down to subjective perspective, The rogue might consider himself an efficient player, sure he doesn't have his full BiS but he has 3 or 4 pieces rather than just taking whatever he happens upon, In that same vein the feral might feel like a slacker for only bringing 3 pummelers to tonight's raid. Hard to draw an objective line.
---
But I would argue that if farming the gold for respeccs is out of the question, then that would most likely cover farming gold to max out on consumables as well. Sure you might get world buffs but I somehow doubt that a guild that doesn't enforce consumes or proper specs would bother with the management of shuffling people around DM, Zandalari isle, Orgrimmar then felwood.
---
And at that point you've got a generalist spec, few or no consumables, and no world buffs, are you truly bothering with efficiency?
---
Again i'm not saying any mentality on the topic, mine yours or that guy over there's is wrong, but I would argue that the ones on "my" side of the spectrum are the ones who truly care for efficiency.
---
Says the guy who will stomp bgs with purge stun resist wotf and windfury
---
I just simply disagree. Using that logic we should have ZG/BWL, AQ, and naxx from the start.
---
I think gating the content is smart, and would provide a smoother and more exciting experience.
---
There's so much dungeon content to do at 60, and so the powerlevelers will still be rewarded. Gating MC/Ony doesn't take out meaning from the start. It adds to it.
---
There's so much content before 60 and at 60,i just don't see any downsides to gating the first raids, and only the positive impact of an exciting launch that people would experience at the same time.
---
That wasn't exactly my intention of the voicing in that sentence.  "All my Alliance friends" was a more *mesa* aspect, in that everyone on that side was a person I could have had on a friends list.  Now that I'm going horde i'll have to make new connections and learn new things.  I was simply trying to put this out there to gather the information I was asking about, but it looks like i'll just have to do the legwork myself.
---
Yeah I mean you'll go oom in 60 seconds instead of 30.
---
I remember when I first started playing, my dad was shocked while downloading the game because it took up gigabytes.
---
It's not odd at all.  Pvp servers being significantly harder to level on is something that makes the journey more worth while and the send of achievement when you get to 60 that much greater.
---
Look up the locations of rare mobs spawns. There is a Trogg that spawns with a chest deep in one of the caves out there. Can drop a nasty 2h green mace. You’ll also have a shot with the chest as well. I’d grab a buddy and race to that.
---
Can't wait to continue to never use shitty wow head again. Will likely still use a classic private server database as they are simple and clean. Wowhad is a bloated mess
---
Rip TotalBiscuit, that was seriously a wonderful podcast.
---
average and median is different
---
A dude having a 30mb speed will inflate the average a lot
---
What is ontop to the left?
---
30 minutes outside SanFran, and there is no kind of broadband? That's actually pretty messed up. However, I guess if you want that sort of seclusion, it works in your favor. Close to the bright lights of the big city, but worlds away.
---
I wouldn't say slowly, lets not forget how hard shadowbolt hits in later tiers.
---
There is absolutely an over-emphasis on Frost mages, although to some extent it is warranted. The problem here is that Frost became the de facto PvP spec for mages in later expansions to such an extent that it has pretty much painted over most people's image of mage specs in PvP even in Classic.
---
Frost mage has some serious weaknesses in vanilla, such as the only means of stopping damage pushback being in the form of Improved Arcane Missiles, which I've seen plenty of Frost mages skip at that. At that point you have no means of defending yourself against something like a Hunter pet as soon as your Ice Barrier drops.
---
Frost mages are also the weakest of all mage specs against other casters. The base concept of Frost compared to Fire is to trade in some damage for slows, but casters don't care about that. Your Ice Barrier will also just get dispelled by Priests and Shamans. And yes, you can time your Ice Barrier to be just before a cast completes, but frankly a Chain Lightning/Mind Blast may just break through anyway. It's not really a winning move, and if it crits it's a straight up losing move.
---
I personally consider Elemental to be the best spec. It trades in Ice Barrier for Blast Wave, giving you an undispellable AoE slow and an additional instant cast nuke. With an extra instant cast from Blast Wave and a shorter cooldown on Fire Blast you become more mobile. Scorch with Burning Soul provides incredible resistance to damage pushback, and your Fire spells are generally much more powerful instead of just being fillers like in Frost.
---
The catch is that Elemental trades in its safety of Ice Barrier, and the guaranteed silence on Improved Counterspell. Meaning you suddenly have a lot less HP to play with, and you also can't miss your Counterspell. Because of that, whether Elemental is the better choice for you depends on if you can deal with your lower health pool, and if you're confident in landing your Counterspells. Because of that, I do believe that Frost is the better choice for *most* people, but if played properly, I consider Elemental superior.
---
Ok, so the "old" Vanilla/Nost API allowed for some seriously automated scripting in the form of macros which had a huge impact on gameplay, bots and who knows what else that Blizzard saw. So they scrapped it and we have what we have now in retail pretty much starting from TBC.
---
How about that login music?
---
Thank you! Kinda forgot we were all melee attempting in. This will make my pally leveling start much easier
---
#playingsincebeta . . . Anyone else?
---
IIIIttt'sss the illusion of choiceeeeee
---
Oh! That's a surprise to say the least :)
---
Did you just say you pay for Wowhead? What....in the......wut?
---
50 lashings!!
---
Just to be clear, in case I sounded negative, the few times I needed a GM I was always impressed with the helpfulness and friendliness they resolved my issue.
---
I'm playing a lot of go for long walks and build leg muscle, so that when classic does come and I'm sitting for 16 hours at a time I maybe won't get leg blood clots and die.
---
Mm, that is true.
---
When you realize you’ve hacked the game because you’re Mr. T and happen to be pretty handy with computers.
---
What else should be posted, man? Yet another thousand "What class should I play?" threads? 
---
I'm glad I enjoy the memes even though I'm no teenager. It sounds so rough when people hate on them all the time. It's just people who are trying to make fun out of a dreadful situation of endless waiting.
---
Or you put a 5th mage in there and the group does 15% more damage than it would with the oomkin

Check out the "Patches and Hotfixes"
---
1.12 is well after DRs were added to Vanilla. You can still chainfear and stunlock someone to death, sure, but you can't chainfear or stun someone forever. The second fear will be half as effective as the first, and so on.
---
?????  
---
40 person raid, 28 dps players all doing 1k damage each, reduce 1 of them to 250 and its just under 3% loss.
---
Kerbal Space Program
---
True, but that final line I typed as I pictured a turtle in AV. If you're a mage you're looking to PoMPyro cheese some shitters and as a warlock you're just dot spamming to rot damage everything you can.
---
Frost Shock spam was nerfed in 1.4, so you can't kite indefinitely with it anymore in PvP
---
Oh come now, those are not hitting hard...if you wanna se hard, wait 'til my Curse of Doom Expires on Ossirian the Unscarred the exact moment he goes into Shadow-Vulnerability :D
---
do you have  threads about that ? i'm really looknig for this
---
You lost me at "Not speed leveling"!
---
corpse run there was a BITCH and allies town is much closer than any horde outpost. RIPerino those quests if allies are out and aboot
---
No worries, I didn't take it that way at all!  Hope I was able to shed a little light on the topic!
---
“and that you still have a room” I’m gonna go be sad now.
---
I would love new content down the line, but not a new TBC. I’m not sure how they could do it without angering many people though, and they seem to be listening to their audience. They risk splitting the fan base/population if they run a classic server and a tbc server separately, but also risk people leaving because they want classic to stay the same and #nochanges
---
Im talking about pvp
---
If you don't plan on raiding it's fine
---
Glorious
---
Ah gotcha very true
---
Wait i thought it was 2 questions. Wtf?
---
what happened in EQ death?
---
didn't druid only have battle rez?
---
I’m pretty sure this is antidisestablishmenaccuratism.
---
OCD btw xD
---
More like Bass to Mouth. Or was it Ass to Trout?
---
I think they shut down WoW completely or go free to play after classic and the next couple retail expansions. You can't just release an entire online mmo, and the ludicrous amount of expansions that accompany it. 
---
Or maybe you can.
---
I hate this mentality. The private server community brought this to a head, and they have made quite a few changes to the game that were accepted among them.
---
But only their changes right?
---
It really doesn't. TBC was peak class mechanics, what is there now in BfA is an abomination.
---
Heh, I remember manually winding tapes as a kid. 7 year old me thought it was neat that you could do something physical/mechanical and it'd do something (almost) digital.
---
Like deleting stuff off your hard drive by wiping it with a cloth.
---
If your girlfriend hates Mr. T, then that means she hates the old Mr. T cartoon, which means she never let his advice each episode on how to be a better person sink in.

That's why she's a terrible person.

If your girlfriend hates Mr. T, then that means she sided with Rowdy Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff and Cowboy Bob Orton at Wrestlemania 1, which means she never let Hulk Hogan's advice each week on how to be a better person sink in.
---
If your girlfriend hates Mr. T, it's because she used to be a slave owner, and Mr. T is the one who led the assault on her plantation and freed the slaves. Then she didn't let his advice on how to be a better person sink in.
---
It is for sure one of those three reasons, but I don't know her so I'll let you figure out which it is.
---
No, now we have to download and install our video game updates on day 1.
---
Its a different time. I'd argue its mostly better, but there are a few things that 30 years ago we would've laughed at.
---
Agrees in shadow priest
---
I really appreciate your perspective. I think I am going tauren. Plus, I really like the starting zone and its much less contested on a new server. Spending the first 30 levels in one dry wasteland after another can get fatiguing.
---
Some things in TBC went downhill, some things were the best they have ever been in WoW. TBC was a mixed bag, just like vanilla, but the game is totally worthy of a re-release
---
Yeah that’s still amazing to me. Back in 2011 or so, I wouldn’t have even been judgmental of the game if it lost some subs. I was judgmental of the expac that lost them, and it felt way too connected. Doesn’t help that the numbers took a huge dive.
---
Guys I played an alliance rogue, and never once noticed hardiness proc on anything but a warrior. 1/4 is a much smaller chance than you think, and it was just never an issue, it probably did a few times but it never mattered, if it's not wearing plate I might be opening with ambush anyway. Especially because they don't have something like warstomp to peel with. Dont get me wrong, orcs are good, but the tribal orcish circle-jerk on these forums is embarrassing. Humans are the same way, great to get gear with, but now your only pvp racial is perception...eww...
---
Level 60 Rogue. Mannoroth Horde checking in.
---
It really is😍
---
I would love to have lived in the timeline where they made the opposite decision, though. I don’t want to hate the live game, haha.
---
Every day classic isn't released is worse than the last day. So every time you see me post here it's literally the worst day of my life.
---
Planetside 2
---
A new update is being released today!
---
Also this is an era where people straight up murder and rape one another without much (sometimes no) social stigma whatsoever.
---
So..... if Tormund Giantsbane is being cute..... he's probably long given up the prospect of trying to mount you against your will.
---
Plus..... I think half the reason why he wants to fuck her is because she would chop his dick off if he did, in fact, try to do her against her will.
---
&gt;it's pretty much up to personal taste. Enhancement and resto should probably go orc, but elemental shamans get a ton of mileage out of War Stomp 
---
Not sure if it will be included in classic, but afaik tauren hitbox was also larger which is something to consider as an advantage for enhance and a disadvantage for ele/resto.
---
I don't disagree; fans deserve the opportunity to play TBC. However, as someone who hated TBC since its release, I would prefer Blizzard to split in two directions: Vanilla+, and more Classic servers leading up to Wrath.
---
What's going on [there](https://imgur.com/dc6ahLe) OP?
---
And Friends. Clear dungeon for certain bop while you wait outside to not incur XP gain. It's a trying process, but highly rewarding once you get to a point where you're wrecking people.
---
Man, the LoS problems in SFK on the stair section with the wolves bring nightmares. Between not thinking you'll body pull and others going LoS of heals, its a mess! So fun tho!
---
The most favorited xpacs of all time are TBC and WOTLK, not vanilla. We want them the way they were
---
“Once Naxx is on farm”
---
I want this. Progression through alternate means, be it resistance gear,  new tactics,  ways of making less viable classes more useful, level cap still at 60 with no new talents or skills. (As much as I’d love vampiric touch)
---
I do believe the hardiness vs WotF is blown out of proportion. Hardiness is RNG, 75% of the time it doesn’t work. Meaning you can’t rely on it to win a fight. Will it help win some fights? Yes, but most the time it won’t. WotF will help turn the fight 100% of the time when you use it. 
---
People also vastly overestimate how many classes will be stunning you. It’s true most classes have access to some form of stun. But the reality is not all classes get them. Take hunter for example. You need 21 points in BM for the stun. However hunters that are raid spec do not go that deep in BM. So maybe half the hunters don’t even have it. Priest also have a stun, but only if they are shadow, and even then it’s like a 10% proc chance. The majority of priest aren’t shadow. Sure anyone can use a grenade, but lots of people won’t be engineering, and it seems like people miss with their grenades like half the time anyway. 
---
In practice basically 90% of the stuns you will face will come from Rogues, Paladins, and Druids. Compare that to fear, which is Warlocks, Priest, and Warriors. Each ability is a big counter against 3 classes. So to me the question of hardiness vs WoTF comes down to which three classes do you want to counter more. 
---
Both choices are good for PvP. The gap between these two abilities isn’t as big as people say.
---
I like this.
---
It should be the lord if the rings collection in extended edition
---
I'm with you man. Our discord has like 2-3 people on at any given time. Launch day of a new mmo/xpac? Like 20. It's a blast, even if the servers are shit.
---
It’s like that whole long “you think you do but you don’t” speech. Remember when you had to go to the city and say LF tank LF tank LF tank? Nobody wants that. Remember when you had to run through the world? Again, you think you want that but you really don’t.
---
It’s like they didn’t account for the fact that, 2004 could have given everybody free level 1 chopper mounts, a queue system, etc... I love that Ion was so influential as a guild master of Elitist Jerks that he became the Lead developer over time, but I don’t think he has the same philosophies as the people who made the game he loved.
---
You are going to have total boobs, first experience.
---
You are going to have players like yourself, really young in 2005, foggy memory.
---
You'll have guys like me, already grown up with rise colored glasses.
---
You'll have elitist jerks that think it's a big deal they have dissected a 15 year old game and know everything.
---
You'll have the stoners that forgot they ever played that game man!
---
There are alot of different groups that enjoy this game
---
Just find the right crowd for you
---
Sucks that it comes to that with any company huh?
---
That, and it's so much more possible to die in the open world.  In live, if there's 3 enemies in a pull, they're all 1/3 the strength because they're designed to be taken out as a group.  Or, if there's a boss enemy in the open world, it's all avoidable damage as long as you avoid the glowy pools on the ground.
---
In Classic, if there were three enemies, they were three normal enemies and it sucked trying to fight them, because 3 enemies will do 6x the damage while you try to kill them.  If there was a boss, it was a ?? elite that roams around that you FEAR.
---
After purchasing the blizzard balance do I immediately have to activate an account or can this balance be held until the release of Classic?
---
Wouldn't this mostly just make warrior and rogues even stronger by letting all the warriors rend and the rogues rupture (If this is even a dps increase over eviscerate) ? Shadow priests and moonkins would still go oom and not be viable specs out of that perspective either way.
---
You respawn at your bind area (not too sure what that actually means, I've only read about this) without any gear.  You had to run to your corpse to loot your gear back (so you could aggro mobs, and you were basically naked).  Your corpse also decayed within like 7 days which meant if you couldn't get to it, you'd lose all your gear forever.  
---
Also the old game had no map.  So you had to remember where you died and how to get there, or get other people to help you get your corpse back.
---
This. Don't be a dickhead gatekeeper, be nice to the kiddies. The ones with zero attention span either won't get far or they'll learn a deeper appreciation for MMOs and RPGs BECAUSE of WoW and will have a better attention span for gaming.
---
I welcome anyone to try and get into it, git gud, and join me. The entire reason why i'm stoked for dungeons again is that the braindead impatient types can't just autorun through every dungeon anymore.
---
WoW will be an actual RPG again!
---
A lot of people say Vanilla isn’t hard because death doesn’t mean anything. I obviously disagree, it means you got beaten and have to waste 5 minutes, that’s loss enough.
---
Haha sorry! I love leveling, but not rushing everything. I like to see the quests lines and read some lore! 😂
---
I wouldn't settle for a definite build yet but from my experience combat is the fastest but subtlety is definitely the most FUN leveling specc. It's also cool to just gouge backstab the mobs, doesnt even need an ambush.
---
Currently I'm slowly grinding in MHW. I've played the 3ds versions, but the PC release seems to be on another level.
---
Did you ever get really into a hobby you later quit? An instrument  You remember the way movement felt in your body, the sound, lots of sensory details and emotional connections. Specific details are fuzzy. Then you pick up the instrument one day and your fingers are in the wrong spot, you hit a bad note, but as you mess around it comes back.  You remember that one piece you worked really hard to learn because you loved the song, but the piece you learned because your teacher told you to is completely gone. 
---
It is like that. I remember everything about my class, because I did it every day. As the leader of a raid guild I half-remember how every other class worked in PvE. I have zero clue how they functioned in PvP. At all. I remember timers on resources because I organized massive, multiple-guild, farming operations for materials for raiding. I remember what went into each potion/flask because I was an alchemist and made literally tens of thousands of them. I have no idea what the mats for other professions were. I barely remember high level enchanting mats only because I needed them for my own gear. I remember Wailing Caverns because I ran it multiple times on my main and then my alt. I don't remember... that one in Blasted Lands, where the Enchanting guy is, because I ran it once for quest completion and never again. You see the trend.
---
People between the ages 10 and 30 all loved the game. The concept of everyone being teenagers is moronic.

Why? We have Native American Cows and Space Goats... Warcraft is full to the brim with anthropomorphic races inhibiting various cultural stereotypes. What is wrong with Asian Pandas lol?
---
'done' does not mean 'developed to perfection'
---
Vanilla was released in a state that was far from 'developed to perfection'. It didn't have a working PvP system. It had to completely overhaul talents for hunters, paladins, warriors, and druids. High pop servers would crash on a regular basis, it would have days of downtime on patch days, and it was full of incredibly broken shit.
---
Ah, I wager you're playing on uh...... 
---
Father of Zeus...... Ten minus eight (in roman numerals)
---
As far as runbacks specifically, it wasn’t something I *thought about*. I would just wipe to a boss, run back, and it would be so short it was over before it stated. Obviously I noticed they were shorter, but I guess after playing Vanilla again, it makes the difference just that much more obvious and apparent.
---
Your mana regen is the same whether you are in combat or not.
---
This has got to be a troll...
---
I recommend you watch the Blizzcon from 2018 on YouTube where they specifically talk about how difficult it has been and will continue to be to restore it. It’s not as easy as throwing the old data back over the source code. Their internal systems have all changed since then.
---
Lol I laughed.

He never said boomkins would out DPS any non hybrid, he just said they aren't as miserably terrible as everyone says they are.

Settle down.

Bruh its April.

Ayyyeee preeeel.
---
I live in Southwest Florida and even I respect the fact that it isn't actually summer quite yet. Even though its like 80 degrees outside.
---
there was a thread last week about it
---
I raided as a warlock through all of Vanilla and only getting to cast Curse of elements and shadowbolt for years was not very fun.  YMMV  
---
Shamans have a variety of playstyles and bring a tremendous amount of utility to a group or raid.  Respeccing can be  pain but it better than being stuck doing one things for months/years.  My 2 cents.
---
damn i'd love to see this
---
If the debuff limit stays so does the original realm caps. #nochanges
---
No. TBC needs some changes.
---
Yup, Same here. All I can get. Large downloads I use my phone hotspot, but streaming and playing wow works fine. 
---
Some day maybe...
---
I was in the same boat as you but you gotta think about all the things you'll be doing in classic. Leveling is a big one and for me eating/drinking after every 3 or so mobs gets really old imo, being able to life tap and keep going with a quick bandage makes the leveling experience a lot more enjoyable for me. On the flip side mages also have the huge benefit of aoe grinding for xp/gold. I've also mained a mage for a while on retail and warlock is the last class in wow I haven't played at cap so it was an obvious choice for me.
---
Great read! Really nice how it goes one by one for each skill
---
Native American could refer to thousands of different cultures spread out between 10 countries. 
---
Space goats is made up and new.
---
Asian pandas are a lazy design choice and closely mirrored a popular movie ala Kung fu panda. It was a cash grab and shit theme.
---
WoTF and canabalize really helps as a warrior. Saves on food and bandages.
---
No I'm not trolling it's a serious question?
---
Grats on the soon promotion!
---
If the alpha runs for a month and the beta for another month it's fine
---
Negative. I'm playing on the wing of a netherdrake......
---
Totally agree, I was 30 when I started playing wow! I still got the epic feeling first time walking into Ironforge, or Orgrimmar. Truly huge cities with hundreds of wee players going about their own business! I was hooked.
---
I’ve got a wife, 2 kids and a demanding job and I’m now 45yr old, but I cannot wait for classic to start playing all over again. 😂
---
&gt; since the people that are vouching against memes never take the time to think why is it they see SO MANY memes here.
---
The reason that we see so many memes here is because the nature of Reddit is that posts that require no effort to consume get upvotes.
---
~6% of the posts in r/wow are memes, art, and jokes. Yet, &gt;60% of the posts in the first page of r/wow are memes, art, and jokes. It's because the design of reddit is shit at promoting discussions.
---
2 60's, my main was a Paladin that raided from MC to C'Thun second stage (Naxx wiped my Guild) on Mal'Ganis
---
I’m lurking through old posts because I really want to play a Druid in classic.  My first character ever was a Druid in 2004.  I shared an account with my brother so once I got my own I went pally and regretted it.  
---
So my question is, how were Druid’s healing in raids?  Mostly spamming low rank HT right? I remember them being really good and great MT/OT healers, plus there aren’t a lot of Druid’s so you get geared really quickly.
---
Better except for those stupid missions where you're forced to play as characters other than your jedi... those parts annoyed the heck out of me.
---
I down-vote and hide all the memes and the 'look at how badass i am!!!!!111' screenshot posts. People who post of a lot of them go on my ignore list. It sucks that you have to curate your own content to keep the forum relevant but that is the nature of Reddit.
---
The maps don't change in WoW like they do in Diablo...
---
Are you planning to grind a lot? Because quest wise there isn't nearly close to enough to take you from one zone to the other after loch modan.
---
I remember so much and it all comes back watching more and more YouTube videos.
---
Veterans will still make noob mistakes, but that’s half the fun.

I need 8 more people in my neighborhood to sign up for 1gb fiber, so i'm hounding my landlord to pass out flyers lol
---
Funnily a friend and I talked about the same thing yesterday. This subreddit has become a waste of time. It also doesn't help that anything that could lead to a discussion is being drowned by the #nochanges drones, who are incapable of reasonable discussions.
---
Well, it could lead to things like 40-man Paladin rekbombs with 40 stacks of Judgement of the Crusader( +6k Holy damage) or some weird shit.
---
I hope not. Part of the charm of WoW Classic is that we know exactly what we’re getting. Do I trust 2019 Blizzard to make new content for WoW Classic and not fuck it up? Fuck no.
---
You guys need to communicate and, at least with each other, be more willing to compromise. Especially when I think we can all agree the point here is to play and enjoy each other. 
---
Really odd hills you guys are choosing to battle and die on. These arguments I have with my friends not S.O. and even then just to give em shit, not seriously try and constrain choices.
---
If orc tanks with an axe it's much better.
---
I'm going to play gnome warrior, and I will maximise darnassus rep along the way (leaving level 1 for Teldrassil). Darks hire is great but I will need a détour in the Loch, because I assume Westfall will be over saturated. Then the maximum of zones in kalimdor with the obligatory trip to EK when you need to, which is quite often.
---
They did break down by class and combination. They even talked about it back in Vanilla.
---
They talked about Priest vs Druid healing and how the mechanics of some fights made it impossible for Druid healers so they tuned the fights not just by numbers, but by types of actions and CC required. All the way down to the 5 man level.
---
Reason: as a game designer, you need to consider the whole when making balance changes, even if it's just numbers passes. We've seen classes become ridiculously OP just from a numbers pass alone, as well as content trivialized.
---
Games development is about a lot more than just "increase or decrease health/damage.
---
No it does not lol
---
Add ons are not hacks, not sure why you think they're the same.  Add ons allow customization within certain restrictions blizzard deems acceptable.

It was pretty bizarre and frustrating. All of my friends through middle school and high school played WoW, but I didn't have a good enough connection. By the time I left for College and had good Internet Cataclysm had dropped and I no longer had an interest in playing (plus the majority of my friends were over it).
---
It was definitely a different experience, growing up in a little pocket of rural lifestyle in the middle of a major metropolis area.
---
Good old Vagash aka snow-Hogger
---
I suppose it's the same sort of people who felt in D&amp;D if you died you should restart at level 1, regardless of the level of the group.
---
&gt; Totem stomping with your pet and rotating fears between multiple people becomes a necessity.
---
Fear has a short range in vanilla, and in within fear range of multiple people in a BG, as a class with no mobility, you're just asking to be shit-stomped.
---
What changes have they/we made? They only wanted it to be bliz-like for better or worse. 
---
2 hour cd on world buffs? Well that was blizzlike so ill deal with it
---
Mobs having abilities that root/net ability making them unable to aoe farm? Well very meticulous reaseach shows that that was blizzlike so i guess mages will find another way to farm gold.
---
Which people are definitely sleeping on, stoneform in the rogue mirror matchup is no joke
---
High dps staffs with spirit are now considered pretty solid for leveling warriors. You weren't a noob, you were WAY ahead of the curve!
---
Leveling with a Warrior isn't so bad if you have a backup spirit set and keep First Aid up. Downtime is significantly reduced.
---
East Asia is a giant place with thousands of different cultures... Pandas are a synthesis of various East Asian myths, legends, cultures and traditions. Not to mention Pandaren existed before Kung Fu Panda. If it was anything it was to appeal to their large Asian demographic in China. It only mirrored Kung Fu Panda because you're assuming Kung Fu Panda came up with the themes it used and didn't just borrow them from East Asian the same as MoP. They both put a western spin on an Asian aesthetic.

Exactly. Also she isn’t defenseless or vulnerable, which is a big component in creepiness. She could kick his ass probably, and he’d like it the whole time, but he can’t just overpower or corner her like most men could do to most women.

Ahhh
---
Im set on playing Druid come classic. Love the class fantasy, and have been playing one retail since WotLK; never got to experience it in Classic so Im excited to give it a go. 
---
My classic experience is pretty limited as I started playing just before BC launched; as such Im having some trouble deciding on faction. I have a couple friends who are undecided as well so there is no help there lol. Both Tauren and NE appeal to me, so race choice doesnt matter. Does one faction have a more enjoyable leveling experience? Ive been Alliance since I started playing Wow, so im leaning Horde just to see the other side, but Im easy going. 
---
And secondly, proffessions. Skinning/LW, or herb/lch is what Im choosing between. I like the idea of being able to craft my own gear/fill in slots as I go, but would also like to be be able to have a steady stream of income, and ive been told that herb/alch is better for that?
---
Any input would be great!
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Its not. But it scratches the itch
---
Ok I agree that it was a bad example. But you were not allowed to change the UI in any was what so ever. Same in SC. Or any other MMORPG on that time, that I know of.
---
Just gonna roll a Tauren of some sort and be a helpful travelling stranger
---
Yeah, I just recently found the old manual. I think it was based on the Beta, and the company that printed them (not Blizzard) didn't have enough time to rewrite them print them out before the game released, so we got the manual for the Beta basically lmao. Most of the stuff is accurate though, right?
---
I remember running a lot.
---
Personally I am all about alliance. Also,  because Tauren are so big they feel so slow to me so I just can’t play them.
---
Is love to just play through all the raids scaled to level 60 content. Do kara bt ulduar icc firelands
---
Haha, except I could have sold it for some serious gold on the ah
---
I would take that release date if they told me right now that it was confirmed. Because that means a cozy winter break full of wow
---
I had an NE Priest, Undead Priest and Orc Warrior all 60 during vanilla.  I did have a friend who in TBC made it his thing to get every class to max level though, was pretty impressive!
---
&gt; Are you like actually retarded or something?
---
Irony.
---
I've still got the 4 CD pack, didn't know there was a version of the box with 5 CD's. 🤔

---
When Blizzard launched WoW it was buggy and the UI was a disaster, they were having to bring extra servers online to keep up with demand and rescue players falling endlessly below the barrens.
---
Basically some haggard developer manager in a board room somewhere sat around a big table with Mike Morhaime and other Blizzard execs. He loosened his tie and took a long gulp of his 10th cup of coffee that day after being awake for 72 hours.
---
“Look gentleman, we can fix the bugs but it will take time. User experience we probably won’t even get to for another year. My advice? Release the API there are 400,000 nerds trying to access this game right now, there’s probably going to be a million in a year. Some of them are likely already playing with custom UIs because they’ve already broken our encryption. Let them fix the UI and User Experience.”
---
How do you like Risk of Rain 2 compared to the original?
---
Disable pictures and javascript with a proper browser. This should bring stuff like reddit down to managable data volume.
---
Any rogue vs rogue duel, an orc is favored to win. Even if he gets opened on. Your 5 second kidney shot resisted? Good game, you lose.
---
Osrs, Rocket League and pserver.
---
&gt; I want to stop but I can’t
---
Pfffff I can stop whenever I want to!
---
They have purples that early now?
---
But would you remember the gold better than you remember your first purp? I think not.
---
Sure
---
no it's not the same argument, because raiding and dungeons are fundamentally different things. you need 4, maybe 10 players for a fungeon. you need 40 for a Raid. Raiding is the defining characteristic of many guilds, so taking that away to prevent a minor powerboost is just not worth any hypothetical benefits of a "smooth experience".
---
by the way, MC/Ony was out at the release of the game back in 2004, and people knew from the beta that MC existed. gating the other raids is done to mirror the vanilla experience, just as not gating MC/Ony is.
---
Surviving Mars. Maybe Emperator later today since it just came out. Or is releasing later today? Not sure.
---
Chen was a character before Kung fu panda yes, but his skills and class were all unknowns.
---
Meaning they chose the Kung fu theme after Kung fu panda released. 
---
Native cultures are more varied than the almagamation they tried to use here.
---
I don’t think MoP was a good representation of the culture I think it was a very small portion of it and it does not fit in.
---
Indians are also Asian, Japanese, some Russians, Koreans and many others that are distinctly different than what we got in MoP.
---
I’m downvoting you because you are trying to defend the shittiest theme ever for an expansion.
---
Demon bell, no charm, Purification ending ;P
---
Yes. Not to do heavy RP but hopefully end up on a server with a smaller but more mature population. Also generally hoping for more immersion in terms of character design, e.g. fewer pink-haired gnomes.
---
In perfect theory craft conditions, yeah. I said I was wrong there
---
Pretty much.  I ran about a 60 people through their Ony quests on my warrior.  No one I helped when I needed to get keyed on my hunter.  Kind of depressing.
---
I was 32 when I first played WoW. Also in Wrath. However shortly after Cataclysm was released and I really didn't like the changes so I stopped.
---
Later I played on Wrath private servers and finally on a Vanilla private server. I liked what I've seen and I can't wait to play Classic. :)
---
Yeah less memes so we can have the millionth thread about mc legendary or people asking for prot pally changes.

---
(disclaimer - I love Lightning Reflex hunter. I usually play it whenever I play a hunter regardless of whether it is correct for min/maxing)
---
Anyways, in that scenario, it would be correct to use BSH yeah. BSH gives 66AP and .62% crit, which ends up being about a .2-.3% DPS increase - (depending on how much AP you have) - over Dal'rends' 50ap/1crit. 
---
That said, the spec choice would probably be wrong for min/maxing for these following reasons: 
---
If the weapon choices you're looking at are Dal'rends or BSH, then your gear level probably is low enough that going Lightning Reflexes is worse than going Marksman. 100 AP, 15% multi shot damage and 5% flat ranged damage are very potent and take some time before Lightning Reflexes is a DPS increase. Pre-raid BiS hunters also wore several pieces of gear that had no agility on them (Devilsaur, Truestrike, Blackstone Ring, Painweaver Band, Mark of Fordring, Crown of Tyranny/The Unforgiven mask thing).
---
That being said, LR is fun because you get to see more crits so if I end up making a hunter again it will be LR because crits.
---
The answer we need but not deserve. Thanks!
---
The existence of addons and Blizzard’s energetic support for them is one of the most important elements in the overall success of WoW.
---
Herr der Ringe!
---
I find that frost mage overcomes pushback well enough with its control tools. There are classes that have it worse. Warlock has nothing to protect against it besides channeled spells, and elemental shamans only get Eye of the Storm which is gonna be worse in Classic because /sit doesn't work. That came in TBC, but private servers tend to have it in vanilla for whatever reason. I don't think it's necessary to list this as a class weakness for mages. They have the mobility and control to live with it. A lot of shamans are gonna be in for a disappointing surprise when they find that you don't proc EotS while sitting and will have to take several hits trying to get a few seconds of pushback protection. Warlocks at least have a lot of instant casts.

"*Hmmm, both vanish and prep are on CD, do I wait the extra 2 minutes for vanish to refresh and continue pick pocketing after, or risk the 5 minute death walk back to BRD if this goddamn dwarf resists*"
---
Are you telling me consequences give variance in gameplay?
---
Even when WoW was it it's peak, after TBC I feel that a lot of the original playerbase was getting bored of WoW. People were *looking* for a WoW killer. Yes, classic WoW will always have it's core playerbase, but for the majority, they were just looking for another game that wasn't WoW. Blizzard tried to "listen" to the community but what they didn't take into consideration I think is that a large portion was just done with WoW either way. Whether for a break or just permanently. Instead of trying to keep their core playerbase and being happy with that, they tried to keep the people that were leaving and ended up losing most of both.

I still get under 1.0mbp/s :^) 
---
End my suffering.
---
Ok, guess mine was 4 CD's.  It's kind of 3 hours away at my parents place, I may not have looked at it in a while.
---
Anyone seen rexxar? 
---
He's in bed with yo momma. 
---
Come on guys, anyone seen him?
---
He's over by..... 
---
yo momma.
---
Hey hey hey. All of those groups can also be stoners now, it’s 2019 don’t assume my vice.
---
Alchemy is not needed to use potions, waste of profession slot unless you are making flasks for guild or something.
---
No, it was just pretty rare in vanilla.
---
That's a rookie mistake. Twinks will get most their gear way before 19 and you can easily plan a route and disocver things before 19 to make sure.
---
I was the leader of Onslaught on Akama!  It was started by a group of us who were from Tichondrius and wanted to reroll horde and peruse rank 14!  What was your character name? ;)
---
I just meant the Leo type, from that 70's show lol.
---
Yeet, or be Yeeten
---
*Bones for the Bone throne*
---
*Blood for the Blood God!*
---
This is just the beginning, you didn't loose your job ... yet :o
---
It is for lvling since you'll have downtime, as long as you've got a slow weapon.
---
I was in several, but &lt;Onslaught&gt; on Akama will always be my baby.
---
Horde side server firsts through BWL, total control of the flow of Rank 14s and never once lost an Arathi Basin! ;)
---
Well one of the main problems WoW had was there were no raid frames.   It’s really hard to heal a 40 man with only being able to see your parties health.
---
I was in my last year of high school, first year of college. Dangerous combo. I'm amazed I didn't flunk out.
---
And consumables should be helpful too?
---
Best mindset!
---
Kingdom Come: Deliverance
---
Kek, that's understandable. Still have it in my old room as well, back home.
---
Never had much issues as a warlock. You won't need the fast majority of your skills for every encounter/situation. At least in PvE it was easily managable. PvP will use a few more as some skills can be used against specific classes.  Can't comment on shaman  though.
---
Sounds like Heresey, better call in the level 60 Inquisitors and purge everything.
---
"Also this is an era where people straight up murder and rape one another without much (sometimes no) social stigma whatsoever."
---
Lol ok
---
Nope, but I will roll on an RP-PvP one if possible. I’m not into RP or anything, but the last time I played retail they used to have a rather balanced population and tons of WPvP drama which I loved.
---
So technically it should be better to level in a group so you get less exp and can do more level appropriate quests
---
Just did it and it worked. Thanks so much!
---
Or else they'd be called adless and that's just lame man.
---
Your post is pretty ironic if you think of it
---
&gt; I think it should be acceptable to be open and honest that a lot of people have tried them out, as long as we’re not actively pushing anything by name.
---
that's how it works now. You just have to avoid naming one specific server. You can say "I experienced that on one of the private servers", but avoid advertising/giving hints of any server. Guess it's because Blizzard has been lately aggressive with legal actions.
---
On the other hand, I got my posts removed by moderators themselves. I have no idea why, they even had upvotes. Examples are a post about the "World of Warcraft credit card" - appearently because it wasn't in the form of a caption meme. Someone else made a post about the exact same thing, but included a caption meme photo, and made it to the top.
---
And, I also got a 7-day ban for that post, by the way, and they said the reason was "having too many removes". Good to know, I'm being banned for moderators' actions.
---
Also, I posted a screenshot from another game, that allows player-made content and player-made servers - and one server had a long quest chain that was basically copy-pasted from the human starting zone (Northshire) - only with different place names. I posted a screenshot here, got 5 votes almost instantly, then a notification that it has been because "content must be related to WOW Classic". I appealed, I said that the quest was basically copy-pasted - and as a response I got a rude "but how is it related to WOW Classic, it's a screenshot from another game!"
---
Another time, I posted a screenshot from the WOW's launcher. It had a WotLK logo, but it was still the old launcher, the same that was used on 1.12. And, it got removed, and as the reason, some moderator came up with a completely fresh rule, that's not even listed. Something like that:
---
&gt; Low quality memes - googleable pictures posted straight into reddit, count as low-quality memes. If you want to post them, you have to at least put captions on the picture
---
I guess that was just a rude way to talk about copyright?
---
Anyway. Seems like the moderators feel like they "have power", and click the button "ban" instead of "downvote".
---
Gnomish Death Ray is great for rogues. Cheap shot, swing away for the duration, kidney shot, start channelling the trinket. I believe it uses your physical crit chance as well and will often one-shot people. Some of the pets can be useful against casters too, but they probably wouldn't be better than the Barov Caller or whatever it's called.
---
I always installed the expansions via disk when they came out all the way to Cata, great times.
---
Start at 10:27 instead. It was indeed Ion that that argumented for it being impossible. The IRC convo is between Alex Afrasiabi on blizzards side and someone from death and taxes. The GM of Death and Taxes (blue name in irc) paraphrased a rage post Alex did back when he was leader of the most dominant everquest guild. Red text, Furor, is Alex Afrasiabi.
---
Is this guy really trying to compare map hacking wtih atlas loot...
---
Anything. If it has buffs, remove them.
---
Not 100% sure but I've had $20 on my account for like a year so I don't think it matters.
---
Goes to show you race selection is marginal in reality. Play what feels right :).
---
Oh shit my bad
---
Yes https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150 enjoy!
---
NO. You think you will, but you won't.
---
First, patch 2.4, then 2.4.1, then 2.4.3. It will be about 6 hours.

Dude start walking peoples dogs so you can buy a secondhand treadmill and then you can walk and play.

*VC - Boss of Deadmines, instance in Westfall. Sometimes used interchangably with Deadmines (i.e. LFG VC is the same as LFG Deadmines)*

Oh look.

It was 85 in Orlando yesterday. All signs point to summer.
---
Wow I completely forgot about Wow Insider, I used to love that show! Listening to an episode now, thanks so much for posting these.
---
Just now? It's been like this for months.
---
I'm a complete noob when it comes to Vanilla WoW. I thought this was going to be a thread about dropping food on the ground.
---
Blurred out something that was more acceptable (well, less unacceptable) to have in an addon in 2006 than in 2019.
---
Only if there’s rp-pvp, some of the most fun I’ve had on this game has been on a rp-pvp server.
---
I hear you, and it makes totally Sense to me. Maybe if we Start to look from a different perspective, i remember the Start of APEX. In a world where the market was flooted by Battle Royales, they didn‘t have any marketing before release. It just was a livestream announcement and boom The game was playable. Now it has millions of gamers still. I know, i know WoW is not a BR, but the MMO community is waiting long for something new, so even if blizz does the no-advertising-strategy, WoW Classic will get a big hype on release. 
---
That‘s why i think, that they haven‘t mentioned a release date yet
---
maybe he meant magma totem
---
I deleted this post now  because people took almsot everything I said the wrong way.
---
Our relationship doesn't have any issues over Classic WoW and for all the sexist people out there, we're a gay male couple. So keep your sexist shit to yourself. Thanks bye.
---
Maybe spend less time on /r/classicwow and just visit it when the game's released? That's not logical at all, I know, but it'd save you the headache of re-reading the same topics all over and having to sigh whenever these self-proclaimed Youtube wizards make yet another terrible video about... nothing.
---
Why wouldn't you just link it to the time you want? lol
---
I remember alot, but a good bit of tbc and wotlk bleeds into it, been playing on a few pservers and I had really forgotten how big of a deal gear is, and just how mana hungry EVERYTHING is as a fresh 60
---
This is awesome!
---
Mine always showed yellow dot, and "Peer-to-peer transfer is disabled". At least the later ones, when I got a "new, better" router from my ISP, that would isntantly slow down to 0KB/s once I got into P2P

---
I think it has something to do with the prevalence of user created content in SCBW and WC3. So they wanted the players to be able to fiddle with their UI and other stuff. Bear in mind they did ban quite a few addons during vanilla and onwards, so not everything was allowed. 
---
Imo Decursive and the likes should really be banned because it trivialises so many mechanics in vanilla. So to preserve some challenge it would be better to get rid of it.
---
Can't be killed by Alliance even on PvP servers (unless you flag yourself) so if you die it is 100% your fault!
---
swifty was shit back then and will be shit on classic servers too
---
Well I watched the video when it first came out and only remembered the conversation of the gm.
---
"Cloudy Day"
---
Gul'dan - Horde
---
Please, know what you're talking about.
---
The debuff slot is directly tied to how difficult some of the boss fights where back then. You remove the debuff limit and suddenly the boss fights are changed. Just imagine Onyxia stage 2 with no debuff limit.
---
It baffles me that people still dont understand this.
---
yes.......1 rez per 30 minutes.
---
Because a handful of pleas have no assets they could lose in a liability lawsuit. 
---
Blizzard offices in Seoul were raided in 04-05 because blizzard couldn’t get the game running so that people could use the product they purchased. 
---
Being a pirate results in a C&amp;D letter. Being a registered for profit company comes with a host of risks. 
---
To that end, 1.12 on old server architecture is woefully out of date and under equipped to deal with the malicious attacks a game like wow attracts. The methods of breaking the game that worked in 2006 have been removed. Bringing that same code from 2006 back opens you up to all those previously shut backdoors.
---
Think of it like weapons. A m4 Sherman tank worked fine in ww2, but in those interceding decades the enemy has made improvements that would kill a Sherman, so we responded in kind with new technology. While a Sherman is still a tank, and can eat up infantry, a modern enemy tank destroys it. 
---
The Sherman is the game server, enemy is a hacker, and infantry is our free time. 
---
Blizzard also has to consider their bottom line. They have an immense infrastructure in the form of battlenet. Having to implement an entirely new server network to accommodate wow classic is expensive. Labor to make the old game agree with new backend is cheaper.
---
Of course they can but warriors would rather go ashlhandi or BRE for PvP. Sulfuras is a huge gold grind so most warriors are fine with it.
---
It's because the LUA was open for developers from day 1. The game was designed to be customisable and it was quite a revolution. No other MMO before this ever handled it this way.
---
Absolutely not impossible on pservers. I did it as soon as I was whatever level strigid owls are (10? 12?) on a certain 8k+ population private server. I followed a guide I found online. I can't remember where I found it, and I haven't logged into that server since the blizzcon announcement. But it definitely is doable.
---
I'm pretty sure it was  [this guide](https://deathraygames.com/articles/walkthroughs/wow-horde-owl/) which somebody already linked. But like you I think I kept rezzing automatically when zoning into Teldrassil on the boat. I followed the path in the guide, jumping off the boat before hitting the docks and using my pet as a distraction and did make it through the portal.
---
Once you die in Darnassus you should rez at Dolanaar.
---
It's definitely not impossible. Just difficult, and probably involves some measure of luck.
---
Elian Gonzalez, that’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time

lol like it isn't obvious what the short word in between "tentacle" and "party" is. Unless I've just watched too much hentai...

Had the market for thorium to myself for a few months.

I remember being apart of two AQ40 openings. One on my main alliance realm and rerolled horde on another newly launched realms and witnessed it again. 
---
I remember how old sunken temple worked but oddly not the order you’re supposed to activate the light pedestal things.
---
Positioning

Haha! Same! Also loved to open the box and watch the amazing Shiny Giant Yeti scene
---
I follow [Joanasworld.com](https://Joanasworld.com) no matter what speed I'm leveling.
---
Yeah, when I quit I was just looking for something else, and not even an MMO honestly. I was just burned out on WoW and the MMO genre at the time. However, when I tried to play it again in WoD/Legion, it just wasn't the same and I only lasted a few weeks. Hell, I was upset that my Ivory Raptor had a cheap knockoff introduced too, making it feel less unique/awesome.
---
As for Asmongold and other big WoW streamers like Soda, they often say they would prefer Classic over current and would even play on private servers if they weren't worried about Blizzard ruining their careers. And I think your right about the current base too, it most likely exist of players who never played vanilla.
---
That’s really really a good comparison... and quite a poetic way to describe it... 
---
I remember flight path locations and pack locations/patrols in stratholme (yes eye of naxxramas, I know where you are, fuckers!). I remember the start of certain bosses (Thaddius, c’thun...) I remember some best in slots items for druids (a shame I’ll be rolling warrior this time).
---
But still, I’m pretty sure I’ll rediscover some things with a certain nostalgia (oh right/damn effect)
---
It'll be awesome for the first couple days, but once alliance get high enough level to just gank the shit out of everyone it's gonna suuuuck.
---
I have few memories of vanilla. I remember playing a druid and throwing talent points everywhere. We were in a WC run and got boosted by a warrior who trained his weapon skill. His main weapon was the AV mace though. Very cool to see someone else with epic gear.
---
My other memory is playing a priest and trying to sell the chest piece from the last boss in SFK. Only to find out it's "soulbound".. what? It can't be traded? Damn it!
---
this thread....*AGAIN*
---
I remember buying shadowfang for 140 gold and thinking it was a bargain.
---
Lol That German version of Lotro😂😂
---
Great work Jakabov, this is the kind of thing we really need. Maybe we can write something about weighting the racials against eachother since there seems to be a good amount of interest on why certain racials can be better in niche and specific situations and the numbers behind it explained.
---
&gt;  It actually helped me beat Princess in Lakeshire :D
---
Unless you stood beside your pet and melee attacked Bellygrub, that enchant kinda didn't help.
---
Sorry, but /b defeated the game a long time ago.
---
I like to think I remember well. I remember risk and reward, and disappointment, and elation. I'm certain I didn't take easy leveling routes. I remember looking up Joana's guides but I never stuck with them. I liked to get distracted. Go on a dungeon bender with guildies, farm this or that. With the Advent of private servers the last few years, people will know more than they knew back then. You'll have completionists and level races and the like, but you'll still have a world of new people, and people who want to do it all the same way again - quest to quest, zone to zone. It can never be the same with 15 years of WoW having passed. I think it'll be bittersweet. Nostalgia is never really all it's chalked up to be when you have a chance to actually relive it. But I also think that if you acknowledge that, you can find new ways to enjoy content that you didn't think possible before, or just never experienced the first time around. This sub is in that "hyped but worried" period of prerelease. You have explored every nook and cranny of possibility that you start to ask what ifs. It's natural.  I will certainly get that familiar grin you get when something you've forgotten comes rushing back like you always remembered it..a quest giver, or a novelty item long discontinued. That's what I look forward to.

CS1.6 source on a DVD... reminds me of that old good linux/debian
---
On the other hand, "Guild Wars Factions"... just Factions... and having its own CD...
---
I will be the troll/undead good guy! (Race decision pending)
---
Guild bank, nothing else. 
---
Why 3 for soul shards, why 500 for ammo? Is that what it was in wrath or something? Those actually effect the game, economy, and player leveling speed though, so I would say no. 
---
Guild bank just discourages account sharing and allows a GM / officer to be somewhat accountable for what happens with the gbank while letting people pull stuff out without having someone with access to the GM's account.
---
Dead by daylight, and divinity orginal sin 2 have been my main time wasters. Those and lurking around here XD
---
At least it's not private server morons advocating for changes to the game like realm caps.
---
I'd prefer a sub that is mostly memes with some serious posts than what r/wow currently is, with just fucking drawings everywhere. That shit is truly awful.
---
Not sure as if you focus on a reputation, you’ll be reputation starved quite early. From my experience/guessing, you cannot go higher than mid revered even if you do all the quest of a specific faction... maybe pvp can help?
---
It won't happen. You say TBC is the bestest thing omg ever liek!!1 But Jimmy, (who was 12 at the time WotLK was released) says that WotLK is *his* favourity expansion. It had DEATH KNIGHTS!!1, after all. So Blizzard would also release WotLK Classic at some point. And where does it end? BfA? Then why not play BfA?
---
&gt; Doesn't exactly seem like a viable option for the masses, which is what we are talking about isn't it?
---
ohh my bad, I thought we were discussing hardcore individuals, yeah sure the masses can do whatever they want.
---
You can use Your kids to keep up Your proffesions when you are at work
---
The combat mechanics changes in bc are arguably the best part. 
---
Different spec peak at different times in terms of usefulness and fun to play. I’d argue most of the good times for most classes was sometime between bc-mop. 
---
I’m all for not nerfing leveling, no lfr, lfd. No welfare epics no dailies, no flying. 
---
But expansions after vanilla made those features integral to the game. Imagine wrath or bc with no welfare epics or daily quests. Imagine Storm Peaks or anagrams without flying? They just don’t work anymore.
---
The real answer beyond running the pre cata world over and over—is for blizzard to make changes to retail that reflect the design principles of vanilla and takes into consideration the concrete improvements made in the vein of that vision over the last 15 years.
---
You can heal up to AQ20/40 as a Shadow Priest and even then, now we know everything about the instance you could probably heal it as a Shadow Priest. A 20/31 Holy isn't terrible in PvP too - you just don't do anything about from shield/dot and heal. Source - me in Vanilla.
---
Your experience with games and mmo's in general had more to do with it. I was 20 when Vanilla came out and what blew me away was the sheer size of the game. I had no idea a game like existed, let alone even be possible.
---
And once  you immerse your self into a game that large when never experiencing anything like it before, age doesn't matter.
---
Sea of Thieves, lovely casual game with a Great community
---
Shrek 2? Score!
---
Back in the day in Runescape if you died anyone could loot the shit you dropped except the three most valuable items, which you kept. That game used to have serious death consequences.
---
You deliver peoples stuffs, you make people happy. You are happiness, be happy. I'm sorry I made you sad internet stranger. I type without thinking.
---
Certainly helpful, but maybe not worth it unless you are going for efficiency. Keep potions around for "oh shit" moments, but consumables are going to be pretty rare in the first month or so while the economy shapes itself.
---
&lt;Apocalyptic Order&gt; on Silvermoon.  &lt;Nexus&gt; for a bit too.  Can't remember the others as I moved around a handful of times through wotlk.  If you remember Cammando/Camm or Element, what's up.
---
Someone made the point "you can still turn on PVP".
---
Real war doesn't have pvp toggles though (unless you count ceasefires).
---
A lot of people underestimating how packed the Barrens, Westfall. Loch Modan, etc are going to be. They are alliance/horde exclusive zones and should be sharded as well. You don't want to completely kill the hype of the casuals that reach level 12 then possibly quit because you cant even kill a plain strider with the 2,000 people in Barrens. 
---
On topic it really depends on the release date, hopefully it's a Saturday or Friday night launch.
---
I mean, TV shows "bleep" words when we know what they mean. Same thing. /shrug
---
is greencard included?
---
if not, give me one. You owe me. For spamming a subreddit I read.
---
Plaguehand was an officer and did a lot regarding organization of raids, calling wipes, etc.
---
Apex, fifa 19
---
My 19 rogue twink was so far into 19, that when the stormwind docks came out, discovering them put me to 20. Luckily they were able to lower my character back to 19 lol
---
Horde has to play against fear ward and another class that can spam dispel fear though.
---
As long as you got crits and spec'd into elemental fury, the burst was there if you had the gear. I remember towards the end, elemental shaman was one of the few classes that could actually kill a geared up holy paladin.
---
If you're feeling friendly, would you send me that. I'd love to look it over (though my profs would be different).
---
Don't share PvP videos, the elitists HATE it.
---
Keybinds are usually for PvP, especially when it comes to warlocks. Never played a shaman so I can only tell you about warlocks.    
---
In raids you will mostly use a curse, corruption, lifetap and shadowbolt. I would also bind fear, death coil and Limited Invulnerability Potion (if you pull aggro). A tip is to bind Shadowbolt to your mousewheel, not only does it free up a slot but it also just feels really nice to just roll the wheel and fire shadowbolts.
---
If you PvP though.. oh boy, you need just about every spell keybound and sometimes different ranks as well and macros, engineering gadgets and so on. I bought a G600 mouse just to play Warlock well in PvP.
---
Grab your sword and fight the horde
---
what if I had a level 60 character in 2004, but made a new account on EU once it opened, and never got level 60 there?
---
Has it been confirmed that we'll need the full retail client to play Classic? Like, is it worth downloading it now and just having it sitting, waiting for release? I'm not gonna pay for it yet, but maybe I'll level a character to 20 for free or something.
---
Of course I'd rather not have a 50gig client for a game that's significantly smaller, but if that's the way then so be it.
---
Unfortunately no.
---
Great answer thank you!
---
favourite\*
---
I think it could work fairly well playing as a shammy tank in PvP.
---
That’s probably when 8.2 will drop.
---
&gt; I remember playing WoD and through most of it I was Alliance and I loved the Garrison. But then I race changed horde and it was miserable.
---
Understandable, the Horde got absolutely shafted with Garrisons.
---
Late to the thread, but it's 151 days till fall (Sept 23rd). For some reason Google search only counts to Sept 1st. 
---
So we're good!
---
Or things like Karazhan that were supposed to be in Classic
---
As a spriest it’s easy to get blown up but if u wand the totems, fear, and silence heal they will go down. That was during leveling/fresh 60 gear. I don’t know about later gear fights
---
Will also be playing Imperator:Rome for a few weeks.
---
The Nostalrius server is under a license, so Blizzard can't use it.
---
The slippery slope fallacy is well known, and it's a fallacy for a reason. However, when it comes to world of warcraft it's proven to be dangerous. Every small QoL always seems to lead to more, because people get more and more comfortable and want more and more comfort.
---
Keep Classic as it is. Warts and all.
---
My fond memory of classic was playing a tauren druid in a roleplaying guild on emerald dream. I love the fantasy, like you. I like tauren because the tauren are a nomadic and close to the earth civilization and that fits druids well. Night elves are a little more otherworldly, imo. I liked tauren because they are hunters also, and that fit well with my cat druid spec.
---
Yeah I feel like hardcore players will always go the extra mile but then the next question becomes why not take a fury warrior or rogue instead I guess? Idk. I honestly don't even care that much, don't know why I kept harping on about it. Guess that's what happens when your in bed sick. Would be interesting seeing how well a good feral player keeps up with a totem twisting shaman.
---
I mean EQ had like 20 expansions so you definitely can, I doubt it's a good idea though.
---
Lying to your wife about “working late”.... I see this panning out well. Be there for your kids man.
---
You know I mean in the show, right?
---
I have played WoW since late TBC and always have been an altoholic. Recently I've tried all classes on p-servers, had fun with all of them, but spent most time tinkering with rogue. There's just something stupidly fun about how many ways I can play rogue, be it burst with ambushes, multiple stuns, adrenaline rush, cold blood combos, double vanish with prep...  
---
My concern being the overpopulation of the class. It is said to be one of the best PvE dps, one of the best PvP classes. How much of a hassle is it to get into groups on 60? I made it to 56 on a p-server and never struggled and only a few times was in a dungeon group with another rogue. Cheers!
---
It was seen as an innovation over stuff like EverQuest which only allowed you customize the UI through XML.
---
A lot of people see it as a mistake nowadays though, and you see newer MMOs listing "no addons" as a selling point.
---
Like a lot of things it comes down to player preference. I personally wish WoW didn't have addons, but it is what it is.
---
Tell that to everyone in new england!
---
I remember far too much. It's eerie at times. Like locations of quest items for a quest I did twice 12 years ago. I've often complained to my friends that if I could remember programming syntax as well as wow macro commands I'd be a millionaire.
---
Front loaded damage.  Lots of potential for the second half, but most scrubs are casters or resto.  So dont worry too much.
---
Ah I've always heard about The Instance from listening to BluePlz but I've never actually heard their episodes. This will be interesting!
---
I'm not stopping at Ashkandi, gimmie that Ashbringer
---
A Druid on Lothar gave me 40 gold to help with my epic riding. Tried to pay him back like a month later and he closed the trade and gave me the ;-) face.
---
This is so true.
---
Better game is a questionable statement, but better, more complicated and philosophical story for sure.
---
I own a copy of the wow atlas and a copy of the wow dungeon guide.
---
My favourite part of the dungeon guide is that for every dungeon it has a suggested party composition that includes a tank, healer, and some DPS. THANKS FOR THE TIP!
---
I am an elf.
---
For Elves, 13 years old counts as adult.
---
Well, 130, but I always remove the last digit to satisfy filthy humans asking for my age.
---
Now, I'm 23. That's 10 years of adulthood. Like 28 for humans.
---
And some people say I look 16, while others say I look 28.
---
If you have ever owned Wow, at all, ever, you own Classic Wow. HOWEVER, it will still require an active sub.
---
That being said, the same sub can be used for the current game and classic simultaneously, you wont need two separate subscriptions.
---
Addon &gt; hack

I started at European release, played for a month but never got past Barrens with any character. I returned a few months later and made a Warrior that reached rank12, exalted AV+WSG+AB and cleared MC/ZG + parts of BWL/AQ20 with, never got past the first boss in AQ40. All that happen in a 6 month span, I never got any alts above level 30 and quit before Naxx was released and didn't return during early TBC.
---
I was something like 26 when I first started Vanilla, yet there's a lot I forgot.
---
I found some screenshots of my alt troll priest at MC, yet I could have swore that I only raided with my warrior and no other alt.
---
There's another one : a guild invite on my orc rogue were the 4 guys kneel in front of me, I absolutely don't remember this guild at all (and I have several screenshots of me running instances with them !).
---
Oooooh boy, Magic the Gathering: Battlegrounds! I fucking loved that game back then!
---
thats ridiculous, potentially losing all your gear in 7 days
---
You also lost 10 percent of your level. Which in your 50’s was a few hours of hard grinding. Only certain caster classes could cast bind affinity to set a new spot to spawn when you die. And only certain spots were appropriate bind spots. It was a lovely horrible nostalgic pain in the ass.
---
My dream is that they release the burning crusade but don't have the hellfire peninsula quest gear be better than raid gear, and they don't implement flying. Without those two mistakes wow would be a much healthier game.
---
Having gear scale the way it did basically created a situation where expansions completely disconnected you from the previous world and gameplay. And having flying mounts meant you could effectively 'check out' from the world at any point in time.
---
Could replace fresh 60 with any level and gearing with guild to le eling to 60 and you've described me perfectly.
---
The Division 2.  It's such a badass game.  Just hit wt1 and having a blast.  I don't plan on playing any other game until classic, even canceled my retail sub for now because it just isn't fun anymore.
---
 And yardwork....so much yardwork.  The weeds took over my yard during the winter so I have to murder it all.  It's more fun than I can stand.  I have a thistle that's 6 feet tall!  It's kinda like a turn based rts.  You vs. the hoards of weeds...
---
Also hoping neongenesis evangelion drops on netflix before classic so I can binge it properly.  Because of it's release date it'll most likely be the last fun thing I do before classic.  Not a game but it's a very significant event.
---
Should probably start getting healthy again too.  You know so I don't die during a 52 hour classic grind session.  That should be real fun.  Your health isn't a game but you can think of exercise and eating healthy as a mini game or something.  Boost your irl stats so you can be successful in classic.
---
Netherwing TBC pserver :)
---
I was able to do it at lvl 12. but be prepared to die a lot.
---
That right there is the seed in the back of my head. The thing giving me dread.
---
I know I’ll be head over heels addicted. My retail main has 500 days. And I Haven’t played seriously since mop. And that doesn’t consider retail alt or pservers.
---
But ya, I’ll probably spend &gt;200 days in vanilla. Feelsbadbutgoodman.
---
Dark Souls 3. 
---
But... I hate the fact that I got stuck in some cathedral, and I have no idea where to go. I feel like I've explored everything, except for the DLCs.
---
But still. Even though it's a single player game (soloing monsters), but it has an online mode, where, if you're lucky, you can find someone to help you. And, there is also a chance that someone will raid you at any time. And, also gear and consumables are meaningful in quite similar way. So, similar feelings.
---
Back in the day my brother played an enhancement shaman and I played a warrior. When we did dungeons I couldn't hold aggro off him single target, so we worked out a system where he 'tanked' the first mob in every pack, and I tanked the other ones. That way he could go ham on damage without me having to fight for aggro. It was a good system.
---
FFXIV is a ton of fun.
---
Then league of legends when I want some pvp
---
Yo yo it's ya boy Mark, aka, Markymark, aka Markyboi aka Markydude
---
Well..perplexty ruined all other rogue videos for me:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM1bSJm6GTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM1bSJm6GTE)
---
I went homeless and jobless back in wotlk because i refused to do anything but play. Hopefully i do better this time lol
---
being a capable tank always willing to run things with people is the best way to help.  saves them the time of finding one which is the true final boss of WoW
---
If my memory serves me you use to be able to get WF procs off WF procs and that would lead to those WTFWFPOWNED moments.  I'm pretty sure they patched that out by 1.12 so we won't see it in Classic.
---
Surely they'll be merging servers if they qualify for one high pop together?
---
I don't see the issue in doing so while most are still levelling to 60, which is going to be at least a month.
---
What? The leveling system is far superior as well as the ability queue.
---
Weapons upgrades and support characters and their weapons and skills are better.
---
Your proposed "solution" has a huge impact on the already existing community though.... Memes, fanart and jokes have always been one of the "Pillars" of this community. 
---
If you don't like this place you can run an equivalent place with your rules and try to promote it as a more serious, detailed discussion alternative subreddit  about Classic WoW and see the demand.
---
Trying to change a community through strict rules rarely ever succeeds.
---
Hardiness is also more reactive then WotF, since most fear effects are used defensively thus using WotF allows you to be on the offense more. Most stuns are used to kill you while fears are used to control. Generally Horde premades tend to be more aggresive in their plays than defensive.
---
As a solo player I would say that Hardiness has WotF beat by a mile though, but if we factor in outside help with things like healing, peeling and the likes I think WotF and keeping the momentum going is more important than having a chance to defend yourself better against kill setups that you might not survive even with a resist on the stun.
---
Roll a druid bro.
---
You can tank, heal, range or melee.
---
More often than not, for lowbies, you'll tank or heal, bit the thing with Druids.  You can do a good job at three of those things, with one spec, yet you still have to farm the gear.  So it's a mini grind on the side.
---
Anything with healing helps. I'd run lowbies through Deadmines and such on my Warlock pretty often, but if one ran off and aggro'd something I couldn't often save them. Druid or Paladin would be pretty self-reliant, and it'd fit the RP of a Paladin doubly so.
---
Why would it be less?  It was 15 back in the day and it’s 15 for current wow.  Be happy you are getting any bonus even if you don’t plan to play current wow ever, plus you don’t have to buy the classic game.  So you technically are saving money
---
“ No problems detected.”
---
I think they enabled WF cooldown on BC, am I wrong here?
---
Enhance is too hard
---
In before scrubs say it isn't viable.
---
Herbalism, and you can also farm solo farm DM E trash. you just won't be able to do the entire instance.
---
I plan on starting as a gnome mage, getting a Lesser Magic Wand (assuming it's the green version) and then heading to the Night Elf area and going every quest I can for the rep. 
---
Then I'll just try and do as many low level quests as possible, even if it's not as efficient as grinding.
---
Paladin or druid. When you can tank or heal you will always be in demand for dungs.
---
Unfortunately, powershifting and farming Crowd Pummelers is how a druid manages to do 70% of a dps warrior's damage instead of 30%. Hybrid tax was a real thing in vanilla, except warriors who were exempted. Vanilla did a lot of things right, but class balance was not one of them. 
---
Ferals scale basically not at all from gear, while warriors scale exponentially. More damage = more rage = more damage. I don't recall feral AP existing before AQ. The reason a raid might bring a Feral druid is that it's easier to gear up a feral and 2 warriors, than it is to gear up 3 warriors for tanking at the same time.
---
Irl and in game!
---
No they enabled it earlier
---
I remember leveling to 60. This time I'm doing everything different and new except for warlock, fishing, and herbalism. This time I'm rolling on pvp server as an undead horde warlock. I've never tried alchemy before. I was never horde in vanilla. I will actually level first aid this time. I will level on a pvp server. I did learn how to quest in the barrens playing the classic demo so I kind of know how to start questing which is nice.
---
Same here!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
---
this man is correct. Multi windfury proc chains were disabled in patch 1.4
---
Elemental shamans do melt people. Enhancement was nerfed pretty early.
---
Also you were in AQ level, shamans t2.5 all gives crit+sp so once the server is progressed to that level, there will be some absolutely insane shamans out there to worry about. AQ40 changes so much with shamans.
---
I feel those are moreso cosmetic changes and bag size changes.  No big deal.  So long as killing shit is still tough.  Cos, you know what the difference is between a bitch, with and 18 slot bag, and a bitch with 12 slot bag?
---
None!   Both are bitches
---
Slippery slope is the most retarded argument and it's spammed on this subreddit like insanity. Change my mind.
---
Also I'm against OP's QoL changes.
---
Well they were super liberal in Warcraft3 so I'm not really surprised that they were in wow.
---
And everything matters more. When you crack 2K dmg on a move, it's a WHOA moment. I saw some BFA footage and 100K moves are being slung around like candy. It's hard to gauge how much of a dent you are making with those inflated numbers.
---
Hemo prep works but it’s not efficient. You basically press hemo instead of sinister strike, and use a couple seconds more to kill a mob. It has huge advantages in pvp though. 
---
All in all a much more fun spec to play if you like pvping while leveling, but not fast. I ran it in an alt I didn’t rush back in the day. You should also go the standard hemo spec (hemo/prep / cold blood)
---
Yeah against my wishes, that's the best course of action..the flaws are just as important as the polish.
---
I’m sure this was bc it was during vanilla but I was an undead warrior and people would inv me then see I’m undead and then boot me back out. 
---
I’m hoping that bc there is so much tribal knowledge now within the community that certain race perks won’t be as big of a deal as before. 
---
But as with what other people said, just play what you want so you have fun.
---
What's funny is after all these years. The Instance is still the only show still going strong. The Instance is definitely not the hard hitting analysis that Blue Plz was. The Instance is a fluffier show. Just laid back talking about what's happening in WOW at the given moment. There was always room for both. I think TB's take no prisoners approach changed over time.
---
I played during that time frame but never got passed mid or low 30s. I came back later and I think I got a shaman into the high 30s. 
---
Then once BC came out I maxed 3 chars in pretty short order...all belfs. Dont hate.
---
I did Gruul and Kara and arena type shit. Didnt start really raising well into Lich King. As soon as I was well geared to MT in lich king I quit WoW and have never spent much time since or even logged in since Panda.
---
BC was the most fun for me because we had a friend group that could clear most of Kara. Going to school and sitting at lunch talking about the upcoming raid was loads of fun.
---
Support the people that was adding malicious scripts into the site? Yeah, I'll get right on that.
---
Art makes up about 6% of all things that are submitted to r/wow. There is definitely not "drawings everywhere" but facts are hard, I guess.
---
For PVE you can do warlock with few keybinds just fine.
---
Other than that, I would very much recommend a mmo mouse.
---
Sure. I talk about this stuff regularly on my stream https://www.twitch.tv/caperfin stop on by would be happy to discuss it further.
---
I've been playing EVE Online since it's really the only MMO left that has a focus on community, until Classic WoW comes out ofc.
---
I'm sure most people wouldn't mind some simple changes (although guild bank is a much bigger change than the other two). The consequences are that no one is going to agree on which small changes are okay which aren't. What people do agree on is that they want Vanilla and that's what Blizzard is going to deliver.
---
Blizzard put it best themselves. The community wants a re-created Vanilla so that's what they're going to give us. Trying to "fix" the problems of a 15 year old video game in a way that will please everyone is a wild goose chase.
---
Might just do that my dude, thanks for the link.
---
Same, it would be a massive help, going to level a priest too :P Let us know if we can give back or something in return :)
---
Quite honestly, I feel this sub has a healthy balance of memes and discussions. They only thing I would mention is maybe the fact that there are too many distasteful jabs at retail WoW. I don’t mind those jabs, if they are clever, but when you just have Drake saying no to retail and yes to WoW Classic, then it’s just like “seriously, why did you even put an EFFORT into this meme?” You may as well replace retail with an apple and Classic with an orange, my reaction would be the same to those, unless you follow it up with something clever, like a joke about the orange being acidic and apple by comparison basic (I know, not the best, but still better than a flat “this is good, this is bad” meme)
---
I’m betting he means well, but his private server isn’t tuned/configured correctly (bonus experience or attack power or something). This subreddit gets mad though if you try to suggest that private servers are not exact duplicates of vanilla wow.
---
I'm abroad for 2 months. My limit on roaming is 5.4GB - after exceeding that, I have to pay 8€ per gigabyte.
---
I already have 2.5GB of that used. Now, to think I have local WiFi most of my time...
---
The Holy Trinity.
---
Good post. I can chime in on how spell penetration and resistances work:
---
Basically you have your level based resistance and your stat resistance. The level based resistance is either 5/*level difference or 8/*level difference. Sources disagree. This resistance can't be removed at all which is why you still get partials when CoS/CoE is up. This is more applicable to raiding ofc but I thought I'd mention it.
---
10 resistance averages at a 2,5% damage reduction on non-binary spells and a 2,5% chance of resist on binary spells. 
---
For the soft caps and that I guess you have to try and look at what you will be facing. In a random pug how many will have resistance gear on? Will they be buffed at all? If they have several priests there might be more shadow resistance flying. If they have more paladins there might be some frost and fire resistance as well. Those buffs are 60 resistance btw which is quite a lot. Lastly, where do you actually get spell pen gear? Usually from AQ40 which means it's raid gear that not everyone can attain.
---
There's literally no need to use a private server's code when they have all of the 1.12 source code intact. Further, they can get certain values exactly correct as they were in 2006, which private servers have had to try to guess, and which many suspect are incorrect and possibly significantly in some cases.
---
Nostalrius and other pservers did a fantastic attempt in my opinion providing an authentic experience and scratching that vanilla itch. I think they did a phenomenal job. But there are some numbers and formulas they've had to guess, and while many feel it's pretty close, there are others who feel some things (like resists, armor, etc) are pretty off. It's hard to know where "the numbers are off and this is easier than it should be" ends and "we have better guides available and we're all better at this game now" begins.
---
The demo showed some potentially significant differences between our memories of vanilla and actual vanilla. Some rares were reported to be doing incorrect damage. Jangolode kobolds were reported to be moving at the wrong speed (too fast I think?). Warlocks were bug reported for pets auto-dismissing as soon as you attempt to summon another instead of being affected by "summoning disorientation" and sitting there stunned until the spell cast was complete. Blizz was able to compare them to actual 1.12 and confirm these specific things were working correctly in the demo, and that the Summoning Disorientation spellID is a 2.0.1 addition.
---
It wasn't my age that had an impact on my vanilla experience, it was my place in life at that time that had an impact on my vanilla experience.
---
Because like it or not, we never just judge a game based on its merits alone. The game means different things to different people, it fills a different role in their lives. People using games as emotional crutches? Happens all the time.
---
Also, I lost the game.
---
Its quickly becoming one of my favorite games ever. Good character variety, with at least 4 more on the way, plenty of unlocks, and some of the most satisfying gameplay I've experience.
---
Yeah, I'm going into a server blind.
---
No friends, no connection.   I am playing this game to make nerd friends.
---
I loved this quest line because it seemed so absurd yet so fitting at the same time. Raptors stealing silver? Why? But animals hoard weird stuff all the time, usually by hiding it under the fridge or behind the dryer.
---
You and I share too many things in common, and I'm convinced you may be my long lost brother.
---
I will be rolling RP. I might consider a RP-PvP, but I did the PvP thing before, will get 60-90 minutes 3-5 nights a week, and really just want to quietly enjoy my game time.
---
Main will be a human warrior, aimed at tanking. I haven’t thought too much on his back story yet. But I generally play the honorable knight or something of that nature.
---
It's the truth wtb all thicc leather 1g
---
After playing tons of Runescape and Ultima Online, simply not losing items on death (and possibly having to retrieve them) is already a luxury. Classic is nice in comparison, durability costs are negligible.
---
The main thing I remember about KOTOR 1 is Manaan and those fish creatures that were annoying to talk to. Like it took them forever to say something in their bullshit language of weird sounds but if you skipped it you end up accidentally skipping over the next line of text.
---
I have nvme and will install it on c:/, 512gb lifr
---
Shaman will be one of the most popular classes on horde this time.
---
This is good, and very helpful. 
---
I agree that most info on vanilla is about strictly pve. In a lot of discussions especially here on this reddit, I notice people commenting pve responses to pvp questions. You can’t use the same mindset for pvp as you do for pve.
---
I played a rogue exclusively through vanilla through BWL, and quite a bit of PvP.
---
&gt;There's just something stupidly fun about how many ways I can play rogue
---
First of all when it comes to classic, I always suggest you play the class with the play style you like best, because you're going to invest a ton of time into it. Picking a fury warrior over a rogue because you think they're better DPS when you prefer a rogue kit would be silly in vanilla.
---
There will be times when you'll see LF2M UBRS DPS, only to be told they have enough rogues, but I wouldn't say its a huge hassle. You may have to occasionally ask multiple groups, or start your own group. Raids you'll be able to get into, but you'll be competing with many other rogues for gear.
---
They are strong in ganking and 1v1 PvP. With very strong cooldowns, burst, and the ability to take advantage with stealth, you can nuke a lot of people in 1v1 or by ganking them as they travel to BRM. Dueling outside of your major city is fun with rogues. 
---
However in group PvP, you aren't all that strong, and good hunters and warriors LOVE to switch to you immediately and burst you down because of your squishy leather. You'll find yourself without your cool downs often which is also frustrating. Most success I've had in organized, group PvP was by playing more of a support role, basically body guarding healers, and jumping on people who jumped on our healers thinking they'd be getting a 1v1. Being a back-line assassin didn't really work as the opposing team calls you out, you get switched on hard, you're out of position, and healers can't keep you up like they could a warrior.
---
When I clicked the link, I thought it was going to be a queue timer.
---
I guess that’s true. I’m a greedy bastard so don’t worry about it.
---
We can't turn off our brains, we can't forget what we already know. It will take more effort to have it feel like an organic experience. You get to decide if you socialize now as much as you socialized back then while you are leveling.
---
Do you right click and inspect that deadmines group before you join up with them? Or do you just go with them, because past you wouldn't have known any better in 2004 and wiping over and over again was a different experience back then then it will be now.
---
Ya right now this is no better than just browsing Youtube.
---
I do love the pally, and I've heard they're pretty good in 5 mans. I know they're bottom tier for raids, but if I never do much raiding it wont matter. Is druid or pally better for AoE? It seems like AoE is what you want for lower level dungeon runs to keep stuff off of the lowbies.
---
Sadly this isn’t my guild, but remember when world bosses could come to towns? Good times.
---
Nothing like watching a giant dragon tear up Orgrimmar to Christmas music, thanks Alliance.
---
I don’t think so. It’ll definitely be more played but definitely not over Warrior/Rogue/Mage/Hunter
---
Why do you care?
---
I started a pally, took her to 60. Then when the guild needed a dwarf priest to raid, I re-rolled and leveled one. Before BC started, I had also leveled a hunter to 60.
---
I may have had too much free time.
---
My friend begged me for so long to try it out, every day just at me telling me how great it was. I was already addicted to Runescape so I didn't have time for another game. After about a month of constantl earache I finally gave in and downloaded the client on my shitty dial up connection, made my account and chose to be an orc (I can't remember what class or whatever).
---
I was killing boars and wondering what I was doing with my life, alt tabbing out to get on MSN to talk to the friend who dragged me in to this shit. I vaguely described where I was for a long time, not understanding how to find out where I was, or anything else for that matter.
---
Then over a hill they jumped down on their mount, thinking they were the absolute tits and that I would be so impressed with them. I didn't know what was going on, let alone being impressed by gear I knew nothing about or how hard it was to get etc.
---
Anyway, off we went together, doing nooby stuff and them trying to get me to enjoy myself despite me wanting to hate the game so I could get back to Runescape, where I belonged.
---
Eventually, we climbed up a hill and I fell down, I got glitched into a mountain and couldn't do anything. I'd had enough and rage quit, I uninstalled the client and told my friend over MSN that WoW is shit and whatever and I won't be logging back on.
---
Then I went back to Runescape.
---
But for the past couple of years I've been seriously interested in gaming history, MMOs in particular. I've read a lot about this game and it's history, the players and community. There's a serious amount of passion for this game, especially when nostalgia is involved.
---
I actually can't wait for Classic to come out so I can play, knowing what I know now about MMOs and how they work. Seeing the hype and nostalgia for this game and the way the players are waiting for it is getting me more hyped for this game than I have been about a game in a long time.
---
Dude, I completely understand what you mean. Not just here but the entire internet. I've been using the net since 1998 and watching it slowly change into constant shitty pop culture memes is really lame.
---
I miss forums! Smaller communities were really cool like that. It's a shame that social media kind of took over.
---
&gt; Trying to change a community through strict rules rarely ever succeeds.
---
Actually, it would succeed pretty quickly, if the moderators actually wanted to do so. There are moderation bots that can delete any posts that are just links to images.
---
What is so creepy about a dude pursuing a woman?
---
Yeah the super cheap bags and small silver donations for skill training don't grab too much from your main at 50+ but make a huge QoL improvement for any alts.
---
Just stay away from the AH and buying greens for them alts!
---
I'm using UBlock Origin as well and NoScript to stop those scripts running. I'm also behind a VPN so I'm well protected but still.. it doesn't make the site any good when you need so much stuff just to safely scroll the damn site.
---
I would use ClassicDB but they use p-server data. Do they have any plans to switch to Classic data after the game is out or will they stay as a p-server database?
---
I was in Ninja Pirates From Space, a guild that was first on Laughing Skull, then moved to Andorhal.  It's funny to think back on it, I was the hunter officer.  Remember class officers?  Good times....
---
Still among my favorite guild names.
---
N
---
Have you tried any apps made for note-taking, like OneNote?
---
Any one got the original tank spot pod cast. Before they became video?
---
Hooooray for spouting incorrect information!
---
Spreadsheet is fine
---
Thinking about it as I have a shared backstory for my three mains from retail I've played since vanilla. Depends on wether or not my friends will go for it. Definitely not on a PvP server though. I don't want to have to worry about being ganked with the limited playtime I'll have.
---
Honestly, I feel like free low level enchants will usually net you some good money while leveling. No lowbie is gonna pay you for the tiny +hp enchants, but handing them out for free your likely to get some silver in donation! Not to mention it's way fun making someones day by handing out free stuff. Classic is the best!
---
I'll be here when people realize Barrens, Westfall, etc should of been sharded for the first week.
---
Hey I have that! XD
---
My bad, didn’t know it was possible to check statistics like that on Reddit. How do you do so?
---
Every tank will do fine in the dungeons. If you really want to min-max then druid is probably the best tank. Good aoe, good utilities (Faerie Fire, Rebirth, Innervate) and the least gear dependent tank in the game during lvling. If this would be the best gear scenario pally could be better because of the aoe pulls but I wouldn't do that with a group of randoms so I don't know how valuable that is when you want to carry people.
---
When I say aoe pulls I mean stacking at least 2 trash groups.
---
Guild bank would be fine.  None of that other arbitrary bullshit
---
I did some pserver.. got a lvl 30 mage, 15 pld,  15 hunter, and 15 warlock. I've decided on mage so I'm putting this away as to not burn out.
---
I've started playing hollow knight.. I both hate and love it, so I'll continue dying over and over.
---
Nah. Warrior will obviously be the most played, but shaman is right after it in par with mage. This is of course on horde side only. Shaman is incredibly popular, even the biggest polls (n &gt;10k)agree on this
---
JUST RELEASE IT AND FIX IT ON THE WAY!
---
I'm going to play on a RP-PvE server. I'm thinking about making my undead character a polar opposite to numerous edgy undead overlords. It might be fun to play as a lively and kind-hearted (and maybe slightly insane) undead person.
---
lmao, so true.
---
Right, thats having war when it's convenient, which isn't how war is. Plus, you actually make yourself more vulnerable flagged on a PVE server, since not only can you still be attacked by everyone, but people can easily approach you for a good opener.
---
Pserver to test out a classes that I haven't played
---
IIRC the ST things had a trick to them, like it would only highlight the next one in line or something.
---
Retail. I like it as well.
---
I did this last year. Retails not bad but it’s alao got a lot of things an older player may not enjoy. I hate the never ending gear treadmill. At least in the original game and first two expansions it felt like you could get to a point of okay my characters good enough no need to grind stuff daily. Now it’s like at endgame the gear treadmill never stops.
---
Will come back after class
---
Isn't that how D&amp;D works though? I think it makes sense in a campaign, but not so much in an MMO.
---
He also owns a license for winzip and a subscription McAffee Anti-virus.
---
Sorry if it's noobish but I never played vanilla, I always heard tauren was the best race for prot war, what does troll have over tauren?
---
This is the nerf I was thinking of: 
---
1.4 brought the nerf/fix to Windfury:-
---
Windfury - Fixed a bug that caused an additional attack beyond what was intended. In addition, fixed a bug that caused the next normal melee attack to happen sooner than intended.
---
3 second WF cooldown was added in BC along with dual wielding, so it balanced out.
---
There was a part in the PVP section that mentioned that if you kill flightmasters or players/npcs of too low level you would receive a malus that could end up in being unable to enter cities. 
---
For the "new" classic it will be fairly accurate though.
---
&gt; Or, if there's a boss enemy in the open world, it's all avoidable damage as long as you avoid the glowy pools on the ground.
---
This part was the worst, IMO. Especially since it kind of exploded around the time of Wildstar, which felt similar. It's not fun to dodge the cone, avoid the pool, interrupt the spell, IF theres no actual meat to the mob. If it's all just stupidly obvious mechanics, and no ambiguous mechanics, such as high dmg or high health, it's not fun. You're just dancing :/
---
Oh it's absolutely not a deal breaker, but it is definitely worth mentioning. All specs aside from deep frost have easy means of coping with damage pushback (Burning Soul is only 2 points and everything besides deep frost should have it), reduced cooldowns on instant casts (Imp. Fire Blast), more powerful instant casts (various Fire talents) or even another instant cast all together (Blast Wave).
---
In comparison, all Frost has is Improved Arcane Missiles which costs a lot of talent points and isn't exactly ideal in terms of spell schools. You really don't have a lot of options once Ice Barrier drops.
---
I dont know what stack sizes where in Wrath. The numbers comes from what I think would give a QoL boost. But not harm the gameplay in a conciderable way.
---
But i also see the diffrence between them and guild banks. Fair point :)
---
I believe he is using [Vanquisher's Sword](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=10823) main-hand and [
---
Sword of Omen](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=6802) off-hand
---
Can the money be spent on sub time? I remember looking into buying gift cards through Amazon for the cash back on my Amazon card but then I read it could only be used for game purchased not sub time.
---
Yeah, absolutely. Also, I've already done it twice on recent voldemort servers, so I've already experienced the most excruciating form of WPVP, Classic will be a cakewalk in comparison, if the realm populations are accurate.
---
Hi Classic Peeps! I've been working on this for some time and I'm really excited to share my first community tool with you all. I originally wrote this for myself because I suck as making good names, my previous (pre-WoW) names include Kewi (bcos I couldn't spell), Lemon, Melon and other fruit related names.  
---
So hopefully this will help me and others find for a new name in Classic WoW!  
---

---
\# Future Tools  
---
I'm releasing this today and will probably release my "flight master" navigation tool tomorrow (26th April). This will hopefully help navigate the world of Azeroth more efficiently!
---
Just discovered a pserver for PSO: BlueBurst and reliving nostalgia while waiting for nostalgia
---
Sorry man.. not that active here. Just something I would be curious about. But didnt search for the topic. Got any good similar discussion threads to recommend?
---
Yep, thats why my plan is that way. I mean, I don't have to min/max at fuckin' level 5, lol... but having a solid weapon, be it 2h for pally or wand for mage, makes the first bit of leveling SO much easier, when you don't have many spells in your kit to save your ass.
---
Like when they dumbed down macros because you could at one point make a 1-click warlock button for raiding that did all the  decision making for you regarding DOTs and casting SB if I remember correctly.
---
Or when they got rid of the one click Decursive type add-ons that would auto-target raid members that had a debuff and cast cleanse/dispel/decurse/etc as fast as you could click.
---
Hahahaha
---
its wankery 
---
fluff to pad out screenshots to make him look leet
---
you can clear all vanilla combat with the default ui
---
i mean, do what ya feel, but you unnecessarily burden your system with memory intensive UIs and your FPS will suffer with animated unit frames, etc.
---
shrug.
---
i can call wipes
---
everyones dead, its a wipe 
---
Yeah, the original team was very thoughtful about how mechanics affected gameplay. Not to pile-on the modern bad classic good circlejerk, but the modern developers are incapable of looking at WoW through the same lens as the original creators could.
---
I tend to agree that the argument, one change leads to other is kinda weak. Why don't you agree with for example, guild bank?
---
exactly- its completely unnecessary
---
I would say 59s if it was vanilla 1:1 but since they be using 1.12 from start of the game it ain't gonna happen:/
---
Shattered Hand represent!
---
Interesting...
---
Warcraft - DVD
---
Burning Crusade - CD
---
Wrath of the Lich King - DVD
---
Rather surprised at the CD in the middle of the sequence. Would have expected it for Warcraft and have Burning Crusade DVD.
---
I've got some great screencaps from that hellhole.
---
They'll be doing the AQ event when its turn in the phased release comes. I imagine it will be old version before the AQ phase, and new version once AQ phase releases
---
Now THIS is the classic Vanilla experience
---
You man.. you are MVP.
---
WoWCast and Taverncast were great as well
---
Afaik it's not possible in Vanilla. Casting a form while in it breaks it, and you cannot check for the form you no longer have.
---
21 FPS was big boy numbers back in 2006. When my brothers would do 40 mans, they would be lucky to get 10 FPS, staring at the floor :/ Thats one of the biggest things I'm looking forward to with Classic, is some more clarity and less jenkiness, just from the technical side of things.
---
Lmao just fucking have an arms warrior use it, nightfall 'classes' are so fucking dumb when it it still a 70+ dps 2h weapon.
---
poor cuban guy
---
On my parent's dial-up, this would be four days left.
---
It's only really viable if you can twink your gear a bit and level as destro. Then it's by far the fastest way to level, maybe even faster than hunter because you melt mobs so effing fast and you regen while using cooldowns and potions. 
---
Bear in mind also that you are extremely vulnerable to world PvP so unless you're playing on a PvE server I wouldn't bother with it.
---
Those are Prot Paladins.
---
The runbacks were a core part of the experience; it was slightly less cumbersome than EQ in that you didn't lose experience when you died (but your armor has durability), and you didn't have to collect your equipment off your body.
---
I, for one, am looking forward to attempting to run to Scarlet Monastery from Southshore, dying twice, taking a much longer, roundabout way of getting there to avoid guards and people, only to arrive and realize I forgot to buy ammo.
---
TBC pserver
---
Guys almost always do it horribly horribly wrong. T
---
That should be about the least controversial thing I've ever said on reddit. There's no arguing against this point.
---
he real question is, "how do you do it without going horribly horribly wrong?"
---
The answer seems to be that you should be upfront and honest about it and passionate but not overbearing.
---
Buffs didn't scale with recipients level back then. Just being in Goldshire and buffing things as 60 priest is very much appreciated.
---
Or the helpfull mage that ports people around and hands out refreshments + buffs
---
Slay The Spire, I'm completely addicted to it.
---
Tremor and grounding probably need to be one of your most accessible keybinds because you have to use them at very critical short windows of time.
---
I played guild wars for a year before that too, so I had some experience to help. I probably could have gotten to 60 too if I didn't have to share the account with two brothers and my dad :P
---
Guild wars factions. That's the real shit tbh. Respect
---
Assuming getting the attainable gear available from all sources (Naxx, AQ, other less niche items) to remove the 50% and 75% rolls on damage and lower/remove the rolls on cc with 100 resist, how much spell penetration would one need? Spell penetration compared to it's effectiveness sounds really strong if 10 resistance is a 2,5% reduction on average and sounds like it might even outvalue crit.
---
Binary spells are spells that apply an effect right? How do heartbeat resists work out? It would be greatly appreciated if you could share that information with us :)
---
There's a quest to unlearn them. Also, since the BoP items only require a specialisation to craft, you can go gnomish first and craft all the gnomish trinkets and gadgets, then go goblin and you'll still be able to use your gnomish engineering items. 
---
It's hella expensive though, but possible.
---
I made a 39 warlock twink and honestly it wasn't that expensive. I can't remember exactly what my build was, but basically checked the auction house daily for +shadow damage gear and bought whatever I could. A lot of the times it was pretty cheap.
---
Then I just ran an affliction build and dotted up everything with an obscene amount of +shadow damage, and would kill everything.
---
You're essentially a glass cannon so you have to run around with a void walker and sac it whenever you get focused, but I found with a couple dots, sac, and drain life, you could tank long enough to kill someone.
---
Maybe not the best twink out there but I played it a ton.
---
You'd probably have a better time playing in the pvp server before people settle in. When everyone is in the same boat I think itll be more fun.
---
Slapped a classic server onto on old Linux box I have in my office. Something to whet the appetites of myself and a few close friends while we wait for the real thing to be released.
---
Do less crap on your phone, come home and sit at the computer like a real WoW player.
---
Can confirm. Statistically, my own statistics are 100% more accurate.
---
I never understood the advice to leave the game for 15 min when being camped. Why not just spirit Rez and fly to another zone? By the time you land you’ll be almost done with Rez sickness and on your way
---
yea some runbacks in dungeons and outside were quite long, ghosts can fall off tall things
---
Thats when the overwhelming guilt inspires you to look for a warlock in the zone to help summon you back, for 3 of your own hard-earned gold.
---
Repair bill can be a bitch sometimes.
---
I feel like that run back time was part of the reason groups tended to hang together in 5 mans when things weren't going so well back in the day.
---
You had time on the corpse run to work out what went wrong and make adjustments so your group actually experienced 'progression'. Today the run backs are so short that most groups that struggle with anything just run back, rez, pull because omg there's not time my bars are full, bash their heads against the hard thing with no adjustments and die again and get frustrated and leave.
---
In vanilla groups I was in simply didn't make that second pull until adjustments were made (and you had time to make them on the run back) - no point in dying again and repeating that corpse run if we're not going to improve the strat!
---
Or you arrive at the entrance just in time for the tank or healer to AFK-logout waiting for you.
---
Memories.
---
Sort by new and you'll find the good stuff that the kids cba to read and upvote.
---
The graphics going from EQ to WoW seemed so childish back then. I'm used to it now, even going to and from EQ to WoW periodically
---
Someone brought that up to me earlier as well in my guild discord. I'm unfamiliar with the XP requirements and just how many quests were around then. I know it's a small amount but don't know specifics. I also thought about after Loch Modan, heading to Darkshore and doing the quests out there. Following the quest path back up into wetlands and then continue my journey north. 
---
It's either that or grind my face off for awhile, which isn't that enjoyable. 
---
You have any ideas?
---
I suppose. I’ve just never been so hard up for gold that it keeps me from playing the game when I want to because of a repair bill. And when leveling? Like 14s?
---
What was so funny to me is that in WOTLK, there was an addon called AVR, that was basically doing all of this.  WoW broke it because it trivialized boss fights.
---
Wildstar was announced and I was like "that's the addon that WoW broke".
---
Then WoW started integrating it into the base game.
---
Why'd they ever break AVR in the first place?
---
Blizzard could and should do a little more effort in making the community engaged in Classic by releasing more content about the development.
---
Retail is fun, I play very casually
---
I know it wasn’t in Vanilla (hence the Wrath part).  But yeah, I’ve got no clue what passive they’re talking about.
---
Spirit and rep are cool, but not OP like the Orc stun resist.
---
You can't go wrong with both of you going HotW spec.  Allows you both to do cat DPS and bear tank, along with a respectable amount of healing if you have the gear.  It's by far the most versatile spec, and will allow both of you to change rolls on the fly without having to respec.
---
Charred vale has the earliest mobs that drop elemental fire and earth. Hugely valuable grinding spot.
---
I like warlock tanks because I use them and have fun with them.
---
Should I roll a warlock tank?
---
I think paladins are fine for 5 man tanking, but there is certainly more that goes into the decision than just what you think is fun, because as much fun as a warlock tank might be to somebody, it might be less fun overall to have a harder time finding group or being effective in your roll. 
---
The same concept willy apply to Paladin tanks. As a paladin tank it will be harder to find groups and you will be less effective than warrior tanks. Doesn't mean you can't find any groups. Doesn't mean you can't do your roll. It just means you have some extra hurdles in front of you.
---
It also entirely removes the option of raiding as a tank from the table. I aware he said he didn't want to raid, but people change their minds on shit all the time. If you change your mind and you rolled a paladin, you are up shit creek with no paddle. Also pug MC raids down the line when people are farming AQ are going to be a no go.
---
The longer an expansion goes on the harder it's going to be. You will be less and less geared comparatively speaking to other tanks on the market to do 5 mans. 
---
None of this is to deter anyone from playing what they want to play, but there is more that goes into a decision than just 1 thing and giving people all the info they need to decide is important.
---
Good old days.  I hope they'll let us train world bosses in classic.
---
according to other comments, they will be.
---
Paladin or Drood
---
No can do. Here I get paid to do crap on my phone! It’s like the old saying says, “Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that’s why I poop on company time.”
---
you'll go to thottbot then
---
He got the enchant from a hunter, not he is a hunter.
---
Hmm maybe. Right now I am quite pessimistic about a release date before 1. August. We will have to see what they say in the next blue posts.
---
Chugging the dew
---
These threads get posted 20 times per day and the answer is always "No!"
---
Oh definitely is the cheapest by far. It's just annoying to level because you need mats from pretty much all other professions. Obviously mining works the best with it, but you can also just buy it from the AH instead or a friend. 
---
About alchemy I wouldn't say it's worth it a lot because there's always someone in your guild who can craft your pots for you. 
---
Tailoring unlocks the uber robe at 60 which beats the snot out of any other chest piece until T3, unless you go for full T2 ofc. Quite an expensive and grindy robe though so if that's not your style then just skip it. Far from every priest will wear it.
---
I've been doing a Divinity playthrough with a buddy of mine. It's been a great time!
---
Jesus Christ be praised!
---
Every day, this thread is made. Ever day, i downvote it.
---
Why do they call it unlimited data if you only get 22gb?
---
Come on, everyone knows it's your firefox.
---
Get a faster browser.
---
Because this is an MMO and not a solo game. Other peoples opinions actually do matter because you are going to need them.
---
Yes warriors will be over populated. Good warriors will be in high demand.  Good warriors that are also tanks will be extremely hard to come by.  If you meet those conditions you will basically be treated as a god and will have no problems doing whatever content you want. 
---
Druid DPS takes much more effort than most classes to only stay in the middle of the pack.  Druid tanks are pretty handy for end game dungeons, and most guilds will also likely have one as off tank for raids.
---
That’s a good question! You’ll have to ask the telecom companies.
---
Not got every series of Frasier though
---
I can't remember when but before the first stat squish, or was it the 2nd, when people were hitting numbers in the 10s of millions. the numbers were so high. Bosses were having nearly 1 billion health or more. It was getting bad. The years have combined into one clump of memories I can't hardly remember certain small details like that anymore. But I can tell you the strats to almost every single raid boss since TBC.
---
The essentials
---
Not him, me.  I would think it would be easier from the top of the wind rider tower, but that fall isn't as high as the Zeppelin tower outside of Undercity.
---
nice throwback.
---
I played but I was a kiddo and didnt make it past the 40s in vanilla.
---
We definitely did binding runs as 20-man in MC, so up to Geddon. Not sure if you can do the rest, Majordomo seems like a nightmare without 4 mages and 4 tanks. Raggy should be easy though.
---
Target dummies don’t have any armor or resistance values this isnt BFA. 
---
People do use these in solo play with engineering items but for the most part it’s not efficient waste consumables on solo play unless it’s high tier pvp were these items are also used. 
---
&gt;it hasn’t happened so far, why would it suddenly happen now?  
---
?????Because you are removing the debuff limit now? No one has ever even tested unlimited debuff raid damage in vanilla because it has never happened and will never happen. Saying this won’t effect people who aren’t trying is a null value, if they’re not trying then nothing effects them. And obviously logging websites are skewed, it takes into account a 30 minute cooldown for warriors making them look like gods. This is all really basic stuff. 
---
If you just wanna argue about stuff without knowing anything about it I hear Twitters great for that. Your entire argument is “I know nothing but I can’t be that wrong”. Not responding after this because it’s not helping anyone. Glhf
---
why wouldnt you just hide helmet?
---
Haha it’s all good, they are in after school till 6most nights anyway. I finish at 4....normally go cycling. But I could gym it early at 6am, and leave a couple hrs for grinding before I pick them up 😂👍
---
I remember AVR! I never used it, but I watched people play who did, and it just looked... so... lame... like, why would you play a game, and have an addon reduce it to such a basic state. I'm sure Classic will have lots of addons that exceed what Vanilla addons were capable of, but I'm gonna be sad if we get something like Weak Auras. I may misunderstand what that actually is, but it sounds like a modern AVR?
---
Please dont call them dungs
---
If an MMO was sold at me saying "no addons" I'd be disinclined to play it. Addons are what makes the game playable for me. The default UI is so trash. I feel like instead of it being a selling point, it's a cop out that they don't have to implement a safe system for UI and scripting because it's extra engineering work they don't have to do, rather than some kind of bonus.
---
Haha I plan to get them to grind some mobs for me. 👍
---
Human Female Paladin: BigCritties.
---
Yup. It works.
---
Just farm irl?
---
Because the base UI is shit.
---
if i was horde, i would probably run less rogues and warlocks because of racials you are fighting against.
---
Right, if theres 5-10 mins of regrouping, then everyone has a moment to reflect and improve. If it's immediate, it's so much easier to just take 5 seconds and blame everybody else. It must be their fault, I did my job right?
---
I've only ever played healers in classic end game, and always did quite well for myself.  Decided to be selfish this time around and roll mage and give DPS an honest effort.  
---
I just wanna say that anyone here that has any hesitations about playing a healer just need to give it a shot!  It's so much fun, and not nearly as stressful as you think it is.  Healers also rarely take the blame for wipes.  You get treated very well also.
---
I've had some painful times around Blackrock mountain because of that :/
---
Depends, mail and plate armor cost significantly more to repair than cloth and leather does. Once you hit your mid 30s it can creep up to 1g or more to repair all your broken shit. Costs only go up from there.
---
If you're in the middle of a quest that takes a while to get to on foot, wouldn't be worth it.  But if you're just about done in a zone, spirit rezing wouldn't be that bad of an idea.
---
It's also healthy to take 10-15 minute breaks every couple of hours or so. But I dont even do that consistently so I'm not going to try to convince anyone otherwise lol.
---
Warlock/mage is really easy. Lots of crafted stuff and questrewards. Depends a bit on which phase as well, obviously when DM comes out you'll have to run that a few times. You can buy bloodvine when ZG is out and the T0.5 bosses drop some good items as well.
---
Don't forget "runs lower levels through RFC or WC" (guess that's probably horde only.)
---
Female dwarves ... the reason that dwarves are known as heavy drinkers.
---
dungs
---
WHOOOOOOOOSH
---
lose
---
If it is a WH40k reference, I think Khorne was sitting on a Skull throne though (he even had this playable skulltaker herald of his). But tbh the corpsecamp at STV rather reminds of Slaanesh sadism more than of Khorne despite the skeletons :/
---
Hunters or mages are really good at helping lowbies too.
---
This is what made wpvp great
---
Retail, and Diablo II whenever I get an itch for it. Blasting fools left and right with a Javazon.
---
other people's opinion about how much fun you are having? fuck em, have the fun you are having so long as you do not wreck anyone else's ability to have fun too.
---
Inventory management is not a QoL change.
---
I could see guild banks, but even then I'd rather just not even open the door at all with game changes. The easiest way to keep everyone happy is to not change anything.
---
The impact of slot efficiency can be alleviated by bag space. The sooner you start making a handful of extra silver, the sooner you can start buying bigger bags. The sooner you can start buying bigger bags, the less you have to worry about slot efficiency. I use skinning to buy 6 slot bags from a vendor ASAP on a fresh server. I then use my excess gold from skinning to upgrade to 8 then 10 slot bags. it costs 9g 20s (8g of that alone is from the 4 10 slot bags) to buy 4 of each bag type (6, 8, 10), then I just mail them to my bank alt when I replace them (you can sell them too to make some of your money back). Slot efficiency is only relevant when your bags are full. Seems the logical step is to rely on the minimal gold gained by early skinning to upgrade your bags asap. You say "maybe 10g" by level 40, I read "12 free bags when I really need them" by level 40.
---
A bit of an unorthodox question, but what is the best class for max level solo content, including Dungeons? I'm less concerned about dps than I am about self sustainability.
---
Stay to the left, easy.
---
This is actually a dope idea
---
I have always played on RP-PvP (at least until they changed how servers work) so I'll probably do the same for Classic.
---
&gt; you can clear all vanilla combat with the default ui
---
Thanks for confirming you've never actually played vanilla.
---
I've exclusively played healers in classic end game, and most recently a druid. 
---
What you listed as a negative, no out of combat Rez, I found was my favorite aspect of druid healing.  It is SO nice to not have to rez the raid after a wipe. You'll usually get one of the first rezzes because you're a healer, then you can basically afk for 5 minutes while everyone else gets their shit together.
---
There are shitloads of misconceptions.
---
Fear was always shit in Vanilla, Seduce was where skill was displayed.    
---
Sheep-&gt;Pyro-&gt;PoM+DualTrinkets+Pyro was like 70% of mage pvp until trinket stacking was nerfed.  
---
PvP trinkets had exclusions to what they removed.  (Eg, Rogues cannot trinket stuns, Priest cannot trinket Seduce, Hunter cannot trinket Fear)  
---
Frost PVP Mages are from TBC arenas, and people remembered them in vanilla.  I would know since my frost named mage alt was fire until TBC.
---
35% of the time your interrupt against a holy paladin would just fail if they were spec'ed correctly.  
---
Roots had no DR.
---
I'd prefer a "no add-on" MMO with an awesome UI, but nobody seems capable of making a good UI since they all hand it over to the art team to draw fancy fantasy bezels rather than UX researchers. 
---
There certainly are problems that heavily customizable UIs cause to the players and to designers. How do you balance pvp when 10% of your population has cast bars and the other does not. How do you make an interesting threat mechanic when every player is running threat meters. And the fact that there is exists an add-on to squelch all of the error messages thrown by all of your other add-ons speaks to the problems with the add-on community as a whole.
---
So in an ideal world "no addons" should be a selling point, but until game devs letting chimpanzees with AfterEffects design their UIs, you're basically right.
---
Haha, Venna, of course I remember you! I was a NE Hunter, Loading was the name.
---
I think it was 7 days.  But yeah, it meant if you lost your body in an area with lots of mobs, you were fucked without begging people to help you.
---
Why that's seen as a good thing is beyond me.  They may say WoW has no death penalty, but it doesn't need to be ridiculously harsh unless death is extremely rare to happen (which in EQ it was not)
---
almost certainly hunter, but what do you mean exactly by "solo content including dungeons"?
---
I just don't understand how they'd do this with Classic. A fresh 60 vs Naxx geared 60 is already an insane difference, introduction of another tier is just going to make this problem worse. They'd have to overhaul itemization and specs so that the power creep is far less, then you have a different game than Classic WoW.
---
[Citation needed] I'd be surprised if 50% even had broadband
---
If I had to take one of those to a desert island for the rest of my days, it would be con air. 'Dear Casey. School is very important'.
---
I would roll on an rp-pvp if they had rp-pvp.
---
O
---
This boss was my unkillable demon lord back in the days. We tried him a million times and kept wiping. Damn it was frustrating. Never seen naxx because of him because i quit raiding afterwards because of frustration. Screw you C‘Thun I will never forget what you have done to us! Sadly I won‘t see him in classic because now I got a job and other stuff. Time flies by
---
Resto druid main when playing with friends or groups.  Hunter alt when your by yourself. Thats my plan.
---
The laws of equivalent exchange.
---
Yep! Part of why I am goin PVE server next time. 
---
Can help people without them turning on me, or without all the negative feelings/anxiety.
---
My shaman choice when I get around to making one will be Tauren. I like the cow-nature feel of the character. In vanilla, always play what you like over what is "best".
---
I love this idea and have discussed it on the official forums a few times as well. I think it would be a massive undertaking to port over expansion assets to the classic client and rebuild their content, and even more to determine what stays, what goes, and what changes.
---
I had a huge wall of text of ideas but it got pretty... unwieldy so suffice to say I would love to see expansions re-tuned to vanilla mechanics, balance, and design.
---
Regular expansion servers should be given priority, though.
---
Blizzard has a history of being friendly to modding. The user interface, when sandboxed within a constrained set of actions that can be performed by the code that Addons add to the game, is the only avenue to provide a means of user customization in a game like WoW.
---
Most of Blizzard's game have some supported means of modding. The only one I can think of where this is not the case is Diablo 3. Even Overwatch just introduced a means of scripting custom game modes and even full custom heros.
---
Modding in the PC gaming universe used to be commonplace, Blizzard is one of the few companies keeping that tradition alive.
---
My girlfriend and I are planning to roll on an RP server. We were considering RP-PvP if possible, but after messing around a bunch on a pserver we've decided that getting ganked is just too irritating, so we'd rather completely eliminate the possibility. Looking forward to battlegrounds though!
---
We haven't fully fleshed out the RP aspects, but I feel like a good part of that will be on the fly, and we have solid foundations. We have 4 pairs of characters planned, with names and professions already picked out:
---
Human Paladin and Priest (Blacksmithing/Engineering and Enchanting/Tailoring)  
---
Night Elf Druid and Hunter (Alchemy/Herbalism and Skinning/Leatherworking)  
---
Undead Warlock and Mage (Enchanting/Tailoring and Alchemy/Herbalism)  
---
Orc Hunter and Warlock (Skinning/Leatherworking and Mining/Engineering)
---
The humans, of course, will be zealous holy crusaders, smiting evil\* wherever they find it. My holy/discipline smite priest will synergize well with my girlfriend's Sanctity Aura and Judgement of the Crusader. I'm really looking forward to playing a classic/vanilla holy priest, because while she *is* primarily holy, some part of her couldn't help dabbling in the darker side of things with SW:P etc.
---
The undead casters will be a vengeful pair, seeking arcane and demonic knowledge to claw back as much personal agency as they can. As an alchemist, my mage will also be something of a nerdy mad scientist chick (of the scholarly arts and witch's brew variety).
---
The night elves (naturally (see what I did there?)) will be our nature heroes, with a love for the wild and rugged outdoors. My girlfriend's druid will be the more mystically inclined, with her weird moon magic and advanced herb lore, while my hunter found herself more adept with her bow and direct communion with wild beasts. I'm planning to tame a cat, bear and wolf.
---
The orcs were the last pair we came up with; leveling should be interesting as a pair of pet classes, to say the least. Of my three casters, my orc will be the tough girl; I'm not sure if she quite realized what she was getting into when she started dabbling with the dark arts, but she's committed to the path now and finds her ability to dominate demons intoxicating (most likely going for a Soul Link demonology build). Like my mage, she's also a bit of a mad scientist, but of the "bombs and gizmos and forbidden tomes" variety. Her hunter friend is definitely the more level-headed of the two, but still willing to adventure to the ends of Azeroth with her.
---
None of our characters will be *good*, not even the priest and paladin (although that pair most certainly see themselves as good); the night elves are probably the least unhinged? But that is not to say that any of them are unkind, to their allies at least. Contrary to stereotypes (in RPGs in general, I mean), playing a chaotic or evil or simply non-good character doesn't automatically mean the character is a dick or a murder hobo.
---
Our humans may do it out of their genuine desire to help people (colored as it may be by their somewhat misguided sense of righteousness), our undead because it's generally a good idea (and, perhaps there is something lingering in their hearts), our orcs and night elves simply because they really do care.
---
God, I'm excited to actually roll these girls!
---
This. I was 25, had years of gaming experience under my belt, and was absolutely blown away by the size of the in game world.
---
PalyBro, I plan on being a PalySwol PalyBro who helps all that Palyknow.
---
I hope I'll get to experience the boundless joy of logging on my level 16 after a long day of work, and instantly be destroyed by a dragon outside the auction house
---
&gt; fuck em,
---
You aren't getting what I'm saying. The 'fuck em' mentality is how you end up not getting invited to groups anymore. You can't have fun if nobody wants to play with you.
---
There is no hard evidence on what the Orc Racial actually did to my knowledge.  It is speculated that it was not ~30% stun resist (5+25).
---
What a cool, original idea!
---
My travel form will beat even high-level mounts
---
do you honestly believe that prot paladins wont be invited to groups?
---
Almost every spec is VIABLE but many aren’t OPTIMAL for that class
---
I was 25 and remember everything.
---
Super underrated pets, they have the same base stats as wolves but can learn Screech, Claw, and Bite. DPS isn't as high as an owl but they are tougher, and all but one of their skins is available before level 20 (Red one is best though).
---
I havent played the newer expansions that much but did they stop giving enchants some glowing? This was always king for me like the white glowing weapon enchant...what was the name again hmm..
---
Those seem pretty ancillary.
---
Personally I think Kotor II has a more interesting story. But Kotor I had better RPG gameplay. Especially because Kotor II had incredibly broken abilities like Force Crush
---
They did that with the new launcher for a while, it might still do afaik.
---
You'd get x kB/s from blizz and then another "boost" from p2p connections near you
---
Meld is pretty amazing.
---
Rogues and shadowpriests are far and few between in premades.
---
Planetside 2. I Love the MMO aspect of the game and would recommend it
---
I mean if you weren't botting...Just fight it?
---
I’m confused by which 3 things you are saying a spec can do. Feral = tank/melee, resto = heal/ranged, balanace = ranged/heal? What’s the third?
---
Shrek 2 was my first pc game which my dad bought for me, also the last. He made a big mistake showing me that u can play games on pc 😂
---
Still so torn.  
---
\-Would love to play fire mage, but I know it's frost until AQ40 and until you're out of BWL (never, thanks to Nef tear?)  it's a lot of respeccing (oh well, maybe worth it). And I'm not one of those guys who plays pvp undead frost mage and blinks around screwing with people and kiting stuff. Probably tailoring/alchemy.  
---
\-Like shadow priest, but did it once on a private server through naxx and I don't think I ever want to need consumes that badly again just be me mediocre. I had dreamfoil coming out of my ears.  
---
\-Never played warrior or rogue, but I played ret paladin 2.4.3 and absolutely loved it more than anything. Maybe I should go fury warrior (although it's not fast leveling, and worse, the gear grinds and ironfoe/msa runs could be horrific, plus you probably need a ton of gromsblood)  
---
\-Lock... eh, maybe, probably too boring, but solid pew pews and nobody hates you, just no bag space cuz the shards.  
---
\-Feral. rawr. jk.
---
IDK if Kotor II is better than Kotor I - but after they patched the bugs it was certainly a worthy successor.
---
God dam Loch Ness monster
---
Can't be sure about Classic but I did it on my Tauren hunter in actual Vanilla, so if they stay faithful it's doable.
---
I believe its also because his character isn't the brightest in the head. Leading him to say his feelings/thoughts with out a filter. I figured this since at the war counsel tables he has been a part of he talks like he kinda does/doesn't know what going on, also adding to other interactions where he seems to be uneducated not just in formalities.
---
If you werent playing it you were probably hacked.  See if you can fight it.
---
It doesnt really matter though since you can't play your old characters in classic.
---
My first character in Vanilla was a dwarf hunter. From that point of view, I had a quite decent time in battlegrounds and wpvp. 
---
There are a few advantages to rolling dwarf, other than the afformentioned stoneform. The extra skill with guns and higher base stamina will allow you to hit harder and run for longer than a night elf. Being quite short(but thicc) can also be beneficial in pvp as you use line of sight to your advantage. 
---
I sometimes did wish i had shadowmeld just to surprise people, but I didnt find it to be gamebreaking. Im not sure if it worked after feign death, It might be worth a try if it will in Classic.
---
The build you mentioned, does it fill a healer role for PVP or a dps role?
---
I agree. This sub has turned into karma whoring, super unoriginal shit posting and meme recycling. And not in a good way. Low effort with a lot of cry babies.
---
!remindme 24 hours
---
&gt; I like warlock tanks because I use them and have fun with them.
---
&gt; Should I roll a warlock tank?
---
Sure.  Why should I care how you want to have fun?  Get a bunch of pals and go crazy.  The whole point of playing Classic is to have fun with an old game.
---
You comparing VW tanks to Pally tanks is just a stretch.  Paladins can tank just fine.  No one said your character is guaranteed to be the best raider in the world.
---
But if you want to take your VW into some five mans with other wacky builds, go for it.  You do you.
---
We got 1Gbps fiber optic here a couple years ago (rural area in Oregon).  Been loving it ever since.  Though, I think it's a bit over kill because most places where you download large files only use maybe 50-70% max of the capacity of 1Gb.
---
Hard to say, been playing on pservers for a while. When I started in 2011, I suppose it had only been 4-5 years at the time. I pretty much remembered everything at the time, as I hated most changes from BC-Cata, I would constantly compare them to the way Vanilla was, so I didnt forget much. Minor things I had forgotten like Innervate no longer required Resto. I remembered all the boss fights and such though and since Ive played pservers since then I havent forgotten now. Quest routing I remembered at the time and remember even better now.
---
I do remember my Rich Thorium Vein route in EPL perfectly and I can tell you that theres no pserver yet Ive seen that does mining vein spawns correctly.

Holy shit this is genius! Probably gon let my little brother stay at my place a lot more!

well, TBH... there are a lot of questions "which class"... and the answer is almost always Druid, regardless of the question

3 Graveyards. X-roads, Ratchet, Camp T.
---
Wouldn't warrior be more useful for PUGs? Tanks are rare in vanilla.
---
You won't need a full tankbuild. Just gear.
---
What? I've never played a pvp server , are there safe areas?
---
Personally id be all over that stone form if you aren’t married to the aesthetics of NElves
---
Easiest - hunters
---
Hardest - hunter pets
---
Basically the most difficult stuff to solo imaginable, like level 60 dungeon content. I've always loved soloing extremely hard shit, regardless of whether or not it's pointless/inefficient to do so. It's weird I know, but I enjoy it.
---
Thanks ithilras, very cool!
---
Use a VPN like Private Internet Access (works on mobile/windows/mac with one account) and you can browse whatever you want on any WiFi connection
---
You can do a 70-80% good job at everything dps/tank/heal as any spec when you’re Druid if you’re helping lowbies
---
You just hit the lottery. If your account was hacked and banned for botting you can claim it and likely you'll get to keep all the gold they farmed throughout all this time.
---
Paladin. Just stick a lowbie ,buff them and judge light. Doesnt take exp either cause JoL doesnt do damage
---
Hunters and Warlocks are undeniably your best content soloers. Now, there's a spectrum of content soloing. You mention self sustainability which is a huge factor when it comes to being independent, but there's also clear speed and mechanical accessibility. Won't go into too much detail, but as an example, prot Paladins can find a niche soloing certain undead-type dungeon sections, but can't do other types of solos because of their lack of pets. Ya get? If you just want to be able to do the most alone, just go warlock or hunter.
---
If you remember getting a specific epic, why would you net remember getting a specific epic which brought you a shitload of gold?
---
Appeal it. Blizzard suspends accounts in part to protect the account itself in the event that it's been "hacked".
---
I got an email notifying me I was banned indefinitely during Wrath for "manipulation of the in-game economy" or some such. I'd been away on a fishing trip all week with my husband and some friends. I appealed it, and it was overturned quickly because it was easy to verify that my account being accessed in China wasn't normal account activity for me.
---
If you weren't botting or doing anything actually suspicious, appeal it.
---
Anything else that doesn't go without saying?
---
I'll give you some bullets from the ["mission"](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/mission.html) link /u/ratnose gave in this thread further down, in regards to Battle for Azeroth is particular.
---
What /u/cdank is referencing when he says "developed to perfection" is Blizzard polish, which falls under "commit to quality" in their mission.
---
Gameplay First:
---
They want their games to be fun for as many people as possible.
---
* BFA - Considering the general tone of both the wow subreddit, the wow forums, and comments on wow related Youtube videos, The majority of players do not find BFA to be fun. As their goal is to reach as many as gamers as possible, they failed this.
---
* Vanilla - The game was so fun it spread like wildfire, subscriber numbers never decreased throughout the entirety of Vanilla's era. Sure, it wasn't perfect, but people had fun.
---
Commit to Quality: We seek honest feedback and use it to improve the quality of our work. At the end of the day, most players won’t remember whether the game was late -- only whether it was great.
---
* BFA - During BFA's beta, they ignored player feedback regarding Azerite traits, shadow priests, and elemental shamans, just off the top of my head. The game was released anyways, and, again, the general opinion is that the game was rushed.
---
* Vanilla - I don't have personal experience during Vanilla's beta, but I do know they listened to feedback about how the rested system worked as well as stuff like female troll models. Vanilla did have some shortfalls, but keep in mind that Vanilla was massive in comparison to its expansions in both size and scope, and with less developers. People wanted, and got, a game that was huge, mysterious, and fun.
---
I doubt you'll see many people with over 60 resistance, which is just the buff. If people are still wearing T1 and T2 you might see some people with 80 or even 100 with the engineering trinkets. 
---
Spell pen is quite rare too, T2.5 warlock has 20 on vest and 10 each on legs and shoulders I believe. Then there's a ring from Skeram and his staff, and of course the Kel'Thuzad staff has like 25 spell pen. 
---
I think for normal pug v pug PvP you'll do well with like 20 spell pen, in premades probably up to 50-60 as you have to gimp yourself a bit to go beyond that. Mages actually get spell pen from their talents. I can't remember how much but I think it's like 10 or 20. Having reliable polymorphs and fears is really important.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by heartbeat spells, but binary spells are spells which either do their full effect or nothing. I.E it can't be partially resisted like a shadowbolt. So curses, dots, debuffs, CC and so on are binary spells. Damage spells with an added effect are also considered binary, so Frostbolt is binary because of the frost effect, but fireball is not. 
---
Non-binary spells are spells that only do direct damage and these spells can be partially resisted.
---
Spell Pen is really strong when applicable. It's basically a 2,5% dps boost per 10 spell pen, so on bosses like the nightmare dragons who have 200 resistance it's quite useful. Unfortunately most raid bosses have 75 or even 0 resistance, notable exceptions being Ebonroc, Lucifron and Kel'Thuzad.
---
It shouldn’t be on me to make their site manageable to use. I don’t use adblock personally so WoWhead clogs up my system like nothing else.
---
All he wanted was tree fitty...
---
I play mostly by myself and for that reason I play hunter, there are lots of things you can solo by being clever that other classes won't be able to attempt.
---
LOK’THAR BROTHER
---
Well it could be but it seems like only the 1-10 zones are what's been mentioned officially. I think 10-20 zones should definitely be sharded because by level 20 people won't be clumped up as much and there are alternative options like doing instanced dungeons at that point.
---
Some buffs are rank/level locked for example fort buff, but you should always be able to hit a lowbie with a rank higher than is capable at their level
---
(Burning a candle will also get you extra lovins)
---
Weak Auras is entirely different.  It gives you a way to track your abilities timers, charges, and cooldowns.
---
I use it as a sort of HUD interface because I use a lot of things like clique and space-saver macros.  If I'm healing, I left-click on someone and it uses Healing Touch, right-click and Regrowth, B4 and Rejuv, B5 and swiftmend.  Because Swiftmend has a CD, and it's not on my action bar, I use Weak Auras to track it.
---
Similarly, I tend to use a lot of macros like:
---
(pound)showtooltip
---
/cast [nomod:shift] Arcane Shot
---
/cast [mod:shift] Multi-Shot
---
With a macro like that, I have to hit shift to see my CD on MS, and let go of shift to see my CD on arcane shot, so having Weak Auras lets me see both at all times.
---
I used AVR, because we were pushing for server firsts, and if we have a tool available, why not use it?
---
Hi, /u/TheDaliComma
---
love the post. Had an automatic physical reaction when I read "Staff of Jordan dropped for me in Badlands and I was so excited to get my first purple that I equipped it, as a warrior ..." lol
---
One day after a raid me &amp;  two other paladins in the guild decided to kite Teremus the Devourer to Stormwind. 
---
He had an AOE life drain that healed him and it was not until after all the low levels had been eaten that he was stopped.
---
While leveling a priest can be a godsend. Throwing buffs heals and shields to everyone you pass by.
---
Spider Silk!
---
There were both. 4 disc is the original. The 5th disc was for the major patches. So if you got it after 1.1, I believe it was the 5 disc version.
---
No changes!
---
Except talent tree reworks and general class balance
---
And cheap respecs
---
And arenas
---
And dungeon finder 
---
And character 60 boosts
---
And flying mounts
---
But that’s it. No other changes.
---
I started in open-beta. It took a long time but yes I finally achieved lvl 60.
---
Reading the comments I think a few people are being less than truthful as what they're saying didn't exist then and/or the amount of time they claim it took to get to lvl 60.
---
Hi, /u/wakeor
---
Why can’t they make games like this anymore?
---
Not to mention it's generally got a good bit of mining nodes as well.
---
Level 29 hunter, you won't regret. Gear is pretty easy to get, and the biggest reason to why its easy is because your weapon is from a quest line. You just have to have friends to do that tho, its the stv animal hunting quests, end of the quest chain you get a gun, obtainable before 30. You can start the stv chain at lvl 28.
---
i think the issue is just that there hasn’t been enough news to warrant even more long discussion.  This is a sub about WoW Classic specifically, which has yet to be released.
---
I suspect it’s content will change a lot after release.
---
Germany?
---
wat do you mean? dont tell me they are gonna do some anti griefing revisions
---
True. I was 24 I wasnt trying to "escape", i wasnt some anti-social nerd . I had a good job, fighting pro mma and smashing pussy. Then some nerds at work got me to play WoW. loved it, still play it and cant wait for classic.
---
Paladin is your answer. You'll be able to do pulls Hobbs style, although probably not quite as large.
---
The first 2 zones are "green" for their respective fashion, so if it's your faction you can't be killed by opposing faction unless you flag yourself, opposing faction is automatically tagged. Third zone and on is all contested territory, so everyone is always flagged.
---
Your idea is good. I would recommend that you always kill all the mobs you see that are almost on your way, even if they are not needed for any quests. Even then, you might actually need a trip to darkshore mid Loch modan, before doing the final elite quests. It's true that you're not to far from darkshoee byways, I'd take the occasion to put your hearth at menethil.
---
So you're talking about respecing out of your raid spec after every raid night?  I don't think that's usually necessary when you can just change out of your main spec after the last raid of the week and then spec back before the first raid of the next week.
---
I was there, as Horde.
---
It was brutal.
---
Why are you so concerned with gnomes? The opposite of love isn't hate, it's detachment. If you hate something, that means that it actually means something to you.
---
Edited :o
---
Mohawk class is best class.
---
Just commenting to say dwarf 1-10 is made a lot easier by their starting melee weapon. Night elves are the only hunger race that doesn’t start with a one handed axe and a dagger instead. Good luck with your decision.
---
More than I thought I did.  Also apparently I’m solid on dungeons until lvl 60 then will need refreshers.
---
LOK'TAR*
---
I smell an alliance spy. Shit, wait...
---
Back in the days it was wow or guildwars.. nobody was about to know that you know the other side:D
---
Tremor is for fear. Use grounding for cc/silence
---
This exact meme made the front page like a day ago, what are ya doing man
---
Tough choice. From a shareholder perspective, you have much more risks of quitting the game if you play warrior because the grind to 60 will take you months, and you might get discouraged. Warlock will get you to 60 faster and is very fun to level, but once you're 60, do you see yourself liking the class? PvP will keep you busy, but some people don't like being a shadowbolt-spamming curse bitch.
---
G-nomes are the scum of Azeroth. I'll rip out their intestines and use them to store conjured food.  Gnome sausages are back on the menu boys.
---
It would take a massive overhaul. Also Classic is a bit easier to just plop out a 1.12 version. While there were certainly nerfs to dungeons in Vanilla, it wasnt nearly to the extent that BC had with nerf hammers and catchup gear. Like, doing a random Heroic for a daily badge would have been absolute suicide in pre-nerf Heroics unless it was a really easy one like Slave Pens or Underbog. Heck, even then, most people in my guild wouldnt even complete Slave Pens when doing their SSC attunement, they would just do the quest and leave. All the earlier raids also kept getting nerfed so people could catchup.
---
I would honestly be happy if they released BC with the "original" difficulties (not counting the nerfs they did to fix bugs or balance things only a few weeks after release), but I wouldnt bother to play a straight up 2.4 version of it.
---
Was there pvp and ganking and stuff? I don’t see how that approach would ever fly in an area like stv
---
People with that attitude make name for themselves quickly. Word spreads.
---
FR! I just love Trolls, especially warriors! Troll dw'ing are just badass.
---
That said, i cant choose between them and orcs, because im gonna pvp alot and it would really help vs all those rogues. Hard times. 
---
Now since i cant decide, gonna play mage.
---
&gt;However, Stoneform seems to fill a void against rogues
---
Best defense against rogues is them not seing you at all, i know shadowmeld is a defensive ability mostly useful for guarding a flag in AB or a choke point in AV but dont underestimate the power of having the element of surprise, its really really fun :)
---
I still feel like lvl 19 hunter twink is better than the 19 rogues. They get bassicly the same gear so getting them ready is pretty straight forward. But hunter gets those killing blows.
---
Lolz
---
I've mainly played shaman throughout my years in WoW starting right before BC then on and off (took big breaks in MoP, WOD and now BFA). 
---
I think I'd like a fresh new start and I considered leveling a rogue once classic comes out, a class I've never played past level 20 or so. 
---
I have a few questions :
---
\- for people with vanilla WoW and servers that shall not be named experience, is the overpopulation of rogues an issue (finding groups especially at a higher level ? I'll probably be able to play a decent amount of time but not as much as I once could.
---
\- Is there a lot of downtime while leveling ? (probably a fair mount since rogues don't have a heal but stealth might make it easier idk).
---
On the RP side, i've always liked to play "pragmatic" characters, that will do what they must to achieve their goals. For veteran rogue players do you actually feel that wa
---
It certainly isnt marginal to have that high stun resist, factoring in the shitloads of rogues u're gonna see in pvp.
---
Gnomes are the master race.  We shall lay waste to you scum horde.  Crawl back into your mud hut.
---
I want to play a caster that hits really hard. Like chaos bolt, aimed shot, greater pyro on live. (Pvp) any suggestions ?
---
This happened to my OSRS account and I made like 7b gold. It was nuts
---
From what I've read there was a way to flag yourself for PVP. If you did you couldn't turn it off ever and could only interact with others who were also flagged. So kinda like a PVP server where you could see but not group or buff or anything with non PVP
---
Yuuuup and god forbid your mom uninstalls WoW and then you have to hope to christ one of them isn't scratched and you have to start all over again.
---
You're in demand for poops
---
I think a lot of people see those Enhance PvP videos and think they are so amazingly good in PvP, but really to get those clips to make one video it took 100 BG's because you're so dependent on RNG with WF proccing and critting. 
---
From experience trying to main an Enhance shaman on a recent pserver, dont do it..really more so because of all the people who will whisper you telling you to go heal.  It was really crushing to get whispered by people when you won a good item just to hear "the shaman got it?!" 
---
Sad days
---
On the profs, either will be useful while leveling and provide some extra gold from gathering, but Herb/Alc is definitely better gold than skinning/Lw at 60.
---
There aren't that many pieces of craftable gear for end game, whereas you'll be chugging potions through Naxx. Most guilds will have a designed leatherworker for the resist gear.
---
2h tho. Dw'ing? Troll is where its at.
---
Stonerform
---
Just did it.  Can confirm it works, even using PayPal Credit!
---
Elves stink?
---
I do as I always have done. 
---
1-10 in my starting zone 
---
5-10 allied zone for abit. 
---
(Example Start dwarf, do 1-10 in dun morgh, then switch to elwynforrest). 
---
11-20 I do some loch Modan quests or dark shore quest then switch over to west fall (for deadmines quests). 
---
Then once done I start in redridge then duskwood.  And wetlands until 30.  
---
Doing stockade and Gnom atleast once to get the quests finished.   
---
Here it depends on how bad stv is at this time. 
---
Desolace /AH is options then go to stv a few levels later.   SM runs is good to gear you now also.  
---
Once your around 40. Get the go to tanaris do a few q then go badlands then go back 
---
Zf and ulda man is good for gearing you.  
---
Sceptre to maradoun / Hammer to zf and start working on the other keys directly 
---
Once I’m 50+ sholomance and onyxia is something i should start early on.
---
You are probably old and grumpy and shouldn't give a shit. I'm old too, but for sure I can get what you want by 1: filtering by new posts and 2: creating the posts with the discussions I want myself.
---
Close the door behind you.
---
Yes, I'm not sure about the Horde graveyard in that area but you should be able to corpse hop through Darnassus.
---
In TBC they added a loading screen to the Darnassus boat even though there's no map transfer. The loading screen is causing you to rez which I also believe is a bug as I recall being able to ride the boat as a ghost.
---
[Darnassus no loading screen](https://www.neoseeker.com/forums/3463/t1200760-wow-how-get-to-darnassus/)
---
I have a source for riding a boat through a loading zone as a ghost but it likely would violate rule #4. It should be one of the top hits if you search for "warcraft ghost traveling."
---
I remember you! Man it's been a while, what are your Classic plans?
---
I love female undeads for meeles! Caster always male tho
---
When a blue post is about Bank of America??
---
Like I said, it's a personal preference.
---
I think every MMO out there allows you to alter the UI in some way. That's not really considered addon support.
---
MMOs like Pantheon that are trying to target a more oldschool audience advertise no addon support because there's a subset of players who don't want the game trivialized by stuff like addons that show you where to go for quests, what to do during raid encounters they haven't fought before, etc.
---
Wrong, those polls group Palas and shamans together, they are wrong.
---
Did this guy just spell Lok'tar wrong?
---
idk why everyone is demonizing wpvp... that it's all skull level characters killing lowbies... in my experience it happens rarely...
---
Look at that dude! Having fun tanking the ***shit*** out of stratholme like a **BOSS**! Yah! Fuck that guy!
---
Oh, that’s cool. Didn’t know I had an original! It’s even still got the $60 price sticker on it.
---
He has like 15 years less wow experience than I do. No, you don't want a shaman to tank after lvl 30 if the content is within 5 levels of him.
---
Whats wrong with you? Its thirteen years ago and just a lil bit of history that TC  decided to share. 
---
I dont remember seeing the title "passive aggressively rate and tear too pieces the UI in this photo also feel free to add pointless statements such as 'hurrd durrr dont need anything to clear Vanilla' " 
---
flamin neckbear.
---
Durotar to 11-12ish, barrens till 15-16, run rfc with all quest. Back to barrens from 16-20. WC at 20 with all quest to 21. Finish up more barrens possibly venture into stone talon or ashenvale for some quest. About lvl 24-25 is as far as I’ve gotten on my pathing. None of this is strict though. So I’m leaving room for better paths.
---
How did you find out?
---
Protection paladin, secondary tank? Wut
---
Sure, but each HUGE benefit is situational. A race choicr might be miles ahead in one situation but not in another.
---
Putting time into a character is a lot in Vanilla. You don't want to waste your time on something you won't like in the end.
---
Good Old Times :D
---
As far as I remember there was no anti grieving. Some NPC guards where rather powerful but it was common to murder flightmasters if you could survive them + the summoned gryphons/bats.
---
I'm a little bit foggy on this but I think there where NPCs that gave negative honor.
---
I have went from saying I’m 100% going undead priest to troll shaman to Tauren shaman to human Paladin to dwarf priest to NE Druid.  We will see how I’m feeling about that in a week or two lol
---
I just have two big doubts: Mage or Priest? Horde or Alliance? xD
---
Same, combat rogue alt on retail is actually really fun right now lol
---
Oh yeah? Have fun being ambushed in your knees mr horde, #GnoMercy
---
I will carry as many dungs as I can.
---
“Killed so many raptors how has the silver not dropped yet!”
---
Overthinking was done i guess. Play what you are best at, and enjoy. Then burst your Head on which alt to pick like me
---
Elder Scrolls Blades, Skyrim VR, Alts in retail.
---
Fast! Get to the choppah! Do it nao!
---
1) All of them.
---
Yeh there won’t be much questing wise in silver pine at 20 that still give exp. if your wanting to utilize it I find 15-16 right after RFC is best time to get there or right after durotar before starting barrens if your wanting to skip out on hunting hooves for hours.
---
That's orc Mike Tyson. He's got a lisp.
---
The traditional Tauren sport of Gnome Punting is loved across all of Azeroth. Even members of the Alliance love watching it.
---
Oh right, my bad
---
Either you can shift your mindset to appreciate the effort to reward equation of classic or you can't.
---
They're the least popular class in the game on private servers
---
oh i misunderstood you then ;p
---
Fuck you, meme on bois
---
More like "neverdary" tank, amirite? xD
---
Hurry up and release classic wow fore ah piss myself
---
The devs were pushed to “finish” it and push it out before being completely ready.
---
I had always wondered why it seemed unpolished, but it is a terrific game and could have been so much better.
---
Between the time commitment to hit 60 and the advantages/disadvantages to each class picking a class is a big decision. Just another thing that makes Vanilla so sweet.
---
Kind of the opposite for me, tbc and wotlk bleed together and not much stands out. I think it was because there weren't any 'great' patches in either.  I had both a priest and mage I barely got to play but when the priest and mage patches were coming out in vanilla I was like "fuck yeah! finally! this is going to be amazing!".  Also, and maybe this was just me, but everyone in tbc and wrath seemed bad and it made the game kind of boring.  I remember doing so many battle bear runs with the ten 'best' people in the guild and like 2 of them were ok and the rest just terrible.
---
Guildbank is not the worst. It's certainly a pretty decent idea and doesn't ruin the game too much. I just think I prefer the trust system more idk. Maybe my perspective is flawed from playing pservers where accounts are free, on a real server having to pay for a brand new account just to have character space for banking does seem rough.
---
Gnomes are for punting from the peaks of thousand needles.
---
Too simple an analogy to account for player burnout
---
I never meant that Oceania players would go to EU-guilds. There is just a handfull of Oceania-guilds posting in the thread and I just meant that they got advertise in the EU-thread but if that's some sort of dealbreaker for ppl then for the love of whatever, they can go post wereever they want. The important thing is splitting EU/NA
---
Yeah, I was never a fan of those either.  KOTOR 1 only had the one instance on Malak’s ship IIRC.
---
Everything, literally everything.
---
The first thing you do is make a full roster of characters and sit all but one right at the Bank mailbox.
---
Orc since there is gonna be a lot of Rogue Twink ?
---
I usually keep anything that is in white text and has a specific name.
---
Yea, it was a late addition.  It was a known big deal in pvp even back in the day.  Don Rodringo's was baseline for any pvp mage, but better stuff came out of AQ and Naxx.

---
For me it was pretty easy, my favourite role in any game is support. So that instantly narrows it down to Shaman for me, and my main alt will most likely be a Warlock cause curses are fun.
---
I’m confused by what point you’re trying to get across. Unless you’re planning to raid with a hardcore competitive guild or dungeoning with a tryhard minmax group the set roles that you’re talking about aren’t worried about as much. If you’re a good player that can do mechanics you can raid as a ret paladin or a balance Druid, etc. you likely just won’t be pushing for realm firsts. I feel like choosing a class is so hard right now mostly just because the game isn’t out. From the looks of it most people on this sub have been spamming refresh and thinking through everything about classic for months, if the game isn’t out to play and all we are doing is reading about different classes, builds, and stories it can be much harder to stick with one decision, partly because there is no downside to changing your decision right now.
---
&gt; Sure. Why should I care how you want to have fun?
---
That really wasn't the question though was it? Nobody is asking you to care or not care about how much fun somebody else is having. The guy wanted help with picking a class and he showed that he is considering multiple things. You told him to ignore everything except this one aspect. 
---
&gt; The whole point of playing Classic is to have fun with an old game.
---
Absolutely. I'm arguing that your overall enjoyment of the game is going to include more than just how much fun the mechanics or fantasy of your class are.
---
&gt; You comparing VW tanks to Pally tanks is just a stretch.
---
I'm not actually trying to compare VW tanks to pally tanks. I'm just showing that viability is worth considering by using an extreme example. I think you know that, I'm not sure why you are straw-maning my argument here. 
---
&gt;  Paladins can tank just fine. No one said your character is guaranteed to be the best raider in the world.
---
I agree. All I'm saying is that there is more to consider than just 1 aspect. Telling people to ignore everything other than how much fun you find a particular class is not a good idea. It should certainly be considered and likely weighted the highest when making your considerations, but certainly you should at least consider other factors right?
---
&gt; But if you want to take your VW into some five mans with other wacky builds, go for it. You do you.
---
Nobody is inviting a warlock to tank level 60 5 mans.  Obviously paladins are different, but it is still worth noting that you will have a harder time than a warrior when finding a group. 
---
If I'm forming a 5 man group and a paladin and warrior tank whisper me at the same time I am certainly taking the warrior. I'm sure there is even people who are assholes that will kick the paladin tank out of the party on the off chance they get messaged by a warrior tank before the run starts. 
---
At a minimum, these things are worth considering and to ignore them entirely is a mistake. The overall enjoyment of the game is more than that.
---
Yes, but only got to the mid 40's was doing ZF and just going to Ungoro when BC came out.
---
Are you sure you're not retarded?
---
I just pick the first thing that comes to mind and stick with it. You can almost always make your class fun to play. I've played 7 out of the 9 classes at 60 on pservers so far, and I've enjoyed them all except warlock, and honestly that was just because I didn't give it enough time as I was about to progress naxx on another server.
---
Anything white will go to my alt bank account....
---
Ok?
---
just don't do kids if you want to live that life.
---
Now it's too late take care of your family morron
---
As others have said, just call customer support and appeal.
---
I was hacked once and didn’t even know about it for like 4-5 years, eventhough they had got the person, imagine my shock when I went to play WoW again.
---
What the fuck is up with all these shitty gifs with static meme captions? Theyre all the same
---
Thats a good thought, i like orc for the bonus pet damage on top of stun resist
---
&gt;I used AVR, because we were pushing for server firsts, and if we have a tool available, why not use it?
---
I entirely get that. If you are trying to be cutting edge, you have to do what you must to beat the competition, especially if the competition is also using those tools. However, I was relieved when the addon got broken, because I’d rather the playing field be leveled, without having to resort to an addon like that.
---
Also, thanks for the info about power auras. I wonder if thats gonna work in Classic or not. I’d die for a blue post about now about how they’re going to let Addons work.
---
Yes my favorite expansion, Battle Over Azerite.
---
Im pretty sure im picking Alliance priest, but what race?
---
I know dwarf comes with 'Fear Ward', but I have never played a Night Elf and I dont like the look of the classic dwarfs...
---
Is 'Fear Ward' enough of a need in raids/dungeons that I should just pick utility over visual preference?
---
choosing a class is hard because we know the outcomes and there is a level of permanence. 
---
If I didnt know warriors were top melee dps and the best (only, really) tank I wouldnt likely consider them. If I didn't know hunters scale poorly by aq/naxx I may choose one--but I'd like to be a "hardcore" oriented raider--I don't intend to blow consumables in mc, i do intend to progress in naxx--and hunters get 2/40 raid slots at that level of progression.
---
My first love in wow is spriest. But I know its a 1/40 shot. meanwhile, mages do more damage and youre gonna see 5-7/40 for them. 
---
That said, locks and hunters will have 3-5 slots, but its mostly due to no one playing those specs--not cause they are shit. 
---
If I were going in blind, only reading the character selection screen fluff--im sure I would make much the same decision I made in 2004.
---
&gt;It's a "freebie" for WoW subscribers.
---
If this is how they see it, I'm a bit worried they will neglect it after the initial hype dies down. 
---
Hopefully you are wrong and they see it as a strategical investment to attract old players back to the game and to keep people who are tired of retail.
---
If there is a solid business case we are more likely to see them spend resources over time on classic.
---
\~ key is easily accessible and is my silence key on every character I play.
---
Feral is generally overlooked in PvP (or at least it was, I cant aay ice kept up with private servers and the like), but it handles Frost extremely well.
---
instantly turn off peer-to-peer sharing because I was an asshole kid
---
Software as a service/the ability to easily patch is a double edged sword.  It allows for fast updates, but it also allows for unfinished software to be released.
---
It used to be that you actually had to release completed games, because there was no easy way to send out updates.  Those were the days...
---
19 Rogues have 0 ability to stun.
---
Kek
---
Mid 20's semi-hardcore dudes LF competent, fun raiding guild.
---
Each of us are ex-competitive gamers working full-time jobs and managing adulthood responsibly. That said, we're pumped as hell for classic and want a solid home for the end game content. There are \~5 of us, some of which have been in top 5 US raiding guilds in the past, some which aren't as hardcore. We'd like to raid and be in one of the top prog guilds on the server (Especially for AQ40 and Naxx) with some PVP focus on the side.
---
If this sounds like it'd fit you well, feel free to add me and PM on discord. Enthozz#1593
---
I'm all for corpse runs as long as it doesn't bug out and put me at the wrong graveyard.  Nothing worse than dying literally next to a graveyard only to have your ghost appear all the way across the zone.
---
Get a plastic sleeve for that first sheet in the binder
---
So I actually did hemo swords on my 60 rogue alt back in the day. I remember it being very underwhelming. It was a “totally secret OP spec” when I heard about it. 
---
For leveling I would say you’re better off just leveling combat. 
---
But I also leveled a Paladin as holy so I understand the desire to do the non-most efficient route for the sake of fun or class fantasy. 
---
Do what makes you happy, but it won’t be efficient, it’ll be a slog for efficiency, but f you’re having fun it’ll feel faster (or at least “not so bad”).
---
I never minded Barrens runbacks much, since it’s a straight line and you can easily alt tab occasionally. Places like Ashenvale are the worst,  cause it’s almost as big as The Barrens, yet it’s all cliff faces and ledges, and dense forest.
---
There are horde zones, alliance zones, and contested zones. If you are in your own factions' zones, you can't be attacked unless you attack first, which will pvp flag yourself. If you go to a contested zone or enemy faction zone, you are pvp flagged immediately.
---
The first two zones you come across on a new character are usually your own factions zones. For example, Durotar, barrens, mulgore, tirisfal and silver pine are horde zones, so as a horde shaman you would be safe in those zones.
---
Durotar, mulgore, and tirisfal cap out around level 10.  Silver pine will cap out around 20, and Barrens around  level 30 I believe.
---
The problem you will have from 10 to 30 is that you will have quests leading you out to contested zones and you will run out of quests if you try to stay in the horde zones only. You could grind to 30 in the barrens and be safe there if the ganking gets too bad in the contested zones.
---
I remember when our DK main tank in WotLK reached 1 mil HP. Was ridiculous
---
Why choose one? I’m leveling 4 classes playing each until I run out of rested exp or become bored. Altaholic for life baby!
---
At 60 you'll be downranking so much that you can keep trucking with potions, before 60 combat won't last long enough for you to go oom, so you'll be drinking a lot. Once t2 content is out, druids and priests get an incredible amount of regen from their 3 set bonuses to the point where ooming is nigh impossible, and paladins/shamans at that point have mp5/crit to keep going for a good while too.  
---
The only interaction you do with the 5 second rule is cancel-casting in raids, where you queue spells but don't let them go off unless the target actually needs healing, so you cancel it if the heal is sniped, and you just end up regenerating some mana if enough time passes.  
---
Don't overly fixate on the 5 second rule - be aware of it but don't prioritize it or people will die while you still have mana.  
---
To directly answer your question though, iirc the ticks are "server pulse" based (1 tick every 2 seconds), the game was hardware limited which is why rogues regenerated chunks of energy instead of one at a time, so it depends on the server pulse for your mana return past the 5 second limit, this meant that the first tick would occur roughly between 5 and 7 seconds, meaning if as you mentioned finished a cast at the 6 second mark, theres a 50/50 chance of you not regenerating any mana, unless you paid special attention to the tick/pulse timer.
---
Y'all people are carebears, in Ultima Online when you died everything you had stayed on your body. Anyone could loot it without penalty, depending on your character's reputation.
---
Eve is the only modern game that still works that way.
---
Oof, praying for you
---
WoW was completely carebear about death when it came out. Prior to WoW we had games like Ultima Online where death meant you lost everything. It all stays on your body for anyone to loot, including mobs.
---
Cow. Rogues don't have a stun at 19 so the Orc racial isn't much use. You also won't have Aspect of the Cheetah yet so getting away from people won't be easy. The cow stun followed by a conc. shot will allow you to get some distance. 5% extra health is also handy.
---
Gouge is incapacitate right? There aren’t many stuns in the 10-19 bracket besides pally and maybe some priest/mage procs and i guess warrior charge unless thats not a stun too
---
I was on my second year of college when I started playing WoW - a few months later BC came out. I started as an orc hunter. I still remember my first time stepping foot in a "Contested Territory" on a pvp server and feeling like I should be watching my back at all times. It was this sense of danger and helplessness as a low level character wandering into this unknown land without the security of your faction. I'll never forget that feeling.
---
My theory? Because you know that in vanilla/classic its going to take a lot longer to build up your character and that makes it matter much more what class you pick.
---
In retail you can boost lvl your new char up to max lvl and mythic gear in weeks.
---
Azgalor ftw!
---
Now what are your thoughts on the regen for troll and bow perk and haste active
---
while not your direct answer... and not sure if your speed leveling or not... but really anything white or above you can just look up on wowhead during travel and see if it's a crafting reagent or quest turning for later. will probably be easier than making a list... or if there is something in particular you want to collect you can look it up now and find where it drops and add that location to your leveling route.
---
Since you bind w a s d what keys are you using for movement?
---
Fire mage for yuge pyros.
---
Being able to turn particles and spell detail up in 2006 gave you a huge advantage as a player.
---
With some of the people we had in my guild, AVR was almost a necessity though.
---
You can mock me, but if naxx is released and no new content is released for 2 years many many guilds will have it on farm. I am not talking about 1-2 months after release.
---
If it's red, it's dead.
---
Is duo leveling worth it? Thinking of rolling warr/priest with my friend. Is it too much of a hassle getting quest completion for two?
---
IIRC, hunter ammo stacked to 1000 in WotLK.
---
So I use a combination of Auto-run and both mouse buttons. Just what I find easiest :)
---
lt's not what people remember. It's that there was no Twitch/Youtube back then. Raid progression was not streamed. Guilds horded their techniques and cropped their kill pictures. Information did not flow freely to the masses. Yes, there are as many dumb people per capita today as there were 15 years ago but they will be on average much better because of the rising tide.
---
serious sam tho
---
Bow perk doesn't provide much value in PvP if I recall correctly. Health regen is nice and having extra haste on command is quite useful. For me though I still lean towards Tauren since the best way to beat a hunter is to get inside their deadzone and at 20 you don't have many ways to get people out of it and that stun might be your best option.
---
Was it really only 3ish gigs?
---
Wife and 2 kids...translation LF1M DPS BRD
---
Yeah, there's a mechanism where you occasionally get a free item upgrade on quest completion. i.e. a green becomes a blue, a blue becomes a purple. And since so many quests already give blues, the chance of a purple is pretty high. Like I said, I got two before 30.
---
Thats seems so far away on my keyboard!
---
I recall swords and boards, I think I was in it a short time. I know Brethren and Righteous dawn. But can't recall any in particular that i was in lol.
---
Warlock
---
No it's just broken. Take a look at this: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1046
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Good content, cheers for participating!
---
I would totally say Orc for the stun resist.
---
Makes me remember noob me trying to get into Dire Maul groups at level 18 and not understanding what was going on.
---
Really wish it would evolve into old ej forums.
---
All lvl 15+ areas have PVP activated.
---
15 has to be the minimum level olf the area for pvp to be activated, so even if the barren has 10-25 level range pvp is disabled for all of it.(I know there is pvp nearby the drazorfen entrances tho)
---
So the earliest pvp areas are : Redridge mountains(15-25), Ashenvale(18-30), Duskwood(18-30),  stonetalon (15-27), Hillsbrad(20-30)
---
Yes horde has a big advantage here. Horde areas are usually much larger and have a bigger level range so there are very few low lvl horde area with pvp activated. Barrens and sivlerpine don't have pvp activated.
---
Unlike alliance that can get camped very early in redridge and duskwood
---
Orc is probably the best to resist Charge, Bash and HoJ, this is largely a game changer when youre being dog piled by worse geared players, which happens a lot as a twink to be fair. Youre also quite a strong melee class so Blood Fury actually gets used pretty often. The pet damage is nearly irrelevant.
---
Tauren is actually a viable choice at 19. Since there arent that many stuns and youll be in melee a lot, War Stomp is actually a pretty good interrupt. The extra health is nearly irrelevant because most of your health is coming from +stam gear.
---
Troll actually isnt that bad, again, as you end up meleeing a lot and you have a large amount of health, you can actually get decent damage from Berserking. Still the worst of the lot though.
---
This is exactly the kind of thing I want in classic. I started in wrath so I missed out on all these shenanigans.
---
I cant remember if I've ever even spawned at the ratchet graveyard, lord knows it would have saved me a ton of time if I did
---
Never been a big fan of not having w and only moving with L+R mouse click. 
---
Tfw binding savory deviate delight.
---
White and above
---
Katana Zero
---
Haha, yeah I know that Wrath definitely bred a different kind of raider, with Naxx and ToC being two of the main raids before ICC. I also understand that ICC was way more mechanically complex than Molten Core, for instance, but within the context of the game, I believe if a group couldn't do the raid *without* AVR, than they shouldn't have been able to clear it. When the addon is that much of a necessity, it's an issue, you know what I mean?
---
Wicked claws
---
Meat to level up your cooking
---
for PVP, they have their pros and cons..  for pve dwarf is probably better because of stoneform..  the gun specialization doesn't matter because you don't get glancing blows with ranged weapons.
---
also for male dwarves I like the shooting animations better than the male might elf.
---
that being said I honestly don't think I've ever seen a female dwarf hunter... or their shooting animations..
---
for me making a dwarf hunter alt, I don't like the look of elves with anything but bows so any xbows or such I don't like the look of for an elf but will be fine on my dwarf.
---
Nice!
---
Shit poll....
---
mine is next to the 1, idk about foreign(relative to US) keyboard layouts and could be further away.
---
I made a note about that, with Everquest being more punsihing than Classic. Classic was definitely the "casual" MMO for it's time, but I think thats why it was so successful. 
---
If WoW death made you lose your character, then they would have to make death that much more rare. Nobody would PVP, dungeon, or raid, or perhaps Blizzard would have to make it that much easier to compensate for that added threat of permanent loss.
---
But it wasn't reduced to the point of where it is in the modern game. It was still a punishment as far as time spent.
---
I made one of these for Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town when I was but a wee lass lol.
---
Players who also are interested in vanilla wow will most likely be on this subreddit.
---
 I've met a lot of people who played a private server which had classic and claimed it still counted
---
1. Soul Shard Stack
---
2. pets / mounts tab
---
3. dual spec
---
4. arena
---
5. LFG tool (not LFD)
---
6. Achievements (with no rewards / no titles)
---
List in order important to least important.... and really just from a standpoint of QoL because I can live without all of them.
---
NE rogue 60. Tier 1 and tier 2 head. Pvped a lot but due to reasons I first understood today I only got to rank 8..excited for classic. Gonna make an ally lock even if ppl say it is a bad idea :)
---
Agreed completely.
---
Doesn't it always put you at the nearest one? I suppose it might be a little inconvenient if it puts you at the closest in terms of straight line distance, but theres all sorts of mountains and ridges in the way, so its like 3x longer.
---
No the memes are good. Keeps me engaged on the reddit after I've read every damn thread and discussion I could.
---
Same same
---
My account was banned for 6 months. I appealed every 15 days with the same answer every time. I logged back in, finally, on the 18 if this month. Had all my items and gear still, plus another 2.5 mil gold.
---
Sometimes, if they weren't world drops, like shadowfang, pod or assassin's blade.  It was really about drop rates, like those rogue shoulders from rfk were like 400g on my server. And petrospill leggings (for some inexplicable reason) were 300g.
---
Idk if keyboard turning or whatever that is called is worse
---
I would be so surprised if they add guild banks.. I don't think they will.. that being said I would love if they added a guild bank... don't need guild repairs or anything.. but just to avoid account sharing, transparency in what items are there and that the gm/banker isn't pocketing things, etc.
---
I know some people would probably be upset but while I'm not going to actively push for it.. I would not be upset at all if it gets added.

I dunno but I know there's a lot of websites out there with tons of ads and things so I am not bothered by Wowhead. They're unfortunately the norm, but at least UBlock Origin makes it run super smoothly. There's some websites I can barely use because it doesn't block enough.
---
You can just do it online also, buy 1 month game time and send them the code in the email
---
Brings me back to when I used to play on the server Lethon. Loved that dead server.
---
I’ll reroll if im going past 19 so no worry there. What are your thoughts on base stats and stat gain when only going to 19? Are those attributes more precious at 19 and worth considering?
---
I mean it's good against a lot of classes.
---
Human though. Wins just through perception usually
---
To each their own.  I like discussion and I like memes.  Personally, it is pleasant seeing something silly and then seeing something discussing the latest info.
---
Best of both worlds, imho.

something wrong?

Take away my bartender and quest helper and you might as well shoot me.
---
Health and mana regen is based off spirit. 
---
Trolls racial improves health regen by 10% and allows 10% of this improved amount to continue in combat.
---
I’ll never forget seeing the most geared prot warrior on my server in wotlk a few months after icc came out, had I think 76k or 86k hp, blew my fuckin mind hahah
---
Great, thanks for the advice.
---
@all, I guess a lot of players will take gathering profs early and mats will be super cheap at first then rise as time goes.
---
I think I’ll have Mining/Ench on my Lock and Herb/Tailor on my Mage seems to be the best option having gave it further thought.
---
I will then switch Mining for Eng and Herb for Qlfh at level 60. Plan to get level both alts in 7-8 days /played hopefully 8 weeks into classic they will be mad with my other life dedications.
---
For Racials, theyre honestly one of the  most equal splits in terms of class/race combos. In PvE, gun skill is  pretty irrelevent, NEs have a marginally larger base Agility while  Dwarves have Stoneform for occasional poison and bleed fights.
---
For  PvP, Stoneform is an awesome anti Rogue ability and can actually win  you the fight and Rogues are a class you generally have trouble with and are also a very common PvP class.  Shadowmeld however is also excellent for Hunters and allows you to  ambush others very easily. While the nerf doesnt let you get the full  Aimed shot cast off, it still lets you get the jump on people. A Hunter  that opens with an Aimed Shot will win like 90% of the time. The  disadvantage is obviously that you have to wait to ambush people, but it  provides you an enormous advantage when they run into you.
---
So its a strong anti-Rogue ability vs amazing ambush and defensive ability.
---
Ive actually played both, NE in retail and Dwarf on a pserver. I couldnt really say whats objectively better, but I do prefer NE, just feels good to get off those big Aimed Shots when PvPing.
---
I think it's more about a movement towards autonomy/self governance, rather than saying 'useful is bad'.         
---
           
---
Insisting on/forcing people to play a spec they don't want to because it's the "useful" one will be bad. But there will still be plenty of people that *want* to play the "useful" spec, and they'll self-select into the more serious guilds.          
---
            
---
Basically, if you're the shitlord chatting in /1 telling people they're bad for "not speccing at least X points in holy" or something, you're the "bad thing" in Classic.        
---
          
---
I personally feel like that's a bit of a boogeyman, though. That is to say, this imaginary internet tryhard dictating how people play is more a fabrication/exaggeration and there aren't going to be nearly as many of them as you might think reading online.
---
That didn't happen. Your memory is severely flawed.
---
It was a spare bind, and boy oh boy do I like being a pirate!
---
But it offsets "so-and-so is our best resto shaman, and he'll only go if we bring his mediocre mage wife to the progression runs."
---
Mine is right by the enter key aha  this \` is right by my number 1. I've also never considered binding it weirdly!
---
I was the GM of Swords and Boards :) was 14 or 15 at the time I think. Lol
---
On my pserver shamans the second most played Horse class among active 60s, by a comfortable margin
---
Original SM is easily in the top 5 of things I'm hype about for Classic. One of the first dungeons that actually required planned (or emergency) CC &amp; interrupts, alongside boss mechanics that forced everyone to pay attention to the fight. Can't wait to watch the carnage of those unprepared for BLADES OF LIGHT.
---
I agree Seduce took more skill to use, but how is fear shit? It was amazing in Vanilla because of how much damage you could do before it broke. Later expansions' Fear was a shadow of its former self!
---
Trolls are the best hunter. Bow spec is insane in PvE.
---
How can they be a real challenge???
---
They’re alliance....
---
True. I have had the same experience on pservers.
---
Even less relevant at 19, your stats are boosted so high, especially as an Agi class at 19, that the couple of extra points from your level make even less of a difference.
---
Rebuttal: No
---
There is a reason the the debuff limit occurred. Regardless of what you feel should change.
---
What? This is not true at all. Check any high population pserver and youll find that its the second or third played class on horde.
---
I prefer the orcs standing straight up over the hunchback style. (they give an option on retail)
---
Totally.
---
It felt like the real world in that at first it seems MASSIVE, then you get some flight points and your mount and it doesn’t seem “that” huge, then one day you wander into something like Jeadnaar and you realize that just cause the world doesn’t seem enormous when you’re flying over it doesn’t mean there’s not enormous depth and activity beneath the surface.
---
They exactly do not. They have separated data for horde and alliance and even races.
---
Not really, depends if you're literally going to be in lock step 1-60 though. Overall you would probably both save time versus leveling individually by yourselves, more so for the Priest though.
---
Get some stam, throw up corruption and siphon life on 3-6 dudes, tanky as fuck while tossing out insta cast shadowbolts.
---
BLADES OF LIGHT
---
And probably paid for your first mount lol
---
ya the ` is next to the one key, shift that key on mine and it is a tilde ~
---
Idk i though my warlock was pretty OP while leveling with sacrifice void and fear. I was almost never afraid of an engagement. At 60 your strategies really change though...

Means they are super fun to kill
---
Haha nice. I was an under geared warrior. I did OT for some guilds, until I got in a guild with friends, then was MT. Such a flood of memories can't even sort them out.
---
Now kith!
---
I never claimed it was easy, I said the Alpha and Beta portions will be shorter because it's an old game, not a new one.
---
That they've even *reached* the Alpha suggests they've had success already in porting the old game onto a new engine.
---
I wonder what the system requirements for classic will be
---
When BC hit you could only put the 30 Agi armor kits on BoEs, which is when Petrospill became the best legs at 29, over Triprunners. It wasnt until a later patch that they made Armor kits also have the 35+ requirement.
---
Sick site, clean, lots of content, and the live stream and discussion totally scratches the itch in waiting for launch. Good shit dudes.
---
Nice one thanks. I could read class guides from classes and specs I never intend to play, it’s just fun to me haha
---
If you're serious about raiding progression and securing an invite, then Dwarf Priest is a must. Fear Ward is favorable on at least one boss in every raid in vanilla (Onyxia, Nefarian, Bug Trio and all the way up to Gluth in Naxx). If you're just happy to immerse yourself in the RPG experience with your race, visuals and raid casually then pick what you love visually cause that'll keep you engaged with the game too.
---
https://ibb.co/VSNcbJk
---
Very nice
---
I think thats one of the beautiful aspects of the social element of the game. Sometimes you have to make those concessions with people, and you plan/barter around that idea. But if that wife, for example, is only okay with AVR, then that addon is brokenly OP. I look forward to these kind of relationships in Classic, in a bittersweet way.
---
Macros cannot make such decision for you
---
"If &gt; then" cannot be macro'd AFAIK
---
How does this make sense, the data would still go through the phone network
---
I'm guessing the same as vanilla. You should only need better specs if you opt for the new textures, shadows, etc.  
---
Vanilla servers you play on now can be played on a potato and run like butter.
---
No Idea. Was going to get a basic premade. Saw a couple at Costco for $650. Decent processors, 2gb video, 8gb ddr4. They should do just fine. Also found a 27" curved monitor for $179. It's been so long since using a PC, these prices seem really good.
---
That isn't what I said at all. Do you think straw man arguments make you seems more intelligent or less intelligent? 
---
&gt; If you're having fun why do you care what someone else says
---
This is what I am responding to. The selfish 'only my fun matters' mentality is how you end up never making friends in an MMO.
---
You can’t make a best-of list for vanilla o.o
---
Deadman's hand wasn't in vanilla
---
Very interesting question, and I really like where your head is at. I'm not sure if there was an 'if' function to lead into a castsequence command in Vanilla... 
---
We also have to remember that this will be running on the newer client, built back to the Vanilla state, which makes me think the old, more powerful and custom-able macro system will not be in place..
---
Long story short, I'm useless in answering this in regards to technicality, but I don't think you're able to. Someone please correct me, because I want this macro in my life...
---
I'm guessing most of the replies to this were too young to actually buy their own internet in 2007. Even in the American South you expected 1.5mbits minimum in small towns/rural areas by the time TBC launched.
---
Yes there were areas without a connection that fast, but he didn't say that it was faster than literally everywhere in the US or other countries. Just that it was slow compared to most.
---
Dialup was becoming rare in the US by like 2003-4.
---
&gt; I'm not sure why you are straw-maning my argument here.
---
I'm not the one who showed up with a stupid argument just for the sake of arguing.
---
If you want to play a Warlock that tanks, play one.  If it's fun to you, do it.
---
Maybe he means 100k IIRC (which I might not) you could get that with buffs.
---
Unfortunately, because my time in the game was so shallow, I just don't remember.
---
I have since repurchased it on Steam and I may play it this summer as my schedule loosens up.
---
Yes, you are the only one.
---
I think it would be a harmless change with no effect on actual game play. I'd be fine with it, but I also don't mind asking the person if they have a recipe/plan, and if not, thanking them anyways and moving on to the next crafter.
---
I kind of wonder if this is something from the old client that will sort of sneak through, that no one really thinks about haha :)
---
What on earth are you going on about? How do most guys do it "horribly wrong"? This just seems like trolling to me.
---
It runs on the 7.3.5 / 8.2 legion / BFA base. current retail would be a better benchmark.
---
everything
---
Overwatch
---
Meh, when advertising in chat people would usually just list their main enchants and when your looking for an enchanter you specify what your looking for so enchanters without that enchant wont bother replying "lf 25 agi to 2h" etc
---
Orgrimmar looked relatively deserted. And I'm not talking about all the dead bodies, there didn't appear to be many people there.
---
That's a pretty epic feat, though.
---
Can't say about the first one.
---
For rogue downtime, depends. Once you get Cheap Shot you start taking a lot less damage from mobs. Also because of stealth a lot of those quests where you had to go into the building/chapel/cave to kill some random dude are a joke because depending on other classes you have to kill respawns on the way out too. Also bandages were fine, you just need to level that as you level and hopefully kill humanoids that drop cloth.
---
As far as the last point, I think so. The fact that Blade Flurry, Adrenaline Rush, Sprint, Vanish, Evasion were on longer cooldowns were both fun and bad at the same time. You do decide when is the right moment and the rush of using them to win in specific cases was a big power appeal?
---
Bruh even alliance would kill gnomes on sight if they could.
---
The real challenge is for alliance to get to SM
---
I like your thoughtful comments here. The hows and whys of the game's changes in design over the years is a fascinating topic to me.
---
&gt; nothing speaking for it other than the universe, addons and unique graphic style
---
There's another important element that sets it apart: a big, active playerbase. Even to this day, retail still has more players than nearly any MMO (except maybe FFXIV?) and that does a lot for retention. If you still have friends playing WoW, that's a big incentive to participate. When WoW is where so many MMO players are, it makes sense to be there.
---
I don't think retail is actually as bad a game as it sounds like you do, but I do think inertia is a large part of what has kept it going. Early WoW was truly great and an insane number of people played it. Some proportion of those have stuck around partly because of familiarity, being attached to their characters &amp; the world, being in a guild they like, not wanting to start all over with a new game, etc. And even a small proportion of an insane number of people is still a lot, it turns out.
---
It's funny in a way. People say wanting classic is based on nostalgia. But it's probably more accurate to say that many people currently play *retail* largely because of nostalgia for what the game used to be.
---
“I’m a night elf Mohawk!”
---
“Uhhh, you’re a warrior.”
---
But why were they so expensive in vanilla?  I never saw a single twink wearing them.
---
On top of that, the person that killed you could cut up and loot your body parts.  I remember keeping a few heads of the more notorious pkers.
---
I’m actually pretty nostalgic for the whole.... WTS Enchants: Crusader 10g, Fiery Weapon 2g, etc... 
---
I liked seeing that personally. 
---
Anything that limits any potential social interaction for me is a no-no. I want it to feel as community like as possible. 
---
This specific request wouldn’t hinder any of that much... but still not classic.
---
It's still amazing to me how well these bosses run. They somehow never bugged out in these extremes.
---
I agree with Druid (and Paladin as #2 option), but felt that Hunter needed an honorable mention and do not get one.
---
You can’t AOE as a hunter, BUT, if you are doing more than running through a dungeon, their aspect of the pack is a godsend to lowbies
---
Aspect of the Pack is in Vanilla, right?
---
So... many... deaths from those gankers.
---
Rule 1: If you dont use E, S, D and F for movement you are doing it wrong. Gives you about 8 extra easy to reach keys and saves you a shit ton of those retarded shift+ stuff bindings.
---
A couple of players questioned my choice. "Why are you using a staff?" To which I responded, "Because it has higher dmg than my last weapon." Which was technically correct, but so so wrong.
---
It’s 100% a troll just to trigger people.  SWJ are like that.
---
They won’t. All world bosses got leashed eventually.
---
BUT you can still kite the elite green dragons that surround the various boss mobs. Bringing one to Org from Ashenvale and watching it’s AoE root obliterate lowbies and bank alts was always a good time.
---
I tried this, but it made me unable to reach CTRL without a strain, and alt was even worse.
---
They gave out WoW trials like AOL
---
Could you do this in classic? I can't recall correctly, but I was under the impression you needed to be in a certain range to get loot.
---
Alliance rogue for PVP? PVE is obviously Human for the weapon skill.
---
Gnome for slightly harder to target + escape artist? Human for perception? NE for stealth level (I swear this barely made a difference)?
---
*ultra instinct music intensifies*
---
I'd be 100% down with this. It's about as innocuous as the mail change in my opinion and doesn't change the way the game is played at all. I'd also be down with being able to see my guildes professions from the guild page.
---
What do the symbols (characters? Letters?) in the second panel mean?
---
Also great work.
---
You have hella small hands then.. Also ive never had to use more than 1 or 2 ctrl bindings, and I only used them for long CDs like bloodlust and whatever my class had.
---
I haven't ever tried but I know the FP from Auberdine flys there without a loading screen- is it possible to swim across to Teldrassil? If not seems your best bet would be to convince a higher level lock and 2 others to corpse walk themselves through Darnassus then summon you there. Tons of annoyance on that one though
---
Lol that’s great, you could also kite a bunch of elite demons to cause chaos as well.
---
What exactly does “Be There For Your Kids” mean in this context? Rush home an hour early from work every day and not have any time to himself then slowly lose his mind?
---
This is pretty baller. More please!
---
Only bit I disagree with is Frost being countered by FAPs in pvp.  Maybe I had a biased experience as I played as horde with some outstanding shamans when I was on mage.  They really took to purging to shutdown enemy paladins.  Stuff like freedom and FAPs got purged as fast as we could call them.  
---
Alliance frost probably would not typically have that high level of purge support, so likely do struggle against committed FAPers.
---
The reason frost mages skip improved arcane missiles is the ability is channeled so getting pushback only hurts the mana efficiency and not the DPS of using it.  It does terrible damage and scales poorly as well, so no one ever cast it as a viable alternative to frostbolt.  You only cast it when there is literally nothing else that will work or you just need the 1 or 2 ticks of the spell and it faster then waiting a full 2.5 for a frostbolt.  It was also bugged back in the day and would continue through vanish or someone losing, but in those situations you shouldn't expect a lot of pushback.  
---
I do agree with elemental being a great spec.  On live after the mage patch I mostly played elemental with my time before the mage patch split between pom-frost(mostly for AB) and deep frost(mostly for WSG).  Elemental was viable before the mage patch but you also lost arcane explosion and evo.
---
Yes. Also, it was a hunter that leveled me to mid 40s and then just couldn't keep up with the hits because you couldn't hit them with a bow in melee, if I remember correctly. A fury specced warrior got me to 54 and then I did a lot of grinding for the rest
---
So edgy.
---
I remember a few situations where I died in southern barrens, when there was a graveyard right there near the road between the dwarves and the quillboars, and I'd get respawned at Camp T or further.

I'd be willing to bet that most players from WotLK and on have never noticed or used the individual repair hammer and have always just clicked "Repair All".  Back when you often had to decide which armour pieces you wanted to repair if your funds were low enough.
---
Oh I would be surprised also, but it's one of the only QoL changes I'd be okay with.  The only other thing I'd be cool with is being able to shift click items to search the AH in the default frame
---
Shout out to that Tauren warrior who gave me 10g to respec when I was level 13. It’s been almost 15 years and I still remember you and I hope you are ok and join classic again!
---
Awww yeaaahh GW factions baby!
---
Good to hear. I was starting to get nervous that I wouldn’t be able to compete without high end raid gear since I know full well I won’t be able to grind out the rank 12+ PVP gear.
---
Palm piro mage is probably the most bursty
---
Thanks for the comment. I think maining a Mage and then having a Druid alt makes the most sense for me. Mage is my favorite class fantasy and it's a playstyle I know I enjoy - I love Blinking everywhere too much to play anything else, I think. Druid lets me heal and presents me with multiple playstyles if I get bored of Mage, and it's a class I've never played much before, so it works out as an alt. Thanks for the help!
---
I loved coming across mangled remains and using Anatomy skill to try and decipher what killed them, to see if a PK was nearby haha.
---
Oh, and fuck The Dead Presidents PK guild! I got ganked by The Dread Lord Richard Nixon so many times.
---
Apparently he got stuck in there for a couple hours until a gm removed it so thats fun.
---
That’s not what this is. This is just to help people make smart, informed decisions about their class and race selections in a concise fashion. Pretty much every race has a class that they are the best of their faction at (except for Tauren, but they are the only Druids so no big deal). If the population was split in percentages according to the rankings of classes and races as seen on this list it’d make a pretty much ideal server population.
---
The memories of tossing curse of recklesness as a warlock on mobs closing to the end of their life and preventing them from running away.
---
You're definitely not alone, withdrawal is an accurate description of what i'm feeling right now. It's been rough ever since i started trying to lay off pservers lol.
---
Diablo 3. I wanted to play another Blizzard game and it’s very fun and scratches the itch for me more than other games.
---
My parents wouldnt pay for WoW when I was 14, and I wasn’t about to spend all of my lawn mowing money on it. Made me the GW lover I was. When I turned 15 and got that job at CVS though? Every push of the brand new touch screen registers was practice for my raid rotation
---
&gt; ... nobody seems capable of making a good UI since they all hand it over to the art team to draw fancy fantasy bezels rather than UX researchers.
---
100% true, and it boggles the mind.
---
As for combatting trivialization, it all boils down to what the developers allow their addon APIs to accomplish. Plenty of things in WoW's interface API are inaccessible to unofficial addons. If Blizzard didn't want people to use a threat meter, they wouldn't publish threat values to the API. If they didn't want there to be a quest marker on the map, they wouldn't offer the capability to modify the map in any way.
---
For example, you can't make an addon to alert you when a resource node is nearby, even though the marker is on the minimap, there's no means for an addon to get this information. I should know, because I was trying to acquire or make an addon that would alert me when an alchemy cauldron was nearby while I was out world questing in BfA zones but found out through the addon developer community that it's impossible. For the same reason rare spawns alerts used to have to do hackish things like watch NPC cache to see if a new ID became known, until Blizzard closed that down and added in the Star icon (vignette) which serves as the only sanctioned means by which addons can determine (without mouse-over/targeting it) that a rare NPC is nearby. Which is why it doesn't work for any rare NPC prior to MoP.
---
It's simple enough to provide the means for customizing the UI via addons and not allow them to trivialize things, it's all about how much or little the developers decide are something an addon can do within the constraints of the sandbox. With WoW specifically, just with how LUA works at all, the developers have to purposely expose functions and variables to the LUA engine. They can also constrain non-official interface elements from accessing certain things while allowing others.
---
I'd still say that "no addons" isn't a selling point, it's a cop out from having to do the legwork to offer a safely extensible UI.
---
Miss DDO, was a phenomenal game
---
As someone who started at the tail end of Vanilla (literally right after 1.12 came out, so only several month away from Burning Crusade), the problem that I have is I’m constantly mixing up BC and Vanilla skills/talents. I kept thinking Pallies had consecrate as a learned skill (but in Vanilla, it’s actually somewhat in the middle of the holy skill tree) kept thinking hunters have disengage, and kept thinking humans had “every man for himself”
---
Other than that, everything is as I remember it. I do have a lot of “Oh! That’s right! There was THAT in Vanilla!” moments, and sometimes I confuse at what level you unlock certain class quests for skills (poisons or lockpicking for rogues), but for the most part it’s just the way I remembered it. I don’t REALLY get blindsided much, and if I do, it’s actually a welcome thing - makes the game feel new ☺️
---
I had a fight as, as a pally, with a shaman in UC at 60 in t.5 that just didn't end. Even when he pulled the elite dinosaur on me. We parted ways and I finished of the dino
---
Pick what you'd like to counter more easily. Escape artist is great against mages which can turn the tides in your favor. Stone form is also excellent for winning mirror matchups (Imagine being immune to Blind) or warrior bleeds, serpent sting etc. Human for getting the opener on another rogue. I don't know enough about NE Stealth level, but I can't imagine it competing with the utility of the other races.
---
You have to March all of them to the nearest bank. Day one is a mass pilgrimage of level 1s.
---
Great thank you, didn’t mean to offend or be ignorant. Just not a big fan of the art (which is usually well done).
---
The major difference between that and now is the sheer amount of warriors. They really shifted the meta game on pservers
---
It takes a lot of dying, but you can do it.  You have to plan your boat ride so you rez as the boat is leaving, far enough from the NPCs so they don't murder you, then jump off into the water when you get close to the dock.
---
That, and the wonked flight paths is something I wouldn’t mind changing. I’ll never shout at Blizzard about t, but it would probably make me happier.
---
It's always fun to have a good discussion.
---
It's true, the momentum WoW achieved was one of a kind when compared to other games of its genre. I think Blizzard is in a unique position when it comes to their playerbase compared to many other games and that's part of the challenge with making the game good. I'm also one of the players you mention, I keep coming back, even if only for a month at a time, to enjoy the familiarity.
---
You're right that I'm a bit bitter over what retail is at the moment, so I'll paraphrase my own reply from a while back: I don't feel like I'm a shaman in a fantasy world, I feel like I'm a guy pressing buttons on keyboard. In other words, playing retail feels arbitrary and made up. Of course, every game -is- arbitrary and made up, but the trick is to make player feel like it isn't. It might be burnout, but there's several games I've sunk thousands of hours into and still have a blast playing, so I attribute the above to the game feeling meaningless. 
---
Honest opinion, if blizzard changed just one thing about retail, retroactively - world and systems going obsolete from expansion to expansion - I think I'd stick to the game for far longer.

I really enjoy the memes. I mean, we're talking about a game after all. We shouldn't be taking ourselves too seriously. There's still a good amount of discussion threads as well; sometimes even taking place in the comments of memes. If anything, the memes serve as an efficient and tongue-in-cheek method of bringing up a topic that ultimately WILL lead to meaningful discussion.
---
And, lastly, they're just fun. We should be having fun. I say, keep it up!

You should be able to appeal. Just explain calmly and descriptively.

I wouldn't mind it now days, but back then it was terrible for me. After many of us complained to a friend who worked at our ISP, we finally got them to stop blocking that type of traffic.
---
Look forward to seeing you in there! Don’t spoil the game too much from videos, BfA, or Private servers or anything like that. If I can give some advice, let your dungeon groups know you’re new and open for tips. Most people are pretty friendly, though I’m not sure what the launch community is gonna be like.
---
Expectations of players in 2019 are higher then expectations of players in 2004.
---
In 2004, the game launched with half the specs being complete and utter garbage. In 2019, the game launches with three garbage specs, out of 36, and the take-away is that Blizzard balancers need to be drawn and quartered.
---
I'm not offended and this is a commonly held sentiment. I apologize for my flippant "facts are hard" comment.
---
If you're interested in what r/WoW has to offer beyond art and crap level memery, then I recommend sorting by flair (which is easy in the redesign) or filtering out flair (which is relatively easy using Reddit Enhancement Suite, or several third party apps, such as Reddit Is Fun). It *really* helps cut down on the amount of fluff that you see.
---
I still remember taking a trip to Gnomeregan the night before the 2.0 Honor System changes. A friend and I just stood in the uninstanced section killing (and cooking and eating) gnome NPCs to lure out the gnome PVPers.
---
Dropped from Stone Guard to First Sergeant, but it was worth it.
---
Shout out to Zebogo (troll shaman) and Sweaglenodes (gnome rogue) on Cenarion Circle from Oskar!
---
Looks like you replied to the wrong guy!
---
That’s why they gave gnomes Escape Artist. They knew Gnomes would be the most murdered class, so they had to balance it out.
---
A macro like 
---
/cast frostbolt rank11
---
/cast frostbolt rank10
---
/cast frostbolt rank9
---
all the way down to 2 should do the job since first line has priority.
---
yeah.. hopefully a nice AH addon comes out for that kinda stuff..
---
it would be possible to addon a gbank "sorta" depending on how you set it up if the addon maker let you upload an export of the inventory and have it viewable on the web.
---
O man thanks! This was my only distraction/reading material as a kid during maintenance day.
---
getting a new PC at some pt b4 classic launches. found a decent pre-built i liked but in no rush to get it. my current still runs everything fine after just a vid card and ram upgrade, but its been 8 years. Thinking its about time.  
---
Just yesterday got myself a new mouse, one with all those buttons on the side. always wanted to try one and saw the logitech one was ~$30 so figured might as well grab it. Not a big investment if i end up not liking it. heh  
---
No SO to play with though, jealous. i do have the perfect lapdog though, so at least i have some company while gaming.  
---
Have fun man.
---
It’s an advantage against casters and a disadvantage against melee as ele, and yeah a disadvantage for Resto.
---
Allrighty, time to pack my bags and go home.
---
I know they never leashed Anachranos. I would take him all the way to Orgrimmar when I was bored in Wrath.
---
Master race? Umm you couldn't even hold your own city against Kobolds. So far from master race it's insane lol.
---
Thug thug
---
IIRC the camp T one didn't even exist for the first few patches of the game.
---
Man I wish I could get that... I just have ATT uVerse (FTTP) but the max is 10. I’m not even in a rural area. 15,000 people in the city limits and I live in the downtown area.
---
I was 21 with 2 kids, wife and in the NAVY, without all those deployments and stupid terrorists I can finally enjoy WoW!
---
Elder scroll online. I played for the first time ever in april 2019 and i like the feeling of being a noob and discovering a mmorpg. can't wait to play calssic tho
---
I just started on there to kill time. Leveling a belf pally.
---
DH's are the worst thing they added to Classic. Especially since most of the Allaince NPC's are DH and the horde ones aint.
---
It's seems a bit odd to me to be so concerned with premade level PvP when that is extremely rare in Vanilla. If you take a typical PvP server I'd guess only about 20-30% at most people regularly PvP at lvl 60. It would be very optimistic to say 10% of those people regularly do premades - so we're down to 2-3% of those people. Finally, at least half of those people doing premades are just doing it for easy honor by farming pubs - if they meet another premade they will usually forfeit and try to dodge or just not queue if they keep running into other premades.  
---
I get premade is the '1%' hardcore that's it's fun to theorycraft around, but in every Vanilla community from 2005 to Nost it's been a very niche thing that really only a scant handful of people are interested in on a server. So yeah, you're probably right that ele mage is more powerful than frost in a world where every warrior has 2 dispellers and everyone's chugging FAP and mages get heals - but for the other 95% of mages that don't do competitive premades frost is far superior. You aren't getting heals, or peels. People will notice you don't have ice barrier and you just die.
---
agree
---
Yes? This proves that Shaman is the second played class for horde.
---
Take rogue for example, 154k( both sides combined)
---
Divided by 2 to get only horde side = 77k.
---
However horde is 85 % of the alliance size on this server (538/617k) = 0,85 x 77 = 65k
---
65k is less than 68k, which is the absolute amount of shamans, since the faction distribution doesnt affect.
---
Almost positive ratchet didn't have a gy in Vanilla.
---
I don’t care too much. I do like the more social aspect of having to ask people what enchants they have. Makes me feel like I’m talking to the trenchcoat dude who may or may not have what I need.
---
Plus then you can avoid the flood of shitty low effort memes that plague this sub ever since the "omg beta is coming" subscriber increase.
---
but they asked so kindly that they dont take their candle
---
That's fair enough. It's just a curious question into if it can be answered! Save the extra odd keybinds.
---
Playing with my wife this time, a new player. I'm excited to join her as she discovers Azeroth for the first time. Have a mid 2014 MacbookPro I'm refurbing for her, getting us mice / headsets / etc. I think I'm going to play a shaman and she's expressed interest in warrior which I think will work out great
---
Good movies, good games, great childhood
---
Heroes of the storm
---
I think you mean shield slam not shield bash but yeah. I do wonder about the people who only ever talk about sunder when tanking without ever mentioning revenge...
---
i just to help friends all of the time tanking in dungeons even in low level ones but i never was able to get a high amount of money for my epic mount until a couple of friends gave me the money to buy my epic mount... to this day i still remember that u\_u that kind of stuff is what make me wants to play wow classic again :3 never happened again after classic
---
Quality content.
---
Another thing to remember is that pservers are patch 1.12(and classic is too). Enhancement shaman had quite a few nerfs early on actually, so maybe these sick videos were recorded the nerfs
---
Excuse me but Nightfall exists, so your opinion is wrong. /s
---
Factions had a lot going for it, but more than anything else the Jade Sea was one of the most interesting zones I've ever seen in any game ever.
---
I wouldn't worry about it. The Classic team is very small, I'm sure. And all the changes they actually made to the game are there to make it run with the lowest possible overhead.
---
Classic will not be this "massive thing" a lot of people here believe/hope but it'll be a decent success. Actually running it will cost Blizzard close to nothing.
---
My prediction is that the Classic team will move on to Classic TBC (and so on). It's a no brainer for Blizzard. Relatively small investment, large payoff. Once all expansions available to play a lot of people will basically never unsubscribe. :)
---
I will upgrade ram in the wife's PC. No fancy mouse desired, maybe a couple macros. A lapdog is a priceless companion for gaming, greatly decrease rage moments.
---
Did you know that you don't have to post something. 
---
Posting nothing is better than posting shit memes most of which aren't even related to classic.
---
I don’t think they could redesign Outland without flying. Or Isle of Wuel Danas without dailies, etc... BUT... I think there is wiggle room for #changes with BC and Wrath. An obvious one for Wrath is making a hard 5 man option and limiting LFD to 15-60. 
---
But making it all level 60 and cutting out core features would just be an awful experience. BC did a lot of things perfectly, and I want to appreciate them in the way the were, more or less. 
---
The difference is now we still have Classic Vanilla to play to get that world PvP Azeroth buzz. And we will have BC and Wrath to give us what was great about them.
---
Risk of Rain 2 and Sekiro are my current favorites. Dabble into some Rocket League occasionally.
---
zug zug
---
Ah, gotta find Kazzak gets kited to SW.
---
I think people can be too hopeful when they think there’s a perfect mash of every xpac. It would just make for one diluted awkward experience, and not 3 separate experiences that are great in their own ways.
---
There was a hunter on my sever named landshark who lead a large guild that got disbanded by a troll pretending to be an alt of his, he ninja looted items from time to time, sucked at his class and was a generally an asshat.
---
A common one I see is no flying, for example. I don’t think they can really do that without making drastic changes to the world. And the end result would be a hack job imo. I think there are welcome changes, but people paint with *way* too broad strokes with their opinions, imo.
---
Lol thought it was a post to shit on Horde characters. Pleasantly surprised.
---
If I play classic this is going to be me. Wasted so much potential gold vendoring white/green items. Especially rare ones like the different spider silks and obscure crafting ones.
---
Oh man, that's going to be a blast watching her reactions. "What's that silver circle thing around that Hogger guy?" I remember when they patched in weather, had a beautiful rain in Elwynn forest. 
---
Warr/sham will be a nice combo for sure. We are probably doing druid/warr again, more than likely same names and all lol.
---
I kill all gnomes.  Because whenever I'm merciful and don't gank them, they wait until I'm fighting 4 mobs and then gank me.
---
https://youtu.be/6n3pFFPSlW4
---
That macro would only try to cast rank 11 FB, even if you don't have enough mana for it
---
My GF has never been into gaming but I recently bought all the parts to a new gaming PC and had her do most of the hardware install so she could learn what each part is and how they fit to the mobo/case. She is very excited to play because she knows playing classic wow at launch is an experience she will only get once in her life.
---
Oh I see, I didn't realize you meant the amount of attending raiders.
---
No 3% isn't the entire world but it sets precedence, why should the ones doing more than double put in the effort in doing so when having an output a third of what you're doing is acceptable as well? That's when you get either drama or a performance reduction.
---
Well. I’ll just get on my sky gol... oh yeah
---
Inverted knee cap night elf or vogue posing night elf? Does it really matter?
---
Depending on faction it’s not really that far. dwarves gnomes orcs and trolls are all really close to the AH cities.
---
Would love to see more classic art
---
Glad you approve.
---
Frost mages weren't OP in Vanilla. They had superior control &amp; some high-burst builds, but they paid for this by dying *A LOT*. It was TBC that gave them superior survivability and instant cast spam to make up for all the Vanilla deaths. This hurt game balance IMHO.
---
Yes it is a once thing. From opening video at character creation, to aggro from 3 miles away because you do not belong in that zone, first time seeing a member of opposing faction, that first HK...man oh man.
---
3 miles is 4.83 km
---
&gt;oho you're approaching me?
---
&gt;I have to get closer if I'm going to loot your shoulders
---
I am glad that I found it and was able to share it.
---
Wow that's nostalgic!
---
I would heavily recommend even those who plan on skipping most dungeons in favor of leveling speed to do a full SM clear. There's nowhere else like it, and a full quest run is glorious XP/items anyway. Perfect dungeon to be the iconic mid-level Vanilla instance imo
---
They don't even have chairs!
---
I never played Vanilla WoW until Nostalrius in 2016. Enjoyed it more than any other iteration. It's not just "nostalgia" or whatever, it's legitimately good. The game has soul.
---
The only addons I'd like to see are UI cosmetic ones.
---
Imagine nerds raiding without KTM/Omen
---
Is this a motherfucking World of Warcraft reference?
---
When making the decision, start from a broad sweep and narrow down as you go. Keep in mind that when comparing pros and cons, the goal isn't to pick something with no cons, but with either the least amount of cons, or the cons you can deal with.
---
First Question: PvP or PvE Server
---
Second Question: Horde or Alliance
---
Third Question: Tank, Heals, or DPS
---
If Tank: Warrior, Paladin, or Druid
---
If Healer: Priest, Paladin, Druid, Shaman
---
If DPS: Rogue, Mage, Hunter, Warlock, Warrior (or a lovable meme spec which is also fun)
---
Then pick your race and gender. Good to go. It also helps in addition to a main character to identify and choose your main Alt as well. Having an alt makes deciding on a main easier because you have less of the "I'm missing out" feeling.
---
Good Luck!
---
Imagine the servers being ddos    crashing to hell.    Having insane population because 300k twitch viewers.  And u wasted your vacation.     
---
I dont even have any vacation to take for it.  But if I were taking time off it would be a week after release.   Long enough for blizz to get its shit together and short enough that the people ganking me wont be lvl 60
---
This is awesome dude sick angles!
---
Dark souls with some mods

&gt; I'm strawmanning you.

---
&gt;I can't comprehend your argument
---
Pick one.
---
I'm not comparing paladin tanks to warlock tanks.
---
Why are you ignoring the bulk of my argument?
---
Its not a waste of hours if youre having fun
---
Your next line will be "Lok'tar Ogar!"
---
Just call customer support or open a ticket instead of posting on reddit about it? lol
---
Cleared full AQ40 and Instructor Rezuvious in Naxx here. Probably only ever flasked when badly stuck on progression.
---
Never really even knew about world buffs til the private server scene. 
---
I feel like going full world buffs/flasks/consumes when first starting out (MC/BWL etc) gives a huge head start as they are mainly static stat boosts (as opposed to % which rely more on gear), and in some way take out some of the fun/challenge out of raiding.
---
Just my opinion tho.

Unexpected turn of events
---
I wasn’t posting for help. Just thought it was funny my account gets suspended one month after summer classic release
---
WoW's current design philosophy is "make everyone feel like winners, even the losers".
---
Classic WoW design philosophy was if you sucked at the game you didn't get to experience end game content. This encouraged people to "get better at the game" and actually LEARN their characters. If you sucked, you didn't get rewarded, that alone made me want to get better at the game. Some people are lazy casuals though and don't care about being good, they just want epics so they feel like they're special.
---
Thank you for the advice everyone. I more so was posting because I thought it was hilarious my account was suspended until one month after Classic summer release. 
---
I have already submitted a ticket
---
The death run gives you time to think about what you did wrong, so you can learn from your mistake. It makes you think twice about trying risky stuff the next time.
---
You had a phenomenal pc back then to raid in that resolution
---
To be fair, Orgrimmar being being an ugly shithole compared to Stormwind and Ironforge makes perfect sense. In the lore of the game, both Ironforge and Stormwind have existed for hundreds (maybe even thousands, I don't remember) of years. They are fully fleshed out and have grown organically. 
---
You literally build Orgrimmar in WC III. In the sense of the world, it's a brand new city for a race that has been driven from their home and is starting from scratch. It's Stormwind when it was first built. A slightly larger village.
---
&gt; I watch streams and YT all day long 
---
You really need to get out of the house. Go see your friends, or get some friends. Do something unrelated to wow and it'll pass the time easier.
---
This. The time you invest to hit 60...DAYS of your life on a fucking video game 🤪
---
The best healer is a warrior with his bandages if you ask me
---
It was indeed a tactic... in torture.
---
We asked for classic and that's what we're gettin.
---
It’s not a gift card, it’s a balance on your Blizz account which can indeed be used for your sub :)
---
The bulk of your argument is stupid, that's why.
---
You did compare warlocks to paladins, by introducing warlocks into the paladin argument.  You are effectively saying "Tanking as a Paladin is as stupid as taking as a Warlock!"
---
The fact that you're arguing at all shows just how stupid your argument is.
---
OP says: "I really like tanking as a Paladin, should I tank as a Warrior instead?"
---
Me: "No, because you like tanking as a Paladin."
---
You: "What if I want to tank as a Warlock?"
---
Me: "Do it then."
---
You: "Why are you ignoring me!"
---
90%+ of the people here will never be high end raiding.  Blizzard has said that most people never even make it to 60.  So why should he decide on what to play based solely on if he can tank raids as the main tank or not?
---
Play what you like and stop worrying about being elite, unless what you really really want to do is be elite.  But then, if you were planning on being elite, you wouldn't be asking if the second best tank was right for you.
---
Your argument is stupid.
---
People sigh when you enter a room
---
The balance remains on your blizz account and can be spent on anything, it doesn’t expire.
---
To expand on why it's called that, there used to be a 32-bit CPU a long time ago called the Intel 8086. Later CPUs that were backwards compatible with that CPU's instruction set (such as the Intel 80386, and later the Pentium, Celeron lines, along with compatible AMD processors) are said to use the x86 architecture.
---
At some point, a 64-bit of x86 was developed, called x86_64 (sometimes confusingly called x64).
---
I say something similar and get downvoted while you have 50 upvotes. Lol this sub.
---
Confirmed works!
---
Also you can get Battle.Net cards to get balance at 80%-85% at /r/GiftCardExchange sometimes.
---
If you think bfa is a grind gl in classic.
---
Gnome are adorable. Especially the ones with pink pigtails.
---
They're sound effects that say "do do do" (pronounced like dough) It's in katakana.
---
Healbot was so much better after the vanilla API was gone and this is how it will be classic. It didn't auto heal for you like you're describing. Your raid frames just because [modifier] clickable. So left click targets the player, shift left click is renew, right click is shield, etc. So not auto healing but eliminates having to select raid members and then cast the spell.
---
There is a big mix of the type of harpies, 4 or 5 different ones (casters and melee), and some of them can be very problematic for certain classes. They are also densely populated and some have large paths. This can easily lead to large pulls and unexpected adds.
---
I recall some of them cast a wind spell that acts similar to sleep, and that can be an issue for pet classes (it dazes you or your pet for a long durtion). The basilisks also have a daze or a stun that they perform.
---
But if you can solo pull off to the side somewhere and your class can handle it then it is a fantastic grinding spot.
---
It could be possible, that it was a 0 less. Was quite a long time ago
---
&gt; every quest is the same layout, kill, gather, boss, and talk
---
I'm excited for classic and all, but this pretty much describes what classic quests are too, when you boil it down.
---
Has anyone discussed sharding yet?
---
I'm game. I'll heal. Hope you like Mark of the Wild.
---
The only prerequisite for success in classic is time, get of your high horse. It’s in no shape or form a hard game.
---
&gt; +5 bows is useless 
---
You use Rhok for a long time until you get Chromag Xbow actually so not entirely useless. Yes I realize it's under 3.0 speed it still sims better if you clip the rotation though. Just facts.
---
Let's you sacrifice some hit for crit if you get the right gear
---
Gnome, you get a boost with engineering and escape artist will save your life in both PVP and PVE.
---
Also pop the world enlarger and a noggin fogger and you are almost impossible to target.
---
For binding in EQ, your bind spot was essentially your Hearthstone location. So you bound in a city (or if you were a caster wherever) and when you died you spawned there, no matter what, no matter where you were.
---
Corpse runs were brutal back in the day.
---
Troll warriors are pretty badass
---
My sweet summer child...
---
...I didn't either. Halfway through AQ40, but only raided a little there. Cannot *wait* to do them.
---
(Also secretly hoping they do TBC next and I can do BT, never did it but my friends loved it)
---
i play too many shooters to move off of W A D.
---
Everyone go shaman just to spite this post. That's what I think. And every one buy a 21 button mouse to deal with all the totem hotkeys.
---
"Oh? You're approaching me?"

Unless you like Dwarf aesthethics, Shadowmeld is too good to pass up as a Hunter imo. It's such a cool and fitting racial, it adds so much to your gaming experience as a whole. Check out this other reddit thread to understand what I mean:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a8429t/the_tables_have_turned/
---
And even if you don't want to gank people, the skill is super useful to solo instances (avoiding patrols!).
---
You know, I still have severe issues choosing a class, there are so many pros and cons involved and it feels I always have to consider dozens of factors. But if the question is which race as an Alliance Hunter? Nelf, mega no-brainer with sugar on top.

He has strafe bound and has a toggle W key essentially and the L/R mouse move. His is a legitimate set up that numerous higher skilled retail players use, at least.

Keyboard turning and back pedaling are just bad forms of movement.

Let us know how much gold you end up with! I had this happen and I got all the gear back they had melted, but didn't get to keep all the gold they had farmed
---
Ahh, I can hear your screams of outrage of not finding Mankriks wife already. 
---
I envy you :)
---
i used an undersized bag for all of TBC and wrath because a guildmate had made it for me during vanilla
---
Thank you for the advice here. I’m not opposed to playing a paladin aside from the fact that I’d have to go alliance. I think I’d agree that with the amount of time I can commit to playing each day (2-3 hours) and with my intent to mainly PvP, I’ll need a class that is dependent on gear as little as possible. I’m open to healing on the horde side. Would you say the shaman or mage are good choices, all things considered?
---
Rocking a bit of Diablo 2 now. It's still a pretty solid game honestly.

Hi, /u/Stimeroles

its gone to crap now, but LOTRO was a pretty good mmo at launch

Druids and Warriors are Viable.

Viable /= Best but means good enough.

Carry on :)

Do you though?

Tremor timing is in the same boat though. Drop it if you see a priest running towards you.

As it should be. MMO's should be time sinks.

So basically LFR for Discord, but a gimmicky, hacky version of it.

The rabbit hole of insanity goes deep.
---
Well, I stopped playing WoW back in late MOP. Recently, I was curious about returning to the game as I was really missing it. It seemed like BFA was doing really poorly and I decided that maybe I shouldn't get back into it.
---
I wanted to reaffirm this idea so I watched a bunch of review videos on youtube about BfA where I stumbled upon an Asmongold video where he talked about the current state of WoW. 
---
In such video he mentioned WoW: Classic really briefly like "Now that Classic is announced..." and I immediately start furiously Googling for more information.
---
Thus, leading me here, typing this comment.
---
I think the difficulty is that no class has it all because they are all genuinely so different instead of the homogenisation of classes in retail. You have to give something up. There’s no class that’s quick and fun to level, has multiple different viable specs,  easy to gear, lots of utility and is always in demand for raids or dungeon groups. You have to actually work out what matters most to you.
---
This is so interesting to me when i talk to people who want PVE servers because getting ganked impedea their efforts.
---
My take on it is that the fear of getting ganked is something that enhances your experience in the game. Wether or not you enjoy pvp or ganking.
---
yep, im as excited for classic as anyone, but there really isnt left to talk about.
---
Can you even walk to Darnassus from Org in 20 minutes?  Now factor in all the deaths.

Haha this made me laugh, its P.O.M. pyro, presence of mind + pyroblast to make pyro an instant cast.

Hah! Out of curiosity, does that word start with an "f", "s", or an "r"? Could be any of those.

Well I’m running a second account just to be that asshole running the economy. Also hoping to snipe edgemaster handguards when they first show up on the AH. I’ve found some interesting ways to make gold from the AH pre lvl 60. One is 100% profit on the server in testing it on but I managed to hit 20g at lvl 20 with a warrior and a bank alt. I’m hoping with a dedicated account I could make more on a fresh server.
---
I swear to God I typed "pom"
---
yea brendan
---
Lots of people advising Druid but really you need a class who can resurrect if boosting lowbies. They are awfully prone to getting inconveniently squished.
---
yea brendan, u wanna help or u want to fight? 1v1 outside IF noob

Other than joana no other players really spring to mind. Huntard is not a meme i guess.

how many times you gonna reply to me and delete your comment
---
Do you know how many friends I made in SM Arm, willing to come and heal it?
---
Many. Groups full of Warriors/Paladins/Shamans willing to let me take the greens to D/E in exchange for Healing/not looking for Arm loot.
---
we had a guy in my guild that would let his kid dps for him in raids sometimes. we knew when the kid was playing for two reasons:
---
never spoke in vent
---
dps was better
---
Shamans and paladins are popular classes for their factions, I don't think that should be news to anyone.   
---
      
---
Exactly how popular is hard to say, there's a big difference between a poll months out from release on a forum and what will actually happen at launch. Then you have what classes people roll compared to what class population is like at lvl 60 6 months in.
---
I still use that in CS and all other games really, its never ever been a problem for me, you will get used to it fast.
---
Yes, the macro's cannot check whether or not you're able to use a skill and will try to cast it regardless
---
Haha, Ventrillo also a blast from the past. Classic brings back way to much memories
---
??? It polls literally ***dead*** last out of all possible classes.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbK5Fkms0Z4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbK5Fkms0Z4)   (25:54)
---
This is from a 15k+ poll.
---
\&gt;  You have **0.16%** chance to get both bindings in **1 run** *(0.04\^2*\*)\* 
---
This happened to me in 2006. I was the MT/GM and we got both bindings in one run on the same day that I completed the last transmute on the 100th Arcanite Bar. We killed Thunderaan that night and it was glorious.
---
Sadly, this wont happen to me again in WoW: Classic. :(
---
we can keep going lemme give u a few more notifications

Least favorite was running completely out of quests in the Badlands and having zero direction

---
you can't use it to pay for a "subscription" but rather you purchase 30 days of game time for $14.99 in the Blizzard Shop, essentially a digital version of the old pre-paid game time cards you'd get at the store
---
Even Dwarves?
---
God I love SM it was so sad when it just became completely irrelevant...SFK and WC are also some of my favorites
---
I'm thinking of rolling RP. I can see my characters being grumpy A-holes, already tired of everyone's sh\*t at level 1.
---
What youre thinking is total amount. We are talking about horde side popularity. You can basically double shaman percentage on that poll to get the right amount.
---
It's a only couple % from class to class, you're not gonna feel the difference.
---
Hi, /u/Slyfunklol
---
They truly are, but for $650 you should be able to get a pretty bangin set up, ryzen 5 1600 are less than $100 and then a B450mb for around $70, 16gb of ram for under $90 now, $50 for a 500w PSU, get a m.2 drive for $100 (SATA or nvme 500gb) skimp on the case ($60) and you'll have about $180 for a graphics card, which could easily get you a 580 8gb or 1060 6gb.

I dont recall them being that much in vanilla, but that was why they were a lot better in BC
---
For real. When I moved out my mom told me I had to have the room ready to be a guest room. Just the bedframe and mattress. Didn't have room for my desk, tv stand, or shelves so had to sell em all and buy new ones down the road. Whatever I didn't fit in my car had to get thrown away.
---
True true. Its only a small difference anyway. Gosh this unreleased game and my already developing addiction is causing me all these second thoughts on class choice. I thought I was done, now I’m still pondering.
---
hey wassup bro
---
Yeah I loved the Luxons and Jade Sea areas, made me happy when my guild chose the Luzon side.
---
Nightfall was cool too tough. :P
---
I was actually a Discipline Priest when I played UD (WotLK). Extra humiliation. Warriors would die to my bubble while getting no rage.
---
Not small, just don't bend that way really. Its not a natural hand movement. I've got nearly 60 keybinds when you add in the F1 - F5 for party targeting, tabs and v's for the name plates etc
---
I am glad the GMs did that for you 👍🏼
---
i do if u do
---
Nope, it was in vanilla.

---
Nah not alone man. But I just try to keep my mind out of it, been hitting the gym for 5 times a week now for couple of weeks to prepare myself for the summer fattening.
---
So I can run an AFK bot and after a few years of AFK I will get epics and clear all content because all that is required is time? Got it.
---
You were being sarcastic.
---
Wow this is dope! keep it up I love the flavor of this.
---
I still love the gw1 music, great soundtracks.
---
only if you only save the fraps of big crits.
---
Currently im stuck between shaman and warlock. Problem with shaman is i want to not be resto, pref enhance, but i also want to not have issues with raiding.
---
I originally played a human warrior. I mainly DPS'd but tanking dungeons while leveling.
---
This time around I'm going to roll a Troll priest. I really want to experience the raid scene as a support/healer class and I've always been drawn to cleric/priest type classes in RPGs. Also, while I don't really want to play a troll or undead priest (i'd much rather be an orc or tauren if it was possible), I want to play a horde character so I can experience the world from a different viewpoint. I've done all the alliance starting areas so many times it wouldn't feel quite as new.
---
It's pretty much what happens when fans of something wait around for it. You get the same thing between seasons in TV show subreddits. After a certain point, people just run out of meaningful things to post. The rest is memes and "should i play hunter or take a forklift certificate?"
---
I farmed this instance on my Warrior to sell Silk Cloth to get my Epic Mount.  And the week I got the money for the mount, they changed the riding skill and the mount costs.. so I paid double for my epic mount eventually.
---
Sure, but each upgrade is actually felt. And takes effort to acquire.
---
The original Scarlet Monastery is by far my favorite instance in the game. At one point in vanilla the tabard wasn't available and was reintroduced in a later patch. I remember seeing a night elf wearing it outside of AH in ironforge one day and i flipped out and spent the day running Armory to get it
---
When did the option of turning xp off come into wow?
---
No they don’t .
---
I guess its because humans remember negative experiences over positive ones, generally, so since most people's most memorable moments are either huge brawls or frusturating ganks thats all they think it is
---
I did it once, one of the recommended names for Undead was Arthas...yup got it.
---
Alright.
---
&gt; Can't wait to watch the carnage of those unprepared for BLADES OF LIGHT.
---
I mean it's not deadly, especially to melee who are wearing leather/mail. It does damage every 2 or 3 seconds so even after getting hit the first time, you have a couple seconds to get out.
---
cause it's unlimited data with a speed cap ;) some blocks it entirely.
---
By that logic, classic and everything that came after was breaking from that exact norm. 
---
Arguably the main reason wow literally bankrupted other games when it came out was because a type of game play became accessible to other segments than literal nolifers. Major quality of life-elements completely changed the genre for the better. 
---
Whatever floats your boat though, spending literally 15-20 minutes locked on a gryphon is unnecessary imo. There are a lot of, a whole lot, of old mmo mechanics that existed in classic only for the sake of slowing down the amount of fun you were allowed to have within a time frame. 
---
Things like that are basically considered predatory practice today, not saying it should be removed, just pointing out how silly it is to claim that content in this game was gated by skill caps. People to this day still die on mechanics like C’thuns rotating eye beam or Onys deep breath on private servers. That alone is proof that the only thing you need is time.
---
Seems like most of your assumptions are way off the mark. Id say out of any hybrid healer spec Priest is probably the worst choice. Shamans perform well overall as Ele/Resto and Holy Pallys are an excellent 1v1 class despite fighting extremely slowly.
---
&gt; You did compare warlocks to paladins, by introducing warlocks into the paladin argument. You are effectively saying "Tanking as a Paladin is as stupid as taking as a Warlock!"
---
So you can't comprehend. Got it.
---
Oh look, more strawmanning. 
---
&gt; based solely on if he can tank raids as the main tank or not?
---
Can you even read? I said multiple times that you have to consider everything and not one aspect.
---
&gt; Play what you like and stop worrying about being elite, unless what you really really want to do is be elite.
---
Nobody said anything about being elite. I even agreed that what you enjoy playing should be the main driving factor in what you decide to main. All I all was arguing, which you are intentionally ignoring, is that it is NOT the only aspect you should use to decide. All factors are relevant.
---
IF, sure.  Stormwind, it got destroyed by the Horde about 30 years before WoW begins.  Still has a head-start on Orgrimmar, but only by like 10-15 years (as rebuilding started in the gap between WC2 and WC3, and Orgrimmar starts at the end of WC3)
---
Resto/Balance hybrid is probably the best bet. There's some vids by Stormx you can see on youtube on how to play it. (Although he always has Engineering and lets face it, not everyone can play like that.)
---
Apart from that, bubble hearth and run away.
---
The only thing that matters is if you are having fun.
---
especially dwarves.
---
As a plate wearer I love this guy.
---
It's not just about the players on this subreddit. People who actually had a lvl 60 are more likely to answer this poll, while people on this subreddit who did not play in vanilla are more likely to ignore it.
---
One guy put a bunch of effort into analyzing the raid spots vs class economy of Classic, based on a random public poll and a video with some mediocre player's ideas of raid setups. It was a great post really but the data was just so absurdly useless that it was baffling.
---
I've never built one before. Definitely considered it in the past. It just might be time to. I'll more than likely be going on a research binge now lol. Thanks!
---
I’m guessing no one would tell the difference between you specifically and a bot, so yeah p much
---
Playing on pservers there were a ton of shamans. There was almost always one every group and sometimes we had 3.
---
I think the misconception is when people look at stats for both factions combined it looks like shamans and pallys are the least popular.
---
Disc/Shadow is pretty strong in pvp.   
---
And you benefit raid,  your raid wont need a Shadowpriest.  Instead you stack Shadow Weaving, give PI and heal.
---
True. I feel like this is very common misconception. Well, we’ll see when the real thing is out ^soon
---
As a mage you'd want it to remove curses right?
---
I agree I love how ugly org is and that DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUM DUM music is the best.
---
Shared an account with my dad back then both of us had 60s his were hunter and mage while I had a warrior. Unfortunately we never got to play with one another in vanilla but we're looking forward to changing that in classic. At the moment we're planning on me going paladin and him going mage or warrior which should be fun.
---
*gasp*
---
exactly. even getting to into the 30's to get a 'feel' for the class is  a time investment.  
---
by the time you get another class to that point (assuming you like it) you are so far behind your friends/guild.
---
You can be popular and be in high demand at the same time.
---
Strange. Complete lack of flasks, elixirs and world buffs. You mean you can kill a boss without these??
---
Soo right now im for Warlock UD on Horde and NE Rogue on Alliance which is decided by my Friends which Faction well choose,
---
Anyway Tankwarri always creeps up my Head, i leveled one to 60 on a wellknown Privaterealm and it was a Blast!! Also im very Experienced WoW Player with easily over 500 days played and alot of Achivements ( tho i only got to Aq40 back in the days, since i was only 16) 
---
I also believe being MT would be most enjoyable for me but heres the Problem... im about to get my first Kid in November and i probably wont have that much time to be a dedicated Tank :/ im just not the type to do some Partly stuff and not being able to attend every Raid probably lessens my chance of being MT to almost 0 :/
---
Help me Guys
---
Yeah it currently says 75% of people had a level 60 during vanilla. 
---
I find it very hard to believe that even 10% of the people on the sub were even alive during vanilla.
---
its certainly possible to reach exalted and get undead mounts. 
---
I really dont know if you can do it by 40. 
---
I dont think an undead character that leveled exclusively in Lordearon would be exalted and as an orc you start from Neutral not friendly. At the very least it would require most if not all of your cloth (and more) to reach exalted in time. 
---
Definitely doable for your epic mount though. And leveling through the region would give you quite the edge on reaching it.
---
could you explain why priest is the worst choice?
---
This is true, and like I said, I dont mean shamans arent needed, as raids take in a lot of shammys.
---
Just wait until you look in the box and disc 4 is nowhere to be found. It's been replaced with a DVD of Cars 2 and you will never find it.
---
Getting there as alliance is so not worth it. For Horde, sure.
---
Here you go

Start crunching those numbers.
---
thats awesome, druids seem pretty fun, didn't know if they were capable of fighting. I'll take a look, thanks!
---
I leveled multiple characters to 60, then did it again with every class at least once on pservers.  I'm just going to try and go wherever I'm least familiar with.
---
I don't have this problem. I know what I like (the cleric archetype) so I'm going priest!
---
One nice thing about locks is you can use sm ruin spec for pve and pvp so you don't have to respec ever
---
Fantastic
---
There are many ways to succeed in Classic and skills of various kinds play a huge role in how and when you reach that success. If all you’re saying is that Classic’s PvE mechanics are not very hard, then you’re right, but that’s a facile point.
---
Still better than having the same "are feral druids viable guys?" thread every second day. 
---
Long form discussion died when online forums decided to put the new flashy thing on top instead of that one hundred page thread that has been going on for a year.
---
Because you don't want to feel jealous of another class after they shit on you in a 1v1 in the open world
---
This is true, as well as the Camp T flight path but that is irrelevant for Classic as we are getting a 1.12 baseline world.
---
Remember the grind to 60 is REAL. Manage your time wellness... LOK'TAR O'GAR
---
Druids cant be killed in the world if they know how to play.
---
Priests can do okay, but you sacrifice healing talents you need at later stages of the game to get underpowered offensive talents to make you OKAY at dpsing. That said, as a normal healing priest, you just rot and outlast your opponent. 
---
Sham and paladins are just good out in the world. their healing talents make they very survivable and their defualt kit is a lot to deal with.
---
It's very easy now a days and super fun! Maybe your SO will enjoy building it together. 
---
Also a 512gb m.2 is probably only $50 not $100, so there's more for case, PSU, or GPU depending.
---
Good luck!
---
You just stop before the boss, and wait for your twink to run in.  If the item doesn't drop, reset.  You still get a little XP, so gotta plan ahead.
---
Indeed, but I needed to make it relevant to the nessy situation with the literal hundreds of skeletons piled up at his feet.

I just want to hunt down horde cucks with my sweet old bald dwarf...
---
Yep.  I took pride in my ads and got a lot of people to seek me out specially because of them.  Enchanting is the social profession and I want it to be forever so.
---
Twinstar vanilla is a good alternative resource when classicdb for some reason doesn't want to tell you where an item drops from.
---
Also useful to cross reference in case some item / entries seem off.
---
Arthas is not in the list of names I have for undead or anything else, so its just a coincidence it was generated for you. Imma call that a win ;)
---
Awesome! I’m special.
---
I still have my 5 CDs. And the BC and wotlk ones too
---
Thanks for answering man, so you're suggesting druid or paladin? Would a holy paladin in that scenario hold a second set of strength gear with a 2hand or something? or do they keep intell gear on
---
What a fucking Chad
---
Yeah, had to take like two months off the game due to national service and hit 60 somewhere around patch 1.6. I remember ZG coming out while I had been 60 for quite a while. Back in those days, players were separated much more into raiders and non-raiders. There would typically be only a few raiding guilds on a server. Since many had come over from Everquest where only like 5% of the playerbase got to raid at all (EQ content wasn't instanced, it was all world bosses with like 7 day respawns), many were totally satisfied just getting the "best blues" as it was called before someone coined the term "BiS." I was one of those. Had the fully optimized pre-raid BiS including Maelstrom card, Myrmidon Signet and Ironfoe. Just didn't raid, because I was a non-raider in EQ and it never crossed my mind to try it in WoW. Very few did it and it was actually a pretty big deal if you saw someone with more than a couple of epics.
---
I have been wondering the same thing for a while. I don't think we have any official word on this topic, but if anyone knows more than I do I would be delighted to know.
---
Probably because, as shadow, you cant heal yourself. You would have to pop out to heal yourself and then go back in.
---
You would have to spec into a smite build.
---
My wow+tbc download took 2 days
---
FAPS are dispellable. You need to kill the whole orc to "dispell" hardiness ;-)
---
60 keybinds thats absolutly insane. There is never ever need for that? Especially not for classic..
---
Sweet thanks!  I'm on my mobile so correct me if I'm wrong:  
---
-I need to go to each link individually and tally the rep from completing it?
---
-are the rep values listed the total you actually receive from completing the quest or is it modified?  How does the spillover rep work?
---
Thanks again
---
I believe it's a great insult to a dwarf to deny him a fight.
---
Undead's have the most overpowered racial (wotf) for pvp in vanilla
---
Dive bombing people in TBC was fun but it sure made the world a smaller place.
---
Ah right the friendly start is only for your own race...
---
All I've ever expected is to have fun.
---
That's literally going to take 1 month /played, roughly.
---
Some people don't have the kind of time to commit to that.
---
Even if you could play 4 hours a day on average (well above what someone with proper commitments can do), that would take **6 months** of RL time just to level to 60, and do no gearing, no money making, or profession leveling.
---
Look at the number of spells and potions on that keybinding sheet alone... It's like 52.
---
I agree with the time waste, I did it anyways when I was younger. I spent a lot of time leveling and doing dungeons when I first started playing wow. 
---
A big thing for me was the traveling and finding new places to explore. I remember my first time around level 11 walking to Stormwind from Auberdine as a Nelf Hunter. I was amazed by everything, the city was so new and I couldn't get enough. There was a hunger to explore.
---
Nah stoneclaw does it. Protip: so does the first tick of earthbind IIRC
---
You don’t need both abolish disease and cure disease, they cost the same mana. Abolish simply replaces cure. Also, I tend to make my downranks the modified version of the highest rank spell, but it doesn’t seem like you tend to do that. Thought that was interesting
---
This is what I’m looking forward to most in vanilla - all the min/maxing in the world won’t save you if you don’t have “something” others simply don’t. And sure, maybe he lived closer to the servers, or something like that. But even still, some guys were just better performers than others.
---
It’s kinda like when you meet a guy with a bigger dick. You can buy a bigger truck, or a nicer house, but you just can’t beat having a bigger dick.
---
The rebuilding effort used the entire race of humans, and dwarves and gnomes also helped though... That's a pretty big advantage lol
---
Gotta have your profession advertising macros.
---
Nothing was better for me than when Isle of quel'danas came out with sunwell
---
;-)
---
I played a tbc pserver recently and the pvp is so shit. It's more imbalanced than vanilla and flying mounts completely ruin everything. You kill a guy at plateau and then he finds a place to res and mounts up. Then he just sits above you waiting for you to engage a mob or get low and there's literally nothing you can do against it. Shit wpvp in that expansion and you are completely absolutely fucked if a 70 ganks you as a lowlvl. Also epic fly mount while it took a lot of time for people to get and very few had it, was just retarded how fast it is.
---
&gt; Definitely doable for your epic mount though
---
Based on what source?
---
Is this the one that was based on the wow beta?
---
Agree completely. If you run dungeons efficiently, it really is not a massive time-loss. Sure, the "server first hunters" will skip the instances, and have a solid route to bypass.
---
Leveling a warrior without access to blue dungeon loot for the boost in gear is a total pain. Axe of orgrimmar from RFC, the quest ring from sfk, the rewards from WC... and all the other awesome items that can drop that help you leveling faster. It's not mandatory for a warrior to do instances, but it helps so much.
---
Yes you are grumpy old man
---
Hi, /u/Wmulax24
---
And you can go do it to the other faction to blow off steam, too!
---
That was a fantastic time.
---
I remember the Elemental Plateau being fun in TBC but it still wasn't anything near Vanilla level of fun.
---
The divers dropping from their mounts made it feel like you were never isolated from intrusion during your battles. Also, the addition of resilience made it annoying to PvP outside of arena/bgs since someone in regular gear would never be able to fare against someone in a PvP set. 
---
Most of the time you encountered world PvP you were either leveling, finishing quest chains or farming so it's likely you wouldn't have PvP gear yet.
---
Dododo?
---
Quite frankly, vanilla WPvP was exhausting. The battlegrounds were awesome but I think BC was better overall for World.
---
Great to have you on board. Now join us in the anxious waiting of release date; youre in for addictive refreshing of the reddit page, and yes, it only gets worse everyday!!
---
I can dig it.
---
Playing a "no no" server where you drop loot and inventory items on death. Certainly makes dying in retail feel like it isn't painful at all when you know you have no fear of losing gear.
---
First of all i don't think people are saying shaman are rare. i'd guess, you looked at the mixed faction stats and you didn't account for the fact that shamans counted once for one faction and other classes (except for paladin) are  twice for both faction. so you confused yourself. (a common mistake ppl do).
---
Second, census data from ppl actually playing on private servers shows the different results. i guess, what ppl imagine or wanting to play differes from the real deal and actually playing and getting 60.
---
And also people going to forums and filling up google surveys is a special type of people. not everyone does it, only certain type of personalities would do it, so it affect the numbers, so you cant say these stats is one to one to all the people that gonna play.
---
just some cencuses i quickly googled (not saying its the best takes or anything just some first that popped):

just google yourself the actual stats of the actual players on the actual servers, not some participation biased "what you feel you gonna play" quizes from forums.. and then basing youк whole idea of the pop numbers on that.
---
in terms of numbers shamans are quite middle of the pack average i'd say. thats also how it feels in game.
---
It’s a sound effect that symbolizes “menacing” 
---
Basically using characters in a manga to symbolize/create an atmosphere that sound would do in a tv show.
---
Are you sure those numbers are accurate for Classic?
---
LOL.  "Thrall's putting chemicals in the water and turning the freakin' murlocs gay!"
---
Quest to unlearn the spec, is that for both of them or just for Engi?
---
2-3 hours a day is plenty to get to know your class. I’d say Shaman over mage, in that case. Just spend a few days practicing/building macros and keybindings at max level. Run through a few dungeons with them, and focus on using everything at your disposal. Burn through all your cooldowns as if every pull depends on it. That way, when you’re in PvP, you’re already used to managing your CD’s and such at the outset of every engagement. I think the biggest difference between PvE and PvP players in vanilla was actually that many times the PvE guys save - then die with - their cooldowns unused.
---

I guarantee there is no way to get Exalted by 40 with Undead as an Orc, unless the cloth turn-in Quartermaster is available by that point and someone gives you tons of Runecloth and/or you buy tons of it from the AH with a level 60 alt that farms gold/Runecloth for you.
---
I'd be surprised if you can hit Exalted by *60* with *any* race/reputation without an incredible amount of effort... by which point, it'd be faster to just get to 60 quickly and farm up the rep at that point (doing what you can along the way, quest-wise) through Runecloth turn-ins.
---
Ah yes, I always appreciated those moments!
---
Arcanist Doan will wreck way more people than Herod. After the first hit everyone will run away from Herod but unless you know about it, Doans aoe is not obvious (just looks like any other spellcast)
---
You’re right. It’s still funny. I should be laughing at this dead meme. I was wrong.
---
I liked how a lot of the buildings looked like the buildings in the RTS games. (barracks, town hall/keep/castle, lumber mill, etc.)
---
it sort of made you feel like you were playing as a unit from the RTS, instead of commanding the whole army. the art/architecture style in newer expansions has lost the feeling of the RTS art style
---
&gt;board
---
I never got into RP myself, but I’m sure there’s plenty of gear available for that
---
Right on. Would this apply to both elemental and resto specs?
---
I never bring hunters or pallys to SM unless the pally is healing and promises to only roll on heal gear
---
Yeh I always loved Diablo 2, Heroes of the Storm and vanilla WoW's hp numbers. I'ts like the perfect amount, hp between 3k to 10k.
---
Obviously Diablo 2's dmg was a little unbalanced but still it just feels right and Heroes of the Storm is also using the same ballpark, 
---
but sadly lost interest in HoTS after what happened after Blizzcon.
---
To add to what others are saying -
---
A level 5 boar who knows bite rank 1 will NEVER learn bite rank 2 on his own. You have to stable him, tame a higher level let that already knows bite rank 2, kill a few mob with him until you see another message that says you have learned bite rank 2. Once you do that, you can release the new pet and bring your old one out and teach it bite rank 2 with the pet point system
---
I freaking love this
---
Roll a priest and stand near a high place that's barely survivable if they jump. The cast PW:Fortitude on 'em as they jump....

Not every night, but you’re right. That’s what most people did. Then spec back to raidspec the next week. Two respecs/week.
---
I know they said a lot of automated macros like healbot and recursive will no longer work.

Basically anything that made the game brainless is going the way of the dodo.

Hotw/NS druids are pretty handy in PvP outside of their tanking/healing roles in raids. Mix your gear up so you have alot of mana for plenty of shifting and some survivability, blue PvP gear will work a treat here.
---
I played a Nelf hunter and Shadow meld was awesome but only in a few situations. It was a great threat drop after blasting someone in Booty bay or Gadgetzan. It was helpful if you were the last person alive and you had to move out from Onny's feet. And supreme aimed shots wee hilarious. But I do kinda wish I had a dwarf in PVP.
---
Mostly Dark Souls 2.  My brother and I coordinate to summon each other and progress through the game, it's a lot of fun.
---
Lvl 29 rogue is my personal fav.   29 pallys are pretty fun too
---
It definite, only a handful of people would possibly reach 100k (tbh not even sure if that was possible). 1mil is completely impossible in wotlk
---
Anything with a Rez since hey get themselves killed often.

To Be Continued

I think resto was the best, but a lot of guys had tons of fun with elemental. I think if you wanted to kill things, enhancement was really good, but bursty, and unfortunately carried the heavy dependence on having good gear. I’d recommend finding some shaman threads here and see if you can talk to someone who played the class in vanilla - they’re usually super friendly and have great advice for leveling/gearing/play styles
---
Maybe a tad of both. You’ll need to be more careful as a rogue especially early on. It’s a common notion that rogue &amp; warrior are very difficult to level early on. Just work on it and get used to the differences. Wand on Priest was OP.
---
Good deal. Thank you!
---
MMOs are all a straight up grind fest masked in entertainment.  Every "quality of life" improvement like shorter graveyard runs they implement forces them to put in some other grind.  Eventually we end up with mind numbing azerite farm.
---
I'm ready to bring back some difficulty into my life.  Make me measure actions and consequences.
---
Hi, /u/Magnfull
---
I used to do that but I felt it flowed far better this way. Especially seeing as situationally some spells  are not used for the same thing. Lesser Heal is a, I've got 0 mana almost, just used the last of it on a fear and need something to top up a little. Holy nova rank 1 is just for rogues and druids stealthing about. 
---
That's a good tip though that abolish disease isn't required! I assumed that there was situations where one may need both.
---
I was heartbroken when they changed ST from the original format down the expansion line.
---
it depends on the class, if you're a warrior running armory is amazing
---
You see him.  He sees you.  /wave  /train  /chicken  /charge

I love emoting with other ghosts.
---
In regards to PC upgrades, could someone make a gaming mouse recommendation for WoW, specifically? No particular budget constraints, just looking to do it right.
---
To each their own. I guess it's whatever you got used to.  I thought the same about abolish too until my latest reroll on a private server where I took a harder look at the two of them
---
Lol
---
I literally played the beta with my brother, went to Iraq, WoW released, and I was home a few months later. When I logged on, all I wanted to do was PVP. Age could have been a part of it, but I was a little more bloodthirsty back in the day. 
---
Since my original toon, I have made a series of other toons and chilled out in my old age. Now, all I want to PVE Tank. I am still bold and don't mind doing the outlandish. I also like to PVP for fun, especially in WSG and AV. 
---
But yeah, between my age and environmental change over 15 years, I would say I have different priorities and styles.
---
There’s been so much discussion there’s not too much novel to talk about because we aren’t getting that much info from Blizz.
---
I like classic,but I do prefer the TBC classes tbh.
---
I think you misunderstood the concepts idea. 
---
This would help in finding a guild that you can build a relationship with and be able to progress through raid tiers, with the same people every week at a time that works best for all said people in the guild. 
---
Not a LFR random group of people every week like you state.
---
I mean... You heal by doing damage, maybe slapping a renew on when you can but... You have nice self healing at least. 
---
Provide nice support to the team while doing said damage too.
---
Same goes for shamans. The blue staff from the WC quest is a must, as well as getting corpsemaker for lvl 30 and windfury.
---
Awesome, I will have a look at it myself for sure now!
---
I was 17 when I started classic im 30 now. The world of classic pulls you in partly because it requires effort to achieve your goals.
---
They will disable most (if not all) APIs that contribute to allow addons and macros being able to make intelligent decisions regarding spell casting, spell selection, targeting, cancelling spell casts if it wasn't going to be effective etc. etc.
---
I love this. I actually saved it to my phone.
---
As much as I think I know what I want to do, it will come down to a last minute decision based on what my friend wants to play. Its the social aspect I really miss from it
---
You're not just playing bad.  It's a common theme for warriors or rogues leveling solo.  I died 5 times leveling from 1-10 on alliance.  My time played to 10 was 2h35mins.  It's just difficult to handle more than 1 mob at a time with a rogue.  
---
Two tips:
---
1. Out level the quests/zone
---
2. Focus on having a strong main hand weapon while leveling a rogue
---
Taverncast got me through working retail full time and going to school full time.
---
You dont need binds for half these potions and your bindings are not very optimal. You can easily have some of them on the same bind and clicking a mana potions is absolutly not a loss at all. But each their own, i just wouldnt be able to have to rely on half these bindings. Why not shit +mousewheel for dispel and so on?
---
Cant wait to see these little fuckers get critted to the hell where they belong to.
---
Yes, Vanilla is definitely the best exp for WPvP. The only reason you wouldn't like it is if you just don't really like WPvP, even if you claim to, I'd suggest you do some soul searching. Flying mounts have absolutely no place in a game that takes place primarily on the ground, for more than one reason, and I'll argue that to the death.
---
It does take him a few seconds to channel it, but you need to know of the ability beforehand to notice it :P
---
There's no better race for hunters than Dwarf. The only exception to that is debately orcs for "command".
---
You can also use poison cleansing totems against rogues.
---
Nothing beat those Looty-Tuesday’s!
---
This is my plan too. To me, this is the optimal way to play.

Prelude to Bladestorm
---
For classic this macro would have to be reworked to something like this:  
---
  /cast [nopet] Revive Pet  
---
  /cast [pet:petname] Mend Pet
---
They said something about how they will not be allowing the crazy scripting that was possible with the vanilla macro system. Things like a macro that will target the lowest hp group member, target a group member with a curse and decurse them, etc. 
---
That’s about all we know about the changes to macros but I believe it’s safe to assume that most of the new features that are in the modern macro system will be available. Things like #showtooltip, help/harm macros etc. Things that weren’t necessarily available but are mostly just UI things that addons could probably do for you anyways. 
---
Off the top of my head a macro that might not be in because it could be argued that it makes gameplay easier would be @player, @curser (for instantly casting targeted aoe without having to click) or mouseover macros which make healing/dispelling easier (I’m not 100% if it was possible to do mouseover healing in vanilla)
---
I’ll guiltily have to agree. I actually really liked in WoTLK when they added the mount reward for killing all the faction leaders. That seemed to increase the amount of city raids and I would join up for those every chance I could get, even after I had my mount. It was great times!
---
No shit, I joined the NAVY at 18 and my room was converted into a guest room before I left boot camp
---
Flatline, played a Tauren Warrior - the Australian one lol
---
I'm still kinda bummed I didn't have the mental strength to at least hit 60 at the time, but I guess I probably wouldn't have made rank 14 either. Planning to give it a proper go with the release of classic
---
Okay well this is where as I explained there's more than one way to cook an egg. Slightly different options for slightly different results. 
---
I'm terms of potions. Everytime you move your mouse to click on something, you have to rely on either auto run, or you need to stop moving, both are bad enough BUT more so, you need to briefly take your eyes off the screen and in PvP, those split seconds can be crucial in a game as bursty as vanilla. Missing something and catching it that little bit later can mean the difference between a win and a loss. 
---
Each to their own though, I don't struggle to hit any of these binds and I prefer not to rely on a mouse wheel where I can accidentally rub it and lose globals.
---
It sounds like you’re saying he thinks he likes it, but he doesn’t.
---
Yeah that sort of thinking never backfires.
---
well the fact that its possible, mostly? 
---
There is nothing stopping a gnome from getting a NELF mount or a orc from a Undead mount, except rep.
---
Cloth is an infinite resource--you just have to go farm it--turning it in yields rep.
---
It's going to be a small minority min/maxing their leveling to an insane degree. Server first guilds and toon races. As I dont care about either of those, I'll be efficient within whatever personal knowledge I have from playing vanilla a long time ago and that suits me fine. 
---
Also I think you see a lot of that talk here just because people are bored and looking to do whatever to pass the time until release.

Rogue 1-20 is probably the worst in the game. It’s like a warrior forced to dual wield and wear leather. It gets better when you unlock skills/talents but it can be hard work getting to 35-40 where you finally feel like a half complete class.
---
the vanquishers sword is pretty worth it imo. super good on rogues, warriors, hell even hunters. the neck that you also get from the quest is really good for leveling as well (cuz of the high spirit) which people are now saying is probably the best leveling stat on all classes
---
Great art style. I'd love to see more like these.
---
You start at friendly for all allied races. Except for undead. Orcs/trolls/tauren start at neutral and UD start at neutral to the other three.
---
Unpopular opinion: Cross zone fights on the Great Wall of Pandaria were the pinnacle of WPVP for me. 
---
Everyone had engineering. Everyone had a cape to float in case they got knocked off. Everyone had a boomerang to dismount people. Some of the tactics were crazy. 
---
As a Druid, instant flight was amazing. Dive bomb in over the main Zerg, stealth, burst healers down, hurricane a few off the edge, jump off and use my glider then jump into flight form once I left combat. Rinse and repeat.
---
Some of the mass PVP battles were better than any of the Southshore/Tarren Mill battles I had ever in 2006. Probably because my computer in Pandaria could handle them better!
---
Most remembered for being a mention in the Dave Chapelle “Racial Draft” skit.
---
Oh shit, I missed the part where you said you're devoting cloth during your time leveling.  
---
I thought for a moment that you were saying you'd reach exalted by 60 via quests alone.
---
Well thanks! I've only be refreshing about 70 times a day, so it's not too bad yet.
---
I figure since theyve started or about to start any day now behind closed door Alpha testing we could be looking at closed Beta testing announcement by mid May, I guess I wouldnt expect any more Blue Posts for about 2 weeks.
---
I plan on tanking 5 mans till 60. Do some BRD, DM, &amp; BRS (L+U). I plan on doing some molten core, but I really wanna make money in ZG. BWL on the side, and move onto AQ40. I wanna get 2 or 3 items from AQ40, and I wanna fill in gear gaps and head to Naxx.

I gota say I havnt felt this good in years, I might keep on trucking even after WoW launch.
---
Came here to say this. When we weren't doing battlegrounds or arena or heroic MGT me and my 3 friends were picking fights on the Isle.
---
No, on PvE iirc you will get flagged if you walk into an opposing city, or get too close to guards which are around encampments/starting areas/faction quest zones/etc.
---
This is definitely very useful thanks I will look into this!
---
Like half the quests in Vanilla are ‘kill x mobs’
---
I assume this is from an alliance PoV.  Are you leveling solo or in a group of friends?  Caster or melee?  BFD has a really good wand from a quest reward.  I recommend you look up:

---
And see what quest rewards you can get from each dungeon too, as this is at least guaranteed loot for you.
---
*Laughs in unlimited data plan*
---
But that does actually apply to some people. It's obviously a case by case basis. Good old Brack had no bearing on saying whether or not people could like an entire game with all it's differences. This is just one guy talking about one thing. Basically, I'm asking OP to respond in a way that actually explains to me why he thinks he likes WPvP when he doesn't want it sometimes. I think it's just a case of wanting to have his cake and eat it too, but we'll see.
---
As a rogue my only must hit dungeons while I level are SM, RFD, Mara as these have great swords from quest rewards so I don't have to worry about getting lucky with drops.
---
I'd love to run through each 5 man at least once, but I'm not gonna go out of my way to make it happen. In general, questing/grinding is going to be better if your goal is to level faster. Dungeon quests are worth a good bit of exp, but the time it takes to form a group and get there and run the dungeon usually outweigh this.
---
In my personal opinion: All of them.
---
What's the point of Classic? Why are we all hyped? It's a trip down memory lane. Why go down memory lane at 100mph? I'm going to visit every dungeon at least once, to get that pure nostalgia feel while it's fresh.
---
Elemental can be super bursty but you need to be decently close to get it off. If you can get a frost bolt off  you can basically just use instants to kill someone between fb, nova + CoC and blastwave. If you need to stay range (like bigger big fights) you’re gonna be at a disadvantage because of the seasons stated above ( no barrier or imp cs)

I’m in a new dimension. A week ago I thought about deleting my private servers off my laptop so I could focus on other games and projects. Now I’m constantly watching classic info videos and/or playing a character that will be the basis for my Classic main, just on a private server.

If you spec 0/30/21 you can tank/heal/dps with the spec. You can even heal yourself with nature swiftness if things goes south.

I literally gave my friends a schedule of my raid times and told them “if you want to hang out on these days and these times, you know where I’m at”.

It's strong af no doubt, but Hardiness on warrior beats wotf imho
---
I plan on doing WC, ST, BRD, SM, ZF at minimum. Probably RFC just to say I did the 1st Horde one available to me.
---
Besides mounts ... what else is there?
---
What does "do do do" represent here?
---
For real. End game is not the goal for all people. If I werent looking forward to 60 pvp so much, I would be nearly as happy leveling multiple characters to run low lvl dungeons. I love RFK and SM.
---
Fear was hit in 1.11 to break based on Scaled Damage instead of Base damage.  Off the top of my head this was like 2-3x higher chance of breaking from DD.  In the same patch they lowered the chance of DoTs breaking fear by a similar amount to keep parity on DoT break chance.
---
1.12 added this to Warrior and priest fear.

You may be able to find a group thats looking to put together a guild and find a spot thats not taken yet.

21 FPS? Look at Mr. Double-Digit-Framerate over here.

I raided Vanilla -&gt; Sunwell at 3-8 FPS and I liked it.
---
Gouge almost every mob and time your energy pooling so you don’t break it early. Bandages and health potions help a lot.  Try not to pull a mob unless you’re at full energy and even then you can time the pull so that your first ability comes a fraction of a second before an energy gain. There’s addons that track when you get an energy tick.
---
yeesh .. I forgot that 30 - 60 was a real slog.  This is going to be interesting.  I always give up on pservers by the time I hit 20something.
---
A lot of this actually describes classic wow too which is always the interesting point between BFA and Classic for me (since I plan to play both). 
---
You have the same quests in classic wow.. Kill X, pickup items X,Y,Z. Escort this dude who will get jumped at these exact spots, run this errand and drop something off for me.  But a difference is the quests are generally isolated to a zone and don't tend to run you all over the map to complete.  While a lot of quests are zone specific there are also some that make you go to other zones to complete so more travel time.  But questing will be the same you'll just be weaker.
---
As for quest rewards feeling more impactful to you in classic, it's because each stat point is so limited in terms of the item level.  You might wait until you're level 15 before you really get any green items at all aside from a handful from quests but you'll still be rocking some white items.  And even then it'll be like.. 1 int.. and eventually at level 60 you'll get a green with 10 int.. so each point is felt more.  In BFA because items are much larger in terms of gap  (200+ ilevel between 110 and 120?) that the extra 15 int wont make a difference when you already have 250 int.   So it feels more impactful to get a 3 int upgrade in classic.  But you also have MANY more stats to juggle.  
---
Classes themselves are more normalized over the years yes.  But while paladin might feel like a warrior, the paladin is also 100% viable in all roles at all content.  Where as in vanilla it feels different from a warrior because he really can't tank.. and he really can't DPS.. I mean.. he can DO those roles but not as well.. so BFA (and really from TBC on) specs were made to be able to do all content so that you can play what you want not how you have to because you literally can't do a role without 3-4x the effort of someone in that role. 
---
Allied races aren't really a good benchmark I feel.  It is a bit of a content bandaid but it does offer more race options and class options for players so not ALL your druids are elves.. now they can be elves, worgen and kul tirans.  With some cool forms.  But it's just cosmetic. 
---
As for PVP pre-mades being 5 DPS vs a group with healers, that really isn't BFA's fault more the fault of whoever was setting up the pre-made. And if you just joined random groups in LFM PVP finder then then probably no one cared and just wanted to try for kills for the weekly. 
---
But grinding is a thing in classic very much so and gearing will take longer in general.  ou may have grinded for the kul'tirans by getting the rep, doing all the war campaign quests and such, but that's honestly easier than say getting argent rep to exalted.  Having to do quests is the same, but grinding scourage stones instead of just doing world quest and even on a week where rep is increased by 50%.  
---
Classic will be a different experience and a lot in the game has changed but at the core game mechanics.. do quests, get levels, then get rep, and get gear... the core is really the same between bfa and classic.. it's just how it's presented.
---
I like you...

Paladin vs Druid for feeling invincible, support PVP and 5/10/20 mans. Which one?

Have kids. Have done baby thing, full clear as maintank for baby agro. Have many babies in family. Unless your kid is special needs they arent as big of a time/money thing as TV and movies make em out to be. The way you talk about gettin a kid vs due date makes me think you're dad to be. Congratulations btw. Life dont stop, you'll have plenty of time to do your thing AND you have to know you're in the highest age demographic to be playing meaning there's loads of people in your shoes that will need a tank. Frankly if my tank needs a bit to take care of sick kid or this or that I'm okay with that. Let the sweaty jerks with no adult responsibilities reee all they want, imo they just arent lucky enough to have baby agro.

What do you mean by threat drop?
---
its definitely has its rough patches but fuck man.... its all worth it. Was 15 when I started vanilla and idk like i hated leveling HATED IT. I was so fucking bad at it. But fuck.... that feeling I got when I finally got 60 (probably a year later). Then my first raid, first time killing Ony, then rag from MC then Nef from BWL. Just such great moments. 
---
I know it will be a brutal climb but I cannot wait to redo it. Having to actually run places with no flying mounts, find groups instead of do Dungeon/raid finder makes everything feel so much more special.
---
TBC pserver. So good.
---
It’s not my goal for classic. As user friendly as raiding in retail is right now I don’t have time for even LFR. I raided in vanilla and I am Very aware of the time commitment it will take and I’m just not going to have that. Instead I’ll level the classes I enjoy to 60 and run dungeons and make my own fun.
---
I remember regularly raiding as a MT with an average of 14 fps.
---
It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.
---
From what I hear it's still the original source code just modernized.
---
Trick is to kill mobs 1-2 levels below you.
---
A few classes really benefit from getting the Crescent Staff in WC. Lots of spirit

alas unregistered hypercam + 140p means most of these crits were lost in time, like tears in rain.

I am looking to get into role play for the classic release. I will be NA servers with a preference for RP and/or RP-PvP server types. I very much enjoy PvP in WoW and the setting in classic offers beautiful world PvP and excellent story line potential with RP-PvP. I will be playing Horde side mainly though will almost certainly make alliance characters as that's something I always wanted to experience. I will be a Troll Mage or Shaman for my main character. Play times will be 11pm-4am MST (so might be EU servers work better for me but we'll see :P). Priority is Role play, Followed by PvE and then PvP but I enjoy most aspects of the game and can navigate fluidly between all areas.

I would require an LGBTQ+ friendly environment and that's about the only absolute necessity. Please shoot a reply or a PM here for any interested guilds or parties to take this lovely Troll in. ^,.,^

Ok, that's fine?
---
I wasn't commenting on your choice, I was just saying why this requires a very large time investment so isn't viable for a lot of people.
---
Do I have to explain everything to you three or more times?
---
It is possible that sombody will have more fun playing a better spec so getting groups is quicker.
---
It depends on how much they value getting into groups quickly and easily.
---
It depends on how much value the specific classes they are considering in comparison to eachother.
---
It depends on how much they value many other things in the game.
---
You are not the authority on deciding how people should pick their class. People need to figure out what THEY value and weigh all aspects in accordance with those values.

---
My experience in wow was that as long as I wasn't running the least viable skill tree on a hybrid class, there was room to raid if I was willing to 'pay dues' in the guild (meaning join and work up the content with them, don't join when they're on Naxx). Keep in mind Vanilla WoW raid size is 40 people, not 25
---
Maybe that is an innate part of the lead designer being a very focused and competitive kind of gamer. More emphasis is put on the endgame content aka raids and the leveling process and rpg elements become a necessary obstacle in an mmorpg.
---
The same can be seen in private server communities and classic wow theorycrafting - advanced levelers skip dungeons, professions, gear from the auction house, grouping for quests. For someone who wants to beat the endgame asap the way there is probably an annoyance. someone like hazzicostas who most likely is very prone to optimizing the shit out of a game will not care much about these immersion elements because they are tedious in the eyes of a player who wants to test his gaming skills first and foremost.
---
I laughed at that sentence as well.
---
If you're the only person in combat  and Meld, they'll drop combat. If you're, say, in a raid situation then everything g you had comes right back so it's garbage for that but it's great solo.

Oh on a private server... I dont know if this happened in live... I got in an epic pvp battle against a rogue at the alliance place at the top of stonetalon.

I died at the very very north tip of the zone in glorious combat.

My ghost spawned in Darkshore....
---
Joining a guild at a relatively low level. Wondering from area to area to grind or whatever before I even turned level 40. Struggling to pay for my mount until a buddy gave me what I needed. Freaking out when I found an epic sword at level 35ish when I was grinding STV. Being the worst tank (warrior) imaginable until another buddy taught me what I was supposed to be doing. Begging to get someone to unlock the UBRS door. Getting the full Valor set to tank in (yes I know...). Getting my first piece of epic gear in MC. Buying a QS book and having Onyxia breath on it. Main tanking onyxia and MC bosses. Dying hundreds of times on Rattlegore. Helping someone that wasn’t in the guild get the Thundefury by giving them spare Elementium(?). Killing Nefarion for the first time.

And everything in between.

I’d recommend you do all of them at least once. Except Sunken Temple, fuck that place.
---
STANDO POWA: BLADES OF LIGHT
---
I remember you!  If it makes you feel better technically I didn't either, as I only hit Rank 13!  ;)  Many of the others did hit rank 14 who were motivated to.
---
Hope you have a great experience in classic!!
---
I know there is for engineering. I'm not sure about blacksmith and leatherworking.
---
Exactly this. However, World PvP had a different Charm back in Vanilla. Things were slower. Fewer people were playing. Those interactions didn't happen every day or every session. But when they did, it was usually a nice and chill time. DESPITE HAVING TO RUN TO YOUR CORPSE FOR FIVE MINUTES AS A GHOST. It just felt so good to pay the dude back.
---
Quel'Danas on the other hand was action packed every single day. It was the first time players were force into a world-arena by blizzard for daily quests.
---
It's more like encouraging people to play what they want to play, there's more reasons to play ret paladin than to top the dps meters, for example. 
---
Also that's a bad example cuz you can still land headshots with that SMG and kill very quickly lol
---
GE in csgo btw
---
can you recall any specific facts he cited or anything? That's interesting.  
---
I have a fuzzy memory of reading an article that was discussing the difference in 'bored' time for kids between the 2 most recent generations. Think about it: if you grew up before mobile devices were common you had to entertain yourself with imagination several times per day. Now, you can always get the phone from your parents' pocket and play a game.
---
Can you buy 6 months at the reduced 12.99 rate?
---
As alliance  
---
Deadmines    
---
Stockades       
---
SM    
---
ZF  
---
BRD  
---
Rest are maybes if I have some time to kill and aren't in a rush. I won't try to organise my play around doing them though.
---
nope, go have a look yourself. It actually didn’t exist
---
I’m confused you can only use this t buy month by month so you don’t get the subscription discount?
---
Aye,  I remember being sapped by horde who were not flagged for pvp.  I can’t remember if this was in classic or a bug in a later expansion?  Does anyone else remember?
---
My friend used to play on a 3G adapter that allowed 10-15gb a month during this era. Rural Australia, I had ADSL around the corner!
---
I live in the same area and now I have fibre while my friends around the corner still have 4G.. they have this issue amplified now because architecture and design programs / uploading a 3D model to the internet can now be hundreds of gigabytes..
---
Yess that's the right way to do it. Learn from the game by actually playing it, and just see it as a journey rather than a challenge.
---
You buy them... So any one you want... Or all of them... But you have to get that factions rep to exalted to learn that riding skill and ride them.
---
I'm not on a tangent. I'm on topic.
---
Maybe you should step away from reddit for a couple hours if you're this upset with seeing sombody else's opinion.
---
There's somethin like 80 "endgame" bosses and fear ward helps at like 12 of em. Do what you want.
---
You can run a survey if you actually wanted to verify some of your hypothesis. Can't say I agree with the conservative = classic / retail = liberal bit ... but that might just be because I'm a huge liberal who doesn't play retail and can't wait for classic.   
---
My hypothesis is that classic players are just older.
---
No problem at all.
---
Finding the things that make Reddit great is getting harder and harder, so I'm always happy to help people find their way.
---
Rogue is very difficult to solo level during the early levels.
---
It's "go"
---
Because half the specs are garbage at 60. 
---
Vanilla is a hefty time commitment and when you know which classes play like shit at max level you dont want to waste your time.
---
Back in vanilla we just picked what looked cool and we always had the hope that bad specs might get buffed. Now we know they didnt and wont get buffed
---
So the rep grind is still attached like the normal epic mounts? I see. Thank you.
---
Yes!

Let's be honest, you didn't forget they were there...
---
how did u have a pally in the guild ?
---
Yeah it's "do" on the picture but it should be "go" like it actually is in JoJo. I don't know why the artist changed that
---
Thank you for explaining that.
---
The efficiency boys will tell you that dungeons are only really worth doing if you got a bunch of quests for them. Also it's only worthwhile if you have a group that doesn't wipe numerous times and actually knows what they are doing. Think of doing Sunken Temple with a group of people not knowing how the statues work :D
---
Nostalgic guys will tell you: do them all. If you get invited, go and play. Classic is about interacting with other players. Efficiency is pointless if you're skipping out on fun to achieve it (personal opinion, not fact).
---
I'll probably do most of them. I'm gonna play alliance but I'll head other to the Scarlet Monastery on appropriate levels just to do it. I'll possibly do the Ragefire Dungeons as well because they are frikkin cool.
---
I’m not trying to suggest there’s a right or wrong way to play. Just stating that it seems more people are planning out their journey more so than I
---
I'm with you, except i've raided before, but on recent expansions. I have 0 experience on classic raids, although i've cleared them several times on my 100+ characters, i still don't know about the mechanics of classic raids, 'cause to clear them high level you just spam skills.
---
He actually facing away from herod. That's his back leg with his knee/foot pointed towards the door.
---
Make a priest. Because cloth wearers typically make use of tailoring and enchanting the best, and with your penchant for wanting to help new players, you can give them bags and free enchants and heal them and buff them. Make them feel like a million bucks.
---
So much warrior and paladin loot that feels useless a couple of levels later because it's not plate. 
---
But at least it looks cool.
---
ah yes, the legendary tauren WILDMAN
---
Always kill elves blame them for ruining the horde camaraderie during TBC.
---
Gnome players a cool
---
I gave away so many bags to lowbies in Goldshire on the last server I played on that a GM appeared next to me to ask what the hell I was doing.
---
If it's blue it's... Doodoo?
---
You’ll do great and have a great time doing it! Do try to join a guild together with your IRL-buddies, it’s amazing fun playing with them in raids. The trick is that the first to hit 60 must wait for the rest or find a guild that can guarantee the friends spots aswell
---
Depends how the mount system is done. At patch 1.12 you didn't need rep.
---
the pros of being gay: no kids, bf plays hella video games too, still have a social life
---
im ready to fully commit to classic and still live my best life
---
Priests are good for healing of course, and giving stam buffs (or spirit buffs for disc).   paladin buffs in this way only last 5 minutes but you can still give a helping hand. They can provide a stun as well if someone is fighting an elite or something and need to escape or get some distance.. but priests can fear bomb but that can get dangerous.  buf if you're shadow you can mind flay for a slow... either is really find for what you want.
---
For me it's that you need to wear not-plate for bis healing early on that makes me not want to pally.
---
My first raid experience was in TBC as boomkin (balanced druid) in Gruul's Lair. I had a much needed role there, and it was quite the experience.
---
I expect a similar experience in wow classic once it comes out. It is well worth the wait.
---
If you want to make sure you get a shot at raiding, make a guild yourself with your friends
---
Bread sausage? I'm staying ally.
---
both. its a lot more immersive. you don't portal and zone and pop around instantly to every goal - you have to walk there. getting a mount makes you feel like a god and it takes a significant amount of time  
---
The game won't spoon feed you as much. Quests might actually require a group. You will have to talk to people instead of just Q for things. PUGs groups won't bulldoze low level content mindlessly, they will wipe often and you will learn to value good groups.   
---
It's better in every way in my opinion.
---
Plus that axe he drops is so good you can keep using it for trash for the rest of vanilla
---
noob question: You started in duskwood, how did you pull him to the other continent? Did loading zones on boats not reset it?
---
Congrats, I'm a multi-glad too, but it doesn't make me a vanilla expert.
---
If you can write a coherent post on reddit you're more than equipped for successful vanilla raiding. Really just do a few 5 mans on your way to 60 - generally in 5 mans you have more responsibility than in your average raid. With 40 people there's always healers and dps that will pick up the slack.  
---
All you have to do is let the raid leader know that you're new and they will make sure they explain any mechanics that you need to know about, but really these are very simple in tier 1 and 2 raiding and can all be thoroughly explained in 30 seconds. They're basically, *if the boss casts this on you, run over here*, and *don't stand in fire*, and *when these adds come, kill them*.   
---
Things get a bit more complicated in AQ/Naxx but by then you'll have spent many hours in raids and you'll be more than ready.
---
In the Warcraft timeline, year 0 is the start of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans.  Stormwind is destroyed shortly after that.
---
Tides of Darkness ends and Beyond the Dark Portal begins about year 7.  That is the absolute earliest Stormwind's reconstruction could begin.
---
Arthas is inducted into the Knights of the Silver Hand in year 15, at the rebuilt Stormwind Cathedral.  So, while the whole city may not be done at that time, Stormwind was rebuilt sometime between 7 and 15.  
---
Thrall escapes Durnholde in 23, and arrives in Kalimdore in 25.  Construction of Orgrimmar has begun at the start of the Orc campaign in Frozen Throne, which is in 26.  
---
WoW starts in 30.
---
So 19 is the absolute maximum from start of Stormwind to start of Orgrimmar.  End of Stormwind to start of Orgrimmar is 10-11 years.
---
I love paladin but you may not ever want to use plate until t3 so it sucks
---
So what is it about? Please educate me sempai.
---
These were already disabled before 1.12
---
You made my heart drop with hatred 😤
---
Well done...
---
Stoneform would like a word. 1/4 is worthless, I would rather be a nelf or human to get the jump on them. Orcs make terrible rogues, I would rather be literally anybody else. Saying 'gg you lose' doesn't make your point, it's just embarrassing.
---
Wellllll... He also min maxed. Like, real hard. Lol
---
It’s pretty ironic that you commented about someone else being unoriginal by basically copying another person’s comment.
---
1/4 isn't worthless when in a duel, you'll be afflicted by 4 stuns, and the rogue that gets an uninterrupted opener can kill the other one in a stunlock.
---
You have. ~70% chance of resisting at least one stun out of those 4.
---
So you could just pick which one you wanted and the rep grind wasn't attached?
---
Wowhobbs it up https://youtu.be/EN7KfJ7ZKXc
---
Good lokking out
---
Try to imagine “alliance” orcs rofl
---
&gt;  yes, but what about hardiness vs warstomp? Would a shaman be better off with warstomp in pvp vs stun resist? 
---
Actually for Shamans Warstomp is probably the best racial, but it's really because they're Shamans.  This is due to the fact Chain lightning has 1.5sec cast, and so has Healving wave. In PvP, getting that one 2 sec stun and free cast+Orion will save your life probably more often than Hardiness, which is random and may pop in the most useless moments while not happening in the ones you need it the most. 
---
Passive racials are entirely reliant on luck. Also, not all classes have stuns in Vanilla, far from that. Warstomp on the other hand can be used against all classes.
---
Look at that :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZapYnHSSsQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZapYnHSSsQ) . Ain't Warstomp useful ?
---
I don't think you should choose a class for racials though. It's just an elitist reddit trend, and nobody cared about that in Vanilla. If racials were that important there wouldn't be any PvP oriented undead mages/warriors/warlocks in Vanilla, nor would there be Night Elf hunters/Warriors, all alliance rogues would be dwarves, and so on ... Yet it's obviously not the case. All racials have their pros and cons, pick the race with the lore/looks/casting animation you prefer.
---
Kobolds?
---
Yessir I stole his comment explaining how the idea of posting a picture of your discs has been overdone. That makes perfect sense. Literally all I said was that it wasn’t an original idea sarcastically.
---
Thanks for clearing this up!
---
Ally has such a huge problem with kobolds. And horde those pig looking things. Cant remember the name

**patch 1.13.1**

New Gnome Racial:

Will of Gadgetzan
---
2 min cooldown
---
Removes all poison, stun, and chilled effects from the user. Useable while stunned.
---
No one here is trying to have an argument other than you.  Your opinion doesn't make my opinion wrong.  Frankly, I don't care what your opinion is.  I see you carrying on trying to convince people that their idea of fun is wrong.  You're just an idiot.  Go chant 'strawman' a few more times you moron.

Jason Hayes is on the credits as Lead Composer for vanilla. [Here's](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-world-of-warcraft-composer-jason-hayes/1100-6172231/) and interview with him.  
---
If you mean practically speaking, almost all music/tv show/video game music for the last 30 years has been done digitally with DAW software. A producer sits down with the producer/director/game designer and works out what the atmosphere/theme that will be needed and then digitally composes/mixes/edits sounds and loops into a song on a computer. Sometimes they record some special stuff but the majority of audio you here is synth or recorded libraries.
---
indeed in patch 1.12 they change it to a general Faction specifi riding skill. Priot to that it was split into
---
Race specific riding skills.  (tiger riding, horse riding, mechanostrider piloting, ram riding). Back then all Mounts were BoE thats why theres a Mount tab in the classic auction house. and u also needed the faction specific riding skill to ride the PVP Mount of another race. All mounts that dropped from Bosses how ever did not need any riding skill prior to 1.12. If you were really lucky and got Rivendares mount you could ride level 60 Mount with 100% without paying anything for it\^\^. If they use the 1.12 system wich is likely you can ride any PVP mount u want but getting to rank 11 is no easy task :)

This race conquered the Gnomes. Wrap your head around that.

Thanks buddy, youre probably right!
---
I thought that alot of people will roll Warrior and Tanks, but many say that Tanks will be rare... 
---
im happy about my baby agro ;)
---
It’s difficult for me to interpret tone on here so my apologies if I came across a little defensive. There just seems to be an awful lot of people with very strong opinions on how this game should be enjoyed and just wanted to stop any of that before it started. :-)
---
*hears fortunate son slowly getting louder*
---
I'm in danger!
---
It’s because you already know the end game answers. When you made characters back in the day you just one that sounded fun/cool and evolved as you leveled.

I’d love to try a mage - never have - but I know my personality isto tank. I’d never get a shot at TF as a mage.

---
BC in general, fighting over the Towers in Hellfire was awesome.
---
You misspelled Maraudon.
---
You also lost xp on death, which at higher levels could cost you 6h+ in xp. The only way around it was to pay a cleric to run to wherever your corpse was (could be easily 20mins +) and Rez you, which would restore ~90% of the lost xp
---
In their defense, runescape had a serious problem. People were literally crashing servers to kill other players in hopes of getting their loot.
---
some of the most pleasant memories I have are actually of the road there, it felt like such an adventure to have to travel those roads to get there (and I suppose on a PvE server without being griefed)
---
got my Undead Warlock. "Babydill" to lvl60, January 2nd, 2005. Why so quickly? because this guy dropped outta college 🙃
---
Hey guys, Madseason here
---
I’m pretty sure you had to be out of combat to use shadow meld in vanilla
---
I remember people thinking we needed to rewind DVDs when they first came out, lol
---
I agree 100% you can make your own fun in vanilla. This very much includes the entire leveling process.
---
Indeed. Kind of unbelievable that being sarcastic about an insanely overused post type nets you dislikes. I’ll be glad once the game is out and I don’t have to deal with the like of you anymore.
---
bro.. Vanilla is life

This has been covered many many times if you know where to look.

Every way to play is right as long as you enjoy it. You wrote you felt like you were in the minority but I just wanted you to know that it's not a problem at all and you'll find thousands of people like you in Classic :)

Teremus could be kited to Bolvar and let him kill it for the loot, did it a number of times with my hunter at 60! Dropped that blue gem/sphere which you could deliver for some sweet lvl 50+ boe rare items.

Get ready for a shit ton of fun.

70% of the time.

haha sage advice there! ;)

At 19 hunters are hands down the easiest, most of the gear comes from 5 mana.

For hardest hmm. I want to say Druid out of personal experience. The fishing hat alone is a fucking nightmare to get. Then there’s a quest in Felwood you have to do that for some reason didn’t have a level requirement.

Going to main a Undead Priest I think. Been playing Healer for the past 4-6 years (on and off).

Worse case, I'll be able to pvp as Shadow Priest.

I’m going PVP, but I get the draw of pve. Some people want to come home and put in a couple hours in another world, and not have to deal with the negatives, like getting camped by an ?? Undead rogue. I’m also glad that pve is an option, because then there truly is no right to complain when you choose PVP, you had an option :P

You clearly took my reply way too seriously and tried to make a big old argument where you were right and I wasn't.  You're an idiot.

 New News: "                                                                  "
---
There all of the new stories have been reported, back to the memes.
---
Really dig the art style and the Jojo reference
---
Why $11? Four months ($15×4) for $40 = $10/month
---
Very good point. It's also a good way to mingle with your server's population. A great healer in BRD is definitely someone you want on your friend list, for example.
---
It's both. You are dieing a lot because you are new and bad. Rogues are also the hardest class to level. So it's both.
---
Probably warlock then I think.
---
You have large cool downs to assist significantly with sustain. E. G. Vw sacrifice, siphon life, drain life, health stones which I don't believe shares CD with potion, trinket to summon Vw, cool down to summon Vw.
---
Those were 2010/11 memes
---
Look at end game armor for each class. Go based off that. If it looks cool it has to be cool.
---
Warriors are pretty fast levelers if you are a veteran. Rogues just suck. They are the hardest class to level. I am not counting paladins because they aren't people.
---
Promise them that you will always be on whenever they plan on being on to play together. Tie their enjoyment of classic directly to yours in a way that will surely make experience fun for the both of you.
---
Yeah you can't shadow meld in combat in vanilla
---
Hi, /u/korasuma
---
Maybe I’m just the bad guy here but u won’t be able to freely cast fort on people because the mana cost is just so costly. I think 3-4 cost nearly 1k mana. It’s so taxing on ur mana.  I like pallets better. I’d rather have kings or wisdom buff for a caster imo.
---
Paladin is easy but onesided in terms of healing.
---
Priest is versatile but a little more demanding.
---
Paypal's a politically weaponized company. Garbage humans
---
fortnite xd
---
One of these classes has to serve as a human vending machine for the rest of 40 man raid.
---
Classic is the very definition of grind. Make some friends and get in with a nice Guild.
---
Hey fat chicks need love too.
---
It’s a shame that the 1-60 experience got spoiled. I’m sure there’s still plenty of zones and dungeons to visit for your first time, but it’s always sad to hear people spoil it all in a 10 hr play through on a bloated mess of a game :/
---
Sorry to be so negative, haha. I’m glad you’re gonna give Classic a shot after your dissapointments. Classic is still a grind, but it’s a grind disguised as a journey. In level ups that give you talent points, skills, and new content to do. In sweet green/blue drops that feel amazing to get, and in the people you meet and stay connected with.
---
There will be casual guilds on every server that will welcome you in. Just try to avoid “cesspool guilds” that are just trying to inflate their numbers by spamming the ever living shit out of the planet. Try to find a nice friendly guild, that doesn’t have too much bickering, but plenty of banter. Sometimes a dungeon run will have a handful of huildies, and if they seem cool, ask them if they like their guild, and ask for an invite.
---
Yeah expansions aren't games
---
Are you reading the same graph I am ? Read it again lol
---
I was in college when I played vanilla as well, and I definitely consider myself to have been a dumb, young kid at 19. :P
---
Priest or Paladin comes down to this:
---
Do you want to be mad when a Paladin takes your cloth gear?
---
Do you want the Priest mad at you when you take his cloth gear?
---
Nope. I used to run around TM ganking lowbies when I got bored.
---
I suppose those do not stack from different Paladins even when there are limited debuff slots? Or do they?
---
Possibly in 1.12 actually.  I vanilla wow started with wotf having a 20 second duration, which is pretty insane.
---
In limbo on what to go atm, had my heart set on Ally as a Paladin but my friends are going Horde so I started thinking of going Shaman if I remember rightly they were a bit of a beast back in Vanilla. Since thinking this I've seen a lot of threads where people claim they've regretted playing Shaman, they were like the rest of the hybrids, boring etc. Enhancement isn't as good as they say it is in pvp as well as elemental being very gear dependant. I want to pvp a lot but I'd also like to raid as resto, wouldn't mind by some miracle getting hand of rag for pvp? Alternatively I've considered going pure dps such as Warlock or Mage.
---
Why does he have like 7 fingers on one hand
---
I mean, any news from a blue post is going to be pinned to the top of this subreddit in like, 7 seconds. So any news really shouldn’t go over your head. 
---
Bring on the memes, but pls do have second thoughts. If you ask yourself “Hm, is this really shitty?” then it’s really shitty.
---
I plan on doing all of them once for the quests. Doing dungeons is one of the most fun parts of WoW. I'm not treating the game like a job, just trying to have fun.
---
I consistently topped the DPS meter on Broodlord.
---
Thats literally my biggest holdup right now. I really dont wanna wear a dress for 18 months.

LMFAO. Yep, totally this. Would love a perfect class/level gear rolling restriction as a QoL change.
---
You very much could. I spend a lot of time roaming around Undercity. FD and meld were how you got around
---
is it much different to the UD area? the two key things from 1-14 imo are keeping on top of first aid, and your three white weapon upgrades from vendors (Gladius @4, Cutlass @10, Scimi @14 assuming no green drop/wc)
---
Priest is the superior healer and have a Stamina buff. Paladins are good healers, have lots of various buffs, and are less squishy. 
---
Sounds like both would work for you, but more than likely Priest is the answer to your question.
---
Indeed it actually might. Depends entirely on the actual DoT numbers, at the end of the day.
---
Heh, as someone else pointed out, bad specs are bad with or without DoTs, and I admit he's spot on :)
---
What the class brings to the raid. Utility, buffs, auras dps whatever.DPS/hps are just one of them.
---
 Warlocks have terrible dps early on but you will always want multiple of them for their utility, hunters too.
---
I'm in the same boat, I'm really trying to stay off of any ps right now. Apex luckily had been a good distraction.
---
These have to be private server bugs surely
---
Jesus Christ this is idiotic.
---
I’m sure everyone was thinking that in all the wars that have ever happened.
---
“They have more people we already lost!”
---
Let’s just say I wouldn’t want to go to war with you. Let alone take a 5v10 in Silithus.
---
You act as if things happen in a perfect world scenario, which is never the case.
---
Some people have better latency, skill, more time invested (more consumes).
---
To lump everything together is just flat out wrong.
---
And if everything was TRULY equal would it not just come down to skill or innovation?
---
I’m baffled by your answer
---
Yikes that's terrible. There was and is no cell reception in the canyon so that wasn't even an option for me.
---
There is a guy who moved out there that has been catching an over the air signal that is transmitted off the Caldecott tunnel in Oakland and using that for internet... But he's just a single guy running the program and he can only incorporate one house at a time. That internet is pretty solid though supposedly, mediocre latency but decent throughput. My uncle was one of the first to get hooked up with it out here.
---
Maybe in the next 5 years my dad can join the age of the internet lol.
---
&gt;good ol' days

&gt;2011 memes
---
Whoa. A zoomer around these parts. That's pretty rare.
---
Jason Hayes worked on most of WoW’s music and he is a legend and unfortunately I don’t think he’s with Blizzard anymore.
---
Herod is actually one of the few bosses who can be harder in retail then in vanilla.
---
Almost wiped on him the other day because he swept up everyone but two and killed us dead.
---
I've ran every single 0-60 instance last couple days and the only dungeon that's even *approached* hard was Stratholme.   
---
Granted I've been tanking them all and I'm quite frankly a kickass tank (well, I was before I quit 7 years ago) but even so. They take absolutely zero thought, bosses are normal mobs with more HP &gt;.&lt;
---
Because it’s a reference to a Japanese manga, jojos bizarre adventure
---
2012, actually.
---
I bought a sit/stand adjustable desk so I can easily transition between WoW and the next step of my recipe while cooking.  
---
Also because after about 6 hours of playing, my ass bone hurts with a pain I've never felt before. A deep deep body pain that has no relief.  
---
If I plan on playing 16-18 hours a day for the first two weeks, I'm going to need to stand up for 1/3rd of it.
---
It's one of the reasons ganking is so frustrating and a big deal. At some places it takes a good while to run to your corpse only to be instantly killed again. Add in the increased ress timer and the only other options being quit playing or get resurrection sickness which itself already makes things harder but also the durability hit was costly.
---
After this topic and the (few but existent) good counterarguments given to my original position I am forced to agree that the debuff limit is best left untouched.
---
In a hindsight sort of way I still think Vanilla might've been better off built and balanced without a debuff limit. But that is already just personal opinion and a total what-if that is not at all relevant to the topic statementtopic.
---
Pretty sure Herod got replaced with a different character in Cata, or sometime after that.
---
The only thing that ever came close to classic was Isle of Quel'danas. Classic is the goat for WPVP. Flying mounts murdered it.
---
Nah. I'm a PvE carebear so I'll just /wave at every enemy faction I see.
---
I have played on Pvp servers, RP servers, in "servers first" guilds, organized pvp, but my fondest memory is leveling my rogue back when wow was released. Trying to figure out the best spec, heart beating in every pvp confrontation, doing dungeons for the very first time. I would trade all accumulated epics for the ignorance. Would love to experience it all again. So my advice, such as it is, is if you haven't played the game before, take your time. Enjoy it. Eventually you will catch up with the rest, but the journey there will be something you will always remember.
---
Pallies - more throughout on most fights due to efficiency. More desirable for 40ms, you will always have a priest for steam, but not always 4 pallies for the necessary blessings. More dull to level. Less squishy. Smaller healing toolkit. More fun spec options.
---
Priest - easier to level, still always wanted, MASSIVE toolkit, possibly better for 5mans.
---
Personally, I can’t decide, but I’ve been leaning towards Pally for a while. After writing out this post, I realize that I can think of way more positives for Pallies.
---
yes and no. the buffs are 5 minutes but their raid version is 15 minutes.. requires a reagent though.. priest buffs are 30 minutes but their raid versions are an hour and require a reagent.
---
Yes, at higher levels. But til 56 or so, I believe it’s only 5m buffs.
---
Blizzard has used a lot of actual live orchestra in their music, since at least Cataclysm.
---
This is actually just a meme from an anime. OP just replaced the characters with WoW art. (And did a phenomenal job I should mention)
---
palm pilot mage
---
Yep. I’ve been playing the role of ganker, myself, lately. Not killing grays or anything, just ppl my level... but it’s always fun when they take their revenge by catching me out and 4v1ing me, or get their ?? Friends to help. 
---
Never really try to camp, or I’ll get quickly found by a 60. But even when I’m the gankee, so long as it’s not a ?? Camping me, I never mind too much. It’s a price of being in a wild-west type anything goes server that I will happily pay.
---
This is why if i do stonetalon i will be over leveled and only do the EZ quests. NO harpy area of death.
---
Awesome job my dude!
---
That's one hell of a time commitment. I did long sessions daily in vanilla, but won't have that time available now. Working 12 hours graveyard just won't allow that. I'm still hoping to get a lot done each time.
---
I'm planning on horde, and i get this is a "pro-horde" post, but damn if it didnt make me want to swap.
---
Guess i'll get my fill of better looking zones when ganking.
---
How would you say Orcs racial Command and Hardiness compare to Shadowmeld for PvP?
---
Honestly, it's probably too late to level all the way, but knowing your route 1 - 20 is a pretty good start.
---
Blizzard has used a lot of actual live orchestra/choir in their music, since at least Burning Crusade. You can go check the credits of their soundtracks and they credit various Orchestras. Most often the Northwest Sinfonia Orchestra and Chorus.

Not that I'm complaining, but did they really need to put wotf on the same faction that they gave tremor totem?
---
Just a thought.
---
Most people gained more responsibilities as they grew older. Somehow I decided I don't want all that crap and now I have more free time than ever before.  
---
Of course if I get fired from my job i'm totally screwed because I'll never find another one that lets me work as leisurely as I do, but you know.
---
You kite and cast instant spells. Like wtf are you trying to face tank here or what. If dmg pushback is a problem for you you are either outnumbered or playing it wrong 
---
Arcane missles is used when people try to LoS you as it persist through walls
---
Frost is the far superior pvp spec, fight me grrr
---
Just play at your own pace dude. Whilst there is a pre-raid BiS, you hardly need the whole thing for MC nor Onyxia. Just don't stand in fire and bring some consumables like fire resist.
---
No friend of mine turns down classic! Scrubs.
---
Its been a while but I remember AVR. I think the main point of it is it clearly indicated the boarder of ground AOE stuff. Having it for fights like [Putricide](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=36678/professor-putricide#abilities) was so good cause you could clearly see where to stand to not take damage. It was hard to tell where you would take damage with those green cloud things.
---
The fun thing is if by level 20 you don’t like it you can roll something else. Maybe later you’ll come back and finish that other toon maybe not. There is no wrong way to play classic wow. There certainly is inefficient ways but if your having fun who cares.
---
Not sure if it was a patch or what but I was rank 11 in vanilla and purchased and used all of the epic mounts without even having anything above level 40 riding skill.

I remember the good ole days when I knew how to translate into the other faction...
---
&gt; I'm probably turning into a grumpy old man 
---
Yep
---
Is that his Twitch channel?  
---
Dude says no to playing WoW like it's some kind of horrible cancer game, yet he has videos of Fornite on his Twitch.  
---
Choosing quality games over crap games I can see.
---
Has it been confirmed that classic will use this style of macro? I sure hope so, it was so much easier to use and more powerful than what they had in vanilla.
---
Assuming you are actually going to be playing 12-16 hours a day, you won't have a problem hitting 60 within that timeframe. 
---
Also don't get your pants in a bunch to get all the pre-raid BiS. It will help but you hardly need all of them to raid. Just don't stand in fire and being some consumables like fire resist.
---
Cool, I'd imagine things changed a bit for blizzard pre and post WoW launch, all department budgets got a few more zeroes.
---
Tidy room, no single dust grain: „found something“
---
Polls aren’t an accurate representation of what people will play.
---
Shaman.
---
LOL GOT ME. I’m glad I’m not alone.
---
Wish you were horde :(
---
If you're already planning on raiding as resto and doing enhancement or elemental for PvP, I think you'll have a great time. PvP is the place where hybrids shine because they have a varied toolset. Elemental shaman in particular are really bursty with damage, which is ideal for PvP. Since you'll already have a lot of INT gear, you'll be able to toss heals when needed, use frost shock / earthbind totem for spacing against melee, use fire nova totem to unstealth rogues, etc. It's very strong for PvP. Enhancement has huge crits and windfury procs, but it's more RNG based that I like.
---
No idea what he's named but it's the same bid essentially. Dungeons are over so quickly I never pick up on the named unless I actually recognise them from Vanilla :/
---
"just get friends" yeah bro if it was that easy ....
---
shamans are pink in vanilla
---
Not Duskwood, that's Aszhara.
---
If you can get some plate INT gear, then holy paladin is absurdly hard to kill. You won't kill anyone else, but you're going to feel pretty damned invincible. Of course, you'd have to roll Alliance. So if you can handle that black mark on your soul, go for it.
---
I always thought about getting one, for years now actually, but I never did it.  I feel like I'm just too far into the game at this point to buy one lol.
---
He's talking about elemental
---
I would worry more about getting tired of leveling than getting practice in, but that's just me.
---
R11 Black Warsaber is one of my main goals in classic.  Was my fav mount on my Human Rogue
---
Well quit basing your choices on the limits of the class. Within reason what you need to ask yourself is what toll do I want to play the most in 5 mans, what roll am I willing to do raids as. Do I want to be a MT an OT a healer a warm body. Then from your answers there pick your class. For me I want to tank why because I have control issues and I love being needed. In raids I want to MT again. I didn’t become a tank till BC and pally healed vanilla. So with those two questions answered there’s only one class that fits the bill which is warrior. My cousin has a bit harder time because he wants to heal where there’s three of those. So he looks at what he doesn’t like about certain specs to rule them out. So far he’s ruled out druid just because he does a ton of 5 mans and doesn’t want the headache of not having out of combat Rez. He leveled up a shaman a year ago and felt a bit weak as a fresh 60 healer but he hasn’t ruled that class out. I personally think he’s leaning towards priest atm just because he prefers the tool kit just a bit more than shaman. So yeh it’s difficult but you’ll know if you like a class by lvl 20 and that only takes around 20h-25h.
---
The thing is tho, that in a PvP server their time spend may be more rewarding.
---
My usual example is between perma death and non perma death in games. If you could play "perma death"-mode in WoW it would be as rewarding to play 1 hour as it would have been to play multiple hours in non-perma death. (With a diminishing return if you do not keep getting further and further over time).
---
It might be more relaxing to play on a PvE server, i'll give it that. But if you are looking to get as much "fun" out of the game as possible in as small windows as possible then PvP servers are probably better.
---

Fk off ya judgemental clown!!

Get one of the baby carriers that wraps around you like [this one](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Rnx9QtsOL._SY355_.jpg). I carried my kid around for months in that thing and he loved it. Before they crawl they're really easy for gamers. Once they get mobile you'll have a year or so before they get independent enough to want to do their own thing without constant attention, but the first months prior to the crawling is really easy. They're cute, warm, and they love to be cuddled. I gamed all the time with my son in one of those carriers. 
---
Congrats, by the way!
---
I told you already! No vegetables on the ferry!
---
Enitsu in Enitsu Jir PvP  
---
Also featuring in Jir Enitsu 2 Mage Hunter PvP
---
guess it’s time to start writing the pros and cons for 5 mans with each and then raiding. Then you may have an easier choice.
---
Does the xp penalty apply at max level too??
---
Thank you! :)
---
Lol. This kid has no idea who EBaum is.
---
I was horde during vanilla but I'm going Gnome for classic.
---
Time to fight for the other side! Gnome lives matter!
---
Druid T1 looks cool but is hot garbage.
---
Leveling as a druid isn't bad at all.
---
If I could shadowmeld in combat we wouldn't be having this conversation, you definitely can't.
---
Druid is actually a rather quick leveling path as feral.
---
I was lolret until ZF. when I first played I installed a dps meter around the time I got to SM and man was I shit.  So by the time we hit ZF i got rolled paladins heal and I was like what. Ran the dungeon a few times picking up cloth went holy and slowly reached 60. I had a love hate relationship with my pally. I was a good healer i became paladin class leader aka the guy yelling to rebuff every 30min or wipe and assigning buffs. But man I hated my paladin solo in the open world I was an inefficient poor player.
---
Out of all the videos I’ve watched for months now I’m going to choosing Druid as my main for sure... the WPvP looks like it’s just too much fun to pass up.. I’ve always wanted a max level Druid and I’m going for it. The fights you can manipulate to your advantage appeal to me more than any other character pvp style. Also you can farm dungeons which I love and you get stealth which coming from my main always being a rogue I also appreciate
---
This is beautiful thank you!
---
Would prefer not meeting Fortnite players in Classic, no thanks.
---
I played retail starting in Cata and joined a heroic progression guild, defeating Deathwing a week before MoP dropped. It was so satisfying
---
If you spec feral with gear focusing on AP (raw str+Dex as a druid) you level exceptionally quick.
---
Your cat form DPs is not bad, you can escape any fight by running away, easily stealth to quest objectives or hide from gankszl, and can heal yourself as you passively regen mana while in bear/cat form on top of increased movement speed from cat form and travel form.
---
Oh, and you also have some gear independence as your weapon damage is irrelevant as its just a stat stick.
---
&gt; Has it been confirmed that classic will use this style of macro?  
---
[sort of.](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2494)  
---
&gt; it was so much easier to use and more powerful than what they had in vanilla.  
---
Easier, yes. More powerful? - not at all. Using the old API you could code very powerful macros and addons that could pretty much play the game for you.
---
Nope, he works for Valve now.  It kind of explains why DOTA2's music is kind of vanilla-esque.
---
Now kith.
---
Feral is one of the fastest classes to level. Shadow Priest is also a top tier leveler so you’re probably doing something wrong.
---
Corsair scimitar pro.
---
If you think you would enjoy it wolith burning yourself out by the time classic laun
---
Look, it really isn't bad, but it isn't as great as they claim either, and it's all you get as a rogue. Also blind and gouge and incapacitates, not stuns. A lot of rogue duels wont even see a single KS thrown. Besides, for every big time KS resist, there are tons where you resist a charge stun and get hit by a HOJ or something. It does mean people are less likely to try and stun you, but it just means they will prioritize different moves for you. Like fear, or opening with ambush or garrote.
---
I played fresh horde side and the Rune quest wasn’t available, not sure when it was added.
---
The thing, the time commitment for raiding, and even PvP, isn't a requirement of the game. It's all player created.
---
Same. I built a new desk in preparation for it. Getting a new ultrawide monitor. I can't wait.
---
- Balance Druid: deadweight
---
- Feral DPS Druid: deadweight
---
- Feral Hybrid Druid: guild mascot, can perform decently in multiple roles, not as viable as “pure classes”, but can be alright with dedication
---
- Hunter: Tranq bot
---
- Arcane Mage: doesn’t exist in Classic
---
- Prot Pala: deadweight
---
- Ret Pala: deadweight
---
- Shadow Priest: debuff bitch for Warlocks and a drain on consumables, one per raid at most
---
- Enhancement Shaman: deadweight, can be a Nightfall bitch in theory, has a terrible progression in practice due to vanilla itemization
---
- Elemental Shaman: deadweight DPS/mediocre healer with no mana tide totem for players who are just too poor to respec
---
- DPS Warrior: one of the most viable DPS classes
---
Priests rely mostly on wands for damage... Only a few attack abilities.
---
Um I don’t think he’s gonna play till his twitch subscriber count drops from everyone watching classic wow.
---
Except for druid.
---
I said screw that normal working crap as well for a year. But then my bank account said stop that. Lol
---
kek
---
didnt check but i think you mean world of roguecraft videos
---
I leveled a druid in a pserver and I loved it. Wpvp was fun and i could easily join groups for dungeons. This is my opinion: if you want to have fun, go with a druid. If you want to make wow a job, go with warrior.
---
Druid is one of the faster classes to level, due to increased move speed in cat and later travel form. Plus you shouldn’t have much down time, as you can self heal between mobs and regen the mana back while you fight in cat. Shadow is also exceptionally strong due to spirit tap, if you manage your mana properly you never stop (dot, mind flay 1-2 times, wand to finish last 50%). Can share a priest levelling guide if you need. Perhaps the wanding makes it feel boring but guarantee you it’s a lot easier than say rogue or warrior levelling.
---
You want to be a mage but you want to take. The answer is be a druid.
---
You know, most people are asking if their class of choice is bad to level.
---
Nothing is bad leveling if you play with a group.
---
Bro don’t worry about us vets we want you new players hooked. We will teach you gear you be friend you and eventually leave you. Yeh there will be shit stains that are jerks because I’ve beaten max in vanilla git gud nub but those guys are going to be a minority. Personally if someone tells me they are new I’m just going to let them know if they ever want some info or honest opinions they can message me. If they need help and I’m not busy I’m avaialable but that’s going to benefit me because the more friends you have the more fun you can have.
---
To answer your title first, Druids are arguably the best levels behind Hunters.  You can go from tank to healer in the same dungeon if the group needed.  I personally think Druids are the most fun while leveling because they don't have glaring weaknesses until endgame.  Mid 20's until laye 30's Druids are the strongest PvP class imo.  It's kinda all down hill from Lv40+.
---
One of the biggest issues with Druids is that they are anything but heavy hitters.  Druids lack CC and burst damage.  If you want to play a Druid like a rogue with a different skin then you'll be very disappointed.  Understand that Druid is a class and not a spec, much the opposite of a Shadow Priest.  You'll have to use all of your abilities and fluidly move between rolls to do well as a Druid and even then you'll be worse most of the time.
---
You really have to embrace being the underdog.  There's a reason they aren't played much.  But I love them anyway.  Good luck
---
With a proper wand spec, I feel priests can be second or third fastest levelers behind pet classes. There are a ton of videos on this, it’s worth checking out if you’re worried priest will be too slow. I think you’d be pleasantly surprised.
---
ZAWA ZAWA

I used to play on my brother warrior when he was working night shift, they knew it was me for 2 thing.
---
Never spoke in vent

Dps was worst by alot, i was playing warlock, i binded shadowbolt to mouse wheel en scroll it endlessly while watching tv, i was not familiar with more than 1 spell in a rotation 😝

We farmed pvp honor for the rank14 togethers theres was 2 version of this warrior the face smashing warrior with the best gear on the server and the wtf noobs warrior with the best gear on the server

Tried to level a Pally on a pserver recently. I’ve managed to save a Rogue in trouble by stunning a mob and healing her, then we partied up and did some quests. The player was most likely quite new to Classic as she constantly overpulled, but fortunately my bubbles and stun saved her the first time she did that, until she pulled like five mobs. So I bubbled myself, ran away till I lost aggro, rezzed her and we proceeded to continue questing.
---
If I weren’t a Horde player, it’d be my class choicr and I’m still considering it as Dwarves are my 2nd favourite race in Classic, but I’d likely miss my mudhuts in Orgrimmar.
---
I know this was half a month ago, but I agree with you. And the biggest thing that people in this thread missed is that they're too focused on the rank 12,13,&amp;14 gear which will take months minimum to get that's true  - but they forget that the Rank 7,8,&amp;9 gear is actually insanely good, better than t1 for a lot of classes and will not take very long to get. 
---
Blizzard 100% needs to either release this gear later or downgrade it to the pre 1.12 stats. 
---
"only no-lifers will go for them" is such a lame excuse people in this thread are using too. r/wowclassic users are completely oblivious sometimes.
---
Yep. You could max out your exp at 60 though so you wouldn’t de level for awhile. But still. You fuck up enough you could.
---
