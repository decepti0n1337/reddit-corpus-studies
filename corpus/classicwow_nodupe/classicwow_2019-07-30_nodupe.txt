Damn this was too real, i didn't expect to be personally attacked like this today.

---
I wont be joining your guild. But Holy crap I loved following Risen's progress back in the day. I still have your old website bookmarked, too bad most the progress pics have been lost to time.
---

---
These people were top raiders in their day. Assuming it's the same Risen I think it is. Though I thought the GM was named Failure(at least in game)

---
If friend 1 is also considering hunter, that would be better, so that loot is spread out more.  He could take all the agility leather and mail.
---
I even didn't read this post

You don’t need gear for UBRS.  A player who knows the basics of tanking and dps and healing in instances will be just fine.

Are you dyslexic or something?  I am offering a suggestion for an easy way people can increase the difficulty on content they are worried might be too easy.
---
that's a genius idea O_o 
---
think of all the drama we'll be doing with that!
---
Similar but I lived in a house with 4 others who all played in the same guild. Sadly I think only two of us are going to give classic a whirl.
---
It happens sometime. I've spent some time playing on private servers, but for some people it's been a loooong time :)
---
When I got to experience that in the stress test, it really helped killing my excitement lol.
---
I'm making my Hunter a Tauren just because I never see them.
---
soul bags don't give you more inventory spaces, they just gives you more soul shards
---
BR games too. PUBG and Apex were SO FUN when they first launched and no one really knew how to play. Its completely different now that everyone is so good.  
---
Ive been thinking about this same thing too and have been trying to prepare myself for it. I was a god in vanilla and TBC pvp but almost everyone was terrible at that time. It wont be the same, but I dont really think I even want to focus on pvp so much this time around anyways.
---
Why would you not use it on tanks and healers, it does the same dmg for everyone and by far the best for every class.
---
The only exception on pservers was alch because lotus were bound but classic they arnt.
---
good point each to there own my dude, I did read some reviews on both, I do own however the Razer blade 15 from last year as my gaming "rig" was trying to matchy matchy everything

Except not using add-ons and macros don't increase the difficulty of the game, just reduces mouse clicking, clutter and tedium. Vanilla WoW was an easy game with or without macros and add-ons. The 'difficulty' is from the time sink, the sheer number of spells, and the hassle of managing to get the proper number and set up of people together AND paying attention to clear content.
---
how exactly do you imagine I am 'asshurt' from my post?  I am more inclined to think that the excess of extremely hostile replies are coming from people who are 'asshurt' that some of what i said might have hit too close to home.
---
Whirlwind is between 5 to 10% of your total DPS. Slower weapons with comparable stats are obviously better, but weapon speed affects fury warriors way less than rogues.
---
The aesthetics and the music, it's just perfect tbh.
---
this comment oozes "i am a faggot"
---
Why should he? Honest question, is the game bad? I've not heard of it
---
My kid is not kindergarten anymore now he will raid with me and kicks my but in pvp. Been telling him to move back in so we can get myself rank 14 he just wont go for it. I was in my 30s during vanilla and could sit there for hours playing now not so much so i will be more of a casual player. On the plus side i can afford whatever pc i want now unlike back then.
---
This is a long shot but just throwing it out there. Looking for a guild that's active after midnight on the west coast. PVP relm, prefer alliance but horde is not a deal-breaker. Will probably main a warrior.
---
I agree with this. I leveled 1 back in the day and 1 on private servers. The pserver one I enjoyed WAY more than mage. Mage is horrible imo. 
---
Stealth is huge . Amazing for avoiding ganks or setting them up - sometimes you just stealth around following somebody until they pull more than they can handle and you just f em up when they are vulnerable. You get to really earn the hatred of other players as a rogue when you chew on their dead gnome feet.
---
I wouldn't say all of those are common. Yes you are usually meant to do your best in raids which includes playing a proper spec and using consumables when necessary.   
---
Topping meters is only really a tangible thing for very few people as vanilla is extremely unbalanced, most people don't care.   
---
The head/heart world buffs are really easy to get, just show up in SW/Org and you'll get them if you're on time. Some scheduling will probably happen on Classic though. The DM, songflower and DMF buffs are a bit trickier and consequently very few guilds require them. Actually I've never been in a guild that required them and I've been in several top 5 guilds on private servers. 
---
Few care about world or server firsts either. There will be a few guilds shooting for it but the vast majority will just do it on their own schedule.
---
Lastly, this mentality of min-maxing like crazy and spending a ton of gold on consumables really only starts happening towards the end of vanilla. You don't need these things in MC/BWL, but once you get into AQ and especially Naxxramas you kinda have to poopsock the raids a bit. That's just how vanilla is and it was the same back in the day.
---
How does a server's population inflating then eventually suddenly deflating by about 10% mean balancing out? The anti-fan to fan ratio probably isn't 1:1.
---
My issue isn’t really nostalgia. My main motivator is I’ve really been in the mood to play WoW for a while as have the rest of my friends. But every time we play retail it feels utterly unplayable.
---
T2 on a Warlock is one of the coolest looking sets in the game right behind T2 Paladin.
---
Or their aesthetics
---
I haven't played wow (or any computer games) in 8+ years, so i'm really worried about if my computer will hold up to 2019 graphics.  I have a 2018 macbook pro. Nothing special but it does all my daily non gaming tasks.  Is the main issue with lag basically the increase in graphics from 2004 to 2019? Cause I was running at like 20-30fps even in raids back in 05' on a shitty ass computer.
---
1 Elemental Shaman
---
1 Enhancement Shaman
---
3 Warriors, of any type.
---
Dishonorable Kills. I probably won't join any pvp raids, because of the risk of loosing hours or days of pvp progress, just becasue somebody in the raid killed a civilian.
---

Slowly backs away....
---
As a hunter player, the only talents that I have to put any thought into are tier 2 and 3 survival talents in 2/31/18 and 0/20/31. The rest is very obvious.
---
Blizzard = Jody confirmed.
---
More like stocky gnomes than anything
---
&gt;Yes, I know, it’s a MINOR change, but please, we’re trying to replicate Vanilla to its core here.
---
I feel like we have very different definitions of the word "core".
---
Layering is a bigger threat to Vanilla's core than dumb skeletons.
---
He would then be better off as a warrior, especially when you are leveling together and he can have heals.
---
y'all forgot about mankrik's wife
---
Alright I should probably rephrase that, most people who've dug deep and read/played a lot of Vanilla tends to know that Orc is the best, since their stun resist racial is extremely broken.
---
Not many opportunities to use WotF since the only class you have an issue with that also has a fear effect are warriors, and they'd need to get into melee to use it.
---
But, Cannibalize is a nice boon for leveling and niche uses in 1vX scenarios.
---
My cat.
---
I've had a lot of cats, but this one was special. Every time I sat down at my computer to play games she was there, sitting at my feet, staring at me. Every time I moved or made a noise she would sit up on her back legs and pat at the arm of my chair. I ended up getting it a stool to sit on beside me and she'd just sit and watch me and occasionally pat at my arm and purr at me.
---
I didn't leave the house a lot as a teenager, technically I still don't, so most of my time was spent with that cat beside me. Gonna be weird playing Classic without her there.
---
ANY REASON IN PARTICULAR?
---
I am going to level 16 to 60 running only dungeons on at least 5 of my characters. Plan on getting all the classes to 60, all horde and a paladin.
---
Yes, but the one with engineering will still win.
---
It's probably one that I had done the least, it was kinda inconvenient to get to for alliance.

What was your guilds name?
---
I sent him a message on Discord complimenting his work.
---
No such thing as girlfriends when you playing vanilla bruh
---
Auto-unshifting
---
Wild growth
---
Travelform-mountspeed
---
None of those things are bop nor do they require 60, and sappers and dragonlings dont scale off anything on beta
---
Is everyone trying level as fast as they can? I don't get it see posts like this all the time, about poeple worried how long leveling is going to take the.. I for one will be a solo player in chat spamming for a dungeon.
---
Anyone know if something like this exists for other classes? Shaman maybe? This is great!
---
In retail ive had for the past 2 expansions all 12 classes at max lvl. In legion i had two extra. So no, i wont be maining 9 classes in classic.
---
Ill be maining mage. And when i hit 60 and i have gotten an epic mount and pre bis ill level some alts on a second account.
---
I remember spending two weeks in duskwood  being greeted by the “corpse of fishmarket” a naked human male at the FP darkshire I would miss it if this couldn’t happen again
---
Technically it should be possible. In theory, Outlands as a zone (and therefore content) has never been touched outside the level scaling. I vaguely remember what you're referring to, perhaps in relation to the Corrupters waltzing around in the Ogri'la zone. Maybe the quests and drops are still there.
---
Does not seem like a big issue at all
---
Just brings back memories of how I didn't realize I could tame a pet until level 30
---
Or did you mean when vanilla was retail? I was a warrior main back then with warlock, mage, rogue, shaman and hunter alts above 40 and 50.
---
So kinda, since ill be a mage main this time.
---
That's pretty bullshit.  
---
People aren't burned out on other games that have a similar lifespan, the "content" that's there in retail now is just complete shit.
---
Nooma nooma noomaeh
---
Be a warlock
---
I'm sorry glancing at the UI to see a debuff is so hard for you, but these things aren't difficult. Half of what you're talking about isn't possible. You can't have add ons that automate actions for you. Blizz nixed Decursive. You also can't have a macro cast more than one spell on one click. You can't macro FD and Freeze Trap to go off automatically. You *can* make a cast sequence macro to cast FD, then cast FT on next click. Having it on one macro reduces clutter instead of using two action slots. A clicker might prefer having them separate for visual ease, anyway. Yes, you can equip items with a stance change within one macro but it saves two clicks and can't be done in combat. For the trinket, it's either a mouse click or a button press and the speed of those executions depends on the player. All of these things are either ease of access things, clutter reducers, or time savers for those who rather press buttons over clicking a mouse.
---
Psst it doesn't really matter they both end up just as good
---
Well it's a good thing there's still plenty of time to fix the bu- oh.
---
&gt; Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen
---
looks a bit memey tbh. might be good anyway
---
The only thing I remember from Sen'jin alliance side was some guy ninjaed a krol blade and he was constantly in trade chat starting drama.
---
Heh, just wait until someone in your alliance marudon group leaves, so you need to send a  player back to ironforge to spam general chat until you find a person, then you have to fly to menithil harbor, take the boat to darkshore, then fly down to sentinel hill ( assuming you picked up the flight paths), then ride (assuming you can afford a mount), across 70% of desolace, and be sure to meet up at the correct entrance without dying to the mobs outside the dungeon which have already respawned or a horde rogue, cause then you have to walk across 70% of the zone again but this time as a ghost. Curses, why didn't I roll night elf, I could be back in the instance a full minute faster!
---
Portals are way overused now, but partying with a warlock or mage had it's benefits back in the day.
---
because it's a really good game?
---
What ever happened to the annual Running of the Gnomes?? That event was HUGE for many years.. haven’t seen one in several years.
---
aah okay! i was also sure its magic and dispellable. thanks!
---
Same, I have leveled all the priest races to 60 (except human), NE has the most unique game play and is most fun to play in my opinion.
---
You cannot compare any other games to wow in this discussion, the expansions and changes to each expansion and emotional investment involved in bringing a character through 15 years while more or less going through the same checklist after you hit maximum level at the end of each expansion? This is a Warcraft only thing. People are burned out on WOW. That's inevitable, that's how the brain works.
---
And yeah, people could get burned out of other games if they play them for 15 years, thing is that you are not an objective judge of the current content because your opinion is affected by how much you chose to play in the past. That affects your perception.
---
HotW is calling for you:)

Can confirm. Was not in beta. Am able to download classic from launcher.

Not having classic addon/macro capability. The modern api is way, way too restrictive imo.

Video rental stores. Games that didn't have DLC and in-game purchases. Nokia cell phones, and just old 'dumb' phones in general.
---
I hear you, it's definitely possible to optimize a group so that everyone has engineering and still fulfills all of the other farming needs. I'm saying it's not realistic to expect your entire guild to have the coordination and time dedication, unless you're going hardcore. I just wouldn't call it mandatory for pve.
---
i dont get it..ive tried to use discord like 20 times..every time it failed...cant join the server, or i cant speak...or cant type in it cause of some shit...    
---
its literally the worst speaking platform ive ever tried in my 20 years of gaming..im only fkin 29, and im good with computers...this shit though...its like alien...gimme back ventrillo or teamspeak
---
You noob. I'm single.
---
Is hydraxian waterlords just there as like "be able to grab aquilquintessence?"

Great answer! Dr Disrespect was 1993 1994 back-to-back Blockbuster champ lol
---
Machines can definitely handle 13,000 skeleton entities better than compared to back then , I really hope they aren’t capping it for “performance”
---
Level to 60, lead my guild through attunement and start clearing mc/onyxia.
---
It'll be a logistical nightmare, I'll meet a lot of people and it'll be glorious. I can't wait.
---
I plan on not taking Warcraft serious enough to worry about the phases
---
Howdy! My name is Amenra and I was a mage. I started in Discipline, then moved to Elysiun until it broke up and I was the mage lead at the time, then Axis of the Revolution until Obs joined the server, then Obsidium where we cleared through AQ40 and up to KT in Naxx. Obs broke up at the end of vanilla and we formed Stack and Die with TheCore.   
---
Definitely going to be playing Classic. I've got at least six IRL friends coming back that were on Nath.
---
Just take 2 tanks and 2-3 healers and go slow if you have greens.
---
Why would anybody need this..
---
I was on swiftys server in live for a while, it was fucking obnoxious. So many people slobbering on that dudes knob
---
Help yourself &gt; help the others. If you can combine it, go for it.
---
This is so awesome! Thanks for putting in all the work, this will be super useful!
---
yup
---
They won't be afaik
---
 I can't wait for this It Feels So Far Away.. I want to play other games but cant. Want to save myself like a tight little virgin poppin her cherry.. cept I'm a dude oooooo the excitement
---
Damn. The Alliance caught him.
---
If you're going to suddenly start phrasing it as burnout being one of many reasons why people quit, then do so from the get-go. You seemed to imply that the reason why older players quit the current retail product was SOLELY due to burnout, and sort of handwaved the idea of the product just not being up to par with older expansions.
---
Most of my guild, friends and myself included have all stopped playing for the first time since the Vanilla Beta, solely due to the fact that the current iteration of WoW is so incredibly unrewarding and just not fun.
---
That and they also effectively broke the one thing that was a constant throughout the years, which is gearing.
---
I can remember every single piece of gear I had on my paladin in TBC, yet I have 11 or so lvl 120's and I can't name a single piece of gear on any of them, because most of them just randomly titanforged off of a shitty worldquest that took me 20 seconds to do.
---
I don't disagree that people can quit from burnout, but I'd wager a lot of money that people are simply disatisfied with the product, especially seeing the traction that Classic has gotten.
---
Hunters running around with Aspect of the Pack/Cheetah not realizing they perma-daze their whole group.
---
&gt; but I can see dynamic spawns being a thing to leave out.
---
when you see what 2x4s do on retail it's better left out for sure
---
Or just LFM in the servers discord and have them come to you.
---
Hey man dont be scared of phase 1 raiding, id get in and do it if you can, you dont wanna miss out on any of the vanilla content, you dont need to even dedicate much time to down MC and Ony
---
Buying key pieces of gear if something falls too far behind will actually save you time (and therefore money) in the long run. Don't be that guy that hits 40 with a WW axe and some level 25 greens.
---
Oh the thing that layering kills
---
&gt;  ive wasted 5 hours still dancing in goldshire
---
you sloot
---
who gives a shit about it though
---
Hell yeah. Getting inside BFD in Ashenvale is always an adventure in itself as there is usually another group of the opposing faction going in.
---
I'll miss farming for things to make me look fly.
---
I'm not much of a raider anymore, so when I had time to spare farming new transmog stuff was kind of my thing. Now I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the endgame anymore...
---
I'm personally going UD, simply because I can't imagine my character being anything other than undead. They have by far the best caster animations in the game.  
---
Besides, being an UD is just baptism by fire, forces you to get real good against rogues.
---
Or 2 weeks. Depends if you're looking at it glass half full or half empty.
---
Proving you can die 1000 times with no consequences helps with immersion?
---
I’d either go dwarf Paladin or dwarf hunter.
---
Going with a normal raid healing specc is not going to stop you from doing what you describe. Having more damage will make you kill things faster at the cost of loosing a bit of sustainability that the increased healing a raid specc would give, only shadow priest will be strong enough to do quests that you can’t do in a raid healing specc. 
---
Your most consistent gold farming phase 1 solo will most likely be princess in mara, you can do that in any specc as a priest.
---
Mount at 60 is 400-600g for warlocks. Can't remember exactly how much but there is also a really long quest chain to get it. Just so people don't think Paladins and Warlocks actually get a free epic mount.
---
I always do whatever my team needs.  I don’t mind filling the role.
---
Is this US or EU?
---
Probably gunna dish out 100$  or more for some G, cause i aint got time to play lol..alrdy rolling mage to skip on time walking there and there.

---
Internet pedantry is fun. We all suffer from burnout, it's how the human brain works
---
Only realism is immersive to you? What?
---
&gt;everyone was so much more helpful in classic
---
Yeah I 100% remember this being a thing
---
No, it's fine.
---
My two cents are that the paladin should really consider going warrior or rogue and one of your cloth wearers should at least strongly consider going with a leather or mail wearing class, but you will be totally fine with everyone doing exactly what they want. You will get through what ever. 
---
Have your paladin friend watch some YouTube about raiding as a paladin. My friend did it and did not enjoy it because of the pretty specific role most paladins get forced into come raiding time. 
---
As far as the two warlocks they will be totally ok, but with three cloth uses and two plate users you guys are going to find it takes a long time to get everyone gear and their will be three way and two way roll offs for everything your group can use and a bunch of great loot none of you are going to be able to use. If nobody changes class make sure one of you is an enchanter so you can funnel the useless stuff to them for sharding. 
---
The better solution for maximizing fun I think is to have one person in the four different types of armor and let the healer overlap, whether priest, Druid, or paladin, because they will get the healing gear anyway. But that’s just me, if I was the second unsure warlock I would think hard about all the benefits of being a rouge or hunter and if I was the paladin I would think hard about going rouge or second warrior.

Back then everyone used the server exclusive forums to post events and drama. If your name got posted as a ninja say bye bye to finding 5 man groups in under an hour if at all.
---
I have a fairly large group of real life friends and family members that have been playing MMO’s together since EQ.  We all learned a long time ago that everybody levels at their own rate and it’s a pointless effort trying to keep everybody at the same level.  We all just end up leveling at our own rates and then playing together at max level.  Of course we’re willing to help each other out whenever we can with group / class quests or things like that.
---
yea man, planning a full month of work arround the house so when the time comes and my last week vacation, boom, No life. atleast untill i wife aggro
---
&gt; There it is again, people always jump to calling others sociopaths or some sort of other psychopathy when they can’t comprehend other’s viewpoints.
---
That is going to happen when your "viewpoint" is that hurting other people is fine. Just as you will get called a "feminist" if your viewpoint is that women experience systemic disadvantages, or a "birdwatcher" if your viewpoint is that the best thing to do on a weekend is to go out and watch birds. Things have names.
---
&gt; Maybe not, they did it because they could, because any big event in a pvp game announced to the world will be crashed by a bunch of evildoers. It’s as simple as that.
---
What does that have to do with anything? Something is not moral just because people will do it.
---
&gt; “Morally normal people”, lmao gimme a break. I can see you suffer from the illusion of moral superiority. 
---
I have a very low baseline here. I am not saying you have to martyr yourself for a noble cause or give away your last penny to charity. Just that you not see people in emotional pain and think "fuck yes this is a great opportunity to cause them even more emotional pain!". Just don't be a sadistic fuckwit. That's all. It's not a high bar to get over.
---
&gt; Like I said, as far as I know, that’s what people have said that based on the video and old forum comments, she loved pvp. 
---
You keep repeating this mantra as if it is a total moral blank cheque. You don't get it, do you? Just because a person allegedly loved X does not license you to show up uninvited at their memorial service and shove X in people's faces.
---
&gt; Maybe that’s true but obviously they remember the human because they weren’t disrespectful with words.
---
No. Obviously they knew that this was the most hurtful thing they could do to other human beings because they made the effort to do it, to take a video of their actions, to edit it together and to publish it. They were well aware of what they were doing.
---
If this was just routine, normal PvP to them they would not have made such a big deal about it.
---
&gt; You wouldn’t see people do this in real life because people empathize, sympathize, are compassionate. They played the game but weren’t disrespectfully mocking her death or some shit.
---
You can't sugar-coat this. There is no way to "politely" disrupt and shut down a memorial service for a person who is really dead. There might be a very slight difference in the degree of arseholery involved, but only very slight.
---
Idk about prot pally tanking... The kit just isn't there, it takes way too much extra stuff to be effective. I love druid tanks though. I'm also excited to take enhance shamans in my raid team, their utility is really cool and the whole totem twisting thing seems like really fun and engaging gameplay.

u got 1.5s to move ur mouse between spells and classic has far less spells you need to aim with mouse
---
Issue is /follow is disabled in BGs.  Not sure what the fix will be, but I’m sure there will be some kind of workaround.  
---
Going to run 5 boomkins....gonna be so much fun.
---
Well my dick don't work as well as it used to unfortunately.
---
i got nothing planned besides knowing ill play mage to save some time walking there and there and easy gold farm at 55-60 and perhaps aoe lvling.    
---
   
---
How can you plan for classic though..knowing that for melees its gunna be SOOO different from all vanilla servers. glancing blows and shit is so different.
---
No wonder people think warriors are so hard to level, they don't realize they learn more skills!
---
spam
---
New players will be welcomed. Leveling is a lot slower in classic so you'll have plenty of time to learn. Best part is that since people ACTUALLY TALK to each other your party members and guildies will get to know you and teach you if you ask them.
---
So right click to move your camera? Do you still use W to move forward or double click and hold mouse? I think that works too but I want my mouse free for targeting tho.
---
Not looking forward to level 30-45. Once you get over that hump the quests and zones pick back up but man hose mid levels are painful. Also farming gold endlessly for raid consumables.
---
I remember back in vanilla for wailing caverns almost everyone would pass on looting the grey item snake tongues or something. The were worth like 20 silver a stack. So I was all about em
---
They do every year and they have a discord, I ran the last couple.
---
Hahaha I was just joking but that's pretty funny
---
All you had to say was LFR.
---
Yeah the pservers are toxic as fuck. I wouldn't judge the wow community on them. They are unmoderated so you get a ton of 12 year olds who think being racist is edgy.
---
In reality most classic players are going to be in their 30s or 40s and playing for nostalgia, and it will be a moderated world so if you're openly racist you'll get a ban.
---
There will be toxicity, Gamers gonna rise up and red pill, but it won't be nearly as bad as the private servers.
---
Is there something like this for rogues ?
---
Not sure if trolling.
---
Our? Does your gf play? If so that’s awesome. Trying to get my wife into it but then I would ruin both of our lives lol
---
If I remember correctly undead had green blood.
---
\[NA PVP Horde\] LF qt healer GF, shaman a bonus. Any healing class will be considered

As we approach launch, I wanted to do a refresh of our previous [Census and Demographics Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/), where we received over [25,000 responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIw7HPEpe5fUSV0mIVzgkdtGxHxqYc4mcVtn26ThS68/edit?usp=sharing).
---
This time around, we've added a couple more questions (and fixed some typos). Just as before, I will post the raw data results after a couple weeks so users can get a more indepth view of things like class distribution for each race. 
---
Lastly, our [Four-Day Chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ci3bhs/fourday_chat_6_rantrage_thread_read_the_op/) is going to be put on  brief hold to give the survey some time to shine while stickied. Though we'll kick it back up soon; we have several more discussions lined up before launch!
---
Cheers!
---
Come to our discord and chat at us, the raid times are still a work in progress
---
Why does so many people shit talk pserver players? They are not any more toxic than retail players or anyone else on the internet for that matter.
---
Hey, was kind of referencing r/antiMLM subreddit. Apparently you're not the only one who did get it. And I'm not as funny as I thought I was....
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/7sgtsq/your_complete_guide_to_becoming_a_mlm_bossbabe/
---
&gt;In retail client, the camera zoom slider already goes out to the maximum zoom amount.
---
Not true, at least as late as the most recent stress test. I was able to increase the zoom factor beyond the maximum slider amount via script.
---
In my experience putting a group together takes so much effort you rarely want to boot anyone.  Few people are truly too incompetent to gut it out in a 5man.  Some people might make the "never again" list but generally you just run the dungeon and pray they don't wipe you.
---
Where ever you find people, expect toxicity in some form.  
---
I'll help anyone who asks for help.
---
Dynamic spawns are fine if implemented properly. Private servers never did this. On nost when population went above X they would just apply a flat increase on all mobs in the entire world. So if there are 2000 people in elywyn forest your mobs in Kilgore are gonna spawn behind you. But if properly implemented it would be based on zone. So if there are 2000 people in Elwyn the mobs respawn quick but if there are only 20 people in mulgore everything works as normal. Coding this kind of thing can be tricky and that's why pservers opted for the easy route. Blizzard is a billion dollar company. It's totally feasible for them to do they just don't want to do it bc laziness/money. It's really disappointing.
---
Yes I have, it would be so cool! Thanks!
---
Am I the only one seeing the Barrens in Green text? Ya blew it...
---
Is "NA" the sound a Blizzard employee makes when they think about reading the NA forums?
---
Is nobody concerned about that dating format?
---
40-49 is not the best window for fairing at 60 though
---
Omg those troll answers to the question in chat &lt;3
---
Heck off, newbie!
---
JK, welcome and I hope you enjoy the game! If you ever find yourself grouping with me I would be happy to help you out and explain any mechanics or questions you may have!
---
According to my sources bfa players absolutely god awful to anyone that doesn't know every dungeon like the back of their hand.  Easier to kick the newb and let the que fill their spot.
---
Heavily swayed by pvp, thus the discrepancy for the horde's superior racials.
---
It takes a long time to put together a dungeon group and actually travel there, so people will be reluctant to kick someone.  
---
I think if you're willing to learn the ropes and tricks, I'd wager the majority will be very understand and willing to help.
---
2005-01-20 - A very confusing date format for an American.
---
Glad you can benefit from it!
---
No problem!
---
DR is on a curve Time to Live scales linearly with armor. Thus each point of armor is equally effective at making you not die.
---
No, auto loot is confirmed in Classic.  
---
Not AoE loot
---
Weird...i had that option during the test
---
This comment gave me so many feels
---
Haha same man. My first kiddo is due 2 days before release. Every nap I’ll be grinding.
---
At least you got a response from people, even if it was occasionally snarky. Now it's silence and anonymity, even when you try to be friendly and talkative to randoms in any given situation.
---
Yeah but that is part of why people want classic. No cross-realm play, your reputation matters, etc.
---
There is no LFG in classic. You aren't going to kick someone just because they didn't realize some detail, and therefore spend 40 mins finding a replacement.
---
They're way more toxic, and right wingers too.
---
Just don't pull before the tank...
---
can you elaborate?
---
For me the difference is that the elitism that existed in vanilla was frequently based on first or second hand theory crafting.  The elitism now is based on reading the "answers" on a website and then regurgitating them as an authority.
---
DRM?
---
The top script command doesn’t work either, camera distance is a slider in the UI options.
---
I think every tank in classic should have a key binding or macro to quickly set a skull mark. This way you can very quickly mark a new target after the primary one dies and you're also able to react to stuff like adds.
---
In my experience the majority of DPS players will be too lazy to always target the tanks target but most should be able to focus a marked target.
---
Thinking about 5 box myself. What do you see your composition being?
---
broken and shit?  I agree.
---
Be a warlock : )
---
[removed]
---
Are you sure you're not thinking of auto loot? It had a toggle for auto loot (you could shift click back in Vanilla IIRC) but not AoE loot...which makes sense as AoE loot was a much later addition.
---
I agree too, melee is bullshit in vanilla, but that's literally the game we want.
---
&gt; Them why the hell are you commenting?...oh just to be an asshat.
---
Me pointing out where he's wrong isn't being an asshat.  You calling names however, is.
---
 
---
&gt; &gt; t means things in world, the resources, are finite and tangible.
---
I've already explained why he is wrong here.  Resource are not finite.  They are infinite.  You can farm as many as you want to sit around for.  Forever.  There is nothing stopping you from walking in a loop and getting as many free ore nodes as you want.  That's Vanilla.
---
&gt; &gt; Mining nodes are not instanced. Chests and loot are not instanced or personal.
---
There are both nodes and chests in instanced.  I misunderstood his intended use of the word, and we've cleared that up.  He meant if we both walk up to a node, we both get ore from it.  Again already covered in previous replies:  the last retail I played didn't work that way.  It worked as it does in Vanilla.
---
I'm sorry it's so hard for you to follow a conversation.  Maybe Reddit isn't the place for you.
---
As main tank who wants to pvp maybe itll allow other players who want to tank if i swap to arms
---
Oh I agree. I actually like the idea of 1.12 talents etc in 1.1 content. It really freshens vanilla up. Makes it a whole new experience. Which is almost more blizzlike than making it the exact same.
---
Thinking someone who can't immediately get the difference is autistic is a social faux pas that someone with autism would make.
---
You just played yourself.
---
Cool, thanks for the info!
---
Bloodvine is BIS until Naxx for Warlocks if you have tailoring bonus as far as I know
---
FWIW, https://classicdb.ch/?spell=8122 shows a dispel type of 'n/a', whereas https://classicdb.ch/?spell=5782 shows 'Magic'. OTOH it also claims PS has no cooldown, so not sure what to believe.
---
I have heard other people say it's undispellable though.
---
I want a real close tight nit guild.  Still trying to figure out how to root out the cliches that form
---
Phase2 is plenty of killing lowbies near fp's, after that it bg spam. Honestly it's a good compromise
---
A shadow if its' former self
---
Ka-me-ha-me-aww
---
Goddamn that’s funny.
---
Wanna know why people adopt this mentality? When I first started playing pservers I was like you. I didn't care about using consumables in MC. Who cares if there's a ret in the raid the content is piss easy! But then you spend 4 hours clearing molten core because your hunter is an idiot who lets their pet pull extra trash. And then half your healers go afk so you need to wait 5 mins to pull the boss. And then one of your tanks quit because IRL and you need to recruit a new one and gear them out all over again. And then you need to wait 20 seconds before dpsing because your tank is in crap gear. And then you have to deal with constantly summoning people bc their too lazy to walk or do anything for themselves. And then you finally get to BWL and you struggle like crazy because there are 5 people in your raid that for some reason can't comprehend how to do easy fights. And you struggle and put up with all this BS from bad players until AQ comes out and suddenly you find that between 4 hour MC/BWLs your guild doesn't have enough time in the week to clear farm + new content. You can't skip MC/BWL because there are still lots of good upgrades in there and you can't farm AQ because you wipe endlessly to the bosses. And you finally get fed up and snap and join a tryhard guild and suddenly all these issues disappear and you quickly and efficiently clear the content in a reasonable time.
---
Humans are flawed. If you give them an inch they will take a mile. If you let them get away without using consumes they will try and get away with more stupid shit. This is why pserver guilds are so strict and autistic at times because they've been burned by bad players ruining their experience.
---
Not sure if this was meant to be a pun or an honest answer.
---
you are correct. At some point (in Wrath or BC) it was given a 3 second Internal cooldown. It was still always % chance and not PPM
---
4 wont matter till AQ40
---
People inflate the dps mages bring to the table, because people look at the top mages, and ignore the others.  But playing a mage is a group effort.    The only really fair way to do measure mage dps is to just take an average.  
---
Melee dps DOMINATE casters by a HUGE margin already.   If this change goes through, it will be even worse.
---
You put WSG in phase 6, when I think it should be in 2.
---
You can access most all the mountains surrounding the barrens pretty easy. There's even copper veins hiding in some interesting spots iirc
---
Not gonna disagree with anything you said except warrior being painful to lvl. I leveled 2 to 60 back in vanilla and it wasn’t any more painful than vanilla leveling in general.
---
I like this better, getting “raid ready” entails so much stuff, it’s nice to have a breakdown.
---
when I log on to retail I am literally playing a single player game
---
Stratholmes side entrance key came from the undead side of Stratholme
---
Oh goodness, LOL surprised no one caught that!
---
Raptor heaven 😂
---
I 2manned shadow hunter as 2 hemo rogues and 100% the pserver has the boss overtuned to shit. Can also 3man the quartermaster with a druid helping out. Pretty efficient
---
I thought it was a 1.12 thing, but at any rate if you wanted a bag in 2005 you were paying for that shit booboo.

---
The only things you should be clicking is buffs, professions and some other really niche spells like portals, demon summons etc. 
---
Everything else goes on the castbar and you have to train yourself to not click them. Even if it feels more natural to click them, force yourself to use the hotkey. This is true for any game btw.
---
Hardiness is the best racial in the game.
---
I wonder how different the end statistics would be between the two surveys. I imagine the actual Beta testing, seeing how things will actually work in Classic compared to P-servers/how people remembered things, will have some influence (I imagine significant) to people's class/role choices.
---
Better not fucking be. We need all the new players we can get if we want blizzard to create a more permanent solution
---
Sorry to say you wont be gaming much at all.
---
I actually like it. It's part of an overarching design which forces players into the open world in order to meet the gold cost to play the game.
---
Yeh what I meant was it was perfect in the way it became an afterthought. They made every item good so no item was special. They could take loot out of the game completely and no one would notice if they just changed ilvl to power level and gave you ways to increase that arbitrarily.
---
cannot believe how much it do be like this
---
They have nothing to prove...
---
At least nothing that can be proven by anything except the game itself.
---
Play it, or don't.
---
That was a really weird D.A.R.E. presentation
---
People that are toxic will encounter people who played like 15 years ago and are now too old to be toxic.
---
Those toxic people will learn that toxicity isn't going to get them places and eventually, over a slow and long level process, they will chill out.
---
Hopefully.
---
5 mans are easy tho and everything is tauntable. Aggro is hardly a factor in 5 man content.
---
Because it's a time investment to find a group some people also get annoyed when things don't work out.
---
Being toxic is also teaching people what to do, just not the most polite way, when someone says "You fucking idiot don't do X", it means you should do X.
---
Yea, small bags weren't rare at all. Me and my friends used to make a race to see who'd fill all bag slots first and the race would often be over by the time we left the starting zone.
---
This happens every year with thousands of people.
---
There is only Horde for me.  I just can’t force myself to do otherwise. Fortunately my brother agrees, or I’d have to kill him.
---
I would agree with most things staying the same, but the world buff stacking has to change.   It only wasn't removed in Vanilla, because it wasn't abused.
---
That’s what I meant by perfect, in comparison to vanilla loot. No item matters because all items give what you need.
---
In vanilla it wasn’t perfectly itemized and good items were far and few between.
---
Me saying it is perfect in retail doesn’t mean it’s good, it means that it’s pointless.
---
He’s lying to sound “cool”
---
No raiding in phase 1? thankfully phase 2 is full of solid raids, not like those boring phase 1 raids.
---
Hilarious...
---
Shit, that’s deep.
---
Best advice I can give is to not let people walk all over you. If your raiders realize they can get away with murder they will. You need to put your foot down and keep people in line otherwise people get too comfortable and begin to slack. Strong organized leadership is the most important aspect of a guild.
---
:)
---
Well it’s all homogenized and the reason I use the word perfect is that very example. It conforms to whatever your spec is. 
---
Ultimately that just means that gear is just a side effect, itemization is so good that all that matters is item level.
---
I don’t use the word perfect to make it seem like it’s good, I just mean perfect to the point you don’t even think about it, and that is bad.
---
How can you confirm Mr. Buttplug?
---
I've stayed subbed since I started in late vanilla and I haven't been truly ganked and camped in over a decade. It used to happen all the time. My brother and I leveled rogues just to gank levelers at Illidari Stand and had fun there for a couple weeks in legion but the modern game just doesn't let you totally shut someone down with bg, arena queues all over the world, tons of toys that do all sorts of crazy shit, instant teleports with deepholm potions, and that's not even including phasing, warmode, and flying. Can't wait to camp the shit out of people in classic.
---
So, uh, What happens when you get to 100% haste.
---
This isn't some theoretical cap - MCP (50%) + low health berserking (30%) + kiss of the spider (20%) is a way to do it without resorting to anything fancy, and there are many other ways (enchants, warchief's blessing, etc)
---
By the old formula, we just double our attack speed.  With the new one, we break the game (attacking as fast as the server will let us?)
---
A horde DPS feral druid can even get close enough to see weird effects without doing anything non-standard.  MCP (50%) +Warchief's Blessing (15%) +iron counterweight (3%) is enough to more than triple the attack speed, and should get people's attention
---
The damage to health pools ratio gets completely bonkers at naxx gear levels and it goes from fun and fast paced to one shots. Most people agree BWL patch is the most fun and balanced.
---
Is there a specific Horde version of this?   
---
Anyone know who the creator is? They might be able to just turn off the alliance/horde stuff
---
grind the lower level rock elementals in badlands, sell the vendor trash stone. can net 50s or so for a stack of 5.
---
Are you me?
---
Blizzard eventually making dumb decisions that'll make people regret it in the future.
---
This is the question that needed to be asked.
---
The retail wow pug scene and the private server scene are both pretty toxic. Classic will be combining these two groups, streamer fanboys, and older yet for some reason aggressive “I’ve got a wife and kids!” crowd.
---
Then add in the meme spec proliferation which has people either angry or defensive before the game even launches. 
---
Top this off with an extremely high population of folks all competing for the same mobs, trying to get 60, with unchecked faction based pvp in an era where everyone knows everything.
---
If you’re new just be prepared to use the ignore function.
---
All I'm gonna say to you guys is that this is, 100%, a live mindset. Tank pulling is excruciating in vanilla, especially with warrior tanks (druids are a bit better). They just don't have the kit for it. Their ranged control in PvE is really bad; basically their only tool is raw LOS and they have a very limited ability to split pulls, etc. You're *much* better off finding a good mage or hunter that knows how to smoothly feed the tank one mob at a time.
---
You’re not wrong man. I also can’t wait and that’s why I got drunk and posted this cringefest.
---
Hellscream memorial in ashenvale. F’s in the comments boys

Yeah should be the full bingo ;)
---
Hard to pick just 3 things I’m most excited for!
---
Swifty doesnt need that many buttons
---
Looking for a west coast Horde guild on a PvP server that will raid Monday, Tuesday, and/or Thursday nights (and I would be available some weekends as well though I only spend about 50% of my weekends at home).
---
I'm intending to play a 1/29/21 or 30/21 druid with emphasis on bear talents in the feral tree so that I can tank/heal level 60 dungeons and heal/offtank as needed in raids.  I'm psyched to be a little more versatile than I was as a Priest healbot in my former WoW days.
---
I played Vanilla WoW from Day 1 and progression raided everything from Ony, MC, and through C'thun as a Priest in a competitive guild.  I stepped into Naxx a few times, but quit the game shortly after its release as when Naxx dropped in summer of '06 I was a few weeks from heading off to college.  I figured I only had time for 3 of the 4 (sleep, school, social life, WoW) and chose to drop WoW.
---
I conveniently have the entire week after Classic's release off work so I plan to level hard for the first week or so and then taper off my playtime a bit to evenings and convenient weekends.
---
Except then the speedruns turn into multiple raid runs.  Why waste time trying to clear MC in an hour when you can do 2 runs?
---
That’s exactly what I meant by perfect itemization. Just because it’s perfect doesn’t mean it’s good.
---
Don’t you have to stay rank 14 to use the weapons anyways?
---
im sure they are the type of person to take everything a person says literally and has no knowledge of sarcasm, exaggeration or any nuance of the english language
---
If anyone else is curious https://youtu.be/Ecyrt5NKHg8
---
are you dumb?
---
Yeh that’s what I mean by perfection, every item has what you need so it’s just an afterthought, wonky items mean critical thinking.
---
No doubt, but we aren’t playing tbc, we are playing vanilla.
---
I think hunters and druids specificlly get the "hard to master" tag because of all the little small things you can do accompanied by tons of micromanagent I.E. shapeshifting, pet control. Trap placement, etc. Etc. I don't think any class is easy to master but hunter, druid, and warlock. Are absoultely among the hardest
---
This will most likely happen considering how it’s going far
---
There's not much but if I was a rogue is vanish and let them do it until it's changed lol
---
Wouldn't mind seeing it myself.
---
Players have given evidence on large issues with the beta using data &amp; vanilla videos which get ignored and responded to with a  "We confirmed this on the reference client" which you cannot refute at all &amp; atleast once they've been asked to give numbers/proof with their reference client and have said no.... 
---
Oh well, people either play the game as it will be in a month, play on an extremely low pop private server or play another game
---
So therefore ranged should do more damage? Yes threat is the defining mechanic for dps but the fact that you are at a distance gives the tank (or off tank) a chance to regain aggro, and the "it's worse for the raid" has nothing to do with properly balancing the game.
---
Barrens chat hype let’s goooooo
---
Hell yeah, Barren's Chat!
---
Let's assume you respec twice a week. Once before raid, and once after raid. 100 gold per week x 4=400g per month. 400g x 2 years (24 months the average lifespan of a vanilla server) = 9600g in respecs over the lifetime of a server. The best farm methods make approx. 50g per hour. 9600 / 50 = 192 hours of farming gold. World record level speeds clock in at about 5 days /played or 120 hours. So yea if you planned on consistently respeccing throughout your entire time playing it would theoretically be worth it to just level a second character.
---
I'd say probably Eredan or Helmer on Sentinels. Both were super cool guys and pretty good players that I was guilded with back in the day.
---
That's why I'm actually excited for this: not just because of the old content, but playing WoW and having people talk to one another. On the 400 manish private server I was n for wrath I saw more people in the world questing than I did in Warlords. I never realized just how big of a difference flying mounts made.
---
Also not having 6 flight paths in every zone is off
---
r/unexpectedletterkenny
---
I started playing in BC and that's when I remember seeing the Susan spelled out in corpses lol
---
For the short time I've played classic I can say that I cant just face roll quests, it was kind of a surprise to be honest
---
That's damn funny.  Took me a minute to remember why the name sounded familiar.
---
its likley most servers will be very unbalanced like retail servers 
---
streamers will help make this a bigger thing as they attract viewers to their faction on servers
---
I edited my comment above with the link to all the beta findings, the dw miss calculation is wrong, abilities for melee are two roll, glancing is 65% not 70% just to name a few things
---
Plenty of clothies will be leveling Tailoring and will make 6 slots for mats only.
---
I claim nothing of the kind.
---
oh easily mate, I knew exactly what it meant, I just preferred to click it was back then easier for me.  It took for me a naga to get out of doing it.
---
Perfect. thanks! I replaced the link on the hit cap explanations :)
---
Chat gives way more context as to why that troll was there
---
I did it during like senior year of HS. Didn’t have much going on then so to speak.  One positive is it kept me out of trouble
---
You know why: "Won't someone think of the children?"
---
We can't have the kids seeing blood and violence!
---
im curious. is warrior the first class you leveled?
---
back in the day i leveled a hunter and later on i leveled a druid, mage and then i started a warrior.
---
it might be that because i went "down" in percieved leveling convenience and you went "up" that the warrior doesnt seem so bad to you :). just guessing
---
I agree, kept me out of trouble too!
---
haha nah man. i was actually happy to see that the first few replies i got were people being genuinely helpful. If i had asked this on the WoW sub or any other game sub really i'd just get hostile af replies. So good on you for being a good human. Also i am actually legit choosing between druid and priest atm haha
---
I am thinking when classic drops ill make up bars that resemble my layout.  Would make it easier to keep on track.
---
I do now :P
---
"What's that? Troll hunters tamed a sick plainstrider? Oh my God guild are you hearing this?"
---
Hahaha it's not 10 parts on just RFD, each part covers it's own instance. I think the longest video I've done is like 11 minutes.
---
Cheers :D thought i'd try make it obvious with the miliseconds incase too many people took it serious and flamed me for daring to ask questions.
---
Well yeah eventually you're going to say fuck it and go solo grind or start a new group.  But nobody is going to get booted for meh dps or small mistakes.
---
But non special specs don't need to go this extra mile for a spot?
---
Or think, if a regular spec player did this and curried favour, surely they'd be a higher standing that an spriest?
---
I just mean in the first 45 minutes or so like you see here.
---
yup, I am still not 100% used to it and I click the odd spell here and there
---
Agreed! I think it’s a mix. There’s parts that won’t be as fun considering we all know how to play so well now. But I have so much less time to play I’m glad I’ll be able to do instances and so forth much quicker as a whole.
---
I know. It was just something I was working on when the post popped up.
---
Wait, paladin has gotta be considered faster than warr/rogue. Especially on fresh. Don't you think? 
---
I mean level 40 mount easy and also that combat sustain and solid dps while fighting undeads through out the game. Kill speed to my mind seems to about the same across all three on average, maybe I'm imagning it wrong.
---
The axes from wotlk were BA too
---
Is there a sub for old WoW screenshots? If so, someone link em it because I love this stuff.
---
Ask questions if you don't know something.  People might get annoyed if you fuck something up because you were too proud to ask a question.  Virtually nobody is going to mind explaining a mechanic if it prevents a wipe.
---
so true and as a hunter I was always on a cool down of some description
---
he probably had one of the coolest names. On Jubei'thos there was a Prot Warrior (MT) named Guilty in my guild Dark Sun. He also was the Guild GM, not sure really the details of the story as i wasn't in the raid when it happened but there was a story where he ninja looted  Ashjre'thul (BWL Crossbow, pretty powerful). 
---
Became pretty famous on the server for that story, also was pretty much blacklisted, can't remember what happened after that, may have moved to a different server all together. 
---
Guild was pretty sad though, after collecting enough DKP to purchase my bloodfang shoulders, i was gkicked by the class officer before he distributed the shoulders that i was suppose to get. Not sure why or for what? instead they went to the class officer's ALT!
---
Facts. People will typically be patient and guide you through a dungeon but if you are just a hot mess and keep wiping the group after several explanations and attempts expect some backlash and some hearths.
---
This Census survey is a fantastic idea! Well done! :)
---
This just gave me WoW fever!
---
 Lmfao how do you Negative Nancy's even get out of bed in the morning?
---
Not the early one where npcs were stronger
---
I like how he just saves his safe distance
---
Nah, I leveled a shaman first. Of course I wasn’t very good but I did it. 
---
Mained a shaman for my raiding career and just pvp’d warriors.
---
^ this. So much this.
---
The real question is do you want a jack of all trades that can level easy that is mostly ok end game, or a pure healer that does their thing really well, but can be kind of a chore to level if you don't spend points in the shadow tree?
---
Also the Ginsui swords from Uldaman random drop, managed to get a pair on my 36 rogue 👍
---
Rogue can vanish to reset threat tho. Literally have it better then every other class lol.
---
Lmfao, we all did it when we were 14 and got a hold of mommy's credit card.
---
I wanted to level up while at school, sue me.
---
That actually is a pretty good idea. I felt like I died a lot while leveling but that may just be due to the pain that was the corpse runs.
---
My fav part of this is the guy in general chat recommending thottbot.com
---
&gt; Love feralas for some reason.
---
Make sure to tell all your friends about jumping off the Twin Colossals. Whether you tell them that the parachute doesn't last for the entire fall is another story.
---
For me, my favorite and most memorable landmark has to be the pass between Dustwallow Marsh and Barrens where the burnt remains of the Shady Rest Inn lie.
---
Let me give context.
---
How do you get to Theramore Isle? You take the ship fromMenethil Harbor in the Wetlands. So by the time you're traveling through Dustwallow, you've already obtained a frame of reference for what a swamp environment looks like from having been in the Wetlands beforehand. Albeit Dustwallow has a far more eerie feeling than the Wetlands.
---
But where's your frame of reference for a large arid landscape with foreign flora and fauna? A totally alien environment and nothing the likes of which you nor your character had ever experienced before.
---
When you step foot onto the divide between moisture saturated marshland and dry, cracked earth, seeing a burnt Human building to your left, you look around further and see the blinding sunlight and feel the scorching heat from the Barrens.
---
You feel, yourself, alien; Being somewhere you shouldn't be. You feel in danger, but overwhelmingly intrigued, yet threatened by the very land itself.
---
The quest that took me to the Barrens was one for Alliance Warlocks. Don't look it up if you want to find out on your own. But when I looked it up just now, I definitely remembered the name of the quest and it honestly gave me goosebumps.
---
Thanks for making this thread. What an awesome memory.
---
No
---
Just be a dad dude. It’s way more fun than WoW. Your little one is like your main toon. Gear them up and follow them in 3rd person while they explore the world for the first time.
---
I just answered that. DR is on a curve (Diminishing returns). But the your effective time to live is still linear.

MY FAVORITE PART OF THIS COMMENT IS THE RETAIL TOURISTS PREDICTABLY WORMING UP OUT OF THE MUCK TO CONTEST IT
---
&gt;Mana gems orange  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;No alternative damage for frost immune enemies  
---
&gt;Frost ward is good but fire ward orange for some inexplicable reason
---
I don't recommend any new mage follow this at all.
---
Ignore them.  There's no productive reason to either group or associate with a player who is actively trying to deny joy and the experience of the game.  There are far more supportive and old school players who are willing to help, or help explain LFG channel, how bags work, how mounts work, etc.
---
According to the change log  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccu57o/classic\_changelog/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccu57o/classic_changelog/) 
---
blood effects where added again on a low setting, implying you can increase the setting via known command.
---
I have very little time to play and, thus, very little patience.  While playing some private servers I wound up grouped with some really piss-poor players in Deadmines.
---
A rogue rolled on the 6 spirit 2 int ring and won it, a warlock wiped us twice, and numerous others recklessly aggroed huge groups which I had to scramble to keep under control (I was tanking).
---
It was really frustrating, but just being in the dungeon was exciting enough for me to reel it in and attempt to give constructive feedback.
---
Some were receptive and really picked up on some nuances, and others were cantankerous little shits who resumed poor and risky play (that was the second time the lock wiped us).  
---
Even when I decided I didnt want to continue grouping with the person I thought it would be worth it to explain why and try to give a purposeful reason.  He was defiant and rude, but I like to think my not being mean meant he could eventually take something forward (even if it wasnt with me in the party).
---
If you're not a jerk about giving feedback, I find that the people who listened and wanted to adjust to difficult (relatively speaking) content and tighter group play made it very much worth the patience.
---
There will be good players who are nice, and some who are dicks.  There will be bad players who are dicks, and some who are really awesome people.  I quickly learned not to assume someone is one type or the other just because of how they play out the gate.  
---
That's the real reason I'm excited to play classic: to get in the ring with all different types of people and to build a nice long friend list full of great people - even if they're not the most competent players from the start.
---
True. Kinda both haha. I like the idea of druid as it seems fun but also wana be real good at healing. Maybe i'll alt a druid for fun when i need a break from my main
---
If it's additive, then you are dong infinite damage, but if it's multiplicative, then that's less of a problem.  
---
1\*(1-0.5)\*(1-0.5) = 0.25 
---
Still insanely good though, 
---
1/(1.5\*1.5) = 0.4444
---
More like dumbfounded by people like you, but tell yourself whatever lets you sleep at night.
---
who cares about semantics its obviously whats being discussed
---
Nochangers reeeing in the distance
---
Sell countless amounts of gold and accounts to people with more money than time
---
i see you looking at the bottom and clicking downvoted people go you
---
I mean druids aren't bad they just don't have as good direct heals as priests when both are in pure healing specs.  In 5 mans this is fine because you get some decent heal over time spells, but in raids those heal over times don't stack with the other druids' so unless you have the most spell power you just have to rely on your decent, but not as good as priests' heals.
---
I wasn't blacklisted but most of the server had me on ignore because I annoyed them personally.
---
My Naga faithfully carried me through all of my WoW career.
---
Looks like a prime doomguard target
---
But think of the children playing this T rated game
---
Doesn't really happen in classic. You can usually tell if someone is appropriate for your group based off a simple inspect to see if they're a warrior in cloth gear or something. It's not like it takes rocket science to do any 5man content so as long as you're not itemizing like an idiot you should be fine and raids will always have steeper requirements.
---
Really tho world buffs and consumables make up for more dps then any gear ever could. You get 16% spell crit completely for free if you put in the time to go get the buffs. This far outweighs any gear you can get in phase 1 and tells you if a player is dedicated or not. No logs necessary.
---
Human puny nuff said
---
Make the T rated game actually E, brilliant
---
Yes, but just because people are always toxic.
---
if the values are based on troll berserking haste then thats where youre getting confused. thats 10%-43% because the first 10% is base and the rest is is a roll from 0%-30%. So itd maxed out at Wpn speed / (1.10*1.3). So with numbers youd get 2.7 / (1.1*1.3) = 1.88. So the tldr is that troll berserking tooltip is shit and you actually get a 10% base haste and then a second roll on the next haste value
---
Why not just add that to their version only? Like all of their boneless undead bakers
---
It won’t be like it once was. 
---
Politics are too heated now, and some crybaby always gets offended by the tiniest thing and goes on a rant.
---
It's one less thing they have to change between versions .
---
Only MT. Main reason is that Baron Geddon / Ragnaros both do lots of fire damage to the tank. Baron Geddon's tank damage profile is 100% fire, so even cloth greens of fire resist are going to be better than your plate whatever. Ragnaros' melee swings are still physical, so no fire res greens, but his knockback is fire damage so whatever you can get helps.
---
Druids level as feral. Leveling with warriors, it'd be a bear tank with fury warriors as the way to go. Bears generate more threat (and more dps) than prot warriors, while fury does more dps than cats. But druids are a tough class to learn and to play, particularly healing, as druids lack a fast heal, lack an out of combat rez. Other healers get both, which help out quite a bit.
---
Your paladin friend would level as ret, but he'd be relegated to healing at level 60, maybe in the 50s, when you start doing 5 mans like Stratholme, DM, BRD, and LBRS.
---
Your priest friend would level as shadow until at least level 50, as you can definitely heal all the lower dungeons that way. Any healer could heal the lower dungeons without a healing spec, as all of them were designed around leveling specs, not end game specs, but priests have an easier time at it, due to shadow gear sharing many similar stats as healing gear.
---
As others have said, if you can convince someone to go mail or leather, that would help out a lot with gear drops.
---
Idk what server, but this mage named Grandir. Taught me the ropes for pvp, introduced me to his guild, and brought me with him on our big merger. Still in contact with this scrub to this day.
---
It's mspog. Massively single player online game.
---
Glad they changed this one:  
---
Resurrection Sickness When you are resurrected by a spell or soulstone, you revive with a condition called resurrection sickness. It lasts for a few minutes. During this time,all your character attributes are severely reduced and your maximum health and mana are much lower than normal.
---
Holy shit the politics. A guild on my server wanted some of the raiders from another guild and they wouldn't leave, so they got a couple guys to pretend to be chicks and legit made the other guild implode with stupid honeypotting bullshit.
---
The old internet was a wild place, man.
---
I get your meaning. I probably wouldn't go so far as to say it is unplayable but i do have a diminished enjoyment.
---
I am totally oblivious to it then. Sucks to be me 😂
---
Killing core hounds simultaneously was hilariously difficult for us, I'm not gonna lie.
---
Lol yeah, I remember ninjas and being blocked out of groups all the time because my class was the same as someone who wanted something or both being cloth dps. Hell, people will even leave groups if the GL doesn't know that person was going for an item and they invited you (the same class) to go.
---
You probably can pug them in classic. It'll be heavily nostolgia seekers.
---
small indie company aint got time for that
---
Pretty much.
---
Oh i think i stopped reading
---
Never looked like that to me because I didn't have a machine that could run WoW on max settings. By the time I did, they had done the first graphic update. So I never actually saw vanilla in full settings. Dude is horrifying.
---
Doesn"t it scale with current health? Not random
---
Hah on the pserver I play on, I had a mage pull in uld while the healer was getting mana. Backed off and let him get mauled by troggs.
---
In wotlk people called each other wrath babies.
---
In classic it's going to happen. Dont know what the term will be.  Maybe retailtards.

Reddit community is not a good representative of the spectrum of people who are going to play world of warcraft classic. Not sure how good this survey would be
---
Phase one is fine been there done that i just feel free n no rush to get raiding again at least not initially. The nice part about classic is i do not have to worry about content becoming to obsolete in a year or two. After raiding in retail for years now it will be nice to be in no rush before the next raid tier.
---
20% of people here took a week or more off for classic launch xD
---
I took two weeks.
---
Funny story, but if you believe this I got a bridge to sell you.
---
Just giving you my opinion on your video.
---
I miss the days when Blizzard was a good company
---
In their final notes from the beta it says the effects were added back in... looks like you're just another person who found an old video, did no research, and posted it to generate outrage and upvotes. I hope you're proud of yourself.
---
When I was getting into Starcraft my coach told me to never click my hotkeys. If I forget what key it is, hover over it with your mouse to see and then click the hotkey. Train yourself to never click a hotkeyed ability.
---
that's some high impact violence. banned in Australia.
---
Really, did they appease China but acknowledging the effect should exist and putting them as per their final notes from the beta? Did they? Hmmmmmm. Maybe stop repeating whatever redditor/streamer told you that without fact checking.
---
It proves the authenticity of the screenshot.

Because it's more fun to speedrun?

Mostly because they reversed new technology, they didnt just upgraded the old stuff. So since blood and flash isnt in bfa then its not in beta, its probably just an oversight.

Are you really that sure that its a large portion? I'd be willing to bet that 90% of people who play classic would never notice the difference.

Picking a race based on a bit of resist here or there is a valid way to play - but if you're like me and play for the worldbuilding and your head-RP, play what sounds cool to you!
---
&gt;  i pvp'ed exclusively on my demon hunter, and, for those who don't know, at that time you would get a template with pre-determined stats when you entered a battleground. the amount of stats you got depended on how high your ilvl was.
---
It blows my mind that the WoW community nowadays *likes* this change to the game. Less work to jump into PVP I guess.
---
To me it destroys the entire foundation of World of Warcraft. If I'm not increasing my power level for the sole purpose of crushing my enemies and see them driven before me, then the game has no point.
---
How does this affect the viability of feral druids who use manual crowd pummelers?  This takes their bear attack speeds from 2.5 to 1.25 (was 1.67 with the old formula), and their cat attack speeds from 1.0 to 0.5 (was 0.67 with old formula).
---
Honour buddy was the go i used to sit that thing on farm in cata and sell to one guy just sent him all the herbs for months i bet he made a killing on darkmoon cards
---
Ah yes, those deep naxx pug raids..
---
Honestly classic should feel fresh to me because of my limited time, new outlook, and the fact that i rolled alliance in classic. Ill have to check out botw though.
---
Here's what I think about balance... Life isnt balanced. 6 foot 12 year old bullies can wreck most other 12 year olds. Some people will always suck at math. There is bound to be imbalance. The more balanced something is, the more boring it is, like chess. Chess is competitive and that aspect of it can be fun, but honestly its boring as fuck. Props to the Chess champion though because it's a great achievement. Just like I praise BFA arena champions. Doesnt mean I enjoy it. Vanilla is not a balanced game. There is so many possibilities that there are multiple ways you cant outplay other players, but there is also great mismatches like hunter vs warrior. On the other hand, warriors are mostly the only viable raiding spec. 
---
All of this is not BALANCED, but its FUN god damn it!
---
Should I go buy a CRT monitor, and randomly unplug my Ethernet cable too?
---
MC and BWL will be absurdly easy with, or without addons, I for one would love to see them re balance all of the raids, but the idea that anyone is going to play without addons at this point in WoW's life is absurd.
---
I still find it hard to believe that 75% (as of this post) of the people in this sub reddit played vanilla, but I guess it's just this sub-reddit.  The majority of the people who were in my guild are now in the 35+ bracket and yet we're 10% of the people in the sub-reddit. 
---
&gt; What is the earliest retail World of Warcraft expansion you played?
---
I know the question was looking for vanilla.  But technically, Vanilla is an invalid answer.  TBC is really the only earliest answer you can give, since vanilla was not an expansion.  I also feel private server people didn't read the "retail" part on this and answered it yes to skew it.
---
It's ridiculously high. I played on a pserver a while before classic was even released just feeling a bit nostalgic for the past, and every time I'd have a full set of 6 slotters by the time I left the 1-6 mini-zone. 
---
It can happen in vanilla/classic too, but that's super rare.
---
You think you know, but you don't.
---
The main difference is pally has no way to deal with multiple mobs at once, so that hurts their kill speed a lot, and their single target damage is already lower than warrior or rogue. Pally's healing in ret gear is terrible so that's not a huge plus, unlike druids they do need to spend mana to keep up a decent kill speed so they can't spend 3 minutes regen'ing and then heal up and repeat like druids do.    
---
    
---
They can kill UD ok but there's not that many UD mobs and that just runs them out of mana even faster.  
---
  
---
Mount at 40 is nice but really anyone trying to level fast will probably be skipping skills and be within 30g or less at 40 and just borrow the rest from someone who already has their mount (or a guildie warlock/pally).
---
&gt; Get an editor.
---
You, sir, have made a fantastic start.
---
Solid plan
---
How does a fella get caught up in that sort of business?
---
cannot cuz china

Yes, the same as it’s always been. Grinding for gear or grinding for vanity crap I’d like to have.

all of these arguments fail to bring in my favorite part...

not fighting against paladins =P
---
I had 2 friends (were husband/wife at the time) that were pallys back in vanilla. They did their GM grinds and got the gear afterwards. It was so fun pvping with them as a gnome lock. When he specced into prot, it was hilarious watching him run the flag in WSG. So much survivability.

Warhammer was a WoW clone with an emphasis on PvP. It was awful anyway because they didn’t put enough effort into it and rushed the release date.

Honestly, as cool as that was, i'm okay with losing that feature if it means gold spammers won't be able to ruin my experience. It was cool and funny seeing random players' bodies in Orgrimmar, especailly when I could recognize a few names. But it was really un-immersive to constantly see gold farmer website spam a lot of the time, too.
---
&gt;Please stop lying to yourself you never quit. You cannot escape that easy.

Nah, I straight up quit TBC...

...and I unknowingly was just waiting for the good version of the game to come out again.

1 week of mining or herblore is enough also tbh. i never did DRM farming or grinding mobs for cash

I get that it's fun to be as efficient as possible when you're in game, but try not to hardcore it to the max, you'll just stress yourself out, feel anxious and probably have less fun.

Then you should be hanging around Goldshire on an PvE server.
---
'Yes the 12 "core" members will probably get gear before others, but that is due to commitment to guild and status within the guild.'
---
is a huge red flag for me, I would leave any guild I felt I was committed to if others got loot first due to nepotism (barring the main tank of course).
---
Yes brotha. Open up your battle net app. There's a little box in the bottom left that you can click that says retail wow(I believe) and another selection says classic. Click the classic of course and then begin the download! :)
---
Same, remove the aids RES please
---
Blizz wants you to play retail

They need you to play retail

But I won't.

Nope, going shaman instead of druid this time around.

I was in a RP guild on Sisters of Elune who had a no swearing rules because sometimes the guildies little tittie suckers liked to get on and RP or fart around. What ever it's their guild their rules, except I have a medical condition, I was in the NAVY (har har just a joke) and I cant not fucking swear, I have an aneurism after a few hours (I think) so anyhoo these RP guys went so far as to invent their own language so instead of "gratz" people would say "valalori!" or some nonsense. Anyways I asked how many made up words they had and this dude linked me a website with maybe 40 words and wouldnt you know it they had a substitute word for fuck and bitch, I learned how macros worked that wonderful day...
---
Then you'd be a bit late to the party if you start on the 27th.
---
I live how one of the responses is barrens chat.
---
...5 years, 10 years, you thought you were fine, that the real WoW was a thing of the past, banned into extinction. You didn’t have to worry about it anymore cause the game had changed. You couldn’t get the real stuff. Little did you realize the beast was hidden away and kept alive by cults of gamers on private servers, who nurtured it until it became simply too strong to be hidden and subverted any longer. Now your resolve will truly be put to the test.
---
That isn't even close to what the tooltip says, and frankly makes no sense whatsoever.
---
Increases your attack speed by 10% to 30%.  At full health the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking.  Lasts 10 sec.
---
Maybe, but he has skinning!
---
Quite surprising to see a third of the people filling out the survey is already committed to a guild at this point. Eager to see if it stays that way as more people get around to filling it out.
---
Well it's a dungeon grind so the hours after launch wouldn't really affect the lvling speed that much. Also it isnt really a race for us. It's mainly focused on the social aspect and reminiscing.
---
I still remember the name of the Gnome Warlock on Draka during TBC, who would always Hellfire himself to death in Shattrath before logging out. In the exact spot you'd teleport onto when porting back from Isle of Quel'Danas. Thanks for the laughs, Krispykrunch.

This isn't a small thing at all, you kill thousands of mobs playing this game. Small issue, but it's an issue with the very fabric of the game, so it's a huge issue. Sign people!

I'm worried about this happening, then their shill viewers leave with them and the server is fd.

Haha, forgot about that!

That's weird, Discord has mostly been flawless and seamless for me. I did have a period a year or two ago where it just wouldn't launch for like a month and I had to use the web version instead of the regular application, because it just wouldn't work no matter how many times I reinstalled it (Never did figure out why), but aside from that it has been a good experience. Never really heard of anyone having issues with it.
---
Oh God forgot about that happening ☠
---
You can though if you just believe in yourself.
---
Non instances dungeons were pretty hit or miss. I remember playing shaiya as a kid, and the first dungeon in the game wasn't instanced and the final boss only gave loot to one party.
---
Picture 2000 sweaty anime characters standing around a pedestal waiting for a demon or some shit to spawn so that they could kill it in .25 seconds and someone *might* get loot they'll use (or prolly just vendor it for money and reset).
---
Good tanks are hard to find. Always end up begging a fury warrior to at least try. Good luck to you! 
---
This is gonna be a blast. I'm getting more and more hyped as we get closer!
---
being able to queue and get tele'd inside dungeons.. man what were they thinking
---
"I will never understand ... " should refer to something you have tried to understand

did you know after many years of lashing and slavery from humans, orcs developed their resistance to stun.

---
I like his name :)
---
Well warrior is obviously ea because they get kited to shit and have fear breaks.  
---
Rogue could go either way, fears and roots are very hard for you to deal with. Most popular pvp builds don't take imp sprint so you only have vanish so roots will screw you over a lot. Basically both fear and roots are about equal annoyance/frequency so 1 min cd wins.    
---
Warlock I want to say ea just because you'll nearly always have felpuppy out in pvp and you're already a hard target for enemy casters, rogues/warrior are by far your biggest problem and gouge/nade -&gt; ea will help out a ton.  
---
Mage is basically the opposite of warlock in that rogue/warrior are pretty easy for you and enemy warlock and priest are the annoying ones. You have blink/poly for resets against melee that many you don't really need time to kite and very strong snares of your own.
---
I’m not aware of any, but having a quick look at the event available, you could make an extremely light addon that just registers the PARTY_LOOT_METHOD_CHANGED event and play a specific audio file and display a raid warning message. The .lua would only need to be a few lines.

In the pirated realms the powershifting interrupts their auto atks.  This should be less of an issue in classic, so this is like a double buff to them.
---
Orc prot warrior 25%+15%talent = 40% stun resist, very good for PVE
---
I look forward to all of these players rolling Orc and then finding out a year later that they are worse than Undead in premades and duel tournaments.
---
Farming key recipes, like the flasks for alchemists.
---
I played with like 20-30 addons in vanilla
---
It's one of the best parts of the game, making a UI
---
It's easier to swap out textures than it would be to have conditional behavior at runtime, like only sometimes showing a blood animation.
---
Luckily for everyone else it's usually up to the tank to coordinate the dungeon group.  They should be marking and telling people to cc.  As long as you are aware that you can't faceroll classic, most of the harder stuff comes down to the tank (holding threat/proper pulls).  So I think you will be 100% fine.
---
I only leveled leatherworking
---
Because there's no better feeling than blasting someone in 1v1.
---
\*Realistic\*
---
The horde side is annoying af! So many back and forth trips into BRS, having to find Rexxar a bunch of times, then the crazy amount of travel to kill all the dragons. Alliance just has jailbreak, which is only annoying if someone starts the quest before everyone is on the same step.
---
I would love that server!
---
Let's be honest it wasn't that hard to predict.
---
It's more of a whitelist system.  Being bad usually won't get you on anyone's radar in classic unless you are an asshole/ninja looter.  But if you are good, you will random invites to run shit.  I would always watch meters and I'd never boot anyone for being crap.
---
Vashj EU?
---
Because of the class abilities that break certain CC. Like mage blink for snares and warrior zerker rage or death wish for fears.

Who even wants to be in this guild? Are the a top guild on the server?

The minute someone starts micromanaging me over dumb shit, that's the moment I'm out.
---
Yes tanking and healing is fine as long as you have the gear for it.  If groups are your main thing, i would get consecration first so you can also get spiritual focus.  Then its up to you if you want to go down prot or ret.  I would go ret for increased movement speed and parry is strong while leveling.  If youre tanking early on, then pickup redoubt and precision before going down ret.  
---
I personally will get pursuit of justice at level 22, consecration by 33, kings by 44, and then decide if i want to get illumination or just finish the ret tree depending on the state of my gameplay.
---
Had my best moments throughout WoW with RL friends. As long as you don't start hating your friends when they loot quest items or gear upgrades before you you'll be absolutely fine.
---
just keep recasting level 1 firestorm until you get a stun! /s

They are the top guild just because all the other raids left the server. Proudmoore is labeled as a lgbtq positive server.

A bunch of people are playing with their pserver  guilds, and that’s a higher population on this sub than what the servers are going to look like.

If someone is afraid to spend $15 to try a game, then they might have bigger financial problems that should be addressed.
---
That's like asking for a free sample of a $15 Ribeye because you don't know if you'll like it. If you are more worries about the money than the possibility of not enjoying yourself, you need to reprioritize.
---
and ignore.  See how popular they get when they can't get a group because the whole server ignores them.

Some big youtuber(I forget who) made a video showing classic beta loot vs private servers showing that classic beta has a lot more gray drops and a lot less bag drops so more vendor value trash to sell which equates to less of a value in skinning.

I was in Iraq in 2004, but I managed to raid everything up to AQ40 before Navy life took me back to sea.  I got back in time for TBC and raided right through to Ulduar and TOGC before quitting.

Community will be so spread across expansions we’ll have dead servers.
---
I think anyone with a brain could tell you vanilla Hardiness is the best PvP racial the game has ever had. There's a reason why the winner of most private server duel tournaments was an Orc, and most of the time also a Warlock.
---
However, sometimes you just gotta keep it real and play from the heart. It's not enough to just kill someone, you gotta do it while looking stylish and badass. Sometimes you have to devour their corpse right in front of their face to truly send a message. A message that says: "You're done here, and you better bring backup if you want to even stand a chance next time."
---
Only one race can do that.
---
What a lot of guilds did was have a separate account to house the bank with the login shared by the officers... probably against the TOS but I never heard about it being enforced.
---
Or the GM would have the guild bank on an alt on their own account.
---
Every once in a while you'd hear about an officer stealing the bank or a guild master just quitting the game and letting the bank sit there, or using guild funds to buy their own BoEs or something.

Hardiness, which comes from Orc

Acquire useful recipes too, you get very little from the trainers. 
---
Stocking up on consumables is important too.
---
You are correct, sir. However, thats the cool thing about classic! You really dont have to hurry. I plan on making a shitton of alts. Because when i grind the gear, ill have it forever. No new patches to completely screw me over. It'll be amazing. Ill always be able to log in and play my chars :D
---
•	⁠Flying mount •	⁠End of world pvp •	⁠Dungeon finder
---
It wasn't a mistake.  Dwarves were planned to have Mage as a class selection up until the last moments of beta.  They were removed because Alliance had more options for Mage than Horde.  The manual was most likely printed prior to that change.
---
Seriously,  WTF?
---
I'm loathing that my prediction of Priest being overpopulated seems to be true with the first 1.2k responses... 2nd most played class (3rd Horde side). Curious what it will look like after 10k.-
---
Many dungeons contain pre raid bis for every class, if I rushed myself to 60 I obviously didnt grind out those dungeons for loot pre 60, spamming strat for argent dawn rep will be useful later, spamming brd for any number of rare drops your class might want, I cant think of a single dungeon at maraudon level or higher that 0 classes would be interested in grinding for loot after hitting 60.  
---
I also said I'd be seeking fun world pvp opportunities, not exclusively bgs.  
---
Advocating that people who rush 60 aren't gonna have anything to do is just absurd. Theres sooo many grinds in vanilla, rushing through the big 1-60 grind isnt gonna ruin the game for anybody.
---
Maybe removed as a siezure trigger, though i doubt it given all the other flashes in the game

On Beta servers, the Chinese character names are created on Chinese language based client.  
---
When Classic WOW comes to live,  things will changed and it will look just the same as now on retail.
---
&gt; I would guess most of the work would go into the how and when of stacking CDs/trinkets
---
It's the same in BfA though, the basic rotations are pretty easy to do. It's how/when to use different trinkets, items, and so on that is the tricky part. Especially when you add multiple targets. A sim for classic would need a ton of toggles for what consumables you have available.
---
the fun part is jumping down off the top
---
The client we have is literally from Blizzard smartass.
---
Imagine how confused he was...when I played the first time...I was confused about sooooo much things :D
---
Seriously. Have been doing the same thing. Actually lowkey a life saver cause you can do pretty much everything you need with it.
---
By adding more things to that list classic won't be anything like vanilla
---
A few weeks ago I queued for Timewalking dungeons and the whole group actually talked during the run. We ended up running dungeons for close to 2 hours, and friended each other afterwards. I haven't experienced that in this game in YEARS.
---
Nobody cares about you or your answer mate, keep it to yourself.
---
Move aside, guys. We got a certified badass over here.
---
same. I was hoping it would be a lesser played class so I can keep some exclusivity. Why the hell is priest so high? I would like to see a further breakdown of alliance priests vs horde priests. As an ally player, I'm hoping most of those are undead priests.
---
&gt;  if a competitive class (i.e. not a druid)
---
wtf
---
They have not said no to RP-PvP servers for launch, they've said they'll concider it if they get enough feedback.
---
How is that so hard for you to understand?
---
1. Blood and gore in videogames is not allowed in any way- shape or form in China.
---
2. Removal of blood and gore lowers their PEGI rating from 13 to 7 in western markets.
---
**Blizzard is being greedy**
---
This is exactly why I love classic. Going away and taking a break has no consequence
---
I will NOT be playing classic unless this change is implemented. Ridiculous.
---
Indeed. A well played and equally geared druid with the right spec easily has a 90% win ratio over a mage. There are a very small amount of well played pvp druids however compared to the amount of mages out there. It bloody lovely though for those who specialize in mage killing. ;)

It takes like 100 hours to hit 60 and about 2 hours a day to run endgame dungeons provided your in a solid guild that doesn’t wipe on dumb shit.

I'd love to see something like Neverwinter's system: When a player is doing something for the first few times, a text alert warns the group that there is a new player in the instance (without mentioning the name of the player) and everyone gets a bonus for completing that dungeon.
---
If you can’t spend time leveling then you won’t be able to spend time farming gold anyway.
---
You would have to respec well over 20 times to reach the gold cost of learning it. Unless you respec frequently it would be upwards of 30 times.
---
"All the common jewish folks of Europe would have long been forgotten if not for the holocaust."
---
I guess not but given that I will probably be playing more than the average player that took 10 days played to hit 60, I'd think I will have less rested than they would.  I can't imagine an average person hitting it in much less than 200 hours played.
---
There would be a lot of toxicity no matter what. Wow is an mmo, that's comes with the territory. How much of it a new player will face will highly depend on a server, level and a role.
---
It does apply, the damage is pretty negligible though.
---
100h for the average player? Are you joking? That's basically the world record.
---
Same. I actually never played on that type of server before.
---
I just know I appreciate a deeper level of immersion than what pure PvP servers give me.

Lol

I would be pretty nervous about skipping the neck. I mean..... What are you going to use instead, until you have naxx on farm?

I can't tell if people on this sub are for real or not. He said that they said it's gonna be in the game, and was left out by mistake in the beta.

I don't think you're wrong, I think many of the modern players posting stupid shit on the official forums are just fair weather fans. I'll rejoice when they're gone after the first month. I know that may sound bad to wish for anyone to quit a game, but the fair weather people are gonna leave regardless and when they do I don't think it'll be anything to worry about. I've got an even more unpopular opinion I think though, I don't think a lot of the streamers like Soda and Asmond are gonna be sticking around either. Soda's my favorite streamer, but I really think at this point, after WoD if you're seriously still able to summon the will to play modern for an extended period, they clearly like where modern is or are extremely desperate and naive and will continue the endless cycle of getting burned and just don't see them playing Classic more than continuing false hope for modern.
---
Scholo is love, Scholo is life!

It is true that the private server scripting is inadequate, but not on ordinary trash pulls. Specially linked packs like you'd find on live, where if one is pulled then all pull guaranteed, are comparatively rare, and this is not handled incorrectly. Anyway, that's just my opinion and for the most part I'll make an effort to find people that want to play that way. Obviously I wouldn't just join someone else's pug that they took the time to form and insist that we do things my way.
---
I think when, for the thousandth time, you've seen a warrior inch forward to near facepull range, spend 2.5s plunking a mob with his crossbow, watch him run back around a corner so it LOSs, watch the mob completely finish its cast before processing that the warrior is out of line, and then watch the warrior fully tank the mob till dead in whatever corner he's using to line, before coming out and starting the process over again, you'll understand what I mean. And that's not bad warrior play. That's textbook tank pulling in vanilla.
---
What is this “be sweaty” meme?
---
Not playing melee for sure if that is how it launches.
---
I think your main focus should be farming cash, milionaires are made in the first few months of classic, it gets much harder afterwards imo
---
You are correct that only elite gamers will probably hit 60 in 4 days, but, if you’re citing a 15 year old record to predict the future you’re not too bright.
---
People have gotten down to 3 days 7 hours on private servers with BUFFED mobs that have shit pathing, I wouldn’t be surprised if some people got down to pre-72 hours.
---
Downvoting because the truth... or even just realistic views shal be scorched from the classic sub.
---
People hate being told not to over hype or get to tingly
---
Pretty good list. Looks correct to me and provides you wih alternatives for every slot.
---
With hindsight we know exactly how Blizzard fixed, or didn't fix, each healing class. 
---
The same reason you are choosing priest is why everyone is.
---
&gt;needing BOE items is the only way to avoid issues.
---
Exactly.
---
The second a pug member thinks it's fine to greed  on it is the second they effectively 'passed'.  
---
Then we get messy situations where two people greeded and three needed. The three who needed did so because they thought "it is known". It's just what you do to prevent ninjaing.   
---
In those situations I saved my roll and needed as well, and if I won I could give it to a greed roll if theirs was higher than every other roll.
---
To be honest I'm surprised this hasn't been talked about more often! I noticed it right away and it really needs to have both the blood splatter and impact flash for melee to feel impactful, no idea how it's gotten this far without it.
---
well at least I'm able to speak multiple languages =)
---
&gt; If the population remains high or even grows
---
Realm population is never as high as it is in the first week or so. We've been through enough expansions to know this for a fact.
---
Also, the population tends to spread out over time which also alleviates the problem that layering solves.
---
I don't see layering being an issue worth worrying about.
---
Congrats!

Ppl raging about wipes in dungeons and leaving groups instantly 
---
This Rushing and complete play like the guide said mentality 
---
And All the other things like that they do in retail wow that makes the game and community break apart
---
It’s more like a I’m afraid it will happen than a not looking forward
---
If it was mages AoE farming that will not be possible in Classic as mana regen works differently, mobs can randomly break frost nova, and DoT hits twice as hard as well as casters spawning inside melee groups. The spawn timers are also very different and much slower in Classic.
---
Lol rolling need on everything as well
---
No, because you usually have the option of simply running away from the Warlock. That goes double for Priest because they don't have spammable CC.
---
The only classes that really pose a challenge to Mage are Hunter (any spec, but BM pets can be really annoying with Bestial Wrath) and Druid (any spec with at least 21 points in Resto for Nature's Swiftness) because they can chase a Mage down and force him to fight. 
---
Of the two, Druid is probably the hardest to deal with because they're effectively immune to all of your CC. You have to make them burn through their mana by making them shift out of CC and chase you down. It's a battle of attrition that you can't escape from.
---
Hunter is always a threat because of their burst potential, but you can generally beat them by deadzoning them. If you let them slip away, they can burn you down pretty quick. If they're BM and they pop Bestial Wrath when Ice Block is on cooldown, you'll definitely going to feel some pain. If Blink is also on cooldown, you're probably gonna get chunked.
---
I am not the only one! Yay.
---
Kinda wish you could click on some sections to expand the data. For example would like to see how many warriors chose main role as dps or tank. Would be interesting, but that's just me nitpicking.
---
Hahaha, oh man, in like '99-'01-ish we were online so much that my parents just ended up getting a second phone line to the house which went to the computer. Just a few years later, cable internet became more widespread and eventually replaced the extra line... just in time for WoW to release, in fact.
---
Thinking back, the gap between the second phone line and getting cable internet feels like it must've been a somewhat significant chunk of my life. In reality, it was a really, really short timeframe.
---
ah great to know, thanks :)
---
Find fun or efficient ways to farm gold and farm raid consumables (Whipper root tubers, rumsey rum, winterfall firewater)
---
Maybe start leveling an alt to 35 to get their professions up.
---
Read the part before that
---
Spent too long grinding elite mobs outside dungeons for phat loots
---
My very first character that i deleted in the 30s was a prot warrior it got to a point i could not kill mobs a lvl or two below me. I made so many mistakes leveling prot was just the beginning i also purchased weapons and armor from vendors as well as a couple bags. The reason i gave up i was lvl 37 and had 18 silver. My next character went a lot smoother and i actually started learning the game.
---
If you plan on playing hunter for the long term, you better be an amazing hunter or your raid leader won’t bring you.
---
I recall horde being the more complained about one. Alliance has more RP and involved BRD. Horde one definitely involves warlords commands, which... well it had multiple phases.
---
Originally originally, people often ran lbrs with raid groups kinda zerging around. It was a bit dumb. There was one warlord's commands document, and three bosses you had to kill. Documents could spawn in one of four locations. So to accomplish warlord's commands in these zergs you had to drop group with the tag on three bosses, and be the first ninja to take documents. I did not heavily participate in this, but witnessed it.
---
Then for a bit longer we would five man it and still only one person could get documents. Much much better player behavior and much less trouble.
---
In the modern 1.12 version that I believe is to be released the documents respawn for all five players just fine. Still a random location, but you're killing all the bosses anyway, so no big deal.
---
That is the "hard" quest, IIRC. After that you run Rend and that gets you your good trinket, and maybe there's some more filler.
---
UBRS key is also another chore, but I assume that's the same for both, and is more world running around.
---
There is one thing that nobody mentions. Spider belt. This is a cloth belt that anyone can use and it has no cast time and is a gnome racial, with a 30 min cd. So if your an undead you can have BOTH!
---
I fucking love having decently sized offline documents like this to read when there's no reception at the doc's, etc. Thanks for linking!
---
Did they butter it, too?

reading this thread is giving me goose bumps. I CANT FUCKING WAIT !!
---
Found the rogue
---
Take the neck, defense isnt really a good stat and thats all thats the main focus of that trinket. Just make sure you press shield block and you will never have a problem. Hp and armor is the way to go.
---
ive said this exact same thing. People talk about how good they were ect but what if macros and addons were removed. How good are you really. I played games looooooong before cheats existed in game even before the game genie came to nintendo. Games were quite difficult and not for the faint of heart. Todays games are an ABSOLUTE joke skill wise. They have to be to appeal to a larger audience. 
---
What i would have loved to see was a whole new mmorpg created by blizzard with gorgeous realistic graphics and unrelenting dungeons and complex trees allowing for massive customization on how the class works. Today sadly most games are INSANELY easy to get into. I've tried countless games and nothing appeals to my ability to strategize via complexity in a MMORPG. Its like the world of gaming has become accessible by even neanderthals. I would have loved to see them redo the franchise with updated engines with realistic graphics and recreated the game by fixing where they went wrong. 
---
I was excited for the classic release but from what i've read recently i have no interest at all now. I played the game from the start for many years and even by the end of vanilla it was getting easier. Patch 1.12 imo was the beginning in a long run of mistakes which seems to be what they are continually going to do. At this point, I'm about to go back to playing chess as games today seem to be steering torwards that quick thrill. That's not for me however is quite frankly the problem with todays world. People can't see past their noses and are oblivious beyond then that instant gratification. Sad really.
---
&gt;You (and a lot of other people) have just decided at a certain gold value it’s ok to take gear that drops away from someone who wants to equip it.
---
The argument is that bop are worth more to the one who can equip than those who can't. 
---
An item may only vendor for 7g, but someone in the party would have paid 100g if it were BOE. It's worth 100g to them but only 7 to everyone else.   
---
If that item were changed to vendor for 100g, suddenly it has the same worth to everyone in the party, in terms of gold.       
---
In terms of feelings, it's different.
---
An upgrade that just dropped feels amazing. Winning an item that you know sells for 100g that will eventually lead to an upgrade feels less amazing, on average.  
---
What is fair?   
---
That everyone get fair compensation for being part of the run. If there's a BOE that only drops for a certain class in a dungeon, is it fair that they get dibs on it?  it makes it more profitable for that class to run that dungeon than the other classes. They're getting a greater share of the loot than other players on avg.  If the dungeon has a chance of dropping a BOE for every class, that makes the avg compensation more fair if only those who can equip can roll need on BOE's.  
---
I'm cool with either of the rules, as long as they're universally agreed upon. All need on BOE or only roll need if you need. What I don't like is inconsistency, and people having different expectations when it comes to how we should roll on the loot.
---
I chose Other, as that seems to be how they coin us now.
---
An?
---
Not to sound mean or anything. But what did you think the answer would be? If yes, how would people see into the future to determine if the population will be balanced?
---
Legion sucked.  BFA sucked.  They both sucked for the same reason.  Literally the same garbage.  WQs and infinite resource grinds, oh yeah keep grinding till you get your bis legiondary/azerite traits.
---
Ho shit, I missed this point. I'm the tank as well for my friends group and none of them played vanilla, not during vanilla time nor on Pserv. I gonna need to explain some mechanic because they are retail MM raider and MM+ pusher so they usualy try ultra hard on the dps meter.
---
You’re right, I was assuming my p server got it right but it seems you were right. Mea culpa.
---
Yeah, I'll be playing druid, priest and paladin. With all I'll heal at the endgame. Can't wait for release.
---
It's funny though. I always played dps, but then I started a priest and healed a dungeon and even got thanked for doing a good job. Since then being a healer has grown on me and I just love healing people and helping out whenever and wherever I can.
---
I played warrior but didn't pick up any defensive abilities. I was thinking "why tf would I want things to attack me? ..
---
Got invited to a raiding guild and kicked after the first raid. Good times.
---
Yeah, I missed the first survey, somehow. Hoping to see some really interesting demographics this time. I'm wondering if other people are like me and have never been near a private server.
---
yep invis mages were a huge pvp issue and warlocks aoeing an entire zone were an issue many non locks had with them.
---
i actually joined in alpha and was thru  most of beta. The betas of blizz pre D3 games are usually ridiculously fun, since balance is usually out of the window or the bugs are hilarious. E.g. in wc3 undead would create a gy spawning skeleton zerg that would go all the way from undead base to enemy base or in wow I remember a common bug whereby jumping off a little tree or even going down step would cause dying due to fall damage.
---
There is nothing wrong with purchasing bags from vendors
---
Probably American and confused by month being second, as it should be
---
Not necessarily a guild, but a solid group of friends with different roles.  
---
It helps with dungeons a ton, if you have 4-5 different people you can whisper directly, rather than "LF TANK, UBRS" for 45mins. Also, you know their skill level which helps immensely.
---
My friends and I have a saying for WoW.
---
*"You never quit. You just AFK."*
---
This is a good-ass survey. Haven't found a single answer lacking a selection option for myself.
---
Except they time to do the long ass attunement chains
---
You can still ignore them to never see the name appear you know...
---
~~M'lady~~

---
&gt; Why would a dps paladin stack int cloth after 40? Paladins only use cloth when healing in pve, nowhere else.
---
Because he'd be *leveling* dps. Do you know paladins who raided all content as a DPS Paladin? Paladins end up as healers.
---
Which is why Paladins tend to have two sets of gear.
---
Can't read. Eyes glazed over with internet rage about small effect that is a beta bug. Real important stuff. . .
---
Hahaha an extended afk
---
I don't think anything is warrior vs frost mage impossible.
---
Blizzard is already a Chinese company.
---
While spending 150h getting another alt you could just... Spend 150h grinding gold. 
---
30gold/h=4500gold. You could reroll at least 90 times.
---
You should get the neck, no discussion.
---
Mark of the Chosen from Maraudon and Styleen's Impending Scarab from BWL are bis anyway.
---
The neck is BiS for fury and a very good threat piece for tanking.
---
I'm already seeing them compared to the first 20k answers of the first survey. Priest is strongly set as 2nd most played class thus far in this survey. Only beat out of 2nd place on Horde side by Shaman. 2 of the top 3 classes Horde side are primarily healing classes for PVE. Pretty interesting!
---
On board :) while I wouldn't mind if classic sucks me back in and I actually push to clear naxx with a guild - I'm fully expecting to hit 60, wait for bgs, do a couple WSG, get to rag once and not much more beyone that.
---
It's pretty much a 50/50 for me - I'll for sure hit 60 with at least 1 character so when I get that mmorpg itch in a few months classic will be there to have fun with, but I don't care enough to put a dozen hours in per week for months in end.
---
But quite a few people around did appreciate it. It contributes to a more diverse approach to skill up engineering.
---
I for myself have a complete different leveling strategy for eng since I’m going to make the most money possible out of it. But I can appreciate the approach and I’m open minded enough to appreciate the effort of the creator and that it at least gives folks some more options to choose from.
---
I hope people still share there stuff. It’s a great community benefit.
---
Besides the prices are fairly high buying a 6 slot is one thing but i kept buying them.
---
And why would he need to collect cloth gear at 40 then? He is dps all the way until 60 in your premade 5-man group, he has zero reason to collect healing gear before the endgame dungeons to prepare for raids.
---
Lol, wrath babies...
---
It's a simple calculus, this universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.
---
Counts as "My battle station is ready" as well!
---
?
---
No China has a much more censored version of wow as it is, editing out death, undead graphics and much more, a little blood editing for China alone wouldn’t be that much work for Blizzard, google China wow censored version you’ll see the diff
---
As a hunter I wasn't afraid of any mage, except for the crazy pom pyro weirdos. But it requires anticipation, you can't just engage the fight as a normal fight.
---
The blood was done way back before the undead changes etc. It was the first attempt by Blizz to appease China censorship needless to say it wasn't even close to enough.
---
Fish a years supply of winter squid.
---
Came for this. “Coherence” is already a noun. No need to nounify it with -y.
---

---
Saw those "200+? You're doing it wrong" comments coming from a mile away... since you know, only hard ass gamers in this sub.
---
You are right though with the math :) 
---
I've told friends that never played vanilla to just keep in mind when 8/26 comes - even if you played 12 hours a day it will still take you on average 20 real life days to hit 60... so don't feel rushed to hit 60, anyone that does it within the first week (probably has issues) so don't worry about hitting 60 in a record pace.
---
It's dumb to just say take your time and have fun, but the leveling speed all comes down to how much time you spend on not killing things - if you do professions or make alts - that's where the extra hours start adding up. 
---
It's okay to have multiple level 40s and not have a 60 - 60 isn't the only point of the game so have fun :)
---
Haha. Agility can't hurt. I need to be agile!
---
Collect tier 0 for the sweet tier 0.5 stats
---
Sneaking into Hyjal was super fun, and pretty easy to do without any exploits. All of the terrain was actually there, and some interesting objects and features too!
---
&gt;I reckon we get news on one of these things this week. Either Tuesday or Friday. What're you expecting?
---
Could guess any day between now and August 12th they'll release some type of info...
---
I'm hoping when they do speak up it's not just server names and types that we get, but phase information too - estimated time gaps between each phase would be nice 
---
Of course they said later phases would be influenced by the community, but give us solid information on phases 2 and 3 so we can get a better grasp of when we will stop playing classic and when we'll come back.
---
UD looks way cooler, but the stun resist is so incredibly good. As an ally lock I always struggled with rogues. The stun resist will help a ton!
---
I think this might come in close for that

Classic and retail have loads of data and video files that they share. When i was installing the beta i figured to put it in separate install folder and noticed the install size went from \~4gb to something like 8-9gb. So just installed it into the same folder so save some SSD disk space.
---
Retailclown at an attempt to troll.
---
Yep, slow tanks are cancer.
---
Oops, forgot the other pic in the album lol.  https://imgur.com/BvKDz8D
---
Freakin' brilliant work, and should be compulsory reading for all the devs to know how they messed things up.
---
I tried retail after having quit vanilla sometime around TBC, and instantly got bored to death because every encounter was scaled to the point of being extremely easy no matter what you did or where, so I ended up creating my own difficulty by pulling ridiculous amounts of mobs just to have some fun.
---
And after a number of times of being unable to play with my friend because of being in other quest/PvP/world phases, and twinks at every BG bracket being even further promoted via experience locks, there really just wasn't any fun to be had anymore.
---
Thank god that classic is about to set the record straight.
---
I thought about this. Bandage is a slightly better version of cannabalize. Situations where you have to bandage and  cannabalize later because your bandage is on cd are pretty uncommon.
---
I played Alliance!
---
Just wondering, wouldn't warlocks have a hard time finding groups in a RP environment?
---
They seems way too shady for your average human paladin to recruit
---
You can backstab from slightly further back than the 90deg side of mobs. This felt the same to me in beta as it did in vanilla.
---
For certain mob packs cleave has to be better than heroic strike right?
---
I remember being the first guy to try fury warrior (BACK IN THE DAY) in our guild. People said I was mad for putting points in improved cleave but the damage I could pump out in certain fights was insane. My reasoning was that improved cleave puts cleave not that far below heroic strike in damage bonus, and you hit, you know two things instead of one and do less threat.
---
so many fools unable to even recognize a basic enchant and mistake it for a druid skill even... sigh
---
Ugh, why couldnt you separate the class distribution by faction? Still paladins and shamans not compareable with others without calculations.
---
Someone ninja looted the Baron's Mount.
---
Then he became so infamous that all he could do was sit on it in Ironforge and nothing else.
---
you won't be, lmao
---
And the average player who cannot devote a huge amount of hours every week is going to take much longer.
---
Yeeeah....I was thinking the same thing. 
---
Maybe I'll come back if/when they add it. If that's not possible, then oh well; not like my entry is a big deal anyway. :P
---
1. My first char shaman orc - didnt know gamę, didnt know Thottbot. The early quest with pickaxe in imos Cave. It quest there was Cave in the North. I was running aroind durotar for 2 days looking for that Cave.
---
2. Undead warrior on 16 wearing clothes and dagger. Couldnt kill 1 mob 4 lvl power than me.
---
Next char was druid which i was playing to the end of tbc :)
---
fuck ugly toads
---
ud for life
---
Machine-gun imp probably benefits from them muscles quite nicely.
---
My big question to this. How do you keep your gear up to date doing this.
---
I'm hitting 60 somewhere in the first few years maybe
---
Don't know how much it matters in AQ/Naxx, but at least I used to raid in the #1 server guilld in MC and BWL as a dagger spec, and it was never an issue. Didn't notice any combat rogue outdoing others on the meters, but of course back then things weren't as gamed out as they might be today.
---
At this point I'm more inclined towards believing they're scrapping the second stress test entirely. I don't think they would try launching a stress test with earlier than a week in advance and I don't think they would host a stress test less than 2 weeks before the release (both due to potential organizational issues if it fails and due to name reservation thing already being online).
---
I know that even using my own logic they could still host a stress test next week if they announce it in the next 3 days but I simply doubt it - given how completely silent they went after last stress test, I think there're some internal issues they're battling through, maybe actually related to layering, and they can't comment on things until they're greenlit by Activision.
---
Now you have to play Ali no other choice
---
Only works for US i assume. 
---
Have read this for weeks now and it’s not showing up on any of my pc’s on, all with the latest version battlenet
---
you just saw trivial content then. It is true that normal and heroic dungeons are braindead zergs. But you only do them while leveling (you dont have to).
---
At max level, you can do mythic dungeons. They added Dungeons as endgame content in legion. 
---
And those mythic dungeons are extremly hard. Last week we tried a +16 tyranical atal dazar and couldnt finish it in 2 hours. and then we had to go offline because it was already almost 1am. 
---
that dungeon was by far the hardest shit I have ever experienced. It was totally doable, but we played bad and just failed to beat the endboss. 
---
those mythic dungeons need much better communication (you just cant beat them without voicechat at some point). You need CC, Kicks, Purges, invisibility, need to kite, line up cds. pretty much everything that wow has to offer needs to be done in those dungeons.
---
And the mobs have sometimes really hard mechanics. if you fail to do those, you just die and maybe even wipe the group
---
Pros who run those dungeons (yes, there is a pro dungeon scene now) sometimes discuss the stratage for a certain dungeon for over an hour BEFORE they even start them. So saying you dont need CC or strategy isnt something that applies to retail
---
Cataclysm and everything after it sucked
---
Very good point about R14.  
---
I know a hunter that pushed rank 13, but stopped because he had [ashjrethul](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19361/ashjrethul-crossbow-of-smiting). Smartest MF I ever met lol
---
Stunning grenades and net trinket come to mind!
---
yeah there was this one guy fuckin accusing them for segregation just because they had guild recruitment channels labelled as "other" instead of "oceanic"
---
what the fuck does he fuckin expect, the channels labelled "other" were already used once in a blue moon, yeah just split that up even further sure
---
Chuck Norris once chatted in The Barrens...
---
That's why it was ripped in half
---
Everyone in the raid can get a minimum of 83 from the UBRS buff, everyone who's in a group with a paladin will get 143 FR without any FR gear. Spam Greater Fire Protection Potions, they are cheap.
---
By the way, non-garbo guilds ran MC without stacking FR on everyone even back in early Vanilla.
---
Honestly gear doesn't matter much while levelling. But you do keep up anyway because you will get a lot of greens drop. You can obviously do any important quests that give really nice gear if you feel the need too.
---
It's barely a 'feature'.
---
&gt; 'Did they just turn this on to test it functionally to make sure it worked?' That's accurate. We set the thresholds much lower on the beta than we would for live because we wanted to make sure we were actually testing the feature
---
That's actually *very* promising to hear.
---
Somehow I managed to not have kids by 29 haha.
---
Just use the addon.

glad to hear he's still around.  The few interactions I had directly with him weren't bad, but the trade chat hate was something special.

**&lt;Game Knight&gt; NA-PvE on PvP | Alliance | Tues/Wed 9PM-12AM EST | Social &amp; Raiding Focused**
---
**Who Are We?**
---
&lt;Game Knight&gt; is a North-American - Alliance - PvE Guild that will reside on a PvP Server. We are looking to build a great community for Classic World of Warcraft!
---
**Our Goals:**
---
We are motivated to become a Competitive Semi-Hardcore Raiding and Social Guild, as well as a successful Community.
---
**Our Expectations:**
---
We have significant expectations of trial-members who wish to become core-raiders, but **don't require anything of those looking to just participate and have fun within the Guild**!
---
**★ All core-raider positions are merit-based. ★**
---
**Core-Raider-ONLY Requirements:**
---
1. Level 60 within three weeks of release on first character.
---
2. Level 60 of each armor type, come later raid releases, if you want.
---
3. Full World Buffs and Consumables for Raids.
---
4. PTR testing before every new Raid Tier release.
---
5. Profession requirements (e.g. 300 Engineering).
---
6. Assisting world resource control.
---
**★ All raiders will need to be able to take constructive criticism. ★**
---
*~ Nothing is personal. We encourage everyone to ask questions, develop as a player, and become the best that they can be.*
---
*~ We can’t necessarily mandate a PvP ranking requirement. We will, however, be strongly encouraging PvP rank development, and the guild will divert a significant amount of resources and effort to PvP. This means coordinating PvP brackets, forming guild pre-mades, and forming world PvP groups to farm honor.*
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesday/Wednesday | 9:00-11:00PM EST
---
**Guild Culture:**
---
We want this to be more than just a Raiding/Social Guild. We want it to become a community that transcends World of Warcraft, and extends into other Recreational Games to have, well... Game Nights!

Wasn't a huge fan of WotLK either, tbh.  It was fine, but very clearly the beginning of the end.
---
It just triggers me that people always come to reddit saying Legion was good.  It was dogshit for the first... 6 months?  I don't even know, I barely lasted 2.  Anyone who willingly stayed and played during that period, then comes online to defend it disgusts me.

&gt; Slower weapons with comparable stats are obviously better

In the start, yes. 1-2 years in you don't give a crap anymore. You'll be tossing the kid around like a football, while the kid has the time of his/her life. "DAD FLY AGAIN, DAD FLY AGAIN!!".
---
I would argue thought that in Classic you're playing your class, while in retail you're playing the raid. 
---
The last retail raids I played (WOD and Legion) it was totally irrelevant which class I played. No mana management, every 3 seconds some proc which lights up my screen like a christmas tree and every class had a heal, every class had damage mitigation, every class had dozens of movement abilities.
---
The raid mechanics themselves were definitely harder but I much prefer actually *playing* my class and *feeling* my class. With strengths and weaknesses other classes don't have.
---
Real decisions, Horde vs Brother. I think we all know the correct answer here.
---
As the other comments said: warlock, priest (shadow), druid and a good shaman (especially elemental). However, mages have a huge toolkit so it's not 100% impossible. You should also consider that mages have an easy time escaping these encounters (a stupid druid might even go oom shifting out of sheeps, I dunno...).
---
I think they’ll release the final gold client in the coming days.
---
With that client they will do the final stress test and then use it for name reservations, which I assume will be similar to Beta in which you logon to WoW as normal and create a character but the Enter World button is greyed.
---
They are definitely still running lots of internal stress tests behind the scenes as well as test for level 60 content, leaked by this [slip-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cekzl0/beta_available_again_character_templates/) that shows pre-made 60 raid testing.

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [What Should I Play Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread. This is thread is the best place to ask questions regarding class, professions, and race choices.

---
I think it would be 2019 if they add the effects we have in retail. after the improved environment graphics this would just add up.
---
You walk around in an beatiful looking world, but your attacks looks like shit
---
U literally just repeated the joke Chumbeee already made
---
Warlocks do an epic shit ton of damage. They just can't reduce aggro, or utilize all their dots in raids.  
---
Warlocks are awesome in 5 mans, extremely useful in raids, and godlike when they're solo. Not to mention, there will only be a few other warlocks around to take your gear.  
---
In contrast, I've been in raids with 10 mages.
---
I was wondering if they kept this in the beta, it's surprising nobody raised the issue before.
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-29-a-big-wow-classic-interview-in-the-lead-up-to-launch
---
Omar Gonzalez: There's some differences and similarities. We will likely set up a war room - like NASA Mission Control - where we have all hands on deck. On one hand, it's a little bit simpler, because what players will be doing is more known. But on the other hand, it's much more complicated because we've built out, effectively, a whole new infrastructure. That's something we typically don't do for an expansion. An expansion launch is much more of a software upgrade. Our Classic [launch] will include hardware deploys in all of the various regions - something we haven't done in almost 15 years.
---
yeah I agree, extremely dumb how these people think their way of enjoying the game is the "only and true" one.
---
Put your brother down for assuming such a thing. Lok'tar ogar!

Downvoting because this is a useless thread and OP could focus on his own life instead of supposably how people think they will do more then they actually will, wich is an assumption in the first place.

Overall just a terrible useless thread.

I don't, but you do assume Slow = LOL U BAD NOOB. Which is sad.

True. I remember not relaying on drops at all. AH was the way to get bags.
---
They already said it will largely depend on the community levelling speed and clear speed so you probably won't get this hard-line information on schedule now.

hey im the original shit poster and this falls under my 17 wives and 700 children remark
---
"LOVE ME DAMMIT, JUST LOVE ME ALREADY!!"
---
lol
---
That would be **very** inconvenient for a EU player like me, to be honest... : P
---
I was pretty decent in PvP as a warrior from the get go. I was ganking alliance in red-ridge by level 18 and continued to slaughter people all the way 60. Winning in world PvP a warrior is all about being super aggressive and attacking first.  
---
Group PvP is more about gear and having a good healer, thought that depends on other people's gear as well.  Early on in classic wow warriors with the arcanite reaper and a pocket healer will probably dominate BGs thanks to the high burst potential compared to the sort of geared players they'll be facing.
---
Okay not dailies but shit like weekly profession materials.
---
I am in EU and have the same thing, no classic is showing. I do hope they release it in decent time before release for EU aswell.
---
Yeah over at meatspin.com under old school. There’s RuneScape stuff there as well.
---
Did you even play vanilla? It painfully looks like u didnt
---
Hypocrite
---
Probably, but I really hope people keep it small. I want this to have a big lasting community and the best way to do that is to pull in new players

how you rush fast 60 and gather Black lotus ???? You need to lvl up herbalist . If you level gathering professions you CANT rush level 60

So you dont see the difference between making an entire thread focusing on what other people think or dont think they will do when the game launches and simply commenting on a dumbass thread that is getting blasted with downvotes that just happened to appear on my frontpage? If you cant, i dont know what to say LOOOL.

Legion was up there with TBC and Wotlk for me.
---
It’s a marathon not a race!
---
Will it be possible to get the full results? Last time google capped them at 10k iirc. I don't know what can be done about this, but having the complete data would be great.
---
Legion is better than post Toc and ICC patches of wotlk. Legion was just phenomenal. The peak of wow was Ulduar patch though.

There are many things between "not the most polite way" and "You fucking idiot".

Well not for horde, you have to do brs for that:)

---
&gt;Warriors in pvp = dead when solo.
---
That's true.
---
He was actually asking if Warrior is any good in pvp compared to other classes. For example if you're a pvp mage, you don't need as many consumables as a warrior and you also have more utility and are not as gear dependent as a warrior. 
---
So yes, to be the best pvp warrior, you will need to put the most time and grind into it. Some classes don't need as much grinding for pvp. But as was said earlier - you will not be the best pvp player as a warrior if you don't have someone with you. You can basically die to any class that can heal. They might kite you and heal in between while your health is depleting.
---
If you're grouped as a warrior with a healer class, you might be one of the best pvp duos.
---
You needed the SM key for strat live? I never knew that, as every character always automatically got it while leveling.
---
Send it to me, please. I’ll give it the respect it deserves.

For the alliance!

I heard he also puts the toilet paper in the wrong way. Just a terrible person
---
Always so many warlocks in these polls. In our group of friends who are playing there's only me and 1 guy who's heavily leaning lock so far. Fewer than 50 people sample size sure but even on the beta it didn't seem very popular at all.
---
Not as active, but if it’s well populated BG’s will pop frequentöy probably.
---
I wonder if wow classic will give that same sense of accomplishment. As a teenager you don't really have a sense of power or control so escaping to a video game is more appealing. Then again most adults hate their job and get shit from their girlfriend/wife haha.
---
Using something that has been fixed as an example of why they seemingly don't know "what the fuck they're doing" is truly this sub in a nutshell.
---
fuking lol'd at this
---
That actually sounds kinda interesting. The last time I looked, it seemed like hard for blizzard meant having a (tight) timer. I don't like speed running, so that really didn't appeal to me.
---
The amount of money I’d dump on this! Holy fuck I’d spend paychecks lol. They should make a tablet version of wow. Even a stand along dumbed down version I’d go for.
---
 "We will continue to listen to community feedback, and we want to know what people think and want to see next."  
---
Yeah well, I fuckin cross my fingers and hope the majority won't "vote" for TBC, and that we'll see the continuation of Classic, what it should have been.  
---
A game without flying mounts, without instantiated world zones, without infinite power creeps etc...  
---
I hope we get to see the real future of Azeroth. Let's say... Classic +.
---
First of all, through God, all things are possible so jot that down
---
Immature people. I've had good times in WoW, but also some of the most deflating online encounters.
---
There is not much to expect from this list just by the fact that they put 8/8 T2 QS tauren as a preview image. 
---
They recommend Deathbone set and Ironfoe as a first-hand choice just for the sake of saying that these items are bis according to their opinion and omitting "yeah dudes these are bis but you probably will have to make 1k+ runs to get all this stuff LMAO."
---
Secondly, this list is mostly based on the year 2005 (not even 2006) understanding of the game as all they do is stacking +defense in favor of other stats. 
---
Still, you probably can make a somewhat decent balanced tanking outfit if you mix and match gear listed in there (despite some very good items like Warmaster Leggings not being mentioned at all).
---
So yes, this list is not so good - first hand choices are barely obtainable, certain items worth mentioning are missing and you need to have an understanding of how stuff works to put all the stuff from the list together, which they also do not do for you.
---
I don’t need anything in Precision to be hit-capped?
---
The old days of looking up a quest going through the comments then getting the coordinates to only find they were wrong also.
---
It's not hard it's the time that is the problem.
---
That's because at this point politics are fundamentally broken in the US and kids that read that first part and are now wondering if they are the target of this part are right on the money because they think for da lulz or da boyz or whatever the fuck is their current meme is adequate for discourse, and they're wrong because they're 19 and stupid so of course they're wrong, but their parents say they're right, so they're aggressive.
---
Anyways that's Barrens Chat
---
Sure is easier to look the other way and pretend there's nothing wrong with exploiting and killing members of other species than it is to align our actions with our values.
---
Not talking to the 0.1% who train on pservers
---
let's hope it's an actual option in the UI rather than a hidden feature accessible by console.
---
I have no idea what I would’ve done without Thottbot back in the day
---
You might be right but i stopped reading after you mentioned dailies because that made it clear that you dont know classic at all.
---
Hey btw not sure if you know this but you only.need a sub to play classic. And we knew this information about 2 months ago.
---
Some classic barrens chat in the bottom left.
---
Wow that image brings back a lot of memories!! Both good and bad lol
---
&gt; How long / what kind of gear does it take before an Arms warrior is decent in PvP or a more casual Prot warrior is a good OT in raids?
---
The moment you find a healer who is willing to put up with whatever crazy shenanigans you want to attempt (PvE or PvP) and will heal you until they're eliminated (kill), and even then if they're a priest for as long as they have spirit form.
---
***
---
The 'gear' aspect is a trivial thing as opposed to a healer who can actually stay by your side whilst under pressure and not go insane.
---
Depends on what you want. Do you want to be casual and still compete with people who invest lots of time? Not really. But you can enjoy the game every time you log in so in that regard i would say yes
---
How do you not powercreep tho?
---
What should be the right professions? As a future priest (shadow levelling into disc healing) I was thinking of tailoring as the first one, dunno about the second one.
---
Engi is not a priority for me.
---
Just seems jealous and salty more than anything else....  oh and from his replies, clueless... dailies in vanilla /facepalm
---
How is crossrealm even related to this. Saying just battlegrounds will hurt pvp surely is no different?
---
Tons of people will achieve this.
---
I don't think it'd shift the favour towards UD, but considering that WOTF also gets you out of Magic Dust and Magic Dust being this 30s INSTANT sleep on Beta, I could see people getting a use out of it vs a lot more classes/encounters than just those with a fear/sleep/charm innately.
---
You can have an idea through this :

That link doesn't work for me, can you provide an alternative or the name/title of the paper?
---
You underestimate my power!
---
No seriously, we've been hoping Blizz does Classic for so many years now. We've been waiting for so long. I've got 2 weeks time off before release and another two weeks after the release. We're sitting right next to each other and both our girlfriends know and accept that we're totally unavailable in that timeframe.
---
It's all set up and I can assure you, 12+ hours a day will be the reality in those two weeks. After that, it's going down drastically but those two weeks are **ours**.
---
Now you can have the "thottbot" skin on Wowhead for that additional vanilla feeling!
---
"behind on theory." Nah, i'm ahead on reality. Keep watching baloney Skarm videos and thinking you're smart.

It's not misery for you but it is for someone else cause they are having to carry your dead weight. That's the part you're leaving out of your equation.

---
But you know... Outrage will get upvotes, just sprinkle some China stuff on top and sheep love it. u/_Falathrin_ ought to rename or remove his topic, since it's simply not true. But odds are all those juicy upvotes from clueless sheep are too good.
---
Druid, holy paladin, shadow priest, warlock, shaman, hunter...   These are your HARD Encounters.
---
r/rimjobsteve I guess :D
---
Are you telling a mage who wants to get better, to go watch a 15 yr old pvp movie of a fury warrior? Okay dude

they dodged the question what happens with layering and megaservers

Oh right, that's a good thing. I didn't realise that was happening

Ofc you can, and even if it takes 1 week IRL time longer you can still farm the hell out of those black lotus.

Crafting takes time, not gathering.
---
One pug who was a utter prick in a group consisting a few of my personal friends. 
---
As my friends and I had some standing within the server, that guy had to resort to changing his name to get people to group with him
---
I want to say something about that from a healers perspective.
---
My top-priority as a healer in a BG is to stay alive myself. I will heal everyone and melee preferably... As long as I can position myself in a way that is at least somewhat safe.
---
I will definitely not chase a melee so I can heal them when it means to expose myself to more and more enemies.
---
So if you want me to heal you, it's your job to stay within my range. Not the other way around. Ideally you stay close to me so you can peel off whoever penetrated our rows.
---
We don't know yet if we'll get cross-realm BGs, if we do then the queues will be the same on both PVE and PVP. If not, I'd wager there'll probably be a slightly smaller number of people queuing on PVE servers as a chunk of the population will be people who hate all aspects of PVP (a group that won't exist on PVP servers).
---
Mate, you linked an ancient video... Your petition is completely pointless because it has literally already been fixed: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/violence-level-returned-blood-effects-with-video/218202
---
You ought to rename or remove your topic, because it's simply not true. But odds are all those juicy upvotes mean too much for you, even if it's on false pretences.
---
You'd think (in the early days at least) that this would give an advantage to PvE realms who will be able to get better gear because of having less distractions in the open world.
---
After that I can't see any reason why you'd be able to have a true cross-realm pool
---
Good ol EU racism tho
---
Wouldn't they then have to remove all skeletons from the game too, if they are trying to cater to China?

If your class can be an orc, be an orc is my general rule. But i do really much prefer UD male casters. Hard choice.

I'm looking for a guild (Horde - PVP - USA) that is actually both into Semi-Hardcore Raiding and World PVP, as everyone seems to be ignoring world PVP as any sort of priority. If I have to lead the PVP raids myself, I'd be open to it, I just want some guildmates who would be interested in joining me.
---
Class: Likely will level both a Mage and a Rogue and plan to level them pretty fast. Would be very open to spell/melee cleave groups for leveling.
---
Raid experience: Played casually in Vanilla but cleared all content in TBC, Wrath and Legion when current. Skipped the other expansion.
---
Raid times can be flexible, prefer a mostly casual atmosphere but serious when we need to get stuff done (not too politically correct, and not entirely immature).
---
Even for rogue the rank is debatable, you dont use the armor that much and rogue correctly played is useful even with lvl 1 weapons
---
Gnome racial breaks snares and roots
---
Yeah now imagine having to use taunt in rotation.
---
For real. If they don't do shit like this than I'd rather them ditch spell batching.
---
As a mage you can always run away from the SL lock. That doesn't work for the warrior against the mage.
---
As a mage I was much more afraid of hunters or druids whom I couldn't get away from.
---
That...might’ve been me
---
Pulling an extra unwanted mob may wipe you easy
---
That's not actually true. You can have many different items with orthogonal effects making them all good in a different niche and setting. Once you introduce lots of items with the same effects but in different quantities, that's where the situation reverses.
---
You would be searching Mankrik‘s Wife

Aggramar EU?

Where did I say that slow means bad ? You can play however the fuck you want, on the other hand your comment makes it sound like playing slow is the only way to enjoy the game
---
I will definitely follow this advice. Hope there are others who are willing to do the same. 
---
As for learning the matchup I guess it would be a huge benefit to have played the other classes and learn their tactics but I don't really have that time. Was hoping there was some good resources on what you can expect in different matchups

Now if only I could find a white and slightly longer Cape:)

Except that it wouldnt.

This is so foolish and counter to the entire point of classic.  What fantasy world do we have to be in to think blizzard can suddenly just start making competent new content that's as good as what they were making in 2004.
---
We JUST got classic back and you people are already lobbying to destroy it.
---
Oh im sorry, did i exagerate? Calling pressing a button "daily quest"
---
👌
---
hey, that's as far as I've gotten as well. screw google!
---
Will the stones be inactive? They existed in vanilla, why wouldn't they work?
---
15% of people playing tanks while 17% playing warrior (dont remember % playing druids) seems unlikely
---
I never said quest I said DAILIES it does not need to be a quest.
---
What do you mean fix roguecraft?
---
I never said Classic should be touched....  
---
The Classic servers should be live forever.  
---
I was talkin about adding new content on different servers. You'd have Classic servers, and Classic + servers. 
---
Well it was all a dream anyway, won't happen.
---
You need to go outside.
---
yes
---
Well I completely agree that if it were possible, it would be great.   In an ideal world maybe that's what we'd get, though I do personally love tbc
---
No. I wanna kill as low lvl chars as i can.
---
The trinket really isn't that good, and the ring makes no sense to take on a Warrior. The necklace is the best choice by far as a threat piece for the tanks and as a DPS piece if you aren't tanking on the current fight.
---
Because in vanilla they didn't work
---
Amazing i didn't roll alliance till wrath just assumed it was always a human trait
---
&gt; If you are dedicated to pvp go engineering.
---
Starting in classic with engi, on a class which does not power farm money (like mage with AoE pulls) is going to slow down you a lot in terms of money, after all epic mount is a necessity and not just that.
---
Engi is insane for pvp but it's expensive and after all it's not that much of a necessity for a SP compared to other classes/specs. Alchemy+herba, as you said, is a solid combo and I'm more and more thinking about it, since it's overall a good choice for everything. Classic alchemy has some crazy potions for PvP.
---
Right hand side of the screen when you're looking at this very subreddit. There should be a "Use subreddit style" box ticked. Untick that.
---
&gt; *We're trying, just like we did in 2004, to make our best guesses in terms of what we're going to see and make sure we have plans in place to prepare for those so we can minimise the queues* 
---
Hopefully, they are better at guessing today, than in 2004. But somehow, I think they aren't.
---
It's intended, the classic feeling
---
Dots still suck in 5 mans in vanilla. Everyone does more dps now than back in the day and the mobs just melt. On my lock it was better to just spam shadowbolt even on multi-mob pulls bc the melees/mage would just blow everything up so quickly.
---
Hunter has been my main for many years, but I'm not a min/maxing number cruncher so I can't guarantee this is 100% correct, but this is my experience:
---
If you start attacking mob 1, then tab to mob 2 right after the 1st shot, you will start auto-shooting mob 2 with no delay in casting timers or animations. So no loss in dps. You can then tab back to mob 1 and start auto-shooting mob 1 and so on.
---
If you trigger a pet attack, the pet will use that attack on its current target (it won't switch to your target just because you click lightning breath).
---
In retail, I have 14 toons all at 110-120. I think I just want like 2 toons this time around.
---
Meanwhile COD fanboys are paying 50€ for remastered editions, which is kinda the same as classic...
---
It sure makes the game more alive. The version without blood makes the game pale in comparison.
---
You haven't seen the fixed build for yourself yet, it wasn't in the beta.
---
This isn't the only issue either, there's wrong floating combat text animations, right click to report, sharding/layering, loot trading in raids, inaccurrate nighttime lighting and flight paths just to mention a few. 
---
And there were hundreds of issues that the devs wouldn't have caught if players hadn't pointed them out during the beta even though they were obvious to anyone who played Vanilla back in the day which proves that the Classic dev team has neither worked on Vanilla, nor played it.
---
The team working on Classic
---
Many hardcore players are planning to AoE grind dungeons from 12-60. Granted, not all classes can do it, but it's possible as melee and as spell cleave.
---
&gt;No updated graphics.
---
Dont tell people lies.
---
You have updated graphics options that include things like totally new water reflections, new shadow system. Areas look quite different with those on. But there is a button that setups the graphics as "classic".
---
There are no new character models, new faces or hairstyles.
---
Then theres improvements based on server and client side, like WAY more shit on the ground, much higher draw distances etc.
---
\*laughs in hunter bugs\*
---
I had those same problems all the way to wrath. Killing the lich king as a healer that could only stare at the floor was something alright.
---
Yes the challenge isn’t day 12, it’s...day 14? Lol.
---
Sweet Summer child. I see you never actually achieved key master.
---
i eated mages on lock , fellhunter helped tho ;) but it wasnt win 100% , gear and spec based
---
Exactly..
---
Also, just go out 3 times instead of 4 in a month (for example). BOOM 2 months of game time
---
Exactly. That's what I love about classic, that even in raids for some fights some green items with high resistances could be way better than your normal raid gear, because survivability stats could make the difference. 
---
I remember to this day that we had this crazy warlock guy in our raid, who spend a lot of time optimizing his gear (even with single greens or blues) which resulted in him always being no 1 im damage (if he didn't aggro). I even loved stats like hitchance and defense.
---
Whay happens on raid night when you need to put 10 pings on blackrock depths.
---
There could reserve a quarter of the spaces on the prime layer for lower level characters, but these characters wouldn't be locked to the layer, so they could jump to avoid ganking.
---
Under the current system, they can still jump to avoid ganking as well.
---
I selected Other.... but yeah. Oceanic is hard to spell for some.
---
The Necklace is just too good for tanking, whether is the MT or the OT's.
---
Layering not sharding
---
Ironicaly the best time you will ever have in a classic dungeon is a warrior tank, 3 mages and a healer comp.
---
*That is one stupid orc.*
---
Damn dude. It's so specific I'm scared that you might actually do it.
---
It gets fun as soon as you find a resto shaman with imo windfury totem
---
If you always have a chance against your hard counter then it's not a hard counter.
---
With "right" I assumed some people will level with skinning and mining to make some extra gold, but change to leatherworking/engineering at 60 for example.
---
What ever works for you are the "right" professions so to say :)
---
You're not getting invited to SFK in my group if you didn't want to train Remove Lesser Curse. Just saying. Tried it before
---
Greate a mage in duelling private server and just go ham for hours everyday. You will be better than 99% of the classic player base when it is released.
---
&gt;  and falls apart after two months because they couldn't catch up to where they were before the splinter.
---
this is why u gotta think long and hard before leaving
---
only a few of the better players get a sweet spot again in a good guild cuz those guilds will be cherrypicking
---
fury war can tank any 5 and 10 man. you think im respeccing between dungeons and farming? pshaw ill just claim to be prot haha
---
Yeah that's also obvious as hell, sad that people don't get the point of a beta
---
In vanilla each class wont have that many spells. For an example, if you are dueling a warlock your main concerns to watch out for are death coil and spell lock (felhunter silence) you can bait both out. Iceblocking the death coil prevents damage and the self heal, also removes all dots on you.
---
Try and land the counterspell to lock out the shadow tree, thats quite important.
---
If you plan to raid, get your consumables. Those will be much more of a requirement than they were back in the days, thanks due to private servers where people really wanted to / were asked to be fully prepared.  
---
So have your flasks / pots / potions / sharpening stones / buff food / etc. - those can take up a lot of time on a regular in my experience, unless you prepare from the start and manage to stack a lot of them early on.
---
If you dont want to invest in any important professions, you should still pick up skinning. 
---
The leathers themselves sell well to merchants and is one of the best ways to get the 100 gold needed for a mount by 40. 
---
Well part of the 100g.
---
Lets just put it this way...
---
They know already what was OP and what was UP. Slightly increasing/decreasing values could greatly improve it. If something was OP and they slightly modify, maybe still OP but not as bad.
---
Leave the gameplay as it was, classes played at it was.
---
To me it still would be Vanilla but with improved class balance.  I definitely would rather take that than the same old broken stuff.
---
I can start adding that info into the videos, but for RFD they range from the lowest being 27 and the highest being 39.
---
They will. They announced that a while ago.
---
Wow, really? Like 70 ppl were online on the beta and it still layered players. Of effin course it was lowered?
---
If you don't fully loot it, it doesn't despawn.
---
Good point!
---
There is nothing else to be said

**Raid Times**:  Servertime / CET -  19:30 ~ 22:30+, Friday and Saturday for *40man/progression* 
---
+  optional raids during the week for zg/onyxia/raids on farm
---
**Loot System**: Loot Council 
---
**Guild Bank**: via Discordchannel &amp; updated google spreadsheet
---
**OUR DISCORD**: discord.gg/VquUGmu
---
___
---
**About us**: We are a rather young guild, formed only a few months ago with currently close to 150 members, consisting mostly of experienced vanilla veterans and/or """unofficial""" classic server players.
---
We intend to level at a medium pace. That means we won't stop to smell the roses or "explore" every corner of azeroth but we do not want to rush the game either. 
---
Instead we hope to do all sorts of fun guild activities together along the way, such as guild-only dungeon runs (off-meta builds aka. memespecs are fine, too), lots of pvp, etc.
---
Non-raiders, casuals and socials are very welcome to join us as well, as we're trying to build a big community rather than just a raid roster.
---
_____
---
**What we can offer:**
---
- active and well designed discord server
---
- organized guild bank
---
- spreadsheets for professions, rosters, etc.
---
- helpful &amp; experienced class leaders
---
_________
---
**PvE**: We expect to have a raid ready roster of ***atleast*** 40 people within about 2 months after launch and clear Molten Core before Phase 2 starts. 
---
**PvP**: While we're not too pvp focused, we still want to do some organized wpvp together during phase 1 and 2 and premade battlegrounds later on. If theres a high demand we will do even more PvP stuff, like city raids and duel tournaments. 
---
Most importantly, we wish our members to help each other, even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange!
---
&gt;*One of us is being ganked by those annoying undead rogues in lakeshire?*

**Goals/Hopes/Dreams**:
---
- big &amp; friendly community
---
- become a known and popular guild on our server
---
- PH4T L00TZ
---
- enjoying Classic together
---
____
---
**Recruitment**: We have a pretty balanced roster and don't lack any specific classes right now so we're recruiting every class and role (except Main Tanks for Phase 1).
---
We still need a warlock and a mage class leader though so we're currently looking for a socially capable player who knows the class inside and out in all context and is willing to help others. Class leaders will also be part of the loot councils and recruit more members of their class if needed.
---
If you're interested please contact me on Discord **[Howaito#3139]** or join **OUR SERVER (discord.gg/VquUGmu)** so we can get to know each other until Classic release!
---
***In any case, HAVE A CLASSIC SUMMER!*** :)
---
2 fury tanks cleave tanking ubrs is a lot of fun. Sure you need a little cc occasionally like a sleep on the the larger dragon pulls maybe... or a mind control occasionally but its pretty fun and fast. The blackrock summoners and dreadweavers have so little health that as long as you grab aggro on the melee mobs its easy peasy.
---
&gt; Maybe they know it's a war they can't win so they're offering a compromise?
---
Or they are planning adding tokens to classic down the road after people get used to the idea. To take their (BIG) cut of that gold selling market.
---
yep its alt right trolling now

but unlike pservers the gms on retaill will be actually banning them

Is there any brief explanation of what layering is because there’s so much argument and I can’t find anything conclusive. Is it just one giant server wide shard?
---
I think this would have been cool idea maybe 8 months ago when they still had time to implement it. This close to launch and after the beta has closed though? Too big of a change to try and rush through.
---
A CB/prep rogue with all cooldowns and potions is very hard for any class.
---
It’s a glum outlook but I think it’s pretty realistic. People have built this up to be the second coming of christ to the point where it seems they feel they have something to lose. Once it sets in that it won’t feel exactly the same as it did when you were a teenager I think the initial reaction will be anger. That’s where the groups i mentioned originally will show their true colors. Thankfully you don’t have to play with any of those folks and they are all extremely easy to spot by the way they type. The folks with measured expectations will still be here in 6 months when the angry ones won’t.
---
Guys what should I level for my 3rd alt????
---
Engineering is not *needed* for any class, it is useful for every class.
---
There are engineering specific items and that's incomparable to almost everything else in the game profession wise.
---
The reality here though is in vanilla if you want to PvP seriously the only thing you actually **need** is time, and lots of it.
---
r/expectedsubreddit
---
Is this sorted on priority?
---
Basically yeah a layer is an entire world, a shard is a zone, and there is a cool down for layer hopping
---
Are you using old reddit or shitty modern reddit?
---
it really is annoying
---
Having the ww axe at 40 is totally fine.
---
You are right with your sentiment though. But I'd rather run the occasional dungeon with guaranteed upgrades via quests than spend money on overpriced greens.
---
I'll run wc for the crescent staff, razorfen kraul for the corpsemaker and helmet and sm for the ravager, scarlet mail items and Morgraines might.
---
That and a few other runs here and there plus questing will provide plenty of gear.
---
2 week holiday is approved.  Will buying tons of chips and candies, ordering pizzas.  Going absolute nolife! :D  And I wear that as a badge of honor.
---
I hate summoning stone. Mostly because after their introduction I often was the only one standing there and all others were waiting for a summon.
---
No if I remember right they had some wonky shit that revealed nearby stealthed players or something
---
by end of naxx the powercreep is insane, would need a stat squish or something.
---
BWL on farm at day 13. When BWL comes in phase 3, some 6 months after the launch.
---
Thats what the 5 extra fury warriors bickering over who gets imp WF totem in their group are for :) "What do you mean you don't have a shield?!?"
---
You must be a wizard or something! Knowing more about myself than myself! I had no idea that twelve year olds could remember how WoW was on release! XD i misread the ladders while hurriedly trying to respond to your human shit equivalent of a comment. Here’s a thought, how about you actually try the encounters instead of going off of what some pro’s say? What’s considered hard to them is so far away from reality for the vast majority of players that I’m just going to ignore your ignorance. Cheers, kid.
---
But, but, but what if the layers are UNLIMITED!@!@@!!!!@!
---
There is no honor in this.
---
Yeah but you can fish the summer equivalent, since it’ll be gone for 6 months
---
The living action potion
---
As a warrior my favorite matchup is vs a good mage, if i fight a good mage i dont care if i win or lose im just having fun. With engineering the war vs mage fight is pretty do able for the warrior
---
It was obviously sarcasm
---
I'm using the old style
---
I don't think the average person here played Vanilla. I think the majority are WotLK boys that never played it, or played it for a couple hours here and there, and are mostly hyped to experience something they didn't really get to experience before, or were like 10 years old and barely even remember it.
---
My favorite was using priest levitate to climb up the walls of orgrimmar and glitch underneath. Also glitching over the worgen wall in silver pine.
---
"Set small realistic goals".
---
You are making a post telling us how to play the game ? Party pooper.
---
I too have a 1 week vacation for launch week.
---
In order to remove the guilt, I scheduled a certification exam for the morning of the launch date for US folk. The ultimate goal is to pass it so I feel like I've done something productive with my career, rewarding myself with WoW Classic for a time before I get gungho about my career progression again. The worst case scenario is I fail the certification, but then I'll be alleviated of the failure due to WoW Classic coming out the same day. It's pretty much win-win.
---
Because it is cool to sometimes see a gm. They should do this more often. Wandering around, casting a cool spell, maybe buffing a player and then disappearing. Would be totally awesome and that doesn't hurt anyone.
---
Well ofc. Would have been better without the mistake, still.
---
Especially in an ubrs group, half the group will roll on your stuff anyways. And the other half will all roll on caster gear.
---
You would be the first frost mage in history to fall asleep while rolling their face on the keyboard against a warrior.  ;)
---
*tap tap tap*  looks LD?  *heroic strike!*
---
Found the dwarf
---
If you take a week off and do nothing but play, sleeping no more than 6 hours per day and doing literally nothing else including having all of your meals delivered to you at your computer, you may hit 60, but probably not.
---
Hit 60, get some blues, max out my professions. Get attunement for MC and Onyxia.
---
Run dungeons with friends and just enjoy my time.
---
Can I bind a weapon from my backpack to action bar?  Swap it in mid combat?
---
This is why I'm glad there's german servers. I do use Twitch a lot but using twitch emotes outside of it is equivalent to people using 1337 speak and meaning it.
---
Have Monday the 26th until Wednesday the 4th off - plan on making plenty of steak and chicken / egg burritos I can put in the fridge / freezer, plenty of bananas, almonds and probably a few days of chicken breast/ rice. Couple packs of zevia / kombucha and plenty of water.
---
Expecting launch night to suck so I'll be planning on playing until like 9 or 10 am the next morning and then sleep until whenever... then the cycle of a dumb sleep cycle will be in effect until labor day :)
---
Umm they literally have layering for this
---
Yeah.. Blink and Iceblock both breakes stuns. so Thats not really a good tactic
---
I remember when my flight path bugged and I was beneath the ground and I could swear that there was a ship beneath the ground. I downloaded the Repack by Brotalnia, but couldn't find there anything :(
---
need for pet heal gear, rofl
---
cant have both
---
Engineering is a benefit to every class in PvP.  You don’t technically need it in the same way you don’t technically need gear to PvP.  But it sure does help.
---
I love that! This dude got his career straight while still trying to be the nerd he always strived to be :D 
---
10/10 Life goals
---
Nope because then that's sharding - which blizzard can't allow because they said sharding would never be implemented and they don't want more shit.
---
Layering is fine. 
---
It's temporary and if people find ways to exploit it and make 10s of thousands of gold - good for them!
---
&gt;This and this !
---
Man I haven't used reddit on a pc in forever... seems weird to do.
---
Yes but if they set the cap too high and those players don't leave before phase 2 what will they do? You can't have a server with 20k people and no layering and leaving layering turned on past p2 will ruin the game. A realistic server cap would be around 10k max IMO. They're gonna need to be quick to open new servers
---
Wow, it must have taken a stroke if genius to find this out.
---
nothing much. three weeks of vacationtime and a crapload of energy drinks
---
Hmmm no idea... I use old.reddit.com and it works fine for me - but then again it works fine either way so I have no clue sorry...
---
Try that addon @Wylf recommended
---
Private servers mob pathing are way off, and mobs are generally stronger than they will be in classic.
---
Fixed broken things, kept things that people saybarr broken but aren't. 
---
Classes have specs that suck and will get you refused an invite to a group.
---
A friend of mine got WoW a few weeks before me, so I was at his place watching him level his rogue. He would pull mobs one by one with a gun, never utilizing stealth, ambush, backstab, etc.  
---
At that point I didn't know how much he was holding himself back, but I remember asking why he didn't use stealth and his response was because "you move so slow and the enemies see you anyway."  
---
He was lvl 25+, had used rank 1 Stealth and had always tried to approach enemies from the front. Yeah, no shit it's gonna be useless like that.
---
You should be able to keep an extra Thunderfury in the bag space. Let's say that a hunter has a Thunderfury in the main hand, then, whenever the hunter is about to swing with the off hand, you make some kind of Haxx Macro that unequipps Thunderfury from the main hand and puts the Thunderfury from the bag space in the offhand and then when the Hunterwep Hunt-tard is about to swing with the main hand the Haxxors Maxxors Macro puts the offhand Thunderfury in the bag space and then equipps the main hand Thunderflurry with double Crusader enchants ofc for a max powa Raptorious strike and you also include a vicinity speak in the Raptoliscious strike saying whatever powerful annoying several lines of uber leet speak.
---
People downvoted me for ridiculous reasons. I was talking about endgame. If you are planning on doing anything at max level you want to do a mixture of two out of the three specs.
---
If you want to keep your pet out, you pick Master Demonologist as one of your big talents, alongside Ruin from Destro.
---
For survivability and some other utility as well as keeping your pet out, you can go SL/ruin. Soul Link I don't need to explain.
---
Keeping your pet out can be beneficial, especially if you're in the tanks party with an imp - blood pact helps out!
---
The best performing raid spec, though, is DS/ruin. This is essentially buff to destro spells while using Demonic Sacrifice. DS sacrifices demons for you and buffs you differently depending on the demon you sacrificed. You can then use a cool down in the Demo tree to reduce your summoning time by a great deal to get your pet back up, but only need when you want to sacrifice again. DPS loss otherwise. 
---
You can prio affliction while leveling, sure. You can't fully go through any one of the three specs, and it's misleading to say otherwise.
---
Yeah that sucks. Good luck finding a guild with likeminded people, I know it would have been ok with us back in the days in guild runs, but random groups probably won't work that well.
---
Most people will still take over 8 days at least.
---
Yeah. Play mages, a lot of them.
---
Beat your own class as frequently as possible then worry about other classes.
---
What about world pvp? Getting corpse camped for hours. Having to skip quests because the opposite faction is controlling the area. If you're not ahead of the pack you waste a ton of time.
---
Is this due to druid sustain ? Thinking of rolling a druid or mage I'm so on the fence
---
Yes plenty active.
---
He’s playing hearthstone
---
I WILL I WILL I WILL
---
So you want sharding is stead?
---
Dont forget to fix The combat text!
---
Not playing my priest this time around (because apparently half my guild already rolls priest for some reason), so I'm looking forward to being that rogue that pulls aggro and then cries for help.
---
Thank you very much for noticing this.
---
Its a little worrying tho to see details like this pop up 3 weeks before launch..
---
Ps:Did they ever fix the flight path animations?
---
You remind me from vanilla Blizzard forum. So lets just end it here.
---
Sehr lecker mit Milch und Obst.
---
That‘s exactly why my brother and I are gonna go the warrior/paladin route 😁. Easy Dungeons and nice wpvp.....i want it! Now!
---
I appreciate the retail sucks circlejerk, but if you think tanking is more challenging in vanilla than mythic bfa you need to do your homework
---
Oh really?! I didnt see that possible bug report on the beta list. I really hope it is included on launch, but then I dont know if it was introduced in Vanilla, as I started at TBC launch.
---
Are you an edgy kid or just a toxic player lol
---
Rep dailies of MoP still make me cry.
---
Druids can't be polymorphed, and rejuvenation is instant cast healing, so its difficult for the mage to catch the druid casting anything for a Counterspell. On top of that, shifting in and out of cat form to melee the mage is easy, and mages have very little armor so they take a ton of physical damage.
---
The quests are still there. I did them on an alt during BFA a few months ago and equipped the pieces to look like the plagueheart set. I'm not sure if there was a time restriction on the items or not though.
---
You just have no clue what you are talking about to be honest
---
The best part of Thottbot was it always hiccupped when it would scan data and somehow include items  that were in a player's inventory as a location the search engine 'found' an item.
---
Raptor Hearts - 20% chance dropped by Highlands Raptor, 0.02% chance drop by *Backpack*.
---
Sweet, just keep opening my inventory enough and I'll have all the hearts I need.
---
It was introduced in patch 1.11 so it should be in the game since it is based off of 1.12.  Maybe they've implemented it since the beta but all I know is I reported it during the beta in game and on their beta forums and no official blue post has been made.
---
Another list full of misinformation recommending +def gear. Sure would be nice if these list makers did some research before spreading this junk.
---
Just someone with thick enough skin that i don't need to worry about someone saying mean words on the internet.
---
Nobody has to GRIND weapon levels they came naturally. Legendaries came naturally and often. You have a thing for hating without reason huh?
---
Yeah, when I was leveling my Shadow priest, I killed a bunch of mages in the open world no problem. I laughed about it in guild chat, then fueled a guildie of mine who actually PvPs. He won 3/3 against me. Granted, I was new to SP, but I didn’t really have any counters for him, and I believe he had better range than me at that level (low 40s).
---
They have not said no to RP-PVP for launch?  Oh honey... if you just told me you couldn't read, or listen to videos I would I have helped you out!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQzlcmD-1ZM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2466
---
Here go fetch your mom and have her listen to this and let her tell you what they said.  They said no to rp-pvp at launch but later down the line they might add them.
---
If you need any help figuring anything else out just let me know
---
join this server and practise: set realmlist pvp.henhou.se
---
Almost all classes in BfA are the same and simple. They all use Rogue mechanics in that that no matter what they call them (i.e. soulshards) the are essentially combo points. 
---
Every class is different in Classic. Get hype, less than a month away!
---
Oh they had paranoia or something yeah was always hard against a human rogue, always got stunned first. I think it had something to do with how nelfs where always sneaking around,  i remember reading the book about alliance not having warlocks because fel and horde not having druids because elune but that got canned before live.
---
Wait. SAME FEELING SPECS? IN LEGION? Yeah. You didn't play for more than 10 hours total. I honestly don't know a point in time where specs were more different.
---
Thanks for the info bud! Lets hope.
---
Have you tried installing windows 98?
---
It gets worse in AQ40. And if they ever do TBC, after hellfire you'll want to go back to it because it got even worse.
---
Yes
---
I was mainly thinking about the professions mats you can make. The only other thing I can think of is buying out shop recipies that restock in X amount of time but you don't really need a alt for that. I'm so sorry I used the word daily. 
---
And I didn't mention anything about needing 60 either.
---
There was also Allakhazam, but in the age before search engines corrected your typos, no one could remember how to spell it, so they never used it.
---
I haven't played wow in years, but to cancel auto shoot I think you just hit escape key or click the auto attack button on your tool bar or the key where you have auto shoot bound.
---
By tons do you mean &lt;1% of players?
---
Might be those scholo plate boots
---
^ this is because as a warrior you can't really play Defense for your healer except just by killing the enemy.
---
I hunter of a frost mage of a rogue would make a good third to cover this and help assist down targets... but then you would start looking for a 4th :P
---
Removing power creep would just mean to stop character progression at some point. At that point people will stop playing because there is nothing more to achieve. WoW has infinite power creep because it's the catch of the entire game. If there was nothing you could do anymore to improve your character the game ends for most people.
---
"Community leveling speed"
---
This is a horrible idea. Imagine waiting 9 months for BWL bc half of all players are tourists taking forever to level.
---
I was certain they did, so I looked it up. If anyone else is curious, they were added in 1.3 but didn't have the summon function until the pre-BC patch 2.0.1
---
[sauce](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Meeting_Stone)
---
I think this post is garbage. Garbage that we see every day here and that we need to stomp into ground so we can have at least a bit of quality again.
---
LOL, Hey, who doesn't like some good home baked Bread?  Yeah, breed....  Thanks man.
---
I mean.. it is. So
---
Me not that kind of orc!
---
Jesus 3 weeks that’s insane
---
Cheers to the other 140 Pallies, our holy crusade will not be stopped.
---
I really want to know where this stupid ass thing came from. I see many people lately doing this and I just dont understand.. Is it supposed to make them sound retarded? Because its working.
---
*laughs in hunter weapon*
---
Senkard, a Paladin I played with on Boulderfist EU (H). We had the best BRD run ever one time. I miss that dude.
---
Theb interviewer didn't even know they changed the content rollout. like come on man
---
Thats because people arent as smart as us. 240 hours and 10 days are the same. The math is really simple. You take the 10 days and divide that by the negative circumference of the moon (because the moon orbits the earth) and then multiply it with the average number of days in a year (dont forget the leap years). Kids today know nothing of real math
---
Lol at all of the "less than a week to 60" kids...oh the rude awakening they will have.
---
Thats the best thing to do.  I did a lot of pugs on private servers , the general way it qould work was you’d find the group that didn’t reserve the piece of loot you need.  Ubrs is famous for having dal’rends + felstriker + flask recipe reserved.  I usually put those people on ignore unless 90% of their raid is their guildmates.  I find it incredibly rude to bring a full raid of strangers for you to reserve all the good loot.  Guild runs are different, specially if you fill one last spit with a pug.   Feel free to tell me if im wrong guys !
---
A bit of a minor thing, but I wonder whether they'd be able to recreate the graphical style of Vanilla. The game looks the way it does because of technical limitations at the time (as well as making sure most systems could run it), I'm a bit concerned that any attempts to make something new would look a bit forced or out of place. 
---
Any new zones, dungeons or raids would need new creature models and environments, so there's no going around it. I don't think it's a major issue, but it's something worth considering.
---
They most certainly are vending machines no matter what, as a mage you bring 300+ water to a raid. As for dps, the most reliable way to see how much damage they do is pservers like it or not. And obviously private servers have their flaws. But based on that mages are behind rogue/warr/hunter in mc and pre zg bwl. Then they overtake hunters with zg, then they are top dps shared with warriors in aq and naxx. So overall not bad. As for the playstyle though... Well on bosses you basically just spam the same ability over and over again and sometimes pop offensives abilities. On trash packs they can be fun with aoe. But mages are great outside raids, if raiding is your main thing I would not recommend a caster
---
&gt;What I don't understand is how developers think this is better class design than classic,
---
This part is easy: WoW was always, more than anything, designed to be easy, relatively speaking. 
---
Oh sure, they had that whole "to learn, hard to master" afterthought going on, but compared to any other MMO that existed in 2003, that was clearly so much marketing bullshit. The hardest part of WoW is organizing 40 people to hit the correct one of up to 9 targets, compare that to EVE's 1000+ players* all organized into subgroups that are dynamically combined to hit prioritized choices of an enemy fleet of 1000+ players and then tell me again that WoW is hard. 
---
So making the game easier (to learn) is fulfilling the exact aim of the game. 
---
*) Disclaimer: EVE's server architecture hadn't reached a point where it could support 2000+ players in a single system in 2003, so big battles back then were "just" 10 times as many players as alterac valley.
---
its not all about dps its how good People can handle his class.
---
'Working as intended' lol
---
What a delusional world you live in
---
To be perfectly honest what you describe is what differences a good player from a bad player. It’s not just pressing buttons in no particular order. It’s about pressing the right button at the right time and aligning your cooldowns for the right moment (followed by a bit of rng waiting for proccs). There has been some outstanding plays during the WFR in the eternal palace by different players across Method and Limit that just go to show how you can use those simple looking abilities to make an outstanding move that can be the difference between a wipe or the kill. 
---
Classic in the other hand is just pressing one button over without a doubt. Yea you can make some cool plays in pvp and there’s no doubt the range of abilities you have is much wider than currently. But you can’t really use most of these in pve based content. As a mage I just soak frost bolt for the first few raids. 
---
There’s no way you can ignore this fact and tell me that class design and the fun is comparable with retail.
---
Personal experience, hence the buttplug.
---
They will obviously hand out bans once they're detected through automates measurements that in indicate suspicious activity. What they're saying is that they are more worried about people botting for their own personal use. Detecting gold trading is easier to detect through automated analysis than bots that manage to circumvent their current security standards (which are really high). During Vanilla there were two very popular bots that had a huge impact on the economy. These days there are only very few functional bots (often owned by big gold selling companies).
---
&gt;But the models look better imo, maybe because higher resolution and AA.
---
The models are the exact same and they don't look any better than they did in the original 1.12 client
---
[Here your go.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/edit#gid=1232374595)
---
Yeah idiot next time read the post and read my reply to the comment. Retard.
---
You really need to come to terms that if anything else happens, at the very least it's TBC. I mean honestly, masses want TBC and it's already a functional game with even less work than classic, if we're getting one thing, it's TBC.
---
Now with that said, classic "plus" doesn't need to be mutually exclusive.
---
Hen hous google it
---
Lol can't do dps...you aren't making food and water during a boss fight.....what?
---
 Mages are Kings of Vanilla. And every xpac onward actually, but yeah. Top or near top DPS at every gear level, good AoE and Single target, good group PvP, good 1v1 PvP, good 1vX PvP, good farming, good leveling, good soloing. Literally the only class good at every single aspect of the game.
---
people can do w/e the fuck they want at w/e pace they want.  
---
doesn't bother me.
---
Weird right? Almost as there are different people with different tastes playing Classic.
---
Just imagine, Hah!
---
Shaman of equal gear for sure. Back in vanilla I would duel the servers best shaman over and over, and it was damn near impossible to beat him. They just have a little to much to counter you as a mage.
---
Horizontal progression - 
---
Add 4th and 5th talent trees but maintain the same 51 points to distribute (think Rift: Planes of Telara).
---
New gear with different ability distribution, set bonuses and procs, but cap the item level at Tier 2, Grand Marshall/High Warlord.
---
...and for Thrall's sake, add some 5 man content and low-mid level content, crafting content, don't just focus on end game raiding.
---
This is all assuming we do eventually see a classic+
---
I know what dailies in modern wow are but it doesn't change the fact that you can call other things dailies.
---
I'm a different bird
---
I'm playing fire mage on live atm and I can guarantee you the lengths you have to go to get top parses in retail compared to classic are incomparable. Spamming frostbolt is not my idea of difficulty. Classic will be enjoyable for different reasons than optimal dps rotations.
---
I didn't say a single word about pace. I was talking about the game being a bigger grind than a lot of people expect it to be.
---
Warriors are a pile of poop without gear and preferably pocket healers
---
On one hand, I agree with the fact that TBC is the obvious choice for Blizzard.  
---
A lot of people want it, it's already developped and it'll be cheaper.  
---
What I'm talkin about is more of a "what if" than an actual demand. 
---
On the other hand, TBC AND Classic + can coexist, as you said.  
---
I mean, the chances for it to become a reality are less than slim.  
---
But hey, I really think it's worth talkin about it at least, proposing fresh, plausible and good ideas, make it so that the devs know that there is a demand about it ( as slim as it is ). It's better than zero anyway.
---
No, Normal is the default difficulty in retail. They should delete normal and HC and make M0 Normal.
---
The pro scene is completely different in retail. It's literally organised by Blizz. People then complain that certain specs are garbage because they're underrepresented in the most niche dungeon scene. As if it affects them in any way whether people pushing +20 or whatever use 3 rogues or w/e the fotm class is or is best for a certain dungeon.
---
No attempt should be made to balance anything around MDI or RPvP or rated Arena all of which are completely niche activities. Instead the whole game is balanced around those which leads to homogenisation.
---
You’ll find an idiot looking in the mirror. 
---
Stupid Trollpost...
---
That's where I farmed golds for my epic mount back then.
---
They are pretty bad healers though...
---
I agree with you, but you can't argue that increasing damage values on underperforming dps specs would simply just make the game more balanced overall, surely in raids you would be right, but stuff would get fucked up in other aspects of the game.  You need to look at each class and each spell individually and test them a lot to actually be sure that the changes you make will make the game more balanced.
---
(TBC is a good example of how they managed to balance the game after the long beta test that we all call vanilla WoW)
---
I added the corpsemaker but leaving the level thing for WW because the game is about being social and it's worth getting it early.
---
Good ol glider :)
---
I hear that the Ginger fucked a plainstrider.
---
RP servers tend to only be "in-character" in certain locations or for certain events. Dungeons are almost always done out-of-character. Trade is out-of-character. Most people quest out-of-character.
---
And even then, people tend to apply a bit of suspension of suspicion with characters like warlocks, for a couple of reasons, namely that no one has the time or patience to try to explain to every single warlock (or edgy) player that in a realistic in-universe scenario they'd really be disguising what they do, which would also get shit on by the bad roleplayers who do things like just assume their character knows your character class 'because it's obvious!'...
---
An anti-warlock bias would be reasonable, but it's one of those things most communities have sacrificed realism on to keep things moving forward, basically.
---
IIRC there was also a somewhat interesting quest attached to that inn.
---
I remember escorting friends through stranglethorn to booty bay for their quest. Long and dangerous way for alliance at level 20 or so?
---
* You'll stop shooting while you're moving, but once you stop and your autoshot timer is ready, you'll shoot mob2
---
* If you quickly switch back to mob1 before the next autoshot at .5, it'll either shoot mob2 or shoot mob1. You're cutting it pretty close there. Or close to
---
* If you have the focus available, it should hit your new target. Theres *normally* no delay with that.
---
Maybe they will include it in a later phase for bag space realism. you had to go for a long time without keyrings in vanilla.
---
Downgraded Legion, IMO.
---
Is the alternative to keep the keys in your bags? I'm pretty sure nobody wants that.
---
It's not. Try aoe grinding on a fresh server. It's not gonna happen.
---
Honestly this kinda threads was posted 1 1/2 years ago. You came pretty late to the show.
---
Could you please stfu and enjoy the game.
---
You might want to come back in 12 month with a - told you so - and still nobody would care.
---
Right now not Act-Blizz is the problem. People like you are.
---
True haha, will be a smoother experience this time I believe. I remember valuing "armor" very highly at the time
---
I was mostly a melee hunter up to level 30ish as well. As i said... Huntard at it's finest
---
It wasn't used incorrectly. If a word has multiple meanings fine you can misunderstand what I mean the first time I say it. But if I explain myself you should be like "oh ok that's what he meant" 
---
Instead of "omg vanilla no dailies only quests are dailies Hur dur u stupid"

Here you go.  He explains it with some really good detail.  27:45 is where the Pally/Lock duo start.

Basic bitxh. Warrior / mage. D1 on weekends.
---
Yup
---
Yea the post says 27th
---
Ive seen this thrown around maybe it's phase 5 but then that leads to no real reason as to why something is in now or not because it's a 1.12 base game.
---
I think Allakhazam was my primary method for finding info on quests/drops for Everquest.
---
Alliance filth.
---
Maybe you should take an English class, so you can understand the language. 
---
"I don't think we're currently planning on RP-PvP" He doesn't even know at the time of the interview what their status on that realm type is.
---
"Certanly if there is a large demand for it, we'll add it" with "thinking" that it won't be avalible at launch.
---
So, tell me how any of that is "NO, THERE WILL ABSOLUETLY NOT BE ANY RP-PVP SERVERS FOR YOU".
---
Dude, why do you really try this hard to be wrong in something you clearly don't even care about?
---
Thousand needles with the quests up some narrow path was great, and then the shimmering flats at the end. Really impressive although, as far as I remember, not the easiest leveling experience.
---
I'm playing on a private server solely because of the population; every zone I've been to has at least 15 people. I would renew the official game if i knew I'd see the same numbers, but i know it won't
---
5 shamans chain lightning your group.
---
Unless you're one of the top speed runners in the world, you will not make use of aoe grinding while leveling on a fresh server. It's never gonna happen.
---
Yes he is  dueling mages
---
I don’t think people actually realize how long it takes to hit 60. To hit 60 in two weeks, you’re going to have to play 8-12 hours a day everyday. Much longer if it’s your first time. You can’t rush to 60 if you’ve never done it before. You’re going to spend too much time looking things up.
---
Slower weps are still heavily favored by pally and shaman thanks to SoC and WF being PPM based.  They never quite got faster weps right in vanilla.
---
Did it meat your expectations?
---
Eastern MMOs have it figured out. 
---
So many games let you increase your gear indefinitely, with the chance of losing it permanently. So like making it a +1, +2, +3 sword, etc. Each + increasing it's power, but giving more and more diminishing returns. And, after a certain point, each attempt can destroy the item permanently. Imagine losing that +11 armor piece for good and now having to start all over.
---
Also, things like soft level caps. Like imagine if going from 60 to 61 only raises your stats slightly, but requires more effort than going from 1 to 60. And then 61 to 62 is exponentially more than that. Like taking a year or so. At some point it takes you decades to reach the next level. Not impossible. So not a hard stop. But it's effectively a stop.
---
I'm sure there are more mechanics that can be thought up to allow progression without power creep.
---
That’s a single use case, there are plenty of others if you look for them. I mentioned it before in their thread but, sitting D in flagroom and mc’ing efc when solo or healer if in a group is pretty huge,
---
Popular opinion: your unpopular opinion thread is about as unnecessary and poorly received as all the other unpopular opinion threads.
---
Even if the content is good, tagging it in that way is an immediate turn-off. Think for yourself. Not every trend needs to be mindlessly followed.
---
That's either what you meant or you're really that dumb and think everyone speedruns to 60.
---
waiting years just to blow through it in 2 weeks - ill never understand that logic but glad you are getting this thing youve been waiting so long for!   
---
Jeeze man 12 hours super unhealthy to be playing a video game that long X\_\_x make sure you stretch and hydrate and shit!
---
Great idea!
---
Right on.
---
I'd honestly say Truefaith isn't worth it. 
---
It's
---
* 14 stam
---
* 6mp5
---
* 73 +heal
---
* 2sec reduced cd on fade
---
Compare it to robes of the exalted from baron rivendare
---
* 5 int
---
* 11 spirit
---
* 68 +heal
---
The 11 spirit add another +3 healing to exalted, so truefaith leaves you with +14 stam, +2 +heal, fade cd reduce, -5 int and -11 spirit
---
Afaik 4 spirit is 1mp2, so the 11 spirit are roughly 3mp2 or 7.5mp5 (~1mp5 while casting). The int is max mana worth over a minute of the 6 mp5 ticks. So assuming you cast constantly, you'd get a positive mana gain from 6mp5 after 75 seconds. 
---
You are looking at fade cd, which is irrelevant in 99% of cases, 14 stam, 2 heal and some minor mana regen after 75 seconds of constant casting. It's slightly better, sure. But is it worth levelling an entire profession for, which you drop later? I'd say not.
---
not sure why youre getting downvoted, slightly more accurate might be "high damage range" or "Slower weapon given 2 weapons with the same dps", but its absolutely true that weapon speed is just a proxy for something else. This is in contrast with pre-normalized weapons, with those speed could be so important that you'd take a 10% weapon dps cut to get a slightly slower weapon (barman shanker jumps to mind)
---
I’d much rather have TBC to be honest. 
---
The likelihood of Blizzard failing to address the horrendous power creep with a good solution is high. New content would need to be after Naxxramas progression-wise, otherwise guilds such as mine which will be in Naxx are going to absolutely demolish it. They can implement a sideways progression for resistances that only matter for that raid (such as light resistance for a Scarlet raid), but where would the entry point be in terms of gearing to start the light resistance climb? Do they just increase the level cap, invalidating ALL prior gear?
---
Would Blizzard just rehash Karazhan or would they actually make new content? From a shareholders’ perspective, which is safer? What about zones? Story? TBC for all purposes “began” the WoW story.
---
And that’s not even getting into how many players/guilds will be dead and gone, left in the wake of the logistic challenges of 40 man raiding.
---
The game needs an overhaul to enter Classic+. You could even say it needs an expansion. Which is uh, what TBC is.
---
delete arenas though
---
If you need to explain why you used a term in a way that the community hasn't used it for over a decade, you're using it incorrectly.
---
Those stupid basilisks that would turn you to stone all the time, oh god. Not exactly sure were, but they were somewhere on that coastline.
---
It’s really sad that there are so many people like you on this reddit which do not have enough intellect to distinct between their own and the opinion of others.
---
You have an opinion, we got that! But it’s not up to you to claim that it’s the only/right one.
---
This is what’s fucking up humanity. Sorry for the people that have to deal with your opinions at work...
---
Makes me sick... 🤮
---
You cannot substitute your own definition of something and expect people to agree with it though, and then argue when they don't agree. To use an analogy, what you're doing is calling your kitchen a living room. Sure technically you can live in your kitchen and it's a room, so you can call it a living room all you want... but people will correct you and tell you it's a kitchen.
---
Dailies in WoW directly reference a daily quest you can repeat each 24 hours. You cannot call something else a daily, because in WoW all it means is a quest you can repeat each day.
---
Till now only level phase. No plans after that for the moment
---
This is gold holy shit xD
---
100% fresh, 15 years frozen game
---
Mages are arguably the best overall class in vanilla, certainly the most developed, if I wasn't a healer at heart I'd go mage no questions asked
---
Dude any duo will be good honestly.
---
Maybe just pick two classes that don't compete on gear.
---
Sorry to say physics doesn’t change based on your school.
---
If you’re using daily in that kind of context on a wow forum and you’re not meaning daily quests then you’re using it incorrectly. Argue all you want, but you’re wrong.
---
5 man warlocks all summon infernal then work together to summon a doomguard
---
I literally took two weeks annual leave. 12 hours per day will have me at 60 if I'm better than 7 days /played
---
I plan to play a priest on a PvP server. I've gone thru several iterations of what I plan to do profession-wise and basically landed on this exact same idea. Plan to level Mining/Tailoring and then switch Tailoring to Engineering after I've made all of the gear I want.
---
For the Alliance!
---
Like a poster above said, Mythic raids are for maybe less than 1% of the players. For any other content you can more or less faceroll.
---
Well during add pulls for wrath you would just need to spam mind sear or w/e it was called. 2-3 mobs you place dots.
---
Comments of that type seem pretty rare to me..
---
I agree.  What I mean is that they could remove rough edges, even leave OP/UP but not so radically. Does not make sense to not do it really.
---
My meal prep involves clicking the "delivery" button on their website

---
Are you going to make money with Enchanting mainly by selling Enchanting mats, or by offering Enchanting services?
---
Most specs are limited by builders and not spenders in BFA, like you say if you know one spec you kinda know eight.
---
Problem is that most of them are so fucking boring. Affliction is all right, but playing without the eternal corruption or whatever the fuck its called in M+ is just such a fucking carpal tunnel eye-bleeding cancer.
---
Live to win, baby
---
Having alch doesn't mean you just have flasks to use that's just not how vanilla professions work. By having alch you get 4gold daily and the ability to make flasks at their lowest price(provided you have the recipe which cost around 400-1000 gold), but so does anyone who have a friend or guildie with alch and recipe. Engineering gives benefits that simply cannot be bought with gold like the others that is why engineering is amazing.
---
OK I am so confused by this. 
---
It says "Free to play until level 20" but then elsewhere on the site it says that you need an active subscription to play classic. 
---
So therefore it isn't free is it... 
---
Or does that mean that its free to WoW subscribers and then once you are past Level 20 you will then need to start paying for Classic as well as the regular subscription you have?? Consequently ending up with two subscriptions.
---
Its not very clear at all.
---
Lol. Note very class plays like a frost mage in a raid. If you want to reduce this comparison to a single class or spec than an easy counterpoint to your argument is today’s bm hunter. There is no real strategy difference between a good player and a poor one in this spec outside of gear and buffs assuming you’ve figured out which of your three buttons to press (it’s the one that’s off cooldown).
---
Anyway, the developers have posted several times that the last 2 xpacs have redesigned class abilities to streamline play in order to make the game play and rotations less complex. So I’m not sure how you have the impression that the game, as a whole,is more complex today. Certainly some specs have more buttons and interactions to consider but not all and it’s naive to compare the game based on outliers in either direction.
---
This website is complete trash on mobile. There’s an ad after every paragraph in a long article. It’s extremely hard to even read the content.
---
Dude you are doing it wrong. First you have to get popular and then you can milk the YouTube cow with reaction and opinion bullshit noone cares about
---
I think that's a blood elf line.
---
I remember we had two friends who were mages in our guild who used to just farm non stop in hearthglen?
---
We talking fury and prot
---
In my experience my hunter destroyed both Locks and Mages. BM build.
---
You would probably be better off hoping for a WoW 2 in the mold of classic as opposed to Classic+(which would hopefully accomplish what you want).  I think it is unlikely for atvi/blizzard to put in the resources for Classic+ unless they can somehow verify it will be a financial success. I can't really see how they could verify that unless Classic is/stays popular and TBC flops and they decide to try to milk Classic the alternate way Classic+ style.  
---
Right now they are hoping to milk the franchise all they can with as little development as they can.  If anything WoW classic was probably spun off/sold to executives as a move to recapture a significant portion of players back to retail, while costing very little resource-wise (win/win).
---
Ehh having feline swiftness at 20 instead of 30 is generally faster than the dps increase that balance gives.
---
jesus.. it's actually kind of too bad that new players will just google this in Classic. I want them to suffer the same way I did! After a few hundred raptors
---
the goals i have seen from friends and co-worker have all been super realistic. things like i want to hit 60 in 2 months and then do a bit of dungeon content and maybe do some MC. the guy that is quiting for studies said he is going ham 2 weeks 60 raiding within a month which is totally doable as for the first half of the year he has 2 grades to read up (about 10 hours a week of studies).
---
If you find any sites/resources for other 39/49 twink classes please let me know!
---
I find in funny how people think that a 15 year old game could be anywhere near complex as today. Alone the bosses from today require a much more complex class than it used to be. Classic was a piss easy game. With piss easy rotation, class design and boss design. The only hard thing about classic is getting 40 players together than can keep up with this shit. Let alone the fact that there’s classes with specs that you can’t even use?? What the fuck Die last that have to do with good class design? Please tell me
---
That's a helpful comparison. Thank you. Cloth dps won't roll on Robes of the Exalted, because it's only +heal, correct?
---
Still, I want to do PvP too, and the Stam would be good for that, so maybe that's worth it.
---
Pretty much both - selling mats is probably faster turnover, but services would be a nice chunk of change - especially if they don't bring their own mats. Plus as a Mage I'd be portaling people places - and PVP vs a decent Frost Mage is always at least a huge annoyance for most, lol
---
I've seen people talk about Skul's in 1.5.2 on WoWhead, so either you or the wowhead archive is wrong about that at least.
---
Sound advice for the most part. Lots of good options, people need to consider not getting that *one* BiS as that'll most likely not happen; instead, know which stats help you and go for those.
---
Not to be that guy but...
---
Morgraine's Might is garbage. You don't want fast weapons after 36 (WW). Ravager isn't great either, the proc is occasionally useful but often not.
---
An alliance warrior can get Bonebiter from the SM quests starting at 34. Horde are kinda SoL for the late 30s and are usually better off dualwielding Sword of Omen + Vanquisher's Sword, unless they spent money on getting the WW axe enchanted. Yeah, it sucks.
---
Scarlet Mail is really mediocre but the helm and pauldrons off Herod are amazing. Especially the helm, unless that axe skill helm ends up being affordable.
---
The issue with quest gear is that, as a warrior, you'll typically (want to) be a bit behind the curve in quests, so the rewards will also be of lower level. A 2g upgrade can be worth it if it represent a hundred extra health or 5% more dps. In the end, it takes money to make money.
---
When you factor in the rested double xp a died runner will not have 10 played days is almost 4 times as much
---
The bonus health helps with a BM/SV PvP Battleground spec I use.  All the damage is in your pet and you're very [hard to kill](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/0500320142521051-5-23050005) due to Spirit Bond and Survivalist.
---
My first character was a Tauren Hunter on Detheroc.
---
Good to know it makes sense as a plan, if I go for it. Thank you.
---
There’s absolutely no way you’re not trolling at this point.  No one is this stupid
---
I really want to thank you for taking the time to do this agian, almost every single answer from race, faction and class has changed since the last one but I am firmly locked into my choice now that were fast approaching the deadline.               
---
            
---
All I really want from Blizzard at this point is impact flash/blood readded, RP-PvP for those who want it and the names of the damn server list.
---
But i was excited
---
Let's not hold back: the key chain freed me from depression, I'm no longer introvert and I got the courage to propose to a girl.
---
I can't use this subreddit on pc, writing this on mobile
---
Yep, Op. Retail gameplay has landed in a strange place. I think they’ve come to recognize that players interests aren’t aligning with the current model and they are working to bring complexity back to the game via the next redesign. I think they need a top down resign of their current team management. The game has gone the wrong direction for years and they could use some fresh blood and new eyeballs on this thing.

**&lt;Crooks and Liars&gt;** **Alliance PvP**
---
We're a group of AQ40/Naxx experienced players who used to play on various top guilds of Vashj EU server, and as of right now we are numbering at around 15-20 core players with a few more old Vashjians as tentatives.
---
While it may sound a bit terrifying to join a group of people who know each other, in truth many of us have been scattered around the different realms over the years and are now coming back together to finish what we've started back in the days and enjoy the nostalgia. 
---
* **Guild Rule 1**: No racism, sexism or bigotry. 
---
* **Guild Rule 2**: Be nice to your guildies. We're all in this to have a good time.
---
* **Raids**: In a raid you're spending 39 other people's time, so respect them and spend that time well.
---
* **PvE goal?** Hardcore enough to clear all the content, but no more hardcore than that. That's actually quite hardcore by AQ40, and means less room for bad play as time goes on. You can play as any class/spec you want, so long as we clear the content effectively. From roughly twin emps onwards the pve content starts to put constraints on how casual people can be.
---
* **PvP goal?** Depends on how hard people want to rank when phase 2 comes around, and how the premade scene shakes out. Main focus as a guild is towards PvE progression though.
---
* **Loot**: Loot council, with a google doc that lays out priorities. *Example: Ring of Spell Power; prio1 caster DPS, prio2 offspec.
---
* **World buffs and consumables**: We collectively get the Ony head (and ZG heart when it's out) buff and head to raid. Getting the DM buffs before a raid or logging out to save buffs is not required of people. Consumables are a requirement, but you don't need to have flasks up for farm content. Don't show up to rag without fire pots though!
---
* **Schedule**: Sunday, Monday and Wednesday as of now. Raid times are 19:00-23:00 CEST.
---
*There will never be MC/BWL/AQ40/Naxx raids on fridays or saturdays.*
---
Feel free to PM me or add me on discord jonu#4691 for a talk.
---
Everyone and their dog appears to want to roll warrior, it seems.
---
My current setup (on a repack server) is me playing my Paladin healing/judging etc.. with 4 melee on /follow (3xWar, Feral Druid). One button for single target dmg, one for AOE. This setup is quite simple and you can mindlessly grind for hours spamming just two buttons.
---
I like the idea of spell cleave, but despite how great it sounds on paper, it requires far too much finesse to multibox imo. The pulls never quite go as smooth as you imagine.
---
Is he proposing?
---
I would also assume that Blizzard would buy any botting program available on the market, learn how to recognize it, then ban all players using it. So any bot available to someone with 0 know how is probably a near guarantee you will get banned.
---
Just getting you ready for classic opening day. 
---
You’re welcome!
---
this dude boutta do 11k dps in LFR
---
I loved TBC tabard system. If there has to be one.
---
I really wish I could've gotten into EVE, I tried it briefly but as a complete noob I just didn't feel "social" enough to start making friendships and engage myself further. And as they say, "the best ship in EVE is friendship" :)
---
Fleet commanders in EVE are nothing short of real life military leaders.
---
How do you go with dungeons? Can you mindlessly clear say strath/scholo? Contribute to half a ubrs raid?
---
Yeah, ya know I kinda missed it. It’s all the little things :)
---
LOL. Yeah if you played paladin or dk I guess it was.
---
Umm. Shaman T0 dropped and you got kicked because you needed it, fair enough. Rage pulling the next group, not a cool move.
---
But you saw that druid online in IF? That means, you were alliance, nobody but hunters wear mail on alliance and the stats on the shoulders aren't very interesting for paladins and warriors. So why would you get kicked? For needing an item, which would have been sharded anyway? Ridiculous.
---
Allright, but can i beat them?
---
4 days 20h is the current record on vanilla and that's by speed runners who constantly practiced this shit along with abusing rested xp. You're absolutely full of yourself if you're expecting to hit anywhere under 5 days played at launch. As a heads up, P-servers are known to have extremely overtuned xp ratios. They were found to be rewarding over 40% more xp on quests and kills.
---
I'd rather have the juicy bear burger, please. Easy on the plague.
---
Mage. Warlocks are amazing but take a certain micro-managing mindset to get through the 1-60. However, as a warlock once you get the hang of things down, you hardly every stop killing. At end game both are really helpful, mages will out dps locks but having warlocks in the raid with stones and summons is A+.
---
Same here. Bonus, it's almost certainly not going to have any streamers on it.
---
Fair point. However if you're playing PvE you can still tag yourself as PvP enabled to get some ranking, although it will probably be harder to come by.
---
I'm not really concerned about the phasing because it's unlikely that i'll make it to lvl 60 until battlegrounds are out anyway.
---
From what people seem to be saying, there's not going to be any issue in joining battlegrounds even if you're on a PvE server, so I think i've made my choice
---
It all depends; what are you fighting? do you mean world PvP? BGs? Duels?
---
The best thing about warriors is that they keep scaling with their gear as opposed to other classes who really don't scale as much with raid gear. While it's true every class gets stronger with better gear. The warrior, however, get a bigger increment of power out of it.
---
Fury Warriors are top DPS in raid. Also, warriors can take a lot of beating. Paired with a healer they are always a power to reckon with even in blues in equal situations.
---
With Engineering and certain items Warriors shut down a lot of classes (Hello Skull of Impending Doom).
---
no naxx pug would ever beat 4 horsemen. This fight requires a very high amount of coordination over a long period of time as well as good gear. There is a 0% chance a pug can beat this fight. I'd be surprised, if a pug was able to even make it there.
---
The only valid explanations for this are that this is a lie or that it's a pserver story.
---
Who cares if you do go on like a week binge. Just count it a cheat week that get back to your normal schedule afterwards.
---
I work Monday-Friday and those days realistically I'm looking at 4-5 hours if that's the first and only thing I ever do. Weekends, shit, I wont lie I'm a complete shut in I could play 12 hours easy but even factoring doing stuff with kids and wife I'll scale back to a realistic 7 for typical weekends so 64 a week on average which would be a month?           
---
But I have 2 secrete weapons That unfortunately not everyone has...       
---
 1) a wife who also plays and understands the addiction.          
---
        
---
 2) 2 weeks off from work I've squirrled away to leisurely go down this rabbit hole.             
---
Also I'm going to do something I've never done before, I'm playing warrior with wife when she can play but other than that I'm doing an absolute no matter what NO ALTS until at least phase 3 to prevent me from gimping myself.
---
could you imagine the lengths people go to to keep themselves amused whilst we all wait for classic?!
---
The numbers don't add up with people claiming them will only be playing 1-4 hours per day, but also hitting 60 within 1-2 months.
---
I have a boyfriend
---
Of course you can tag yourself, the reality is though you'll not only get less availability for people who will engage you in world PvP but more crucially there are less people in the pool of eligible rankers.
---
If there aren't enough people bracket 1 doesn't even exist.
---
Phase 2 will have a massive ranking advantage for PvP servers. Which sucks but that's the way it is.
---
I mean with an average body weight of 180 lbs, I'd say &lt;1% of the player base is easily tons (at a minimum 2 tons so 4,000 lbs.).
---
People that complain about snowflakes are generally even bigger snowflakes.
---
It depends what constitutes playing. I bought and played the game at the very end of vanilla but was never 60 and therefore didn't raid etc. I still selected that I played vanilla, even though I only explored a small amount of the content.
---
Except Blizz has minimum requirements to keep and cares about per-player efficiency in a way Nost didn't.
---
Warlock is much easier to play, especially if built right. It's easy simply because you have the Voidwalker and Health Funnel, giving you an on-demande tank at all times, while being able to sustain yourself through stones and tap and drain. Farming shard is literally a non-issue, because you can just drain soul at the very end of a healthbar. Then, if you build a sustain talent build, you're just a god, rotting enemies down while your tank is taking the hits. But that's for leveling; at max level, most classes are difficult to be \*great\* at, simply because you have to figure out how to utilize your whole toolkit properly, and knowing when to downrank spells to preserve mana.   
---
Mages are gods in pvp, but seeing as you're focusing on pve, the most you have during combat is Polymorph for cc and raw damage. If the tank's having issues, you can just nova and let him back off for some breathing room. However, the nuances to it are nice. Being able to sell your portals, always having food and water for groups, Mage is a good class.  
---
Honestly, for me personally, they're equal but just go about doing things differently. A warlock can farm up dozens of shards and stick them in the bank for later. So then, you could always have shards for a raid or party to teleport them to where you are. A mage is stuck with sending people to cities, but can be used at any time with no assistance with sending.   
---
I suppose the concept is this: The two classes play very much like their fantasy. Warlocks have power at their fingertips, just waiting to be unleashed. Mages are intelligent, they need to think on their feet and have a plan for when things go wrong. In that regard, Warlock is \*easier\* to play, but if I were you, I'd try them both simply because you're not sure which will feel more rewarding, regardless of ease.
---
I'd love to have a Warlock to rely upon. All the other utilities offered by other classes can be easily covered if you have cash (in case of healing potions and bandages and in case of food - food). Warlocks can provide SS and summon you which is the best utility in game from a certain point of view - it's the only class that can make you save *time* itself.
---
Looking for Flemish players, want to make sure I'm rolling on a server that has a lot of us. I'll be playing casually and be 6 hours behind since I'm in the US, but looking forward to meet new people.

Various stews and brown bread, so I can burn the shit out of myself the second something exiting happens.

Very last college semester starts the day before. So, I'll be in class watching discord blow up while my friends level up without me.

EU forums, so the chance of a blizz response is minimal.
---
Yep, agree completely. 
---
There isn't any reason to craft gear if you're limited on time.
---
I already took my vacation days. Had to get out; couldn't wait.
---
I have enough hours banked to book a couple days off for... "Going to the cabin." Decided to take Thursday and Friday instead of actual release. I'll obviously play Tues/Wed but having Monday off as well for labour day means I can just go hard Thurs-Mon behind the initial rush.
---
Definitely needed, in the opinion of someone who was played only for a weekend.

The last time I resubbed for a month and decided to stick around was MoP. A lot of people hate it and it had a lot of problems, but for me it hit that sweet spot and is the last time I raided endgame content (challenge dungeons + heroic raids at that time, mythic came with SoO I believe). Mists was the epitome *modern* WoW for me, as far as class design is concerned. Heard Legon was good, but didn't play it.
---
Beta burgers? How would those taste 🤓
---
I think you'll be fine, given that we are getting battlegroups especially. Since you are alliance, any faction ratio problems should be mitigated by the fact that you will have 3 other servers worth of potential opponents, and by the fact that the horde players tend towards bgs more heavily than alliance, so that should help even things out even if all of your battlegroup alliance factions dominate their servers.
---
Those system requirements hits hard.
---
Dude, classic is easy. If you're a healer in relatively decent gear you'll get invites. You don't need BIS.
---
There are much better options for flag defense.
---
If you're taking one of your main healers and having them afk in a flag room invisible, you're at a huge disadvantage.
---
And if you're shadow, you're already pretty lackluster in premade BG's so being AFK half the time is just going to exacerbate that.
---
Like sure, it's not completely useless like having + pet damage on an orc as a warrior. 
---
But it's more for just for having a giggle in Vanilla vs. being an actual powerful strategy that would warrant picking NE over the vastly superior dwarf.
---
I cant fucking wait, not getting every buff with 2 classes or asking "shit... can anyone here jumper cable?"
---
most games as they age tend to become easier in some way or another. Really there's two ways to simplify a game, social interaction, and complexity. dota is a very good example where it was turned into a incredibly toxic environment through introducing MMR and creating a environment where everyone socially was forced to be on "equal grounds". The social part is an actual game inhibitor which many people don't think about
---
Yeah this, except it’ll be skinning and tailoring till 40, get mount, drop skinning and level herb (easy to level with a mount)... then drop tailoring after hopefully getting the robes and levelling alchemy. 
---
Figure skinning is slightly easier to make money off 1-40.
---
At this point I think you're retarded. No point discussing further.
---
Sexism, oh my stars. Give this a rest and quit trolling.
---
i remember when i used to get butt hurt over stupid shit like this.  Ahh, i miss my teens.  :)
---
I just want to mention before I share this story I started playing WoW in 2006 when I was 12. 
---
One day I was running around The Undercity and a warlock ran past me with a Voidwalker... I thought they were two players running around together so I tried asking the Voidwalker what class it was. The Warlock told me it was a Druid. So for a couple of weeks I believed Voidwalkers were a Druid form. I even tried making one and confused many a player when I asked in general chat ‘When do druids get their dark blue bubble form?’
---
I have many a story like this...for example; when I first started playing I confused NPCs with real players, I thought the first person to need a drop won it but i’ll have to think a bit harder before I share anymore.
---
You can turn off the watermark btw.
---
Probably right, I just prefer to pick flowers lol
---
Rockethelm soul fire with warlock is rly op
---
Is there any graphics made with data of the first survey? All I can see is the raw data
---
Oh it's only skill level 175, I see. Do people usually use those or the thorium ones at level 60?
---
Retail tanking in m+ in Battle for Azeroth is actually VERY skill intensive, albeit in a different way than classic.
---
What about Wrath of the Lich King fans? What about Cataclysm fans? What about Mists of Pandaria fans? Where do you arbitrarily draw the line?
---
I say we draw it at classic. This is a project to revive classic WoW. Why not keep it at classic WoW?
---
Probably because it’s going to be nothing like vanilla and it’s going to be just like retail server wise/ sharding they just aren’t going to say anything until they take everyone’s money
---
Much faster than 72 hours? Let me be the first to congratulate you on the world record.
---
We have addons and other ways to filter out goldsellers from chat... we dont have anything to filter out their bodies and the ads they make with them.
---
Ive been playing WoW for a decade with an addon called Badboy-filter and i have never seen goldsellers in chat during that time. I still dont see.
---
But before that i did... so chat spam isnt a problem anymore, i havent seen body-ads either tho but i guess they did something to prevent that many years ago (i guess cross realm/phasing also affects that, it was different when every server was by itself) But theres no addon in existence to prevent that if it was still possible.
---
Mining is satisfying, and it will lead to world PvP.  100 % agree with you.
---
I was confused too. However, someone noted that they said there will probably be no trial accounts at all for Classic.
---
Yeah the dispell part was why I mentioned casual players. Not saying the it is the same, but it has uses in pve as well so I figured I would ask if they were in the same ‘league’.

A lot o&amp; th3 classic animations and texture require you to use lower graphical settings, like water.

You make a good point - I guess a big factor in choosing Enchanting or not is whether or not you actually want to go around looking for nodes.

nah, I know that there were more responses than 10,000 back then, too. Doesn't matter though, I'm looking forward to the results. When are you going to "release" the results?
---
I Vaguely remember this.
---
Well I made a post yesterday that got 0 upvotes and a lot of useless argument's asking if free trials, or as I was so eloquently corrected, playing for free up to a certain level is not the same as a free trial included Classic, anyways if you 100% need an active subscription to log into Classic and not just an account like retail up to level 20, I think that will severely hinder the gold spam market if not the farming bots, at least it would come with a cost to them to run their business. The best way to kill 3rd party sellers anywhere is to make it not lucrative.
---
yogurt makes you sleepy dude
---
 I have never really played wow (unless trying out some classes on starter edition counts), but I'm willing to try out classic. I am interested in r**anged dps** and **pve only**. 
---
**Which class is easier** to play - **Mage** or **Warlock** (Hunter isn't really my type)?
---
Real chaw yeah?  I hope you're not working with that shitty skoal...
---
Iron
---
Considering they just did an interview with eurogaming and there was pretty much ZERO new information and all the real important questions were ignored or their answer was “ We don’t know” I wouldn’t count on it. Seems like they DK WTF they are doing......
---
You mean a bunch of children that never played the game. BRD will put an end to that if it gets that far... more likely deadmines or uldaman. As soon as a mob goes running away because it’s at 10% and pulls another pack or two and wipes them every time that will end. That’s if the tanks can take the damage and the healer isn’t oom. It’s not going to happen. Heirlooms and pallies having a taunt ruined wow.
---
I hadn't considered skinning. I'll have to think about that. I think I'd make more gold with herbing though, wouldn't I? But requires more effort I suppose.
---
Sadly, the sample here still seems way too biased, based on the simplest ratios like ally:horde which are the opposite way of vanilla, beta or any pserver.
---
Also, I wish some more thought was put into it. Questions like the professions one are close to worthless. E.g. many don't plan to select 1, yet alone 2 professions for leveling, so they have to select bogus ones on the survey (which forces you to select 2), which throws off the data.
---
Druids can shift out of slows and roots, have an interrupt that locks the caster out of the school they were casting in, and some form of instant healing that the mage can't negate.
---
8/10 times if the mage wins the 1v1 against druid it's because the mage grenaded the druid in a frost nova for a guaranteed shatter combo.

Obviously you’ve never played this game...

Everyone keeps going on about the damn mages... :) Sure they are one of the simpler classes? I see a warrior tag. How about hamstring kiting, to take 1/3 reduced damage (or even 1/2 vs some mobs)? Not everything is about mechanical skill. Good MMOs (hell, good RPGs) are about more then twitch skills and complex, perfectly executed rotations. They reward knowledge, preparation &amp; creativity.

Hey, that’s cool. I’m not here to judge how you want to play. I will say I didn’t worry about poison too much though it’s pretty easy to bring the right consumes to a bg. I also don’t think an s.priest is lackluster on a team. But hey, it’s pretty clear we don’t have share an opinion.
---
Here’s a vid that I think does a pretty ok job of showing the value of a s.priest on flag duty
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee6qnw98khA

Check out his channel he has some decent s.priest content. Though none of it (to my knowledge) has anything to do with nelfs.

---
Dont train all your spells, buy nothing on the AH, grind mobs the last two levels
---
or they will keep going because the game is designed to give players carrots on a stick.
---
Every level gives a talent point, every other level gives new/improved abilities.... every one of those milestones you can visually see are carrots on a stick infront of you which will keep many people playing.
---
You can feel and see your character grow in power overtime... thats not something that can be said for many other games these days. Especially BFA, players actually lost power while leveling... its why people exploited speedleveling with the aid of 110 alts.

RP is an option in the "what are you most looking forward to" section. It has been selected by 1.8% of respondents so far, making it a pretty clear indicator of the fact that an RP-PvP server would be a huge mistake
---
I mean, sure, dps’ing in current wow isn’t rocket science but it sure is more complex than vanilla, let’s be honest here. The description you’re making shows that, even though you’re actually missing a lot of what the endgame rotations actually are once you factor in all the consumables, artifacts, traits etc. The boss mechanics are also, on average, more complex nowadays.
---
I love vanilla and think it’s a better game overall, but come on, give credit where it’s due.

---
I really liked the attunements but then again we almost never had to do this kind of thing since usually our recruitment requirements had attunements as part of it.  Exception being very early in Hyjal/BT due to lack of guilds that could kill Kael.  Different perspectives I guess and I could see how having to redo old content for attuning would be annoying as opposed to one and done.
---
Tbf I think he is actually retarded.
---
Then play a class that has a little more nuance to it in most situations.  For example the hunter top single target dps rotation includes using aimed shot, it has a 3 second cast, but does not interupt the cooldown between auto shots.  So if you have a 3.1 speed weapon, you can auto shot and immediately start aimed shot, finish it, and not clip your auto shot reset.  Manage it well, with rapid fire and eagle procs changing your attack speed during play and you will get more damage then managing it poorly.
---
You have to download a swing timer, and play around depending on your latency as well.  You also use multi shot.
---
Then there is good trap use, feign death to trinket swap during combat, pet micro, and more that come up especially in dungeon groups.  Finally you are supposed to kite on several fights, and can solo some content to farm gold, abusing a number of tricks.
---
Even in raid content, if you look for ways to maximize output, you can do a lot of neat tricks on all classes, and some classes have many that need to be used in your basic rotation.
---
Its just RP. RP servers are RP-PvE.
---
I want the PvP. Thats the reason im not selecting that one and probably a reason a LOT of people aren't doing the same.

yeah, same with the retail questions.
---
Well, you can make the same argument about the drop of the truefaith recipe. Yes, it's not bop, so you could buy it, but this will cost you a pretty penny yet again and the drop rate is far lower than for the robes of the exalted.
---
did horde have tremor totem in vanilla?
---
My thoughts exactly
---
There are people like me who will spend like all their free time on this gem and even take time off. So it kinda makes sense.
---
Well it's entirely up to the player to decide what gear to enhance or not to enhance :)
---
Plus it's more of an illustration to show that there are alternatives to just bringing out more powerful sets. I agree that this specific example might not fit in well with the current design.
---
Can you explain this to me? Is it halal because the burgers are touching?
---
That has also already been fixed, this video from OP is old and incorrect
---
Depends on either Horde or Ally. Much easier in alliance side, when you can use a pally tank with massive aoe threat. Then you can freely do aoe dps example on 3 mages. On horde side im thinking druid tank, due easy rotation, no stance dance, pretty good rage generation and swipe. Using my main raid char (shaman) as the healer as its going to be massively overgeared.
---
Still wondering what to use as dps... either 3 mages (good single and aoe) or mixed team. Mixed teams will be harder to play, 3 mages might pull pull bit too much threat. Need to learn the program setup for those too.
---
As always: I'll pick Warrior AND tank!
---
Dies at level 9 because he can't enter the cave solo against 2x level 10 mobs.
---
Goes back to character creation and chooses mage.
---
I think that halal thing applies to meat, which has nothing to do with mcdonalds.
---
Good luck finding my realm ;)

dont worry about it. most people here didnt even play in vanilla and they dont understand what daily means outside a designed quest.
---
We know better, there are several things in vanilla most people can do only once a day... that qualifies as a daily aswell. Its you who define what is a daily to you... not the game or anyone else.
---
If you only have time to do one dungeon run a day.... then consider that a daily for yourself.  
---
For high end raiders their "dailies" might instead include grinding specific amount of consumables.
---
Player created quests, who could have thought it possible? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
The only class/race that is S tier for classic  is Alliance Dwarf Priest. You can be a brain dead retard and still get into the best raids and be carried by your raid. Sure the best raids with the best players won't need to bring them BUT everyone else will.
---
Not to mention for most raiding you'll be sac'ing your demon for the buff. 
---
Great for 5man's/soloing though.
---
Fuck skarm

You guys sound awesome, and exactly what I’m looking for. I was going to roll Horde but I’m not looking for 20 minute BG queues and one sided wpvp lol. I’d rather be on the underdogs side in that fight. I’ll hop in discord tonight.

The +15 Engi is great even if that success rate stuff is wrong.  The +15 means recipes stay orange for 15 more levels giving Gnomes a better training path and the pets like the Battle Chicken and Arcanite Whelp get 1 combat level for every 5 Engi levels, so Gnomes' pets max at 63 while humans max at 60.

Hey look. Someone trying to control language. Cool.

In PvE centric raiding you can make an argument for WoTF giving you significantly increased time on target in many fights. 
---
For all other instances Stun Resist freaking OP.
---
I was planning on playing a hunter for these exact  reasons.
---
Honestly though I had already knocked most casters out of my options before I learned about that because of how bland their pve seems. There are neat tricks in the preparation for everyone, but man I need something to keep me awake during during some of these fights. I've always never been huge on pve, and having a one button rotation would just be like nails on the chalkboard.
---
I believe they did, but a totem isnt nearly as easy to use as a buff.
---
“Probably has issues” 
---
Sigh. You were almost cool. So close
---
It’s like a less surgery Gatorade, it’s a lot better for you and it taste better honestly
---
I think your definition of fun is in the minority. Wouldn't you be pissed off if they have a mage item to a warrior?
---
&gt; Incoming hate from people who think it's cheating.
---
Tell them, to go read the EULA.
---
&gt; I plan on playing 5 toons through dungeon content just because I find it challenging.
---
I'll do the same thing.
---
&gt; They being said I'm looking for some advice from those who have done this.. What are the good comps to dungeon farm?
---
You can clear all 5 man instances, but you might need to do some tuning in key mapping, and make a few macros a long the way. I'll be running 1x warrior, 1x priest, 3x mage, with a solo target build with minimal aoe. Higher level instances, will most likely require some CC, where polymorph and shackle will come in handy, with an a assist/target macro to CC different targets at the same time.
---
&gt;Tranquilou !
---
Any link to watch the interview?
---
Venruki and his squad literally aoe farmed SM to power level during beta
---
Something I should have included, is that when a private server released their one-year anniversary statistics, it showed the average /played to reach level 60 was about 11 days. That was for a private server, where I feel the player base is slightly more dedicated than Classic's will be. 
---
While it's definitely possible to cut that time in half, I agree it's laughable how many users respond that they're hitting 60 in under 2 weeks.
---
That debate has already been resolved Dead Mines is abbreviated to DM. While the fire maul dungeons include a compass direction, for example eastern wing of fire maul = DME 
---
Only spiteful contarians refer to dead mines as VC
---
BFA =&gt; Retail
---
Classic -&gt; classic
---
I think we agree overall, which is why I said that I think Vanilla is a better game overall. But I just think that criticizing the current pve mechanics compared to vanilla is the kind of thing that can make us look like fools. 
---
And you’re right that the LFR stuff is really easy, but that’s a totally different problem. Them making an easy mode version for raids was a really bad idea and I even recall some of the blizzard executives admitting it. But no serious players even play this game mode. The fact remains that the current actual endgame pve is much harder than most encounters in Vanilla.
---
Peeling for your healer is important. You have CC as a warrior, use it.
---
!RemindMe 27 days
---
This is why I'm rolling a hunter. Falling off in AQ40 / Naxx isn't a concern for me when they're amazing for 80%+ of the remaining game, and lets see if I even clear more than MC/BWL/Ony/ZG.
---
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of it is honestly just roleplay. If you're a dwarf warrior, how could you not be a blacksmith as well for instance?
---
All I really want to get across is that you can make money in countless ways. Don't spend hours levelling tailoring only to drop it because you only wanted one specific thing in the first place. Just do something that's fun and makes some money :)

Why do people think they will be unique in a game with just a handful of classes, it’s baffling.  Priest, especially horde priest, will not be overpopulated unless it hits like 25% of the faction which won’t happen.  It is their only defensive dispeller (unless you count warlock felhunter’s 8 sec cooldown dispel), it needs to be like 20% of the faction for horde to win group pvp, but it won’t even hit that number .
---
0.5 quest chain won't be added until AQ hits in phase 5 IIRC.
---
Broooo
---
this question should definitely be on the bingo table

If they can't make trial accounts they will just turn to email account phishing and use hacked accounts to spam in chat. Atleast that's how they did it back in the day.

So estimating we get the same 25,000 responses before you're saying there is a significant portion of players who will not pick up two professions by the time they hit level 60? What's the wait?
---
Only reason I’m going mage is because I typically used rank gear immediately for my shaman but now that rank gear won’t be out early, and they are only using the 60 sets, my shaman can come later and I’ll trick out a mage n farm tons of gold.
---
You can cleave a few mobs. Not 15.
---
People looking forward to Phase 1. Bitches please, I'm looking forward to the Thunderfury phase.
---
I'm pretty sure this is an unpopular opinion amongst modern WoW players given the complaints I see around frost DK apm on r/wow, but I *like* really simple, static/predictable rotations.
---
I'm not sure if it's just because I'm getting a bit older, or if it's because of ADHD, or just normal personal preference, but I like having time to watch the world around me. If my rotation is too conditional/complicated, I get tunnel vision in on my buff/debuff timers/weakauras and start losing encounter awareness really badly. I've actually picked up the habit of going to icy veins around a new xpac to try and find what rotation looks straightforward this time around, because what used to be the 'boring' subclass got changed due to complaints.
---
I'm always a bit sad when I see people pushing for some of the less complicated/'boring' rotations to get made more interesting, even if I understand why. I played combat daggers in vanilla and was pretty happy with my 30 second rotation of 5 backstabs and a slice n dice.
---
Well there’s gonna be a lot of people who actually get 60 in 1-2 weeks, the rest who think they will and they don’t, will just take longer. There’s nothing wrong with expectations, I think that the majority who’s going for world first is gonna fail not the 1-2 weeks guys/girls. I hope I’ll reach 60 with mage in 2 weeks, it’s doable, playing 12-14 hours a day. A bunch of people are taking 2 weeks of and dedicating it for wow. I find having a lvl60 in the first 2-3 weeks is nice, after this I’m levelling my main, priest/shaman, and expecting 60 in like 3-6 weeks cause I wanna do dungeons and max professions. Everyone has a plan, let us be hyped, I don’t care if you take 2 years to level, I know I won’t, because it’s your life, but telling us that our goals are too high, pls care about your own levelling don’t tell me I can’t get 60 in 2 weeks lmao.
---
My issue is I don't find a certain class fun because of something, but I love certain fun things you can do with each class.  
---
Warrior : Charging in and demolishing people with pocket healers is great fun and makes you feel like the ultimate badass.   
---
Paladin : BoP interactions with chests/wsg flag.   
---
Rogue : one-shotting low hp players.   
---
Priest : mind control.   
---
Mage : teleports, pom pyro.   
---
Warlock : unleashing an infernal over goldshire never gets old.   
---
Shaman : absolutely deleting someone if you get lucky.    
---
Nothing for Hunter and druid tbh
---
Can't believe this guy would just go around sharing your name like that. Shame.
---
Rogues as not that good in PvP, I mean they will win most fights as they can pick when they fight, but they are mostly useless in battlegrounds. 
---
Using a living action potion will also somewhat level the advantage rogues has in world PvP.
---
&gt;Take your like
---

Lets use the word grass.

If i was talking to a pothead and used the word grass he would first think of weed then i would tell him "no I mean grass" he would understand and move on.
---
You on the other hand are a elitist who won't budge on anything that isn't 100% wow classic. Literally a brick wall. I explain what i mean and you go "nonono there is no daily quests in wow" i never said anything about quests. This isn't even a argument. You just literally can't accept that I used one word that you are used to hearing with a different meaning.

I'll be rolling human. Fear Ward is nice, but usable in only a couple fights. 5% spirit tho, I can use that everywhere

---
Yes I'm the ignorant one lol, what is considered hard by the best players means a lot more then some random comment on reddit, most people would agree with what I said about the raid difficulty, just look at some of the other posts about vanilla raiding compared to modern raids.
---
That green is crap against bosses.  2% chance to proc, and you are only getting hit maybe every 2.5 seconds.  That means it procs every 125 seconds.  It's up for 60 seconds.   So on avg, it's 60/125 * 25 = 12 str, 12 Agility, and 12 stamina.  Now, if you were fighting multiple trash mobs, then sure, it might be up quite a bit.   It might be the best you can get, because there's nothing else, but it's not nearly as good as skarm says.
---
Yeah, it is roleplay, basically - "I'm an Engineer AND I get the stuff you need to make engineering stuff." I guess not wanting to have to sell a lot of stuff on the AH and then buy lots of mats is a factor too.
---
I'm not sure what I would actually take if I weren't going Tailoring. Maybe just Mining+Engineering from the start.

But you said that you didn't say in the poll that you're looking forward to RP earlier. It's a multiple choice question, so it's incredibly telling to see the numbers that low and contrast that to the number of RP-PvP "enthusiasts"

5 hunters rolling on every other classes gear
---
There's going to be a lot of people who botted in vanilla that are gonna bot in classic and be surprised over getting banned. Bot detection has improved big time in 15 years.
---
True, "played" can be anything from logging in to playing for 200 days played.  I still think 75% seems very high from such a majority young audience, but if it was just them getting the game and playing the first month because their parents didn't realize it was a monthly subscription, that can count as "played" as well.
---
It's one of the reasons why Dark Souls became so huge. You have 4-5 attacks and that's it. No 10 button combos, frame perfect cancels, air juggling, S ranks... Here are your couple of attacks, here's your dodge. Now master the ever-loving shit out of them or die tryin'
---
What an insane post.
---
Rotations in Retail have been simplified, made more and more equal or just plain gutted for the last couple of addons; no news there. As someone who absolutely abhors the way most Classic classes play in group PvE settings, I would therefore not wish for Retail class design, either.
---
MoP was the high points for quite a lot of specs, IMO, with my personal all-time favorite spec among them; Demonology Warlock.
---
The world of Classic with the addition of heroic dungeons in the vein of early TBC, as well as MoP-era class design, and a tad more intricate encounters in both raids and dungeons would be my dream of dreams, I guess.
---
Simple Classic is the next best thing, though; I'll take it.
---
This never was in vanilla. The manual is based on the last 0.12. The honor system exist at all at this point and it was just a plan, but of course was already added into the manual.
---
By the time the nor system was really released then, they changed dishonorable kills to just reduce your rank points.
---
&gt; In the late 30s you can grind jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows, they commonly drop items that vendor for 8 silver each, also you can grab some nice herbs in the area (fadeleaf, blindweed)
---
I feel like Shadowfang is more of a Epic Mount investment. Save it until the pvp people are getting bored of lvling and realise they wont have time to grind their pvp gear at 60 and decide to roll an alt. They should have a good amount of gold then and would rather have a 19 twink with BiS
---
Oh true I guess I was being conservative.
---
Addons and macros were in vanilla though. Not sure what you’re trying to say. And they don’t even really change the game that much. Doing things like FD+trap is easy without macros... who is not capable of pressing 2 buttons nowadays? 
---
The only inconvenience is questing without addons. But that’s about it. Not really a difficulty think. More like a time sink.

Uh, what?  Our guild had the server first Rank 14, he quit after he got rank 14.  We did recruit a couple rank 14 players into the guild, because we were a PvE and PvP guild, but at least on Burning Legion, a lot of Rank 14 members went poof after they got their Rank 14 rewards.

Chemical warfare: I'm just in the process of stocking up on crystal methamphetamine. I'm planning to play for 180 days without sleeping or eating more than my own skin. I want to be server first so I'll have to make sacrifices.

So even Blizzard needs to cancel private server specific habits.

Finally, Blizzard is advertising it!
---
Lovely how they base the manual of the last beta patch.
---
You can see the paladin description of seals are more akin to blessings. That's because in beta blessings were seals and the whole seal mechanic we had in vanilla was implemented in the release patch. As was holy strike being cut. They completely reworked the whole class this class nad that's why paladin was such a mess during vanilla.
---
Couldnt be more wrong. Tanking high m+ is pretty easily the hardest tank content the games ever seen, they solo carry the groups
---
Maybe you should play the expansion before making sweeping generalizations on how easy/hard things are.
---
Hardest part of classic as an individual raider and not a leader, is staying on top of consumables.
---
Not to sound condescending (really) but I stopped doing this in my early 20s because I quickly realized i'd never be the person that like..... makes the difference for them. The people who've grown into that state where they're just fine with casually calling their wife a bitch/husband an asshole are only going to change if they decide. 
---
Still, I get it, I've done exactly what you said before. Shits frustrating
---
One of the most disappointing things in this interview to me was how hard the Blizz folks hedged on whether or not they'd have any dedicated resources whatsoever for Classic WoW after launch.. and the answer certainly sounded like "no". I'm afraid Classic WoW is going to be a "set it and forget it" kinda project..

Would multiple warriors be a bad idea? The idea of melee plate wearers sounds a lot easier as they take less melee damage and warriors have really high damage don't they? They can also taunt if needed

“I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.”
---
I'm 100% with you there. What I meant is that I have a few friends (5\~) who will probably test out classic, but only me and these two (warlock/war and mage) are somewhat likely to stick around until and at 60.
---
I would have healed you as long as it doesn't compromise my positioning in a way that would make me a good focus-target for the opposing team.
---
As soon as I take damage from their ranged I'll fall back.
---
I shouldn't ever take damage from their warriors as I'll keep my distance to them. It's their rogues who are problematic as I can't see them before they attack me.
---
Whenever I die in AB without the involvement of a stealther, I feel that was an error on my side. An error like trying to heal people who overextend.
---
Classic release matches with my holidays (not on purpose) so I'll play since day 1 but without rushing or forcing me to play to push to 60. The journey is the game for me, and I'll play casually.
---
&gt; discrimination

I think you need a reality check if you think putting a small group in the "other" category rather than one of their own, is discrimination.

---
Lol TBC went overboard. That insane flow chart of attunements kills me every time someone posts it
---
If you follow a guide it's actually only about 100 hrs played to get to 60(slower than fastest speed level btw). So if you play 5 hours a day its only 20 days to get there. Gearing pre raid bis will be another few weeks but you dont need pre raid bis to actually raid mc.

MOP DEMO LOCKS REPRESENT!!! 
---
When I logged on my lock and checked demo out I felt so sad... "Look what they've done to my boy..." I even had the challenge dungeon set; nowadays people would probably call me demon hunter wanna be, but demo locks were superior demon hunters before demon hunters. The class fantasy was better; the gameplay was tight and allowed player creative expression, even the tank glyph was more fun to use than havok (from the extremely limited experience I have with DHs)
---
"Common Core"
---
Ofc there were more than 70 online lol
---
That's an assumption, not a fact.  The developers have only stated that in an ideal sense, they want to remove layering after 2 weeks.  Then, worst case, they'll be in no longer than phase 1.  But I don't even expect them to last more than a month.
---
Layering is put in to avoid release day players of hitting a queue.  Everyone should not hit a queue the first couple weeks.  The only exception is if the realm's maximum layers (as stated in the most recent dev interview) hit a cap, then we'll see queues with layers.
---
So at least there is going to be a limit to layers and not infinite allowed.  Which is probably a good thing.  You don't want to have something like say 10 layers of 3500 players.  That means you're letting 35,000 players log into the server and think that it's not full.  Makes it harder to remove layers.
---
My theory, layers are going to be minimal.  They might have a few layers max, but still put in a server queue so new players will see a queue and decide to make a character on another server and spread out the population.
---
Spoken like someone that's completely ignorant of how long the journey to get these classic servers was.  My bias is palpable?  Your delusion is palpable.
---
Nelf priest ftw. There are going to be so many dwarf priests anyways; lack of fear ward is not going to be a problem. Humans 5% spirit isn't going to be very significant, but a nice little extra. Imo the rep gain is nice as its easier to get different mounts (Saber cat!) Shadowmeld on a pvp server is very useful!
---
So they let us create our characters before launch? Sorry if this is a dumb question.
---
Legion probably had the most class fantasy of any expansion. It was a key design philosophy. No idea how he can say this other than just being against it out of principle.
---
I came from everquest so I used allakhazam during vanilla.
---
Stress test was even more wild, they were pushing people between layers rapidly and doing things to intentionally... well, stress the servers.
---
The way you describe your recruitment there is that players move vertically up the food chain, which is detrimental for guilds. The guild that player leaves then is a player short with attunement the next raid, it was beyond annoying throughout the first patches in TBC. 
---
Nevermind Onyxia/Kara attunements, those are pedestrian and completed blindfolded. 
---
SSC is fair enough: kill Gruul and Nightbane (which can be accessed directly). 
---
TK is annoying due to the SH:H.
---
And then we start with the bullshit Hyjal and BT shit when you are mentally done with TK and SSC, having to explain shit like Al'Ar and Vashj over and over. 
---
The raid parts of the attunements became too much of a bottle neck, has nothing to do with accomplishment because that goes out the window the second you have 30 players online and 22 attuned.
---
grind timbermaw rep in felwood/winterspring and sell the runecloth
---
If you can't see why it's questionable to level a profession and then drop it solely for an item, that is a very minor improvement over a blue dungeon drop, then I can't help you.
---
Do you feel 140 hp, 2 +heal and ~150 mana over a 4min boss fight (assuming you cast often enough to never trigger the 5 second rule) is worth spending ~600g on?
---
Yes, it technically bis, but at some point, you have to draw a line between bis and actual value gained by the investment. I mean for some specs the epic pvp gear is bis until phase 5. Would you advocate every single one of those to farm rank 12+ because of that?
---
Classic+ already exists.  Its retail.
---
I'm taking the first week off although I'll only do that pace you describe for the first 2 days. I'll drop the game time down to about 10-12 hours the remaining 5 days. My goal is level 40 by the end of that week. I hope to hit 60 2 or 3 weeks after that. 
---
I'm hoping this is a more realistic goal while still being fairly focused on 60.
---
Ignoring a player doesn't remove the physical name plate above their character's heads, it doesn't remove it from BG score boards either.
---
Only 6% are exited for barrens chat?  
---
Absolutely disgusting
---
I think this is true. I personally am aiming for rank 14, but I'm sure a lot of others are too. Some of us will not make it.
---
Classic will be  "current WoW" , BFA is to be known as "retail"
---
dam dude you did not need to remove the video, keep doing wat you like
---
It's not. Just saying VC sounds dumb af when the name of the instance is Deadmines.
---
dont repair items unless they are red, wait for upgrades instead
---
If you aren’t minmaxing and joining hardcore guilds, this is the advice to follow. 
---
The meme specs did really well in PvP in a PvE environment if you’re just a casual guild or pick up raider than really whatever you want. 
---
If you’re looking to join top guilds, a lot of us have already done the work and research from Vanilla to Private servers or have experience with one/both, a lot of the “guessing” and theorycrafting has been cracked. 
---
There are some builds although fun, won’t get a lot of spots if any, sadly. 
---
My class fantasy was a Retribution Paladin type from Warcraft 2/3. This was not my experience in the end game. 
---
I re-rolled a few times and also healed most of it when I was a Paladin until TBC. 
---
Do your best, look for builds and guides if you want to get most out of it but Vanilla is a serious grind fest. Do what makes you happy and have fun. Just don’t expect that 39 other people in the raid will understand what you are trying to accomplish. 
---
For those who do raid and want to meme main spec, I suggest you raid lead or GM, to avoid a lot of the shade that’s going to come your way because like Thanos, it’s inevitable. A lot of stereotypes existed and will continue to exist in Vanilla. If you aren’t faint of heart, prove them wrong.
---
I tested the stress of the login screen
---
Honestly I’d rather have it that way. A museum rather than a repeat of TBC, WotLK, so on and so forth. This type of MMO doesn’t exist any more and I think it will be great for it to be playable indefinitely for both nostalgia and for the younger generation that never got the chance. Maybe it will change some people’s desires for what they want in a video game (micro transactions, hand-holding, etc.)?
---
There's a config option in the WoW folder that enables the chinese filtering. It turns the blood from the blood and sparks spray black, so basically everybody is a robot I guess.
---
It’s VC for sure
---
I have friends who think flying was a good addition to the game
---
Holy wait I just remembered Hunters have mana in classic.  
---
BLAST from the past. Better get ready for a lot more of those lol.
---
2 weeks vacation, I'll be cooking some good healthy / easy to heat food (like texas chili or some other stew) and likely have a LAN with some friends
---
Correct, but only if you have an active sub.
---
How is there nothing else to be said they have said NOTHING LOL. Our technology is better now is not an answer for how many realms? how many layers? How many people in those layers? What happens if everyone stays????

---
Thank you for going out of your way to shit on my spec. You have shown you know absolutely nothing of the paladin class.
---
For ret you miss 3% hit, which is a massive loss in both pve and pvp
---
Yes I know the 3% hit is the biggest sacrifice I have to make for that build to exist. I may add that even when I was hit capped on my other ret I still managed to miss and dodge and parry attacks. 
---
for holy you miss the 5% holy crit, which is a big deal, especially in the early phases
---
Can't have everything with this spec. Sure if I'm healing i'll probably have to carry more runes and pots around but at the end of the day who cares? Its my in game money
---
you also miss lasting judgement making you incapable of providing judgment support in raids
---
You mean none of the 20 paladins in my raid can provide judgement support? You mean your raid leader leaves 2 debuff slots open for judgement? How cool is that?
---
you have no improved and no talent blessings meaning the paladin lead has to assign you salv or light to buff, because you can't offer anything else. 
---
You mean the other 20 paladins in my raid wont have any imp blessings?!?!
---
Add to that, that you come into pve as a healer with a suboptimal healing spec and you aren't making many friends.
---
I wouldn't be making friends if I joined a super hardcore balls to the wall min maxing world first chaser guild but i'm not going to because frankly I don't like raiding much but I need gear so I'll join a casual guild or even make my own. So your arguement here makes no sense at all. If I come up to my raid leader and tell him I'm ret but with most of the holy core and a good healing gear he will take me all day every day.
---
The only spec, which has an excuse here is a pve ret, as speccing any improved blessing would be suboptimal for them (and imp might is also the only one they can spec)
---
you only get two out of divine int, divine strength and focus. So, you either sacrifice strength (bad for ret), int (bad for holy and a little for ret) or pushback protection (bad for holy and pvp)
---
True here. But since in raids I won't get attacked spiritual focus is kinda useless and in pvp I can just HoJ OR Rep into a holy light uninterruped. The obvious choice is clearly dumping spirit focus here.
---
and finally for pvp, you are missing the most essential talent: guardians favor. The increased uptime on freedom is essential in most pvp matchups, no matter whether you support somebody else or play on your own.
---
another note: you also have imp sotc, this is pretty pointless unless you raid as ret. The talent isn't very strong (21 spelldmg for 3 points) and most mobs outside of bosses don't last long enough for it to be worth it anyway. You also won't use it in pvp at all.
---
Fights dont usually last long enough for me to cast 2 freedoms so I fail to see your point here.
---
I don't know why people say to not use jotc in pvp, do yall forget that it increases dmg of a seal of command proc almost 2 times over? And that its also boosted by sanc aura?
---
TLDR gatekeeping bitch dude knows jack shit about paladins and tries shitting on a perfectly viable spec that is just a little odd
---
I’ve been running some serious regressions on my masturbation habits. Searching for correlations between day of the week, time of the day, and which particular genre has the most efficient result. Gotta keep my mind right for launch week and every second counts... I’ll let everyone else figure out the leveling routes and copy of their homework.
---
Hi everyone! 
---
I’m looking for a semi casual US-Alliance guild on a PVP server and play in Eastern time. I’d prefer to raid twice a week (Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday) for 3ish hours each night. 
---
My job makes me require a little flexibility every few weeks to be able to show up late to raid (advanced notice will always be given.) I’ll also play weekends but travel for work so don’t want to commit to weekend raiding. 
---
I will be playing warlock. Feel free to shoot me a PM!
---
Thanks!
---
No classic+ for the love of god.
---
I also want TBC. Only thing that I think vanilla did better them TBC was that Vanilla didnt have flying.
---
It is actually in BFA, there's an insane amount of misinformation blatantly running around this whole thread. I just logged in on Retail, went and smacked a mob with my sword, boom a spray of sparks and blood. Also its in the Beta for Classic, it was fixed after this video was made, the OP just did as much research as most people in this thread
---
i think most toxicity will come from players complaining about lack of retail systems in classic and the rest of the community ragging on them
---
Oh I’m cool with no new content. I more meant.. if there are any bugs etc that make it to live, we are just gonna be living with them. No proper population management for the mega servers layering is going to create, no active moderation.. etc
---
Yeah exaclty, when you look for a group or members to Dire Maul, you say what wing. Same thing Applies to SM.  
---
There is no confusion, and if there is its on you.
---
I think the video could have been better and It seems a lot of people seem to agree
---
He's right though. Remember, it's not healthy to deny your issues.
---
I think I probably did use that for an epic mount, running a lower level friend through. It's just been so long, I don't really remember lol
---
Why 15/15 if there are 18 bosses? Sorry I'm new to Classic.
---
It works, you just need to factor the leeway into it.
---
I just think there are other things people (myself included) are looking forward to more.
---
I selected world-pvp, raids, and community interactions (I think that is what the option was). That doesn't mean I'm not interested in RP, and in some sense I think RP kind of falls under community interactions for me. 
---
From my experience RP-PVP servers tend to have more community events and a lot more people willing to participate which is a big factor, at least for me, why I want to play on one. Also I think it is cool to have people appreciate a back story you have thought of for your character and occasionally RP which will likely never happen on a normal PvP server.
---
People did, actually, and its already been fixed. The video is old

[https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/)
---
Like I said. Rogues and Warriors always on top. 
---
Again, what would be the point of even having them if they did lower dps than range, and require more healing? Top guilds would literally only bring range if you were right.
---
Masterful
---
Except TBC was delayed until January 16.
---
Why level alchemy on your main after reaching 60? There is one bop recipe for alchemy and the only other reason are the labs for flasks.
---
Sort of, but...
---
When I first played Vanilla WoW I learned to (really) tank from a mage. I was level 58 and they needed a tank. I didn't want to look like a noob so I did things that were wrong by trying too hard. The mage kind of scolded me and I had to admit I didn't know what I was doing. After that he was super cool and explained every pull to me and that the 60s would pull and what the process would be after that. 
---
In short: admit that you are new, willing to learn, and most people will be MORE THAN HAPPY to help you. Vanilla is very punishing for F ups, so just be careful and if you don't know something, ask.
---
Can't tank or heal which is a big minus for some people.
---
I scheduled 2 weeks off...room is prestine...need to bring up small refrigerator and stock it with a 6 pack of mountain dew for the lawls, fill the rest with water. Have leveling guide on second monitor, have a work out in the morning. Nap in the afternoon with alarm at launch. Hope to play all night + day and plan on resetting my sleep schedule the next day. 12-16 hr days from then on. With periodic breaks of walking around, push ups, jumping jacks, and alternate days of gym time. My wife's cycle is always at the end of the month so I am not a Savage brute so I do not plan on engaging in that extra curricular activity. If she's late...I'll have a bed/couch next to the gaming station... With the pre conceived notion that I'll be the only one gaining "xp" ....other than that... Everything will be as normal as it usually is.
---
That's what I do, but it doesnt stop some random lvl 18 hunter from wanting to join my DM E/W/N runs...
---
he is giving you a hint ... he wants you to be his ally
---
10 days played is reasonable if you’re very slow. 6 days played is more realistic if you’re even remotely trying to be efficient
---
Don't worry, this was already fixed, the video from OP is old
---
I’m gonna make the exact same character as I am in BFA. Troll mage with the same name.
---
Yea I'm really worried that my playing for 2 weeks straight is going to have a negative impact on my wife and son. My plan is to completely ignore them and remove myself from their lives entirely which should be easy considering they don't exist.
---
seems like incel garbage to me
---
I started off as a Rogue when WoW first came out.   I soon traded up and created a Holy Priest which became my main.  I loved healing and helping others.  All of my mains were healers up till the end of WoD.  I had to change to a dps as I was getting burned out.  People constantly standing in stupid no matter what, cause dps charts rule.
---
I will once again take up that mantle as a healer.  This time though I will be going as a Holy Paladin.
---
As a father of 2 kids, 2y and 4y, and wife. I made this plan. At 1st september, kids are going to kindergartens from 8am-4pm and I am already bought ticket to 1 month vacation for my wife to Australia, as she is going to visit her sister. Also Im checked homeoffice for almost whole month.
---
I'll remind you right now because this is already fixed and was working before the beta ended
---
Taking off at 50% health, popping the pally charge or warrior leap to go as fast as possible, out of range or line of sight of the healer and then bitch when you die. Real fun for everyone. I’m gonna start leap of faithing the bastards!
---
But people discuss the phases in pretty much every other thread.  And yeah you're going to get shit for posting 5 month old "news" in basically every sub.
---
Imagine emoting where emoting doesn’t work.
---
&gt; lmost all classes in BfA are the same and simple. They all use Rogue mechanics in that that no matter what they call them (i.e. soulshards) they are essentially combo points.
---
This is so true, I tried every single spec on the PTR (so I could hit 110 fast) and none of them felt like their vanilla versions. Although, I had quite a blast playing Resto Druid on the free-to-play level 20 PvP scene because it is possibly the closest thing to the original. Watching Sodapoppin's Resto techniques with shapeshifting on the Classic Beta actually helped me learn some solid parallel moves in BfA.
---
Yet people bot in BFA just fine.
---
You can fix each of these through lua.
---
Grooooos.... 'smokes a cigarette' "chew is gross" 'caughs'
---
Actually it hasn't gotten this far without it, this was already fixed before the beta ended.
---
&gt; A 5 man frost mage casting blizzard all on one spot, in the middle of an AV chokepoint?
---
So pretty much every AV, but with like 9 mages and 7 warlocks?
---
More realms, less people. Thing I miss about wow is the server community.
---
It was a bug, and it has already been fixed. OP's video is old. In addition this is actually still a thing on Retail
---
That seems to be most mobile sites these days. I can handle janky ads but it's all the forced autoplayed videos that may or may not blast at full volume even though my phone is muted that really drive me nuts.
---
Unless you're a pro, it's gonna take at least 5 days played. Someone who plays 120 hours of a game in 1 week has issues, anyone who does 120 hours of anything in one week has issues, a lot of them.
---
You shouldn't have a problem hitting the hit cap as a tank (especially as a human or orc) and those 2 add as much or more threat than the ony necklace.
---
This bug was already fixed before the beta ended, OP's video is old. And yes they also fixed the flight path animations and combat text :D
---
I can assure you this wasnt forgotten and has been a few posts with almost identical title and questions.
---
180 days for server 1st. Lol
---
I actually did meth back in 2004 lvld real quick. Haven't touched that stuff sense 2006 tho.
---
All I can say is....GiT GuD
---
Login server dont have layers
---
What blows my mind is the people in there 20s going for high warlord.. how can someone in their 20s have that much free time to grind for high warlord.. or how can they be willing to sacrifice their social life / mental stability for it.
---
In vanilla they are, especially on horde side (windfury).
---
Pls no :(
---
As a Tauren Shaman, i find this highly offensive.
---
You know there's no quality beef in there, it's just pureed gnomes.
---
&gt;~~character creation~~ chance to pay blizzard for a game you can't play yet in two weeks!
---
Ftfy
---
I expect to race to 60 and fizzle out around 40. 
---
Then I will reroll another class and level it to 60
---
Because reasons.
---
2 warlocks seems sad, a mage or hunter would be nice for some cc, paladin dps is pretty lame, sorry to say... warrior or rogue maybe?&gt;
---
You're also forgetting the incorrect crit ratios, incorrect armor values, incorrect hit ratios etc used on Pservers, as admitted by Blizzard. I full expect Mages to top nearly every chart.
---
We’re not waiting for classic, it’s waiting for us.
---
That’s what I figured. Is there a reason why they let us create our characters before launch? Sorry I’ve never played an MMO at launch.
---
They were released in 1.12.
---
This has already been fixed, its only still an issue because people do 0 research before making a post with an old video linked as "proof". Flight path animations and combat text have also already been fixed, but I bet we will see posts about those soon
---
Yea well the way it’s looking they are just gona jam as many people as possible onto a few mega servers and layer them out = nothing like vanilla
---
We’ve had a Blizzcon already in 2019?
---
Yes, but only if you want to sub early and waste half a month's sub.
---
Yeah EVE is definitely for method gamers. They’re more in the game than they are in real life.
---
I agree on the social aspect. Seeing expendable ships in the world doesn’t give you that same avatar socialization feeling that 3rd person character mmos do. I think the best thing WoW ever implemented was chat bubbles above characters. It makes other players feel present and real.
---
&gt; You need to be careful how you read into survey results
---
Why I said, "I guess it's just this sub-reddit".  Because this sub reddit is a very small minority of players who are excited about classic, which likely means they have played it. 
---
My doubts come from roughly 70% of the population in the 25-34 age range and there being 71% of those surveyed now that played vanilla.   That 70% of the survey population was 10-19 when WoW came out.  I can see those in their upper teens playing, but kids in elementary/middle school?
---
Sure, today, you've got young kids playing minecraft/fortnite, but video games for younger generations wasn't as main stream as it is today.  Having a younger kid playing video games, let along an MMORPG, was pretty rare.
---
I still think the data is skewed by people playing private servers and considering that as "retail" for the answer.
---
What other profession actually nets your character a benefit of a similar scale though? The only real alternative from tailoring/herb (assuming herb is your gold generation + mats for pots/flasks) is to have engineering/herb. You only would use engi for pvp (phase 2 onwards) or for sapper charges in raids - which primarily becomes a thing in AQ although there are possible uses for them in BWL. Additionally, from 1-60 you get almost all the mats you need to level tailoring, you’d only need to go back for a little bit of wool/mageweave typically, so it’s not even expensive to level the skill.
---
And yes, I do feel the upgrade is worth it because not every single item upgrade will be a massive boost the way upgrading to lionheart helm is for a warrior.
---
If someone is going to be tryharding enough to pop sapper charges in raid as a healer, they really don’t have a reason to be getting truefaith in phase 1.
---
I don't wanna get into this mess but I wanna point out that this bug has already been fixed, the splatter existed on the beta before it ended. In addition, it still exists on Retail
---
create a sub channel for the languages if you really need them ...
---
Joana guide
---
"Having fun"?
---
Eh, some of us already have active subs. I know it's just Blizzard trying to get those early re-subs but I don't care.
---
He didn't redefine any word. He is using daily correct in his explanation that there are activities in classic wow that come with daily cool-downs.  
---
If you are confused, you can google the definition for the word daily, but he didn't do anything you stated he did.
---
Ret Paladin with pre-TBC talents... it was insanely fun. (Also stupid broken) / or the more fun build of pre- WotLK 3.0 with divine storm. Best run I had as a Paladin after Vanilla purgefest.
---
You realize there are tons of videos of people doing this on the beta, right?
---
Playing wow for the first time. S o I should sub sometime next week, and look for the character creation announcement? Anyone know what time it’s at?
---
Level 12 with only finding one pouch thus far... I CANT WAIT :D
---
You have 3 abilities that build holy power on ret paladin (apart from talents), 2 that spend it. 1 spender is single target, the other is aoe. \#playerchoice
---
No matter how you try to frame it, the BfA rotations (which are vastly simplified from Legion) are more involved and complicated than classic. Classic is not a game where you were challenged to do a rotation. The challenging part was knowing what you were even supposed to do and getting the appropriate gear/items to do it. The class rotations are not great in BfA but they are undeniably better than Classic will be. But you don't play Classic to have a difficult or engaging rotation. The point of classes back then was to be simple. You won't even need a WeakAura to play your class in Classic. Not using a WeakAura in BfA is just gimping yourself.
---
Why the @#$&amp; is it not on your head
---
Yeah you’re downvotes say otherwise, if you weren’t a complete fucking moron that would be a sign that maybe you should rethink this a bit and yet....
---
Think of autoshot like melee autoattacks. You'll switch from mob1 to mob2 without any issues. You should shoot whatever target you're on when the 0.5s animation starts.
---
As for the pet issue, I'm not too sure. I'd assume it would cast said ability on your current target, and if it doesn't, you can always just make a macro so it works that way.
---
So now we're talking about the hypothetical future? You're admitting that you were incorrect about what you were saying about pservers? 
---
In any case you might be right for classic. Some things were wrong on pservers. But it might also be the opposite. Melees might do even more damage. Or they could do less and range would also do less. Noone knows right now. What we do know is that mages were not topping the meters on pservers.
---
My best guess is it's like a preorder in a way for Blizzard. They allow you to reserve your characters and they get an early sub. Win Win
---
Oh no terminology from pservers has found its way here how will we ever deal with the moral blight?!?!
---
Or you know they answered what they are willing to answer and ignored or gave vague answers to stuff they didn't want to.  Also why would you expect new information being pressed released through a third party site when the fuck has blizzard ever done this???
---
"LFP" hahaha
---
Sub by Aug 13th
---
Based on our guild applications (alliance), warlocks are the the fourth most popular class behind warriors, mages, and priests. Paladins are going to be in high demand to get 4 in a raid.
---
Refer Classic WoW as just WoW and BfA as shit version of the game.
---
True, might be worth farming mats and having someone else make pots/flasks as needed
---
I ran my 39 rogue twink as combat mace spec.  There are some really good maces around that level that hit really hard.
---
Where you in a cave all this time? :)
---
Holy shit. No way. Link something man, I don't believe it!
---
I did the rank 11 grind twice.  A lot of the people doing the Rank 14 grind didn't have a guild to do PvE raiding in.  So, a lot of those top honor grinders had nothing else to do really.  You didn't need to farm consumables, repair bills, etc.  You also didn't really need gear because a lot of the BG reputation rewards gave you the gear/weapons you needed and as you ranked up you got better gear.  when you PvP'd so you could practically dedicate 100% of your time to PvP.
---
It's unfair to compare current retail to classic in this regard when the single BIGGEST complaint BfA has faced is that the class simplification and pruning went too far and has made nearly every single spec a bore to play, particularly in terms of the reduced rotational complexity. Even in Legion, the prune and lack of complexity was a major complaint, though at least back then there were a handful of specs left that still had some level of challenge to them.
---
Recently, even Ion Hazzikostas has admitted that they've gone too far and know that players are unhappy, and that a class redesign where specs get more abilities and complexity is necessary for the next expansion.
---
Fans of modern WoW almost unanimously agree that the WotLK, Cata and MoP eras were the best in terms of fun specs and rotations, and in particular MoP is often praised, which was by far the expansion with the most complexity for the most specs.
---
Personally I am hyped for classic and it has a ton of merits which I hope and think will breathe new life in the entire MMORPG genre in the common years, BUT you have to separate things like class identity/fantasy with rotational complexity. Classic has great class design through things like having a lot of iconic abilities, great class quests and non-essential abilities, but for almost all the specs the actual rotations, particularly the raid rotations, are extremely simple and boring, and if we see the classic project evolve beyond 1.12 I dearly hope they won't think that keeping specs spamming 1 or 2 buttons is good design.
---
I too have Kanrethad ptsd
---
It was actually fixed before the beta ended. In addition, flight paths were fixed and floating combat text was fixed.
---
Lots of liquor
---
Waaay back in the day we were in Gnomer with a paladin who hadn't trained healing or ressurection yet. That was rough.
---
Up to level 25ish I think you get a pass as long as you aren’t being obnoxious about it because, let’s be honest, if you played a warrior in Vanilla you know that up to about level 30 you have very few threat generating abilities, so the majority of your time is spent switching targets and taunting anyway.
---
Dont go to the weddings finish the project before Monday its simple. Dad said he was planning a family bbq this summer in august I straight up told him do it before the 26th or I won't be there. We have all been waiting years for this or atleast I have been. People will say itll be there when you get back but will it? Your missing the first 2 weekends who know what could happen
---
10/10
---
Shadow Priest is fine, but not desirable for organized BG's. 
---
In PUG BG's they're absolutely fine, maybe one of the best solo classes. In an organized setting they get prioritized and blown up too fast to do very well. 
---
This has been a thing in both vanilla and private servers for a long time. I'm not saying they are explicitly bad, they are just very low priority on the organized BG totem pole.
---
It was actually a group of friends I met in a group for Diremaul:
---
Ronnyx the Nightelf-Priest, Curo the Gnome-Warrior, Crucial the Human-Mage and Dateldor, the Moonkin.
---
I, the Gnome-Mage Mi, joined their guild and we did all sorts of things together. They also had a Resto-Druid called Minyasereg which kinda replaced Ronnyx as our healer.
---
Crucial, Minyasereg and Darteldor still were around for BC. But I got a bit inactive at the end of BC so I lost contact.
---
If any of the people mentioned in my post read it, please let me know! :D
---
&gt;You mean a bunch of children that never played the game.
---
Seeing how you seem completely oblivious to the notion that AoE pulling dungeons is not only viable but efficient for coordinated groups I would venture that the people doing it have probably played the game more than you. I get it, "Retail bad, classic good" mentality and all that but I don't see how other players using game knowledge and spells that exist with in the game is somehow going to ruin your experience.
---
A top parsing crit stacking mage rolling combustion can still top the dps charts but yes you're right warriors and rogues overall did better. 
---
That said it's not hypothetical that Pserver melee were given way too much crit compared to what we'll see in Vanilla/Classic (big changes in glancing blows, armor values and more as well). 
---
THAT said, we know that resistance values on bosses on Pservers were wrong as well, so your right, who knows.
---
Inspirational.
---
I would say a good number never played vanilla and are claiming pirate server experience is the same.
---
The most recent blizzcon was won by an Na team.
---
They might as well have asked them what socks they wear to the office. 
---
What’s the point of an interview with some dumb ass questions like HOW LONG TILL RAG DIES GUYS LAWLLLLL give me a break what a fcking joke
---
You wouldnt wear Truestrike as tank
---
&gt;To have just TBC after Classic is not a option for a lot of people, almost **half**
---
Glad we just pulling figures out of our ass here.
---
You need a Mage/Warrior/Priest for buffs and then a Demon Hunter/Monk for debuffs. Granted they did make scrolls to give you minor versions of them but it's still better to bring the class. You also still regularly want engineers to bres.
---
Yes, it is extremely common to get &lt;2 professions while leveling. Could easily be 10+%. So these people just click something random.
---
It's not useless, but needelessly incredibly noisy.
---
&gt;Also, how are you going to say a sample is biased when it's been collecting data for less than 12 hours?
---
You are conducting a poll, are you seriously asking me how am I estimating a bigger sample's qualities based on a smaller sample of it?
---
Blizzard will draw the line wherever the money stops. After Classic's launch, if there's no demand for BC servers and Blizz can't figure out how to make money off of it, they probably won't be doing BC servers. Same goes for Classic+.
---
 [https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-gonzalez-8349755](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-gonzalez-8349755) here's one more, but I don't know everybody that is working on Classic
---
"nah" - *Marsisamazing10*
---
Loosely, yes.
---
Are you going to vendor leathers or AH? Someone said they don't sell for much on the AH, but vendoring them is good gold early on.
---
and still people insist that retail players will be the best players in classic since classic (PvP) is so much slower... (not talking about top notch players like those from Method or 24/7 streams ofc)... 
---
I did not play retail for a couple of year but what I saw in vids OP seems to be spot on. If you dont want to spam only fireball, well may switch to a tank or healer for a change. Classic gameplay is simplistic but engaging and incredibly rewarding
---
great amv dude
---
alksjdfslk is just a troll name.  I just know they're making a dumb name to have a dumb name.  They're not using their name as an advertising banner for their twitch channel.  I can't tell what twitch channel alksjdfslk is.
---
Having Class leads is essential in Classic. 40 people is a lot to manage. Lots of things to account for, helps shift the burden. The only thing is... with people playing  new or other toons, I wonder if we will see for the first time having different classes lead others. 
---
I did Class lead on a Paladin since I raided early into Vanilla. I have no intention to play a Paladin since I know the limitations and want to experience tanking. I will help all paladins in my guild and on my server but I’ll be maining something else. Should be interesting!
---
168 hours in a week, average time to level 60, 240 hours. No time at all for eating or sleeping, also several extra days needed somehow.
---
Yes. “New to tanking please be patient.” “Let’s clear trash as it’s XP and we’re all levelling anyways.” “Remember healer you need to heal the avatar in between waves” etc. It was like a psychological test to see whether I was talking to bots.
---
&gt; Dead Mines is called Dead Mines. Not fucking "Van'Cleef".
---
Its so stupid when you think about it :P
---
"Hey ya'll tonight after we raided Raggy, we gonna step into C'thun and progress some more"
---
I just commissioned my entire guild of 150 people to spread out throughout all servers and make characters named Thex.
---
I guildie will be tracking your IP and DDOSing you to keep you out of the game.
---
I hated MOP, but they did do a few things correctly. Overall, the core gameplay of Vanilla was the best but some aspects of MOP would have transitioned well.
---
don't even rush, guilds will be clearing in 2nd week
---
A little gnome war in the best guild on the server ninja looted the dark edge of insanity off one of their first few cthun kills.  Word spread quickly and no one would invite him to a guild.  I'm convinced he wanted to quit and this was his way of going out with a bang lol
---
Might leave a small amount on the AH but the majority will just go to the vendor. At the least it should offset food and training costs.
---
Those people are still frothing at the mouth over layering.
---
I like the balls on you, i bet you play ret pally don't ya &lt;3
---
I cant wait to roll my lvl 1 bank alt called Thex
---
And who said blizzard didn't market classic wow?
---
Blame common core, smh my head.
---
Nobody knew the exact numbers.  Surprise, it was a beta test so they were testing it and having any sort of numbers between layers.
---
The + hit is too good.
---
Necklace, 10/10
---
Looks like you are not alone, so don’t worry :D
---
No - the remake of Vanilla in the current engine is called Classic.  
---
The other one is retail
---
Weapon section is bad. You don't actually get any more rage using a slow weap, its the opposite. Slow weapon lets you have bigger heroic strikes so you get more out of your rage when starved.
---
you can't consistently do significant RMT without botting.
---
My vacation ends the week before it launches, but honestly i dont care cuz Classic is gonna be a marathon for me, not a sprint.
---
Really cool site - a question  (and sorry if it's just me that hasn't read the latest updates on the topic). 
---
Some of the items (i.e. animated chain necklace, wild growth shoulders, etc) which were added later in the process of Vanilla WoW, has to my knowledge been speculated about when would be released, but not confirmed. A lot of the MC off-pieces for example, were added later (which is why I guess you are stating them as phase 2) but as a replacement to T2, which won't be in the game.   
---
Are you just going by your best bet, or has there been some updates I'm not aware of, as to when what is added?
---
They were so much better with mana in my opinion.
---
agree with everything but 
---
\&gt;  UBRS Seal of Ascension chain 
---
not running fcking LBRS more than I need to for ony pre, hate that instance.
---
Also would add: learn your class skills you skipped during leveling, some are required for raiding or pvp and finish those class quests that give you spells (e.g. most people skip the Succubus and Felhound quest for warlocks, in level 60 PvP you will want to have those)
---
I keep a bottle of 90% isopropyl alcohol at my desk to wipe my hands off everytime i go to the bathroom (even after washing my hands), eat some thing, pet my kitty...etc. I cannot fucking stand greasy anything! There is nothing better than having clean finger pads on clean keyboard / mouse
---
For a priest it is not, Truefaith  Vestments are bis until Nef. You can always drop it afterwards.
---
As great as these comparisons are. There are way too many people who try to make their case using Classic Beta footage and *not* Vanilla footage. I mean how many times as Blizz or a CM come back and say yeah, this is literally how it was in the game. People just get outraged and jump on the bandwagon way too fast.
---
I'm not saying this footage is wrong, but I can't remember how vanilla wow was. I don't remember the blood, but I'm not going to be convinced by a private server footage. But 2 comments do agree there was green undead blood so it's not random, it's probably how it was.
---
While correct, it still TECHNICALLY *destroys classic*. Who will be playing on Classic servers when Burning Crusade launches? If BC is on the Classic Servers then technically Classic is gone. I think people underestimate how powerful splitting the community in a billion directions is
---
Classic wow is halal
---
a not-afk hunter for the last boss sure as hell helps if gear is bad
---
Youre right buddo. You watch videos of players who will forever outshine you and regurgitate it as “knowledge”. Even though what they do and how they do it would NEVER work for the average player. Very smart, much IQ. Just know, when YOU are sitting there screaming like a lil bitch in disc when you can’t even kill Neff, because you have literally no idea what it’s like in a forty man raid, I’ll be here laughing.  Also, you’re just as much of a random, nobody with zero credibility as myself. I do enjoy it when people project.
---
Rogues with level 1 weapons are still useful, rogues with R14 weapons are a terror.
---
If a rogue gets R14 early they will be absolutely notorious to the other faction on their server and will stay that way for a long time.
---
Aw. Great news then.
---
Yeah I've been wondering what they're on if they think the homogenized gameplay on live is particularly meaningful and complex.
---
Damn man, thought you were talking about wearing body armor. I was thinking, either this dude really gets into it, or plays in a really rough neighborhood.
---
Thought it would be a love teacher sort of thing. Obviously blizzard would have no way to enforce balance. It would just be for your own preference.
---
What I read that, in retail you can buy/sell gold.  You can use that gold to buy WoW Tokens that will give you a month of subscription time that will allow you to play WoW: Classic.
---
I think in context, their discussion of gold farming to sell for tokens (i.e. a monetary value) is OK in the retail version as long as you use non-automatic process to do it.
---
Just as much in WoW: Classic, farming gold will be OK as long as you use non-automated process.  There is no gold &lt;-&gt; token system in WoW: Classic.  While they didn't directly comment on it, in context I see that they don't approve direct selling of gold using third party systems, as it is also a ToS violation.

There's a skip directly to Menethil Harbor graveyard by jumping to your death into Wetlands from walking over a mountain a bit west of Ironforge.
---
Saves you a *ton* of time.
---
You are technically correct, but functionally not.  2 upgrades, one of them BiS, is better than only 1 BiS upgrade.
---
It begins on the 12th / 13th depending on your time zone. If you are North America that *I think* that puts you late in the day on the 12th. Not sure of the exact time.

Yeah that's fair, there are a few bosses with fear mechanics.
---
Yeah, as far as aesthetics go DHs are great! As someone said, "every moment a wow player spends not jumping, is a moment they spend thinking how much this game sucks" and demon hunters take that to a whole new level! 
---
Their Sense ability is one of my favorite additions to the game - it's cool to use &amp; it encourages exploration. 
---
But I'll always hate you guys, Blizzard gutted my precious demo lock because of you ;(
---
Blizzard does their bans in large waves, because although detection has improved the bots have also improved. If they ban super often the botters find ways to circumvent the bans. So they do completely unpredictable large waves. I really wish it was more often, but bots have definitely gone down in BFA from my personal experience
---
Meh, the way in is just a speed run mainly, dropping floors at the end. The instance itself is awesome and winding. I love it
---
The initial influx of players at launch and the inevitable server issues that follow.
---
Warlocks are the #1 duelist in the game and you think soulstones are relevant at all?
---
What do people think of funny names on here?  I was thinking of going the comical route but not sure if people just don't take you seriously at that point.
---
Desperate prayer, panic button saved me more than once in pvp and pve. would trade that in for shadowmeld in a hard beat , cat mounts are something you can farm, plus looks more of an accomplishment when riding as a dorf or human.
---
I doubt any of the p server players would claim its the exact same, but to assume that they're not extremely close to each other would also be a misrepresentation on your end.
---
Every popular streamer is also a big advertisement by just using their name, no?
---
I believe you're right, I think I mixed up Skul with the Scourge Invasion boss - checking again, I also found no indication that Skul was not available in Strath from the beginning. Thanks!
---
The first week of pretty long playing getting to 40 is probably probably a good bet.
---
I was never a fan of orc female casting animations. I like them as hunters, but not as casters.
---
The tooltop doesn't say anything close to that though.  Do you have a source that the atk speed calc is the same in classic?
---
Back in retail Vanilla I remember smashing a 5 LB bucket of red vines over a 2 day WoW marathon. Looking back at my younger self, UGH, I would never do that again. Probably be hard-boiled eggs and some veggies this time around. I'm not trying to die at my keyboard.
---
Ahh thank god, seemed like a huge oversight so short before release, thanks for the update bud!
---
git yur weeb mmo garbage outta mah classic
---
Hey look another pirate server hero with big dreams! Good luck with your practice based on a totally different product that is well known to be seriously wrong.
---
When willdetailed results will be available please?
---
Oh nice, a twitch kid
---
np! Nothing gets my gears grinding more than a popularly upvoted post about something that is incorrect :D
---
And don't forget that that 40 man raid, how many will actually get gear?  It's not like it is now where you are almost guaranteed a few drops from raids.  Unfortunately that is how it is these days.
---
What are you even talking about? Get enough speed? There’s no haste in Vanilla.
---
Yah i did my research on R14, don't think i'll have the time to get to that point sadly.
---
I miss websites. I don't use discord because some of the investors that are involved with it, and everyone puts everything in discord nowadays.

You can be dagger. Combat dagger is on par with combat sword. But he’s talking about a prep build. You will do a lot let damage as a prep build than as a a combat build.
---
Really you should edit your name out dude, some troll will grab that in 0.001 seconds
---
Perfect for eating dinner or autorun while gathering stregth to continue.
---
The way I see it, they'll keep pumping out classic servers for all expansions and "lock" those into an era.
---
So eventually, we'll have Classic, TBC, Wrath, Cata, Mists, WoD, Legion, BFA, etc.  We can choose what era we want to keep our characters in while the main retail version goes on.  I'd almost think that eventually these classic servers would dwindle down to less than a handful available world wide.
---
The larger issue with classic was finding data for the clients.  I'm sure as time has gone on, Blizzard has done a lot better job archiving all of their information and database structures.
---
If they could basically take the 1.12 data, reorganize it and plop it into the modern architecture, they can likely do the same for all past expansions and those that match the database structure will be even easier to convert.
---
I forgot to point out I was talking about dungeons.  I can't even make it to raiding because the game just feels so empty for me, but the high end stuff does seem like a lot of fun due to the complicated mechanics and a lot more fun than raid tanking in classic.
---
Not sure how well it will translate to the actual server population though. For example I think Hunters will be more popular than indicated on this poll due to the more casual players tendencies. I very much doubt they're going to be less popular than druids as the poll shows.
---
We'll see about locks. I guess I have my guild spot already so not too bothered.
---
You don't have to run from the NE POV either you swim along the coast north of the dock until you are in Loch Modan then you drown yourself and you rez in Kharanos.
---
Oh dear, you really are embarassing yourself.
---
First, it's not 'your spec', it's an ancient spec and it's common knowledge, that it's really bad.
---
&gt; Can't have everything with this spec. Sure if I'm healing i'll probably have to carry more runes and pots around but at the end of the day who cares? Its my in game money
---
Yes, 5% holy crit is an acceptable sacrifice, but not for 31 points in ret.
---
&gt; You mean none of the 20 paladins in my raid can provide judgement support? You mean your raid leader leaves 2 debuff slots open for judgement? How cool is that?
---
Sure, 20 paladins in the raid. And yes, the raid leader should provide 1-2 slots for judgements, jow and jol are insanely good debuffs. If you don't know that, then you have no right telling me I know nothing about the class.
---
&gt; You mean the other 20 paladins in my raid wont have any imp blessings?!?!
---
Yet again with the 20 paladins in the raid. Why are you special? What if the others also all choose specs, which don't have imp blessings?
---
&gt; I wouldn't be making friends if I joined a super hardcore balls to the wall min maxing world first chaser guild but i'm not going to because frankly I don't like raiding much but I need gear so I'll join a casual guild or even make my own. So your arguement here makes no sense at all. If I come up to my raid leader and tell him I'm ret but with most of the holy core and a good healing gear he will take me all day every day.
---
Sure, but don't you think it will be frowned upon, that others sacrifice their talent points to improve blessings and provide jow and jol, while you pick a selfish spec, which fulfills the bare minimum requirements for a raid healer paladin just so you can go deep ret? If you can find a guild, whose paladins don't care about that, fine. But there is certainly a potential for arguments here.
---
&gt; True here. But since in raids I won't get attacked spiritual focus is kinda useless and in pvp I can just HoJ OR Rep into a holy light uninterruped. The obvious choice is clearly dumping spirit focus here.
---
Of course, because being able to heal once or twice a minute (pending resist, trinket etc.) is a good plan. Focus is very important in pvp. Shows how much you know about pvp.
---
&gt; Fights dont usually last long enough for me to cast 2 freedoms so I fail to see your point here.
---
Umm, what? Guardians favor increases duration of freedom, not reduce cooldown. It's ridiculous, how you call me out for knowing nothing about paladins for criticizing your spec, when you don't even know what the talent does. Guardians favor increases freedom duration to 16 sec, so 80% uptime instead of 50%. It's a must have for pvp and this is something every experienced paladin will tell you. Also fights don't last long enough? What? You play the class with the highest survivability. Of course fights will last longer than 20sec. And we won't be in naxx gear oneshot territory for quite a while. 
---
&gt; I don't know why people say to not use jotc in pvp, do yall forget that it increases dmg of a seal of command proc almost 2 times over? And that its also boosted by sanc aura?
---
Um, what? Jotc doesn't scale with sanc aura or vengeance. It's applied after all modifiers. And imp jotc is 161 holy dmg. That's 48 dmg per soc-proc, flat, unimproved it's 41. If you judged soc right out, it would have dealt around 200 dmg non crit with no spelldmg on gear and no stun on the enemy. So, you'd need 4-5 soc-procs to even reach parity. This would skew further and further towards directly damaging an opponent the more spellpower you get on your gear. Not to mention how hard it is to keep a judgement debuff up on the enemy in pvp.
---
I believe it is common to not level professions but I not believe it’s common to not grab any at all - there is literally no reason not to.
---
I have an easy stew recipe you may enjoy. I call it Enhanced Dinty Moore: 2 lbs lean ground beef, 4 large onions, 2 cans sliced carrots, 1 can diced potatos, 2 Large cans Dinty Moore Beef stew (available at walmart). Brown the beef in a big, big, big ass stew pot, do not drain. Add chopped onions and some garlic powder (no salt! the canned stew has plenty) and stir until onions start to turn clear. Add both cans Dinty Moore. Drain and add carrots and potatos. Turn heat to low and stir occasionally for like an hour or two. Serve with buttered bread or whatever. Makes like 12 meals for $2 each
---
Unfortunately this isn't really something that can be debated, TBC absolutely chipped away at the classic design philosophy of WoW.
---
You brought up class balancing but I'm not sure what it has to do with this discussion. Sure, it's one of the things that TBC improved upon, although there are some specifics that I disagree with like turning shamans into a dual wield dps class instead of keeping their two handed flavor.
---
Now as far saying that TBC improved PvE, 5 mans, and PvP - I'm not sure how any fan of classic MMOs could believe this. I guess I'll quickly run through the features of the expansion, if you've somehow forgotten them.
---
*PvE*: 
---
* Azeroth and the entire 1-60 experience were essentially removed to the game, to rush players straight to Outland. Huge mistake that's continued to this day. Why not keep 1-60 relevant and expand upon the original game world?
---
* Related, much of the game's original flavor was removed. Instead of 6 different capital cities to hang out in, all with their own unique culture, your options are Shattrath.
---
* Many interesting aspects of the game were removed to make things easier for the players. For example, the alchemy lab which is now easily accessible by anyone in Shattrath.
---
* Flying mounts cheapen travel and the sense of adventure in the game.
---
* Introduction of daily quests, one of the laziest design decisions in the history of MMOs. Keep doing the same easy thing once every day to earn virtual currency that you can trade in for welfare gear. Awful.
---
**5 Mans:**
---
* I'm not sure how you can look at a dungeon like Blackrock Depths and say yeah, TBC's were better. TBC totally removed the wow factor that classic dungeons had and replaced that with places that you speedrun to obtain gear and then forget about. To facilitate this, the layouts were reduced to hallway with trash, room with boss, hallway with trash, room with boss, repeat. Exploration was replaced with tedium. And multiple difficulty levels make no sense either.
---
&gt;pvp system got better
---
* The introduction of Resilience to split gear between PvE and PvP was bad design, and against the design philosophy of classic.
---
* Flying mounts significantly hampered world PvP.
---
I'm not going to get into every detail of the expansion but I don't think that's necessary anyways. 
---
You can say that you prefer TBC. That's fine, it's an opinion and I can't argue against that. But to argue that TBC *didn't* take a hard turn away from the original design philosophy of classic WoW and classic MMOs in general is just being ignorant of the facts.

Spending hundreds of gold for an extra +5 healing is not that worth, especially not for a new player.

There’s a shortcut for Night Elves.  You can swim along the coast to Dun Morogh and then drown yourself and end up in the cold ridge valley grave yard.

It's already all over this thread anyway. I'm not worried about it. First they have to choose the same realm as me. Then they have to reserve it before I do.
---
If someone really wants to go out of their way to "troll" me, then all power to them. I'll just pick another name.

[Perhaps you should get your hearing checked.](https://i.imgur.com/v0DeEjB.png)

Classic is based on the 1.12 database as it was in 2006. Class balance is 2006 class balance. Any graphics that are determined by the database files are also 1.12. Exceptions being shadows and water, presumably these are part of the graphics engine and would appear regardless of which database they used.
---
Woosh
---
If anything, I'd rather have them come out with WoW 2.  But I think they're already past the point of doing that.  Cataclysm was a perfect scenario to reshape the world, start everyone over at level 1, wipe the world/economy/progress and have a new game with a reshaped land.  
---
At that point they could have level squished back to 60 max, used cata as the new world, put in some classic raid content that "survived the cataclysm" as well.
---
Im not talking about retail or classic, I'm talking about the removal from vanilla.
---
Like it’s been said, any prep build is largely inferior (like 50% less) compared to a combat spec due to not having AR and Flurry. 
---
You can slightly mitigate that by having cold blood and improved SnD. But you’ll still won’t be close to the pve specs, sadly. 
---
Now depending on your guild, it might not be a problem once the raids are on farm. Otherwise, gotta respec :(
---
You should get trinket so you can fully reject the private server meta and show your guild what a great tank you are. 
---
I love how you ignore parry haste calculating mark proc chance but then say it will kill a DW tank. Do math instead of just making stupid claims you cant support.
---
While it would be nice to "reset" WoW progression with a classic+, I don't think it will happen. 
---
I'd rather they just start over with a WoW2.0, but even that will have influences from retail wow.
---
Uh, my dad works for microsoft, ur gonna get arrested, bud.

They’ve been “nerfed” by fifteen years of knowledge and skill creep.  Today’s group of forty idiots is a lot better than the forty idiots of yesteryear.
---
Raids are a logistical challenge and a social experience.  Outside of four to five fights, none should be a real challenge in terms of mechanics or reaction time.
---
After Diablo III's launch I have zero faith in them actually making a close guess this time. If they underestimated one of the most anticipated PC games of all time it's very likely they'll underestimate Classic.
---
The less you have to manage the easier (until you really get all the key bindings down). It may be easier to start with similar classes like warrior and paladin so you have tank and heals and they will hopefully stay in the same range
---
I'm pretty sure given the tone of the rest of it, it wasn't a mistake.
---
Offhand is amazing. Mh not so much. But they look sick!

It was half guild/half PUG, and they were all players that were familiar with each other and all were on Ventrilo. It was a Blizzard EU server, though I've no idea what server it was since I and my friend played on Aerie Peak but his brother rolled a different server. If I did know his server or char name I'd probably be able to find an old thread with people discussing the drama because it caused quitr a shitstorm when it happened. 
---
Maybe you should stop and ask yourself why a random user would come to the Vanilla WoW subreddit fabricate a story about their friend's dick brother ninja'ing Corrupted Ashbringer. What do I have to gain from lying about that.
---
Do you have a source for that? Not arguing, just curious where you got that statistic.

 Google Forms is limited and I would be unable to add one option of “no professions” I would have to add two which I believe would cause more issues than the small portion of players that aren’t going to pick up any professions in the months that it takes them to get to 60.
---
I had a twink shammy named "healmytotem" if you need an idea.  My guild at least liked it.

Mmm, maybe make a more prominent apology on this thread (maybe so it's visible at the top), and that should fix it. I think Oeanic people will be realistic about the (non-)practicalities of redoing the survey, while appreciating your honest apology. Good on you for owning up to this and wanting to address it properly. No big deal, I'd just suggest to apologize. Cheers.

Horde as usual.  I've tried alliance a time or two but I lose interest fast.  Don't care for the races outside of Dwarves, and their leaders are mostly boring imo.  Horde has always kept me interested.
---
Fuck the guide. It's dumb af to refer to instances by an abbreviation of the last boss name. You don't call Gnomeregan 'MT' (Mekgineer Thermaplugg) or Sunken Temple 'SoE' (Shade of Eranikus), so why would you call Deadmines 'VC' ? Literally no other instance in WoW does that shit. This whole "VC" thing was, and is, nothing more than some Alliance idiots being stupid.
---
In 2004 they had zero information on server loads, player expectations, how do people log in on a launch day vs patch day vs prime time. 
---
We're talking 15 years of data on server popularity trends.  It's a whole hour long video if you're interested in watching the whole thing, but Chris Wilson of Grinding Gear Games was talking in detail how they predict server loads based when they start leagues and put out new patches for Path of Exile.  Basically, they have a trend of population spikes but they could get a good estimate based on website traffic prior to the patches/expansions going live.  
---
As I said, Blizzard has 15 years of this data to pull from to make more accurate predictions.
---
Its a classic dwarven recipe for better male endurance
---
It’s funny Bc vanilla added things to give you time to do things for urself like eat while going on long walks. Plan accordingly my fellow nerds
---
I guess the most important thing here is that Classic is already solved.  Like writing out an APL is as simple as copying someone else’s work with proper syntax.  Although I’m sure people that love doing it will also be creating ones with non-cookie cutter specs which, again, is pretty simple math. 
---
Creating all the spells and effects is completely separate from making the APL.  Yes, that can be a painstaking process. 
---
As for threat - that has never and will never have any effect on the APLs - all damage sims are meant for one thing: DPS.  
---
Mana efficiency is also never even considered.  It could be, if someone was able to figure out another way, but one would think that just nuking while chugging mana consumes until oom &gt; waiting for mana (enough to finish the fight) &gt; continuing rotation is probably as optimal as it gets.
---
Unless you are rolling with a coordinate group I don't even think rank 10 is possible.  Many people on here say rank 10 is "easy to do casually" but from what I can tell that isn't true.  My goal is to just hit rank 8 since 9 doesn't give any gear.
---
For advertisement..... You don't seem to understand how marketing works.
---
Autoshot CD will persist among mobs. You can get a swing timer, keep mob 2 on you and mob 1 on your pet in shooting range. In that waiting period for auto shot you can fit in some wing clips or auto attacks on mob 2
---
That's something ArcheAge did good. Non-instanced world bosses that spawn at specifc Times. Massive 200 vs 200 battles were going on to save the kill for one faction.
---
It's being posted on the WoW Boards as well as tweeted out by many streamers. We are trying to be as all encompassing as possible, but at the end of the day it's still meant as a fun discussion tool, not the Holy Bible of information.
---
Paladins can't get their epic mounts in phase 1 right?
---
That's what I gathered from that interview.  They can't have unlimited layers.  Servers like Mal'Ganis were a clusterfuck in vanilla and our entire guild actually re-rolled on Burning Legion because the high population ended up crashing the server for a week.
---
You can't give the appearance to 10k+ players that the server has zero queue and isn't overloaded.  You have to put in queues at some point so new players don't flood the server even more.
---
&gt; If you're not working on your cardio so you can effectively Naruto run to the bathroom during trash pulls in BRD, you're a casual.
---
Imagine not using a piss bottle and calling others casual.
---
For advertisement?! You mean the game they are not advertising in the slightest?! Lol nahhhhh duddddd nahhhh
---
No, I'm quite aware of how Classic came to be. I'm also aware that ultimately, post-Naxx, folks will inevitably find themselves in at least 1 of 3 camps. NoChanges, TBC or Classic+.
---
And if Blizzard is smart, they'll find a way to appease at least two of those camps. NoChanges + TBC or Classic+.
---
Allow players to copy their characters to the alternate version of the game, and the rest can stick with NoChanges.
---
Good old Mc Chew and spew gets it.

Learning your crafts organically as you develop your character was the way professions were designed to be done, just as you're planning.

Did you watch Joanas full speedrun even once? The guy was good back then, but compared to todays standards he is insanely bad. And even he himself thinks he can beat bis own record by a multitude of hours or even a full day. And he is terrible at the game nowadays.
---
Classic was way more forgiving than modern raiding, at least at the high end.  Mythic raiding usually has at least one mechanic per fight where one mistake from one person wipes everyone.  The dps requirements usually mean a few deaths is a wipe to enrage.
---
This isn’t a knock against Classic, a lot of my friends are looking forward to a more laid back raiding experience.
---
Maybe you should watch some videos of vanilla raids and come back and tell us how hard it looks while they mostly push one button, just compare what players have to do in a fight now vs vanilla and it's easy to see what raids are considered harder now.
---
Btw killed Neff just fine, I know people that clicked every spell and killed upto 4 horsemen, I know them because I raided with them, even with the smaller raid size in TBC we still managed just fine to clear everything with people like that in the raid.
---
My credibility doesn't matter, that is why I mention Sco, he is someone well known and he doesn't share your view on the difficulty of raids.

Guild is going alliance 
---
still feels weird to me
---
6/10 pasta.
---
Oh I know. I have full faith in the classic community to be good folk. That's why we're all here anyway. Community right? Besides, my name choice is pretty lame anyway haha.
---
Normal is the difficulty for leveling dungeon. M0 is the default difficulty. Its literally in the name. M Zero
---
Also important to note those quest chains wont be in the game at launch until diremaul comes out.
---
It's just going to be Vanilla.
---
The Classic WoW is everywhere, it is all around us, even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes.
---
As a warlock you want tailoring. Let me introduce you to our lord and saviour The Bloodvine Set
---
Itotemblowme
---
So many small details like this missing makes a huge difference. It really bothers me, what else am I missing. They added turning torsos atleast
---
I am in the same boat as you (priest, limited time, not sure about professions). My first plan was to do herb/taloring, then switch to alchemy after getting the robes.
---
But after seeing the drop rates from the two bosses I think I will skip the taloring/robes.
---
If the database I checked is correct, it is 2% of one boss and 1% of the other. Hell no I’m grinding for that with limited time.
---
Then if it drops for me, I might consider unlearning alchemy if I haven’t learned anything rare yet, but don’t know if thats stupid..
---
Great profesions guide tho :D
---
Were you talking to me?
---
No, my son is also named Thex.
---
True, but they had a totem on all their shaman, if you went to the alliance side without dwarf priest you didn't have anything to help the tanks, right?
---
Rip 40min of your life.
---
Happens to the best of us.
---
I didn't ask because I wanted to criticise. 
---
Like I said, it's a serious question. It could be that he has a valid reason. If so, I am curious what it is.
---
No, it's actually the opposite. People here never actually played Vanilla and will probably never see Naxxramas. Just look at the posts and comments on "Can you dungeon with this spec?" etc. And I will probably get downvoted by haters who use every chance they get to shit on private servers.
---
Sure man, enjoy the fame that you are certain to get through your totally reasonable achievement! Or perhaps you are bad and should feel bad.
---
My goal is to hit 60 with my main by New Year's Day, lol.
---
Yeah, I also expect to see many tourists roll hunters. They will leave past 30-40.
---
I will roll hunter myself, so the less hunters, the better for me, but I wouldnt be surprised if it's third most played class after launch, behind warriors &amp; mages.
---
Wow this is the most toxic post ive read in weeks, does not matter how you play the game, everyone is entitled to enjoy Classic in their own way. Ill group with any casual before ever inviting a person like you.  
---
I hope your name is stabinback or dotsonyou. or something stupid so we can spot you.
---
trying way too hard with your contrarian karmafarming post. sarcasm works terribly on the internet and in written form.
---
Muslims that cares about meat being halal would not order that anyways.
---
Ok, will check it.  Thanks.
---
I don't think they did.  It sounds like there will be layering to a point and then they start putting a queue up.  
---
Layers are there to avoid initial server rush and prime time during the first couple weeks.  
---
My guess, let's say the limit is 3 layers per server.  If it's 3500 people per layer, that's 10,500 until you hit a queue.  After week 1 they reduce it down to 2 layers and monitor the queue times.  If queues are insane outside of prime time, they start putting in free server transfers to lower population servers.  This will remove a lot of the casuals off the server.
---
Week 2, likely see the same thing.  Remove layers, so there is only 1 layer.  Queues will be there, offer transfers to new/low pop servers.
---
I disagree.
---
I made a list for myself of all the mats I'll need and which zones provide them. I have everything from which zone is best for (x) mining node, to which zone I'll need to grind skinning in, to which mobs are best to farm for cloth/meat drops.
---
Honestly, the only difficult part for or you will be enchanting. I honestly dont think anyone should level it on the way to 60 as you need so many greens.
---
We should refer to classic as WoW and BFA as "that other thing"
---
What I learned is there are a lot of people like me lol
---
These are probably highly sought after information and is kept secret from most people just a warning.
---
eh, I like it. memorable and short. good choice :)
---
Destiny 2. It seems to be heading in a great direction with forsaken, and especially with Bungie being free from Activision.   
---
Fun little fact. Luke Smith, the creative director for D2, was a Tauren Shaman Scarab Lord, and he seems to still have a lot of passion for games and the rpg aspect that helped shape him as a gamer. His email signature apparently still has "Scarab Lord"
---
I know this may seem crazy, but not everyone is sitting on reddit obsessing over every little detail. They simply tune in here and there and read what they find officially.
---
I agree. Which is why I think having classic, classic+, classic tbc, etc all at the same time is a bad idea.
---
I think the most likely option is Blizzard says X date is when TBC opens and all characters are 1 time copied (this avoids gold duplication etc) and you can choose to play the classic tbc expansion or chill on vanilla.
---
Given that MMORPGs are by nature carrot on stick driven, that is people need something to look forward to, more people than not will probably move to TBC.
---
There has never been a private server that stuck itself at naxx forever and had more than a few hundred people online at any given time.
---
What people dont understand or seem to miss is that private vanilla servers have been popular for several years because they keep releasing new ones. People do not and will not stay on a server or project where the next step is to do nothing.
---
I tested it on the stress test and it worked.
---
BC if I recall.
---
My head is shaking it is head.
---
Logged into my account recently after years and found all my characters lol.
---
The names ‘safeblud’  and ‘fatzoot’ are names I kind of want to use for alts again haha
---
You made that number up right here on the spot. Let‘s not pretend otherwise.
---
I don't expect any karma from this - just some entertainment.
---
Not poop socking, what a world

* World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth -&gt; Retail
---
* World of Warcraft: Classic -&gt; Classic
---
Here's my strategy (also playing a priest).  Line 4 is tentative, but I think it's the direction I'll end up going.  Might hold on to tailoring for a little while to make bags for gold depending on where I'm at.
---
1) Start Tailoring (Georgio Bolero, Mage Quarter) &amp; Enchanting (Lucan Cordell, Canals near Mage Quarter)
---
	
---
2) Drop Enchant after Greater Magic Wand, start Mining (Gelman Stonehand, Dwarven District)
---
3) Drop Tailoring for Engineering after Truefaith Vestments, start Engineering
---
4) Drop mining once it's not needed to level engineering, pick up skinning/herb for gold potential.
---
McDonald's is definitely not halal
---
If no one refers to classic as retail then it works doesn’t it. No one cares if it’s actually technically a retail gane.
---
Close enough is subjective. Was it fun? Sure. But it did not replicate the experience, and things went downhill fast when the megaservers became popular. Fastest way to not be like vanilla is to stuff 4 times the population cap into one server.
---
Skruf, general and I have 10 satchels of Gøteborg rape.
---
Ppl seem to forget that the players that did sm on the beta should be regarded as twink characters. You will not be as geared as they were when you are doing it. (Not saying it isn’t easier than private servers, even with normal geared characters, but their gear does make a difference. It will, as an example, not be normal for warriors to have ww axe at level 30, but everyone in classic beta did because of the level 30 cap).

Might be interested in the more hardcore of the two groups. Would be playing as a Mage, and bringing over upwards of a handful of folks who would play more casually (and might be interested in the casual Sunday raid).
---
At work, but can hit up the discord possibly tonight.
---
Avoiding Onyxia's fear is impractical, if not impossible.
---
I assumed it was custom tailored to single target speed leveling.  Like, when I level, I enjoy running dungeons and gearing up along the way.  In Classic however, I want to avoid as much wpvp shenanigan as I can, so I'm all about 60 as quickly as possible, and so I'm going to leave out dungeons all together.
---
I'm figuring 6 days played to 60 (dungeon spell cleave grinding with premade) which seems reasonable.  At 16hrs/day that's just 9 days, and I have 7 off. So 60 within 14 days seems very reasonable.
---
Thats a decent sample size too.  Nice.  Balance FTW.
---
Trump

Discounted due to water damage
---
The way I see it.  Dead Mines was DM in vanilla at release.  We never had Dire Maul.  People were more likely to call it out for Dead Mines or DM when LFG as they leveld up. 
---
Once Dire Maul came out, that became DM as well.  But you would know it as DM East/West/Full or Dead Mines was simply typed out full.

# ⚡  OCEANIC - LATE NIGHT RAIDING ⚡
---
📋 **Guild:** &lt;Dominatus&gt; \[OCEANIC\] \[HORDE\] \[PVP\]
---
🌅 **Time Zone**: GMT+10
---
⌚ **Raid times**:  10:00pm - 1:30am Mon/Weds/Thurs (+ Sunday as a reserve night if needed)
---
📋 **Goals**: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
🎲 **Loot**: Loot Council
---
☎ **Contact**: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)
---
🔎 **Info**: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA/SEA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players.
---
📥 **Applicants**:  Applicants: Vanilla raiding experience is preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear, raid attendence etc).

 **US, PvP, Alliance, Semi-Hardcore, PST, Morning raid times**
---
**Main:** Human / Warrior / Fury (Open to gearing up in order to function as an OT)
---
Will have rogue and mage alts for money making.
---
Planning on no-lifeing for the first 1.5-2 weeks with family members who are also playing. The plan is to be 60, attuned, and farming BIS in that first 2 weeks.
---
Will probably play 20-30hours/week easy.
---
I want to focus on clearing content. No aspirations for world first or anything like that, just want consistent focus on progression and having fun with like minded people.
---
My current work schedule(2nd shift with possible extra time added to the end of shift) requires me to raid mornings in order to guarantee raid attendance. Anything from 4am-11am PST should work fine for me.
---
Would prefer EPGP + loot council for transparency. This worked for my guild back in TBC--but I am open to other options if they are better.
---
**Background**
---
Played Vanilla in 2005 as a rogue. Raided in TBC on the same rogue and a druid (heals then tank). Nothing special, but I am familiar with the game and with a few of the classes. I will be progressing much more quickly this time around. I played up until Wrath and was done when the game began going in a direction I did not care for. Looking forward to going back to Classic times. I am also looking forward to trying something new class-wise (Warrior).
---
People do jed runs, join a nice guild and spam run
---
Usually w during fighting but always auto run whenever possible outside combat
---
U want sum Thex?
---
Here's an idea: Let's start a petition for Wowhead to adopt the Thottbot design on their classic subpage.
---
I responded back on Bnet
---
I'm a little confused, we're talking about the blood and sparks yea? I didn't know it was removed from vanilla before returning later
---
At least there are better account security options these days. Set up 2FA on your account and you pretty effectively stop all attempts at other people getting access to your account.
---
Especially if the launch is delayed.........
---
Remember back when the youtubers released beta information?
---
I always go through the South Gate pass so I can do the quests there too.
---
Yeah, when I was fifteen, I come from the store to start my journey as a mystical undead!... And then realised all my friends start playing humans, dwarf and fuzzy gnomes, lol.
---
I feel your pain.
---
People like to play differently. I have been a competetive gamer for as long as I've lived basically, I usually dont sleep until I hit max level in every expansion so far in WoW. With vanilla I will probably hit 60 in week 2, because I only have 1 week of work, but I bet I will play 18 hours a day for 6-7 days to maybe hit 60, but most likely not. Some people just prefer having fun by not wasting time :'D. We like to be efficient with our precious time. Nothing sounds more insane to me than "walking around mining at lvl 12 because I need to make this belt for lvl 13" or something like that, that just sounds insane and you could be lvl 18 in the time you farmed for that belt on lvl 12, lul.
---
I could really use a scrunchy...yeah you heard me.
---
To be fair, your point about it being the best you can get is a decent part of the conversation. Another over-utilized and seemingly under-researched piece of WoW Classic Gospel, wowclassicbis.com, has Demon’s Blood in its pre raid protection warrior BIS. I would use Mark over Demon’s Blood, 100%.
---
There’s probably an argument that if you’re completely mitigation focused in pre-raid to take Force of Will and Mark, but you’re better overall using at least 1 threat trinket (HOJ, Blackhand’s Breadth, even Rune of the Guard Captain early on).
---
My first Main char rogue was Brienner from Brienne (got). No idea why :(
---
Even walking on the paths towards Menethil Harbor my dumb ass still managed to die from mobs.
---
k
---
I hope you seriously consider whether this world needs you taking up its air.
---
You are correct but they did try for xmas and missed.
---
No one is going to write an article like this specifically targeted at people refreshing /r/classicwow all day long.
---
It’s a nice name, rolling rogue again?
---
&gt;New "Classic" content would be neat, but any option where the player  can move on, or stay put is going to split the player base.
---
This is completely irrelevant. The playerbase would at that point already be split between those happy to stay with classic, and those bored with it. Those who are bored will move on to other things eventually. There won't be a playerbase to split, since at that point a Classic+ or TBC realm will only draw the players who don't want strictly vanilla. 
---
We faced a similar situation on a private server I played on years ago, a TBC server. Most of us argued for and wanted a WotLK realm, the TBC die-hards vehemently refused saying it would "split the playerbase". I pointed out to them that it wouldn't matter eventually since people would just leave to other servers that had WotLK. Lo and behold, a long time passed and people left the server in droves because they got bored with being stuck on TBC for years and years, a die-hard community remained, they then introduced a WotLK realm, and lots of people who had left returned.
---
PIMP THE ORC FURY WARRIOR LOKTAR OGAR
---
Good luck to them with how popular the authenticator is now. Aint no getting into those accounts with them on.
---
res is still pointless if you play solo, healing too if you don't mind wasting bandages or a prot paladin
---
If you are leveling a warrior with your wife, you might want a solo character for when she's not around so you don't pull ahead. Same for her also
---
Nice one!
---
Level 12 and still no charge in sight
---
Yep, dis definitely 2005
---
microsoft arresting people these days?
---
&gt;I experimented with it during the last stress test, some options appeared to be static values that were automatically reset by the client as soon as you started up the application
---
make the file "read only"?
---
I agree that for a more casual player the robes aren’t that important to obtain. I simply don’t find the robes to be that expensive (unless you’re straight up buying all the mooncloth off the AH) as you tend to make quite a bit of gold doing strat live runs for the recipe, which ends up paying for the robes or can be put towards your epic mount.
---
Well I hope people digging 24h hours topic to insult people having a civil discussion are nowhere near classic.
---
Nah even if you look at rfc, dm, wc everything is much easier than what ppl are used to. 60 stuff will likely be harder but the low lvl stuff is super easy compared to pservers or early vanilla
---
You will not have as good gear as they did, because you will not be stuck at level 30 for 2 weeks to twink out your character and have engineering leveled that high.
---
So is it ONLY on that day? Or can I make a character 2 days before launch?
---
/r/theyknew
---
Glider was the reason I made a paypal account back in the day. Funny thing was, it took like 3-4 days to activate my account, right in that timespan a huge banwave hit. Still bought it and was never banned.
---
That's pretty much every game that has ever released. Everyone has some grandiose plans on what they want to do and either get burnt out or bored before their plans are fully realized. If that's unpopular then so is drinking liquids.
---
Don't chase Druids into the water!
---
Im for classic+ also but i want to point out that power creep was a problem in classic wow. By the time we got naxx it was pushing item lvl 90 with t3 gear.
---
Doesn’t matter. You’re gonna fall behind in the guide. You need to kill literally every mob you see that’s green in order to keep up. Most people won’t do that.
---
His argument was that Blizzard as a company doesn't have the talent anymore. They've brain-drained so hard that they can't make any Classic+ content that wouldn't be shit.
---
And if they decide not to have a NoChanges realm and instead just do Classic+, if they fuck up the +part, we're shit out of luck.
---
Oh god. I need to decide which three alts to reserve.

---
You also made the assumption that parry haste will somehow one shot only dual wielding tanks lmao.
---
good eyes. you will make a good hunter.
---
ive come to terms with it, the general consensus of the guild is that pallies are better suited for our goals than shammys 
---
therefore we are going alliance
---
I want you to understand something. I work in a prison as a Correctional Officer, 50 to 75% of the people I work with suffer from some form of antisocial personality disorder. Ive been trained to look for and spot it. It is a spectrum, people have it degrees. And every single person defending this (and to a lesser extent, griefing in general) are basically ticking the checklist straight down.
---
Taking joy in another suffering and dehumanizing others to justify your actions.That is what is happening here, that is what you are trying to not only defend but somehow even claim a moral high ground. You have no high ground and you have no morals. You not being able to understand that people where grieving the death of another person does not make them "too sheltered", it makes you a bad person.
---
Well, it's jsut a matter of getting your story straight. The way you presented it initially made very little sense.
---
A guild group with some random members is something different than a full pug. This did happen on high end servers towards the end of vanilla. Though it still is questionable as to why it was possible to ninja an item in such a raid.
---
If it was lvl 70, it really is a completely different case, it's odd to ostracize him because of a prestige item, but it's entirely possible, espeically if he led the raid, so he could be master looter.
---
I'd guess the average body weight of the people getting to 60 in two weeks is probably a little higher than most.
---
Oh yes, my main will be a gnome warlock. I'm not waiting on her lol
---
What's that got to do with anything?
---
As a human destruction warlock, I find you highly delicious.
---
I’m working the Monday and have Tuesday through Friday off.
---
It matters, but not so much that it should affect your decision over a strong visual preference.
---
Because warriors get special bonuses from critting, they basically scale better and better the more crit (gear) they get.  A warr with 15% crit (minimal +crit on gear) or a warrior pushing 30% crit (lots of nice gear with +crit or +agi) is huge.  Not only hitting harder from crits obviously, but generating much more rage as a result.
---
For the w horde
---
Wotlk had the tabard system
---
Thanks for the embedded links lol
---
Yeah this seems quite daunting...now that you mention it I might be better off leveling herbalism or mining to sell on the AH for $ then take the time at 60 to farm/buy greens and blues for enchanting.  
---
Thanks for mentioning that.
---
If you want to really minmax?  Yes.  If all you want to do is have fun, then race does not matter at all.
---
&gt; supposably 
---
What the fuck is this word.
---
I'm curious, what's their goals and what's your seeing advantage for pally? I've only raid as an alliance in vanilla, and always be jealous of tremors totems.
---
That’s a bit of a stretch for myself.  I rarely use F1-f4.  For Food/drink or anything out of combat, I hold shift and touch the scroll wheel for 1 click to the alternate action bar. 
---
Generally I use alt + 6-8 for combat consumables like potions and health stones. 
---
My alt + 1,2,3 - 8,9,0 is bound to the action bar right above the standard 1,2,3, - 8,9,0
---
Woah woah take it easy but it’s definitely VC no doubt about it
---
&gt;OP is raising a very real concern he had about the game
---
he was concerned enough to make the video and post here. But he wasn't concerned to use a search engine to find out if he needed too.  
---
&gt;  OP clearly wasnt aware this had been fixed 
---
OP is connected to the internet in the age of information. There is literally no excuse. Imagine working at an LLC creation website. some guy hits you up to make a new business. You ask him the name of his new business and he says; "Walmart". You say, "there is already a walmart, it went into business long ago". and the person overhearing this conversation(this would be you) says; "dOnT bE sUCH aN aSShOle, hE dIdNt kNoW".
---
Yea I know I’m stir crazy I know I know but !!!!!!1111!!!!!
---
Thanks for the recommendations, much appreciated. That said I’m very immature and the line “I used to do rape a lot” gave me a good laugh.
---
If a shaman can get your counterspell to miss either by juking it with a fake cast or a grounding totem then the shaman will almost definitely beat you in a battle of attrition.  But if you can effectively counterspell them then you basically win.  It's a fun fight, I used to duel a mage friend of mine a lot as enh and we would kind of cat and mouse for awhile trying to bait out either grounding totem or counterspell.
---
Thats my hope is that if we get tbc it will be rescaled to 60. Lvl 70 cap, flying and arenas were all huge mistakes
---
But this is a warlock discussion?
---
I have my first choice of name and a back-up in case it's taken.
---
Serious question: how many letters can we have in a name on classic?
---
"we were in Gnomer"
---
As an undead I just can do this:
---
¯\_(ツ)/_//¯
---
At least there's some food.
---
any source on this or did you just pull it out your arse
---
People should just play how they want to play.
---
NO CHANGES
---
And while I 100% agree that Blizz is a broken shell of it's former glory, **my** point is that the exact same can and is said about Jagex.
---
They've failed every other game launch they've ever tried outside of RS. They've ruined RS3. And *yet*, they too released an older version of their game, and have since created new content for it very, very successfully.
---
As for your second point, I've always thought that even if they went + or TBC, they'd be absolute brainlets to not allow standard nochanges Classic realms to still exist. Blizzard is bad, but (hopefully) not *that* bad.
---
Well my main will be a Warlock, the Warrior is just to fart around with wife as in he will never probably never see 60 in the first 4 months and I will never gear him so not a real alt, I'm guessing my first real alt will be a priest, still I want to focus hardcore on my lock and not wind up wasting time on a bunch of alts
---
Lord knows they need it
---
Trying hard

What are you judging that based on? Retail, where they don't want to make classic style content because the retail playerbase doesn't want it? Why not judge their ability to make classic style content based on Overwatch or Diablo 3 while you're at it. Those are just as relevant as looking at WoW. They have plenty of skilled designers that could do it if they were told "Do this in the style of classic WoW" and not "Try to innovate and create new systems".

1) stealth is exactly the same and impacted the same as rogues.  Rogue’s biggest advantage over druid is vanish and distract as facing matters for stealth a lot.
---
2) General rules - if you can equip it, you can use the item effect in forms (PvP trinket).  Pots, grenades, etc must be used in human form.
---
3) Engineering always gives you an edge, but druids have the biggest restrictions to use it effectively.  Always recommended for a serious PvPer.
---
4) You do you beau.  The ends justify the means.
---
5) 1/29/21 is the best PvP build/dungeon build hybrid.  Based on what you want to do, it seems like the best fit.
---
6) PvP gear is your best bet for this build.  You really want everything: str, stam, agi, int, spell power.  For dungeons be more focused on healing set, DPS, or tanking.  You’re going to need everything and have 4 semi-unique sets of gear... good luck.
---
7&amp;8) Again you do you.  There are advantages and disadvantages so you weigh what matters to you most.  The demand for druids on both sides is generally the same.  High for dungeons as a tank and medium to high in PvP depending on the BG.  Make a name for yourself and people will want you.

The most important use of skeletons was indicating to other players when celebrities had died. I remember an alliance player would leave skeletons in front of Org and I was like “oh no way Johnny Carson died” then I would go look it up.

---
On private servers the chest stays, in vanilla it despawned after a few min once opened. At least a few patches in.
---
&gt; You already posted this in this thread. The only looking for upvotes here is you. If OP didnt know this was fixed then inform him about it rather than calling him a lier. Makes you look rather pathethic. 
---
and you u/holyfrogger have already posted the same bullshit defense of someone that just needs to remove this post because they are posting not just redundant information. It's false. All OP had to do was read the patch notes. He is wrong for not removing it. You are wrong for spamming to his defense for something that is 100% his fault. You are actually making this more cringy than it has to be.
---
It's funny to me that you've mentioned that, because I've scheduled my vacations for 27 aug meaning to grind that 60, but decided to take a long weekend as well with the family after coming to the very same conclusion as you.
---
Lol that was the server being uploaded and data mined, which later we found out was for closed alpha.  It has nothing to do with an official announcement.

Gnome /silly are the best so that basically decides it IMO

---
Have they mentioned anything at all in the interview or elsewhere regarding re-implementing old damage fonts?
---
well for raids shammys are great but pally buffs are more consistent unless you bring tons of shamen 
---
also pallyies are some of the best PvP healers in game
---
Nah. And this Time i have plenty of lovely names from 120 chars :)
---
I misunderstood your original comment that's my bad. I thought you were only playing warrior.
---
Nah, people waste the most time not killing anything while they travel. They run from point A to point B not killing a single mob. Killing a mob while moving closer to point B is only slightly slower than running straight there, especially at 1-40. 
---
For example, as a paladin or warrior, your swing speed will be around 2.9-3.8s. What you should do is tag a mob, run for 3 seconds, turn around and hit it, run for another 3 seconds, turn around and hit it, then rinse and repeat. You’re losing barely any time but you’re gaining a ton of exp just traveling. That’s where a lot of new players lose a ton of time in vanilla. Is it tedious? It can be. Does it speed up leveling? Exponentially.
---
So where did keys go? Regular bag?
---
Unbridled Wrath is probably the weakest talent in the fury tree unless you are DWing with preferably fast weapons and are hitcapped. 
---
Booming voice also has it's PvP uses to reveal stealthers from the range they would absolutely not expect to do.
---
Pretty much. Origin story, lol.
---
This, and any post like it, just come off as though you're trying to convince yourself. If you're feeling insecure and you secretly want to rush, then do it! If you don't, then don't! If you know you want to rush and can't wait, I'll see you at 60!
---
I just see this stuff and laugh.

Ah, a fellow Boulderfister. Casual Dragon Knight druid checking in

$7 in the bank. Mark it down.

I’ve got a few friends who will beat me to 60 and if they dont I’ll start my hunter farm/crafting alt
---
Ive tried mages on horde, but i pref a warrior for tanking. I gave my warrior 2-3 sec of agro on bosses before nuking them
---
I hope we won‘t share a server at least
---
At least on top of that, encounters are a lot more mechanically intensive.  It's not just about having one button rotations, but having one button rotations in fairly simple mechanical fights.  
---
I still think shadow priest was super fun in legion, sure you press 5 buttons instead of 1 but the rapid-fire intensity and the quick decision making you have to use made it really fun.  I was just really sad it was not strong in m+, since I kind of hate raiding.
---
In BFA, WW monk was not that easy either.  You had a lot of different skills that built or dumped points and you had to manage and balance everything effectively.  I think you oversimplify "spenders and builders", because even though it's still kind of simple, it's less so than spamming shadowbolt.
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Wow head is literally the best game database to ever exist and your opinion is wrong.
---
Though I'm interested to know why you don't like wowhead.
---
Lol a lot of new players won’t. You’d be surprised the amount of new players even on pservers who don’t know where to find vanilla information. I’ve even met some who never even played WoW at all before their friend was on a pserver.
---
For a few days? No problem.For weeks / months? a whole other story.
---
There’s a somewhat similar event with feasting etc in vanilla though. Can’t remember the name
---
I see.. so you get UW only when you are very good geared and fury spec and on top of that you have fast weapons. Got it :)
---
This is all true, but if the mage can be slippery enough to avoid being bled to death by the Druid, the Druid should eventually run oom. Shifting in and out of forms is VERY mana intensive. If the mage is able to last long enough to reach that point, they should be able to kite and poke the Druid down...
---
Definitely not an easy feat, but that’s the only viable way I see the mage winning.
---
There's a very specific spot you have to do it.  I can upload a video later maybe.
---
hmm I wonder if the difference is in terms of objective? It seems (feel free to correct) you feel your objective IS to get to max level where as I find when I play my objective is to just experience the world as it comes with the overall adventure leading to 60?
---
I feel my time is spent the same if I am focused grinding levels fast to like 20 or something AND when I just sit by a lake and fish and shoot the shit with my buddy for an hour (in game). 
---
IIIIIIIIINteresting. Also, I didnt mean to say your way is in anyway wrong or anything just never really made sense to me

bingo

Humans are without doubt the best pve race, Gnomes can be very competitive in pvp tho
---
Why?
---
A Win Win Win you could say
---
Only correct answer. Even more correct if you meant Ettan løs
---
I never said it was healthy, but doing so for around 14-16 hours a day for a week isn't necessarily unhealthy as long as you stand up and stretch every now and then, still eat decently and when you're supposed to, have a decent sleeping schedule, etc.
---
Illegal servers
---
Great choice! The sense of community and cooperation really is great in this sub.
---
Does everyone roll need for the recipe, or will people usually let a priest with 300 tailoring take it?
---
Orc warlock or dwarf warrior, still can't decide on faction.  I've play horde longer, and in my short run in the few months before BC dropped I was a tauren drood so I'm thinking it might be fun to go Ally, but my longtime friends from Thrall US are staying horde so I'm a bit torn, because they are fun to play with but can't no life it like I can.
---
I think the point is that numerous WoW developers have commented over the years that vanilla shipped well before many of the original design intentions were fully fleshed out. Due to the need to generate new "boxes" to sell, the team was immediately pushed into making TBC, essentially leaving the vanilla world partially complete. You can see clear examples of this all over vanilla. Questlines which lead to nothing, entire zones which are half-finished, etc. etc. If the playerbase is robust enough (big IF), then I can't see a good reason for Blizzard to not devote a modest team to creating new content and iterating on this core IP. Modest incremental content additions (a dungeon here, a new zone there) for the next few years after Phase 6 is rolled out would be a great way to maintain subscribers and keep the gravy train rolling.
---
My main will be a mage and I plan to level tailoring, skinning, cooking and fishing along the way to 60.
---
Skinning will probably be fairly easy and I'm doing it for the extra gold one. Tailoring, I will be able to level somewhat passively like skinning, probably having to grind humanoids here and there but mostly it will level itself as lots of mobs drop cloth. I am also hoping to make some gold from mid-tier / late-game slot bags if I can get there first, and probably to supply to guildies for bank alts and the like.
---
Fishing I genuinely enjoy, I like to spend 10-15 minutes fishing before I log off after a long sesh to unwind and sort of plan my next day of gaming, and of course cooking is passive once I have a bag of fish - afk near a camp fire and it will level itself!
---
Not too worried about professions gimping my time to 60 as it will likely take me a few months anyway. They say 240 hours to 60, I won't be playing that often - maybe 2 hours an evening if I'm lucky, plus a few hours on weeks - so it'll take me a good 2 or 3 months anyway.

---
Not sure how every class is, but I've really enjoyed monk DPS. The difference between just doing a generic rotation vs the best possible for a given fight is like 30%. 
---
Problem is you need somewhat even competition to make it worth trying that hard in the first place.
---
Wow... no reason to be rude man!
---
Don’t they do that already?
---
I don't give a fuck.  Even on the off chance that's true, there's never an excuse to put pts into healing grace.  Also, ancestral healing is right there.   That's a top tier healing talent that every Rshaman should have.
---
Yes, doing over 20 hours a day is clearly overdoing it, but in the area of 14-16 really isn't too bad if you know how to take care of yourself.
---
Strange marketing decision
---
I’m on mobile but I’ll say two things.
---
Go to Taladrils spreadsheet if you want to see the relative strengths and weaknesses of gear. You can google t and it’s easy to find. It’s not the gospel but I think it’s 96% right.
---
Some items have “equip” as their tool tip and these procs will activate in bear or cat form. Something like earthshaker which has a chance on hit will not, but shard of the flame will.
---
Hard agree. If I don’t see 100% flask uptime on hogger with 75+ parse 0 chance youre getting in my stocks cleave comp
---
Same for me man.  Interesting thing is that I leveled a Hunter to 60 on PS just recently and in all endgame dungeons and UBRS (all I've done so far) I've comfortably been top DPS.  And on top of that I hit 60 in like 7 days played which is pretty quick for my first 60 in 10 years.
---
Certainly a lot of the best pve-players that I've met were on private but that's more than normal. I didn't do any pvp so I can't attest to that but most pvp wasn't a challenge anyway in Vanilla so I imagine there's a lot better players there as well. 
---
I've also recently met some of the worst players on an accelerated xp/p2w server. It reminded me of 2005. 
---
There's definitely highs and lows but you should never underestimate at what level people are playing on pservers. I heard some ridiculous streamer say that the best speed running guild on private wouldn't even enter top20 on live which is just delusional.
---
This cracked me up :D
---
Battle shout only affects your party and their pets, so you generally won't need the increase in range.
---
Both talents are pretty shit in pve, but unbridled wrath is better depending on wep speed, though for pvp booming voice to pop rogues out of stealth and even just the duration is nice, that and you are 2hing and have way less time aaing so unbridled wrath barely gives you more rage per second than boomings reduced rage need to upkeep battle. shout
---
Just wait till your on an 18 minute flightpath.
---
Not every player is going to be no lifing and the game is better taken at your own pace and make sure to have fun it’s all about the journey. 
---
Oh wait sorry. Autopilot.
---
It's all about having fun!
---
&gt;The only people at your level will be hardcore basement dwellers.
---
Exactly, that's why I joined a guild full of 'em.
---
Skarm talks from experience. He knows private servers arent accurate and  tgat we arent sure how it will be in Classic. 
---
Now you, you talk out of your ass. 14% parry is like 10% boss dps on average. On private server there is still a chance to get parried many times in a row. Why dont tanks occasionally blow up to bad parry RNG?
---
In order to say tanks will die in Classic to parry haste you have to assume that they hit much harder than private server. 
---
Cthun tentacles hit for 9k on private. You basically have to be flasked/ world buffed to survive. 
---
Watched a video from Vanilla where the tanks have 6k hp on Cthun lol. The bosses are not going to hit harder in Classic and the assumption is unjustified.

Glad to have wasted a minute of an asshole’s life tbh, was well worth it :)
---
It's not healthy per se, but it's not unhealthy. If we're assuming you're sleeping for 6 hours and playing for 16 then that leaves 2 hours worth of breaks from your PC. Split that 2 hours into regular 10/5 min breaks to get up, stretch and walk around a little then you're golden. You won't harm your body doing that for a week.
---
unless you are Tigger

then you are the only one!

Yeah, but what's going to be the best way to farm off the bat?
---
*gets popcorn*
---
I’ll be honest OP, I’m not rolling enh but I’m way more interested in someone’s opinion who has been playing and raiding for the last several years over some dude who hasn’t.  Additionally, your method of raging unprovoked doesn’t add credence to your ahh.. “insights”. Justified raging is fine. Raging unprovoked makes me think your kind of unqualified and just spouting off at the “mouth”. If you want people to take you seriously, have experience that isn’t from 15 yrs ago and.. actually know through trying and testing rather than hypothetical blathering.
---
only way to go
---
How long does that take? In the stress test I just got myself killed in the wetlands and spirit ran and zoned into deeprun tram to rez. I assume my method was worse, but I'm just curious about the actual time.
---
Them saying and them doing are very different. Obviously you were not in beta Mr.
---
DW fury, Unbridled Wrath
---
2h Arms PvP, Booming Voice
---
Unbridled Wrath is probably better for dual wielding because the 40% doesn't diminish the faster the weapon, as far as I know. If you're dpsing on a boss, and you hit with a white or yellow attack on average once per second, you're getting an extra 24 rage per minute (60 \* 0.4). For dw fury dpsing, the average hits per second might be even faster than that though, I'm not sure.
---
Booming Voice increases the range of Demoralizing Shout, which you can use to de-stealth rogues / druids in PvP. It can also be hard to prioritize Battle Shout in PvP, so having that extra minute of uptime can be very handy. Not too much value in terms of rage, because you generally want to hit battleshout at the end of combat before any excess rage decays.
---
Truly a predicament. I thought about going Alliance this time around as well just to experience something new - but at the end of the day my undying allegiance to the glorious Horde trumped that thought.
---
Chests and Rares while leveling
---
Definitely Europe.
---
Sure.  But again, that's assuming you are actually capable of matching a *world record* pace.  Which I would wager almost all of us are not.  To say nothing of the fact that maybe some of us are leveling Rogues or Warriors or anything besides the speedleveling classes.
---
When the entire basis of your argument hinges on *"sure, it's no problem, all I have to do is match the world record,"* I would argue you aren't totally thinking things through all the way.
---
&gt;Doea race matter for warrior?
---
Maybe roll asian for faster reflexes, or african if you have access to wow in jail
---
Great overview and I think you have the right mindset. I want to enjoy this experience so when I do finally hit 60 I am not overwhelmed by lvl 60 grind \[epic mount, pre-reqs for raiding and all of that other good stuff\]
---
Report the poor broken bastard and move on.
---
The last line covers it, but I could have been more clear than just saying AOE as some might take that to mean 3+ or 4+ only. Cleave can only hit a max of 3 targets so I assumed it was implied. Any time there is more than 1 enemy nearby you replace Heroic Strike with Cleave, but you still always want rage to use Whirlwind and Bloodthirst.
---
As for Improved Cleave - it only increases the "bonus damage" of the abilities. Cleave adds 50 damage at max rank, so therefore 120% bonus damage on Improved Cleave 3/3 adds just 60 damage. Technically this is a dps increase when using Cleave if you have another warrior giving you Battle Shout. Otherwise, in order to get this talent you have to take points out of something else that actually affects your dps.
---
Even with that talent your cleave is now doing 110 added damage for 20 rage. Heroic Strike adds 157 at max rank and costs 15 rage, or down to 12 with Improved Heroic Strike (almost always). It's certainly always a single target DPS loss to use Cleave over Heroic Strike for single target.
---
But this is someone that other people look up to for advice, and he doesn't know shit.  it's like watching a tipsout video.    I know the most about shaman, so maybe this is why this one irked me, but it's not limited there.   I just read a shit guide for prot warriors over on wowhead.
---
Honestly, getting the chance to get a name like Dennis is what interests me the most. Who wouldn't want the EPIC TAUREN WARRIOR IN FULL T3 TANKING KT NAMED...dennis.
---
This is what happens when we go on a blue post drought
---
His "experience" is that he "FEELS" that it procs a lot.
---
BV for leveling. UW is better for PvE DPS, though it still sucks.
---
I don't think anyone has ever successfully been told how they should have fun.
---
Am I the only one who plans to play the game when it comes out?
---
Never done these, still excited and even more about a possible classic bc :D
---
My only issue with this is, what do we on the classic servers after we clear naxx? I know that there are few servers that run vanila wow, but are they populated enough to keep blizzard running the servers? As i have no idea about these private servers, are they running over long period or they are "refreshing" them?  TBC seems to me, be the way. If classic ll be success.
---
\&gt; New content would need to be after Naxxramas progression-wise, otherwise guilds in Naxx are going to absolutely demolish it.  They can implement a sideways progression for resistances that only  matter for that raid (such as light resistance for a Scarlet raid), but  where would the entry point be in terms of gearing to start the light  resistance climb?
---
You're being way too narrow minded and biased towards a TBC expansion. There exists so much content that was supposed to be released, easily 4+ raids (karazhan, scarlet raid, hyjal, caverns of time, probably more that i'm forgetting). They can unlock zones that they planned for classic that could include 5-man dungeons.
---
\&gt; Do they just increase the level cap, invalidating ALL prior gear? 
---
Just make DIFFERENT gear. No need to increase level cap, wtf is this mentality? I swear r\*dditors are the biggest retards when it comes to their classic wow ideas. Go sort this subs posts by top of all time and check the planned content list. New professions could be added, yes new resistances could be added although that's a bit far fetched for now, new talent trees etc.
---
Power creep will be an issue in MMO's and it can't be easily dealt with. Check comments in this post about power creep if you want insight into that.
---
\&gt; And that’s not even getting into how many players/guilds will be dead  and gone, left in the wake of the logistic challenges of 40 man raiding. 
---
Why would guilds be dead? If they release content post-naxx every guild will have even more of a reason to come back to compete for the NEW raids world firsts etc.
---
Going to TBC will eventually cause the game to die, and it goes completely against the idea of Classic wow, because then people could argue that we should release Wotlk next and so on, eventually spiraling into madness and defeating the purpose of Classics release in the first place. Flying mounts are cancer, kills the entire solidarity in the world, wPvP dies along with it and the list goes on. I'm not even going to go deeper into why everything post-vanilla killed WoW incrementally. Of course we had some high peaks with Wotlk but that was a great expansion in terms of progression and lore.
---
Lol this entire online culture where people watch other people having fun and give them money is “cringe”
---
I can't wait for my macro'd out fury warr switching between stances 20 times in one duel lolol
---
halfway to my next month - why waste it with 0 game time when I can make that 7$ do something for me now?
---
Sad you are alliance but happy you get to relive some of your memories with your uncle and continue his legacy. Good luck, have fun, be safe.
---
well, not best friend but i started on an old character from my brother and he had a Troll rogue called "Lopp" or "Loop"(dont know after the long time) in the friendlist. After a time i needed help and noone but he was online so i asked him and he helped me. since then we were chatting sometimes and helped each other. I didn´t even know his real name or heard his voice. I hope its going to be a bit like that in Vanilla again and hope to find something like this again maybe more. It was a good time.
---
Ha ha who are you arguing with? A folder? lol
---
You right
---
You lose a lot of dps... The +5 swords and maces is OP
---
The topic is "does race matter" and the answer is "yes, it does"
---
awesome 
---
to the top of the sub I say!
---
That would be great
---
It's not like that doesn't exist in classic either, its just to a lesser extent. There's a lot of stuff you have to do to get a top parse in Molten Core as frost mage beyond just pressing frostbolt, and that's the simplest DPS spec...
---
&gt; You won't harm your body doing that for a week.
---
And most people won't hit 60 doing that either, which was the whole point of this.
---
keep trying, it's probably world lag
---
I’m playing pally but I’m not yet decided on race or gender so I have been making name lists for all 4 options
---
Wow dude go outside or get a job or something. You have way too much time on ur hands to do this thorough analysis and be triggered this much. What’s ur health insurance? My girl does therapy sessions and I can maybe get you a phone session if not in the area.
---
u/rivertold is confirmed the biggest retard there is
---
And people keep saying Blizzard is doing nothing to promote their game.
---
Now that I think about it, might have been start of TBC and not vanilla
---
Arguing with the people downvoting. Apparently pointing out another term they use for the game stepped on some toes.
---
Damn that looks way harder than spamming frostbolt
---
I remember seeing an instance portal in Stormwind behind a gate that in the canal. Does anyone know what that was used for if anything? I searched the web and I can't seem to find it, and everyone I pointed it out to didn't even know it existed.
---
Jesus just learn as you play.
---
You see that door marked pirate, do you think a pirate lives in there?
---
Maybe, I just assumed that it was. As it would make it much more easy for them. But I guess it doesn’t really matter if you really want to eat beef burgers anyways if you are a muslim. There is nothing in the Quran that says that the meat has to be halal, it is just tradition anyways.
---
because 1 idiot doesn't represent everyone
---
Look, I just want to play at my own pace. And if that means missing the launch and starting three months late, that doesn't make me casual. I am ENJOYING my JOURNEY.
---
I am not into phone sex.
---
Honestly I'm shocked by those comments. I have levelled characters to 60 in "authentic pservers" and, for real, the journey is the game. It's the best part. I can understand the appeal of being the best among the best, but the toll is too high for it to be worth it. It will require **ALL** of your freetime and effort and it will never be fun. The "fun part" will be the satisfaction of being so powerful, but even then, is it really worth it? Take your time. Rediscovered your beloved game, make new friends, enjoy the social aspect of the game. I am generally a competitive person but I feel like this is **NOT** how this game is meant to be played. Take a chill pill and enjoy the journey.
---
Right, with the REAL warchief again too . . Might as well just keep slaying gnomes!
---
I had a guy tell me there will be *hundreds* of layers per realm because "thats how the beta and stress test were"... There really is no arguing with straight up ignorance.
---
How often are you planning in critting with heals? You have almost no spell crit. And as you said why are you healing as an enhancement shaman?
---
No, I played on the same servers as Skarm I know what he says is right because I have experienced the same things lol. 
---
The trinket does proc a lot. THat doesn't mean you should use it for every fight. There are plenty of good trinkets you can use that aren't that terrible Onyxia one. Absolutely no reason to skip the neck. But then again, your best guild members are gonna leave for a tank that does good threat anyways so maybe it doesn't matter what you take.
---
I mean I'm not sure if you are super inexperienced in computers, but it literally took me 3 clicks to get to jaina's loot table.
---
Search jaina proudmoore-&gt;click on the first result in the list of npcs-&gt; there is all the loot with tabs for all the difficulties.
---
Also wowhead is most useful as an item database, I dunno why you expect it to have world first race stuff.
---
It's really not that hard.
---
Exactly! And to be honest, after a few hours questing or grinding mobs its quite nice to spend some time levelling up professions, organising your bank, mailing stuff to an alt, listing stuff on the AH. I too am probably going to go with the philosophy of doing everything at least once, including instances which are on the other continent. It won't be optimal to spend probably an entire day walking the other continent searching for Wailing Caverns, but I'm bloody doing it just because! Are you on EU? Because I'm in a guild with very likeminded people and we'd love to have you!

You'd better be a cute milk maid if you want to survive that remark.

I have no idea why you think im tryin to prove anything. For a TON OF PEOPLE the streamers was the announcement. They got invited to blizzard. They couldn’t say anything till that day. Everyone was in various streamers chat waiting for the announcement. I didn’t care about blizzards official announcement because i had it all read and told to me by a streamer.
---
Bruh, just cheel man.  Stop analyzing everything, just go with your gut when something seems too complex - your gut is often right.

Also, it often doesn't matter - should you pre-hot before pull?  Sure, but if you don't, 95% of the time it won't be the difference of someone dying/a wipe.

You’d think choosing race and class would be the hard part.....

Nice video, but I'm sure you can go 19 minutes without vaping. The sound is off putting and it makes you appear disinterested.

Hopefully your friends can be convinced by 15 year old graphics.

except this isn't just 1 idiot.  There's tons of these people out there.  Wowhead has a shit prot warrior guide up right now.   I saw a terrible Rshaman guide like a couple weeks ago
---
had to check. they do
---
Close your eyes and let your char autoattack.
---
Sure, please do!
---
Not very long. A lot faster than running all the way around even as a ghost. Try it in the next stress test and see fir yourself.

I'm not sure my name will be taken since it's the name of a song from an obscure weeb game. I'll probably sub just to make sure anyway.
---
Absolutely, there's nothing wrong with looking forward to other things more. I know I am - I didn't select RP either for that question. But at the end of the day, if RP ranks low enough for you that you didn't pick it as one of the things you're looking forward to the most, you probably shouldn't play on an RP server - or at the very least, you shouldn't be campaigning for Blizzard to launch with multiple RP servers, which will just split up the meager Classic RP community further and then dillute it with people who have no intention to RP in the first place.
---
And most of the private server theorycrafting community has been mocking that prot warrior guide relentlessly. A lot of these guides aren't made by the people that know what they're doing, they're made just by people who want to get exposure.
---
Also it says Shams can't use two handed weapons. Only staves
---
You see, when leveling a Warrior, you quickly take up pacifism out of necessity. Because if anyone actually wants you dead, you're fucked.
---
Then you hit 60.
---
And literally who cares about onyxia? And you can safe spot it so you don't take dmg
---
You should, it is situational good, and it gives you anti venoms.
---
Imagine the awesome titles too.

Most people are amazingly bad at all games.  Why would you think everyone on a private server would be good lol...
---
Sorry man this is a sad story- your uncle sounded like one of the best!
---
Dosey, he made your point for you.  Should we tell him?  OP.. Bro.. He's talking about you..
---
Not bad at all.

You mean, like an expansion?
---
Thanks for your contribution
---
Defcamp/Melderon are not known for being super skilled or theorycrafters, they're known for being YouTube personalities.
---
Why is nobody here mentioning hunters? If you come across a BM hunter as a mage you might as well just lie down and wait to be killed.
---
You can't be serious?  This is blatant copyright theft and piracy.
---
Better fix: Kill more people so you cover up the goldseller corpses.
---
I literally don't even see onyxia as a raid, it's a 20man boss which means its basically lfr for fun &amp; loot boss
---
It’s not a fair run though. 
---
Private server runs are quicker.
---
I know it is a style of play in Fifa. If you have very very fast players you have a big advantage. People would abuse this and have them sprint everywhere. Especially if they watch youtubers doing it. 
---
Hence the sweaty bit. 
---
Here it would mean try hards and people who would do absolutely everything to try to win.
---
Yarrrgghhh
---
imagine if the name reserve and thr stress test are the same day, and you can create your character and get them to 15, then everything you got stays untill the 27th. would be nice
---
Nice, I didn't get beta access sadly so can only go on what other people show me!
---
Damn fucking right they were.  Focus bullshitery ruined Hunters.
---
damn I hate when messages are removed - what did he say?
---
If you haven't done it before, you should imo first try it on a private server or with multiple free accounts. 
---
Start easy and use 3 mages. 
---
Make yourself comfortable with how they move together and make one or two macros to fight with.
---
If you have done that, try to mix different classes. 
---
Multiboxing is super fun but every now and then you will encounter something that you did not anticipate in the beginning. Multiboxing is a bit like playing the game from another perspective. If you don't start small there is a chance that you will not like it and then you wasted 5 subs. Also unless you shit the moneyz i would not use a 50 bugs per month tool to tip your toes into something that you might not even like.
---
Will classic hunters use focus?
---
I'll throw Greatwizard and Goth into that pile, amazingly skilled and has great videos.
---
I totally agree
---
So I’m looking to play a warlock, but pvp a lot at 60.
---
I was thinking of levelling with skinning and tailoring, for the money and gear respectively.
---
Is there a huge advantage to levelling engineering as I go, maybe with mining, rather than plan A?
---
(I was going to keep tailoring through bloodvine...)
---
Minmax ing racials for pve is a joke, the pserver tryhards even stopped doing it. Pick racials for pvp because it's a massive difference or just pick what you like
---
It was just “I don’t care about your shit blog post” or something equally as assholeish
---
Prayer of Healing spam to top meter?
---
*whoosh*
---
Great interview. Thanks for sharing!
---
That's not my memory from vanilla, it may stay longer or respawn not as soon though.
---
I'm probably going to level as fast as I can, and then spend the time it takes other people to get to 60 by farming up my reputations, professions, mats etc.
---
Classic wowhead has the old models, just plug in your BiS list.

Interrupt spirit regen 😅😅 You also have a thing or two to learn
---
I love playing without addons, when I gave BFA a go I achieved mythic 10, rival 2v2 and 3v3 and 1.8 cr in rated battle grounds. I felt seriously disadvantaged but it was about the only thing  the game feel authentic. Come classic I plan on using a minimum of addons or macros just so I can raise the "skillcap" on a personal level.
---
Well Brutality blade isn’t a great MH anyway. The choice for swords is Vis’Kag vs CTS. Dal’Rends are good though.

---
that's casual. proper use of time is doing it during the flight to thorium point before the run starts. casuals react, hardcores plan ahead.
---
Oh man. I remember rolling and winning on the eye of rend for my fury warrior. The PUG was pissed.
---
Haha nice one
---
Umm, I didn't downvote you. Where did you get that conclusion? 
---
I just stated, that the story as you initially presented was unlikely to have happened. I didn't say it was a lie, but a lie or a pserver story. I also didn't mean lie in the malicous sense, jsut in the sense, that didn't happen.
---
Mana :)
---
Yeah it's a shame because like you say, the animations and stuff are so damn good. I was so hyped when BFA came out, but I only made it to 119 before I suddenly hit that wall and accepted it was never going to be vanilla or even TBC again.
---
The game just looks way cooler than it is, while classic will be way cooler than it looks.
---
Question, can it be done at lvl 1? I just want to go as fast i can to meet up with my friends and prefably get the most human faction rep.
---
Yeah I can’t see how it would end up making a huge difference in raiding between gnome/human, but diplomacy is making me lean more towards human.
---
If you get all this done in phase one I will be pretty impressed.
---
Explanation?
---
Can’t sacrifice your social life if you don’t have one
---
Basically everyone on my server back in vanilla/tbc referred to it as VC as well. Never knew it was such a hot button until many xpacs later lol.
---
1st aid will be 300/300 way before I hit 60 if you mean that
---
Your mana regens if you have not casted anything in 5 seconds.    How do you not know this?  This is what I am talking about.  This is sad.
---
My server in vanilla had 1-3hr queues for BGs during the week which was horrible. Private servers I've been playing on had even longer PVP queues from 20-39 and no BGs at all from 40-51, cross-realm BGs will mean I'll be able to PVP in Classic even if I only have a free hour. Without them I'd wowquit.
---
FYI Tailoring is one of the weakest profs.
---
And how good do you think this for a shaman during 1 minute boss fights?
---
You don’t get that many places around here, sadly
---
Those aswell, just came up wit some quick names off  the bat there is so many more
---
Well for me it's phase 1 and done. Once bgs are in world PvP is never the same.
---
&gt; They will obviously hand out bans once they're detected through automated measurements 
---
I mean, they didn't back then. They said they did, but I never saw any proof of it. Chinese hunter bots were simply dime a dozen and reporting them amounted to fuckall.
---
That one worked, thanks. I haven't read it yet, but love how the title in full self-awareness awareness refers to it as *pseudointellectual*.
---
I am not saying it's impossible. I am just saying it's not healthy or normal (hence the having issues). Burning your brain (5-6h sleep per day for week does that) to replay a game is not worth it...
---
The thing is, modern WoW tries to combat it's simple rotations with complex bosses. I hate this design aesthetic personally. Classic has both simple rotations and simple bosses for the most part, but I think the real fun comes from the minutiae. Your rotation might be simple, and the boss might be simple, but those little improvements that eventually lead to your guild doing speed clears are often very rewarding, and much of the challenge of Classic is in preparation, which is often possible to make a very sociable experience and therefore fun, even if the prospect of farming is not inherently fun.
---
I think that's part of why people love TBC. Classes gained a decent bit of depth to them, while the bosses remained somewhat limited.

Felwood was ~amazing~ for that.  One of my favorite zones. 
---
Timbermaw rep grinding, lots of material nodes, oozes atmosphere. You can feel the lingering taint of Warcraft 3.
---
Was this a serious comment?  The retarded emojis makes it difficult to tell if you're actually uninformed just acting like an idiot because you crave attention.
---
Hahah ya holy shit did that underaged joke fly above his head.
---
&gt; dick move.
---
A HILARIOUS dick move. I mean seriously, how could you not think that, on a PVP server, you wouldn't get destroyed holding ANY event outside.
---
&gt; so I can walk away without a second thought.
---
Kek...
---
GTFO with "change this, change that."
---
Very true. Won't really matter until phase 2 anyway.
---
If you are levelling tailoring efficiently you will have barely any greens to dis until 215+ so they aren't quite as good a combo as you might think.
---
&gt;which would also get shit on by the bad roleplayers who do things like just assume their character knows your character class 'because it's obvious!'...
---
NPCs seem to be able to see it, and NPC dialog is the most extensive primary source we have for lore.
---
It is kind of silly, but I think there's textual support for the idea that you can tell what sort of adventurer a person is by looking at them.
---
It isn't, have you read the post?
---
More marketing than Blizz has done for classic...
---
Loot council may also fail to the fact that one of those core players isn't as good as another member of the raid and he'll still priorize himself because "he's the leader".
---
If those core people are the best players ever who are extremely dedicated, it may work. IMO it makes it worse that they all have a few friends with them as well, even more likely some will play favorites.
---
I'd see loot council work much better on an environment where people only know each other through the game and it's actually based on merit.
---
All that matters is humans has sword Skills increasing chance to hit which is great for pve.  Gnome has escape which is great for pvp roots
---
Sick wallpaper though
---
Nah layering takes away from the world dynamic so much. Especially for things like the STV world chest. It doesn’t feel... like a real world anymore.
---
Only now you're dead in better gear unless you have a healer friend to pocket dispel and heal.
---
This is cool and a little further than I made it during vanilla days (made it through most of MC only). But I was like 12 years old and had unlimited free time. This time around I want to get through AQ40 and at least step foot in Naxx. But realistically I have barely any free time and will be lucky to get through BWL. We will see...
---
really? Dudes made a website to calculate all healers downrank efficiencies with various amounts of spellpower etc. Thats quite a bit more than "just being a youtube personality"
---
Sure mate, tank your already abysmal DPS by regening 200 extra mana during a fight. Christ do you even believe this is the way to parse?
---
Naw man. One guy made bad talent choices in his opinion. It's time to make sweeping generalizations about the entire private server community.
---
Mystral Lake, Ashenvale
---
That's going to be really difficult to pull off. There isn't clear spec lines. Some BIS gear for one spec is awful for another etc.
---
Even if they open it, you're like "Might as well give him something for his trouble" and WHATEVER tip you choose, you're guaranteed to tip more than what is in those shitty ass boxes to begin with.
---
Hasn't it already been developed though?
---
They don't touch on RMT at all, do they? He just says that as long as you aren't botting, farming gold is legal. Third-party selling doesn't come up in the interview at all.
---
Just level fishing and cooking one day you are bored.
---
But this time the guys username suggest he has a social disorder so it's "edgy" this time!
---
I wish I was! I'm in NA -- thanks for the offer though, that sounds like a fun group to play with.
---
Yeah but 25 hours a week is a ton, man. Probably can make it happen but going from 0 hours to 25 hours a week adding a new thing into my schedule seems like quite a wrench in my day to day life.
---
Do you like to hatch dragon eggs?
---
Does we know which servers are going to be open? I wonder because im from South America..
---
Sure you can. Most of the sold gold comes from stolen accounts. Farming gold is extremely inefficient compared to looking up lists of compromised forum userbases etc. and trying out email/password combinations in WoW.
---
Thinking of going with either ankh or skullstriker
---
Pretty sure you can't eat friendly corpses.
---
we are getting the 1.12 version
---
:D
---
In what PvE? What are you even talking about with this spirit shit.
---
I accidentally zoomed my camera all the way into first person when I made a Tauren Warrior. I thought all warriors had to play in first person view so I deleted it and made a hunter.
---
On said Hunter I didn't know about talents until level 20-something, and I didn't learn about turning off my pet's growl for a while either. Fun times.
---
&gt; Both factions are at war, killing them is part of the game
---
Wow, it's odd to get a response to a month old comment, but allow me to clarify.
---
If PVP happens naturally in the game, that very much is a part of the game. Even consecutive killing and corpse camping are just a part of the experience. However, whether assisted or not by some 3rd party source of info to find a particular player's location(ie stream sniping) in order to target and kill them repetitively over long periods of time is considered [harassment](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/2151594004?page=2#post-27), as defined by that blue post.
---
Get my druid to 60. Get epic mount. Find or make a guild
---
Google “classic wow download size.”
---
What justifies mining then?
---
supposedly it was for player housing that never happened
---
&gt;Katricia: "Player housing will not be available until after World of Warcraft has been released. Our plan is to add player housing in a future live update or expansion. Our current idea (which could change) is to extend the cities to have player housing neighborhoods. For example, in the canal area of Stormwind players can see a blue instance portal behind a large portcullis; this is the entrance to the player housing neighborhood in Stormwind."
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Player_housing
---
round 5 gb depending on how they optimize it 
---
could be as low as 3.6 or so
---
That's a 50 dkp minus
---
Or when you were out leveling and suddenly you froze up, you knew an enemy was around.
---
yeah there are addons 
---
they will be available on the twitch/cruse thing same as retail
---
That's true lol. I am unsure myself if I will realistically be able to put in more than 20 hours a week.
---
**&lt;Sanctuary&gt; \[A\] are recruiting!**
---
**About**
---
Sanctuary is a UK based guild formed by a group of IRL friends, and are looking to go all in on Classic with big goals in mind. When it comes to potential recruits, all we ask is for  commitment as we are all learning the game as we go along, and with all the guides, spreadsheets etc.. available there is a good chance any questions can be answered.
---
We hope to be a big name on whatever server we choose, be it in PvE or PvP. Our guild discord is starting to pick up traction as we get closer to release, with a solid core, and a community of like minded people already getting to know each other, now is a great time to get involved in a group that's aiming to be here for the long term.
---
**Raid/PvP**
---
Our inital plans are three nights a week during progression, with it dropping ideally to one night a week during farm. Raid nights are currently scheduled to be Monday/Wednesday/Sunday from 7-10pm GMT, and the guild will all vote for the night we farm on once we reach that point. DKP will be used to distribute loot, however we are still deciding on which specific system to use to ensure that we can use the most optimal type while keeping it fair!
---
We've got a large amount of members who are also looking to get into PvP. We've built our discord to allow for both sides of the game to be accomodated properly.
---
Any questions? Please join our discord at [https://discord.gg/S95pCU](https://discord.gg/S95pCU) and feel free to message the GM or one of the Officers.
---
If Blizzard keeps making games for the top 1% of their player base, that's all they will have left when the game goes into maintenance mode.
---
To piggy back on point 4, as a Tauren you get +15 Herbalism which synergies really well when going through the starting area.
---
Also makes good money like Mining, so I’d recommend Skinning and Herbalism.
---
Thank you - will look it up!
---
People want the philosophies of classic to continue and not evolve the same way wow has
---
That's classic+, not tbc
---
Great, thanks! If you don't mind me asking - why are you jumping ship?
---
That's solid advice, appreciate it, thank you
---
Because I played a Tauren warrior (and bought milk to share with my friends) I upvoted this.
---
yay, cheating was awesome!
---
warcraft tavern is the new site for classic addons, I used some during beta. Worked well.
---
Gross, could shove in two "Undetermined" or something. Like maybe someone wants to grab herbalism but doesn't know what 2nd profession they are going to grab.
---
Parse?   Your a fucking enhancement shaman...  Your dps is a joke.
---
Thanks, I'll play around with this on the talent calculator but wouldn't you run into mana issues with this.
---
Why do you think they wouldn't release diremaul for 6 months?
---
The install is like 3.8 or so. Add a few patches down the road and maybe 4-5.
---
Learn the abilities of all the other classes. What do they depend on, what do they have to counter whatever you do and track them (either in your head or through addons like CD Frames, etc.).
---
The more you know about the classes as a whole, the better you are at playing your own and playing against others.
---
Save mankrik's wife
---
I had a guy a day before I unsubbed while we were running that Legion dungeon with fury of azhara do a recount, show it I was getting less than the other two DPS and kick me even though i was still beating out the tank and healer... apparently I wasn't good enough fr a faceroll...

* Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
**Alliance:**
---
* We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
**What we are looking for in members:**
---
* Priests!
---
* We are currently looking for social members, and raid alternates.
---
* We are currently filling our second raid roster

I completely agree. I would prefer if it didn't exist but I know it won't be nearly as bad as it was in beta. They need to phase it out as soon as possible after launch. 
---
 if the layer hopping countermeasures work, If they keep people on one layer as long as physically possible, it shouldnt be *too* bad.
---
Bee lining to SM and then not getting dark pact while leveling really doesn’t make sense. You’re going to respec at 60 anyways, and dark pact is huge for leveling efficiency, especially since VW is a worse leveling pet than it was on private servers.
---
If only it was that easy
---
Well, they mostly can't. They get two handed weapons from their 10 point Enhancement talent.
---
Find a good group to play with her then, surrounding yourself with like minded people will make it more fun.

Hope this helps some :)

met a tauren named Thunderfukk the other day.. had some laughing.

Trinketmenu and itemrack. There are classic versions.

Bad wording on my part: I meant do you think it will be rampant
---
Looking for a dungeon leveling group (ideally melee cleave) for launch. (Horde NA PVP)
---
Playing a warrior.
---
Plan on playing about 7 hours at launch, sleeping, then playing 15ish hours the next few days/until max level.
---
I work in TV, our season ends in 2 weeks. So, that's cool...
---
I'm fairly certain if I take 240-260 hours that I'll hit 60 in like 1 and a half months, maybe 2. 
---
Granted, I#ve currently got a ton of time, and will still keep IRL friendships alive but I think 2 months tops is realistic for my first 60
---
I'm the most excited of my friends who will be playing so I plan to spend the time where I am in head of them and they are offline to level my professions and generally enjoy the atmosphere of the game. So, trying to not rush and enjoy the journey. I was going to find the materials myself and level my professions sloooowly.
---
That's when the game starts getting good imo. RFD, ZF, Mara, ST are all super fun.
---
yes please. How am i going to knowwwwwwwwww
---
My first "hell yeah!" moment will probably be when I can queue up for SM and pepper those dungeons in with my STV leveling.  I always loved the 30-40 segment of leveling because I loved all 4 SM wings and loved STV as a zone, and not just for the PvP.  Nessingwary, Grom'gol, and just the general aesthetics of the zone were top notch.
---
This is genius. Added to my own list :P
---
yeah let´s center the game around a bunch of poopsockers what could go wrong?
---
particularly when it comes to weapons. You have half a raid wanting the same items.
---
I did a WOTLK and classic private server for a bit after unsubbing from the chore that is retail. I understand now how spoiled I am by retail hand feeding me everything
---
This post warms my heart. Maybe serve if you can reach out to some of his old guildies and see if they are intending on coming back. Would be cool to get a few of the elder statesmen as like an executive board for your guild, kinda a cool full circle story arc with you now leading the guild.

---
MoP rotations were so complex and rewarding. I played feral dps, demo/aff lock, and shadow priest. All dot classes but all played completely different with their own set of challenges and specialities. Going from MoP to WoD every class I enjoyed felt so gutted and lifeless in PvE content, it's what made me stop enjoying the game and what drove me to quit a few months later.
---
That's the way I used to do it, mage vs druid is a mana war with your ability to kite vs his ability to powershift out of roots, imo the druid has the advantage but I don't think it's a free win depending on the skill of the two players.
---
And you're still dead until you can farm raids/pvp for a few months and get stacked with good gear.
---
And you're still dead because that paladin you're playing with read some posts on reddit and decided to be a Ret instead of healing
---
Herb/Alch will generally make more money early on. Enchanting is a bit of a money sink until you get some rarer ones like crusader.

Herb/Alch will require you to go out and find materials to max your profit. Tailor/Chanter is more passive as you normally gather cloth from normal killing of things and the enchanting you have to stand around and advertise or sell your mats on the AH. 2 very different styles.

One time I was at my friend's house and he showed me how he climbed up some mountains to get into the area west of Searing Gorge. There was just this sheer drop off in the mountains there.  Then he slowfalled down to the ground and walked south for a bit until he got under Stormwind.
---
There was another way to get under Stormwind too that he showed me where you wall climbed at the front of the city by the big statue or whatever and there was a place you could fall through or something.
---
Would I then macro the two trinket slots to different keys or have a key for each trinket? I'm running out of easily accessible buttons.
---
yea, I have some unique names lined up so not in a hurry but I´ll still sub to contribute to the data.
---
You're damn skippy it was!
---
I spent hours on that site in the school library looking at lists of enemies by zone instead of whatever else I was supposed to be doing...
---
You won't be queueing up for them.
---
Not sure why this has been downvoted. Looks pretty cool if you ask me, however I think it would look better if it was a little less blood per hit.
---
Why should they do this? Ressoure wise it's the same. Serverload for 1 realm with 10 layers should be roughly the same as for 5 realms with 2 layers.
---
Hell I'll be happy to hit 20 in 2 weeks
---
You know what I mean!
---
Point remains. Small details like these are important and that opinion shouldnt get downvoted if you care about Authenticity.
---
75% of statistics are made up on the spot.
---
My feelings don't care about your facts.
---
That is what I loved about Classic. Most of the end game at first is in a giant mountain, straight out of LOTR.
---
You are in luck sir as I believe we fit all of your requirements or are at least quite close. We are looking to fill out a competitive raid group (of which we have about 42 players already) that are looking to raid Sat /Sun 12-3pm EST which if you are pacific would be 9AM-12pm. Our whole goal as a guild is consistent progression and to clear content as it is relevant. Many of us are taking the first week off to get ourselves there as quickly as possible. Your time frame is similar to what we are looking to achieve. Lastly, by some oddity we are actually short on warriors and just about nothing else lol. Strange considering the population right? Like I said you fit well.

Please feel free to reply here or send me a PM and we can take it from there. We would love to have you based on what I am seeing here.
---
My goal is to level my main (Hunter) to 60 by October 1st. I don't think I will need 240 hours to get there, but I should be able to put in that much time between launch and my goal date.
---
Please provide a meaningful objective metric that shows a night elf is always the worst choice, as you said 100% fact.
---
If you had played a night elf priest you would more thoroughly be able to relate practical experience.
---
Referring to WoTF as a “3 minute I win button”, shows you have no experience playing a UD S.priest, either. 
---
The only disservice is pretending to  be an expert when you are not, 
---
The most ridiculous part of this is the assumption that a priest racial can elevate a poor priest or handicap an excellent priest in pvp.
---
I'm leveling with a friend, and on our mains we intend to level things as we go. As for fishing, we'll probably take some time out when we want a change of pace and spend a day fishing to level up. Same with cooking, though that will likely be on the go like the main professions. We'll be splitting mats dropped (cloth/dropped items/etc) to help each other out along the way. We're doing a pally/lock duo, so gold isn't as important for us in the initial leveling since we'll both already have mounts.
---
I use to play WoW every morning with my uncle when I was like 11 or 12, he played a hunter, I played a mage, unfortunately my uncle passed away 3 years ago, he would have loved to play Classic WoW with me again, on launch I will be creating a hunter with his old characters name, and I know he is somewhere up there watching over me, and we will game once again and his hunter will slay giant beasts once more, this release will be for you, Uncle Jeff!
---
It's not possible on the results page of Google Forms. Like I said in my stickied comment though, I will release the raw data in a couple weeks and you will be able to filter the results to do exactly this and more. 
---
So you can see what the tank/heal/dps distribution of NA Horde Druids are, playing on RP servers.
---
Ive played a little but not a lot of this spec, and watched a lot of big name druids using it as well. Mana is a problem but your damage is a lot higher and the playstyle more proactive. Pounce+rake+rip+moonfire+swarm is a lot of DOT damage. Of course, without NS your defense is much decreased
---
It is not about population. It is about concurrent players. In Day one, concurrent players = total players. One week after, most people enter normal game play mode, dropping their login times from 10-12 hrs to 1-2.
---
After 1st week, concurrent player to total player ratio goes from 1:1 at launch day to 1:4. That alone means 75% less layers.
---
After the second week, tourists are gone.
---
Even if realms start with 10 layers, by the end of 2nd week, 9 of the layers are gone.
---
Whether you're committed or not aside, do remember to get up and stay even mildly active. There were dozens of stories of people over in Asia literally dying from going on gaming benders. Granted, they were going 24 hours+, but the danger to your body is real.  
---
When ever you have a chance to point your character in the right direction and auto-run, just get up and stretch for a few minutes, go get some water, whatever. Just get up.
---
No ItemRack for classic yet unfortunately :/
---
Oddly enough, I saw this tidbit on another guide, and didn't question it.  A guide that is circulated around here frequently. 
---
You may be right though.   It depends on the exact mechanics of the 5 second rule though.   It doesn't work on the pirated server I am on atm, but whether its coded properly there or not is anyone's guess.
---
So having been a very competitive mythic raider.. the rotations are just not remotely that simple if you are actually pushing difficult content.
---
When I raided seriously I put up orange logs (top 5%) on every heroic fight for two raid tiers playing assassin rogue. And let me tell ya.. it wasn't as simple as "build and spend." Getting maximum dps out of modern builds requires lots of forethought, careful positioning, and a shitpot of research to know how to get your rotation down perfectly.
---
I mean yeah, for LFG you can still just cast sinister strike and eviscerate.. but if you actually want to be putting out 90%+ of your theoretical dps in a raid environment, it is a very careful dance you walk. Which definitely didn't exist in Classic.
---
Your TLDR is accurate, but lets not oversimplify BFA's fight mechanics.. which are definitely more "engaging" than classic wow will be.
---
I see someone is chumming the waters with the proper meat.  They must be going after the Big One.
---
Reading this made me think about all of the people I used to play with, and what became of them after vanilla. Hopefully they are all alive and doing well, but who knows truly? Before steam and discord it was harder to keep up with people outside of ventrilo/TS and in-game. I know a lot of my guildies either split off or quit once TBC started. 
---
Thanks for sharing your story. I hope you get the chance to relive your nostalgia and make your uncle proud.
---
Very cool, thanks!
---
You should probably at least lvl to 6 then do the skip
---
Nice one
---
Just hope the other person has no stam so you can charge and 1 shot them with a crit
---
Users can be anticipating spending more time launch week, and then slowing down afterwards?
---
This should just be in r/wow...
---
I was just excited for some info.
---
I'm sorry, but with 2019 Cloud tech that Blizzard has used for there previous 2 expansions (BfA, Legion) and both of them have very, very little trouble maybe the first hour was awful, then there is 0 fucking excuse for the demand to outweigh the hardware they have. 
---
AWS is basically an elastic band that will basically scale infinitely and then wind down as needed, as long as they are willing to pay for it.
---
I voted phase 1 just because I'm excited for release.
---
I mean even if they're not mechanically good, the game is solved enough for them to easily find out what gear they need, what talents to take, what races are optimal, etc.
---
Joanna's guide is good for new players but it's a bit outdated these days. As a duo I would say quest or get a 5man dungeon group to grind. Pure grinding is best done solo.

Not me.. I was a female undead rogue named "Hoebo". 12 year old me liked hobos for some odd reason. Prior to that I was playing Diablo 2 as an Amazon main named Tittney_Spears... Lmao.

I'm sure there are people who put they're playing a Tauren Rouge Tank. As there are more responses it'll settle out some.
---
Those crocs don't care as much about the path as they should!
---
I was speaking in theory; I have absolutely no knowledge of how such systems are handled by Blizzard in practice.
---
Fury warriors definitely beat mages. Rogues probably do as well. 
---
Early tiers mages do less dps period. Later tiers there’s one mage that has a chance to beat the rogues and maybe warriors due to ignites, but the rest of the class remains below warriors and rogues. They’re the best ranged dps and competitive with warriors and rogues for sure, but played optimally they’re definitely not the best at pve.

How can you want Classic and defend crossrealm battlegrounde?

It's all about keeping Agility Scrolls and other potions/elixirs/herbs/etc to tip them. If you do that long enough, eventually you'll find a kindly Rogue who invites you to work via mail-order to save time meeting in town.

No, amphetamine takes the fast way, directly through your nosewall into the brain.
---
So you’re categorizing hundreds of thousands of players based on a video made from one random guy within that population?
---
Should change your title from ‘Unpopular Opinion’ to ‘Ignorant Opinion’ and it would better represent things.
---
As with any large community of video game players, there is a range of skill levels from absolutely elite to absolutely abysmal.  Will be the same on Classic as well.

One does not simply "finish" World of Warcraft.
---
Thanks for the info! Trying to gather up as much as I can before classic hits. Haven't played Pservers nor retail since wotlk so there's so much to catch up on.
---
Guess I might look into modifying Joana's guide a little bit to make it more suitable. Bound to be other guides to learn from as well.
---
We had cross server BGs in 1.12, classic is a recreation of 1.12. End of story
---
We can defend it because it was in vanilla.
---
I'm not saying classic is bad with the one button rotations that many classes have, but when you combo that with little to no boss mechanics for ranged players the difference is a little more stark. Yes, the classes in retail have been homogenized and can do anything, but they have different flavors and you have a couple buttons to push. Also, the boss fights are farrr more complex. That makes up most of the fun, not some super simple rotation.

Also that its 1080p. I dint think there were many people that had machines that could handle that resolution when wow came out. Most people I knew were still on CRT monitors and upgrading to 720p. TVs cost a lot even 2 or 3 years later at that resolution.
---
From reading the comments you appear to be the only other person here whose ever actually tried to optimize your raid dps in the modern WoW...
---
In legion I could consistently out-dps rogues that simmed 10% higher than myself because I was knee deep in the theorycraft and optimal rotation game. a 1.5 second difference in rupture timing could reduce your dps by easily 5-10% in a 3 minute encounter. Modern dps isn't "bop it" like people imply.. but if you are just doing normal mode your dps doesn't matter anyways. You just need to not be a total moron and you can frost bolt spam your way to victory
---
Lmaooooo
---
The response was added. 
---
I will not be creating any graphics for the data - however I'm sure there will be dozens of submissions and videos doing so.
---
Wrong.
---
Classic gameplay isn't about spell rotations, it's all about  the utility and situational spells whick BFA really lacks
---
Farming 100 arcane crystals for my thunderfury.
---
Soon^^TM
---
Hinterlands. Must kill all moonkins.
---
That's probably not the issue. Getting geared, attunement, and all consumables necessary to clear naxx is a far, far, far bigger time sink than wiping in naxx itself.
---
You will see this once the raw results are posted.
---
I had the opposite experience. Before playing warriors I was relatively hands-off. As a warrior though, you realize that the only chance in hell you have is if you get the initiative, get your charge off which then lets you have the rage and positioning to have a fighting chance. The best survival strategy I found was not to hesitate when seeing the other faction and just attack.
---
*”100% natural, fresh, never frozen”*
---
Hmm, so I assume no WotLK content
---
You will see this once the raw results are posted, like is stated in the stickied comment.
---
I guess people are butthurt that someone can do something they can't imagine doing?
---
It was in vanilla so it belongs in Classic as well.  And I’ll add that this is a very good thing.
---
As long as you're fine capping your gear at pvp blues you can totally sit in town and do wsg all day.
---
I'm assuming you're using Firefox? It's been brought to our attention, we do not know how to fix it, however we will be updating the CSS around launch.
---
I'm up in the air between human or dwarf for my priest, atm I'm the only person in my current guild who even signed up to be priest so I would be literally the only fear ward, but Feedback seems like it'd be sweet for PvP assuming it can proc blackout. 
---
Also conflicted on male or female dwarf, I'm leaning male but dem spinny ponytails...
---
Breaking news
---
From your 3 choices, Hunter needs engineering the most, Druid the least.
---
You're not wrong for not having engineering on any of your characters.  Some people want to blow sapper charges in world PvP 1v1s over a Thorium Vein.  Some people like myself sparingly even use cheap grenades or use anything but the death ray.  It's really up to your playstyle.
---
It’ll start out as a boe recipe cuz it’s a 1.12 client, but typically people are pretty understanding about it if a priest needs it to craft their robes. Can always reserve it or offer to trade the orbs you got for it if people want to be difficult. Strat live orb farm is one of the best ways to make gold in p1 so you’ll be doing a fair few runs of it regardless.
---
Fucking brd torch room.  Stuff like that is so much fun.
---
And those configs can either point to different resource names (requiring no conditional business logic in the code), or contain values that tell the application to behave a certain way (requiring additional conditional business logic in the code). 
---
I'm not sure what your point is. My point wasn't that it's hard, but that it is higher complexity than using different resources.
---
100s of thousands?  That's being generous.
---
Will name reservation take place in the classic client itself or on the website?
---
Stv is definitely an incredible zone. The longevity of that zone is unmatched. You go into that zone at around 30-33 and finish the last few quests around 45-50. Only other zone that felt as plentiful in quests is the barrens. I love horde
---
on that part of the survey I put "for the horde" except then said I was playing a dwarf lol
---
I always kinda liked this journey on new Night Elves &amp; Draenei. Had a little sense of danger from the Wetlands crocs and orcs but otherwise a pretty chill trip to watch an episode of a show to and collect all the flight points for later
---
Yeah it sucks but at least we’re getting months of world pvp before phase 3 introduces BGs. So make the most of it.
---
Actually my list was primarily about youtubers not streamers and just because he's "known to be an ass" doesn't make him less talented or knowledgeable
---
Same for me! Brill evokes a similar feeling to Darkshire for me. I adore both locations.
---
Naxx was in 1.12 as well so I guess it should be released in phase 1 then right?
---
I'm that case go for it, I mustve misread the post
---
You should go paladin because you belong on the alliance.
---
3rd hunter.
---
same for paladins no charger until phase 2 because we need dire maul, i think i will save the money and mats for phase 2 instead of buying the normal epic mount
---
That moment when you set foot in Ragnaros's chamber, and the epic boss battle music starts playing, then a huge fiery colossus erupts from the lava
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIPX0Fe75Do
---
Thanks for your helpful comment. Trying to remember to enable it when the game launches.
---
&gt;Just getting to the level cap and running 5 man dungeons will be a huge accomplishment. I hope to be in that position by Nov/December.
---
This is actually what made classic so great. It was a LONG time before "everyone" was at 60 and mostly geared. I think around AQ or Naxx is when most casual players got to that point. 
---
I look forward to being able to find people to run dungeons with the whole time. I don't care if its not technically as efficient as grinding, it's a great way to meet new people and fill out your friends list.
---
Epic story, thanks for sharing
---
Plenty of time to do that tho. There's no TBC around the corner shortly after Naxx this time around.
---
It’s being extremely accurate, actually.
---
Maybe you could also mark an X every hour or every level for your location with a little number next to the top right of it, and then you can join the dots to show your levelling/playing journey.
---
Unless you decide to be a PvP god.
---
Nost was 'fine' even at 10k concurrent players.
---
Best-&gt; warrior
---
Worst -&gt;paladin
---
while paladin may be the best healer, its certainly more of an incomplete class as a whole.
---
Warrior has an amazing toolkit, I am biased tho as i have never played Mage or Rogue, but a good warrior can carry a group the best
---
&gt; Referring to WoTF as a “3 minute I win button”
---
I meant devouring plague.... I can't really convince someone who doesn't even really know what they're talking about...
---
Like I said "gnome racial and size is good for PvP."
---
If you are focusing on pvp, sure.  The dps boost for human is much higher than 1%...it's probably higher than 3%.  This is very significant
---
Guy wants to do pvp and pve.  And is leaning toward playing a gnome.  A gnome warrior can do basically anything a human can do with the same gear and skill level.  Yes you will lose some dps in pve, but you aren't exactly crippled.
---
If he was leaning toward human but was worried about being crippled without escape artist id tell him the same thing.  Play the race you want you'll be 99% as effective as the minmax choice.
---
It was added in patch 1.12. Classic is using patch 1.12. This is a non-issue and you are just trolling.
---
You say it will hurt the game a lot? Care to explain how being able to queue for a BG hurts the game?
---
And borderline OCD.  :)
---
It's the druid.  A true and proper hybrid.
---
And there's still guilds that haven't done 4hm on that server.
---
There's also guilds that split up before even getting that far. Not every e got to clear there, and not everyone will get to clear in classic :)
---
I get what you’re saying but it’s not that far from reality imo. Classic won’t be filled with many new players who choose classes without any research or prior experience. Those new players you described will be playing retail, not some non-advertised 15 year old blizzard game that only active gamers know exists. A significant chunk of players will be from private servers. 
---
But I hope you’re right.
---
&gt;There are no dailies
---
Yeah. Farming gold was a lot more open in classic. You could do a LOT of different things to make money and most of them were worthwhile. 
---
Since it was mostly done in the world, sometimes you'd make more money going to a second tier farming spot just so you wouldn't have competition. The lack of daily quest theme parks makes the whole world feel alive.
---
Mage. It really has zero problems with the class and can do everything well on its own, or in groups. Good dps, good farming, teleport and food/water, good cc, good burst. 
---
My unpopular opinion is shaman. They are meant to be the most alpha caster in the game with the ability to zap you in seconds, and heal themselves away.
---
Warrior tanks still have Berserker Rage, so they have their own fear removal. You also need to be in the same group (AFAIK totems arent raidwide) as the shaman putting down the tremor totem and the shaman needs to put it down close enough to the tank for them to be in radius. Fear Ward is just a buff any dwarf priest can cast on anyone.
---
EU isn’t a country :)
---
To be honest that was one of the greatest runs I ever had. Early enough in vanilla that I had no clue what was going on and everything was super exciting. Back then you actually thought that you could find supercool stuff around and maybe even a treasure.😂
---
Hey Pterodactly,
---
I think you messaged me last week as well. Every other weekend I do not work so there is no issue of timing (or even extensions if needed) Otherwise I work 2nd shift and have to leave my house between 11:45am and 12Noon. So there is a slight collision here for the last 0-15mins of the raid depending on traffic which will dictate when I have to leave. My typical leaving time is 11:50a to 12:10pm.
---
If this is fine for you and will not affect my ability to be part of the Core group, then we can chat more. Let me know.
---
The average time to 60 is really fucking slow, anyone with a good guide and a basic grasp of game mechanics can do it in under five days /played. 
---
Different people obviously have different goals, some people haven't done Vanilla levelling in 15 years and many might want to enjoy this particular aspect of the game. There are also people who want to experience  riding the top of the wave, being the geared guy before the release of battlegrounds, completing raids when they're current tier. I'm simply pointing out that even many people with responsibilities can achieve this experience.
---
BSH added in P2. Is that correct? Why is it not in P1?
---
I will see you in Teldrassil friend!
---
I mean bgs are not in phase 1?
---
Provide evidence that fury prot is not worth doing. Enlighten all the theory crafters that disagree with your bullshit.
---
There was a workable version going around the discords on beta. I'll see if I can grab it when I get home.
---
The most important feature of the guild is membership. Without raiders, there are no raids. So we need to offer an incentive to raid with us instead of some other guild. Loot is a great incentive. So loot distribution methods that keep everyone coming back are actually *super important* for guild health.
---
Using the loot to gear only the most optimal people speeds progression but is bad for morale.
---
Well this is the first marketing I’ve seen for classic. Looks good.
---
Use red pins for deaths and green ones for level ups!

The Warrior Hello
---
These people on the sub do not match the average user player base.  A million people who will play classic wow dont browse the reddit forums. This data is biased, but there is not any other choice really. 
---
Imagine If I went to MIT and asked all the college students there what is their favorite thing to do on the weekends.  I would then take that data and say: This is what college students love to do on the weekends.

Doubtful its very accurate.

But wouldn't it be the ultimate experience to have classic then they finish it? Caverns of Time Mt. Hyjal Throne room in Ironforge the Air Strip probably many more I never found or even heard of. I remember the king of Stormwind being in prison on that island then disappearing to never return once it was filled with elite naga.
---
All of this stuff is in the "vanilla" release of the game. Would make for a sure interesting endgame!
---
Please do, since they don't seem to have said a single word about that and there is no reason to believe that the single layer population would be any higher than vanilla.
---
I assume on the client. I'm not sure.
---
&gt; You’ve been wrong about nelfs, you were wrong about UD
---
LMAO yeah, the guy who literally couldn't even figure out what I'm talking about now knows I'm wrong. You literally had no idea what I was saying! lmao
---
Amazing lol. It's clear we are both very different tiers of player.
---
Yes, Nightelf is fine for a casual player. At your level I'm sure it won't make a lick of difference what race you roll.
---
As someone who has been a part of 10+ server firsts and has hit rank 12 on several characters (in Vanilla, not on private servers), I would roll Dwarf on Alliance and Troll on Horde (shadowguard proc OP).
---
But for someone of your level you are right, it probably won't matter.
---
Options :
---
1. Stress test next week, name reserve a week later
---
2. Stress test and name reserve in the same time
---
3. Name reserve in 2 weeks, stress test in 3 weeks.
---
It is also a low possibility that there won't be another stress test.
---
So you aren’t going to address the actual ignorance pointed out about your post but instead going to try to deflect?
---
Human female does have a smaller model and is able to jump through some openings that the male can not.  For instance a female can jump out of the window at the top of a dwarf bunker, a male has to use the door.
---
And you guys said there was no Classic marketing.
---
Mage for sure.  
---
It has the most complete kit for all aspects of the game.
---
I guarantee they did this only to fight Activision in a trademark dispute &amp; get certain people extra cash.
---
My choice of class reflects me ADD. I love pets and totems. Micromanagement ftw.
---
Shhhhh. Don't share the ultimate secret to everyone.
---
I’m not. EU people are just some of the most salty people towards NA in video games and it comes off as some sort of insecurity issue. It’s lame and NA people could care less because we’re destroying you in aspects of life that actually matter.
---
Gnome nuggets.
---
Hahaha this is truly your best work. Amazing theory crafting. You sure showed us!!
---
What are you taking about. I'm saying that he's a bad resource to learn from. That's what I'm talking about.  I'm saying don't bother learning from an asshole because it's going to turn people off the game. There's tons of streamers/YouTube creators than are as good as perplexity but not incredibly toxic.
---
player housing is a shitty meme.  go play animal crossing if you want to play house
---
That’s a good point. I think with the sacrifice of a lot of the extra polygons that classic lacks, 95% of anyone who plays should be fine
---
Forever in 1.12 with content locked behind phases.
---
I spammed frostbolt during vanilla, but I never thought about it that way at the time. It wasnt what the game was about for us then. Was my rotation a little mundane in MC? So what. Raiding was so cool. Chatting on VT was so cool. Standing around IF with your new Azuresong Mageblade was so cool. 
---
Nowadays people are like omg these mechanics are boring screw this game.. or omg my class sucks abit this week I reroll
---
It's going to forever be patch 1.12, with gradually releasing content in phases.
---
Hahaha at least you can’t possibly know what realm I’m going to choose......
---
I don't think you realize what classic is...
---
It a recreation not a remake or remaster
---
It will be as it was, or as close as possible
---
It's going to forever be patch 1.12, with gradually releasing content in phases.  
---
They had an entire post regarding how they were going to handle it.
---
U have to shiv ur shav
---
I thought everyone in the group would roll need on the pattern, since it's BoE (I'm assuming I'll be in pugs, but we'll see).
---
But maybe you're convincing me that tailoring is pretty good anyway, and I can eventually make the robes. Maybe I'll go Tailoring/Enchanting, since wands are good for Priest leveling. Or Skinning/Tailoring.
---
I have no grudges about minmax lol I cleared mc on day ten on a pserver, I am just giving my (and plenty other tryhard vanilla players) opinion on racials in pve. They are much better to utilize for pvp instead and guess what my guild with server first MC and onyxia had 3/4 ORC hunters instead of troll and the completing ally guild? They didn't even have humans in their raids. Minmax pvp is way superior
---
Improved Drain Soul is not worth it IMO. I'd go into demonology right after nightfall, or right after siphon life to improve survivability in pvp areas.
---
You got me there
---
If you provided an RP-PVP option at the top, you'd actually see how many people want to roll on it, given that you only allowed 3 options in "looking forward to" and there's at least 6 on that list for me.
---
Actually inspecting people and that being a thing is something i’ve missed in all expansions beyond vanilla. 
---
Gear was rare back then and inspecting people was fun.
---
I used druid bar in vanilla and it was 100% accurate I believe.
---
Honestly I have no idea, it was just a vague impression I had gotten
---
Apprentice training costs 10c. Skinning knife is 80ish copper?
---
1 silver should get you started.
---
Also: RIP bags.
---
&gt; Nobody batted an eye at that but people seem to be going batshit over me saying it's roughly 240 hours played. 
---
People aren't very smart in general. We use language like this in our app all the time.  $30/month? Go Fuck yourself.  $1/day? Sign me up!
---
Needs more wands.
---
You cleared mc? Omg look out everybody!
---
Hunter dps isn’t great in raids, but it’s mandatory to bring a couple for utility and buffs. Tranq shot is required for at least one boss in all raids I think, meaning you need 2 hunters to rotate shots at the minimum. Trueshot aura at 40 is also super nice to have, and hunters are great at kiting encounters that need to be kited. Pretty shit dps end game though.
---
Absolutely I did. Someone didn't actually watch the video.
---
This. So much!

So you are talking about a topic that is outside of this post... Ok very useful thanks for feedback

So, are the names still locked to your account for a while after you delete the character? I'm trying to decide if I should fully customize my toon's looks and then name him and lock it in or just do a stock warrior with the name I want and then delete it and do a proper character creation.
---
I played on Malygos for a long time... What was your name? Not sure how long you played there, but I was in a guild called Blades of Rage for quite a while before I transferred my main over to Skullcrusher during WotLK..
---
I once heard that it has to do with bar fights. Keep your feet on the ground = no dirty fighting.
---
I dunno if it has any weight to it though.
---
If youre true 100% autism minmax then yeah many hardcore pvpers use female models for quicker los
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
I'm not worried.
---
It's a few days or weeks after launch.
---
Waking up a bit too early, still a bit groggy from playing late last night but you're awake and already foggy memories of murlocs and boars filter through the haze of waking. A quick cup of coffee and some eggs, then donning comfy headphones where the rising theme of Azeroth soothes you through the realization that you didn't log out at an Inn. Someone messages you "you're up early!" and you reply "you too!" and they mention they haven't slept yet, and link some item they got from the 3rd run of that dungeon.
---
You begin to assess your quest log and think about some route plans. All of which you easily change if you hear someone looking for your class in a dungeon, help with an Elite, whatever seems fun and interesting and challenging. Today is about relaxing into the experience and not really worrying about rushing to do anything in particular - not beholden to anything or anyone but your own carpice.
---
It will also be nice when I have my Bank Alt setup, with my main and alt both have full bags. The awkward first phase where your only Silver goes towards new bags and a few class skills is rather dull to me, so I guess I'm mostly looking forward to the 10-40~ phase.
---
I want to see world of warcraft reforged.  Also, a way to pay for my subscription with gold.
---
Says the guy who thinks you need exploits tp get max troll berserking lmao. You can just take off all your stamina gear , then equip it all and pop berserking then go hit the boss.
---
On day ten.. I cleared Naxx too if that means something for you
---
17% warrior
---
14% tank
---
Yep
---
True. I guess the hopeless aspirations i have say if it is inclient that it be at a time i can get on fast at home or if its web based i can do so from my phone
---
Is that edge important, lol sorry I know this sounded strange but I thought b.s once I heard this lol
---
was this ever adressed during a Q&amp;A?
---
I never played Alliance, but the trip through wetlands always looked like a big oversight.
---
if you want to be as efficient as possible you should stay in the tree
---
You are the one that brought up different people to learn from.
---
It will most certainly save you time.

I see a good argument for RP-PVP being added (and I initially wanted it), but ultimately, this census is designed to see how people will actually play when Classic launches. Given everything Blizzard has been saying, RP-PVP isn't happening at launch, so it's not an option here either.
---
Think arenas will be in classic, eventually?

I don't know what I think.

We can call it "Shit WoW" instead.

Would that make you happy?
---
&gt;	they are talking about private servers, then we can‘t draw 1:1 parallels here.

Also I suppose you concede your argument then, given how we are now at the average being 12d rather than only 10% being 3-14d.

Hopefully you don't have a common name.

Clearing naxx shows someone raided alot
---
10 day mc just means you no lifed it for a week and got into the first mc
---
If you are limited on time go hunter respecting all the time wont be an option to many without the rediculas amount of time spent to farm gold. If you are respecting alot you probably wont get riding or your mount. Which honestly would be so bad for your enjoyment
---
I'm just gonna bite the bullet and roll rogue. If it's over crowded class then I just have to make sure I get ahead of the curve when leveling and gearing

Just create the Warrior and delete it on launch day. Make your new character immediately after deleting.
---
well do you want to heal or DPS is the real question
---
but from reading your post it seems like hunter is a better fit for you
---
Nope just listed some players that are good so op can see pserver players aren't shot like he claims
---
HEY! ARRRRNOOOOOLLLDDDD!

Outline.com is pretty great at cleaning up the bullshit on websites, does a decent job for mobile as well.
---
Deng to late D;
---
Protip: don't make the run until you can actually quest in Wetlands. Saves you time in the end.
---
Wanna try a run that's even more fun?  Join the Horde, get level 37-38 and run from Hammerfall to Kargath.
---
Sitting on your ass for an 18 hour period and taking 2 minutes to stretch every hour is still pretty damn unhealthy no matter what you are doing. Even more so if you do it several days in a row.
---
Even if we assume you are eating salads and fitness shakes the whole time it's still pretty bad for you. 
---
And deep down we all know you're ordering take out, drinking soda and not stretching every hour like you pretend.
---
You want to be the first neckbeard to 60? Congratulations, most people will think of you as a loser rather than some paragon of gaming skill.
---
Upvoting your name not your comment just so we’re clear
---
Late answer but I disagree with the other answer. I raided until AQ40 and very rarely used a mic. You'll get by without a mic even when raiding. The important part, if you don't want to lead anything, is listening. Short answers can be perfectly given in chat.
---
Okay what are you getting at? I also havee a sub 2hour aq clear without wbuffs but I guess you can find some other excuse to say it doesn't matter.
---
Anyway I'm not saying raiding is hard or that I'm proud of my pve achievements im not because classic raiding is a joke, hence why I joke about getting racials for it when you can get smth better like pvp racials.
---
Guess what?  You are getting WoW without BGs!  Then they'll show up later.
---
Way more than 1-3%.  
---
You lose 3% hit, and your glancing penalty goes from 15% to 40%.  Plus, you have .5% higher chance to be dodged and parried (if applicable).  Finally, there is also a slight difference in crit.
---
Some of it can be made up for in gear (specifically the Hit) but that is wasted itemization.  Other parts like the glancing penalty can only be made up with weapon skill.  
---
In the same gear a Human will likely do at least 6%+ more dps.
---
Gnome is god tier for PvP warriors, that is for sure, but the dps from sword/mace skill is very high in vanilla terms (remember the highest dps vanilla warrior gloves are Edgemaster'a handguards).
---
Red = Dead
---
What is this
---
What happens when the game grinds to a halt in terms of PVE content?
---
I'm curious since many seemed concerned about what classic will be able to offer after all of the guilds have every phased release on farm.  
---
What would you do to keep the game going without gear + level creep?  Just PVP?  Not everyone like to PVP.
---
My main reason for even considering playing WoW Classic is because this release will bring us back to the original WoW design, but the game can't go on forever without something to keep people playing or there will be no one to play with as people log off due to nothing to progress through.
---
But their dances are the worst.
---
I’m really hopeful that it will be great. But if it’s not we can all go play another pserver!
---
Heard about vacation bro? 24/7 that is
---
Given the how Garrison worked in Warlords of Draenor. No.
---
But that massive February discount!
---
You can't trust alliance, guys. They will ALWAYS fuck you. KoS is the only way to be safe as Horde.
---
You and some others seem to completely misunderstood the meaning of '&lt;' and '&gt;' and basically the rest of my sentence then. Next time read before judging. And if someone asks you for an explanation try not to put yourself up on a shelf, because you're being the dick here.
---
A general rule says: Those who can't help themselves, aren't able to help others.
---
I didn't say be selfish, I didn't even suggest it. I said help yourself first OR if you can help yourself while helping others to do that.
---
It simply makes no sense to me that you guys downvoted me for such a simple and obvious logic. I could spectate this multiple times on Reddit and this Reddit especially already and I'm not even talking about my comments only. How comes that as soon as a few people misread/misjudge someone the rest follows like apes? I haven't said anything bad, rude or vulgar but when I ask for an explanation the only response I guess is being called names? Maybe think about if you're behaving as you should. If you're treating others as you want to be treated. Because you say "help others" like a white knight, but insult people you don't know for your own poor judgement.
---
I would love tbc after wow classic reaches a natural end, unless they release a new 60–70 exp based on classic gameplay
---
Hope they will provide a server list before the 13th so we can coordinate reserving names on the right servers (if that is still a thing?)
---
Im one of the few who just refuse to double gathering even if its so much more optimal. I just cant get away from thematic/RP of having a crafting prof at the start
---
Go hunter my man.
---
you guys are too bored
---
I wouldn't rely on NPC dialogue. Between the massive number of quests that have been retconned over the years, to things like an NPC in Grizzly Hills asking a Worgen player "if they've been bitten," the game's dialogue has been written around the constraints of it being an MMO. I don't doubt that the appearance of a mage and warrior is different, and would be brought up by some NPCs at a glance. But two lanky dudes wearing identical robes enter the room and you instantly know one's a practitioner of the dark arts and call him by that profession's title? That's a touch weird.
---
What am I getting at? You are the one writing a raid resume for no apparent reason
---
Just because you CAN doesn't mean you should. And I say this as someone who's struggled quite a bit with gaming addiction and letting gaming usurp more important aspects of life.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'll take my day of gaming when I can. But it becomes unhealthy when you see people like a guildie of mine, he played for 2 and a half days with only 4 hours of sleep throughout in order to try for realm first 60. (He got #2 on horde and I think #3 total)
---
Hey man, I'm starting to compile the people who responded to my PvE guild post. Could you shoot me a reply with your Class/Role desire, timezone and email.
---
Most of what you asked now we know.
---
Of course they will, because otherwise you wouldn't be able to have same names on different servers
---
nice work, i would phrase it different though. i have played wow before, just not retail.
---
For me it was when I got the Bonereavers edge off my first Rag kill while still in 90% blues. As a Arms warrior I could pop sweeping strikes and throw whirlwind + windfury. Would hit 8 people for 2k or something stupid, absolutely devastating.
---
And minimum is two?

Experienced Raider LFG with semi early raids ending by 10pm EST but preferably 9pm. Planning on making priest or shaman. Pst for more info :)
---
The drums of war thunder once again..
---
Warrior tank here.
---
Herbalism/Alchemy and First Aid.
---
Herbalism is a fairly easy gathering skill and only focusing on one gathering skill will make leveling less detrimental time wise.
---
Alchemy will help keep me alive so leveling goes faster. First aid will basically take care of itself since you get mats from kills.
---
Basically I'll only gather one skill, and the two professions will make leveling as a warrior easier.
---
My leveling partner is going tailoring so when I roll a mage I'll have access to a solid tailor and alchemist. Then my Mage is going to just be a gathering monkey.
---
I thought they were doing cross realm for bgs in classic like how it is in live?
---
I'm actually not sure.
---
I personally would prefer battle groups, but I also don't doubt them somehow gating battle groups for bg's n phase 6, either.
---
In classicwow time this is like posting news from last century :p
---
&gt;How do y'all think horde populations are going to be on PvE servers?
---
Tiny compared to Alliance on PvE and RP servers.
---
Not sure about the "best" overall, but for the three categories it is:
---
* Melee: Warrior
---
* Caster: Mage
---
* Healer: Priest
---
It always felt like every other Class design used them as the benchmark throughout Classic.
---
lol poor little fella.
---
Blizzard has already said Battlegrounds will be Cross-Realm in all of Classic from the moment they're released.
---
Don't really need a fancy mouse. 1 to 6, q, e, f, r, t. Then repeat with shift, and again with ctrl
---
Classic +
---
I wouldn't mind if they did it in such a way that wasn't stupid or easily abuseable.
---
compete with 7 others for gear vs not be invited at all  
---
its not exactly like that, but your chance at being invited should definitely be taken into consideration.  
---
a lot of shamans raid as healers in their ele spec, aside from maybe a few 'progression' weeks raiding as full resto isnt exactly needed  
---
"easy to cruise around the world" is just as easy, in some cases easier, with shaman and ghost wolf  
---
seems everything i wrote points to shaman, tho i'm not trying to point you in any direction. just wanted to make sure you considered those things.
---
I think for most people there won't be that much of a drop off in time. I will be playing the same on week 1 as week 8.
---
In german they are the default, my iPhone does that automatically (when using the german keyboard layout).
---
Cigarettes, Fruit and Iced Tea.
---
There is nothing you can do even if it has been changed to master looter. I don’t think ninjaing by masterlooting will be a common problem.
---
Some specs were not viable, like Protection Paladins, and that is not changing.
---
Knowing the twink economy is a pretty big advantage on a fresh server. Most people only know the basic blues but there's a few extremely valuable greens. Keep an eye out for leather 4/4 gloves and especially 3/3 bracers of the monkey/eagle.
---
Not really.
---
A Team Fight Tactics (TFT) loading screen. It's a game designed by riot games, same people that make league. Well, the public face of league at least.
---
People who got it quickly are also those who could work the AH... or happened to have a profession that fed into a highly desirable sellable resource (like copper bars could be stupidly overpriced for how easy they were to obtain as an example depending on the server)
---
Your forgetting that cured rugged hide CD once a day
---
Nubelraiben has the correct mindset and you sir are the dick. How do you help someone how is drowning while you are also drowning? Work on yourself and help others along the way.
---
Is it only German, I saw it in my German textbook but I hadn't seen quotation marks quite like that before.
---
Cool deal, I mean it's all nonsense but whatever helps you sleep at night. The average is that for a reason, there are some who are faster, but many will be slower. With a guide you would beat the average, and maybe land in the 7-8 day range. Normally playing you could expect 10. New players or those screwing around could see 15 or more easily. 
---
If joana was so bad, why did nobody beat that time? Seems to me like wishful thinking.
---
If you are curious about populations that will have to wait until the 13th. I believe that is when people get to reserve names and select a realm. Hopefully Blizzard releases that information. It will give the player base a good idea of what the populations will look like. However, I would not make your decision based on the hardcore player base, unless you fit into that group. Classic is more about finding out what works for you rather than making your decisions based on another select group of indidviduals. It will give you a more fufilling experience if you go with your gut and what you want to do rather than trying to mimic the top 1%. It sounds like you want to play Horde and I think you should stick with it. :)
---
that last bridge near the murlocs... a croc likes to hang out underneath it = guaranteed aggro when you run over the bridge
---
full blown Cross-Realm and Battlegroups are different.
---
But I'm all for it if its just battlegroups of servers.  Waiting for 2 hours for a BG to pop is not a "community feature" I am looking forward to, but neither is having your local server population be totally irrelevant like it is in retail.
---
At least when they put in battlegroups at the tail end of Vanilla and into TBC you still saw the same people for the most part (especially when twinking!).  And it built a lot of inter-server rivalries.
---
I'm of the opposite, I enjoyed building rivalries against people I'd meet whilst out doing professions or similar.

Just like bigdaddy said: Everything can work

You don't really need the loch FP until you're going to Badlands, and you could potentially have your mount when you do head there. Besides, it's a closer/safer run from IF to the loch.  It definitely saves time.
---
larger aggro radius because your low level
---
MMORNG.  RPG is long dead in BFA.  A glorified mount and dress-up collection simulator for people with compulsion disorders.
---
At 12 hours per week its 5 months. 12 hours per week might even be a stretch for people with kids.
---
This is more or less my plan as well. As a heads up for anyone curious, it will only add about 2 and a half hours to your leveling to grind fishing and cooking to 300. It will also provide high healing food so you spend less time between pulling mobs and clearing quests.
---
There are a couple of druid mana bar addons that were developed in the beta.  I didn't try a druid out so I don't know how accurate they are though.  But they use the new API so if the API was included later for seeing mana then they should be pretty accurate.

I played Horde side on a PVE server in vanilla. Our realms census was about 70-30 A:H But fluctuated depending on the time of day.
---
When classic comes if I were to roll Horde I will be going to a higher pop PVP server so groups are easier to come by.
---
I took launch week off from work and I can actually physically *feel* this post.
---
The people that think the launch will be delayed are as dense as they come.
---
&gt; wonder how hard it'll be to keep up with respec costs if I want to heal pve but ele in pvp 
---
Have no fear for  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEczVcMqZZEccz0ho](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEczVcMqZZEccz0ho)  is here! Ele/Resto Hybrid is one of the strongest specs in the entire game! Great for PvP! And good enough for dungeons and probably raiding.
---
Gearing up as a Shaman is ez pz.
---
&gt;  I really enjoy kiting 
---
Then pick a Shaman! Especially with the above build, it's all you'll be doing.
---
That‘s not how averages necessarily work out. While I agree it is plausible that the average L* player will be ahead of the average classic player, you are not accounting for a few very important aspects.
---
-	L* is heavily and intentionally overtuned
---
-	There are more people griefing
---
-	There is a very pronounced zerg with people all starting at the same time and not much influx of new players.
---
-	Zones on L* are super overcrowded. That is not such a big deal for you and me but those people driving averages up are struggling with this a lot!
---
-	you are not accounting for AFK time. It‘s a bit difficult to argue someone would hit 60 at 30 days played when your point is that they afk‘d for 20
---
Now the way these metrics show is not that the average is suddenly 50% higher. It shows in a different number of people hitting 60 and more giving up.
---
*Those that do hit 60* will probably end up at a similar average. It‘s not necessarily higher. Chances are it is lower.
---
Also it is more complicated than that. Much more... that average is not a constant. It evolves over time and keeps mostly rising. So the data that averages to 12 days does not translate to someone aiming to hit 60 in 3 months. That average starts at somewhere as low as 3 or so days (!) That is how low the average is when we have the world first level 60. It quickly bumps up to something as high as 6 or so days and only over a year or so gets above 10.
---
Seriously, I get where you are coming from. But I say when you claim 90% of people will take 15 days or more, *then you could not be further away from the truth*. At least your conclusions are not valid and you are making way too many assumptions.
---
In the end both of us are speculating. But with your initial comment you ended up hiding that important fact. Nobody simply knows what the average will be.
---
I guess the iPhone uses the quotation marks according to the default in the language. But long-pressing I can also choose others: »hello«
---
F, Orc, Shaman
---
yup, this belongs on this sub ^.
---
Heeey my bff! Are u eu based?
---
Retails rotations are pretty simple and they focus on making the fights difficult. Classics rotations are even simpler than retail and the fights aren't difficult.  
---
That being said difficulty alone doesn't make a great game and retails difficulty only starts to happen at the end of a game in mythic dungeons and raids.
---
Which is what happens when you play this game all day.
---
They have not announced anything, no.  But it is widely believed that we would basically login to the game and create a character.  Reserving the name otherwise would be a lot of effort since you would then have to be able to customize your look and such after.  We also don't know if name reservations will be available for a short window or up until launch day.
---
I appreciated  you adding Hunters needing weapons
---
cool thanks for that. Orc all they way although I just love the UD animations and lore
---
My calculation was assuming 60 seconds of uptime. I should have clarified that, not 60 seconds elapsed. Still, I will defend twisting all day, it will "allow" enhancement Shaman to be considered in raids. May I suggest that you try to realize that not everyone plays the way you do. A lot of returning players will want to try to play these spec and try to enjoy them. And, I appreciate your change of tone in the response. Look, no one likes to be talked down to. We all do our best at the end of the day. I have to say, I think the changes and suggestions that you have made, going down to Flurry and moving on to Resto: Something to consider for the next video. You have made some valid points. If you every want to reach out and discuss further, I'm open to it.
---
You're right, it's not new, and it's incredibly reductionist. If you were trying to actually be good at playing these specs rather than just playing casually for a little bit so you would feel better when you insulted them you'd see the more pronounced differences.
---
I am really looking forward to launch night.  I'll have grinded away for idk how long, and it will probably be getting late, but I'll be in the early teens and have a bunch of quests for RFC.  I'll find a group with a bunch of other people who are also up far too late, basking in the shared excitement, and we will probably take the run waaaaay too seriously.  It's gonna be a blast.
---
It's the 13th at 0000 gmt
---
Exactly what I was about to post. I didn't want to be in top 4 most common classes, but it seems like there will be quite a bit of competition for us priests.
---
I will do main on phase 1 and start an alt , but alt won’t be 60 until early/mid phase 2 (warrior) and might wanna raid on both 1 guild 1 pug then pick a main for real late game like past AQ 20
---
yup they already said they are doing BGs cross realm (so how it was back in 1.12). 
---
We just dont know how the battlegroups will be or even if there will be battlegroups.
---
It's possible it isn't very easy to implement back. I remember there being all kinds of problems with the original client and the spaghetticode they had with the bags. I think they had to remove keyring to be able to increase the size of the default backbag.
---
Gone in the wrong direction for years, despite people mostly loving the last expansion...
---
No it isn't going in the wrong direction, just a direction you don't like. Over the years they've been forced to make decisions that some people were going to be upset about. They always chose to upset the least amount of players but with a playerbase of millions that's hundreds of thousands getting upset whenever you make a decision. That's the only reason it seems like they haven't been making popular decisions is just because the minority is such a large number of people.
---
Definitely the "best" vanilla class.  So tempted to run mage but I love causing wpvp trouble so I can't live without stealth.
---
Thanks! Will build an iOS version in the future if people find it useful.
---
Not before AQ. You can easily heal anything up to that point. Starting at AQ Mana Tide becomes pretty important.
---
Edit; quite a bit of Hybrid Shammies run this build to much success on the Pservers. I doubt it'll be much different in Classic. You'll definitely at least be able to heal any 5, 10 and 20 mans without any issues. And should be completely fine up to AQ.
---
Eh, two weeks is about as long as BFA can hold my attention. Will give me time to sell off merch and get my gold stores reinflated for game time or, uh, “other” uses. &gt;.&gt;
---
Haha I chuckled at this. Stick with it for authenticity?
---
Was there a way to filter the responses before?
---
i.e. I want to see only responses from NA
---
Tzgolem was my second choice funnily enough...
---
As for stealth, it's quite easy to fit 5/5 points into the improved stealth talent as a druid, which is actually quite useful. I think 5 points increases your effective stealth level by 3, which makes sneaking past mobs much easier.
---
This is great - I'm a little confused and I apologize if I'm missing something, but why are you dividing the cleave/SS damage by 3?
---
MORE DOTS.
---
the stress test barrens chat was pretty damn close to the original
---
im not sure if thats impressive or sad considering you would expect the median age to be ~15 years more mature
---
Classic will be lumped in with Retail-full-heirloom-wearin'-twinks.
---
I think so.  I remember seeing names like Bo with the crossed out o.
---
Personally I felt proving grounds from MOP/ WoD were super fun and a good implementation of incremental endless content. I had a blast going for the all three titles on my paladin. It's also solo content though, so some classes were much harder than others. 
---
I think it could be cool to do something similar built around 3man.  It's nice because there are no gear rewards, just bragging rights.
---
Male human models look like they have a broom stuck upon their ass. This is the only (however valid) reason to select a female character.
---
Well that and private servers, as has been pointed out, don’t have everything perfectly accurate.
---
My guild has a goal of 60 in 3 months, which I think is reasonable, but it will be very close for me. I will try to play 20 hours a week, hopefully most of those will be fun! I never raided much in vanilla and was not part of a guild,  and I want the raid and guild experience.
---
As a counter to that point. The less tools you have, the less opportunity to do something different from someone else.  
---
What you just described is exactly what Skill Floors &amp; Ceilings are, but essentially backwards.  
---
Yes rogues/mages etc. have a lot of escape tools and thing they can do, this creates a high skill floor. Like you said, they have greater leeway for success. But, having only so many tools at your fingertips (i.e. how a warrior fights) your skill ceiling is much more limited. You can't do more, because you don't have additional options to create that gap between you and another warrior.  
---
But because those other classes have so many more options, the better someone is at managing all of them, the bigger the skill gap between an O.k. rogue and a great rogue. Where as the difference between say Monkeynews for instance and a regular warrior is far less.
---
Obviously engineering and trinkets etc. add to that for said warrior, but they also do the same for other classes. So it gives both parties even more options for different ways to attack a situation.
---
There aren't going to be enough servers to do Battlegroups. You're likely to only have one of each realm type (PVP, PVE, &amp; RP) for your Region/Language/Timezone.
---
Is everyone getting these off cursed when it comes out? I didn't know where to look for these at.
---
really the ridiculous strawman OP wasn't enough? you had to write your own strawman reply?
---
Nah, I'll take what I can't get
---
Mage has at least 6 viable specs. AP/frost, winters chill, or pve fire for raiding; deep frost, pom pyro or elemental for pvp.
---
&gt; "allow" enhancement Shaman to be considered in raids.
---
In a group of melee dps, his personal dps + all that he contributes will still be considerably less than just having another rogue or fury warrior.  
---
If an enhancement shaman has a place in a raid, it's probably with the MT group to give additional threat to the tanks.  That makes the most sense imo.   If enough people in the raid are threat capped, and the shaman can raise the threat cap by 4% or something, then he could hypothetically earn his raid spot. 
---
&gt; May I suggest that you try to realize that not everyone plays the way you do. A lot of returning players will want to try to play these spec and try to enjoy them.
---
May I suggest not telling people that 0/22/29 is the best shaman spec?
---
Normalizing for the cost of rend (10). Cleave costs 20, and I am assuming you are forfeiting about 10 rage from the auto you don't get. SS costs 30. So each costs you about 30 rage, so I divide by 3 to make it "per 10 rage". 
---
Honestly, these are real rough approximations though, as I discuss in the powerpoint. I think in real game situations, fully buffed, cleave will cost quite a bit more than 30 rage.
---
Some say that his sentence is still going to this day that one time he kept writing and writing but it was important because mad on the internet is a thing that he could talk about hey kiddo that's where you are wrong, memes
---
&gt;Wouldn't you be pissed off if they gave a mage item to a warrior?
---
Loot distribution has to be agreed on beforehand, so nobody gets "pissed off". Personally, if my guild decided that absolutely anyone can roll on \*any\* item, then I wouldn't be pissed off at all but I would be disappointed and leave the guild because we wouldn't make any progress in the future. I would respect their point of view.
---
&gt;Wouldn't you rather be able to do more damage because the tank has more  threat than give it to a rogue who will now have too much threat and be  doing less damage?
---
This is a complicated question. For me, classic will be also a numbers game but not primarily. Numbers come second, the gaming experience, sense of accomplishment and enjoying the content together with my friends comes first. If my guilds progression really depended on wheter our tank has TF or not, then ofcourse I would vote for MT to have it because we want to experience all the content. However, I think many guilds have cleared Naxx without TF so it's not going to be a literal gamechanger, so I think it'd be okay to be an exception to the otherwise sensible loot distribution agreement.
---
Mind control is like a 2 for 1 cc. Spriest grabs one mob and beats the shit out of another with it. Extra shackle is nice too. Take 1 shadow and 1 holy priest into Strath....suuuuuper easy. The extra AoE fear can be nice to have too. The extra stuns and passive healing is cool too as long as tank doesn't have problem holding aggro on multiple mobs.
---
I feel shaman is an enticing noob class, but has a lot of complexity to it with all the totems and inconsistency of wind fury (noobs love) when lvling will put people off. Shaman is my favorite class and I cannot stand leveling one until I’m able to respec elemental at 40 with a few dreamweave pieces. 1h shield is just painful and weird. Plus it sucks in wpvp but 2h windfury is also painful and weird.
---
That makes sense - I really appreciate the thought you've put into this, it is very helpful for me.
---
Mess with the bull, you get the horns. No, not that kind of horn.
---
and have shit gear and the struggle continues.
---
Human warlock LUL
---
Free mount, pet tank, and spam shadowbolt
---
Ha! I plan to roll on RPvP (come on, Blizz! Throw us a bone here!) so I'm afraid that won't fly. I dig it, though.
---
I plan on leveling mining/engi as I level. Access to headgear, trinkets, parachute cloak, etc while leveling is valuable. Not to mention grenades for winning wpvp fights. Considering the power boost from having engineering at lower levels, I doubt it even costs time.
---
At least it wasn’t a sheep...
---
Where was this taken ?

This is amazing x)

---
Essentially what Hulk said. Yeah, Scholo has some very good items. But by no means do you need Full Deathbone or even most of the items to go MT Molten Core.
---
BRD is an early gold mine for tank loot and it's significantly easier to tank across the board.
---
Also, don't fall into the trap that most tanks will, you do not. I repeat, do not, need Def Cap. I highly advise going to check out Skarm's youtube channel. He's got a great Pre-Bis option list and just great tank guidance material in general.
---
AutoModerator is a fucking joke.
---
First Rag pull. Was a crazy moment for me in vanilla, like nothing I’d ever experienced.
---
You get a free mount at 40.  You won't need to cheap out on training skills like other classes :)
---
Thanks for this I was super confused why I had it but my husband didn’t !
---
Great video and loving the content! only thing is it should have been 50g to respec :)
---
Do you know what the speed record for a warrior is?
---
oh god...
---
Hey thanks for the app, I like it ! I also got a question about a talent for Warriors "Blood Craze" (Fury tree); are the values really 2%, 6% and 12% ?
---
naughty bot
---
Get Annihilator and Nightfall.  Keep the stacks up along with your totems.  Good to go
---
I'll mostly be doing it to sell some choice things early on. I think people are underestimating the gold making potential of early professions while people are leveling.
---
I was mostly shocked by this. I think Blizzard is hoping that many people subbed these last few months, will sub for name reservation, etc. for a good representation of population before launch date. I feel they don’t realize they are about to awaken a sleeping giant and the launch day is going to be utter chaos.
---
Of course can't be changed anymore, but I would rather estimate gaming time per week, rather than per day
---
i've been complimentary to Rift (achieving success based on moderate achievable goals), but this was their biggest issue -- no backstory prior to release, and frankly some weak videos and introductions. 
---
in the end the story got better as you played, but coming into it cold it looked like 'generic fantasy 101', especially on the guardian side.
---
Planning to do alot of dungeon leveling, so ill probably have alot of downtime when im online alone and cba to quest/look for players.
---
I plan to use these quiet moments to level proffesions and calm down from the hype of playing classic wow.
---
No idea.  Seems like people are saying if you can get a really good group, best way for warrior to level is with a melee cleave group.  But I don't think that's reasonable for anything close to casual.
---
&gt;Paladins at 5.2%
---
whelp, I guess I won't have a lot of competition then, lol
---
I don't really believe it either also the amount of people claiming they quit in BFA versus the amount of posts/comments on this sub talking about how they haven't played since WOTLK/Cata is another red flag.
---
There is no cottage near the waterfall, but okay.
---
Not until I release the raw data, and I want to wait until there is a significant number of responses before doing so.
---
Sad about the reaction you got. Putting yourself out there takes courage. Keep at it!
---
Yep!  I'm gonna PM you my personal little spreadsheet for you to look at / download.
---
That's how it was on pservers, meet the recruiter in IF to let him inspect while doing a short "interview" on discord to make sure it's a good fit.
---
Hey i might be interested in joining your guild where are you guys based? When do you guys plan to raid within the first 3-4 weeks?
---
The worst is when you meet a guy of the opposing faction, and he seems cool, so you leave him be.
---
Then the hyperaggressive chinese UD mage comes in to gank you, and the aforementioned guy opportunistically jumps in to stun you as soon as he spots an easy kill.
---
Damn thats wild lol. 
---
Yeah, they remained a top guild in the world for a very very long time. I started in TBC they were top 5 or something I think, and they stayed in that echelon until until they decided to fold, around Cata I believe?
---
Not that deep into yet,  but I am already thoroughly impressed. Well done!
---
Good work. Block out all the haters!
---
Yeah this is the kind of thing I'm talking about.  Not much about WoW Classic needs to change, but it will need some form of endless content that can provide a rewarding experience + prestige for players without creating ridiculously out of control power creep + level creep like we are seeing in retail right now.  I'm glad that some previous form of this endless dungeon concept worked out for you!
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Thanks for the pointer to the other subreddit!
---
How the tables have turned!
---
Never heard of wet-aging your meat?
---
It still works, it just puts you in a different Dun Morogh graveyard.
---
I just listened to the interview with Kevin Jordan, and that was what he said. Frost and fire were good. Arcane was lacking. They didn't fix it because of technical issues with AM. Also, other classes were worse off. He also said that warrior was probably the most put together.
---
It would be nice to be able to choose a faction to filter everything by.
---
Other than that, thanks for the work you put in. I'm sure it will help a bunch of people.
---
Don’t scare me like that dude
---
retrowow you can play them and test them too . you will have access to all BIS blue gear
---
Haha I like your style. Though knowing me if I saw you out in the world I'd probably do a /wave then just see you gunning straight for me and just start sweating haha
---
To give some insight from the back then younger audience: I played vanilla when I was between 10-12 years old. Many of that age group (knew and befriended a few around my age) played on the account of a older sibling or parent. Still made it to 60 on my warrior and did a few pug runs of zg and aq20, but mainly 5 mans or UBRS. On my server all the guilds started raiding from 7-11 PM, therefore I couldn't raid 40 mans (wasn't allowed to stay up that late). This time I want to experience all the raids I missed back then.
---
Horde play pretty much exclusively on PvP servers cus we're not ~~pussies~~ ~~wimps~~ Alliance.
---
Gurubashi is already released.
---
There will be a raid spot for every class.   Hunters and druids will have the lowest amount of raid spots in a guild looking to min max.
---
i like how the guy who made this is a warlock.
---
vanilla warlock rotation.  curse, shadowbolts....(lifetap if oom)
---
Y’all are terrifying me. I’m an uncle to like 9 kids and clearly I’m about to die tomorrow.....
---
McDonald's burgers aren't halal. What makes them halal is the way the animals are killed and if they've had all the blood drained from the meat. Also none of the McDonald's I've been to say it's halal.
---
Just cuz it's not pork doesn't mean it's halal
---
Paladin seemed like the worst. Designed for all the roles, but could really only do one well.
---
I mean... if you found yourself needing an extra escape and you’ve blown all CDs and you jump and lol at your male rogue friend who also has all CDs spent... probably would be worth it at that point for the laughs
---
Damn crazy it’s almost spot on 50/50 split with US and EU on this reddit
---
nope, I think many of the newer combos are silly
---
As someone who has been playing a lot of frost until 8.2, this "rotation" is largely nonsense because the person has picked every talent that operates a "choice" to create the illusion it exists. A specific azerite essence. Nobody takes ice nova. Nobody picks mirror image for example. Ever. Rune of power is bad for frost.
---
I spammed frostbolt with rng flurry until you get 5 combo points, then glacial spike. Over and over again. Orb + Blizzard on AoE. Ice lance whenever you have fingers of frost. Zzzz. 
---
When people talk about homogenised gameplay, the builder/spender formats being so prevalent with every class having their own versions and AoE is what they're talking about. I am not one of the people that says classic = always better, but playing a different class did FEEL like playing a different class which is something they need to work on.
---
They can have complexity without homogeneity, like Fire. Fire is fun in 8.2. They have got that right. There is a balance between cooldowns "make things explode" and a nice feedback-reactive loop with your rotation depending on your crits. It feels like how "fire" should, if that makes sense.
---
Arcane is the ginger stepchild at this point, just completely forgotten.
---
Looks like I was wrong and it's more plausible than I thought.  It's crazy he lowered it by a day!  With guilds boosting a player with gold, gear and consumables we're gonna see some disgusting 1-60 times

&gt;I'm going to have 2 alts to farm gold and do dailies
---
This is a perfectly comprehensible sentence in WOW for over a decade. It refers to the practice of having more than one max level character to run the max level daily quests for additional raw gold.
---
the thing is you didn't mean:
---
&gt;I'm going to have alts to stack profession cd's
---
You said "farm gold and do dailies". profession alts are lvl 35 and they neither "farm gold" nor "do dailies". Every 48 hrs you can transmute arcanite. Every 72 hours you can shake salt. Neither of those are "daily"

I'm not bummed out but it at all. I know retail is ever there if I ever had the desire for a certain race/class combo but I'm fine with the restrictions
---
Love it
---
Yes, but mistakes on classic launch will have more consequences than retail expansion or other games like overwatch or diablo or poe launch
---
Because after they remove layering, even a moderate error (+- 30%) can lead to drastically different realm populations and may require additional measures like transfers to new servers, etc
---
Thanks for your comment! At first, I wanted to do this, but I preferred to make it simpler by adding clearly visible colored tags. Plus, I must admit that it is also easier to maintain.
---
This also applies to the content per game phase. At the beginning, I had completely divided the site by phases, to finally merge everything and just add columns.

i think its safe to say the engine has been under development for 5 years, but the game itself probably has accelerated in the last 2-2.5 years.

Check out the blizzcon 2018 panel.
---
Arena was not in Vanilla Bud.
---
Best Class is Warrior
---
But best *designed* class overall has to be Mage. They never see an identity crisis, and are fully fleshed out, especially in comparison to the other classes. Completely viable start to finish in 5 mans, 10 mans, 20 mans, 40 mans, leveling, BG's/premades, Open World PvP, and pretty much every facet of the game in general. Strong damage, decent mobility, tankier than you'd think, good utility, efficient, and easy to play.
---
Worst designed class is Paladin, because they are the literal example of an identity crisis, start to finish, nearly broken and unplayable. A 100% completely broken and unplayable Prot spec that is missing the core components necessary for tanking (Taunt, Mana, Gear?). And a 95% broken and nearly unplayable Ret spec that just sucks. Luckily for them, their deep Holy spec is *very* strong, especially when itemized with cloth priest gear. By Naxx, Blizzard realizes that Holy is the only viable Pally spec, so all of Pally T3 is Int+SP pretty much, admitting that they kind of fucked that class up in Vanilla. Obviously this all gets addressed in TBC but until then...? Pallys for sure.
---
Shamans are decently close second.
---
That's what I did and will continiue to do.
---
Cheers, thanks
---
No rush
---
Haha this is too true. Not to push people away from the class because it’s extremely satisfying and rewarding to play well, but.... I would probably advise most people unfamiliar with the class to consider leveling a Druid alt instead of as their first character. The leveling portion of the game is so much fun as a Druid and you definitely feel super strong all the way up to 60. Then you get a bit outclassed if you don’t put in the work and adjust your play style.
---
Apologies, been going through lots of names in the recruitment game. Didnt notice the OP name... I will talk with our officers and see what they think. I am guessing that slight inconvenience will make it difficult. Seems a shame that 10 minutes should make or break this.

It might be best for you to go Tailoring/Mining and save all Mining mats until 60 (mail them to an alt and let them sit in your mailbox for free storage). Trying to level up Engineering as you go can be tedious and expensive, and many would probably agree that it would only slow you down.
---
Fish at work
---
What is this supposed to be? A class guide for modern wow? Go post it on r/wow. This has nothing to do with classic...
---
All classes were viable, some specs are not viable in raiding.
---
Every spec is viable in world content/leveling/PvP however.
---
Isnt the first respec 1g??
---
Unfortunately, this does not work well, otherwise we would have seen examples
---
The only place where it *somewhat* works are TCG/CCG. And even they have to introduce formats where not all cards are playable, and make those formats mainstream. Otherwise any new addition will introduce less and less to the game, to the point that it becomes pointless
---
The better way is to *powercreep slowly*, not retail-like where everyone scrap 90% of their gear within first 2 weeks of a new patch
---
I will only miss troll warlocks.
---
It just fits them imo.
---
Sick! Thanks for this
---
Is there a discord or something for the rp-pvp community to congregate?
---
Aaah, my bad :D it was hillarious that he quoted him self
---
Yeah but neither is this guy. The OP is not only not classic related, it's not even informed enough to be considered wow-related at all...
---
That's a huge reason why I want to have a profession that will yield items to sell on the AH (like spider silk boots) or other items that are useful to people along the way.
---
Good luck following that guide. This isn't an empty private server we're talking about.
---
Any interest in weekend raids? Our times are 12-3pm sat / sun
---
Blizzard doesn't care if you assume the worst. It's not going to change you playing the game whenever it launches.
---
I feel sick every time I see "rouge", if you were in my group I'd get ptsd.
---
3rd world problem, my dude.
---
Wait, what happened to sunder #5 at level 22? Why is the value halved?
---
Grinding actually. Going to an area and grinding out money and items. Devoting time to getting that one enchanting recipe, or those mats for that one weapon....gold for mounts. Just grinding away and feeling accomplished.
---
Yeap, there is a huge difference between leaving a comment on thread that appear on your front page than going out of your way and make a thread to whine
---
This is interesting.  How did you calculate the damage per 10 rage for sunders?
---
Also wouldn't this often be context dependent?  Thunder Clap may be more efficient than cleave if you have 4 mobs, but cleave should be far more efficient if you only have 2.
---
It follows the same format as: Showerthought
---
It's just someone's opinion jazzed up with reddit-speak because they're unoriginal.
---
I wish I had the option to do this. I could bring my laptop to work to do that during lunch but that would be about it. Perhaps during the winter months when I take the bus to work (I bike to/from work spring-fall) I can do that to/from home.
---
Point taken
---
So you're not gonna play classic if blizzard ignores you until release? Oh you'll play either way?  Great
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/supposably-vs-supposedly
---
You must feel smart now.
---
Or they could manage their mana the way every other class does. What's wrong with that?
---
Read and think?
---
I dig the soundtrack
---
Man, I wasn't going to do it, but the hype got me so I'm roughly sketching out a leveling route to make sure I hit my fave zones. Last I put it down, I'm having a visceral flashback to how many times you leave the Barrens and hit Stonetalon or Ashenvale, then slide right back to the Barrens, and back. Gonna try to integrate Silverpine this time, too. Hell, give me some lacking efficiency/bulk green turn-ins, idc, it'll just be fun to see more of the world. Sorry, now I'm rambling, lol
---
I think best is a bit subjective, but worst is clearly, imo, the hybrids. 
---
Pala/Druid/Shm all have alot of design problems, the biggest being only having 1 viable role/spec in endgame pve (with an exception for bears)
---
It's crap to bait people into thinking they'll be swinging a sword as a paladin, meleeing or casting nukes as shaman, or casting nukes as a druid..........then they all just end up having to heal. 
---
It was a bait and switch back in the day, and I fell for it on shaman. I was not happy.
---
Y should be Yggdrasill
---
I'd rather them be fixing issues than stress testing the servers more. The last stress test closed 8 servers within the first hour because of low load.
---
It folded a lot longer ago than that. They ended during BC. At least, the main word class guild that they were did. I remember during Vanilla when they’d be running around in the original Naxx tier. They were godlike. Haha
---
You're pretty delusional if that's your solution. TBC is hailed as one of the greatest wow expansions of the series. It is different, it diminished world PvP and interaction, while simeotaneously bringing some of the best class balance (without homogenization) we've ever known. It brought us accessible but fixed raids and loot, far different than the cancerous retail you speak of.
---
TBC has every right to exist and will be insanely popular, potentially the most popular of the hailed "trilogy" (vanilla TBC wrath). I'd follow some of your logic at the wrath level (while still respecting why it's amazing) but definitely cataclysm point.
---
&gt; atleast 3 months to get to 60
---
This will be the norm/average
---
I suspect they are highly under estimating the amount of people that will be there on launch.
---
The "...something we haven't done in almost 15 years." is what sticks out to me.  Software launches and hardware launches are two very different things.  With this and Blizzard's track record in mind I'm highly doubting a smooth launch experience.
---
False dichotomy. Many (dare I say most) of the people who hit level 60 in a single week do not hold a job to take time off of. Or they kind of do, but taking time off of WoW would be counterproductive to being the best at their job.
---
I mean, you're entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong ;)
---
Is anyone not planning to do this?
---
Ya, roughly. I hear they have little to no upgrades in AQ40, and by naxx they are hugely behind the dps of mage/war/rog
---
That’s a sick name (:
---
Damn, loppy is brutal.
---
Part of me is terrified that Barren's chat becomes a mirror of Twitch chat.  Pure cringe.
---
It's not wrong. Leveling is meaningless to me. Get me to 60 so I can start having fun.
---
hard to know
---
I'm just hoping Captain Placeholder makes another appearance
---
Hey you stealin my picture &gt;:(
---
Radio silence is fine. Saying “this is not fine” would be something to be alarmed about.
---
so a true classic launch experience
---
it is i just find the 50g respec funny
---
Or you know, you do you boo and let people play how they want? Why are people so insistent on telling others how they should play a game.
---
Uh, that's how they managed their mana on long fights. It was the hunter equivalent of channeling evocation, or spending several GCDs life tapping.
---
Good work. I have to agree with the last slide also. If you follow Kargos' last stream, he made the same point that the 5-man melee grind is easy and chill (even before cleave). 
---
I was going with a feral druid tank (+ 3xWar, Pala), but if everyone is spamming sunder, not sure how useful that's going to be. Maybe this makes rogue as the fifth man more viable as they benefit most from sunder?
---
I also don't know what kind of delay there is when deleting a name until when you can use it again.  I imagine people will be somehow scripting name snipers, but maybe that's just my paranoia.  
---
My concern is that the reserved names won't be released during the reservation period, and you'll have to wait until launch to actually get your real character made.
---
There was a survey posted recently asking questions like this, most people (of 2100ish answers) are over 18
---
You want a good classic challenge? After running out of content in vanilla, try doing raids with less and less people. You can look up people doing 5 man onyxia in vanilla, speed raid clears that guilds would compete in, 2 manning strat live. The thing about vanilla is that it leaves a ton of room for players to get creative in how they enjoy the game. It’s more sandboxy than its retail counterpart where everything’s already dictated for you, and that’s a part of what people love so much about it
---
Could be that you got flagged on your account to get it, but never actually got it?
---
Depends on where you live.
---
The captain of our hearts!
---
I dont think you do. I think you want people to play how you think is fun.
---
My understanding is any grey item can always be traded.  So, the best enchant possible for the phase that could be used on a grey item is what you're looking for.
---
I'd take grey cloth boots with movement speed on them for any starting character.  It may be possible you could put stam and spell power librams on grey shoulders but idk.
---
Maybe a grey broom with fiery for 2h melee.  If it fails you still have a sick bank toon weapon.
---
Doing the hunter epic quest again.  My goal was to complete each one the first time I spawned them and I did last time.
---
I remembered farming all the tubers, and all the other prep work.
---
I remember having about 10 guildies watching me do two of them, lots of pressure after how much I talked up doing it.  The hardest one, in silithus, I remember dueling a warlock, and having him cast level one recklessness i think it was, so i couldnt be feared.  I was reported by another guild and subsequently exonerated, that it was not cheating by blizzard.  Good times.  Will be fun again.

I have a strong suspicion that Classic will launch with very few servers, like one each of PvP, PvE and RP. These will function as megaservers for the whole region until phase 1 is over and layering has to go, then they open up the real permanent realms and give everyone free transfers to them.
---
Exactly this.
---
In the US its a game, people pick sides and try to get their sides to win lol. Everything is a debate in the US, black vs white, right vs left, socialism vs capitalism, gay vs straight, religious vs atheist. Every single thing is turned into a 2 sided debate and for some reason you have to pick a side and hate the other side.
---
It most certainly is!
---
Vanilla through CATA I was a Horde member and did it cause of the "cool" and "edgy"(spikey) nature of the Horde. Loved it, but I'm an elf lover by nature, and I like the Alliance cities looking more "nice" than rugged.
---
So I'm gonna experience the Alliance side and use my knowledge of the Horde side against them!
---
There's no way there won't be launch day hardware issues.  Not a day you want to be Blizz support.  I expect a stable but scetchy launch with a flurry of patches in the first couple weeks.
---
Not in the EU, we dont care about Bush or Trump, only time the US presidents are brought up on EU servers is to make fun of them :D
---
The ignorance is strong with you. There has been a general statement and I replied in a general way. Now that you see that you are wrong (which is why you completely ignore every point I made) you're trying to lead the topic somewhere else. You are pathetic.
---
Nah that’s not correct. Wowhead doesn’t have everything corrected yet.
---
Not in the EU, cause you know, we play the game :D
---
&gt; You could theoretically average 10 hours per day while working a full time job and not sacrificing too much sleep.
---
Theoretically, but I'd say not realistically.
---
Let's assume someone works a 9-5 and has a 30 minute commute.  They could roughly play between 6pm and 8am each day, or 14 hours.  To get in 10 hours, they would have to be getting less than 5 hours of sleep per night, and that still leaves absolutely no time for meals, hygiene, and other misc stuff.
---
I think realistically if you wanted to cram in every possible minute of WoW while holding down a full time job, you could play from 6pm to around 1am each night, sleep from 1am until ~8am, then get up shower and get to work.  That gives you 7 hours of sleep per night which is low, but livable.  If you're willing to have all meals on-the-go, you could sustainably pull off 7 hours per day through the week, if you let your life revolve around WoW.
---
Yes can't train until level 5.
---
Can't reach 300 without being 35.
---
Yeah I suspect many of the players that just show up and make a random character won't be the type that make it all the way to 60 - at least the class that randomly selected. Most of the people I know as well as myself rerolled more than once my first go before I found the class I liked and made it to end game.
---
Doing basic math is revolutionary?
---
&gt; C is for Casters, the magic based Classes, and Casual players who will never see Naxx.
---
Unless someone is really stretching hard to make NAX-US
---
Haha makes sense, just like me! I voted Phase 2 because of Thunderfury.. then had to notice BWL is Phase 3 and now I'm crying.
---
Play on PVE server then
---
40 is required for all specializations, at least lw and BS not sure about engi.
---
It certainly makes warlock a lot worse. If a warlock is doing 10% of your dps to every mob, that makes every sunder 10% worse.
---
I do think that rogue is one of the big winners. A rogue doing damage to your sundered mobs actually hurts the rage generation of the warriors (As you make more rage autoattacking sundered mobs).
---
But a guy to interrupt casters, hit mobs that were never going to be sundered anyways, and kill normal mobs (which are not viable to sunder at all) is not useless.
---
the biggest problem is how they get into fights. Wariors want to repeatedly drop combat and charge. Rogue wants to pull the fight into the next pull because he has no charge and sprint's cooldown is ugly. 
---
Overal, I feel like as long as you have a priest and some warriors, you can honestly make it work with any 5th member. It is much BETTER if you have them do physical dps, but hell. you want to bring a mage? If your group is okay with it, give it a try. Schedule synchronization is going to be the limiting factor here.
---
Hell, I just out of curiosity looked at the lfg sticky yesterday.... there were people wanting to do a 30+ hour launch session and then run 20/4 days until 60.
---
Now, I am hardcore enough to make spreadsheets. I am not THAT hardcore. It doesn't matter if that is the perfect group possible for me, I am still going to pick like 2 warriors, a warlock, and a priest that actually let me sleep 8 hours a night.
---
Omegalul- it's going to have server outages 100% - BFA had a couple servers down for an entire day when it launched. 
---
Just gotta roll the dice and hope blizzard is on top of it monday night.
---
It’s a horde name!!
---
With set lists for every spec it’s going to be very easy to pull off.
---
Some people literally work everyday for 8+ hours on the computer, and thats not even playing games
---
It's not August, relax - read a book :)
---
I'll be leveling all 3 healers of my faction.
---
I appreciate the entertaining music choices
---
Yeah napkin math is currently showing Shaman as 2nd most populated class Horde side.
---
The female dwarves have great cast animations, too. 
---
I think I’m going human for the reputation bonus and the aesthetics of amour on a larger character model. Sucks that I’ll miss out on fear ward (not to mention cast animations) but it’ll help with enchanting reputation grinds.
---
It has always been Lv35, what makes you believe it's 40?
---
So you see defcamp as identical to people like asmongold, pewdiepie, and jake Paul? Don’t think their many class guides and in depth dives separate them from the bunch??
---
Downgrading weapon is definitely the wrong way to adjust for attack speed buff.  Only way to correct for it using the same server is to just NOT spec into flurry and assume 100% uptime.  Weapon damage and attack speed scale completely differently, damage is practically just a flat -attack power mod, while haste scales all his other abilities .  Dual 30% haste buffs is INSANE and the numbers he generated are nonsense
---
That’s why it will be even more convincing when I hide my pet pig among the ones in Durorar..
---
If i remember correctly you only needed to get to 35 then you could level crafting professions up to 300. Of course though if you wanted to get a recipe tat was rep gated you would have to level and grind rep. I plan getting n eventually lvling  three alts to 35 with tailoring and have them producing mooncluth for my main.
---
How can you despise Loch Perfection?
---
Not an option
---
Im getting my name + the names of my 2 most hated streamers so i dont have to face them
---
&gt; If people are still arguing politics on barrens chat in a month, then thats Nochanges right there in a nutshell.
---
So what you're saying is we kinda have a responsibility to light that fire.
---
Different use cases. this is for groups with primarily physical dps: so multiple warriors. This stuff does not apply when the group's dps is mostly nonphysical (you could modify the spreadsheet quite easily by changing the yellow column, but I can already tell you what the results would be).
---
I will note, a good part of WHY I like sunder is that if warriors are sundering mobs for other warriors to hit, everyone makes a lot more rage. Autoattacks on sundered mobs are just way more rage, and autoattacks are most of your rage generation as a warrior anyways.
---
For max skill yes to do any specialization quest it’s 40, well at least for lw and BS not sure about engi.
---
Red is dead bitch. Bring it on. FTA
---
It's funny actually, when leveling before I always kind of left people alone to do their own thing, but I think this time around... I'm attacking everyone I see
---
I don’t think you realize how companies work. If they find that there is money in expanding the game to finish up unfinished content that stays true to the things that make Classic great, then they will do it.
---
You good fam. One day at a time. Cherish it all. Time is money friend.
---
my gnome bank alts always have lush well styled hair , tyvm!
---
You can go up outside of Gnomeregan. I tested that route in the Beta but I'm not sure. You miss out on the Loch Modan FP and have to get that one later, which kinda sucks. You will still save time but later on you will have to walk the way through Dun Morogh again.
---
That is not a tip.
---
lmfao
---
This is where it's nice being UD, that cannibalize is real nice, especially early on.
---
To be fair, he has evidence. We have a statement from a dev that has no real basis, as we haven't played the game to confirm his word.
---
Yea, only to AQ during Vanilla, then 6 years of vanilla private servers, getting a couple server firsts in BWL/AQ and Naxx.
---
For Dungeons you want 1 mage, 3 Warriors and a Healer.
---
Heck basically up to AQ you want 2 mages and 1 Warlock in the raid, the rest you stack with Melees.
---
Does it matter? The answer real answer here is that any client that can currently be installed isn't the Live client which is coming soon.
---
Same.
---
You can walk through the alliance fence above tunnel as female human which is why people used to go female human on pservers.
---
Classic wow is Halal !
---
In dungeons, yes, sadly. 
---
The private server people and the retail hardcore's are gonna shit on players, new or otherwise, that can't or won't match their desired pace in dungeons. I don't think these will make up a large number of players thankfully. 
---
Just leave if they are assholes. Unless they have a lock with them, it will waste alot of their time to replace you.
---
Dodge affect all class in the same way, maybe it's harsher for warrior because they get less rage.
---

Well you’d best not roll a pvp server or I’m coming for you and your piggy...
---
&gt; on the backend it shouldn't be too difficult to just add a "hidden" bag that appears once you get a certain item.
---
haha
---
Ion said thats out of the question atm
---
im not saying it will never happen but BC is much more likely
---
I agree. I hope it's massive to really drive the point home that the new version &amp; current expansions are wack.
---
I have 4 IRL friends who haven't played since BC/WOTLK who will be restarting on classic.
---
You bring up a good point, I wonder how many people will try to also grab streamer names to keep people off their server
---
If I hit 60 within 2-4 weeks I wont be bored.
---
I'll be: grinding for epic mount, maxing out professions and weapon skills on my warrior, grinding rep, farming for gold.
---
I'll also probably level an alt to 60 before most people have their first level 60.
---
And then max out their professions and grind rep while starting to run for pre-bis gear.
---
Then once two 60s are mostly set I'm gonna sit around low level areas and harass people going for mining nodes.
---
Gonna take my time and make my toon as I want. If main name is taken, I have back ups.

---
\*\*Raid Times:\*\* Tues, Weds 9pm - 12am ET
---
\*\*Goals:\*\* Rekindle our romance with Vanilla by forming a close knit, active family of gamers. We will be focusing on raiding content as it's released, clearing content in a respectable manner, being one of the top guilds on our server. Beyond raiding we will be doing plenty of World PvP and pre-made BGs; if it's red, it's dead! We will choose a high-pop NON-STREAMER server.
---
\*\*Sup?:\*\* We have \*\*vast experience in Vanilla raiding or obtained Rank 12+ in PvP\*\*. We also have members that are just looking for an active and friendly community to call home and that's what we offer. \*\*We are very active, chatting throughout the day and night, playing on beta or private servers, honing out our skills and learning to play with one another while we wait for launch.\*\* We are a large family, just like Vanilla, where everyone works together for the common good, and everyone knows everyone. \*\*We just launched OUR OWN PRIVATE SERVER to practice endgame content prior to Classic launch!\*\*
---
\*\*Needs:\*\* We're looking for exceptional, experienced Vanilla raiders. Social members looking for a family. PvPers looking to grind Honor. Players that want to be part of a large, successful organization.
---
Raid Needs:
---
Druid (Resto): Low
---
Hunter: Low
---
Mage: Low
---
Priest (Holy): Low
---
Rogue: HIGH

\*\*About Nevermore:\*\* We are a large org with \~2,100 members in our main org Discord. This is our brand new private WoW Classic Discord. We're seasoned gamers in our 30's and 40's, though we do have a handful of younger gamers with us. We know what it takes to get the job done in Classic and we're willing to put in the time and effort. We're looking for like minded Guildies. Come join our family.

It's funny, when I raided back in the day on my rogue, combat daggers was the norm. People didn't switch to swords till Chromatic sword in late BWL. 
---
Apparently, going swords right away is better. I'm not sure if a patch changed that, or if I was just bad/dumb back then.
---
You can farm that stuff starting in phase 1.
---
This is actually a big concern of mine.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if they offer realm transfers if you happen to end up on a server that's dead. But not right away. That's the entire point. IT'll be feature once the hype dies down.
---
Just don’t step into a trap 😉
---
I read that on retail even after you delete your character the name still is locked to your account for a period of time before it opens up to anyone. If that's the case here then there's no issues deleting and remaking.
---
grey items cant be enchanted. so the free trading is of no use here. 
---
But lots of white items can be enchanted, so we can use those
---
Cat form is 30% faster than mage, bear has charge, trav form, and each shift takes off snare/root.  Good luck kiting long nuff to make it an attrition war, and if you do they'll just turn around and run off for a stealth/pounce when you sit to drink after.

---
Rp realm huh?
---
You spin me around right around
---
I would like some more info on your methodology. How did you calculate damage/rage of sunder armor? Specifically, how much health did you assume the mob had? Generally I would just like to see your math. 
---
And did you take into account the wasted rage generation with cleave? Using cleave robs you of one white hit.
---
Perhaps for more than 41 years, though.
---
*cries in warrior*
---
Yeah there will be an armory no matter what. 
---
Realmplayers does it on private servers from people using their client and an addon to upload data. Here is my Shaman. I've never used the addon or the client.
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=407052
---
I haven't had an active subscription since early legion and I have the option to install classic.
---
1-75 = level 5
---
76-150 = level 10
---
151-255 = level 20
---
255-300 = level 35
---
Slam warriors in classic have a complicated rotation. You need to slam between swing timers while making sure you dump enough rage. That's quite a lot of fun. it's not an optimal spec but out dps almost every other spec.
---
It's quite good paired with demonic rune if you're a hunter, mage, priest, or shaman.
---
Next time try "Hey, how are you guys doing today?"
---
Your friend was actually correct. I re-played Rogue recently on a private server and it was so fucking miserable that I also never used stealth.  
---
You need to understand that without the extra stealth levels from Master of Deception and without the extra movement speed from Nightstalker or whatever, you move at 40% movement speed in rank1 stealth and mobs could see you from far away (like 10+ yards). Behind was better, but mobs may 180 randomly and pull you out.  
---
Ambush/backstab are only usable with daggers, and rogues tend to level as combat swords. Even back then, it was known to level as combat with a slower weapon.  
---
Garrote's okay, but required behind the target and same problems as before.  
---
And cheap shot isn't learned until like lv34 or so.  
---
Basically pulling monsters with thrown weapons is correct as a leveling rogue unless you're punishing yourself and leveling as sub, in which case stealth becomes correct at level 16 when you get ambush and have 5/5 MoD
---
Please God no
---
&gt;In structured PVE it's not as handy because you rarely take damage 
---

It's significant because you can blanket the entire BG with it in seconds from 36 yards out for almost no mana. 
---
Mortal strike is obviously better, but will most likely NEVER be on more than one target.
---
In organized BG's, being able to knock 20% off every heal is very very strong.

This entirely depends on your opponent being poor enough to not farm jungle remedy.

You will almost never encounter this situation in premade BGs.

Can confirm, was caught in an honorbuddy ban wave and was banned for 6 months, not even a perma ban.
---
Great stuff!
---
I sure hope the people of Westfall appreciate my heroic sacrifice!
---
If I remember right, enchanting items in classic binds them to the character, aka untradeable. Someone let me know if I'm remembering it wrong.
---
Aaaaand downvote.
---
Solid name 5/7
---
hey now you will have corruption to watch for since the debuff slots are 16 out of the gate
---
I just want to reach level 60. Was unable to do that in vanilla.
---
People are just super biased based on their own personal preference.
---
I like Undead better, I think they look better, I think Undead female priests are sick from a lore standpoint, but I will still be rolling troll because it's just that much better.
---
I am going to do what I want and have fun doing it.
---
Yes for all of them.
---
I'll make a note and go back to this thread with an update!
---
Huge. So many memories in WoW. We all really play one of the greatest games.
---
100%. I think something like 8% of alliance roll warlock because undead are a thing anyways.
---
&gt; You'd probably have the arathi fp

That's Hammerfall, ya dingus.

You use it with mana burn, and if you go into improved mana burn, it's DISGUSTING.

---
A lot of guilds won't allow corruption in the spot.  Especially when the mages use fire
---
Thanks! just randomly thought of it today
---
This is awesome!!!!
---
To be honest I was insanely hype for Classic a while back and was checking the sub hourly. But things have been happening in my life and I have got really tied up.
---
Since being out of the community I've started to question a lot of my assumptions about the popularity there will be. My own interest has waned as I've been away and I realise now that maybe I don't actually have the time to invest in WoW that really it does demand.
---
Yeah we all have treasured memories, but the amount of people who can tank time into a game like classic, who were also around to play the original, who aren't interested in other games, who are still feeling the nostalgia, who are willing to pay for it, who have even heard about it etc etc, might not be as high as one would expect if you are immersed within the community.
---
I'm really hoping that the game will exceed expectations but I wouldn't bank on it. I firmly believe that when Classic is released it will be the best MMORPG so I hope with accessibility and support it will be a great solid game. But that doesn't mean everyone is going to drop what they are doing and flock to it.
---
I'm hoping this is mistaken. But I'd also rather blizzard got a pleasant surprise than view the release of the world's best MMO as a flop.
---
Sorry, it's been like seven years. Surprised I still know half the zones tbh
---
No Thunderfury line. Disappointing.
---
Not all classes can wear it though, so you'd have to be tricky with it. 
---
For example, +35 agility to a white level 15 2h staff would be great for druid/sham/warr/hunter but rogues would scoff at it, and casters wouldn't like it much either. 
---
Any armor would have to be cloth, or anything for a weapon-damage class would have to be leather
---
I wonder what the most effective single piece of gear would be.  I'm kind of thinking a +35 agility staff would be bonkers for any weapon-damage class, similarly that +22int would be for a caster. 
---
Maybe a +9stam cloth bracer would be most potentially useful to all classes, or put one of the Zul-Gurub head/shoulder enchants on a white piece.  Though that would be a hell of an investment!
---
Oh, the quests.  That's interesting.
---
You're mistaken if you think it would drive that point home.  You might want to take some courses on argumentation and statistics.
---
I'm only going to be logging into my streamer named character to collect free stuff that was sent to it. Appearance means nothing to me.
---
Dungeon grinding isn't faster than questing - if you are on a pvp server it should be in some level brackets.
---
I learned how to calculate probability from the Rivendare's Deathcharger comment section.
---
Wow thanks so much for your thoughtful contribution to this discussion.
---
I also enjoy the feeling of entering the back.
---
Sounds good, not like the beta is just that, a beta. A non final build of a game they hadn't finished yet. You have fun in your fantasyland where you are going to kill the best time by a day and every idiot who watches a leveling video is going to get sub 6 days played.
---
its no cast time, 3min, 40%HP for max effect, with a mana cost.
---
Even if they have to guess addons will track the tick rate and exact spirit and mp5 so they will be 100% accurate.
---
Dont go I have so many questions
---
It's going to be the same time as launch night 3pm pdt.
---
yeah but at least people like that/me can put it down and pick it back up in a few weeks/months and resume the same game.
---
&gt; it literally is a single player game
---
This word still doesn't mean what you think it means.  
---
&gt; I’m sure you started in cata  
---
bro you were obviously born during cata
---
This is the classic wow sub fyi.
---
I mean in theory if they had to they could use alt codes for their names if the server happens to be the one they all decide to live on.
---
You wont be getting benediction unless you're the raid leader or best buddies with the loot master in your guild.
---
May as well add in Scholomance since Chillwind Camp is basically right there and not long of a flight from Ironforge.
---
80% of UD casters are going to go with the Vurtne "mad scientist" hair.
---
Sorry I was thinking circle of healing in BC
---
Legion was great, and I basically never did world quests. Everything you mentioned can be obtained from farming mythic+ which is the only good aspect of current wow.
---
Need ap? Do m+
---
Need legendary? Do m+
---
It’s very clear you didn’t play the expansion so what’s with all the ignorant hate in this sub?
---
I enjoy mythic+, still do. It’s the only thing I log into retail for. What’s the big deal?
---
It's a joke from the Simpson's.....
---
I don't mind this honestly.
---
I always thought it was Falcorn.
---
I don't really know what motivates you give me this answer.
---
Neither is it funny, nor is it helpful.
---
It is pretty coincidental that you bring up sharding in retail.  One of the tenants of sharding was to bring people from underpopulated servers, into the world with other players from underpopulated servers.  When wow launched, the company turned on every backup server and ordered as many pieces of server hardware from their vendor to supply the demand they had.  Then in the long term, this ended up back firing because too many realms were open and the supply was vastly larger than the demand.  The point being that when the company leverages layering (sharding for an entire continent) correctly, all the problems wow modern had with under served demand at the outset, and over served supply at the epilogue will be balanced properly in both stages of the game's life cycle.
---
That too. But just running around inspecting people to look at gear and if people have gotten upgrades from last week was fun too.
---
*laughs in Lupos*
---
Probably a gnome mage called Jimmy.
---
Ok, thanks for the info.
---
CoH was godly back in BC lol
---
I'll be making a Thex on every server in honor of you.
---
Ahh sorry just meant gcd.
---
Indeed. We all had that ONE friend who rolled Alliance on a different server instead of joining all of us and the Horde on Frostmane. We would often leave corpses in Stormwind for him.
---
Georgesucks, georgesux, whygeorge, etc
---
Yeah, but you'll be screwed pretty quick by no curse or magic removal either way pretty quickly.
---
Actually disappointed in the Warlock population, really thought it would be pretty low. I just want to be a special snowflake. Hopefully most of them are Horde.
---
Warcraft 3 taught me more about how to type quickly than any typing program.
---
Is that an actual value, or just a joke?
---
I heard from a friend that you can pay by working as a gm for a day or so!
---
didn't know about that wowhead(or other) dressing rooms, thx
---
Well your second question had the word viable in it which means you have a specific idea of what the word viable means in your head that you did not share with us.
---
So I went with the question that is easier to answer. You can Farm, it will just be slower as a healing class.
---
Yup or carry Jungle Remedy. You need to get rid of that dot ASAP in a 1v1 if you want to win
---
Farm felcloth or essences in felwood 
---
Duo DM east runs with a friend (enchanting + mining) for max efficiency
---
If you got patience, you can get fishing and cooking to max and make a fortune.
---
Someone who tested it in the beta said it seems to default at 3, though you could up it to 5 if you want.
---
check your inbox
---
Yeah meant gcd. Overall its a tiny amount of dps compared to orcs if you are a warrior and undeads wotfs utility.
---
It's not that, but the trolls that are trying to provoke that reaction that I'm not looking forward to. 
---
Remember boys and girls, if anyone in chat wants to talk politics, they're in it for the lulz.
---
That is a good method, and I have used it myself in the past. For names I didn't actually like, and ended up giving away anyway. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
For my actual main (and top alts) I have never had a problem with them already being claimed. In any game.
---
They also already fixed the blood effect. This wasn't missed, ultimately.
---
I think they are right, you will have most of the tools of a shadow priest, but you will be optimized for healing instead of dealing damage. You can farm gold still, it will just be slower.
---
Haha yes brain fart. I fail. I do it all subconsciously at this point though.
---
Hahaha. Yeah I have that one friend too. 
---
Damn you George. Loktar ogar!
---
40 warlocks, just keep summoning voidwalkers

PERSONNAL BIAS HERE, BUT WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY TO OFTEN HAVE I SEEN A HUNTER RUIN A RAID, A DUNGEON RUN OR GAME EVENTS AS A WHOLE. THEY CANT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS, THE CLASS ATTRACTS WAY TOO MANY ASS HOLE TOO. ONCE AGAIN, PERSONNAL BIAS. I HATE THEM WITH A PASSION. UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE ON THE INDIVIDUAL SCALE.
---
I mean, that is only “optimal” if it means someone is getting what they want out of the game.
---
I personally have no problem getting less loot if it means that I actually get to enjoy my raid time.
---
in p1. you can always do gathering or strat live runs for orbs. A slower way would be running dngs and sell what you get. Disenchanting, Playing auction house. 
---
p2. Lashers or DM:E jump runs with a warr/rogue is good gold.

Ah, I had a good chuckle when I found old Swimmaster in Thunderbluff.

I plan to play horde on a PVE server.  Sick and tired of the ongoing griefing on the PVP servers.  I saw a poll that showed about 35% of people plan to join a PVE server.  I think we'll be fine.
---
download addons
---
BSH was added in patch 1.4. Since that's all we really have to go on,  wowhead has it as phase 2.
---
Strong Fishing Pole would actually be a good candidate. It only requires level 5 and 10 fishing skills but skinning knife is still better if you are going to use it as a stat stick. As for casters, I would lean towards spell power over int.
---
Biggest question that gets asked whenever I post my fedex. The answer is still the same.
---
I keep advocating for people familiar with horde quests to go make one. Nobody has, to my knowledge.
---
I am seriously considering rolling on an RP PVE realm because I am going to be high as hell the entire time and just want to chill out as a high Druid, hook people up with shit while I level, etc.

Was about to boast about my 640x480 VGA quality camera built into my Audiovox flipphone but that was actually Summer of 2006.

That's because no one was seriously *discussing* anything. It was all about trolling a inciting reaction. Same guys singing Bush's praises would be the same guys vehemently bashing him the next hour. It's never about politics, but using that discussion point to piss someone off.

Can you share the Alliance one? Good luck finding Horde stuff as well.

I don’t expect to have to do them but if it’s going to be literally an entire layer pop in Elwynn then I am going to need a backup plan.

I wouldn't go minining as a priest.
---
Well since there’s only 8 debuffs you can’t use DoTs. Dungeon rotations tend to be a bit more complicated.
---
lmao this was hilarious
---
Bosses have their 1.12 loot tables. BSH will drop in phase 1.
---
Who the fuck uses grass as weed? 
---
No that’s a dumb analogy anyway. A better analogy would be if you posted on /r/trees and asked, “What’s the best type of green?” And when they start answering with different types of strain and you respond with, “No I mean what’s best shade of green?”. That’s basically how you’re arguing right now.
---
For sure I see where you’re coming from. Websites have existed for years that track raid progress and clear times for both retail modern wow and private vanilla servers so I’m sure it will be a thing in classic as well. Guilds use it to compare their raid times, dps, hps, etc.
---
Heres an example “scoreboard” for current private servers
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Speedrun/Default.aspx
---
i call Gizmorichard
---
There are ways, obviously you will be a fair bit slower than other classes but that’s just the way it is. I liked farming essences in epl as hpriest , but there are tons of better ways to farm gold. 
---
when you hit 60 just look at your servers economy, it usually varies but there is often some easy herb you can farm where the demand outweighs the supply quite heavily.
---
My heart pumped up with so much love reading this story 😭
---
&gt;Does that much dps matter unless you're going for server firsts?  
---
&gt;Re
---
Only if you're okay with knowing that someone else in your raid will always do more damage than you, just because of their race.
---
It's actually not on the GCD - it functions like Arcane Power for mages, for example.  However, the orc AP racial is on the GCD.
---
Not only does it save a heal during non-casting time, can be clutch during a stun or something where you are low on mana, but also gives you at least one tic of mana regent while it casts.
---
There is absolutely nothing for them to tell us at this point other than "Yup, still good to go!"
---
Right now they are in bug fix mode and trying to get everything squared away for as smooth of a launch as possible.
---
Blizzard isn't some kid that you feel the need to check in with every 2 hours.
---
Grenades, you pretty Much Get a free grenade off when they frost nova you and start casting frostbolt
---
I'd buy that burger.
---
I'm gonna shit on plebs
---
&gt;Once you get to 60 in the first month the amount of players ahead of the curve will be so small you'll have to put in a lot of much effort to find groups to do end game content.
---
In the wrong guild if you plan on rushing to 60 and don't have groups.
---
Graphic artist skills: Superb!
---
He will. He’s been playing on private servers
---
Blizzard: So, launch was delayed. *Was* delayed. Then we un-delayed it. Figured you guys didn't need to know. We gucci?
---
Ok.
---
Oh hey nice one =P  Cuz when you get all the extra +stam from gear your effective HP stays at base level right?
---
Who hasn't done some depraved shit in Goldshire for that 100G?
---
It's not enabled (at this time of writing). It will return in patch 8.2.5 (future patch). The issue is
---
+ Classic releases August (mid if name, late if game)
---
+ 8.2.5 releases in September (speculation)
---
They'll be telling us what the rewards will be in the next few days (I can only assume before classic name reservations). So then it becomes a question of
---
+ How valuable is a name that you may not even get
---
+ Does that value offset any potential RAF benefits
---
&gt; Coming in 8.2.5 is a revamped Recruit A Friend system. If you have active game time you’ll be able to recruit your friends—both brand-new to the game and returning champions—to share in your adventures. To do so, you’ll be able to use a new URL generation tool to create a custom link to give to your friends. By following the link, you’ll be connected to each other and will be able to see if they have purchased game time, resulting in rewards for you! For each month your recruits have active game time, you’ll earn a new reward such as unique pets, mounts, game time and more. These rewards unlock per month and scale with how many months your recruits have subscribed for. And, of course, with Party Sync you’ll be able to journey with your friends on any of your characters. We’ll have more information about Recruit A Friend rewards when we get closer to its release.

Energy drinks, coffee, peaches, yogurt, maybe the odd sandwich.

It's not about PVP being "bad", it's about the GRIEFING you get from level 60s killing and camping lowbies continuously.  Where is the war, "honor" or anything else in that ?  I enjoy pvp as well when it happens between somewhat equal level players that respect eachother and challenge each other's skills.  But I don't respect some mouthbreather loser that has nothing else to do but griefing other players.  Blizz should ban them permanently.
---
They never said bosses will have 1.12 loot tables. They only said the items will have their 1.12 stats. They even mentioned phase 5 will include loot table shuffling similar to what was done in vanilla.
---
Get two 60s, rank 10, full T2 and some AQ pieces. Eventually get carried through Naxx by overgeared friends.

well im 31 now....
---
and honestly I have more time to play than when I was 16, then I was in three sports and had school and stuff
---
now I have a job with flexible hours that I can often do from home and not much else on my plate
---
Though the game uses your actual fishing skill when determining whether you land, glancing blow, miss etc.  So you'd have to continually level fishing as you go to actually hit mobs past level 10.  
---
During the beta it became a meta to use a fishing pole at level 30/40 because you could get fishing skill theoretically to 225/300 where weapon skills could only get to 150/200, thus allowing a lot more melee damage versus red or ?? mobs
---
I'm talking about pure longevity of what many of you would say is a "better" version of retail WoW.  Going for a few select weapons isn't that satisfying for most people I'd bet.
---
The real discussion here for people that care about the overall experience of the game, is back to the first point you make about how some people will be done in 12 days.  If we expand on some people to most people being done in say 1-1.5 years, what happens to the population and thus the experience for everyone?  WoW Classic won't last without a population to support the 'massive' part of MMORPG.
---
Is it really that odd to discuss new end game mechanics when nothing 'new' has been promised outside of the original phases already described?  I think it is useful to bring up things that could make this game fun for a very long time for a lot of people.
---
Use counterspell whenever the warlock casts a shadow spell (including drain life/mana)
---
Apex came out of absolutely nowhere, too
---
Damn dude your guild sucked
---
In the light of what people has said in this tpoic i don’t get why troll best race for mage?
---
Why would you ask this question? You never even played priest in TBC. You're essentially a newbie healer. This comparison tells you nothing about how to play the game.
---
Sadly with all this free time I've been exploring and researching most of the instances as best I can.  I actually know the entire layout of BRD now...
---
I think there were some all priest groups doing some impressive things, but that may have been 5-mans not raids.
---
To be *fair* having hundreds of layers would be pointless, no matter the circumstances.
---
Most likely it's 4th on Horde side because usually there "role" breakdown on both sides is similar and because we have more Shamans than Alliance has Paladins, there should be more Priests on Alliance meaning Mage probably is Horde's 3rd most played class, not Priest.
---
It's just a guess on my end, tho.
---
If WoW is not about timed content, why do so many people have /played competitions in leveling?  Why do server firsts for X raid matter?  Timed content seems like an acceptable thing to add.  It's worked well in Diablo and it could be tuned to work for WoW.  You don't have to play it either.
---
People like competition and having a way to do that without adding arbitrary raids and power inflation sounds like an alternative worth discussing.  If we just 'add x expansion + new gears + new levels', I have a hunch we'd be down the same path as retail, but hopefully without all of the 'nice newbie features' we all agree are not wanted.
---
Shoot I even had fun with my friends playing jumping puzzles in Guild Wars 2 for a bit.  Just another way to goof off that doesn't mess with the core gameplay/progression of classic.
---
Don't forget that both Druid and Warlock can debuff armor with FF and CoR.
---
If thats the case then they shouldn't add anything after Naxx.  If people like yourself will never be satisfied without a gear treadmill, you should just stick with whatever new expansion comes after BFA.
---
I like the idea of mythic plus in classic but loot would be a massive issue because adding loot or pathways to existing loot would change the game immensely. 
---
So I’d be down for mythic plus that had no extra reward other than: Morkorgork[Trade]: dudesssss we just beat Van Cleef in mythic +9. 
---
But yea - the incentive should be just personal entertainment. Even if they added the weekly affixes that would be fine - so long as beating the dungeon does absolutely nothing for you. 
---
Being a T3 geared guild wiping hard trying Onyxia on mythic 12 with crazy affixes would be entertaining. 
---
Not a fan of linkable achievements so I don’t want that involved either.
---
i say just spam dungeons  
---
live strat is a big gold farm, but all of them give you a pretty nice amount. its not super efficient compared to most gold farms, but at least you'll always have groups as a healer
---
Seems really common for the tier of player running max engineering to also have faps (free action pots) which I imagine let a warrior do damage to a mage
---
Played Troll Priest through most of AQ before RL got me. I LOVED it, saved raid wipes, five man content I could pull out some crazy HPS if things were getting iffy. And in PVP it came turn a battle. I think a lot of people don’t want to see how awesome it can be because, well, you have to be a troll.
---
I'm pretty much 100% sure that no RAF benefit will apply to classic, so this is only for people who play both, no?
---
Oh, I like it! Hope to see you in game, Giz!
---
Found the Goblin
---
How do we do it?? Do I just download client and get a subscription? Do you think here will be a banner on the website or something?
---
I want my ugly female dwarf hunter to be named Mommy; Ultimate World PvP humiliation.
---
They're not doing the cutscenes in wc3 reforged either from what I've read
---
I did I just not get it or was it just not funny?
---
Z should have been for zug zug
---
Another good point, perhaps 3rd party tracking of stats and clear rates is all that is needed for extended end game for Classic.  I think the general backlash has been against the nostalgia feeling everyone has.  Why change it when we just want the original?
---
Time will tell if the 3rd party support for competition is enough to keep the player base motivated without new content.
---
Thanks for the link!
---
Short answer: No.
---
 Long answer:  Hell no.
---
What about a mythic plus Onyxia for your BWL farming guild (waiting for the gates to open) AND there is no bonus loot or achievement or incentive other than you had fun?
---
You wont sell any mats on AH for a long time. For cash go skinning and vendor the leather.
---
&gt;But mostly, sunder armor is so important in 3 warrior party
---
Don't forget the fourth DPS is typically recommended to be a paladin, who also benefit a ton from sunder.
---
don't think you can use melee abilities with a fishing pole as it is not a melee weapon, just auto attack.
---
For melee classes, in PvP, pop it before you stun them. It’s really only useful if you can get consecutive hits in. It’s more applicable for casters and hunters in PVP. a quick frost bolt tank 1 with berserking to get that enemy rogue slowed. Lightning fast Chain-lightning. (Couldn’t help myself) sorry for format on phone.
---
Classic will last as long as the servers are up.
---
Anyone concerned for "after naxx" (not saying you personally) is not going to even make it to ZG phase... it's 2019, they will get bored and move on.
---
Which is why I set my expectations reasonably- if the game sucks me in and I raid weekly with my guild then great - if not, I'll be sure to ENJOY the launch month because that's when classic will be at it's best.
---
Anyone concerned with r14 or full T3 are a small % of the small % of players that will be playin in 2 years.
---
I won't be playing daily for 2 years and I tout vanilla as the best version of wow.
---
Why won't I play everyday when it's the best version of wow? Because it's an mmorpg and plenty of other games have 20-60 hour experiences that I will enjoy.
---
Anyone thinking wow will be there only game for 2 years is either delusional, in a hardcore guild (inba 15 year old game - lol) or they don't play games and only play wow.
---
All that being said - doesn't matter the landscape for classic 2 years from now - 90% of people (including myself) at launch won't be here in 2 years.
---
I haven't been subbed in months, and was t in beta, and I have a classic option.
---
Even more curious though, why are they saying stress test installs can be removed. Isn't there another stress test? Or do they know something we don't?
---
name *absolutely* checks out
---
thanks for the info
---
DM east jump runs will be your go-to. 
---
My guildie and I would do it as a holy priest/paladin combo but can work with any tank really. Make sure you have mining, herbalism, and enchanting to d/e between the two of you. All the mats we collect approximated at 100g/hour total, 50g/hr each which is on-par with the best farming methods in the game. Not to mention you’ll often find class trinket books and if you’re super lucky a foror’s compendium which is needed for quel’serrar and sells for a boat-load
---
Can anyone confirm it was on GCD in the beta? I remember it not being so
---
Yea, this is some cringey shit. Probably targeted to pre-teens, though.
---
Gimme yo name and I'll hold it for ya

Bad ones did, good hunters just used mana pots.

I'm aiming to be level 60 in 2-4 weeks and the alt to level 60 in like 3 months.

Aaaaand it’s gone.
---
Where does that 0.14% come from?
---
A WoW ponzi scheme.  Now I've seen it all.
---
&gt; worthless without a realm list
---
Seriously. We are less than two weeks from character creation and less than a month from launch, and we do not have a server list. I hope they give us at least a few days notice so we can coordinate realm choices with our friends.
---
It's almost like they are doing the bare minimum to appease demand for Classic without actually trying to make Classic flourish. It's seriously almost like they are hiding the fact that **WORLD OF WARCRAFT IS RELEASING IN 27 DAYS**. You would think it would be a big deal.
---
Well you know where to put it.
---
3min CD isn't that bad, there is no cast time (its instant) and its not on the GCD. The mana cost is negligible because its 7% of your BASE mana. At max effect its a 30% increase to attack/casting speed. That is really good for hunters/casters.
---
That's a good point. Thanks for bringing that to my attention.
---
I'm looking forward to the culture shift from phase 1 to 2. I expect myself and most people around my leveling block to refrain from pvp for the most part, as the only benefit is "fun" and we are leveling quicker than others because we are valuing efficiency, not "fun".
---
I think that more lucrative would be skinning/mining if you want to switch skinning for eng.
---
 If you want to have tailoring/engineering at 60 you should probably lvl with tailoring/mining. 
---
But this is all theorycraft because the server economies might differ.
---
Disc / Holy &gt; Shadow in PvP. Unless you just want to run around solo and try to snipe HKs.
---
Will it spit you out just like the whale does the seal ?
---
There will definetely be an armory maybe not by blizz but for sure by players, private servers use legacyplayers and ive never seen someone not Get a raidspot or ginvite because of their legacyplayer stats. Low dps? Could be that his guilds tank wasnt geared enough to hold aggro etc, so many factors come in to play for it to matter
---
I think this is where I stop.  You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how sims are created, optimized, and used in practice, and I don’t really have the patience to explain all of it.
---
Step 1: Respec to resto
---
Step 2: ???
---
Step 3: Collect your offspec enhancement set
---
Hopefully rank 10 with one toon and full raid clear with another. Probably a warrior and priest respectively 
---
Same boat, 31 with a wife and kid but fortunate enough to have flexible working in my job
---
doing the lords work
---
\+20 frost/fire dmg or +20 shadow dmg on gloves would be too good to pass up for casters and would last a very long time. Can you imagine a level 4 Warlock dotting up mobs with +50 shadow dmg (weapon + glove enchant)?
---
RIP
---
This is assuming we retain access to log in after the name creation day. But if we do this would be the best option if names aren't temporarily account locked post-deletion.
---
Actively managed how?
---
Who guarantees me that I will ever get my gold back?
---
Do I get to pick any features I don't like about 1.12 and remove those as well? Does everyone get to do this?
---
Pardon my ignorance because it's been so long, but how exactly is it saving time? I understand the skip gets you to Menethil Harbor more quickly, but if you're a low level and need to level up anyway and would've gone through Loch Modan and Wetlands to get there, what's the gain? Or is the idea that Loch Modan or Wetlands are inefficient leveling zones (or zones people just don't like) and this allows you to get to more efficient ones directly? And if so, where are people leveling instead?
---
Friends who have really short attention spans and will quit early because they only want to play FPS'.
---
On the original beta I made a rogue who I leveled to 18 and I was always amazed by these guys turning into animals, once I saw someone blazing past as a cheetah I knew what I wanted to roll when the game went live. 
---
I think I gave up my druid around lvl 40, rolled a rogue leveled him to 60 and then continued with my druid a while later. 
---
My druid's leveling time : 33 days to 60. 
---
World pvp, dueling and gathering different sets for your druid was so much fun and I'll always have fond memories of that but fuck me did they get the short end of the stick. 
---
History will repeat itself and druid's will be the least played class when the healers are starting to burnout.
---
I can't wait to get lost running through the mazes outside of dungeons trying to get inside.
---
Either nelf disc/holy priest or gnome mage. Both female ofc. I don’t do alts as I dont see the appeal.
---
O sure, but some guild might say “we allow a shadow priest to put up the increased shadow damage debuff so warlocks go ham). Some guilds might allow a ret paladin or a feral Druid, does that change the numbers? 
---
Again, it probably won’t but we will see since some debuffs might not stack like hey do on private servers.
---
I intend to craft myself a thunderfury. Zero interest in the honour system
---
I hope to eventually get to 60 and hope my friends are burnt out on max level content by the time I get there sometime in later this year.
---
The same question gets asked around once or twice per day, so expect a lot of people going this route.
---
Great video, was that runescape music or am i tripping?
---
Build your apps using react native or flutter and you’d have this solved in a jiffy
---
Im gonna hunt those damn murlocs
---
Yeah, I have my doubts about how much people will play too.  It will never be the same as the 2004-2007 populations, but it will be crazy for a couple months as you say.
---
Perhaps people will leave after a year or so, or just realize that it isn't what it used to be.  If that's the case then that makes sense.
---
I wonder what happens after that, for the remaining 100k or less.  Probably doesn't matter since they're just die hard fans and will play no matter what.  Maybe this is a moot discussion....
---
However, I do like talking about new features in games so I think it is fun to talk about what could make the original version of the game last longer for those true fans that do keep playing.
---
Hopefully we all have a blast with minimal effort from blizz!
---
I installed it immediately when I saw it and I launch it everyday just to see the login screen, secretly hoping that for some unexplained reason it will live I can play, but it never is.
---
I believe they were referring to "LW" as skinning and not leather working. But he's trying to get across that you take 5 seconds to skin something for 3 extra silver, when you could just kill another mob in 7 seconds (2 seconds slower, but you gain exp) and get the vendorable loot from it.
---
And the strawman commeth. 
---
If you have some practical experience playing a priest that pertains to this thread please share it. Thus far you haven’t added any insight deeper than what someone could glean reading this subs front page. 
---
When asked for facts and details you dodge, throw straw man arguments and insults . You operate from a set of 100% facts that only you have access to and boast of achievements that can’t be verified. 
---
I’m not saying that just because you can’t show any experience, insight or anything authentic doesn’t necessarily mean you are a liar and a poseur, though. Maybe you’re just misunderstood.
---
TIL 8 days is 25% of 10 days, smh
---
yup agreed, but not budget friendly saddly QQ requires epic shards QQ.
---
X is for Xroads
---
Since it’s the same sub I doubt they really care if you play retail or classic
---
This is what WoW is about and what many new people are about to realize, in just under a month.
---
Druids can decurse.
---
It's good practice to provide a link to original source, when you quote someone/something.
---
Ah, you’re right. Looks like we have no true way of knowing until launch. I think you’re quite likely to be correct though.
---
Ignore the mean people.  I also hope that a large Classic release makes them reassess their priorities.
---
Don't kid yourself, you'll be taking wad spec as your first talent.
---
No... the rest I guess are ok, wait am i getting paid for this?
---
I see cheese burgers yum. But, I am an alliance player &gt;.&gt;
---
Lot of people are forgetting all the little annoyances from vanilla. Buying your skills. Running everywhere. Earning xp at an unboosted pace. Not having all the little quest helpers we have now. How hard it was to generate gold for the mount or anything else. 
---
It is going to be a rude shock.
---
Yeah, I just did it for extra gold.  I guess that since my character was actually out there fishing then it didn't trip any major flags.
---
I don't know, but I do know that I will NOT be risking my classic character doing the same thing.  The incentive isn't worth the possible banning of a character that'll have days of played time.
---
You can tank in fury spec. We are talking about a tank prebis list in this spec. Your post makes no sense in this context.
---
stomp out some nerds
---
It was recently confirmed in a interview that I believe tipsout or staysafe did with one of the lead producers that tokens would not be in classic. Cant find the link now as I am at work but I was reading it last night.
---
https://youtu.be/Cd1ylt88LQ0 here's the hunters in Curse FD+drinking vs Patchwerk.
---
Yeah, i wont share the name, but i have the looks and name ready, but im still a little unsure about hair and beard styles and color. Gonna play a Dwarf male hunter.
---
I think you get to create 3 characters total, so my plan is to also create my bank character, and my primary alt,which will be a Dwarf male Warrior or Priest. Im hyped.. Only been wanting classic realms ever since tbc was released.. They sure take their time.
---
The Investment Firm. Reputation is important in Vanilla.
---
Check LinkedIn and you'll see Grock the Orc is an experienced player in the WoW Gold banking industry and definitely someone you can trust to handle your Mutual Funds.
---
Im just hyped for leveling, classic dungeons crawling and the feeling of being a "nobody" in a huge dangerous world.
---
Everything else is a bonus.
---
&gt; It certainly does enter unhealthy territories at times, but that’s no fault of the game or the hobby, but a conscious choice I make as an adult.
---
Yeah people do heroine or overeat and become obese too but I don't think we should be encouraging that.
---
WOW is famous for addiction. Addiction is addiction, it's not always a drug or alcohol. Sometimes it's sex, or porn, or gambling, video gaming, or whatever else.
---
We should *always* encourage moderation, and anyone pretending that sitting on your ass 12+ hours a day multiple days in a row is healthy is just being ignorant and disingenuous.
---
If you're going to be an unhealthy mess just to get a "leg up" in WOW, then admit it and own up to your sedentary decadence.
---
Yeah that was my fault for mentioning the Warrior, re reading it's confusing between all the coffee I'm drinking at work and my excitement for the coming days I'm spazzing a bit
---
Why can't we at least entertain the idea? There's still a good 28 days left and we've exhausted all possible legitimate discussions.
---
R is for ROUGE
---
Well I for one know that when I send gold to players hoping to get more back at a later date, I only do it when I'm bored and I only send it to players I've never met.
---
Damn. Going to a cabin with limited internet access on sunday, and I'll be there when characters creation is available. Not enough data to download the whole client. Was hoping I could download the client before that.
---
Any list that doesn't say Lionheart Helm, is bullshit. So no, it's not correct.
---

---
BSH was added to loot table in patch 1.4. As such, it will not be available in phase 1.
---
established.........
---
in a game that isnt released yet.
---
kk.
---
Not me. My brother and I have already decided to name our Shaman Aye wait a minute!
---
Correct.
---
I found this to be the opposite. Just like a dog that is bit when young I just attacked all horde I saw back in the day. I HATED them with a passion. All of them. Leveling was so tough as a warrior. "Just attack the enemy faction on sight because they will ALWAYS attack you", quote from warrior.
---
Also, won't leveling a warrior be significantly easier since we'll be on patch 1.12? This isn't as bad as people make it sound. Warriors are going to be top dps now and MC will be a joke :P
---
Well, 'game time' applies to both and they've indicated that game time will be part of it.
---
&gt;  you’ll earn a new reward such as unique pets, mounts, **game time** and more.
---
Of course if you're playing classic in the first place the sub-fee is the least of your concerns, but I mean, given the opportunity to profit vs not (for something so trivial) it's worth a seconds thought.
---
it doesn't have good the good racial mount reputation there.
---
I choose races for aesthetics and classes for their playstyle, which is why you'd never see me running around with a bunch of foul beasts, rotten corpses, or much worse, an orc. (trolls, you guys are ok)
---
I am fully aware of how they are used. But I have very little idea how they are made. So I'm looking at this entirely from a usage point of view. It's very possible that the things I talk about are easy/impossible or anything inbetween to implement, but from a usage perspective it's definitely something I at least would want out of a simulation if possible.
---
Buffing, mage food, WL summons/healthstones and no respeccing at will
---
Yes this is very true. I should have actually said melee (except hunters).
---
I think this is a neat idea.  Great example of emergent gameplay.
---
Make some new friends and have some fun playing a game I love.
---
"All characters automatically recover health after combat at a gradual rate. This healing rate increases if you sit down."
---
I have played wow for 13 years and just learned this today!
---
They get to do that?
---
The problem is that it's very hard to build trust because we don't have access to the logs.
---
Spellpower or spirit is way more useful for a caster, 22INT only gives you headaches because you now need 2 manadrinks for a full manapool. :)
---
It's also 25agi instead of 35agi, 35 is TBC.
---
Honestly I feel like this is what is going to happen Blizz gives streamers acces to name reservations a few hours early and they get their names.
---
There is reason, you might not agree but streamer hate because of privilege and how the effect the server is legitimate.  I don't know if I would waste my time with this, though.  100% chance blizz lets them reserve names in advance.
---
I hope I get to see you in the game. This story is awesome and I wouldn't mind helping you and your guild.
---
IIRC, the War Room wasn't added until later, not sure if they'll have it at launch for Classic though.  I distinctly remember having to go to the instance portal to queue when it was first released.
---
Low levels are temporary. No sense getting emotionally invested in it!
---
Hit lvl 60 before 2020.
---
~whoever you like a king~
---
~im looking for him~
---
~im going to californi-aaaa~
---
All joking aside: Yes. Completely agreed.
---
You can do scholo runs and reserve the runes. Same with strath and the orbs.
---
You'll have to convince ALOT of people
---
Dude, we don't care about streamers.
---
There was a white broom that was a rare drop from farmers near undercity. Level 3 or 5 item or something. But as a staff most people could use it. Throw fiery on it and it will take you a good long ways. I had a friend who used to farm and sell them for decent gold.
---
That is a good question worth asking to anyone who decides to try to implement this.
---
I'm aiming to clear Naxx, regardless of how long it takes.  
---
Realistically I'll be able to put in around 10 - 15 hours a day depending on how much I want to put in, so I should be ahead of most people.
---
I am greenyweeny, the hunter. My pet is named Thex
---
People would rage, I can't imagine they actually do this.
---
Are you out here, MTSilver? I miss you buddy. We raided together and had lots of fun shenanigans, all through vanilla wow and into league of legends after. IIRC we just drifted apart :(
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Console_variables/Complete_list/Classic
---
Yeah, I was more or less wondering out loud if other languages did that. I only have any experience with English, Spanish, and German. I ended up googling it and seeing the entire spreadsheet of languages and saw a lot of weird variations.
---
Right, but since I cant just AFK in stormwind I waste time going to the dungeon as well
---
whats the french song?
---
Absolutely. And it is only one example of emergent gameplay.
---
Maybe a group comes along that robs/extorts guilds or we see some sort of Peacebloom Bubble.
---
I'd constitute it as a reason if it'd make a difference. This won't change anything. I can empathize with streamer hate. I can't stand watching streamers play, even players whos content I have enjoyed in the past like Cdew are definitely entitled and reliant on his viewers to propel himself forward.
---
The proper plan of action for everyone with at least the maturity of a 5 year old would be to view the servers streamers are planning on playing on and choosing one they aren't on.
---
Well a lot of streamers plan to reserve names off stream (seen multiple saying they want to keep their server hidden until they can get a bit ahead) so for the most part people wouldn't know.
---
It was nothing. I got to the end and a was like "where's the content?".
---
AQ agility enchant is 25agi.
---
Yes, but it's not as simple as just making cleave better. 
---
As you start cleaving, you start splashing damage onto mobs without full sunder stacks yet, making sunder actively worse, and you also start generating more rage from every autoattack, so you are forfeiting more total rage every time you cleave. 
---
Also, be warned.... I did bias the calculation HEAVILY in favor of cleave. I really recommend reading the entire cleave slide. Mostly, the level 20 cleave estimate was just me trying to make cleave look as good as possible before I gave up on it.
---
Perhaps a website. Who knows what a dedicated player can accomplish.
---
...
---
Mike Tyson said to his wife.
---
What privilege?
---
for me what I have finally did the trick, I tried for ages to do as you suggested but I could never do it my eyes where never on the screen as I was always looking at where my fingers where.  With the mouse I don't have to think or look its just right there and its a gaming mouse its made for this, why not use a tool if it helps my grandfather always said
---
Yup, why else go for full raid BiS? Crazy stunts and accomplishments!
---
I'm sure I'm in the boat with many others while picking PvP, I would certainly prefer an rp-pvp if they ever change their mind going forward but feel confident the rp-pvp community will band together and make a pvp server our own
---
Realistically I just want to explore the original zones at my own speed. This time around I'll be playing with my friends from college, who also played back in the day. It will be familiar/nostalgic for us but also new because we haven't played together before.
---
All in all I'm hoping we stick it out to 60, hit the dungeons and level through some great zones, fuck around with some wPvP and other random nonsense that comes our way. 
---
I've got zero interest in min/maxing or serious grinding at 60, but more power to those that do. Personally I'm just looking to take my time and explore Azeroth again.
---
I don't think whoever says he's gonna breeze it is gonna run through all the instances multiple times, explore all of Azeroth and such
---
This is amazing! I'm jealous, haha.
---
But their /train is the best
---
That is super in-depth. 
---
I disagree with the role though- an ENH shaman doesn't just have to be a nightfall bot.  Other classes (warrior especially) achieve much better nightfall uptime than the Enh shaman. 
---
IF your guild is full on healers and/or short on shaman, you can still have a role as DPS.  If you play well your DPS will at least be comparable to other classes when factoring in the boosts you do.  The totem twisting playstyle isn't simple to do either so that matters as well, not everyone can effectively do that. 
---
I played around with enh PVE on a private server and used a variant of the elemental devastation build.  But WHY wouldn't you take clearcasting?  Only one point.. just have a 5.2 second shock cooldown instead of 5 sec you definitely won't notice that.  If anything you get a tic of 5SR regeneration that you wouldn't 
---
otherwise!
---
I also don't like the characterization of loot prio, yes of course you won't be top tier for any loot distribution but your raid should at least toss you a good 2H weap for your troubles.  If you aren't getting loot then what is the point of all this raiding?  At least get a 2H weap and some decent pieces to be able to actually go play the game, rather than sit there and spam nightfall in raids.  To each his/her own I guess. 
---
Amazing guide though
---
Thanks for this. I remember things not being very well balanced, but it was a long time ago and I quit playing WOW after Cata. Like lower lvl gear was better than higher lvl gear on some classes. Some class specs just weren't invited to raids etc. I think I want to play classic wow, but some of my memories of the state of the game weren't that positive. I have better memories of TBC, WotLK, and CATA... But no expansion (that i played) was perfect.
---
White boots with runspeed.
---
Yeah.. I just hate paladins in general (they always are out of mana it seems and they never keep blessing of might active), but if you have a good paladin, they compete with a druid. 
---
I will say though, a druid has an easier buff stack to maintain, they don't compete quite as hard on gear, and if they are possibly not as strong on dps (I don't know), They also do mainly physical damage while also not using their mana. 
---
I feel like you can go either way in terms of filling slots.
---
Finally someone is making sense. Classic is amazing, which is why we're all in this forum to discuss it.
---
Still, retail has merit. It is far away from any traditional definition of an "mmorpg", but it would be ridiculous to claim that the rotations and dungeon/raids mechanics aren't miles above what classic can offer.
---
As a hunter player, playing through Deadmines in classic wow is very fun for me.  I listen to the music and to the sound effects, I talk with my group during downtime, and every decisions that I make is centered around my very limited mana and health pool. This creates immersive and engaging gameplay. But notice that I didn't mention the rotation, simply because it doesn't offer me much.  Weaving serpent sting or multi-shot in between my  auto-shots is extremely basic.
---
Still as a (marksmanship) hunter, playing through Operation: Mechanon is very fun. I listen to the music and to the sound effects, I look at the amazing spell effects,  I talk with my group during downtime, and every second of combat is extremely interesting and engaging. I have to juggle a complex rotation and prioritize my spells. I have to manage unique mechanics that are difficult and complex enough that they make groups discuss strategies and make many attempts to correct themselves.
---
TL;DR. Back to OP's main topic. Classic has tons of strengths that make it (in my opinion) the best game of all time. Class rotations is not one of them.
---
I think I started around 1.6-1.7ish where the war room was already there. I woulda hated having to go to the instance portals
---
Ah so 15 agi for a 1h, 25 for a 2h?  my mistake.
---
That's cool as hell, I'm about to meet some friends I met on WoW about 8 years ago and I'm super excited!
---
40 shamans. Excellent AoE healing, can tank too and they can be below average casters.
---
Thanks I will edit my comment
---
For now you can just divide the other class results in half. While in reality there may be some outliers of each faction not having an even split, it's a good estimate.
---
Some guy on Reddit analyzed this exact topic, but it's been a few months back I'm sure.
---
Yeah I mean, do you, but it's definitely more efficient when leveling and can be very strong for pvp/battlegrounds.
---
Healing costs a lot of mana and also resets the timer on your spirit-based mana regen.
---
If you're leveling a shaman for example (especially as enhance), mana is the only thing that limits you and shocks/totems already drain you pretty fast. If you bandage on cooldown you can significantly reduce downtime. Less time drinking, more time killing.
---
At max level, bandages/anti-venoms are pretty important if you like to pvp. Again, mana is at premium, especially for hybrid classes. A druid using roots or a pally popping repentance to bandage for 0 mana is a huge advantage considering the first person to run out of mana usually loses.
---
If you can afford to put Crusader on a low level weapon, that proc can make it last a really long time on a warrior or paladin.
---
Depends on the dot BUT that’s for dots level 20 and above. **Every spell** trained at level 19 and below take a hit to spell coef.
---
Roger that 10/4 rubber ducky
---
Not having to put Quest items in my (already limited) bags, maybe. But it’s something I’m fine with in Classic.
---
Having the stun is too good and invaluable. Nothing comes close. If there was a 1sec cast 3sec stun as the 31pt talent, most people would go for it. It's an extra stupid good talent point + trinkets.
---
Why do people act like it's so hard to level warriors? It's slower because you have to generate rage to attack and then you have to heal up after a fight. But slower doesn't mean more difficult.
---
I'm gonna let it happen this time.
---
I hear you.. but it’s just so hard to justify leveling first aid if you also are trying to level tailoring. Or at least that’s my thoughts
---
Good to know, thank you
---
I believe the market in Wow is very volatile, and it would make investing very risky, albeit possibly profitable.
---
GM’s are just like every associate at any retail store ever - you ask a question, they just make something up completely on the spot and hope you just accept it and go away
---
Legends
---
I actually liked them because you could go and do some WPvP while waiting in the queue - there was a higher chance that you would meet someone as the other faction was probably doing the same given the relatively small distance between the entrances for each faction (IIRC).

---
5 toons ranging from 23-48 and one dope level 57!
---
I really think there will be more players in Classic than Retail in the first 2 months, but I could be wrong.
---
But when we hit Naxx, AQ, and the end of Classic it will sadly be a wasteland.
---
I meant an already established wow guild ya fucking tard.
---
Darkshore is easily the best zone after starting areas.
---
I don't watch streamers but I can only imagine playing the game will be 100% worse for them.
---
If people can stream snipe in the battle royal games they're totally fucked in classic wow. The biggest ones will probably be corpse camped so much blizzard will probabky need to make a policy against stream sniping so they can play at all outside a pve zone.
---
On the other hand if I run into the train of people on the same faction following them. I can just move to another zone and not be bothered.
---
I don't know why we as players are getting upset about this when the streamers themselves have the largest obstacle.
---
You're only allowed to reserve three names on the 13th so why would you waste them on a streamer that will most likely not even be on your server?
---
&gt; If you have some practical experience playing a priest that pertains to this thread please share it.
---
Does 3 years in a top 10 NA server first progression guild playing as a priest count?
---
But all that aside, you do realize you have explicitly made it clear you do NOT like the min / max mentality, and in fact, you seem to pride yourself on purposely going against the grain in this respect.
---
So at this point, I'm not even sure what you're trying to argue? Like you have made it clear you are not a min / max player, so what is your argument?
---
But let's ignore the fact that you're contradicting yourself and try to look at "facts and details". 
---
Ironically in this regard, NE explicitly lack the ability to actually quantify the value of their racials.
---
How do you put a hard number on the ability to afk while invisible? And star shards is a meme, everyone knows this. 
---
Human has 5% spirit, and gets an oh shit heal that's instant cast and recovers quite a bit of HP. Dwarf gets fear ward, arguably the best priest racial in the game, along with the same oh shit heal. 
---
Troll gets to cast rank 1 Shadowguard for a chance to stun any attacker for 3 seconds (27% chance against 3 charges for 50 mana, spammable). This also provides dispel protection, which works wonders combined with a single talent point in blessed recovery purely for the buff protection. They also have a numerically quantifiable racial bonus in their haste, which is extremely strong for both healing and mana burning, and actually has quantifiable value in pve. Troll also gets hex of weakness, which is the only other healing reduction ability in the game, which can be applied from 36 yards for a whopping 35 mana to the entire battleground as you see fit. It's also a curse, so paladin cannot dispel it either. 
---
Undead gets WoTF, which is obviously pretty strong, but not something I would value over the numerous advantages Troll would give you. Devouring Plague is also amazing in 1v1 battles and world pvp, but is easily dispelled (and cured by jungle remedy, something most serious pvpers should have a stash of ready to go). However, it does equal out to a nice dps increase in pve and when combined with inner focus you can actually use it on the boss during periods of heavy AoE damage to keep yourself topped off while raid healing. So it has it's uses outside of 1v1 pvp. 
---
Night Elf gets Elune's Grace, which is incredibly underwhelming and cannot be casted in shadowform, and the ability to afk while invisible. 
---
So, what exactly are you trying to argue? You claim to not care about min / maxing, and all you care about is "making it work" and "having fun". So what exactly is the point you're trying to make?
---
I thought they were all making not-a-streamer-name to hide from everyone anyway, or did they forget that?  You can't really hide if you just use your actual streamer name.
---
I appreciate you entertaining this thought.
---
Yeah. that might be useful. 
---
Not sure what the actual classic armor values are going to be yet though. Sunder gets a LOT worse when you overshoot the zero armor mark, and I was kinda surprised.. that can happen. Certainly at 22 in deadmines, most of the mobs do not have 900 armor. 
---
Really, I think I might have to just wait for launch and modify spreadsheet values afterwards.
---
Good points. I guess it's coming finally, and will be here for us to enjoy. I'll take a chill pill, enjoy the concert and make sure i have Mountain Dew and spicy cheetos ready to go.

How “L” wasn’t Leeroy Jenkins I’ll never know.
---
Yeah I would be hesitant to invite you with that kind of reflex.
---
That's right. When people say warriors scale best with gear, this is why! More damage = more rage = more damage.
---
It hasn't been said but nobody will be surprised if they do currently it is just tin foil hat speak.
---
IDK, this feels to me like you're mostly talking out your ass tbh.
---
I only consider Dwarves to be bro tier. The rest can die.
---
You’re describing everything in Classic, basically. Everyone goes to the same places - you just get there at wildly different times.
---
I’ll just be ahead of almost every other person easily, and will be 60 in barely over a week. I’ll post the screenshot here so you can apologize.
---
If someone made an all druid raid guild that screwed around on the weekend or something, count me in i would 100% join.
---
Part of the skill of being a good healer in Retail is positioning yourself ahead of the tank strategically, taking breaks to drink at every opportunity and working with the group to minimise downtime.  
---
I think Preach has some videos of him healing random pug groups where he explains his positioning and movement, they're worth a look for anyone interested.
---
I think M+ is really fun, perhaps my favourite type of content in the game right now.  I'm looking forward to Classic dungeons, of course, but M+ changed the game for me!
---
You can grab enchanting for 10c and have to option to disenchant BoP quest items/old gear that might net you big increases in gold. Skinning is more arguable, but that's free gold too.
---
Do you have a source for this?
---
I don’t agree with your don’t agree; I think it’s actually closer to a push. 
---
While paladins are annoying in group PvP, warlocks are worse for a mage in both single and group settings. Since Alliance has such a smaller amount of warlocks, it offsets the paladin advantage imo. Having WOTF to defeat one of your hardest counters is at least as valuable as having to face more of a hard counter with fewer tools + shamans.
---
For example, see the spell coef below:
---
* Corruption Rank 2 at level 14 is 77.5% coef or Rank 3 at level 24 is 100% coef
---
Did the seal survive? Please tell me it got away!!
---
I, for my part, actually liked when they were introduced. I hated to have to wait for a bg to start for an hour or so.
---
It changed in TBC, I believe, to include a "per hit" effect". 
---
[But from what I have read, in vanilla at this stage, You just have a number, dependent on level, called your coefficient](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/18325-the-new-rage-formula-by-kalgan/).
---
Your rage generation is just "7.5 times the damage you do, plus 2.5  times the damage you take, all multiplied by your coefficient". 
---
And of course, you cannot generate rage on yellow attacks. So autoattacks only.
---
I'm going to Zap you to dust, imperialist scum.
---
It tells you to farm mobs on the way to/from quests. It tells you what level to be at after certain questing/hub milestones.
---
Are you saying most people won’t follow the guide? Not much i can do about that. The point was to follow the guide.
---
Pretty sure it does on pservers too?  but only castable while you actually have mana.
---
Itd be interesting to see how much speed you sacrifice for dat sweet sweet skinning cash while leveling.
---
On the other hand: sitting on 95% mana throughout an encounter is not my idea of resource management.
---
They dropped the ball on that... hard.
---
I'll post my cozy nook when i get it ready ina  few days. Moving a lot of stuff home tomorrow
---
Yeah I mean I too have access to wowhead.
---
Honestly, I expect to do about as much as I did when I was 11-13. 
---
I'm 25 now. I have a long-term girlfriend, and I will be starting a teaching task starting on August 23rd. Classic essentially comes out at the worst possible time, and so I won't be able to play TOO much.
---
My aims are purposefully vague so that I don't get disappointed (and maybe angry?) if something doesn't go my way. I don't want to blame my career or my girlfriend for not being able to achieve my gaming goals.
---
As such, my aims are mostly to have fun with my friends at the release, and to finally learn how to goddamn balance this game with a healthy lifestyle. I probably will be playing around 15-20 hours a week to level my hunter to go through my bucket list of zones, dungeons or quests I remember fondly. :)
---
X is for XxSephirothxx
---
On PServers you do not lose the mana
---
So far I've been told there's a whopping 2 people who have worked on vanilla. I think my premise is just fine, thank you.
---
Yeah, in the late game one crit has a warrior spike up from 5 rage to like 90+ lol.
---
That would be amazing to see. 40 Demo specced warlocks, bags full of shards, just every 6 seconds sending a new voidwalker at a boss.
---
It's usually pretty shit in pvp but quite amazing for pve.
---
So going from "no one on the Classic team has developed or even played vanilla" to going to at least 2 is a success? You didn't believe in your premise to being with I see. You do realize these are just the 2 people that are the face of Classic, right? There are more people on the Classic team and to suggest that none of them have even played vanilla after already being proven wrong about NO ONE even playing vanilla is delusional at best.
---
World of Warcraft Classic is the Game of Thrones Season 8 of MMO’s.
---
This video from Defcamp and Melderon TV goes into it very well.  
---
https://invidio.us/watch?v=HBDfRiB1Zlk
---
Argumentation? 
---
Who advises someone to take courses 😂😂
---
yeah, i doubt we'll go in one shotting every boss in the game, what's your point?
---
Auto loot is in Classic.
---
Got it, thanks.
---
I could see that happening over time. I don't expect an insane amount of people to still be playing after a few months of classic tho.
---
Because it isn't. Beserker sucks.
---
and that's relevant how?
---
Testing in the beta has indicated that elite mobs do WAY less damage. so it is practical to power through dungeons with so much less total healing, that you may NEVER need to sit down and drink if you have a priest with spirit tap.
---
Next up, warriors have huge synergy with other warriors: not only do they have a lot of abilities that require multiple targets, but they don't want those targets to be hitting THEM. 
---
So if You and I play warriors, and we both stand next to each other, and I rend your mob, and you rend mine: We just are now BOTH better off than if we were alone. 
---
Beyond that, we can share buffs, which are really expensive normally but now cost half as much. We can also do really difficult quests, as now we have 5 guys including a healer, to get powerful gear for the most gear dependent class in the game. 
---
Beyond that, sunder stacks nonlinearly. The 5th sunder is just BETTER than the first. Significantly. 
---
And next, fighting elites, it turns out, unlocks the viability of entirely new classes of abilities that turn out to be very good but which are completely unusable solo (if you tried to solo elites, you would both be almost dead before you even got 5 sunder stacks up). 
---
So, basically, the new meta is emerging, supported by early testing, that this is just the easiest, fastest, most lucrative way to level a warrior, and it's SO fast that it's actually faster than solo levelign a priest.
---
But all of that was for the beta, the real game is a completely different story.
---
Yeah I don’t think I’ll be able to do that.
---
I think it’s going to take people way longer to hit 60 than they think. I think it’ll be 2 months for myself (8 days played).
---
Sweet deal!
---
RPPVP\*\*\*\*\*
---
Screenshot or it didn't happen.
---
Not really having many mana issues at the moment. There would be no way to get ahead of the tank in 99% of these instances at the lower level. I tried earlier today and I guess I wasn’t supposed to be there because he stealthed to do something and then took off as I aggrod everything. Then the prick called me a retard and berated me for 5 minutes before I said fuck it and left. Wow retail has one less healer in lfg, never doing it again!
---

---
Lol you literally have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Kill the horde
---
Enemy cast bars &amp; Dot timers is all I want in my life. For me it doesn’t feel like wow without it.
---
Mainly, the pooling part is only useful for increasing efficiency at launch I think.  Only one player has to keep an eye on the AH constantly to buy up cheap mats and items that will go up in price as the economy matures.   Only one player has to keep track of what those items are likely to be.
---
But I wouldn't send my gold to a stranger to save a few minutes, so maybe with a group of friends.
---
Im psyched for Classic as much as the next guy, and dont even really enjoy retail beyond running dungeons with IRL friends, but there are more mechanics in retail. Dont kid yourself.
---
gold
---
The hit chance was a bit broken on private servers and many people on here have only experienced vanilla in that form
---
LF carry plz tnx
---
R13 &amp; Naxx.
---
Bg queue wherever you are would be nice, as long as bg’s remain non cross realm.
---
BC’s dungeon finder would be nice.
---
I would love a fully fleshed out vanilla achievement system.
---
Nothing impactful to shrink the world or sense of community just basic QoL changes.
---
I honestly can’t think of anything else, except maybe cross faction auction house. Neutral exists but it’s a long walk.
---
You people invented that. This classic+ stuff does not exist lol. TBC is something much more plausible and something we could expect. I respect your opinion and all, but this is wishful thinking.
---
That would be.. interesting
---
Thats very educated from you!
---
Hah, m+ is dungeons. Mythic without the + is raiding. They have dungeons that scale up in difficulty now, infinitely so long as you beat the previous difficulty. It's hard as fuck.
---
Only if i can purchase them all with money ;D
---
How are you going to play on a sever that isn’t being provided for you?
---
Like back when "make me a sammich" used to incite rage in trade chat omg
---
This post is specifically about warriors. A warrior in a melee cleave group will leveling faster in dungeons than if the warrior were questing/grinding outside of dungeons.
---
bafana bafana!
---
You must have never raided MC and BWL?
---
But that Night Elf booty
---
since its a swedish site, are danes welcome?
---
Except he will have to say goodbye at 41
---
Even better. Thanks for updating my knowledge!
---
Thanks friend!
---
Was Stonard Portal in Vanilla? Preeett sure it was not.
---
Yeah Druid by far. They’re the only ones who could clear most of the raids. Paladin might work for a while but aggro would be all over the place and the dps would be extremely low. It just wouldn’t work beyond MC. 
---
For the rest I don’t think any other class can kill a single boss. Maybe 40 fury warriors could nuke down a few bosses in MC but I doubt it.
---
I just love how that guy didn't even propose a counter argument, he went straight into insults and told you to get educated. Amazing analytical and argumentative skills he showed off there. Just amazing.
---
I like how you bitched out when you started getting downvotes, that was my favorite.
---
Rly? That's a feelsbadman I've been viper stinging druids the one tick they go out of bear form for ages...

---
As for the flight paths and floating combat text, no direct source that I can refind, but there was reddit posts about those 2 being fixed before, people celebrated the flight path one
---
I don't think you should base your entire lineup around pre-30, as that is only a small portion of the grind. A melee cleave reaches its full potential at level 36/37 when you get whirlwind and ravager and sees a great spike in power at level 30 when you get SS. Obviously you should try and mix max everything, but level 30+ is where melee cleave shines.
---
We could, though that allows users to spam responses. We’d prefer to try to keep it to one per user.
---
This. I’ve leveled on a PVE and a PVP server, and just being older and grumpier, being griefed isn’t part of the game I want to experience again. Losing 3 minutes here, 8 minutes there just for corpse running adds up.
---
or you can just wait until you're level 15 and you'll be just fine...
---
Have you tried contacting him? He might be missing you too?
---
Pretty sure it can’t be applied while in forms, but if it’s applied while in caster and you go into forms it continues to drain for its duration.  Are you saying hunters were able to apply it while the Druid was in bear form during the beta?
---
Come on man didn't they offer classes in argumentation where you went? They are all the rage where I live /S
---
Seems more like activitism investing than a cartel.
---
Demonic runes work well. Give you mana at a cost of health so popping one of them before berserking can help maximize it
---
That is what we originally had but it led to too many categories we felt. Figured users can add their weekday and weekend times together and divide by 7 just the same. 
---
Though we’ll make note for next time.
---
didn't know this existed. Amazing! Thank you
---
Though “played” could always me they created an account and got to level 15 before getting bored. It’s hard to tell.
---
I have never seen anyone try that, so I don't really think you need to worry. I've only seen people ninja by needing on something they shouldn't - and usually because they didn't know any better. But maybe I'm just picky with who I PUG with ;)
---
Auto dismount when casting spells.. holy fuck is that shit annoying
---
You obviously want a shaman if you are horde, as windfury totem is a huge boost in dmg and rage generation. As alliance, a paladin is probably the closest you get to enh shaman utility, but not as good. Maybe pre-30 one of the warriors can take on more of a tanking role, but the most don't do that much dmg at that level, so it seems like a waste.
---
Lol wrong.
---
Demonic rune + arcane power + mind quickening gem + zerking. No mage beats that DPS output for pve.
---
Definitely will, I'll keep my eyes out - if I recognize you I'll be the shadowpriest /waving your corpse ;)
---
I’m sure the Securities and Exchange Commission would regulate it.
---
/s
---
Druid... have all your bases covered via their different specs.
---
Yeah but your engineering pet as a gnome will be higher level
---
Your last point is my most frustrating take from this survey.
---
It can be applied at any time, but does not drain the Druids mana bar while they’re in a form. If you’re last second Vipering a Druid before bear and seeing they have less mana it’s probably because Bear/Cat costs a lot of mana. Travel is the only low mana form to shift. At least this is how it works on PServers. I actually just double checked, assuming maybe Druid Bar was lying to me, but no my mana wasn’t getting drained. Just hopping bear costs a lot
---
It is known.
---
Maybe ask a friend who doesn't need all 3 names to register yours on his account until you're back.
---
It would be pretty sad to see it unplayable for an entire week. Some private servers have launched with 10k population, and a fairly acceptable first DAY. Let alone a week. Managing multiple servers shouldn't be harder for a large company.
---
I don't doubt what you're saying tho. Blizzard has been pretty wimpy on investing in hardware recently. There's videos of large PvP encounters on legion/BFA that just lag like crazy.
---
Wow! I'm glad I was planning on being a warrior. Although I hope this doesn't mean there will be too many of them. I like being in high demand haha.
---
Hey mate, sorry I'm terrible at remembering to check Reddit as I normally am not a Reddit user. I know it's been a week, but if you're still interested we'd be happy chat in discord. The link can be found in my OP.
---
Gotcha
---
Do that, but with Asmongold instead
---
I’m not sure I understand the question, I’m sure you are referring to the “non meta” specs like shadow and ret, you’ll get raid spots just for the body honestly. And all specs can do OK damage, just don’t expect to be in a super hardcore main raid team haha
---
95% of this had near perfect syllable balance. As a lyricist, I respect that.
---
Any of those Icelandic?
---
That's really sad to hear. Considering some PS launches went very smooth, and they were being run by donations :/
---
Never really understood this argument. Many aspects of 1.12 aren’t being added until phase 4-6 so wouldn’t X-realm bgs be the same if we went by that logic?
---
My main issue is deciding if i want to go with tryhard larp names or edgelord meme names.
---
The war room Npc were added later, previously you had to run to the actual battleground zone and walk through the portal.
---
The moment it is launched and I can log in with my character to start the grind. ;)
---
You are misquoting me either intentionally or not.
---
"the Classic dev team has neither worked on Vanilla [...]"
---
No where did I state that no one has worked on Vanilla as you are alleging. If there are only 2 people on the dev team who have experience with Vanilla out of one or two dozen people then that means the overwhelming majority of the dev team didn't which validates my premise. 
---
I'm still waiting to hear who these other developers even are and what they've worked on previously, but no one seems to know and yet they expect me to put blind faith in their abilities because apparently not doing that makes me "delusional".
---
A Paladin tank would actually be able to keep the aggro, with only ret pallys DPS'ing! The only question is, would the tank be able to out-threat the healers? (JK, I love Paladins )
---
&gt; you would have to be a sociopathic dick to do this.
---
Haha Jesus Christ! How is the weather up there, so high on your horse?
---
I have to say it, it's just plain weird that people on this sub will simultaneously go "Boo heirlooms! Easymode! Go back to retail!" and also "Yay ghetto heirlooms, +30 spellpower and +4 to all stats for my noobs, clever and valid and fun!".
---
If anything these ghetto heirlooms are more powerful than retail ones at low levels because retail heirlooms scale down for low level characters and these do not.
---
You can't get out of root with fap and you can't use it every time you are against mage!?

Lol...do you not remember barrens chat being full of bush invading Iraq?
---
If you have gold you can invest early you are looking more at the ballpark of 500% returns.
---
People will be straight up dumping blue twink items and crafting materials that will fetch a premium in  few weeks or months.
---
But again if you have loose gold you can do that yourself.
---
I guess the pooling part might normalize the risk/reward a bit.  
---
Easier to pick up "probably gonna make me rich" items if it's not your entire life savings at risk.
---
I know how you feel about luck. My alt rogue who, honestly, I just loved getting high and running UBRS on got two felstrikers and finkles skinner. Don't think that will happen again / I have the time to do that place 50 times on an alt.
---
Theres a facebook group in my small city in Sweden that has around 300+ people confirming them "attending" and we're all organizing to join the same server aswell.
---
Gonna be a few servers taken by the Swedes/nordics just like retail lol
---
Damn, that’s depressing lol.

From investopedia: "An activist investor is an individual or group that purchases large numbers of a public company's shares and/or tries to obtain seats on the company's board to effect a significant change within the company. A company can become a target for activist investors if it is mismanaged, has excessive costs and could be run more profitably as a private companyor has another problem that the activist investor believes it can fix to make the company more valuable"

comehonoreye
---
True, I think i'll be pvping during phase 1 when i'm getting tired of leveling and need a break.  Plus i'll need practice for phase 2, I haven't been a big pserver player at all, and only played back during tbc and wrath so.
---
I remember it working this way in Vanilla, whenever you cross a hard server boundary like into the deeprun tram, or into an instance, or across continents, you get rezzed. I don't know if it's more or less of an exploit than swimming around and drowning yourself.
---
I’ve always played Horde, but the guild I’m playing with for Classic are all going alliance.

People don't want to carry other people that are doing less than half their dps?  What elitist scum!
---
Fiery enchant on a white dagger is the best leveling item, bar none, for any class until level 10, all because of how often fiery procs, and how the proc practically one shots low level mobs.
---
Lifesteal enchant on a second white dagger for non-healers, and your bandage use, eating time will decrease dramatically.
---
Spellpower enchant on a third white dagger and spirit enchant on a fourth white dagger for caster classes, so you can dot up or instant cast, before meleeing with the fiery enchant.
---
All stats enchant on white cloth chest piece.
---
Minor speed enchant on white cloth boots.
---
Armor enchant on a white cloak.
---
Gathering profession enchant on white gloves.
---
This will last until level 10, usually a few levels afterwards, before you need new gear.
---
I don't get why people keep saying druids are the underdog. We're not the best at dps, we're not the best at tanking and we're not the best at healing, which is EXACTLY the way its supposed to be. We are good at doing a little bit of all of those and synergistically we are as powerful as any other class. If we were really good at any one of those things, then we become pigeonholed into that task. Even in PVP, we are not bad, especially in BGs. Yeh we may not be able to "delete" characters but thats not really the point of a BG. We are fucking good at handling objectives though, which is what wins games.
---
I mean this is nice but you’re gonna need that loch modan flight path anyways.
---
Super late reply, I know, but you don’t how much I appreciate your response.  Straight up and saltless.  I’m glad there are at least a few of you guys out there, I don’t want good people turning away from the game because of the toxicity of this particular community can have from time to time.  I’ve made some good friends on reddit and in this sub in particular that are like minded.  Much obliged man, happy hunting on and after release.
---
Thanks, I figured it doesn't hurt to ask. So will we be able to play with Chinese client on EU/US servers (I know many will want to do this)? Sorry I have no idea about retail.
---
I just want the polish of classes/professions/items from TBC and port any Azeroth content into Classic+ (Kara, Zul'Aman, Hyjial, etc).
---
Not a super huge fan of a general advertisement and already plan on maining drood at launch, but love how concise you are. Too many people beat around the bush and you definitely have a well-structured and easy to get the main points video method :)
---
No, but since none of the people I knew took 8 days, and they were done leveling, it would be 7.5 is 25% of 10.
---
Achievements would be great. The archaeology profession kinda filled that void for me. 
---
Anything cross-faction is a turn off for me. Server communities and economies were a great, and often an unsung hero in the success of the game.
---
They didnt remove it they didnt add it
---
Doubt it, but goes without saying that our Icelandic bro's should join the Scandinavian realms.

Some of my best in-game friends were from Iceland, so I would be happy to see Icelandic guilds on the unofficial Scandinavian server.

This survey definitely isn't as interesting post beta. I feel like the data and experience we saw in beta will be far more representative compared to the poll here. 12.8% warlock. More druids than hunters. Lol yeah sure.
---
Paladin drop-off seems substantial...I remember them being a popular class in Vanilla, one of the most played but so far the survey has them down in the trenches...not enough "Paladins CAN" posts?
---
It's going to be more like 1000 gold sellers ruining the game for 10-100 players, making them cancel their subscription.

Blizzard loses in that case.

Why are these threads a thing? No hunters are asking how many hunters will be survival and not play their other specs.
---
Thex!!
---
There will be a significant number of new subscribers after launch who haven’t purchased the latest expansion.
---
Sorry dude, different guild! We were Alliance on Nagrand EU!
---
I dont know the admins etc of that group. Its just some dude here in Varberg who created it and invited all his friends and it snowballed. But if you hit me up in DMs when servers go public I can tell you which one we picked :) It'll be PvP.
---
glad to see you keep your uncles spirit alive ;)
---
To stop auto shot, I usually just turn away for a moment with the mouse. If you're looking away when an auto shot would fire, it'll de-toggle, and IMO that's often just the simplest (since I rarely use the auto shot-button, and so it doesn't get a hotkey).
---
Note: I'm not 100% sure on this, and can't check ATM, but I feel pretty sure that if you just clear your target by clicking on nothing, but still face the target, it'll automatically retarget and resume auto shot. So if you're firing at something, and the mage polymorphs it, it's not enough to just declick it, but doing a 180° as mentioned guarantees you won't be "that guy" breaking CC. This can also cancel Aimed Shot without losing your target, which *can* occasionally be useful
---
Hit 60 within 2 months. Complete raid content relatively soon after it comes out. Achieve PvP rank 11. Maybe put together a video or two for the YouTube.
---
That’s great, but what’s the song?
---
Charge -&gt; Dead. Never even saw the attack animations - for a brief moment I thought the guy was cheating.
---
The difference is in effort and design. I can't just go to an NPC and outfit my toon with gear that will last me the majority of the leveling process. I never played private servers but i doubt this is the meta for leveling alts like it is for retail. This is vastly more inefficient and spell power does scale with levels under 20 (just learned it today). No XP boost as well.
---
Yourmom
---
A warrior named Mage
---
Ditto good buddy
---
Sure, but you aim for the best and make up the rest. 
---
Of course a lock in a tank group would have to dps less. Its possible that you are 2 locking also (rare) in that case this is less of a worry. But i agree. 
---
What this still allows is mages, rogues, fury warriors, to do up to 20% (range 25%) more damage and for the melee it allows them to do +10-12% damage via buffs (before considering the utility of totems, ankh, and mana totems.)
---
Have you done it on a pserver recently? I will bet you reddit gold that you will not be 60 within a week of release.
---
Escape is important for PvP /shrug
---
I'd like to play horde too but I won't have enough time.
---
Would love to play an orc hunter
---
Where is this?
---
This is why I'm not taking days off since launch day. Launch day +3 is my plan.
---
Leveling tailoring and FA at the same time...ugh. I wait til 60 on my priest before touching FA since I can heal but I do eventually get after it.
---
Think my backup route for an orc will be...  
---
1) start in durotar, complete initial quest  
---
2) run north, hitting explorations till Orgrimmar  
---
3) hearth back, then go through hidden trail shammy questline route to get to ratchet  
---
4) pick up flight path, run towards crossroads  
---
5) grab flight path at crossroads, head south towards camp taurajo or w/e outside Mulgore  
---
6) grab flight path at border, bounce into Mulgore, set hearthstone to Bloodhoof village  
---
7) crawl to Camp Narache, work quests there/grind in Brambleblade Ravine
---
Should hit lvl 3ish perhaps in Mulgore, able to grind a plethora of Bristleback spawns if needed, then hearth back to the next quest hub. Judicious use of death/graveyard spawning near borders will help with travel times (getting close to orgrimmar, crossroads, maybe camp taurajo or w/e, and bloodhoof village)
---
or roll a Tauren ;) sounds like the majority of initial levelling problems for fresh servers are in durotar/elwynn/dun morogh starting zones
---
Hes right tho
---
Like when I encourage people to not listen to idiots so they waste their time leveling from 1-60 only to reroll or give up? 
---
Yeah, I do that
---
Well you wouldn't have to pool 75 rage with 3 warriors, right?
---
"Classic dev team has neither worked on Vanilla, nor played it."
---
Then please do tell me what this means.
---
You seem to expect US to know every single person on a dev team and what their previous projects were, yet you don't know yourself? How exactly are we supposed to find information about every developer on the Classic team if you can't even do it yourself? Not to mention that would be incredibly creepy.
---
It was never in Vanilla.  They implemented the Skirmishes with the TBC 2.0 patch... but 2.0 comes AFTER 1.12.
---
The pserver players claim raiding is so easy that everyone will be pugging Molten Core after the first week, so I can't see how your spec is really going to matter.
---
Even if it does, I expect there to be enough casual types out there who are down for just throwing a group together of whomever wants to tag along to see some raid action if I really want to.
---
No delay if it's in the same battle.net account, 30 days I think after you delete it for anyone else to use the name
---

---
Please do. I’d use the shit out of this.
---
Do we have to be subbed to create our characters?
---
He's wrong, berserking was and is off GCD
---
mages wont be going fire for a year and even then depending on the lock count they will. lol.
---
Low effort.
---
The best we can do is ride it into the sunset...
---
you think you do, but you don't
---
Thex
---
I laughed out loud, most truly, thanks.
---
Then don't care.
---
Yeah I was shocked to see how small of a percent were rational (aka 2-4 months). With that said, I was also shocked to see how many people are taking at least a week off of work.
---
Honestly, I got two lines in and realized you’re carrying on the same elite gamer fantasy you just spent some time googling a few things. Look, if you were an elite priest you would know hex isn’t highly valued because warriors and mages are two of the most highly played classes in pvp. This is in the same vein as dp being the iwin. In other words sure, if you’re trolling random kids in bg’s there’s a chance you might be able to get away with it, but in organized play (your reference) it’s next to worthless.  This is also why the video that you criticized went ud over troll. It’s a difference that becomes more obvious with experience. 
---
Anyway, I’m not reading any more. Sorry you spent so much time thread stalking me. If you I notice you continue that I’ll just block you. Have a good one and happy gaming,
---
See you in STV tho :-) will be fun again! respect to the guildmates tho
---
equal gear locks and druids both should beat mages majority of time.
---
16 hours a day for 7 days in a row... are you all alone in your life?
---
I somehow deserve this massive amount of downvotes (horde bois don’t have any kind of Humor I guess) I’m still surprised but I’ll get some help against my Facebook flu... or whatever.

I just wanted to state my respect

When people ask for water I'm going to tell them they need to turn me on first.
---
I’m 27 now. Before I did the PvP grind to rank 14. Prematurely quit at rank 13. My buddies and I took a week off from work to get some leveling in. Once I’m 60 I’m gonna try and PvP again. If my time doesn’t fit for it with work and a girlfriend (don’t think my previous rank is obtainable) I will go the PvP  route  and try raiding since I never did much of it in classic. 
---
I’ll always be pvping though. That’s what got me into the game at first
---
We should start a guild where we all join the same server and each member reserves a streamer name. Keep them all out
---
True
---
Its a fucking choose your own adventure dumbass, you're supposed to click on one of the three annotations at the end.
---
I suspect it's more practical to just call out "I am sundering X", and then do all the sunders. 
---
I haven't seen what sort of functionality you get out of addons like nugrunning (does it track buffs and debuffs on the unit nameplate that were not applied by you? I don't know.).
---
Also, you can get a sunder stack up in roughly 7.5 seconds, so I feel like it's doable, to get all your sunders up on "your" mob, before anyone needs to hit it. 
---
Really though, it will have to be field tested. I am kinda waiting for the stress test before I go hard into getting addons and macros set up.
---
That was MoP, not WoD.
---
Im with you so much bra
---
Thanks for the reply. Still going to roll Priest.
---
I have the week off. Fiancé will be working. I’m hitting the gym early morning. Then playing. I’ll have my sandwiches good to go. Then be off at a decent time so I can get to bed early. Rinse and repeat.
---
Its all about gear
---
love u bb

The horde is intruding in night elven territory, this is what the cows get

I keep getting ads for funeral services. Everyone else is getting this, right? Right??
---
Bg queue for sure. Zero rep requirement for faction mounts. Free respec.And that glyph that makes you not a moonkin.
---
Layering will fix that
---
Shit I work 75% remote, I hadn’t even considered how much fishing I can get done between tasks. Hell yes.
---
&gt; It has been posted in many places the average play time to hit 60 is 10 days played. Nobody batted an eye at that but people seem to be going batshit over me saying it's roughly 240 hours played.
---
I think people are muddling the minimum time to get to sixty if you do absolutely nothing except speedlevel on an optimum, uncontested route, which is closer to five days than ten, and the realistic time to get to sixty for people who play normally. 
---
People who go on dungeon runs that wipe, level up their first aid and fishing and cooking inefficiently, spend hours trying to find the last few mining or herbing nodes they need to get those last few green skill points, leave that one quest item they needed in the bank, run out of ammo or pet food in the middle of nowhere, get jumped by respawn and die, try to solo a three-pull and die, try to solo an elite quest and die, have a good idea about how to do that elite quest on the second try and die again, rez and get jumped by a patrol and die, rez again and realise half their gear is broken and die, take the graveyard rez and have ten minutes of rez sickness, take a zeppelin to Undercity to train guns before realising the trainer is in Thunder Bluff, spend fifteen minutes killing whatsits waiting for a foozit to drop before realising they are killing the wrong whatsits and all that kind of time-wasting stuff that almost all of us always do.
---
Are they willing to pay a full monthly sub for it though? Nostalrius was the biggest one by far and that was an outlier, so it isn't a huge audience to begin with.
---
And private servers will still exist, and still be cheaper (or free) compared to Classic.
---
A lot of people don't even pay for Retail WoW either since you can make gold and sell tokens pretty easily, something that is impossible in Classic which makes it the more expensive choice out of all 3 ways of playing WoW.
---
Warrior named BraveSirRobin
---
I am gonna farm MCPs for EVERY RAID.
---
It's labelled as a stun but its behaviour is more of an incap since any damage breaks the effect afaik. Still very strong, no doubt about it, but comparing it to 31pt talents... is a mistake imo. It is much better to compare it with other profs: youre trading goldmaking, gear, and much more for that grenade, the dragonling and the aoe bomb, other engi stuff is rather underwhelming.
---
God damn blizzard and their private servers!
---
That was sad.
---
I mean the most recent one is literally at the top of the sub right now.
---

Well I've already racked up 30 hours on fire emblem this weekend so it shouldn't take me more than a month.

I am so surprised that everyone is going so against the suggestion. 
---
I agree, Classic should also available with a cheaper subscription. 
---
No one would pay a remastered game the same price as the original one. 
---
Also, if you only want to play one version, why would you have to pay for the other?
---
Do I have to pay a subscription for FF XIV if I just want to play to FF XI ?
---
I am aware that it is not the same game but Classic WoW is not really the same game as BFA is neither...
---
Also, I already know a bunch of people who would not get on WoW Classic because of that but would be okay to pay something like 8$ a month or so...
---
Just do this: 15$ for both and add X$ for Classis-Only.
---
Likewise, friend.
---
You haven't done the wife/husband and kids yet then?
---
I've managed to negotiate 2 nights during the week and 1 night at the weekend for gaming. If anyone wants any tips hit me up!
---
Sure no prob, my time was on a rogue btw and it was my second time doing 1-60 on a rogue, and fourth time doing 1-60 (done druid and mage before)
---
If you just roll to the next expansion every time you get to the end of progression though, where do you stop? Eventually we'll just get to modern day WoW if we keep going, so at some point you need to draw a line and actually deal with the problem of content droughts properly. New expansions don't solve the problem, they only prolong/delay it. People fought for Classic, not TBC or Wrath, so it makes sense to just keep it  Classic for me. If you go to TBC or Wrath and then draw a line, you've bypassed what people fought so long and so hard for: Classic.
---
There are 4 raid teams (morning, noon, etc ). So just your raid team.
---
When will you decide realm so I can avoid it as I am not nordic.
---
I read it, and yes, there are some outspoken people on it, but many of them having posted between 20 and 133 times. So the number of replies overall is a little swayed by a few dozen passionate people.

---
I’ll be pretty casual overall. Still will tank, but will be a lot of 5-mans rather than raid. So goals will be to enjoy the leveling process and dungeons. Make an Imperial plate set cause it’s sexy. Hit 60. Collect and upgrade the Valor/Tier .5 set. It’s also sexy. Moreso than the Tier 1 or 2 sets for warriors, tbh. 3 is nice but I’ll not be able to get that unless Classic is still going in 30 years when I retire.
---
If I say it out loud... someones gonna take it....
---
Neat project! 
---
Looks like UBRS is missing (and is a part of the LBRS map)?
---
That's very much on blizzard for answering the question like a turd, if that's how they want us to read that answer.
---
LEEEROOOYYYYYYYYY
---
Hey man quick question did you test the death skip from drowning on beta servers while they were active?
---
After testing a path from Valley of Trials to Camp Narache on beta and on private servers the spirit healer locations you could be sent too from dying in the same spot were very different.
---

---
Berserking is definitely not on the GCD.
---
Remind me of suggesting my sister to name her cat "dog"
---
A blanket statement concering the entirety of the Classic dev team now means "majority of the people"? Didn't know you had the power to change the meaning of words, impressive.
---
You're not asking people that work on Classic, you're asking us to find information about them and what they worked on, very different.
---
K, confirmed troll or mentally handicapped. The tinfoil hattery is just too much for me.

I didn't think beta was currently active? Or did you test on a pserver?

People complain about the retail version not being aware that it is mostly because of economical reasons that it is shit now...
---
Now, they are so keen to pay for the old version...
---
Ironic.
