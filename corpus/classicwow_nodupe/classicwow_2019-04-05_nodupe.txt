It's about a week old and Classic hasn't launched yet.
---

---
The issue is that there's not a big private server community and honestly I'm okay with that as I'm not wanting the Discord associated with breaking the ToS.
---
Our Classic talks should spike once we have an announced date and we'll be gathering guides and videos from Vanilla. A big thing holding us back is we're unsure how true to the past Classic will actually be in regards to XP rewards from mobs and quest. The plan is for everything to be close, but we wont know for sure until Launch.
---
---
---
So are ya going alliance or horde?
---
Sick set up btw 
---
lmfao that vid
---
lol yeah you and I are 100% the same on this. "How did you find me" is the best. Always respond by saying "well you're a *class* in the level range of our group". Pretty obvious lol
---
Oh shoot thanks cake day bot! 
---
Why would anyone pay for your guide when Joanna's will be free? If you really think your "thousands" of hours of testing makes your route substantially faster, he will just steal your route and update his guide.
---
Charging for a pdf in 2019 lmao. Your guide will be leaked and hosted for free online anyway.
---
The og vanilla soundtrack has got to be the most iconic game music ever made 
---
Maybe it's because it's extremely new, I didn't know that... but the other reasons don't add up. 
---
We know most XP rewards from quests and mobs via video proof a la Joana, and there are servers with near perfect replication- testers just avoid the 'bugged' mobs (such as summoned imps yielding near full xp, etc) and quests (if any).   
---
If the server isn't interested in private server tests / yields (really doesn't have to be explicit, but I can see the hesitation) then... I'm not sure what a Classic Power Leveling discord is supposed to talk about until launch.
---
The **worst** thing they could do in terms of setting up an RP-PVP server is to actually wait until after launch to get one started. RP players aren't going to want completely discard their character, who they're connected to (the **whole point of RP**), and start all over anew. Hell, I don't think even non-RP players want to do that! If you introduce an RP-PVP server after Classic's launch, it'll be dead on arrival. If you introduce RP-PVP server with launch, it'll probably have one of the most healthy and stable populations out of all the servers. Literally no reason at all to not have even just one at launch. 
---
That was very well explained, thanks!
---
Maybe he doesn't want competition in his favorite gold grind spots...? I wouldn't worry about it, it was fun to click through :)
---
For years I always wondered where in the game this was, so thanks for this haha.
---
All my math assumes general easy to get quest rewards 1-60. With luck, I'll get drops along the way, and I've got things I'm eyeing as potential things to keep an eye out for on the AH on my bank alt.
---
My assumptions for gear:
---
- 1-7: basic 1.4 DPS starting hammer. I don't do any killing 1-10, so no biggie.
---
- 8-17: 8.3 DPS [Coldridge Hammer](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3103) from "Protecting the Herd" quest in Dun Morogh.
---
- 18-33: 18.2 DPS [Orc Crusher](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6093) from quest in Redridge
---
- 34-43: [Silver Spade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4128) from quest in STV
---
- still working on more, but assuming ~39 DPS for 44-51, and ~48DPS from 52-59, still working on routing for specific quests.
---
I can speak alliance side and assume it's the same horde side, and this is for a cat while levelling:
---
Do your hunter quests, and pick up pet skills from pet trainer
---
Learn Claw 2 from an appropriate starter area beast
---
Tame cat and train Growl
---
Level with your pet until it gains first loyalty level
---
Train stam, armor, claw
---
Get level 12 skills from pet trainer
---
Level with your pet until it gains second loyalty level
---
Train stam, armor
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
From here, make a plan to train stam, armor, and level 1 resistances. The resistances are important because they help your pet resist not only damage but fear, roots etc
---
Continue to learn Claw and then Bite upgrades from appropriate beasts and train your pet
---
You'll start to be short of points levelling midway. At this point, prioritise stam and armor, and try to nab higher fire resistance as this damage tends to be very high
---
Don't forget there is no need to reset points. The pet skill tree shows total points taken by a higher level of skill, but doesn't mention that it discounts the number of points you have already invested in that skill. Eg Skill 1 is 5 points, Skill 5 is 30 points - if you have Skill 1 trained already, then when you train Skill 5 it only costs 25 points.
---
Have fun!
---
Startes gnome rogue. Will be going human rogue this time around. Absolutely stoked.
---
Also the only time you make resetting pet points a priority is when you tame a new pet with skills already there that you don't want, eg Cower, because this takes up points automatically and can hinder you training other things.
---
What the difference if you’re charging people for full access if you’re trying to force people into donating for full access?
---
Rogue/rogue is ridiculous if your both dagger.
---
I’m actually a lefty too, but was introduced to PC’s pretty early in 199X and the first thing I did on them was mess with the Paint app which needed the use of a mouse. It was uncomfortable, but just as with everything else, I learned over time.
---
Come to think of it, I imagine I’d be MUCH better at aiming if I had started out with a left handed mouse 😋
---
Same here. I'll be rooting for him to get first 60.
---
There's a tab up top for guild
---
So we dont know if the cap was actually 2500?
---
Doubt it, the current plan I'm going with is stopping at IF, pick up the flight path, and set my hearthstone there before going to Darnassus.
---
Yes please I want them. And not for ERP, neither. In the past 12 years I fell into tabletop gaming and I really like the storytelling aspect. I want to be I M M E R S E D in the rich world of warcraft. 
---
My list of priorities for each class:
---
Druid casters-wis, kings, salv, light  
---
Feral-might, kings, salv, light  
---
Hunter-wis, kings, salv, light  
---
Mage-wis, kings, salv, light  
---
Paladin-wis, kings, salv, light  
---
Priest-wis, Kong’s, salv, light  
---
Rogue-might, kings, salv, light  
---
Warlock-**salv**,kings, wis, light  
---
Warrior-salv, might, Kings, light  
---
Tank-Sanc, Kings, light, might
---
I go to the next blessing for each paladin in the group/raid.  Also, move salv up if people don’t know what aggro is and why they keep tanking.
---
If tons of people are hell-bent on doing that then let them. Go do a Dungeon or something while they hash it out? Even as a 8 year old kid I remember people discussing the then-POTUS George Bush. Yeah its annoying but we shouldn't regulate anything by a /right-click report button. That's stupid.
---
The really frustrating thing about being in this position of being viewed as such a niche community is Blizzard never really gave it a chance to be anything else. RPvP servers weren't a thing until 1.8, nearly a year after WoW launched, by which point most of those who might have been interested in such a realm type had already established themselves on other servers. Sure, some people made the jump, but I'd wager a whole lot more decided it wasn't worth sacrificing all that investment and the connections they'd there.
---
The only way to truly judge how much of a demand there is for RPvP servers is to make them available *at launch.* Otherwise you'll simply be repeating the selfsame mistake that hamstrung the popularity of RPvP the first time 'round.
---
Personally, I'd prefer there be at least two such servers in each major region so I and those like me can play both factions, but I'd be willing to settle for one at launch simply so we can prove there's a real demand for them.
---
I genuinely believe, if RPvP is available at launch, the folks at Blizzard will be blown away by how popular a choice it is. I'm not claiming it'll eclipse regular Pve or PvP servers, but I'm confident it will be at least as popular as RP.
---
And if I'm wrong and it truly is a tiny niche community I'll come back here, make a post linking to all the times I made the above claim then publicly eat my crow and shut up about it forevermore.
---
This is a great answer.  
---
There are definitely things you can do maximize your time investment//income ratio, but the thing is that a shit load of people really want to do the same thing.
---
Think outside the box, explore//test areas, but most importantly find something that can be YOURS.
---
&gt;PTR in TBC
---
&gt;character is level 80
---
hmmmmm
---
40-45 is great 46-50 is slow and painful, you have Tanaris + couple of quest chains in hinterlands to polish off but once you hit that 46 area there isn't much room to finish off that bracket without Searing Gorge quests.
---
I Personally think 50-60 is the best feeling. You're smashing out the last couple of levels but it flows super well Felwood -&gt; WPL -&gt; Winterspring -&gt;EPL and throw in some Burning steps if you're Alliance for the ony chain + quest to Winterspring, All that delicious XP.
---
Haha for sure dude gonna be dooooope
---
&gt;We know most XP rewards from quests and mobs via video proof a la Joana, and there are servers with near perfect replication- testers just avoid the 'bugged' mobs
---
Private servers might be exceptionally close to what Classic brings, the thing is until Launch there's no way for knowing 100% and in a non-scaled WoW being able to predict your XP is crucial to ensuring you don't outlevel a zone before finishing quest which could put you into a massive mob grind.
---
&gt;I'm not sure what a Classic Power Leveling discord is supposed to talk about until launch.
---
Right now, it's about the same as this sub. There's not a lot we can do except bathe in nostalgia and wait. However, if you look at the rest of our channels there's a ton of interactions and questions and we expect Classic to be the same come Launch which is why I'm hoping to bring more awareness to it.
---
Yea it's understandable, I've just seen so many BFD groups fall apart right before Kelris. Bad pulls leads to a wipe and if you take too long trash will respawn and your group disbands.
---
Awesome set up but think it would look better choosing a faction :) 
---
Yup noticed it aswell when I first watched BB, and it's not totally removed, it still plays on retail in RFD with the dancing skeleton boss.
---
You mean the stats do matter, which is why half the items, including tier sets, are some of the worst items you can get because they aren’t itemized correctly. 
---
I don't use turn on the keyboard but have strafe and forward bound.  Depending on preference you can bind s to back or a hotkey.  But I always avoid turning with the k/b.  That's the slow thing.
---
This is part of what made Classic a more social game than current retail. You had to talk to people, but you had all the tools to do so. It definitely made each server more of a community, but also made low pop servers hard to find groups on.
---
Thanks! Yeah, you're probably right,  the thing is, there are so many videos out there that go over the grind spots.
---
Somewhat similar, there is an Outkast song that uses an iconic everquest spell sound. I can find it if anyone's interested.
---
Mechanically? There isn't one.
---
It's an entirely illogical and emotional thing that I'm not sure I can fully explain. Even a paypal "Buy me a coffee," sits better than $20 for a guide that says run to Westfall.
---
I'd prefer to heal in the context of Raids. Heck, I'd prefer to heal period. The hiccup is that I'm leveling with 4 life-long IRL friends who are rolling Warrior, Rogue, Druid, and Shaman. Thus the issue; Mage makes significantly more sense in the context of leveling and doing countless dungeons with them/that group comp. Not that it would be game-breaking for me to roll Priest, just that Mage probably makes much more sense. Not that it would be too awful if we:  
---
\- Druid (Tank)  
---
\- Warrior (DPS)  
---
\- Rogue (DPS)  
---
\- Shaman (Elem DPS)  
---
\- Priest (Heals)  
---
...but I'm sure the ports, free water/food, and sheep would be sorely missed by all. T\_T
---
Just "SUMMER"
---
Don't forget you can also buff pets
---
And my PC which came in the mail still sits unassembled behind me 1 week later.  
---
Fuck me I knew something sounded familiar about that music
---
Misspelling rogue is a prerequisite to playing a rogue
---
I mean, half mana is fine. Either that dungeons taking an extra hour. 
---
Not precisely, they've never told us. All we know is that its probably roughly around there, and that whatever number they chose was an explicit design decision. 
---
I'd really like to hear it!
---
I have no problem with you producing an alliance guide for free.
---
And that's very ungenerous to say of Joana, he isn't the kind of person who appropriates other people's work for his own.
---
&gt; Private servers might be exceptionally close to what Classic brings, the thing is until Launch there's no way for knowing 100% 
---
Well.. testing something that has 95% accuracy is pretty damn exceptional for, again, testing. We *do know* many things. As I said, these servers have begun being much more rigorous with their values and referencing *known* sources, such as the complete 1-60 play through Joana provided. This gives EXP values for exploration, mobs, and quests. You can be 95% certain of a route, and any discrepancy is easy to account for under the 2 circumstances: 1) we are given a full 1-60 test period of Classic, or 2) Launch, in which case the first power levelers will collect the data and it will be passed down within a month or two. The 1st scenario is unlikely, and the 2nd doesn't help the first-week of power leveling, which is the most crucial.
---
&gt; Right now, it's about the same as this sub. 
---
Er. Then I was definitely wrong in joining such a niche discord if it's scope is that of a completely jumbled subreddit...
---
I use ES(D)F, same as WASD but it allows me to use more keybinds
---
Just seeing that hat with that font ruined it for me 
---
My A, S and D keys are bound to spells. Each having a shift-_ and alt-_ variant as well. I use Q W and E only, using my mouse to turn. Its super easy to 360 around casters so they miss their spells. (I only play warrior lol)
---
The cap in vanilla was 4k people:

As far as we know server pop was dynamic around 3-3.5k
---
Oh maybe I'm looking at this wrong. I have a set of armor that has both agility and intellect, but when im in balance spec, the agility is grayed out and its intellect. intellect is grayed out and agility is highlighted when im in feral. Guess it just means it has both of those stats but only one is relevant.
---
Also, I can literally click activate on a spec and it changes over to that spec. its 10 seconds. Like I can have every spec and swap between them all. you used to have to pay to be even dual spec. 
---
You mean the three cans? 
---
How "hardcore" were RP and RP-PVP servers? I like RP, but whenever people tried to do it in video games it kinda fell apart.
---
I played in a PVE server in vanilla so I never got to experience it. Did people actually RP?
---
lol Look at you getting killed over writing a harmless post. 
---
They underestimated spell dmg when balancing vanilla items and so spell dmg items are generally much better. 
---
underrated comment
---
no, no they don't 
---
He won't, his gameplay is not up to pair but he's a really solid guide maker.
---
Server first will be a mage btw.
---
There will be more saturation by then.  Go alchemy and make arcanite bars.
---
Wow thanks Khajiit. I’m just super excited about the game and I love this subreddit. I want to contribute to conversations and share ideas. Of course I’m not trying to force changes. Thanks for “sticking up for me”. What I think is good is if someone says “what do you guys think about this” and people say no and explain why, or maybe they like the idea and say yes. That’s what blizzard is looking at. 
---
Oh cool! Thanks.

Sorry but that's how speedrunning works in every genre. if someone posts a better time you research their run and incorporate their strategies into your own.
---
ITT: fake outrage at the hat, but then you noticed the text
---
I didn’t know that. That’s pretty awesome. 
---
I assume the "no changes!" people will want to raid  Naxx and wander sithilius for years on end. 
---
How do we know it was a design decision? I always heard it was decided by hardware limitations. 
---
In doing option 2, you can no longer use Winterspring teleport and world enlarger once going goblin, correct? But you can use everything else?
---
Clearly the OP is a two-time opportunist, a polyaffiliationist.
---
It would certainly be weird for them to drop off after giving an update every week, but they have an out in that they never said that was the plan.  Guess we will know soon enough.  
---
Based 30yo boomer
---
It wasn't just your server. Most if not all did if I remember correctly. I'm not sure why, tbh, because Dire Maul came out later but that's how it was. 🤷‍♀️
---
Thanks for the response. I agree some of the new music is great. Like a more orchestral version of the original song. I love both versions. Other songs are a bit too dark for vanilla. 
---
So Jellyyy

But wait....

Where’s the Code Red Mountain Dew?!?!

I myself am making the switch from Ally to Horde.  I think tauren, orcs and trolls are still filthy and vile. So, playing Forsaken seems like the best option. For Sylvanas!

You can literally click the 3 dots on YT and tell YT you arent interested in those videos, then click "Why" and say you *DONT LIKE THIS CHANNEL*  and you will never see these youtubers again.

This is such a non issue to be so whiny about. I don't get it.
---
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING!?
---
I heard that Black Lotus nodes have fixed spawns and I really wish the Black Lotus spawns were randomized this time around because having known nodes that can be camped sounds really shitty

This. Buffs and world bosses were the only real reason we stayed at org but everybody knew Kargath was the real hub haha.

And the "Wasting The Best Bind Keys" award goes too.......
---
I believe either John Staats or Mark Kern or both confirmed the cap number in ClassiCast #13, but haven't got time to sift through the 3+ hour podcast.
---
PSA: when they finally announce the release date, just assume the first day or two will feature lots of downtime. 
---
For years, I watched friends and guildmates take launch Tuesdays off, then lose their minds and rant in our forums as servers invariably went up and down or suffered from lag issues. 
---
It's been a little better for recent launches, but if you're seriously thinking of taking time off for the classic release, I'd take off that Thursday and Friday for a long weekend, not that Tuesday (assuming it launches on a Mon/Tue). The odds are probably more in your favor of getting more stable servers to play on. 
---
Hell yeah I loved our hunter chat. One of my favorite raiding memories was my class leader erupting in laugher over vent, and apologizing while catching his breath, citing " Gifted (me) just said some mad funny shit in hunter chat"
---
Yes. Though the effects of them were different for my guild. Some of them turned into cliques/sub-factions where officers were criticized and people were made fun of. All well and good to keep drama off raid chat and let people blow off steam.  That is until one of the guys trying to suck up to a female officer told her about it.  She was rightfully a primary target of criticism, but she didn't like having her 'authoritah' challenged. People were g-kicked, others left, guild scattered to the wind. Buh-bye progression. 
---
Note: I was not involved as I was an officer and innocent priest ignorant of such activities until they come to light.
---
Okay so what about channels that produce some good content but also produce nonsense filth like this? Calm yourself nerd 
---
Ok I may be crazy, but the beginning of ATLiens by outkast sounds like an evocation nuke type spell in EQ.

I'm not an RPer, but I agree that all RPers should be served like the rest of the Classic community. /solidarity
---
Okay come on you should know better then to comment with this. This is for higher tier of content such as raiding and such. Tanks blame healers too often, you should know this as a paladin. Also paladin tanks are incredibly squishy so it doesn't surprise me seeing as i did try it on my paladin on ND.

I have a group of about 15 irl friends from middle school and high school. All of us are assigning ourselves into duos essentially. The only other person going undead is a warlock, so we'll be doing warrior/warlock. Battleshout for pet, healthstones, different gear, cool looking. 
---
What does bank alts required mean?
---
It doesn't really matter what anyone's mindset it. It becomes very obvious 5 minutes into any instance how much CC is necessary. It depends on each group. CCing when there's no need to is just as silly aas not CCing when you need to.

Friday in Europe though. 
---
Honestly I'd love to see the vanilla world finished. Soooo many unfinished zones and portals back then.
---
In the end all the zones got finished in retail I think, and all the other unfinished stuff just got removed. 
---
I probably wouldn't be against the retail zones being added as level 60 content, but not the cataclysm changes to the current content.
---
Level 60 40 man Hyjal, and 20 man Kara would be nice since they are part of the old world.
---
All other portals getting new raids could be content specifically made and balanced for both classic and retail like the emerald dream.

Still have my copy somewhere.... I must dig it up before classic launches!

I have a hunch we get the release date tomorrow. My spidey senses are tingling.

Why a mage? Am I OotL? Always heard hunters were the fastest by a solid margin.

Friday in most of Asia and Africa
---
Honest question, how did u get the money to start a tea place at 25?
---
Pretty normal for 40mans. It's just too many people to have in one channel. It's probably smarter to group it by melee dps/ranged dps/healer etc because a lot of those roles overlap. Like if you want to setup a interrupt rotation you need to be talking to rogues and warriors, or if you want a kite rotation you need mages and hunters.
---
Maybe it got sampled and ended up at some production music vendor, with the producers of Breaking Bad having no idea that it originally came from a game named WoW. Happens more than you think in these industries. The C&amp;C Tiberium Wars OST for example is being used quite often in small productions such as reality TV and stuff. Heard it multiple times.
---
Wow you successfully read the first sentence of the op. That’s impressive. 
---
Came to light? should have specced shadow. ;)
---
Do you live by the sea?
---
That's a common rocket/firing sound. I swear that same sound is in Conker's bad fur day
---
Long time Hewlett here going a lot of adoring aspiring tracks read your post :)
---
Agreed! It is a skill people will need to get used to again.
---
Aoe farming is theoretically the fastest way to level, especially if you can get out ahead of everyone else. 
---
Agreed my dude it is a thankless job, and it isn't easy either. But the point is a lot of tanks get jaded and toxic the longer they tank. I am trying to prevent that.
---
Fair enough, I didn't scroll to the right so I didn't see it.  It's pretty easy to get skillups disenchanting by offering in trade to disenchant peoples' items for them for free.
---
That explains a lot about how a huge chunk of this sub-Reddit acts.

---
"World bosses will not be kite-able"
---
Aww. That's a point against rolling hunter. Wanted to kite dragons to cities. Fun times when it could be done. 
---
Oh man I completely forget about these! What'll be really fun is seeing people accidentally pulling the trench going down to the last boss. SOOO many wipes from people getting too close to the edge and then 30+ mobs training on you with AoE reflecting robots. 
---
You can't really say the Outkast song uses an everquest sound when the Outkast song came out before everquest.
---
I just find it funny that op mentions his timezone and acknowledges how it's specific to his location (literally in his first sentence), and apparently that's enough to trigger you and get aggressive. Maybe stay away from public roads today ok?
---
Bleh!
---
I won't be afraid to google things but a guide? Bleh I say. 
---
Some people are treating this release like a goddamn job. I can't comprehend it. 
---
And at the time it gave that LotR Khazad-dûm vibe.
---
If I were Alliance I'd prefer Stormwind though in terms of look, OST and overall atmosphere. But as a Horde I prefer Alliance being in IF, otherwise how else can we raid SW?
---
Triggered and aggressive? You're fantastic
---
One of the most hilarious PVP videos I watched was a troll rogue ganking people in STV, but instead of the usual I’m so cool metal/rock music it was ridiculously cheesy happy music. I wonder if I can find it again. 
---
My Benediction became Anathema permanently once I became a ronin. 
---
WoW, the place where doing chores feels less burdensome and more rewarding than in real life.
---
People have treated WoW like a job since the Beta. Is what it is.
---
Did NOT know this was a thing. And I've played from Vanilla to WoD.
---
Yes hello, I would like to order one RP-PVP server please.
---
It does add a certail flavor to the game at least. Nothing like roleplaying a pirate warrior at level with while sporting the Swashbuckler Sash.

The majority of data on vanilla raiding comes post tbc launch. Raiding wasn't hard in vanilla, we just had no idea what we were doing.
---
Joanna's wasn't free and still won't be free if you go for the associated addons that he supplies for paid customers. 
---
OP posts *Usually I wake up Friday (Aussie here) *    
---
You reply *Friday for you, maybe. Thursday for everyone else that lives on Earth, aka not Australia.*  
---
You quite literally repeated back to him what he said with an aggressive ton, apparently angry that he lives in another country from you. Yup I'm definitely the one with the problem.
---
Gnomes get port to gadgetzan, and yes you do lose ability to use it as well as world enlarger.
---
Yeh I had a rogue friend that joined us for leveling dungeons from like lvl25 up when I was releveling last year on a pserver. He loved that he could open up on skull and because I was competent he rarely ever pulled aggro from me for more than half a second when I was tab sundering. 
---
No tier bonus can come anywhere close to the awesomeness of turning into a giant angry tiger.  
---
Yup, and with all the servers out there the chances of a good mage getting the farm for himself is pretty high, that mage will win the race.
---
No one cares.
---
Man... it just clicked. I suddenly remember 1.12 as a "fix" so warriors wouldn't be left behind the power curve for leveling during BC. In fact, now I'm wondering if they didn't have to nerf some things a few weeks after release...  
---
Blarg. That ruins everything. Classic is broke.
---
The meta for things are still changing monthly. The small differences between thr classic released by Blizzard and what people are familiar with will make even more changes.
---
“Homie gear” 😂
---
&gt; Pretty quickly after the announcement they made about plans for servers at launch (at the time, no RP server was planned).
---
I do not remember this at all, and I was under the impression I'd kept up with things relatively well. Do you happen to have a link?
---
You don’t always need a second you should start pooling rage after getting a few sunders on each target. I also used taint a lot near the end of someone grab a aggro on the last monster so I could pool rage without losing aggro. I always aim to try and end fight with 25ish rage about the time bloodfury comes off cooldown to pop it in between groups to keep a healthy amount of rage. 
---
SWAMP OF SORROWS IS ABOUT TO BE DRAINED
---
Buffs easier on private server? Yes, the CD of WCB and onyxia buff has been removed.
---
Spawn rates are not "jacked up" on private servers. They are dynamic, meaning that things spawn faster if there's more players, these private servers that use this, has a lot more players than the cap back in vanilla. In fact, consumables are more expensive on pservers than they were in vanilla.
---
Lastly, there being more herbs and ores does not cause inflation. The overpowered gold generating farm spots like maruadon and diremaul AOE farm causes inflation.
---
People back in vanilla did not typically world buff. However private servers simply found out that using worldbuffs makes everything faster and smoother, and thus it became "meta" to do so.
---
Does overusing buffs make the game easier? No it doesn't because private servers remove world buffs for new raids for the first month, and they are still cleared hours after launch despite having higher armor values.
---
Whatever the lower number of priests are I'm there 
---
Ruffled pretty easy eh?
---
If you find one who gets free priest buffs and innervates as part of a team its 100% mage. If hunter isn't level 50 or 52 by the time the mage hits level 45ish the hunter already lost I think.
---
Ouch. Sorry to hear. I have seen LCD's that only lasted 2 years, but something about those early Samsungs...
---
I seriously doubt that anyone has actually abused buffs and innervate like that. 
---
You need the Human Spirit to guide you though!
---
If healers can get by with pots and demonic runes, I think hunters probably can, too.
---
Playing a human priest in vanilla is like raiding and snow white with the 7 dwarves around you 
---
what? im not talking about alliance...
---
I loved grinding on the beach in Tanaris. The blue water looked so good and I enjoyed fighting pirates.
---
Tanks, always tanks.
---
I hope your guide does well. Would be great if you make first solo player to 60.
---
Except you would save Stoneform for Blind, and not Garrote. So you are incorrect.
---
This is awesome to hear, I'm going Troll Priest and my girlfriend is going Troll Hunter. I felt like the combo would work well but it is good to hear confirmation!
---
Alliance because orgrimmar gives me OCD
---
Gimme that GREEN pill on my warrior!
---
Very widely used features, even for classes that didnt usually need it like Druids and Warlocks. Cliques definitely did form because of it, a lot of complaints about other classes within a class channel. Its still used by (I think) most guilds on pservers. I dont think theyre necessary, but helpful if your guild is a bit disorganized.
---
Haha I tanked a pserver and anytime dps started saying gogogo I was like we go slow we go steady we don’t wipe and we save time. They generally shut up and let me and my healer cousin run the show. Of course I’m the type of tank using raid markers in WC and dictating Cc be used
---
Your gonna start a riot man be careful
---
Ok, so instead of 1.12+ or a TBC re-release, what about using a reboot? I mean, I wouldn't mind TBC/WoTLK re-releases, but Cata... meh - and there's no WAY I would ever play mists again...  
---
So why not restructure the timeline altogether? The Bronze Dragonflight could reset things easily enough. Why not even launch the entire world back into the first invasion with Rhonan, where we could fight the Burning Legion alongside Broxigar and Krasus - where the dragons are at their best, with an opportunity to completely reset the timeline, maybe even altering the affects of the dragon soul, launching a new effort to stop Deathwing before he ever has a chance to use it?
---
Always like hanging out in Winterspring at 50+. Such a cool zone with a lot of places to explore and great atmosphere.
---
For the Dark Lady!
---
Impressive... Most impressive.
---
Big mood brother.
---
Make American Great Again though.
---
well, that doesnt matter for me. you want to be at home ready to play when servers go up and not at work. its just a magic moment.
---
This makes sense too
---
I know for group content it should be totally useless but as a kid in vanilla it felt like having an excess of a weird stat could actually affect how you handle situations. Like spirit was sleeper op for warrior leveling 
---
Any source to confirm mob pets shouldn’t yield xp? Would love to read a bout the mechanics.
---
I think you mean 'triggered and aggressive'
---
Get to the bottom of the forge room in bc people yelling gogogo tank and healer just chilling waiting on that pat most people forget about that can wipe you in the next tunnel. 
---
Tank chat is raid group 1, if you’re the lucky Warlock and Shaman, you get to be in tank chat. 
---
It’s very situational which makes pally buffs fun and interesting.
---
I forgot you can't Express yourself with some shittbag telling you they have gone uphill both ways in molten core. 
---
\*picture of obnoxious kid with knife in head and knife handle sticking out appears\*
---
Honestly the earth is flat and every Aussie is an actor. 
---
The amount of level 1 bank alts required to horde all of the mats. I plan on levelling with mining and skinning and hording mats to power lw and eng to 300 when i hit 60. It includes the 16 slot main bag and bank space, no extra bags. So you could use less alts by having bags on them.
---
But there will need to be an eventual end, or continuation.
---
Time will tell how profitable it is for blizzard, to do one or the other.
---
(End as in, maybe transition to TBC, or continuation, in continue the classic storyline with the other zones)
---
The previous post said tank is a core part of warrior. Which I was avidly disagreeing with. I don't see how you got confused
---
Hail Arthas...!!
---
Except Egg boy, he's a real mofo
---
&gt; A great example would be the Soulsborne series. I don't know if you're a fan, but I can guarantee you that 95% of the playerbase would agree that multiple difficulties would absolutely ruin the experience of those games on almost every level. 
---
Disagree.  Bloodbourne's easy mode, otherwise known as Ludwig's Holy Blade, was perfectly fine for a 1st playthrough. -_o
---
I want to level a gnome warrior in Teldrassil to get the night elf mounts early on, but I also really want to do the Westfall and Deadmines quest lines. Leveling was harder back then, so even with doing all the level appropriate night elf quests - I should probably still be able to head over and do parts of those quests and then head back, right?
---
Horde because night elves run like retards and I don’t want any part of it.
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. I don’t think the analogy works. 
---
The Mona Lisa still exists, vanilla doesn’t. 
---
Leo repainting over the original would be analogous to them repainting retail, which they are not doing. 
---
...because people are playing private servers, or claim to have knowledge about something they never experienced.   
---
And just FYI, 1.12 warriors were a fraction of vanilla. Anyone who played a warrior pre-1.12 knows that Classic being based off of the 1.12 version of warriors - hell, even 1.8 - was a heck-of-a lot easier than 90% of the vanilla experience.  
---
You couldn't even get a raid invite pre-1.8 unless you were at least an offtank. Nearly 2/3's of everyone who rolled a warrior, re-rolled within the first 3-6 weeks. And even when TBC was released, very few guilds used fury warrior DPS at all. So how am I wrong?
---
[Make your own keyboard.](http://blakesmith.me/2019/01/16/making-my-own-usb-keyboard-from-scratch.html) Would be a bitch in compatibility also needing to use a laptop though.
---

---
That still leaves ZG buff, DM buffs and Songflower. All are miles away from Blackrock Mountain.
---
You're right, it must have been Wrath. I only thought TBC because looking at myself on the mount I used mostly in TBC made me think that's when it's from.
---
TFW its coming summer of 2020 not 2019 and we all got bamboozled
---
What's so great about RP-PvP servers? Don't think I've ever played on any type of RP server.
---
Stamina being good does not make spirit not good.
---
In the spirit of /r/classicwow let's address the obvious first.
---
&gt; could reintroducing scrapped raids/10mans with tier gear for offspecs unlock a whole new version of wow that was originally meant to be implemented?
---
How do you measure what some folks meant to do a dozen+ years ago? What is "the spirit of classic"? Are they going to get the band back together? Who's the sooth-sayer Miyamoto-esque lord of "What is WoW?" Morhaime? Kaplan? I have no idea how you put a metric on that. 
---
- - -
---
Putting that aside,
---
I think **if** they branched out and had come Classic Plus servers (along with normal Classic servers) -- they'd do well to make ZG esque flavor raids that provide good loot, fill in gear gaps (like ZG was dope for warlocks/mages), and offer some sidegrade loot. Maybe inject something between AQ and Naxx, for example.
---
It’s funny, I’m making a hunter alt, and was just thinking to myself “I wonder if they’ll let me swap my hunter in for Domo if no other hunters need the leaf.” 
---
VC is always dead mines. 
---
Normally you raided whiteout world buffs. The game was new and you loose most buffs on death. As for consumables there where some used, healers needed mana potions and runes tank almost always used flask. For progression more consumables was used some raids used 40 flasks. But the knowledge of the game and the min maxing have continued for all these years. So there are combinations of consumables that almost none used back in the days almost mandatory today. Also something to remember is raiding difficult did not pick up until aq40 and nax and I honestly believe eaven nax is not as mechanically demanding as raids today. Big difference is that you need 40 ppl to not stand in fire not 10-25 making raiding easier for good guilds and really hard for bad guilds in alot if the fights one person can wipe the raid
---
This was one of my favorite mysteries from Vanilla -[the dalaran dome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHdDKyO1pGo). It gave me the butterfly's cause I knew the story from Wc3 and I was like "wow, I wonder what happens when it opens!" but it was sorta "meh" when it turned into a city
---
Thanks for the great answer.
---
Do you think that meta will translate over to Classic?
---
I only raided in a casual guild up to ZG, so I can't comment beyond that. In my experience, min-maxing (including specs, buffs, etc) isn't necessary. But fights weren't guaranteed wins either. In gear appropriate to the progression point, the fights were pretty well tuned to be a challenge without being impossible. It wasn't unusual for guilds to down some bosses and have to stop for the week without finishing the entire raid dungeon. Do that for a few weeks to get some gear and that allows you to carry on into the later bosses. When you're at that point, the world buffs help notably. Likewise, flasks, resistance potions, and other consumables help, too. So it can feel like they're "necessary", but that's only if you're pushing to down bosses that you're not **quite** geared for.
---
Remember that the people on private servers have been playing the same game for pretty much the last 10-15 years. Of course the bosses are easy now. For those of us that haven't played vanilla since actual vanilla, it's still going to be a bit of a challenge. The big difference for us will be that the theorycrafting over the past 10-15 years has covered the content. But that doesn't mean that everyone in the 20-40 person raid will be able to pull their weight.
---
Idk about that desktop background though....
---
For the alliance...
---
Not that they shouldn't, but some servers had the values / script wrong so that summoned minions with low health (imps is the main one I heard) were yielding XP as if a regular mob, whereas they should really be giving about 1/5th xp or something along those lines. 
---
&gt; world first will be a mage btw.
---
World first will be a hunter or a warlock, while all the private server pro mages lose their heads when their private server AoE farming spots turn out to not actually work all that well with authentic spawns.
---
Private servers are completely missing the spawn pooling mechanics. Many (if not most) AoE farming spots rely on specific kinds of mobs spawning, and on private servers the spawn will always have the same composition. In authentic vanilla (and in Classic) each spawn point chooses from a number of different mobs whenever it's time to spawn something, and on top of that I believe the spawn points aren't actually precise points like on private servers but rather areas, or a collection of points, of which not all are active at the same time.
---
Same goes for me and Tauren Tank. 
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. We disagree on its purpose. 
---
Undoubtedly its purpose is to make money. 
---
Blizzard didn’t have to do this. People were already going a damn good job at it. 
---
J Allen Bracks job is maximise return to shareholders. 
---
This. Armor values is something Blizz confirmed but look at spell damages from bosses across different pservers.. they're all different.
---
Pservers don't have the exact numbers.
---
Currently a maxed player on RS3, but looking at how the OSRS world has grown and expanded on a version of the game I love gives me great hope for classic wow

There is not a single situation in PVE where you should weave abilities and melee hits unless you have aggro. Maybe research hunter a little more?
---
Yep! We mostly used it for class discussions when someone wanted to do some theorycrafting or compare gear. We were casual, but when we raided we used more general "healers", "ranged DPS", etc channels to hand out assignments.

---
&gt; apparently had 40 in-game friends working with him around the clock to reach his god-like status. 
---
lol
---
Do you not have a right click?
---
First off being asshole who tells people "classic isn't for you" is the same smug attitude that shit like "you think you do but you don't" come from. So in that regard you can fuck off. Secondly asking someone you to buy gold which is saying "hey spend your $$$ that came from your time" asking someone to come tank is saying "hey come spend your time (which, "time is money friend") and let us get our quest and loot that you probably don't need".
---
Also I haven't been dodging that it's about a dungeon, you just don't understand a dungeon from a different perspective. First off if you've done the quest and gotten the loot or leveled a couple times dungeons yield almost nothing. They give shit xp, no money, cost money in repairs, no gear upgrades. They also take hours to complete. They are cool a few times, but down the road they are pretty much a waste of time. Which is fine for all the players who want to go slow and do dungeons dozens of times.
---
Something you are missing is that doing a dungeon isn't a magical experience for everyone. Some people don't want to do DM 12 times, and people don't want to be whispered to do dm 120 times. Now the people upvoting or commenting about how they love that this happens are the people that say yes. People that don't enjoy this or say no get negative experiences quickly. I've had people cuss me out over saying no because they've been looking for 10 whole minutes already.
---
This technique is a toxic enabler and rewards spamming players. Defending it and saying "it's cause you know im right" is the shittiest paper thin argument I've ever heard. It isn't right to spam people because you couldn't be bothered to play a tank. 
---
It could also hurt the other RP servers though. If a bunch of people who were waiting for the RP-PvP server to launch they may move over leaving servers with low pops behind. People do love a fresh server
---
The friend that got me into WoW told me to go check out the arena in STV. Then he killed me. That's when I learned about open PvP.
---
A lot of people have argued for "horizontal" content. I think they could implement this without too many mistakes, if classic turns out to be a success. Introduce a raid between AQ40-Naxx but have it not be too OP, and give some loot to Shammies, Druids, and Pallys.
---
It used to...
---
Ah spirit....first it was undertuned, then it was super overpowered, only to eventually become absolutely worthless.
---
&gt; gear for specs that are not Raid Viable
---
All specs are viable, but not everything is optimal.
---
You can bring your boomkins and rets to the raid and still clear everything, it will just take longer and require more effort from everyone else.
---
I raided in vanilla and we only did full raid buffs for sapphiron and kt. It’s not required at all but it definitely makes things much easier.
---
i feel called out but also, indeed. \m/
---
Handing off Marking to someone who isn't constantly in the thick of things isn't unheard of and isn't a bad idea if everyone is on the same page. It allows marks to change if necessary mid-fight. DPS is the best for that because a tank or healer are going to be preoccupied. 
---
I agree with where you're coming from, however some specs are unviable. Shaman tank, and Pally tank are good examples that just need a little "bump" to be viable (but not optimal, that affects the core gameplay)
---
Stormwind banners will shine Upon the Sky...!!
---
Maged vanilla.  Maging again.  Been wanting my mage back, not this “react to procs pew pew lzolz” that is the current state of the mage on live.  Been doing nothing but tanking since they destroyed my beloved mage.  Mobs better have big agro radius’s cause I’m pulling them all.  Die in a blizzard you bandits and murlocs, you dinosaurs, you f**kin thistlefur den watchers, pathfinders, and ursas.  I’m an equal opportunity icecapade.  A chilly willy.  A gold medalist at cold calculation.  
---
A man opens his door and gets shot.. And you think that of ME? No Skylar.. I AM THE ONE WHO KNOCKS !
---
Mage, i started late 06 as a druid and never hit 60 before the xpac. Had a hunter at 60 on a pserver and i still like hunters but i've never really played casters so going with something new. Portals will be super useful too, free food, ez farming potential, there are like no downsides to them. Will most likely have an alt rogue for city infiltration missions. 
---
I raided MC, ZG and AQ20 only in vanilla. We occasionally co-ordinated a heart and ony head turn in, but it was never mandatory. It was more of a ‘we’re doing this, if you want to’. We’d lose buffs about 30 mins in cos we were kinda shit too
---
My mate raided up to twin emps and didn’t use them much either. He was real surprised when we did on private servers 
---
Ye, G for guild works too
---
I am 90% sure to roll my holy priest again. Since I knew that coming in, I've been playing around with an idea for my alt. Now I'm getting excited about the shaman alt that I've decided to play, so there's a small chance that I'll end up rolling that guy first and doing the priest as an alt.
---
Spawn rate of black lotus is about 20 times better then a vanilla server and population is about 5 times vanilla servers on a high pop private server other than that I agree on everything else. All raids will be cleared easily whit in a day of release save mc that might take until week 2 from launch to clear. But this is for top guilds mid and lower guilds will probably find the content challenging 
---
Oh god so many DM's i have wiped in because of people pulling pats!
---
My imp had the best name so I got tank group every raid. 
---
It appears you accidently hung your rug on the wall to the left of the map, just a heads up.
---
Cheers and thanks for the good wishes!
---
There are a few dozen really dedicated speedrunners, and it's going to be absolutely brilliant being amongst it at launch.
---
&gt;Who the hell would buy a leveling guide when there's literally hundreds of them online for free?
---
The same people who pay for pr0n
---
...also right-click ignore? =)
---
Sharing and picking up strategies is definitely part of it and I expect down the track we will enjoy seeing others continue to develop better and better times. you're absolutely right there.
---
Especially since the Paladins don't have ranged weapons. Just Sheep, LOS and drop Consecrate around the corner. 
---
Instead of monster you need code red. 
---
Alliance for the racials, horde for the feels
---
I'm the various raid guilds I was im, we used class channels from vanilla all the way through wotlk.  Was a blast! 
---
Turdas has it nailed here in regards to mob density. Private servers have mob density absolutely maxed out with every possible spawn point spawned. Vanilla mob density looks like a barren wasteland in comparison.  
---
That's why we test on a server with mob density adjusted to vanilla density, and with mobs in their correct vanilla locations. Might not necessarily be exactly what we get on Classic, but I expect it will be a lot closer than what's on pservers atm.
---
You use to be able to duel inside IF could you do this in vanilla? 
---
If you want to do the early quests in teldrassil then that's up to you but I wouldn't personally recommend it. Walking from coldridge valley through loch modan and wetlands will take a good chunk of time and you're likely to die a few times to crocs in wetlands on the way. 
---
A good questing route for gnomes/dwarves goes through dun morogh, take the tram and do parts of elwynn, then back up to loch modan, then darkshore, then westfall.
---
If you prioritize the darkshore quests then you'll still be able to get a nice bit of darnassus rep. What you get from 1-8 or so in teldrassil is nice but won't really make a significant dent in the grind to exalted anyway. Just make sure to thoroughly do the other darnassus rep quests later on, like the feralas questlines.
---
**Go with the Horde or you get the sword.**
---
Alliance!
---
They arent all complete garbage, BUT each slot has numerous upgrades for whichever spec you are in. The priest, druid, shaman, and pally gear have zero +crit/hit/spell power/healing , and the set bonuses provide very little. Same goes for the melee stuff. Baseline stats like str/agi, while not terrible- again have numerous better pieces for each slot.
---
I'm talking about vanilla/classic wow. Are we talking about the same thing? 
---
There are a lot of issues with mob pets including agro tables and despawning
---
I don’t think moonkins were a thing or good in vanilla so I will not 
---
Whats the background on this?  From an interview?
---
Actually, I’ve thought about this and I realize that it might be for the best.
---
Think about the type of player who would reroll weeks after launch just to play on RP PVP. I have a feeling that’s the kind of player who is serious about the RP elements and probably isn’t there just to gank n00bs. I’d rather party with them
---
I don't, though I imagine a quick "classic blue post" index search would yield it really quickly. There was a post last week, and the post the week before that regarded servers. So it was about 1-2 days after the post from that week. 
---
OP is misspelling a few things and I love it.
---
Warlock helm obviously.
---
I moved from Hakkar to Malfurion in Wrath. By that time you always had to ask what DM or check the level of the inviters.
---
I'm literally going to flip a coin as I make my character to decide.
---
I,m not so sure this is eaven posible first of all alot of the meme spec have other problems then gear for example alot of the damage abilities from meme specs uses debuff slots. Second if you buff gear fro meme specs if affect pvp mostly in un known ways. Thirdly you probably need to put in a good amount of gear for non meme specs in the new raids to get ppl to do them more then one time
---
I disagree. It is the tank who knows which thing he can or can't tank, which mob is he losing, etc.
---
Could blizzard implement some of their original plans as its own xpac or patch and still stick within the "classic" goal?
---
I am here mortals.
---
Mob density is no doubt part of it, but it's not the only thing. What I was getting at is a concept known as the "spawn table". I wrote a post about it around the first Classic announcement that I keep around for explaining it: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7j1atk/dynamic_respawns_phasing/dr3anmj/?context=3
---
Basically, every spawn point is shared across a number of different possible mobs that can spawn there. When you kill a mob, there's no guarantee the same mob will respawn there. Consider, for instance, the wastelanders and pirates in Tanaris. They're a popular AoE farming spot on private servers (granted, they were popular on live too), but they're much better than they *should* be because the spawns are always the same. With a properly working spawn table/spawn pool system you might suddenly get a caster spawn in an area that was full of melee mobs the previous pull.
---
There are other issues with routing based on private server spawns. For instance I have my doubts about the Wetlands whelps spot, [which has been recommended by eg. Tips Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1aUjPZ2xvg). As you said, the mobs there could be packed too densely, but they might also be yielding too much XP. On retail there were some "weak" mobs that had an unusually low amount of HP, but also granted less XP than normal mobs would at that level. It's fairly common for private servers to not have this implemented. I think (but I'm not sure) that these whelps could be an example of this.
---
Bathroom mat* 
---
It's not about YOUR aoe, it's about the damage dealers. Of course you should use swipe to get a bit of an aggro for each mob so healthreat won't cause them to go for the healer. But apart from that you should maul a single one to maximise threat output until that one mob dies since the damage dealers should deal damage to that single target.
---
I have no problem with Blizzard expanding upon Vanilla as long as it's lore friendly. In fact, I almost expect them to add additional content sometime down the road after all the initial phases are complete. Whether it's new raids or the barber shop being added, keeping the game somewhat fresh will do well for its longevity. 
---
I’ve encountered the weird despawning for sure. And just confirmed from Joanna’s Skull Rock portion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcEqpVfrE7U&amp;list=PLMeJnlp72R7p-X7PgsMFqqjPtcxhF7kB_&amp;index=3) that the Void Walkers are giving 25% (25 xp for kill at level 11 if you spam pause/play, level 11 mob for level 11 character is exactly 100 xp).
---
Shaman and Paladin tanks need more than a little bumb with gear. For example the lack of real taunt is more than some gear can solve. Same thing goes for many other non optimal specs, they lack something on a more fundamental level (talents and skills), and no amount of gear can solve those issues.

Bamboozled.

Of course.  
---
I would add Loatheb to the mix as one where heavy consumables started to seem "balanced around". 
---
The head buffs were more akin to the way Vantus Runes are used now, something used rarely to help you get over the hump of a progression boss, not just par for the course of clearing as quickly as possible and trying to keep it as long as you can.

The only guesstimate I ever saw was that they were aiming for summer of this year.  But it's Blizzard, so not until like 2044.

Sheep pull to keep the sheep where he is.  Then everyone can aoe without cleaving the sheep.  Also the sheep and sapped mob will be in the same spot.  Any tank who lets the mage get hit on a sheep pull is not tanking right.

If you are in voice chat you can call that out and delegate the marking while you manage the situation. Thus why I said everyone being on the same page.

I raided through mc and bwl in vanilla and we never needed or required world buffs of any sort.  There weren't consumable requirements either.  It wasn't a top anything guild and we were just having fun.  I think that world buffs and all consumables will only be "required" by the top "hardcore" guilds in classic.
---
Oh, it was something recent. I misunderstood what you said, expecting they'd had some long-standing plans since the original Classic announcement! I think I found it, though: https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=29213&amp;region=eu
---
That's worrying. I was always under the impression that RP and RPPvP servers would be a nobrainer... Really hoping they have them at release.
---
What the hell are you talking about? There is no honor gear in vanilla. And there is no season 1. You are massively confused buddy.

---
^^ I think that the people like me who *haven't* played Classic *since* Vanilla (no private servers) are the only group I can therefore speak as a member of. 
---
Having said that, my attitude is that I'm much more willing to be open-minded about who does what. I always more or less was low maintenance in 5-man dungeons, but, toward the end of vanilla, I felt the min-max hardcore raiders pressuring me to decry alternate specs as less than viable, and I feel like I began parroting it. 
---
It may still end up holding true in the end, but 1.) People are likely going to be more knowledgeable all-around with the Internet having evolved new information sharing, and 2.) People who've been out of the game over a decade may find that time heals all, including their frustration with non min-max'ers, especially since so much of their "this isn't viable" attitude was reinforced by pre-1.12 patch math and wipes resulting from said math. Since we're jumping right back into 1.12's math, the memory of pre-1.12 flaws has likely faded for many.
---
Yeah maybe I shouldn't be too hasty 
---
Question related. Do you think there will be simulation tools such as SimCraft and Raidbots? I believe it would be hundreds of times easier to set up this kind of tool due to the simplicity of the skill rotations back then
---
Or you could Google it and be done 30 secs later
---
Good point. I think our raid leader handled most overlap type stuff (interrupts like you mentioned, healing assignments, etc.) over vent, probably just so everybody heard and was on the same page, but either way works.
---
This is a pretty good list. Keeping an eye on threat meters and talking to tanks will let you know how much you need to prioritise Salvation versus might/kings
---
How would blizzard monetise Addons made by other people? This would get complicated fast. 
---
Also even if it’s “pre-tested” as you put it, bugs and other issues will arise and it would be up to people outside of blizzard to fix, but blizzard would have made themselves accountable by selling the product. Then what? Blizzard has to internally test someone’s addon updates before putting them on their store? Why waste so much time and resources?
---
This whole idea sounds like a mess. 
---
Addons aren’t hard to get or install. With the updated API and launcher the twitch app will probably even be usable for classic mods - you won’t even need to do anything other than click the ones you want. 
---
ITT: u/burningdragon91 and everyone else having absolutely zero clue how to min/max and how spirit works, based on the downvote/upvote ratio
---
Then it' still the tank who is marking, just by voice and not ingame. Marking ingame takes zero effort, you can have keybinds for that. No need to overly complicate it. 
---
And you don't need freakin' voice chat for a 5man dungeon.
---
I kind of like the idea of expanding on Vanilla too - just in a whole new direction, and leave all the current path behind. Maybe have a world event to destroy the portal, preventing TBC, but preserve Karazhan, Archimonde/Mt. Hyjal - stuff like that.  
---
Eventually add Northrend, but for the love of God, never add pandas.

I was part of a clique that eventually left my first raiding guild but that was born more out of player skill and who was on the most vs. specific chat channels, though I can definitely see the potential for drama. I listen to Preach's drama time while I work and it's definitely a root cause!
---
I ran progression in Vanilla as a protection warrior. I fcked up so much I was almost a joked, except I showed up, and I worked. You're going to make mistakes. Everyone will. Just don't make the same over and over again. Be cautious, keep agro, and let the hunters fck up more.
---
Not sure if that's true. Tips Out did a good video series on class DPS/HPS rankings in the different vanilla raids.
---
MC:
---
https://youtu.be/u0wciSPO9zg
---
Average for top mages: 360 DPS
---
Average for top warlocks: 260 DPS
---
Naxx:
---
https://youtu.be/EBSnGwxmOSU
---
Average for top mages: 1000 DPS
---
Average for top warlocks: 750 DPS
---
This is of course based on how much you trust private server scripting and numbers. Personally I'm willing to bet though that private server numbers are within 10% or so accuracy at compared to retail vanilla.
---
It also depends on the fight - especially the duration of the fight. Mage DPS on longer fights, especially as fire, will really start to drop off as they run out of mana. Whereas in short, 1 minute or so fights Mage DPS will be amazing because cooldowns like Arcane Power / Combustion or trinkets like mind quickening gem will have a massive impact. Warlocks don't have such impactful burst cooldowns - but will shine in longer fights where their mana efficiency via life tap allows them to keep going for longer than mages can. 
---
Warlocks also have amazing utility via curses, healthstones, summons, soulstones etc. This can't be ignored for raiding - it's not all about DPS.
---
The numbers in Tips' video are skewed towards mages because the parses are likely from top guilds who kill bosses very quickly since everyone in the raid is doing high DPS. This results in lots of short fights which benefits mages as we said.
---
Question: was your main a tank?
---
I just picked one up off ebay for $15, makes for some great night time reading
---
Dude, I'm not saying you HAVE to say yes lol. Just tell them no. why are you going into the length of a dungeon and that you already did it. I never once said in any post that you were obligated to say yes. Please, try to understand that this the best way to form parties in Classic WoW and any other classic MMORPG. Calm down man!
---
I don’t know about the whelps but I agree about the shared spawn point. We implemented that early last year and it made quite the difference. 
---
zf is the only dungeon where volunteers are so plentiful they are literally falling out of the sky (assuming their engineering device malfunctions).
---
I'm planning to play a warrior this time around in Classic so I guess I'll be participating in tank chat this time around. Awwww yeah.
---
Pro tip for anyone who needs a tank for scolo. Ask druids, druid tanks are more common place now and a lot of their gear is in there. 
---
First off, I was on a phone so auto correct got me. Damn.
---
What made her rightful of criticism? Just generally being a know-it-all-because-I-said-so type is my only guess from the sound of it?
---
I’ve mained a warlock since OG classic, my greatest raiding feat was probably getting “The Undying” title in WotLK.
---
I’m going to start with horde and likely aim for a RP-PvP (it not just regular PvP) server. I’m looking for a group that likes to spend time doing whatever they want. Whether it’s pvp, raiding, memes in Barrens chat, or anything else. I’ve settled down a LOT from when I first picked up WoW and just want it to feel like an adventure again.
---
Premade BGs will likely be my main attraction (if you can even make premades in classic, I don’t remember).
---
Feel free to reach out and we can connect on the battle.net app until classic arrives! (I’ve been enjoying a lot of HotS lately)
---
boomers btw
---
I am very calm lol. Secondly the problem isn't being asked to do a dungeon. Also this isnt the best way to form parties... The best way is to join a guild and do stuff with friends or other guildies...
---
Yeah, but this is 1.12, so it won't be as hard as we remember, either.
---
Wut..
---
Cheers I was pretty sure it was reduced xp. Great to confirm
---
If you read carefully, you would see I said that getting invited to groups to tank is a core part of the class. You're hyped up about all this, which is why I said maybe classic isn't for you. I didn't say it to be mean but it genuinely doesn't seem like it's the game for you if being invited to tank a dungeon pisses you off so damn much. It's literally the way the game works. You're going to be very upset most of the time because people will be asking you to tank. Again, not trying to be mean or demeaning or anything. I'm assuming you're coming to retail and I was just trying to get you some insight. No offense intended by saying that maybe the game isn't for you.
---
Yeah I get the mechanic. But Tell me which class needs spirit the most outside of healers. Cause my thought process is... No mana? That’s your fault for wasting mana on expensive skills and not using lower ranks if content is too long for you. If your best case for needing spirit over another stat is in 2-3 mins I’ll need it then it isn’t as efficient as other stats. Where you use 24/7
---
Alliance, we got gnomes
---
If by code red you mean coffee then I agree
---
Maybe they should make it so that if you diminish the difficulty to get past something, you can't raise it back up until the end of the playthrough.
---
Dope. Commenting for later reference
---
Where did you get the map? :)
---
- LEDs
---
- 16:9 Flat Panel Monitors
---
You get points for coolness but a heavy penalty for lack of authenticity. Where are the 4:3 CRT monitors and beige equipment at?
---
in 2005, the top guilds would stack mages. 
---
Anyway, this is all irrelevant, classic will be a new game and we don't know yet classes' DPS ranking.
---
I could see the gold farming meta changing a lot.
---
Anything that relies on specific pathing and drop rates could be subject to major changes.
---
BUR to you too
---
I would say that leveling with a priest benefits a rogue a lot more than a mage.
---
Mages tend to take no/very little damage while leveling since they are kiting with frost spells. So a priest's healing ability is wasted on them, since mana rather than health is the bottleneck for speed.
---
On the other hand, for rogues health is the bottleneck. A rogue supported by priest heals has very little downtime since they can just go efficiently from mob to mob without needing to bandage/eat as they normally would.
---
Also consider that mages and priests are both cloth wearers - so when good cloth gear drops, you'll have to split it between you. Cloth/leather avoids that problem.
---
&gt; We implemented that early last year and it made quite the difference.
---
Just out of curiosity, how robust is your implementation? A big reason servers don't have any spawn table systems is that the existing databases are fundamentally just not designed that way. The assumption behind all the existing spawn data was that each spawnpoint is a static entity completely separate from all other spawnpoints in the area and only ever spawns one type of mod. Implementing a spawn table system (properly, at least) would thus require re-doing pretty much all the spawn data.
---
If you've done that for what seems to be a private testing server, colour me impressed! And even if you haven't, I'm still impressed.
---
This sub is mostly pretty relaxed. I’d say 90% of us just like to shoot the shit about a cool game and voice our opinions from time to time. I’m glad this sub continues to be loud about things they think are potential problems, like sharding and the current report system. 
---
The other 10% will do what they do, and honestly, I rarely see the angry trollish insults at the top of the thread.
---
&gt; 1) its prohibitively expensive  
---
It's not. Only hunters have any real use for it and they can easily farm enough gold for it in a few hours by doing solo mara runs.
---
&gt; 2) there are greens for sale at that level nearly as good 
---
Show one

Undercity is where it's at.

Why is this downvoted. This is a realistic opinion.
---
Wife and I are doing #1. She will be warrior. 
---
I play over 60 hours a week on vanilla pservers, sometimes more. I have played since retail vanilla, and played hundreds of days played on warriors in pservers. I know what vanilla is and am not "coming from retail". But sure, if someone disagrees with you claiming they came from retail is a pretty good way to try and invalidate someone. Also you implied that inviting, but I took it as the implication was saying tanking was a core part of the class. So maybe I misinterpreted the implied meaning of what you were saying. Sure.  
---
I don't get pissed off at the game all the time, I don't get very upset, I don't get hyped over this shit. I find it mildly annoying. A mild annoyance =/= me raging at my computer screen or getting angry or anything else people think the word annoy means but its pretty funny how upset people get that I claim it annoying. And getting spammed is fine w/e people think that spamming warriors is socially acceptable, which I guess it is based on the mass dps upvote on this post.  
---
But trying to invalidate someones else's view that getting dozens of whispers an hour is spam (which it very evidently is) and claim that they are in the wrong for having that view is just silly. Its a perspective, my perspective is its annoying to get spammed by randos all day long. Your perspective is spamming warriors is A-O-K cause they picked warrior and they knew what they were getting into. Its just perspective, that doesn't mean I have to agree with you or you have to agree with me.
---
a nice cold retbull would be preferable 
---
Unfortunately, I could not confirm if the Hyenas in Desolace that spawn in packs of 5 with reduced health should yield full xp or reduced. He didn’t hit them once in his video. :/
---
Might go Horde this time but I alwayed rolled Alliance for a few reasons.
---
Pros:
---
-Better city layout. While it’s not as cool, the Horde cities are a pain to navigate. 
---
-IMO better starter and mid level zones (except ganking. So much ganking.) Always found leveling certain Horde levels to be a chore.
---
-Always more people on Horde, which makes queues for BG much faster as Alliance. 
---
-Solid racial abilities 
---
-Naked dancing NELFS
---
-Play as a gnome, bunny hop a lot, everyone on Horde will despise you. 
---
-Less people, usually weaker than the Horde, gives a nice challenge. 
---
-Stockades are easy to spam and for cloth it is sort of useful
---
Cons: 
---
-Constant ganking
---
-Not as cool
---
-Horde gets a flightpath in North STV. RIP.
---
-Long ass run to SFK and SM. Shadowfang is one of my favorite dungeons and not easy to play as Alliance. 
---
yikes
---
Doesnt twitch have a mod manager? 
---
Do you care if I 2h Tank it? I farmed \[Sul'Thraze the Lasher\]
---
Its part of the same problem, that private servers have certain game mechanics wrong, such as having wands be considered range mechanics in the same breadth that bows/guns/xbows are and mistakenly benefit from agility.
---
Its a problem with MangOs core based private servers.
---

---
Eventually. This has to happen. MC, Ony, ZG, all these raids are going to topple over due to player skill and awareness. The fights in retail are so much more complex than the ones in classic. 
---
Naxx and AQ are going to be the only two extremely difficult raids. 
---
That said. In 2-3 years, it's either progress to BC, or add to the classic story. Classic can't live forever. 
---
That and the assassin's blade. 
---
I think you might be talking about 2.0
---
Who is your daddy and what does he do?
---
One of my favorite parts of playing a Prot Warrior is the camaraderie. You share everything, bitch about everyone else, you’re almost always both officers, and farm each other gear/consumes. It’s a really sweet and wholesome WoW relationship. 
---
I thought the horde had some fore-knowledge of the allied response? And wasn't there an arranged meeting there again later?
---
PvP for sure. It’s what I started on, and definitely how I’ll be playing through classic. Nothing beats seeing a yellow name on your screen that can be attacked or attack you. World PvP was a blast 
---

---
Yeah, we killed everything except 4H, Sapph, and KT in my guild - and the only fight we did full buffs for was Loatheb. Head turn ins made things quicker, but were never required. From what I recall, it just didn't save any meaningful amount of time - so it just wasnt worth the extra effort.
---
No idea what will be the new expectations though.
---
Sounds good to me

Not true; these are the doctored screenshots blizzard put out all the time on their websites where they would pose their characters. They used to post updates with these kinds of screenshots just about every week with a bunch of silly stuff involved.

---
https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof
---
If it's so easy to "just google it", surely you can provide a link to this alleged proof?
---
I stream paint drying if you are interested. 
---
Some things like BIS lists could definitely change.  Depending on proc rates, things like ironfoe or trash blade change from being pretty good to being stupidly amazing.
---
Huh that's pretty awesome. I honestly rarely played with game music on because of always being on teamspeak or just playing my own music.
---
I still remember both of my first raiding guild's main MT/OT. Really awesome dudes. I remember one night we killed Rag and he dropped the warrior T2 pants. Our OT won the role and was about to receive it when he said over vent "Wait give it to the MT instead it's better for him right now". Can't remember why exactly. Think the MT had the helm already and would get the set bonus where the OT didn't have the helm off Ony yet. Was a really cool thing to see so I know what you're talking about.
---
&gt; The overpowered gold generating farm spots like maruadon and diremaul AOE farm causes inflation.
---
I’d say the server’s DMs selling gold is worse for the economy. 
---
Just for the record, world buffs aren’t for progression raiding. You’re not going to buff up before your first time in MC or your first attempt at Ony. You’ll die and lose all your buffs. World buffs are for farm night, and they’re intended to speed things up. 
---
Maga 
---
I have two cans of the og wow mt Dew unopened 
---
Ah didn’t notice this was classic wow subreddit. No wonder 😂 my bad. 
---
Oh snap, I had no idea.
---
I remember raiding as a mage in vanilla, but I didn't raid further than BWL in a casual guild.  I've also played on a vanilla private server.  
---
The biggest difference between the two that I can think of is how safe we used to play it, and take as much time as possible just to be sure of the kill.  We never used world buffs, nor did we have consumable requirements, but we also took an incredibly long time to clear through raids.  It was probably the biggest limiting factor to our progression.  Contrast that to my private server guild that used world buffs, not to make the progression fights easier, but to clear the farm bosses more quickly and maybe get 1 good attempt at a new boss.
---
I would say that you don't have to worry about world buffs ruining your experience.  Even if guilds try to take advantage of them, it's not like you'll leave the raid to drop a head buff for every attempt.  In my private server experience, the real progression usually comes without the buffs.  In my vanilla experience, the buffs are absolutely not necessary to raiding.  Just incredibly helpful, if a bit tedious.
---
I had a nearly full lightforge set for my warrior when he needed to learn a new weapon skill
---
Of course, by the time I got all that gear, I had most weapons trained
---
This is my experience on private server. Our first night in MC the only boss we downed first try was Magmadar, and we only had like 15 survivors. 
---
Rebalance all the specs because class fantasy gets us going, continue building the world with the vibe, add quests that reward with satisfaction rather than xp. Make it the fantasy game of dreams instead of the mmos of mmos
---
The dwarves in southern barrens, I’ve never seen competition for mobs from other players there. I guess it gets skipped a lot for ashenvale or hillsbrad. 
---
How does it help if you just did on your first attempt?
---
idk why y'all went off on this tangent. It was pretty obvious that I was talking about going oom healing in raids.
---
&gt;I still have this picture lying around in the box. I will say - I never looked at it closely, but consider this shit for a moment: what we're seeing is a level 60 warrior with no helm, cape, second trinket or bow, and with no stances learned and his auto-attack ability still bound at max level, who seems to have nevertheless completed   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You Are Rakh'likh, Demon  
---
&gt; for the 16 slot bag, aggro a supposedly weak mob in the Dwarf Starting Zone while a Warlock who he isn't in a party with runs up to him and casts Demon Armor.
---
ah that daily occurrence in vanilla kept me playing
---
Can opinions be factually incorrect?
---
May I ask what evidence you base this on? Since this is clearly taken from in game back in beta.
---
If its about the name of the tauren, the naming limits used to be much more relaxed in beta.
---
To take it a step futher to disapprove your post, I've decided to upload an image from beta 0.8 client.
---
It used to work a bit different compared to the 7.2 head tracking, instead of targeting it was based on mouse hovering.

Here's Ion's most recent tweet about it:
---
&gt; To be clear, we have no philosophical opposition to setting up a Classic RP-PvP server. But our priority is making sure servers have long-term healthy populations, so we'll start with lean realmlists and expand as needed, just as the 2004 launch did.

It amazes me how many people take Pservers as the gospel, they truly have no idea how inaccurate things are. Watch fury warriors cry because Ironfoe has a 2% proc rate instead of 15%, or HoJ. I cannot wait for True Vanilla and not some Private server bullshit. 
---
Ohh man, yeah I spent some time doing that myself. Lots of goodies in that one!

Yes.

---
&gt; As I had forgotten more than I ever knew about Engineering
---
I...  don't think that's possible.
---
On my last private server, we had 2 other tanks and when we were gearing up, one of our tailors got a pattern for Shifting Cloak (the one with +defense and armor). When I went out to farm one, I farmed up the mats for 2 more so we’d all have the defense from it. Two days later, our Main Tank gave me Stockade Pauldrons. Those were good guys, and we’d always share potions and other stuff. It’s not nearly as competitive as other classes, we just want to help each other out, because strong Tanks make a strong guild. 
---
No it won't 
---
The flags are next to the wrong continents! 
---
I haven’t done it myself. I play test on a server designed by someone who is working to produce a next gen vanilla core. He’s the one who has worked for years correcting spawns and tables. He just implemented mob AI which he did for every single mob type. 
---
You can check it out, he always welcomes anyone who can report any bugs or theorycraft. Look for Fuzedknight on discord. 
---
Not sure where you're getting your numbers, but levelling engineering can cost hundreds of gold, doing it for less than 100 would be extremely rare and unlikely depending on your server. Even in Classic retail leveling a new profession by purchasing the mats would cost you a few hundred gold.
---
Don't know if I'm buying it but as an Outkast fan I love it

Lot of ppl saying desolace, it's funny how people can like different things. I don't hate des, but it's probably in my bottom 5 for zones. I also just love stranglethorn vietnam. Everything about it, just crazy fun and kinda ultra annoying

Watching them die.   Truth.
---
The two are intertwined.  If you know your hardware limits your player cap to 2500 all your other design decisions will be informed by that.  100 features later and now even if you could change that 2500 all the other stuff wouldn't work well with it.

Thats exactly what I was thinking. I would love for some asshole guild to come raid my memorial.

Oh yeah it's nice having competent players man i have a mage buddy that i run strat lives with he loves when i tank lol

You must have painted over the shadow you burned into the wall.

I couldn't agree more with this, hunters have to be the blame.

I myself am a fan of the Warrior trinket that gives you 30 rage. You can use it out of combat then swap back to whatever. 
---
Depending on how they plan on doing gear, if it is scaled back to the original stats it will be more difficult.

lol yikes

you didn't need the z-/c-/-z simply typing /who redridge 60 would list all 60's in redridge for your faction

I'm playing with a friend right now to get back into the feel of things on *ahem* 's new server and he does this so much. I just stop chasing mobs if they're going for him. i figure he'll learn eventually.
---
i feel so attacked

I’m currently pretty sure I want to play warlock, but I’m also considering playing a hunter. If my main focus is raids and pug bgs/world pvp, is one better than the other? From what I understand, guilds take around 4 of each for raids. Both classes are good at the pvp aspects I’m interested in.
---
Are there any pros or cons I’m missing? Does one stand out in front of the other at certain progression points?

Here's a fucking comment from 2008 saying they do not scale with anything.
---
here is a wiki with stuff from vanilla era, not private servers

took me literally 2 seconds.
---
The reason wand dps is so absurdly high compared to any other weapon in the game is because they are static damage. What you see is what you get outside the mage and priest damage. Although you CAN "scale" their specific damage type with debuffs like curse of shadow and curse of elements.
---
Reel trinket is dope, too. Makes taunt resist a thing of the past.

I’ll give you a semi long story. 
---
My wife met me pretty much with no family. I didn’t have much but a room.... a sun room with no insolation and obviously covered in Windows (This is a big deal because she had mastcell which is a blood disorder where you get hives from any changes of heat and cold. I mean she gets hives from being to happy or sad as well.). (we live in MA so obviously it’s cold and that’s a shitty situation to live in) She helped me get on my feet and I worked my ass off to impress her. Her family is well off and her mother has been in the essential oils / herbs business for like 25? Years I think? Anyways. As years go by and I work my way up the kitchen staff ladder until I am where I wanted to be (function supervisor and cook) (ages 19-21) with my cooking experience and my mother in laws experience we collabed and I signed a bunch of papers because my mother in laws credit was not good. 
---
I’m a bad story teller but the short answer is. I have it because of my wife. She got me off drugs, she pushed me to be the man she and I knew I could be and got me away from the “street life”. Her mother in law helped me a ton in understanding business and now here we are. Building a business together as a family. 
---
Bonus info: my wife is now 6 months pregnant with our first child! (It’s a girl) YEET!
---
Also thank you for asking. It really helped me with some stress being able to talk about my life. 
---
I like both. Husband wants us to go Alliance, so I guess we'll easymode it and let the paladins in dresses do all the healing.

There was a gold farmer, a female night elf rogue named Lovekiss, on my server, Shattered Hand.  This person would just farm the Orcs in the burning steppes for like an entire day straight.  Eventually, he bought himself a Krol Blade off the auction house.  Never talked.  No emotes, never a reply.  Just farming those Orcs in the circular buildings, over and over.
---
He ended up selling the character I think because months later, Lovekiss appeared in a raiding guild and suddenly spoke perfect English.  Guy ended up getting full Bloodfang.
---
Luckily it doesn’t take much to run wow anymore. You can do it on a nice budget 
---
is it playable? like to level and quest through some of it?

The original vanilla lead developer was asked on the Classic podcast if it was design or if it was hardware limitations and he said it was 100% design.

nice, lots of things seemed to work out pretty nicely there. congrats on the new human!

One quest I love is the Turtle Bisque Cooking quest in Hillsbrad. Sometimes I will just kill every turtoise up that entire river. Good meat, clam meat, pearls, scales that vendor, skins, and the occassional blue.
---
Also starting at half a mana bar just starts a perpetual game of catch-up. You bet your god damn ass I'm finishing those drinks I had to buy because we didn't get a mage, so then I have to bust out my biggest heals to get you to full before you die and then I'll be oom again.

That's actually pretty cool.

As a gnome I need dis.

Frost mage does need to respec for PvP and PvE. If you are the one winters chill mage you skip all of the good pvp talents like shatter. All other mages go arcane all the way up to arcane power and then only 20 pts in frost
---
Yeah I’m planning for 800-900 for the machine and some extra on monitor keyboard and maybe a desk and chair. 
---
I was a Priest from Vanilla to Cata. I need to be needed. I make a load of friends while leveling, tell people to call me if they're in need and logged in regularly to 3/4 whispers of greetings and requests for aid.
---
I was also the guild Enchanter, to be fed recipes and green drops by friends was something I would deeply love to have again.
---
If by some event I do not, my backup is to go Horde and be a shaman, support allies with those sweet totems.
---
They gave warlocks a demonic tanking form in Panderia, and it had to be removed from the game when they decided to create demon hunters
---
I always did that back then, but I ended up messaging the same people again and then they got angry. :x
---
I mean, the math checks out, but it's impossible for any character to have only 10 intellect.  Level 1 characters start with more.

Who’s that?

Man I hope by “summer” they mean that I will have a solid month to play it all day all night before school starts again. Sick setup btw.

I hope so. Where I'm from it means "cat", which would be a really weird thing to have his lips around...

Yes, people RPd.  It ranged from people who were always in character to people who just wanted the more laid back server attitude and never rpd.  I am hoping they start one at launch.

I originally rolled horde but server population was skewed so I rolled alliance later on. Lots more groups
---
Maybe I don't get the joke of including FF on this meme.  
---
He's brutally good, Alliance or Horde.  
---
well thought out. i'm speaking from consistent, end-game experience on private servers as a lock, so potentially unreliable - but i know that human error and RNG taken into account, on many end-game bosses it was a race between locks, mages, warriors and rogues for the top spot. fights like c'thun were locks' bread and butter. deathcoil and dots on tentacles, dots on stomach tentacles, and pewpew on the boss, plus as you mentioned it was a longer fight. i remember many occasions of a lock topping meters by a small margin, often with fury warriors in hot pursuit.
---
I mean if you're good with just whacking things leveling....go warrior or paladin. Warrior's at 60 are goddamn monsters and paladins are unkillable. 
---
Fuck that noise! I am not going to pay $30 each character to transfer over once they eventually add RP-PvP. I'm sure as hell not "re-rolling" either because I have a job and a life and don't have enough time on my hands.
---
I'm also in the OSRS/alternate timeline group. I want to see the game go through the rumored expansions, like Emerald Dream or South Seas. Basically just take all the confirmed lore from the Warcraft games and vanilla and change things up. We'd maybe still end up doing Outland, but it'd be a combination of it and Legion and we kill Sargaeras rather than drag that out forever.
---
Only +1 edge.

I got the flags before I even considered a map.  I'll give them a swap this evening! Thanks! 
---
There is all kinds of autism (in this case it is the good kind) in this thread. 
---
were you able to test this on the demo? On some private servers i played it was simply a static 5 minute respawn timer for most mobs. I tested this out and got between 5 to 7 minute respawns with some mobs spawning almost exactly at the 5 minute mark. Would you have any ideas on what the minimum timer would be if someone was ahead of the pack in leveling on launch and had basically an open zone to kill mobs in? 
---
I got the flags put up before I even considered a map. I'll get that fixed asap. Thanks for the good eyes!

Nah mate.

4 hunters is a bit of a stretch, usually 2-3 as far as i know. hunters have higher skill cap for pvp i believe, and fuck up warlocks. for pure pve dps a warlock will almost always outstrip a similarly geared hunter, but hunters are still needed.

awesome setup

Agreed. Looking for replacements and figuring out how to set separate wallpapers per monitor 
---
I eagerly await the return of the Stair boss.  Theres like a parabola of tank skill for tanking on stairs, and 99% do it wrong, but the middle ground tanks know enough to avoid them.
---
None of this is true.
---
oh god what r u doing, why would u do this
---
It depends on what you're doing. In a raid, your class leader will typically assign you a buff to do, so you wont even need to think about it.
---
If you're in a 5m dungeon and don't know what buff to give someone just ask them what they want, then it's their fault if it's wrong. Ha!
---
As a warlock Salv was always my highest priority. Then Wis and then light. Kings didn't do nearly as much for me as it did for other classes, but every little bit helps I guess...
---
The black lotus spawn rate was specifically altered because raiders on private server use black lotus way way way more than people did in classic yes.
---
The cans are in the bottom left if you look closely 
---
been testing out dungeon AoE leveling with a couple of friends on private servers and the XP is insane and far greater than anything you can get solo.
---
it's a slow start but once you get to level 30 it becomes very efficient and super fast, especially in heavy mob dungeons like SM, ZF (hello graves), ST, BRD. it's pretty much smooth sailing to 60. you gather some mobs and hide so they all come to melee range and tank picks them up then blow them up.
---
for those interested, the group consisted of 2x hellfire warlocks, a fire mage, disc priest and a prot warrior.
---
in original vanilla mob tagging in dungeons worked differently as i remember leveling many alts that way and it only took like 6 or so hours to get to 60.
---
you'd basically body pull entire dungeon with a 60 character (pref. mage) and then leave group and tag them with your alt then proceed to kill them out of group with 60 and the alt would get full xp since you didn't get kicked immediately and had 1 minute. zone out, disband for reset and repeat. the only downside was the 5? dungeons per hour limit which usually you'd have to wait around 10-15 minutes every hour.
---
so if the above mob tagging works on official vanilla servers then AoE leveling as a group to quickly level a mage to then boost mains would make the most sense.
---
unless you want to enjoy leveling again, in which case level the normal way and ignore addons.

Wouldn’t listen to the guy saying you’re set for a casual guild. If you have progress / min max mentality and put 15hr a week into wow, you’ll be raiding just fine. Not super hardcore, but certainly not casual. I’m stunned by the responses of people who consider 15-20hrs a week to be casual. 
---
In a 5 man sure.  In a raid, nope.  
---
Vanilla has crushing blows and parry haste.  It was possible to get 3x crushed in under 3s.  There are like 3 spells that can save you from this, and chances are they will fuck up the threat since the tank just got parried 3 times.
---
Clearly a shaman tanking item
---
They removed that sometime during vanilla, probably won't work when classic comes out unfortunately
---
I remember some of those paid leveling guides back in the day - I ended up finding a torrent for one of them and used that with pretty good success and zero negatives such as viruses or some dumb shit. 
---
It still boggles my mind that people tried to sell the guides back in the day, that people bought said guides back in the day, AND that it's still being tried today lol. Holy Toledo!
---
I'm definitely for sure going to play an Orc Shaman, but I also want to skill up 2 professions while leveling. I'm not racing to 60, and even if it's more tedious I like the idea of having that extra aspect on my character, and the idea of using items I've created for myself while leveling. I'm leaning heavily between Skinning and Leatherworking or Herbalism and Alchemy, but still haven't decided either way. I'd also like to try enchanting but can't think of another profession to pair with it. I've even considered mining and blacksmithing, just to create some massive two-handers for myself.
---
Does anyone have any advice that could help me?
---
I am playing a tank now, yes.
---
(background: #13 world KT vanilla) You don't need world buffs for anything, except for maybe the first kill push on one of the more difficult bosses, if you feel like that's the extra nudge you require (such as DPS-checks). Other than that, the consumables are very situational for certain bossfights, such as greater shadow protection potions for loatheb and frost pots for sapphiron. Flasks of titan were required for everyone for progression raids. For me it took easily 2-4 hours a day just to farm such consumables. When it comes to world buff, i guess they're a lot more p-server kinda thing for speedrunning the earlier raids for new record times.
---
All that being said, we actually accidentally got our first sapphiron kill on a "warmup run" without flasks, as everyone just somehow happened to perform perfectly all at the same time, lol.
---
That’s the one I’m talking about, the horde was basically code red lol

You guys know the only reason Classic is happening is because it's cheap, and it's cheap because they don't have to develop new content, right?

Unless it's *really* successful, it's not happening
---
Serious about RP elements? Sorry if I sound bitter here, but I've seen far too much RP elitism on this topic both here and on the official forums. My RP-PvP realm back in vanilla had a good balance of players, and I think expecting it to be 'pure' may get in the way of just having a decently populated realm. 
---
I definitely don't think it'll be for the best, and will reluctantly roll on a PvP server if they aren't there on launch; I'm not waiting 2 weeks to \_ months just to play the game. 
---
I recommend a glass jar of water too. Have some reservoir jugs nearby, and you'll be hydrated all day without having to get up
---
Authoritarian and over-assertive, despite not being one of the people in charge. Some very good people who were further up the ladder left because of her, so she made space for herself that way. Also, she liked to use her position and gender to manipulate various guild members.  I spent way too much time online back then farming mats and helping others get raid-ready, which became increasingly necessary thanks to the revolving door she created before the guild eventually folded. A lot of good people benefitted from my efforts, only to leave because of her. I didn't realize she was the reason at the time, because she was always nice to me.
---
At one point she even tried to lure me to a meet-up in Vegas with a more prominent guild on our server, and made various promises to sweeten the offer if I'd come. She had been trying for months to join them and wanted to take myself and a few others with her.
---
I'd been through the worst break-up of my life not long before, so I declined to meet.  After she departed for the meet up, she never logged in again. After a few weeks passed, I got a mutual friend from the guild to spill the beans about what had happened to her. He was friends with members of the other guild, having healed for them a couple of times when they had need (in actuality he was trying out to join them and not being completely forthcoming about it). He told me she'd planned to try to get the three of us and a few other geared members in as a package deal, and my going was to serve as a sort of interview. I didn't know what to say. I was part flattered, and part furious. Anyway, apparently she went to the meet-up, got shitfaced, made a lot of people really uncomfortable, slept with one of the guild's raid leaders, and he'd contracted some form of hepatitis as a result. Needless to say she wasn't invited to join them afterword. I tried to contact them to inform them I had no idea about what she was up to.  No one from their guild would speak to me.
---
When I say I became a ronin on that server, I mean it in the truest sense. I tried for a couple of months to find a new guild.  The couple I joined never clicked. All of my old guild mates I was close to either changed servers or quit playing altogether. Even the couple I'd leveled up with since grouping with them in RFK believed I wasn't worth associating with anymore, assuming I was bound to her somehow.  That's when I started rolling alts and trying to start over. 
---
Anyway, sorry for the drawn-out explanation. 
---
tl;dr: Bitch was genuinely cray-cray. 
---
I was 12 years old and cleared MC, Ony, BWL, ZG lmao. It's not mandatory at all to have buffs or even be good/optimal. I remember having wizard oils and Mana pots, but that's all.
---
My alt was called Nundead
---
&gt;The really frustrating thing about being in this position of being viewed as such a niche community is Blizzard never really gave it a chance to be anything else.
---
Hey, those wanting to play vanilla were a 'niche' community as well at some point....  
---
Not an argument on its own, but a noteworthy point to make imo.

Warrior?

Sounds like a casual mindset to me. /s

For real, the last 3 expansion launches went pretty smooth. You had to deal with lag and bugs but you could level just fine, no real downtime.

---
not sure how many others there are that sahre my view, but i honestly think that vanilla can last forever in it's own right. i'm all for adding tbc option and giving vanilla the osrs treatment, but that needs to be a dedicated separate server type; there must always be a pure vanilla server for us to play. if there is no og vanilla available, we'll just end up back at this point again down the line.

It would depend when I saw them. If they were one of the first, then yes, not so much "no life" but pity and a lack of respect since they virtually have to break the terms of agreement to achieve it so soon (sharing your account as an example). Later though, when those people are gone, and it's a little tamer to achieve, absolutely an amazing feat!

The Alliance|Horde post made me remember this ditty.

To be fair.. I am Alliance . . but love oxhorn

no money, no time, keep your head up pal, things will get better 
---
This is the way to go. Names that work well together and aren't just reverse variations. Otherwise, you might be accused of multi-boxing. 
---
Also, depending on your guild name, you can make it a part of that. 
---
Look at BiS list. Look at consumables needed for MC. Farm the materials for those.
---
I have a dozen spots to farm, based on the economy. I have around 50 items I want to buy with the intent of selling months later.

They've left worldport enabled a few times on ptr. One was in bc, one wrath and one as recent as Legion

Rolling Horde because the crew wants to, but when I played in vanilla I started on Alliance, because I was 12 of course. So I secretly wish we were playing Alliance for that nostalgia. And so I could roll Pally

Alchemy and herbalism are much better choices than skinning and leather working. I played a hunter in Vanilla with skinning and leather working. You need too many different types of mats for leatherworking.. it just plain sucks.

honestly it has nothing to do with envy. But congrats

Well yeah, but no One wants to be reminded of that 😢

Hi. I raided as a restoration druid to c'thun prior to naxx being released. Um, we most certainly did use world bluffs, it was more or less just the guild getting the org bluffs and then individual players who took it upon themselves to get the other buffs prior to that.
---
I distinctly remember zg buff being good for somethings but cant remember why lol
---
I use W A S D where W and S are forward / backpedal and A and D are strafe and turn with the mouse. I like the S for backpedaling still because it helps with re-positioning a mob while tanking. Or if youre fighting like 5 mobs all fanned out in front of you from front left of your character to front right and theres a patrol coming.. in that case backpedal really is the best option since you wont give the mobs a chance to attack your back. However, if backpedal isnt fast enough to get out of patrol range in time then its just simply better to strafe out of there and let some of the mobs hit your back for a couple attacks. Its situational on whats better to move around but if I were a different class like a hunter or mage or something I dont think Id have backpedal keybinded
---
For me I hold 'w' to go forward, hold the right mouse button to steer and then 'q' and 'e' to strafe left and right, 'a' 's' 'd' are unbound from movement and used for spells instead, so i can't keyboard turn or back pedal but thats not a bad thing, been playing this way for over a decade so would be hard to change now.
---
Hey, thanks! I love frost. Apparently I already watched this, I must have been super baked or something, lmao.
---
Thank you!
---
No changes , also wow lore is confusing enough without blizzard adding a 2nd time line with new classic content.
---
Just do tbc after classic.
---
We set the standard for ambiguous duos. 
---
April 11th they will announce the release date
---
Listen, addons are scary at first. We were all there at one point. You worry you will completely break your game or, at the very least, be forced to reinstall. I can tell you, wow was the first game I ever used addons with and it really, really is one of the easiest things to do. And I'm sure you might be thinking, "this guy is only saying that because he's got years of experience modding and of course it's easy for him!" And it's true I do have years of modding experience (using mods in many games, not making mods). But it is virtually impossible to break this game modding it using safe addons. And, once the game is close to release, expect dozens, or even hundreds of guides on the internet explaining this in detail. 
---
As for letting blizzard become a third party for community addons, please look up the history of how Bethesda handled it with Skyrim: https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/28/5-reasons-why-valves-paid-mod-workshop-failed
---
Blizzard has always maintained a decidedly handoffs approach to mods unless it's either so good they attain it from the creator and add it directly to the game or so game breaking they actively patch it out. 
---
In vanilla wow I had a dual box POM Pyro mage duo

Thank you! I'm thinking option 2 is the way to go, as I'm planning on starting skinning/mining for the BRD farm. Probably make my way back to the lower level zones to grind out some mats to offset the cost a bit once I've acquired my mount. 
---
Not to be ungrateful or whatever but at this point I'm disappointed when the blue posts aren't a release date. The last few have been good so it seems like they're on the right track.. I have faith they won't fuck it up at this point so plzzz just gimme that date so I can plan my summer
---
Horde!!!
---
I messed around a little bit on a private server to try out Alliance and realized firsthand how boring and plain it is (and painful being on the receiving end in Redridge). Moreover, I’m big into WPvP and I’m definitely going to contribute my part once again in ruining many Alliance players’ days (not hours; days). Definitely rather play the grizzled and hungry underdog than the prim and purse-toted poodle.
---
&gt;that I didn't have to drag into any game folder. I don't even know how to do this with battle.net
---
you drag the addon... into the addon folder. I teach computer skills to octogenarians in nursing homes once a month so they can "do the facebooks with their great grandkids" --- this is that level of difficult.
---
imo, dont show her anything. Watching wow is boring as shit tbh it doesnt feel at all the same compared to playing. When youre playing you know back in your mind exactly what your character is doing and how much gold it has roughly, how strong you are and what level mobs you can kill etc etc. It would be too confusing to show someone a wow video that hasnt played video games much

Lok'tar ogar!

&gt;People back in vanilla did not typically world buff. However private servers simply found out that using worldbuffs makes everything faster and smoother, and thus it became "meta" to do so.
---
We absolutely did do that back in 2006. Most of the guilds that were raiding Naxx on our server did at least DM buffs + ony head.
---
I was a raid leader so I was in all of them.
---
The drama was INCREDIBLE. Loved it.
---
Standing IN the mailbox at Booty Bay forcing the enemy faction to "accidentally" hit you and get destroyed by the guards..
---
I'm going to guess that there will only be one RP server in each large region at launch.  If they add a second one, it'll be an RP-PvP server.
---
If they think there's demand for 2 RP servers, it makes no sense to have them both PvE.  But if they're only convinced there's demand for 1 RP server, then them saying "No RP-PvP server at launch but we're open to persuasion if we see the demand."
---
Remember that they're going to lowball the starting number of servers because it's a lot easier to add servers when you see excess demand than it is to close down servers if you start with too many.
---
Fuck yeah, sounds good
---
Last I checked the only true race is alliance. For the Dwarves!!!
---
That’s a really good one If both are next to each other! I like the idea of both names creating something fluid like that. Two rouges named BetterLuck &amp; NextTime or something 
---
I was Horde for launch, with my Orc Shaman, but I think this time I’ll go with the bad guys. Dunno if I wanna do a Paladin, Warlock or Rogue. 
---
I completely forgot about the Alliance has better ping thing. LUL

For the Horde!
---
Yea pvp set is great for sp, with r13 u reach huge amount of stamina 
---
I'm not disagreeing with your assessment that hunter/warlock will be first, but I will say there are very well laid out AOE grinding spots in vanilla that don't suffer from the problems you're describing regarding spawn tables.  
---
With that said, the grinding spots are far too known at this point and even a single mage entering the same area will destroy the exp/hour.  
---
I actually vaguely remember this. I believe there were issues with the character's head getting stuck in weird positions, in the same vein as the crouching loot bug. Or maybe NPCs had it and there were issues with Onyxia and dragons or something?? I remember some weird shit about that too.
---
This right here. The added advantage of doing this is there should be plenty of guilds at launch looking for guildies that want to do exactly this. 
---
I actually prefer questing solo since I have a rhythm, or system, that I use when leveling as a priest that's hyper efficient. Always down to group for dungeons in my level range though even if I dont need anything out of it. I was always an officer so this is 2nd nature for me
---
do i spy the WoW Atlas?!

Bet you could beat me 1v1 too right

AH originally, then proximity to BRM made IF the main hub and it never moved until TBC.

It's remarkable in the same way as someone who wins a car in one of those contests where you have to keep your hand on it longer than anyone else.

I would go druid, Resto shamans aren’t very mobile in PvP/wpvp.  Your description perfectly summed up Druids in PvP.

Why would you feel sad for them? Because they spent a heap of time getting something you don't want?

Yikes.

Where do you see that?

Resto shamans will be the most in demand horde raiding class/spec

If by advantage you must mean dashingly good looks, then yes I would agree.

If the api is open enough there is a possibility of having weak auras (Its ok #nochangers, just talkin here) And with WA you can set up your cooldowns to show right in your face.

---
What I'm trying to say is that if spawnrate is kept from vanilla there won't be enough black lotus for every raiding guild to use flask on everyone every raid
---
Horde  
---
Always Horde
---
LOL. Yeah, I'd save a lot of gold with instant respecs. ...so much gold. 
---
Maybe if youre tanking for raids, if youre dps its cancer to get gear in raids. The tier sets are tank based stats and theres only a few items worth picking up especially early on. Youll only have a couple raid items by the time the rogues are in full tier 1. Youll also be competing rogues and hunters for a lot of the good loot too like rings and neck pieces etc
---
Honestly tanking in retail, when someone pulls its so easy to pull off of them...if someone pulls in vanilla when theyre not supposed to...youre gunna have a bad time. 
---
Agreed +1 OP. Especially for a tank to be who hates tanking in retail. 
---
Yeah absolutely. He just did a major update so might be a few bugs to report.

It's at the top of the sidebar when viewing comments.  Doesn't show on the main page.

Cogswoth and Dotsprocket   (mage warlock)
---
Doesn't DS gives 15% extra shadow dmg
---
Do you know for sure? 
---
4 times higher spawntime than blizzlike on a server where a higher % of players raid, and not everyone using flasks, that is split on 3 different regions thus 3 times the overall population compared to cap.
---
That means there's roughly the same amount of lotus per player as there was on retail.
---
I actually expect world first will be a guild group ploughing through dungeons with building levelling crafting to supply pots etc. should be interesting 
---
Horde for life!
---
I raided up to the first boss or 2 in AQ40. We never did felwood buff. We sometimes did ony head, sometimes did zg buff before BWL. The only thing my guild required was pots and food buffs. 
---
Laurel and Hardy
---
I played Horde in vanilla and then switch to Alliance in BC and have been playing Alliance ever since. So I think its time for a switch back. 
---
Wow that's crazy! I wasn't expecting all that lol.
---
I left my first raiding guild due to being part of a clique and being picked up by a guild transferring to our server that was progressing on C'thun while my guild was struggling on Vael (guild breaker indeed). Our MT was going to join them and I think I was part of a package deal he wanted to come along with him. Nothing crazy happened. We actually had a very civil discussion on vent over the matter, we didn't keep any secrets from anyone about it, but looking back I wouldn't have left the guild if I could do it again, and I don't plan on making the same mistake again this time around.
---
As I said in another comment I listen to Preach's drama time at work a lot and this sounds like Grade-A material for that show, but I'm sorry you had to experience that. Some people just get power hungry and realize when they're able to take advantage of others, and it sucks bc your guild's supposed to be your team at the end of the day. You sound like a solid person to play with though just a victim of association and bad circumstance. I wish you all the best of luck in Classic my friend!
---
Tank and spank.
---
Gotta be quick tho
---
Now its just sad...
---
&gt; If the api is open enough there is a possibility of having weak auras
---
I have a feeling there will be almost all the current live addons available, assuming they back port the addons for vanilla data.
---
You don't want to have stuff like atlasloot showing the wrong bosses or wrong stats on gear (crit/hit rating instead of straight %), or having NPC/quests at the wrong coords from after-cata maps

I’m just going to drop in and say this: leveling hunters and warlocks is so much easier than a priest. Like, it’s a whole different world. On my vanilla warlock, I can solo monsters up to 4 levels above me without risking death, then it’s a quick mana charge and I’m off again. But as a priest, not only am I not able to kill things even three levels above me, but if I’m not wanding 70% of the health of a same-level mob, I’ll end up using more than half of my limited mana supply. Granted, this is experience from leveling up to 20, but the difference in ease of playability is just completely night and day. Also, it gives me s lot of respect for priests who can make that grind to 60. 
---
World buffs were a nice to have but definitely not meta back in Vanilla. We used it from time to time when available, that's it. Even flasks weren't meta until a certain level of progression because it was not easy to gear a full raid of 40 people with them, so only top guilds cared.
---
This is generally how OSRS operates, too. *Some* powercreep has been added to the game since its launch, although at a very small rate. 
---
I don't know why there's so much push back to this post. Op isn't saying to not use nova, just to not use it mindlessly. I would constantly see inexperienced mages drop an ill-advised nova and kill people because they'd all turn and melee someone together. Or worse have no feel for the range of any aoe and break every cc on the board. 
---
That is the tough point for blizz.  In the end blizz will need to keep at least one completely vanilla server available forever, and when considering where to go from there BC makes the most sense.  As BC is another one of those classic games more people will want to experience.
---
I too would like to see an enhanced classic vanilla through the OSRS route, but given that BC exists efforts on that front seem meaningless.  We can at least cross our fingers that a retail wow expansion ticks the boxes we might be looking for.
---
Hell yeah! Too many people focus on the greed and stinginess of how people were in Classic. It's nice to hear about the bonds people formed and the teamwork that truly pays off in the end.
---
Well, /u/mokacoffay? 
---
I stand corrected! 8/10!
---
He's got both flags, but a Horde desktop. You're right, since he's probably horde.
---
That's definitely a good idea. Give Feral tanks and enh shamans a tier set that allows them to not be crit by NPCs, maybe give boomys/shads a tier set that reduces mana cost of spells or maybe buffs one of their spells so they aren't eating so many debuff slots, maybe a ret set that changes how certain seals work.
---
It'd be tough to get it balanced in both PvE and PvP without completely screwing up the meta, though. 
---
In Dota a fun combo with the tauren heroes earth shaker and spiritbreaker was always called "shake and break" by my bro and i, like the "shake and bake" saying.
---
Im the opposite of alliance, screw thise blue flags with the lions
---
With the spirit of a shaman with a degree in warfare science 
---
Who evers having issues with me being horde just bite your tongue
---
And if that dont work and all else fails then pull your head up to my gun
---
This is the same combo my brother and I ran in Vanilla. We used to obliterate gold farming bots in coastal regions by chain ice trapping/fearing/mind controlling/scatter shotting/wingclipping and, eventually, drowning them.
---
We also had a hiding spot in STV near a road. We would wait until someone ran by and got caught in my ice trap. We annihilated everything. Ice trap into mind control can be so delicious.
---
Just better things to spend my money on. Financial responsibility. Your condescending tone is noted.
---
You might think he favors horde due to all the red and screensaver but if you look down at the heart of his pc you can see that bright blue alliance symbol.
---
As a healer I can assure you I will let DPS aggro fiends die if they pull aggro because they are impatient. Sometimes it is the best way to teach a lesson :)
---
Most roleplayers prefer PvE servers to PvP ones, so I doubt it would hurt them much. RP-PvP servers seem to be most demanded by people who don´t really want RP, but rather more mature PvP servers.
---
he did a very recent pserver run and got 60 on a hunter at 3 days 22 hours played.

Hunter wep... owait.

So I state a way of increasing DPS your not aware of. You don't look into it at all. Meaning I need to do more research?

omg I just had flashbacks lmao

Either way, I find it kind of releiving that it's not really neccessary until Naxx. That sounds very reasonable. I can understand having to do all of that work to down the final raid of the game.
---
Everything about how it worked on retail back in the day is true. I link to a post lower down the chain with some links to further reading on it. They're mostly just blog posts from back then, but you'll be hard-pressed to find stronger sources on this.
---
What I can't vouch for being 100% accurate is my knowledge on the latest private server developments. I haven't been following that ballgame actively for years, and grew even further disinterested in those affairs when Classic was announced. Though I still occasionally talk with a couple of people involved in TrinityCore development, and from what they've told me there still isn't a core out there with a functioning spawn table/pool implementation.

Just because someone values something or has a goal they accomplish doesn't mean it's sad. I feel sad for anyone who looks down on someone for doing something in the same game they're playing just because they're not "playing right".

---
Warlock has got to be up there. You don’t have abilities that are reactionary like counter or revenge. Mana requires looking less than something like energy. You have less small cool downs than something like mage. Death coil every 2 minutes is usually separate fights and not hard to keep track of, so it’s really pet abilities like fel hunters spell lock, but depending on pet, maybe not even. Something like shadowburn is something you just use at the end, so you might have to look when you are trying to use it on a second person right after, but your go-to abilities can pretty much all be cast as long as you have the mana, with death coil once per fight.
---
I don't really care if they add RP-PvP but I know others want it. 
---
aah noise.
---
Yeah my mind was blown when I logged on and saw I could just have literally all the specs lol. Ezmode but convenient heh

We would do a few warmup pulls usually then go out and buff, come back and get it down.

Vent still exist?

I am confidant that if the honor system is unchanged from Vanilla that over 90% of HWL / GM will be earned by charging $1200 on a credit card to Chinese honor farmers.

you can fuck off, rly. no one cares about your own doubts which you try to sooth by making this posts.
---
I'd say hunter, there's not a bunch of them in a Raid and they will be prio for ranged weapon
---
&gt; I will say there are very well laid out AOE grinding spots in vanilla that don't suffer from the problems you're describing regarding spawn tables.
---
Certainly, there are many areas that only ever spawn one type of mob even with spawn tables. But are there enough to maintain good XP/hr all the way to level 60? The competition is tough, and back in the day mages didn't come even close to beating hunters/warlocks, not even well into TBC. I find it highly doubtful that there was a secret AoE grinding strategy waiting to be found that was only discovered on private servers, rather than being a *product* of said private servers.
---
That being said, I have no doubts that previous records will be swiftly shattered in Classic. I just don't think private server routing will be anywhere close to being optimal.

My wife is not into gaming on her own, but is always willing to try or have a look into things I'm personally interested in.

Personally the biggest challenge I imagine to bring your non-gamer wife into it is the game play.

With that I mean controlling your character, camera angle etc. I watched my wife couple of times and it just doesn't come naturally to her. After a few minutes she gets tired or even dizzy. I just can't get her out of the starting zone with any character (we tried Hunter once and another time Mage).
---
Here's hoping they consider further patches after naxx.  
---
  Keep some classic servers and move forward.
---
  In vanilla I decided this was the game I wanted to play forever, future expansions kinda killed that but this is a golden one in a lifetime opportunity for everyone involved, blizz and players.  
---
Sorry, I cannot say. I didn't play the demo, and there are still some unknowns in the spawning system that we'll only be able to find out when Classic launches. It's also possible that the spawning system in the demo was not yet finished.
---
Rofl, just imagining a poltergeist scene inside of wow. Head spinning while puking from too much alcohol in game.

Everyone can jump away from my gap closers and 59 levels is going to be me screaming and bandaging myself constantly. It's a neat trick.

s priest lock is very good, really no downtime, killing many mobs at once, let the priest get most the killing blows and spirit tap will keep you rolling. If you're racing you can both get +10% hit early to move to areas ahead of the pack.

The top post of all time on this subreddit is about how blizz should progress after naxx with future content that follows vanilla ideology.

Fun video, but looking at the bluffs they have on, this is not from vanilla. You couldn't see enemy buds without detect magic debuff from a mage, and molten armor wasn't introduced till TBC (maybe later can't remember)

warlock per always walks on your left, you can often walk backwards past mobs to make sure the pet wont pull them.

They are probably just busy at work. It was probably just a coincidence that they had a few weeks of blue posts. They probably get together and decide what they want to tell the community every week and this week they probably just didn't have anything new to report.

UD rouge, wraith in apex, genji in overwatch, caveira in rb6, invoker in dota. The profile is the same. 90 % chance you're a weeb too.

Completely different this time. I like consistency and being comfortable, but when there's so little that I know about Vanilla, simply having fun and trying something new takes precedence.

It will. The problem is in server configuration, not the actual hardware. It's not something I would worry about.

I'm gonna have less time to play soon after launch. I'd rather hit 60 quickly and then gear up, than log in couple months in at level 40 and trying to make a guild party for scarlet monastery while they are raidlogging.

Hahaha this is my favorite so far

In Classic, PvP gear takes way longer to get than raid gear. 
---
I've played horde to death on pserves so I'm kinda considering doing alliance.  that and I really wanna play paladin
---
PvP servers weren't very hardcore because you lost nothing when you died except the time to run to your corpse and whisper some friend to come help you.
---
Being a level 24 rogue and being hunted by a level 30-45 Alliance Hunter or Paladin was a thrill I haven't had in WoW in ages. 
---
I signed on to the PvP server knowing anyone from Alliance could kill me at any time. I like that. 
---
I see way way way to many posts shitting in Horde for killing Lowbies and I'm just like "go to a PvE server if you don't want to be ganked idiot".
---
Aside from the obvious I see all these people saying stuff like "Raid Finder ruined the social aspect of the game reeee" and I have to ask .... why don't the people who bitch about level disparity PvP ever wake the fuck up and realize they can call a 60. That's a big part of the "so I'll factor" in this game, at least in PvP servers.
---
I remember on Underbog there was always always some Level 60 Paladin who wants to gank Horde but with a "personal code" that kept them from initiating. These people just sit around jacking off.i to their banks all day waiting for some Horde to fight an alliance so they can "not feel bad" XD
---
It would be like "Oh I'm a level 16 Elemental Shaman let me go try to kill this Gnome Mage who wandered into the Barrens while they're at 80% Health"
---
Then you get some lucky crits and the mage sucks ballls because they're idiots (as indicated by the gnome being in the Barrens lol) and Al is good. 
---
Then a level 50 Paladin shows up. Gotta get that raging hard-on for justice lol. Paladins can be so funny.
---
Did you really just... Compare.... Nevermind
---
I never even spoke of what the DPS were doing, AoE or otherwise. I simply stated that AoE'ing is definitely off the table for both tank and DPS if the sheep/shackle is close to the group and you don't have space or time to move.

There is something like slumber sand from the dust whirlwind guys that randomly patrol through westfall. Low drop rate, but can be used at 60 to put someone to sleep.

Also the very sticky glue from a durotar quest, for 10 seconds immobilise 
---
People have no idea how freaking ANNOYING it is when a DPS overaggros.
---
I had a scholomance dungeon run yesterday. (First time tanking it and I informed everyone about that fact)
---
AQ geared mage shows up with full PvE fire spec and starts pulling with pyroblast and polymorph. When he gets aggro starts kiting and spamming instant spells for more damage.
---
It is insanely frustratring and actually lowers party DPS because the tank does no DPS, no threat, the healer is using up his mana, forcing you to stop and the other (melee) damage dealers also have to follow a mob that is running around.
---
Nah, you did need good gear though. Some fights required more consumables than others. Like Maexxna in Naxx40 you were likely to down him the first night you saw that boss with a good guild that has AQ40 on farm status, but Patchwerk on the other hand required more consumables to hit those dps checks. World buffs is something my guild rarely did. We only did it to down Loatheb. World buffing a lot is definitely a private server thing, since it wasn't THAT practical to do it all the time in retail.
---
Adding the RpPvP servers post launch will cause one of two things:
---
1. The RpPvP community which will have established itself on one PvP server will transfer over to the RpPvP server, massively hurting the population of said PvP server.
---
2. The RpPvP community will stay on that PvP server. making the RpPvP server obsolete and the same things that happened in classic will happen again. The RpPvP server(s) will just be glorified PvP realms with a little pop.
---
Either way the community will be fragmented, something Blizzard doesn't seem to want.
---
Rp and RpPvP have the potential to be some of the most stable servers in Classic WoW since they are less dependent on content releases than regular servers. 
---
Blizz, do the player base and yourself a favor and add one RpPvP realm for NA and one for EU. We don't need more than that. Multiple RpPvP realms will fragment the RpPvP community.
---
I'll agree with that.  I for sure don't see a hw/gm in the world and think "oh no, this guy is going to be good". 
---
I don't see it as either pathetic or incredible. Gaming is mainstream now anyway. Who cares if a guy spend his free time in wow. It's no different than watching TV, which most Americans do enough of to earn rank 14. 
---
I saw your video the other day. I also made an [Alliance 1-60 leveling guide](https://wowleveling.fandom.com/wiki/1-11_Dun_Morogh). Cool to see all the passion people have for the game.
---
You are wrong.
---
Healer does not have to start casting right when I cast my pulling skill. While I position the mobs I won't really take damage, he can keep drinking. For example in ST in the circles (either the snake statue or minitroll) the pulls are so easy that I've managed to keep going while the healer was afk. Then the dragon packs are so hard I need an offtank+cc+innervate at start due to armor piercing, there is a big variety.
---
There are many pulls where the healer can just coast with HoTs or downranked spells and can regen from MP5 or spirit just fine. If that does not happen that means the healer is doing a bad job in conserving his mana.
---
On the other hand this is arguably less of an issue for bears because of Innervate and the self-heals. 
---
Expected a poll and clicked the picture. WHERE'S MY POLL?
---
Depends on what potion. Imo drinking a few greater mana potion at 60 is perfectly fine. They cost 50s a stack on my server, it is cost effective to use them and earn more gold by going faster.
---
Are you [calling me out bro](https://wowleveling.fandom.com/wiki/1-11_Dun_Morogh)?

Shaman tank isn't a spec, it's a fun concept you can use while lvling. Paladin tanks works extremely well.

Not when I played in 2005, it wasn't. People were focused more on the community and did not sell out that way, at least most of them didn't. Letting people pay you just for playing a certain class goes against the core rules of an MMO for me. Tanks are nothing without healers or dps in a dungeon. And they don't get paid, either. Just because there is a tank shortage doesn't mean I will pay even one copper to someone who decided to play tank because I think thisnis not what MMOs are for.
---
I saw recently that the orc hardiness racial may be different in official classic as there's some disparity between some people on what that 25% actually means. Like whether it's an extra 25% of the base 15% or 25% added on to the 15%, which means hardiness may be more powerful on pservers than in classic, which could shift the meta around a little for horde races.
---
 I'm actually fine and good with them adding new content that was being built. Like Grim Batol, Emerald Dream etc. But adding new items to current content and new sets etc. Nah, man. That'd change too much of vanilla and turn it into something completely new.
---
She a still is, wdym?
---
im looking forward to trying to gather up 10 paladins and becoming the unstoppable paladin bomb squad.
---
run into a group of horde divine shield and GOBLIN SAPPER
---
but divine shield is so useful
---
fall damage na i dont think so
---
i believe bop also stops fall damage not sure if that is the case in vanilla though
---
&gt;Especially if you're making the healer stop drinking to heal at 75% mana each pull and there's no mage in the group for free water.
---
If your healer does not buy water from a mage at 60, he is a bad healer. Lvl 55 drinks are hard to come by otherwise, and you can easily receive 100 water bottles from a mage for a gold that you can spam and only drink for 5 sec each time.
---
I had a BRD run the other day where we actually NEVER stopped for healer to drink. Every time I was tanking a pack around full hp he just kept drinking during fighting. Or just managed his mana well.
---
At some point waiting means less threat due to less rage, which is less dps, which is more time killing mobs, which is more heals, which is even more mana spent.
---
He clearly learned nothing. Tanks don’t get feign death. He just lost all the threat he generated. Newb. 
---
The first BRD run I've done as druid I didn't downrank because I didn't need to prior while leveling. I just spammed regrowth+rejuv and waited for spirit regen it back, since I lacked any +healing power gear.
---
At the 60 instances it was clear how important downranking is. I've slapped on some +healing armor and now I have 4 different healing touch ranks on my action bar, that is the only way to reliable heal at 60.
---
lock-druid is weird and definitely requires the context of Kargoz's video. Most people are thinking feral druid when it's actually a balance/resto non-moonkin combo with melee staves.
---
Yea, the people who’ve been playing vanilla for the last 5 years couldn’t possibly be ... good at vanilla....

How is the racing chair for extended gaming sessions? Been thinking of getting a new chair for the classic launch
---
I had the same monitor!
---
Priest’s can mind vision all the way through dungeons to look for rare spawns.

It's about average with my last chair. Not amazing but not terrible. I like the high back for sure. 
---
I like that you actually put effort into this meme rather than just posting the original picture with a title relating it to classic

can you imagine how underpopulated horde would be today if it wasn't for the belves enticing would be allys to roll horde instead since they can still be pretty?

why are you even in this subreddit if you hate classicwow?

This was an april fools joke in case you still haven't noticed.
---
1. Alliance are a bunch of racists.
---
2. The horde is incredibly diverse-in what other universe do orcs, the dead, and cows all join forces
---
3. Alliance=basically elves and slightly different humans. Like every other fantasy world
---
4. Alliance are a bunch of racists.
---
5. Horde gets cool leaders like Thrall and Cairne
---
6. Shamans are an incredibly complex class with tons of buttons, and totem management 
---
7. Pallys are the most boring class in the game with Ezmode play lolbubble
---
8. Alliance are a bunch of racists.
---
9. Horde gets the barrens for an expansive zone where lots of us can meet with a unique chat experience
---
10. Mankriks wife&gt;hogger bs
---
11. Humans that play humans lack imagination
---
12. Alliance are a bunch of racists.
---
13. It’s been scientifically proven that people that play alliance have lower IQs
---
14. Fuck alliance scum
---
15. FOR THE HORDE

yeah I played in the closed beta with my dad at the time and dont remember any head tracking at all. I was super young at the time like 6 or 7 but still this is the first ive ever heard it. Thought it was pretty neat when i started playing guild wars 2 and that has it
---
Did you play the Stranglethorn version or not? There should be a goblin teleporter to the far east
---
Lol, ur raging over one day old post with 0 upvotes. Go outside or something. 
---
obviously not posting for views or anything, YT isn't something I do. Just wanted to show a few of the experiences I had a blast with, and also to provide some nostalgia/hype for everything we've grinded for. 
---
Okay I misunderstood, sorry.
---
But it still doesn't make sense for me.
---
&gt;The sooner you CC, the more space you have between your group fighting and the CC mobs. 
---
Why? I don't get this.
---
If there is a ranged mob, it will likely be the one which gets CC'd. Or you LoS it, which creates enough time for poly to be cast.
---
Otherwise if this is really an issue,  a good mage starts casting polymorph before the tank pulls, but only finishes casting after the pull.
---
But on a rare condition the CC'd mob is too close, you just don't swipe. You do a demo roar plus a few white hits/stun/maul on each mob to avoid healer overagroing and you are good.
---
If the damage dealers aren't using AOE spells and are focusing the proper target, you only need to generate more threat than the healer does.
---
All we can do is hope that we get another blue post saying “soon/sooner/soonish” next week.
---
That's what I'm hoping for - and the low drop rates, too
---
1.12 wasn't the pre-release patch?
---
&gt;ny sort of hostile action by the tank (shouts) puts the tank above the priest on the threat table.
---
Yeah but try to chase down 3-4 mobs (especially ranged) after somebody else pulled. It really sucks and takes a lot of resources, even for a mobile tank, like a bear. Can't imagine how shitty that is for a rage starved warrior tank.
---
On a warrior when you are traveling stay in berserker stance since berserker rage will get you out of sap.
---
The community polls disagree
---
Only if the guild is okay with them taking up a debuff slot for moonfire.
---
I’m still holding out hope for tomorrow.
---
Yeah, if I can kill one mob every 5-10 mins, i'll enjoy myself a lot more than one mob a day if I'm lucky.
---
You’re probably right, i just am needy and want my blue post. 
---
But they’ve been really good and I can’t be too upset with the level of communication we’ve received it’s been great so far.
---
Filthy Casual

This is the funniest comment I have read in quite some time. My eyes are tearing up from laughing. Thanks stranger for making my day better after fighting with the kids this morning 
---
Should name change this thread to " How 2 get ignored in 2 minutes " As someone who speed runs Private servers to 60 as a tank i get a lot of whispers asking to tank XYZ and nothing shits me more than getting 15 whispers " HEY WAN TANK SM RUUN" or " LF1M RFD NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED TANK " and i know im not the only one, if i want to do your instance ill spam LFG tank in world.

BoP your flag carrier so you can pick it up and claim it
---
It reminds me of the predator's plasma cannon.
---
There was no tangent, even in raids 5% shouldn't make a difference if your group is good
---
i dont carre about faction that much tbh
---
No? I don't know who you are and I straight said I'm fine with the "Buy me a coffee" button. My line is drawn at the paywall's for a leveling pdf.  Asking for a tip, donation, etc is perfectly fine and I frequently support creators who do so.
---
&gt; If you spent thousands of hours creating value for other people I'd imagine you wouldn't mind some reciprocation of that value in whatever way you could muster.
---
I'm the most active mod on the Discord I linked and frequently test the routes we have. I'm just happy helping people level more effectively because I think $60 for a 110 boost is asinine.
---
Huh? I'm going to main either Nelf Druid or Dwarf Paladin but okay.
---

---
A balance talent?

You got beat by your other account

This happened around 2007 I want to say. Guy probably has kids of his own by now.
---
idk about that, horde have like 90% winrate on my server.
---
hunters dont have taunt, the bear was a noob
---
Warrior + Shaman should be good. 
---
Nice.
---
The classic xXBriansXBabeXx and ImAllMegs
---
No, Alliance flag is right where it belongs next to Teldrassil.
---
did the same to create groups for dungeons on a private server. worked well.
---
A perfectly legit reason unless Blizzard adds MPvP servers.
---
Started as a tauren shaman in vanilla, then transferred to draenei in TBC. In WotLKand Cata continued to play shaman and tanked as a DK. Played dwarf warrior in WoD for a couple of months.
---
This time around I plan to play as Alliance cause I never experienced vanilla ally questing.
---
I'm torn between NE Druid or Hunter. I don't plan to raid due to IRL stuff, so I think of tanking as feral in 5-mans
---
What server? Retail? Private? AV was so "unbalanced" that on retail all the bots just AFK'd on Horde side. It was really bad during TBC.
---
Really good compilation guide! Thanks for sharing! Can you explain how you calculated the "gold lost" in the profession tabs?
---
It was added in patch 7.0, not 7.2, though.
---
Its just your fap station till release huh?
---
So is mine.
---
More noise. More noise. More noise. \*blue post appears\* okej, stop noise.
---
Damn right 
---
But I unbound S to avoid backpedling :/
---
Mm. I'm going to try warrior again.  I just remember it being hectic as all hell. I would always mark initially but trying to swap marks in battle was near impossible. Then again I never did key bind. I handed off marking to others a few times and it helped out a lot - usually because they knew more than me. 
---
My guild used flasks and world buffs for progression raids. Killing Rag for the first couple times, Nef, Huhu etc. etc. It would definitely get you past some of the “gear checks” as we called them back then.
---
Nice
---
It makes no sense to roleplay as a player that is apart of a faction if you cant even attack or be attacked by someone you're suppose to be at war with...
---
Where did you get those flags?
---
Amazon. 11 dollars USD a piece if I remember right

Where? By whom? What does this comment even mean 😂
---
I've only played rogue and hunter, here's some tricks.
---
You can use distract as a rogue to bug warlock and hunter pets.
---
You can use distract to make people fall off ledges.
---
You can sap someone and use cheap shot to build combo points without breaking it, also expose armor.
---
You can name your pet as a hunter with your name to bug people's addons, it's also harder for them to target you through macros.
---
You can cast scorpid sting on a trapped target without breaking it.
---
If you have improved eyes of the beast, and make your pet go really far away from you, sometimes it bugs and it won't appear your name below them like "Legolas's Pet", if you name him with some rare mob name, you can really trick people thinking it's a real mob.
---
Very good gameplay, however I wish they wouldn't abuse of nogenfroger and deviate delice so much ....
---
That’s the date Nostralius closed down, would be a good homage to the guys that got all this started
---
It certainly depends on server progression but there are some items that can crafted for a profit not a loss. Deadly blunderbuss for the Ashenvale quest, Thorium Widget for darkmoon necklaces, mithril casings for Un'goro, bronze tubes (for alliance), Hi-Explosive Bombs for EPL quest come to mind. 
---
You also level gnomish engineering only to 260 for death ray and battle chicken, therefore you skip the last 40 points.
---
You craft sappers as long as they are red, yellow and green, because you will either use them or sell them for a massive profit. 
---
So that explains why the old models - such as noggenfogger - can headtrack too!
---
The real protip is to play the game yourself and not follow a guide at all.
---
My friends that played on EQ were calling this a mezz.

You can watch all their episodes for free on their official website :p
---
I've actually considered doing this only because I think fewer people will be using the NE starting zones, making leveling easier than in other zones. Even to the point of graveyard hopping to get there at a low level.
---
Dont forget mortars.
---
They are chargable trinket and in theory you can buy new ones, the trinket itself costs elemental fire which will eventually go for 4g+. However the recharge does not cost one, however you can only craft the recharge as goblin engineer making the mortar effectively only useable by goblin engineers.

Watch the speed kill of Ragneros. It was a vanilla WoW record.
---
No, you dont need to be gnomish to use most gnomish items like netomatic, battle chicken etc.
---
Only world enlarger and gadgetzan porter are specifically gnomish engineering.
---
In fact the gnomish death ray does not even need engineering at all.
---
You play game longer than me! Me pity you! Me still play same game for thousand hours though!
---
&gt;The biggest factor to leveling is not your TTK (time to kill), but rather the time it takes to engage in combat.
---
No no no : the  biggest factor to leveling is your TBG (time between ganks) ! ;-)

Mizoto is the name of the youtuber, this guy is hilarious but it seems he stopped making videos.

In what kind of hillbilly state is that a thing?

I leveled both a priest and a hunter to level 60. Priest are pretty easy once you get a decent wand + wand talent/spirit tap.

That was for your client only.

How am I supposed to figure that when every other post on reddit looking identical to yours is sarcastic and pejorative?

LOL truth about the ganks right there *shudder*
---
I'm curious to see how Spirit feels on wow classic; I think a lot of private servers (all?) didn't have the right tuning on spirit regen.  I do think the spirit on that helmet could be really nifty in BGs - it could make the difference between having mana for that last multi-shot after mounting and running between points in AB, for example.
---
I don't see what it has to do with my comment. It was in the hypothesis of the dwarf opening on the orc, nothing else.

Literally me... fuck sake I really am not into any other game right now. Not even single player titles. I just want this and nothing else... man....shit...
---
They're likely trying to decide what to do about pvp and some other big things, can't rush perfection.
---
Man, if RP-PvP existed at launch back in the day, I would have rolled there for sure instead of on the PvP server my main is on (still love you Firetree). I made alts on RP servers to roleplay, but it was just too lacking in the excitement that PvP brought, especially world PvP. 
---
Some of my most memorable memories of WoW back in the day come directly from World PvP on my main. No matter the time or place, there seemed to always be a good fight around the corner. Memorable highlights include:
---
* Brawling in the Crossroads with a buddy, then pivoting over to Thunder Bluff to raise hell.
---
* Hijacking Zeppelins with a handful of guildmates then pushing out wherever they took us
---
* Single person insurgencies in the Horde capitals, evading death while killing flagged Horde
---
* Holding Alliance-friendly NPC towns and holds across the world (especially in the areas between the former HUMAN nation of Lordaeron and Stromgarde)
---
At the same time, on my RP alts I also had memories of the various guilds and orders I was in, whether as a fanatical paladin fighting for the revival of Lordaeron and the eradication of the Orcish Horde, or as a mercenary sorcerer, willing to take on any contract (or sell portals and conjure food/drink) for the right price. With the characters I played as, fun adventures and experiences could be crafted in real time with other RPers and guildmates who interwove their stories with mine. I can distinctly remember various purely-RP adventures that guildmates and I would take across the world of Azeroth, whether it be to claim a supposed objective laying somewhere, such as reinforcing the Hillsbrad Foothills in the name of Lordaeron, performing scouting missions in Horde territory, and more.
---
The combination of these two can yield a very powerful experience, where the stories players can create are also developed through victory and defeat, then tempered through the suspense of any possible action that could be put upon you (or forced by your hand). This is where the realities of PvP create a real, tangible background and setting for your story, as opposed to sitting around relying very heavily on inventing exposition. Mechanics that could enable one story with one character per person are forced into two separate experiences, one for PvP, and one for RP, which are stronger together than either alone.
---
Unfortunately, it was hard to have a separate character on an RP realm that I could get to high level and play with consistency at the same time as my main. Eventually when RP-PvP came out, I had already put so much time into my main on the PvP realm Firetree that it didn't seem realistic to me to level another main to max level (especially another holy paladin, lol). I had also already established my online friends on my beloved Firetree as well as gotten my IRL friends and family (dad, brother, classmates) to play on that server as well. In later expansions I had leveled other characters on RP-PvP but I could never let go of my main.
---
Characters develop over time. This encompasses not only in-game player progression but also your ties in the server, with friends, your character's story/background, and your personal and shared experiences relating them all together in your Warcraft adventure. 
---
I am hoping that RP-PvP servers will be available straight away with Classic. If not, then I imagine like in Retail, those of us who love to PvP and to roleplay will be forced to make a choice between the two if we want to play at launch. Once the launch begins, we will soon be entrenched into whatever server we decide on, but we will soon want to have the portion we are missing. This lacking will remain on our minds as we play our characters, perhaps leading to a sub-optimal game experience.
---
I know in my case, where I am considering resubbing purely for Classic WoW, hearing that not a single RP-PvP server is available weighs strongly in that decision. Don't get me wrong, Vanilla/BC/WotLK WoW is my most favorite game experience of all time, but for myself, the lack of RP-PvP puts me into the "well maybe... instead, I could try hip-hop dance classes/get into yoga/wait 3/5/7 more years for Star Citizen/etc." category. Yeah, with Classic I can get back into reliving PvP in the world and RP separately, but the combination of both is what I am looking for, and from what I've seen posted here and other places, I am not alone.
---
You're unable to see when other players do this. Notice the tauren is the player character in this case.

I'm pretty sure you can just enter the instace, type /target X and see if it spawned.
---
That's how you only do UBRS with an ID that has Jed spawned.
---
Shamans can farsee into places that you cant neccesarily go into otherwise.
---
Also shamans can totem weave in raids, meaning they can keep up whirlwind totem on the melee group and then switch grace of air while the WW buff is up.
---
This propaganda is amazingly effective!! 
---
Oh, really? I never noticed. Thanks!
---
The only choice, what class?
---
Feral tanks can mitigate fall damage by transforming into a cat then back to a bear. Cats have a passive called Feline's Grace that lower fall damage.
---
Feral cats can 'powershift': change back and forth between caster and cat form after a 1-2 ability. This is useful because with the right talent and armor you get 60 energy instantly when you transform, giving you much more energy and thus dps. Same goes for bears and rage in some situations.
---
is there a tomtom addon to get the quest arrow for pfquest
---
The quest for bear form on druids can be pretty tough to solo at Level 10 but if you don't mind taking your time  (or are dying a lot) just pull that moonkin out of the cave and keep it rooted while your mana slowly comes back (5 second rule ofc).
---
Joana's vanilla speedrun was 4d20hours back then. His last one was 3d9hours just couple weeks ago. So *something* has improved from back then to now. 
---
And he's using the correct quest xp values and such. Such a huge discrepancy is not down to minisucle variance on a pserver but an improved leveling route; an improved leveling route he will probably provide to patreon backers while the rest will use the old one which is by no means bad, just not uptodate.

If your goal is to reach 60 quickly, gear up and dick around in the world because you have children, a fulltime job and a wife and can only play 6 hours a week, pissing away 5$ or 20$ to shave off 3-6days from your leveling grind you may not be interested in is money well invested.
---
That's 13cents per hour you invest into the guide. 
---
What about night elf huntard named legolas?
---
At this point it does not really matter how it was back in the day. You can bring the game back, but you can not bring the way how it's played, unless your guild runs 2005 style roleplay raids. 
---
World buff CDs are even useful up to some point if you're good at efficacious planning and know the moment when to login to get the buff. 
---
That's correct, not like it was difficult to filter out all the odd person with a name that matched your filter though. You could also do /who redridge mage and it would just show mages in redridge

Meh Horde used to win AV plenty. The negative stigma and "Alliance have an unfair advantage so I just won't try" has a way bigger impact on winrates then the minor advantage Alliance does have.
---
On pservers (always take a grain of salt), they have low health, low damage, drop marvelous grey stuff and full xp. 
---
All *private* server guides recommend killing them on sight due to these aspects. Will be fun to see how right or wrong the pserver were about them.

How do you kill that which has no life?

I don't see why one RP-PVP server would be out of the question. I've always enjoyed it above any other server type personally. It would be kinda weird not playing on a RP-PVP server now. That's my main server type. 
---
Yeah there is the whole ZG &amp; Ony Part now! There is a sequel too but the game ends too early ;/
---
I always loved fighting Hakkar!
---
Have you done it before? Isn't it like 2h a day for a couple of months straight?
---
I think the stam will make a difference, I'd totally take this helmet !
---
Woweee imagine somebody asking you something in an online game focussed on teamwork.. How could they?!
---
im using them as an example of items that may have skewed proc rates on pservers. im sorry you cant use you critical thinking skills to figure that out.
---
Where did you find this??
---
bilbo slaps you.
---
bilbo slaps you again!
---
You slap bilbo.
---
You have requested a duel!
---
Oh and that was healer and not Hewlett ;) 
---
&gt;Spawn rates are jacked up on private servers due to the lack of a population cap, therefore the proffession nodes and mobs required for these things are much easier to find and farm.
---
That is faulty logic. Nodes more plenty because there are more people to serve on the server. If there are 6x the players on the server and a herb spawns 6x times faster there is no difference for you as a lone player.
---
Naxxramas is just too hard without world buffs and consumables on pservers. They aren't an option, they are a necessity.
---
Having both ally and horde flags in the room is like wearing halfandhalf scarves with rm and barca
---
Joana's last guide in vanilla got him to 60 within 4d20hours. His last run just recently was 3d9hours. So he obviously improved quite a few aspects of his leveling grind when he can shave off a good 25%.
---
Then it was a bugged p-server?
---
AM should only proc stuff once at the cast.
---
Isn't it still there somewhere in credits or something?
---
Those are the low tier and easy raids.
---
That's a perfect 5/7 first time meme right there
---
They removed it, because the barman found a better radio.
---
Come on, would you want to listen to this while drinking plaguebrew?
---
Are you judging me on something I wrote nearly 4 months ago? Here lets take a look at https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/b7vhs5/warlords_of_draenor_90101_in_1_hour_39_minutes/ejugb7v/

---
But if you wanna be petty about it (directly quoting old material in an attempt to imply your content is better) I'll gladly look into taking money away from you too. Originally I was going to do classic as a side project as I don't care too much. I'm not Maeziel, so directly putting me under like that is uncalled for.

Backpaddling is worce in 99% of the cases in PvP because you are always faster without it. If you have time to move during the global cast of instand spells like fireblast. Striving away gives more range than backpaddling.
---
Even without keybinds binded you can move with 1 hand by pressing both mouse keys at the same time.
---
If people make fun of you because of backpaddling in Ironforce they just want to sound intesting.
---
This is a bad attempt at a troll 🤣
---
No fuck off.
---
Flying dailies resilience and dungeon finder are the antithesis of this sub.
---
You’re supposed to unbind Q and E to use for skills and bind A and D to strafe. That way when you hold the right click down you end up turning instead of strafing.    You’re on the right track, you just did it in the opposite way.  Also, S and Shift S are way too good of a bind to have it wasted on back pedal 
---
Holy fuck, i Haven't seen Liz Vicious for YEARS! She looked exactly like one of my GF's in highschool which funnily enough she showed me.
---
How about when the mob is to far away? I kinda remember having to move into the first room a bit in SM GY to /tar the rare Mobs and not being able to use it on the very entrance
---
Never paid for porn, but I bought Joana's guide back then :p
---
This is currently a combination of routes from Varrak and Xrewz on youtube and my own playtesting through the entire guide. Haven't seen anything Kargoz has put up on leveling yet.
---
Since Classic is not vanilla, we will have separate meta for it.
---
but... but where's mankirks wife?
---
You can be a competitive or minmaxer in a casual guild, trying your best to improve.
---
Arrest him officer
---
&gt; You can name your pet as a hunter with your name to bug people's addons, it's also harder for them to target you through macros.
---
Holy shit thats pure evil
---
Only if close enough

Roll on a PvP server and, for a small fee, I'll relentlessly camp her until she will want to roll Horde ... Or roll on a PvE server.
---
I see nude, I read 15 year.. I'm confusion
---
and? you bring 33 of any rdps to rag, of course it's going to die quickly.
---
Yes, burning banners.
---
It was in jest, you just perfectly described my guide XD.
---
I've actually hopped on your guys discord after I linked my classic guide a few days ago. Back to work I go!
---
Its not a sin to backpaddle. Unless you are proving others you are a pvp god.
---
Lario and Muigi
---
I think you've got it the opposite and he's doing it right, since turning with the keys is definitely slower right?
---
ehh the geographic location is the HUGEST reason. Fastest access to EVERY raid, faster access to MOST endgame dungeons ( Kalimdor, Plaguelands dungeons, Blackrock mountain dungeons ) and not to mention profession trainers were far closer together in IF. 
---

---
Get hyped! 
---
Curse Client does this. I think its called Twitch now. The destop programm. Hope it will work with Classic.
---
Funnily enough it doesn’t stop you from looting quest object etc 
---
This isn't going to be like Private servers though. But I get your point. 
---
Everyone has to do a mislx of both. Unless you are on a PvE realm.
---
I’m not turning with the keys, I’m strafing with A and D.  You only turn if you decide to hold right click down 
---
How can you support both factions? This was impossible in vanilla. Impossible I say!!
---
Ok so your way you dont have to right click most of the time?
---
I knew I remembered it being in the game!
---
I was always weirded out that I couldn't reproduce it years later. 
---
Wow. I barely remember looking for her material when I was younger. Crazy.
---
Yeah you only hold right click if you want to like turn in a circle
---
Horde have insane winrate on pservers but it's down to the bunker skip almost entirely
---
That’s what method were doing to mess with dos meters by naming their pet after their holy priest
---
You made a type. You typed Sad instead of Jelly.
---
I stand corrected then, will definitely try this out and if it works great #gamechanger
---
You have to burn one flag
---
But I need to know, is the Alliance racist?
---
Uldum
---
Yes PvE is far more popular. You can get ok sets of gear through pvp but its pretty slow and painful and the epic gear grind is absolutely absurd. Joining a non retarded 3 night a week raiding guild and you'll be showered in epics by comparison.
---
It might be even worse as the server caps aren't as high, so you have a smaller amount of guilds to choose from. 
---
And warriors really do have a hard time. As shaman I got invited into various guilds at level 57 and they took their time to run me through dungeons for preraid BiS. I was geared within a day raid ready and I had no gold yet, so they stuffed me with protection potions. 
---
There is just a huge difference between classes that people should take into consideration.
---
In pugs its even worse. The good weekly pug announces a raid and you can see the same faces arrive by wyern in Orgrimmar for inspection. The pug leader had to tell the warriors to stop spam whispering him and to stop jumping, because he had a good 10 warriors trying to get invited into the melee spot.
---
With just classic there is no expansion problem. And what the future bring? No idea.. but that is years from now.
---
It helps that games this year, and the past few years, have been generally shit.
---
I raided as far as partway through AQ40 and no, I don't remember world buffs being a crucial element for raiding. 
---
Thanks for this
---
Big issue with it is scaling in a way that doesn't fuck everything up is actually really really hard. I wouldn't want blizzard to try it as I think it would fail miserably.
---
Meh, depends on the guild I join. Alliance would be a fresh experience for me, but horde.. Female orcs are the master race.
---
How high are you right now
---
By rez you mean spirit healer right? My memory is that you only took 10% gear damage on death on equipment you were wearing.
---
Can’t wait ti gank Vurtne’s wannabe with my double pink pony tails Gnome&lt;3
---
 I always thought that was the noise of Scroll of Identify/Town Portal from Diablo 2
---
It's only an unpopular opinion because it's a douchebag thing to say.
---
I know you can do the Snake/worm things in Mara but you’ll need an invisibility potion is get past the hydras when you port in using the staff. 👍
---
Bit of a trip for me, I'll stick to Durotar.
---
How do you move your character, then?
---
I mean, most of the time in pvp I'll be moving a lot, with right click (or both buttons) pressed.
---
I just don't see any situation where I'd like to just strafe while not clicking. I just don't see the advantage.
---
Shouldn’t be tanking at all if you’re prone to blaming others for shit that may be your fault. 
---
Tanking is 100% not for a person like that. There’s too much responsibility involved to be playing the Blame Game.
---
This is next level
---
can you explain how you know about classic wow but have the rgb equipment and chair of a 11 year old?
---
Blue PvP sets are dope for some classes, and fairly average for others. Paladin pvp 3-piece is -10 on HoJ. Druid 3-piece is 15% increased mvmt speed on animal form while outdoors. But each class *only has one* set bonus. 
---
PvE sets, on the other hand, are pretty good across the board. Every class has at least one tier set that's incredibly dope. And there are so many set bonuses to go for. DGN set, t1, t2, zg, aq, t3. 
---
There was no "dungeon finder" in TBC yet.
---
I personally would enjoy TBC aswell - that expansion was just a better polished version of classic, with more optional content to do (especially arena).
---
Actually it’s the other way around. You go to Blizzard and get your guide licensed if you want to make it official. We decided against it as we don’t have the time this close to launch. 
---
I think it does 25% too all items if you rez at the spirit healer (if your under lvl 10 you won't get rez sickness) but if you run all the way to your body I think then it's only 10% to what you wear. 
---
Shouldn’t be tanking AT ALL if you’re prone to blaming others for shit that may be your fault. 
---
Tanking is 100% not for a person like that. Way too much responsibility. 
---
So, although this is a nice guide; it’s sort of moot, given the context of who should be a tank.
---
Horde since TBC. Switching to Alliance in Classic.
---
You can also use g- for the guild name. This helps if your server has a guild called "Priests of Westfall" and you're trying to find a priest or people in Westfall, or vice versa if you're looking for someone from that guild.
---
Release date or a beta announcement. 
---
Thanks, that just guarantees they are off the list. We’re working on classic as much as we can not pservers. 
---
So you just said leveling guides are bullshit just to promote your own one? Let people buy anything, its their money lol and you are not their mother lol.
---
WoW vanilla will always be the best thing Blizz ever made.
---
Super comfortable for me. I can easily sit a whole day.
---
I just didn't like when WoW suddenly upgraded to level 70 and all the progression I had made suddenly became worthless. My guild disbanded. Ughh... I stopped playing the day TBC came out. Or actually, months earlier since people didn't want to raid anymore. They just wanted the fear warlord gear that could be acquired from battlegrounds. I just hope that does not happen again. Would suck to play vanilla and have the same thing happen to me all over again.
---
Yes it's worse in pvp, and I don't keyboard turn in PvP.
---
But the act of backpedaling is not something inherently bad, it's just very very situational.
---
People give me shit for even having that button still there.
---
It worked all through tbc. 
---
&gt; unbinding backpedal and turn keys is not needed at all
---
Well.. I mean, yeah. It's not *needed*.
---
It worked all through tbc.
---
Me either. I do recall seeing somewhere someone making a guide from Kargoz route independent of yours, but I think they only made it to about level 30.
---
There is not really a solid alliance side all around guide. Most of them are pretty low quality.
---
Yes cause once again, s and ctrl s are one of the best keybinds cause they are closest to your movement keys, giving them up for something you never ever need is just being stupid
---
Yeah dude I can afford to just chill smoke and play classic when it comes out, must've made some terrible life choices lmao
---
The only PvP rewards available will be through BG faction reps and the honor system. Faction reps are easy enough to steadily grind your way up but the PvP reward system requires increasingly no-lifer amounts of grinding past rank 10/11 or so. 
---
You can get to around 10/11 if you're able to put in a few hours a night most nights for a few weeks, which will get you a moderately good blue set, but which will be outclassed stat-wise by someone wearing mostly MC epics (class dependant obviously since MC epics for some classes assume non-DPS specs).
---
If you want the PvP epics and Rank 14 you're going to have to take a month or more off work/school/everything else in life and play WoW full time for the duration.
---
Hasn't been mentioned yet. No blue posts.
---
Follow in BGs wasn't disabled until MoP, fwiw. 
---
I honestly don't know what to expect. I feel like allowing it is more authentic -- but with wow tokens and PCs being solid enough where (nearly) anyone can dual box... It might be something they have to disable. 
---
that's how u know it's a true goth edit
---
Oh boy I can't wait for classic servers being filled with people telling me how my way of playing is unacceptable because it's not optimal...
---
It’s not meant to be a slight, and if you took it as that I apologise.
---
I’m not familiar with your work, and the response was to the OP, with the links referenced directly from the links on the discord group. More specifically that there was a suggestion that this level of guide for free was equivalent to a full one.
---
I’m involved with several groups and freely share information and tips as most of us do. And I keep the full strat tucked away, as most of us do. 
---
If I can make a suggestion then, to update the links on the group. 
---
I joined intending to provide plenty of info but your comments on there make it clear I have offended you. 
---
They were poor examples to use then because you used one of the only items that we 100% know the proc rate for because it is in the items description. Maybe think of a real argument next time so you don't sound like a complete moron?
---
Trump and Putin
---
That shield is only available with the t0.5 questline in later stages of the game. Your best bet would be the Spirit of Aquamentas off-hand from the Linken questchain in Un'goro. Also 20 Spelldamage/healing but no shield.
---
Think it's bad now? Just wait until we get a releasedate... *That's* when the murders will start happening.
---
But you dont actually know the real proc rate for ironfoe. Thats my point lol. Youre so angry 
---
You weren’t as trash as this kid when you were a trash kid? Come on. We all were. Admit that shit.
---
Not really, just an actual unpopular opinion, unlike most "unpopular opinions" out there.
---
I mean, do what works for you. I was just stating how most people, including myself do it.  I love with W A D and use right click when I feel the need to, and occasionally hold both right and left click down 
---
&gt; probably a shit idea 
---
Nah my dude
---
It's *absolutely* a shit idea
---
He is feedi g you bullshit. 
---
You're right on both counts from what I remember, and by "unequip then run/die/res your way there" I was meaning don't use the spirit healer.
---
Awesome dude I look forward to battling alongside you my brother 
---
I am also going shaman, only I am getting me a troll. I plan on leveling with skinning and herbing, after I hit 60 I plan on dropping herbing and picking up LW and get dragonscale. I want to craft my own set and I don't really care about the money. You can make some gold with it but there are better professions for making gold.
---
Just look up what recipes you need for the profession you want and how large the grind is. 
---
- Enchancement does poor DPS in pve raids
---
- Enhancement has weak performance in pvp and is too random
---
- Elemental has major mana issues
---
- Elemental only gets good in pvp with good dps
---
- Restoration forces you to wear cloth
---
- You will look like a clown with a broken back
---
- Every time you retalent to enhancement you have to re-learn 2hander skill from scratch
---
- Nobody wants to give you 2h weapons
---
am i the only one who hates the term "meme spec"?
---
Roll a Gnome Warrior and laugh/facepalm at yourself every single time you log in. Trust me, it’s awesome. 
---
BUR
---
no
---
One reason is all you need friend: Shamans are Horde only, Alliance forever 
---
you would be 100% wrong. Fastest way to 60 is solo content and not a single instance. which is why Warlocks,Mages,Hunters and druids are always the fastest to 60 with the ability to solo group quests and Safety nets to save them ( Heals,pets,slows )
---
Can confirm the others but... surely Riki in Dota?
---
I have that chair. Great for the price but the long sessions do get a little uncomfortable. 
---
So the thing about the two hander is true?
---
About the overall DPS, is it like, flat out bad?   From my research, over down would be auto attack and totem twisting, and that's about it.
---
Saved! Thanks OP
---
I mained a feral back then. I thought about going mate rogue or lock this time around and even though the temptation is still there after doing some testing...deep inside I know it's going to be feral again.
---
You are correct, we do not know the real proc rate for Ironfoe. This possible slight variation is not a significant enough difference to really impact anything though. 
---
I remember our housemate trying to ‘explain’ to us how this episode was wrong in many ways. He was ‘he who has no life’. Me and my other housemate who both played too just sat there cringing at the irony. 
---
You guys write too much.
---
Blizz needs to have at least 1 RP server so that these nasty RPers dont ruin normal servers with their bullshit.
---
Horde priests can Mind Control Alliance Paladins to give pala buffs for their groups/raid. Take the usability of that with a grain of salt tho, maybe for pvp.
---
You can solo the hydra pretty easily- it's slowable.
---
How *do* you even level? I don't understand videogames.
---
OMG Literally one of the most epic parts..... (unless you Disconnected)
---
Is Mara farming easily viable from 46-53 on a mage? 
---

alliance. cause there are no bloodelfs in classic
---
Hmmm I don't know man, most of my skill binds are around numbers 123.
---
I have °, esc, and F1-F5 as skills (my keyboard has Fs pretty close to numbers), and gaming mouse butttons to crtl and shift, so I don't have to stretch my left hand down to shift, it just doesn't feel natural to me, going down to the "asd" row to press skills.
---
I've seen some of my friends move their hands all the way to number 9 and actually press shift-9 with their pinky and thumb, while still not using °, and they still give me shit for having backpedal on S.
---
I guess it's just preference, I'm used to this.
---
I totally agree, difficulty levels should give appropriate rewards, and blizzard miss that by a country mile right now, bad pretty much have done for the sake of subscriber numbers for a while now.
---
That is a far cry from "remove all but the hardest difficulty".
---
LFR, normal, HC and mythic can all exist in the same game, the issue is getting the rewards for each level right - something that blizzard can't seem to do right now (or ever) - maybe the only solution is one difficulty but I'd like to think no problem is unsolvable. 
---
haha and the sound was too loud
---
It makes sense to me. You said there are no roles in PvP but I gave you an example how there are roles or jobs in a BG and you can categorize some of the classes/specs into these because they have better tools to achieve them. These roles exist especially in premades. They are quite natural and common. Again, not a science. But in my experience for example a Rogue will solo defend a flag in AB, not a Holy Priest, because of the weaknesses and strengths mentioned above.
---
THat atlas will be up to date?! 
---
"Don't buy those guides, they're all wrong! Listen to me and join my thing!"
---
I can only imagine you must feel similar to me. Someone randomly calls you out, although you're more related to the conversation than I am. I'm not used to this. 
---
You are right, I need to update the links. I'm close to having a complete horde guide together with much more depth as found in the two links I provided you. However for the month of April I'm doing a charity fundraiser for autism awareness and acceptance month https://tiltify.com/@desmephisto/wowasan so I'm a tad busy at the moment. 
---
Feel free to critique the links I posted, I'd be happy to hear some improvements. 
---
Yes you can but it slows your leveling speed down by a lot.
---
People duel outside of SW now??? There goes my appetite. Holy Jesus Christ. I knew this game was on a Slippery Slope when I quit during Cataclysm. This only proves how right I was....
---
i thought it was the other way around.
---
If I remember well there is no much caster in SM armory so you could aoe farm there, stockade in SW has no caster either so if you're rolling alliance you could try it even you might be a bit low lvl to start aoe farm if you don't have very good gear
---
You can not honestly expect me to remember details about mob spawns that literally have not existed since 2010. Many, if not all, of the spots you mentioned were already widely known in vanilla/TBC, and as far as I'm concerned, that's what the discussion ultimately boils down to. Mage AoE potential was well-known then, yet they were not the fastest levelers. It is incredibly unlikely that there was a hidden mage AoE route that was not only substantially better than any other known mage route, but *the fastest* route in the entire game. It's even more unlikely that such a route would only be discovered much later on private servers.
---
So yes, this *is* one of those "pservers bad, give me free upvotes" posts, because in this particular aspect, private servers simply really are bad. The entire world spawn system on every private server that I know of is simply all wrong. Not enough data was gathered about how the system is supposed to work early on in WoW emulation, and said data has been inaccessible ever since the Cataclysm expansion.
---
It's not just the spawn table feature that is missing, even though that's my pet peeve. Spawn times, spawn points, spawn density, mob health, mob armour, mob XP yield, loot... it's *all* simply poorly researched, and it's ten years too late to do anything about that. That data is gone, and we won't be seeing it until Classic is released. And because so many people have gotten so used to the data that private servers use, which is at best an approximation and at worst a guess, I expect many of them will be in for a rude awakening should they rely on it too much.
---
I wonder if this was a conscious effort to put the Horde and Alliance Flags this way. Feels like the other way around would fit better 
---
me too.
---
JK. WHEN ITS RED, ITS DEAD!!!
---
Every time you lose a skill (either from manually forgetting a profession or in this case, losing it's talent) that skill gets zeroed.
---
This is why you have to level up engineering from 0 to 300 twice if you want to be both gnomish and goblin engineer (level engi 1-300, pick gnomish, craft gnomish BoP items, unlearn, learn engi 1-300, pick goblin, craft golbin BoP items)
---
Yes, enchancement shaman, retadins and boomkins are so bad at DPSing that nobody wants to take them if they have all raid slots filled (rare for a smaller casual guild) But even if you get an inv, you'll know you are getting carried, and if the raid wipes it is your fault to an extent. Especially when your guild doesn't have an overabundance of healers (which is rare)
---
But enchancement is best pick for leveling and you can do 5mans and do okayish in PvP (solo, not premades)
---
I have this bridge I want to sell. Interested?
---
Arena devalued bgs and made healers op and every game one of attrition. You're in the wrong sub.
---
Sooo almost naked 15 year (apparently) girl, yes the post here officer 
---
Very viable- optimal if you are encountering any pvp / same faction competition for AOE spots.
---
It's a bit hard to do as an early mage though- as finding a group can be challenging if you're far ahead of most healers / tanks.
---
Only works on party member tho
---
Is there any guides for this?  We just need to do the quest for the sceptre right? 
---
i feel attacked
---
Druids are among my favourite classes to level they have a rough 1-10, but once you get bear form they do alright. Just understand that you'll want to front load your damage with your mana and let your mp5 kick in while in bear form. I also wouldn't turn to cat form at lvl 20, keep going with bear form until you learn Swipe and 2/2 Feral Swiftness for cat. That's when the speed of Cat form really turns on. (Normally level 22-24)

Memory unlocked.

You think you do but you dont.. j/k enjoy paladin! :D
---
Can I tank dungeons as a Paladin or is Paladin tanking just a meme? Can I tank while leveling? Can I tank dungeons at 60?
---
but but alliance have lower ping!!... :P
---
Am I the only one that seems to remember that once a mob or quest went "grey" it no longer gave any exp. Or was it just it gave a small / insignificant amount of XP compared to your current level
---
If you do get into raid as enchance you will literally be forced into being a Nightfall bitch, literally just Auto attacking for the proc of your weapon nothing else.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169) Not to mention most guilds will be using those mats for other items so you will have to purchase it out of your own pocket.
---
Priest, Mage, Rogue, Warrior, and Hunter will all have problems with semi-overpopulation. If you want to play an in demand class for raids bring a Druid, or a Warlock. Most raids will want 2-3 warlocks for debuff stacking/summoning and druids will be in demand all the way through Wrath for their combat res.  
---
That being said, an instant cure for not finding a raid spot is to be the best skilled mage on your server. If you are skilled you'll get invites.
---
Dunno, I always considered Alliance to be a more mature choice:D
---
&gt;What do you mean by this? People will take/roll Hunter because the gear drops go to waste otherwise?
---
They'll also be relatively overpopulated by people looking to speedrun to 60.
---
Almost definitely not going to be enabled. 
---
They initially disabled it in bgs during mop to combat all the rudimentary bots that used it but since then they have gone so far as to disable it in world pvp specifically to combat multiboxers ganking people, so I can’t imagine they would specifically go reenable it when follow in bgs would be 99% multiboxers. 
---
There’s a decent chance that follow won’t even work in world pvp since the same strings that disabled it on retail were in the demo, but since there was no pvp we had no way to test it. 
---
if you got a overgeared(or higher lvl) dps its better to let them pull skull. you taunt skull and demo/sunder/revenge the rest.
---
a taunt after a aimed shot/pyroblast/soulfire cost no rage, shield slam/revenge and the mob dies before your dps friend gets aggro again.

Mostly cause anyone can call themselves a journalist these days. or atleast they do. I would argue 20-30 years ago Journalist was seen as a highend craft really. Now its anyone and who shouts the loudest. Sold tea on instagram? BAM journalist/influencer.

15 years old huh? Ima sit this one out boys

PSA:  In general dont "blame" people.  In groups unless someone is really incompetent you will get through just fine by adjusting a bit.  In raids just switch their job around to mitigate their impact.  Sure you can kick them in both scenarios but often that ends up being more hassle than it is worth.  Blaming just causes drama and usually doesn't achieve much.  Light constructive comments may help better.
---
Additional tips:
---
1.  If your healer is drinking and at 75% mana go ahead and pull.  Assuming you aren't just charging in by the time the mobs reach you they will be full mana.
---
2. If you are a priest and leveling as shadow, mindblasting mobs for the killing blow is probably one of the most efficient things you can do for you group.  Additional DPS and if you are good at it, dramatically reduced drinking time.
---
3. If you are a warrior and leveling as arms, sweeping strikes/whirlwind with a good 2hander is sometimes better than just sword and boarding on trash.  You definitely need your healer on board with the plan ahead of time.  If it works you will dramatically speed up the run and can kiss threat issues goodbye.  You can always swap back to sword and board after you blow your CDs/SS charges as well.
---
i dont like this discord because you are mixing bfa with classic, you should make a classic speed running discord only
---
This reminded me of the hardware store wow video 
---
It highlights the fact that if we dont know one items proc rate, then its not safe to assume we know the exact proc rates for the rest of them. Science amirite?
---
Will be rolling a warrior, while leveling do I just learn every skill that is available(in green) I want to make a specific build but when I tried playing vanilla in a private server I was just learning anything available to me so am confused, I don't want to start classic confused and learning whatever if it affects me later on.
---
Do I ignore certain skills from the trainer, I was under the assumption I would be picking the skills from the talent tree where I could see what I was doing and what paths I was choosing like fury/prot/arms.
---
Do we get at least 1 free respect in vanilla? 
---
If I do raids as much as possible with my guild, let's say 3x a week, will I eventually be geared or will there me a lot of competition? and how many fury warriors are likely to be in one raid? 
---
thanks for any help, love the community. 
---
Cheers I’m aware of your fundraiser and as someone with autism intend to support it 👍
---
So no matter how hard I try, it won't matter?   I'll always be dead weight?
---
I used the /who function a lot for making dungeon groups. Worked like a charm. 
---
why tomorrow
---
yup, not sure if I'm allowed to link private server videos.
---
You can probably google it though.
---
But all you do is get the scepter- teleport in, go to the very right of the "shoreline" of the lake you're in. Kill the hydra protecting the cave behind it, and go find the worms / turtles in the path beyond for good aoe xp.
---
Same for me, using QWEASD to move while also literally always having right mouse button pressed.
---
Backpaddling is important imo, especially if youre a tank.
---
Still, my WHOLE Interface, so mainbar and all 4 extra bars (5x12=60 Buttons) are all with hotkeys. Even Food, even Mount, even my second and third part of sets and of course the hearthstone.
---
1-5 I use, RTFG&gt;YXC^, M3, M4, M5 are my Buttons. Shift for all of them for the main abilites. CTRL for some stuff aswell and usuall ALT for that not so often stuff like Food and hearthstone.
---
Played like this since my serious outcome in wotlk and never had any Problems with it.
---
Boy if you don’t get your 4 foot ass back in that Antarctica of a starting zone...
---
Can you private message me it? Also thanks for letting me know 
---
You feel smart don't you ?
---
If you don't understand why someone would have paid a few euros for info that allowed to save something like 2 days played for every alts you were levelling, back when no info was available online except a few recommendations of appropriate zones by lvl then you're not so smart.
---
*Laughs in cinematic Anduin*
---
Welcome welcome! So, longing for some 40-man PvE-mayham or hectic catch the flag? Or perhaps just leveling slowly while fishing?
---
It's a option, but the proven facts are all over YouTube as to why backpedaling is inefficient and why using strafe is better. 
---
Did it recently, 3 deaths.. 25 mins 
---
How do you even see what buffs are on lol. I'm struggling to see what game it is because the quality is so low :p
---
In vanilla UD rogues were predominantly edgy teenagers. I haven't played pservers, is the new stereotype for them weebs?
---
There were so many little nuances to the movement. I didn't change anything back in the day, and often found I felt most comfortable running my character around by pressing left mouse and right mouse together to make them run forward. And yes to strafe, it would always be Right Click + A and D iirc. It's been so long though.
---
I was too young to ever even consider rebounding Q or E to abilities. 
---
Just announce the beta and send out a wave of invites so those of us that don't get an invite can rage.
---
&gt; Every time you retalent to enhancement you have to re-learn 2hander skill from scratch
---
Seriously? I mean ... wait ... it kinda makes sense, but this is so overwhelmingly stupid and funny holy shit.
---
I always blame the rogues
---
Gambling hookers for blow.
---
He cheated, no class can taunt and feign death, hunter pet taunt dont count cause its obvious he was trying to tame the moose, therefore no pet to use taunt, hacks
---
I can't remember but ... couldn't all the hunters in the raid name their pet the same thing to basically give someone a bit boost to "their" raid DPS?  I feel like our hunter crew did this ...
---
Someone hasn't tried some real good smack
---
Thankfully Blizzard fixed this in like 1.8 or something. It's not an issue in 1.12 and won't be an issue in 1.13.
---
Even ignoring the reply about mob density/spawn tables, there's even a lot of question marks that have to be addressed when it comes to mob behaviour. You mention BRD farming for one, when those dwarfs would net and murder you. BRD AoE farming was NOT a thing in actual vanilla. I truly wonder just how many AoE farming spots are legit in any way.
---
In raids Enh dps is abysmal. Even smite priests might out dps them. Their only saving grace is the fact that theyre shaman, so you wont be deadweight overall, just strictly worse than if you were resto.
---
You clearly don’t understand how the ranking system works if you think getting rank 14 first means you had to break the terms of service lol.. 
---
you just have to be in the top honour bracket every week for 3 months straight. With ~3k server pop how many no life premade groups would even be on each faction on an average server? Maybe 3? And you expect people to have a full team of account sharers no life grinding honour? No premade group is going to want to farm with someone that’s actively farming 24/7 by account sharing since that person is directly increasing the amount of honour everyone needs to grind, and good luck getting rank 14 without a premade. FRICK.
---
/u/kiskoller is telling a half truth here. This is how 2h weapon skill originally worked for Shamans at the start of vanilla, but it was fixed by Blizzard later due to massive outcry from the Shaman playerbase.
---
Not an issue in 1.12/1.13.
---
Can you actually use people's abilities when mind controlling them in vanilla/classic?  I remembering mind controlling mobs to get specific buffs but dont remember doing it for player's despite the fact if I could blow their shield wall/recklessness I certainly would have done so to add insult to injury before dumping them into lava ...
---
MAGA a fan of Esfand maybe? 
---
&gt; Elemental has major mana issues
---
In long bossfights/raids. For PvE raiding I wouldn't recommend the spec.
---
&gt; Elemental only gets good in pvp with good dps
---
Misconception. Every class has it easier in PvP with better gear. Shamans have a large variety of powerful utility spells/buffs through totems, shocks, purge etc. All of these don't scale with gear.
---
&gt; Restoration forces you to wear cloth
---
For PvE raiding. Not for PvP. Several classes that aren't tanking in PvE are downgrading their armor type. Warriors/Hunters often wear leather. Paladins wear cloth too.
---
Hunters are constantly casting, so it was not that great. Mp5 in the other hand was quite solid.
---
if your actually interested in tanking raids as a shaman, let me know
---
As a mage if you out of light feather you can always just blink before you hit the ground to avoid fall damage or death. Kind of well known but still someone might find it useful.
---
Not by doubling down as the asshole. . .
---
While I laughed at this, it's technically true. If you're being camped, you're not going to be getting any XP.
---
Bullshit, most of these systems were put in place since TBC.  
---
  From welfare gear to group finder to shortening raid groups, removal of world pvp, flying, easier world and quests, etc.   
---
  With time, these systems got even worse, you can see a progressive decline, the exact same systems just got worse, from group finder to dungeon finder to raid finder is a big example of it.  
---
  Saying that activision would just magically make things worse INMEDIATELY as they joined when these already existed before is people not wanting to accept this is blizzard fault.  
---
  This was the result of blizz not knowing what to do and listening to the wrong people while they headed to a crash that those complaining were trying to avoid.  
---
  Same deal with so many of their recent projects.  
---
So I maxed/raided as a hunter/priest/warrior in vanilla and I was originally going to change it up and do druid.  Back to 90% certain I am going warrior again for tanking purposes.  May flop back to druid tank though by release.
---
In PvP? Sure. But leveling, you don't constantly cast. The main source of your damage is auto shot. You might throw in a serpent sting and multi shot, but other than that and maybe a single Arcane shot, you won't be casting anything else. To be highly efficient at leveling, you have to put your mana to full use, while not being drained and not being capped. It's that middle ground that is peak efficiency. Spirit broadens that gap, allowing you to be in peak efficiency while using more mana overall.
---
I actually think this is one of their worse ones compared to their earlier work. 
---
Best of luck to you.
---
Paladins healing PvP spec is pretty much identical to PvE healing spec. So I guess it's fine.
---
I like the idea
---
Taunt should be saved for losing aggro, so when something is going wrong, it shouldn't be in a rotation because it doesn't have a short enough CD.
---
Taunt can get resisted and your hits can be missed. Hitting each mob with a single aoe while they aren't running towards you (but the dps) takes a lot of effort. Hitting them with single target abilities takes a weapon swing or a GCD.
---
Btw I'm not that versed in warrior abilities I'm basing this off of bear ones.
---
Considering paladins are basically priests with all the dresses they wear you might as well go Horde.
---
If you’re going to link your stuff at least leave a comment saying something about it. Posting random links to your content without any context kinda makes you look like a dink.
---
And even that is a token spot, because any warrior could fulfill that role. Or a resto shaman.
---
We know that Ironfoe was on par with BWL weapons. We know that Thrash Blade and Flurry Axe were considered pre-raid bis. Private server players were able to make estimations based of their proc rate to put them in line with where they were ranked in vanilla. These estimates are likely very close to their real proc rates, and if they are off it would only be very slightly. I guess you're right though, fury warriors will suck in classic.  Private server noobs are going to be so pissed.
---
It depends on what you consider dead weight. But yeah, there are specs that are so under-performing that any reasonably good player can over-DPS it with the right class/spec. I'm talking about a casual player who just stays out of AOE and follows raid leader instructions while using a single spell or a small rotation of skills.
---
TIL.
---
Dungeons and raids, not super hard-core since I have a job and stuff now lol
---
It would be interesting. Actually discovering the game again... Sign me up!
---
That's a fair point. I was quite busy this morning and didn't get back to it after posting. But that being said I'll give nore context from now on :)
---
That was a short lived, unintended (read: exploit) that blizzard patched up swiftly
---
Edgy teenagers all turned into edgy weebs. You will see so many undead rogues with names like "Rin" "Kimigori" Just a character they like or a missmash of japanese sounds. 
---
Yes, these are all valid points.
---
&gt;Misconception. Every class has it easier in PvP with better gear. Shamans have a large variety of powerful utility spells/buffs through totems, shocks, purge etc. All of these don't scale with gear.
---
Yes but a restoration shaman brings the same utility as the elemental one. So to be really precise, every shaman spec is desirable in PvP, but at low gear level elemental doesn't really stand out and restoration seems to be more effective. Elemental has amazing burst dps potential but only with proper gearing. Without it you are just another shaman doing shaman stuff.
---
I did see the tanking guide, and am very interested, but I'd want to try 5 man's before I ever consider doing a raid.
---
I love a challenge, but I would still proceed slowly, as I hate the idea of wasting so many people's time by getting one shot haha 
---
I am unmooved.
---
A continuation of my MoV series. This time, I'm recounting the story of how I got the Mallet of Zul'Farrak atop Jintha'Alor, and saved a poor baby gryphon in the process.
---
What do you all remember from this area back in the day? ^_^
---
We didn't use any world buffs in vanilla and minimal consumables and we got up to the four horsemen without problem where we were stopped by lack of tanks.
---
The encounters were very easy once you had the appropriate gear.
---
Did those, all of AQ40 and several bosses in naxx on my priest.  I was basically the same but throw in a few greater protection pots and demonic runes.  Never did Loatheb or 4H though so cant comment on that.
---
Huntingelf the NE hunter checking in. God I thought I was smart at 13. I also had 2 IRL friends both also playing NE hunter one called Deathstalker and another called Legoolas. 
---
Calm down ladies and bring extra knickers the lads will be on tour soon. 
---
Those Edgelords now all play DK on retail. 
---
If your metric is personal DPS yes, you'll be dead weight. Enh shamans simply don't have enough abilities and mechanics that improve their personal damage output.
---
Enh and Shamans in general are not about personal stats in vanilla. They are buff/utility machines. As an Enh shaman you can make up for your personal DPS with improved totems, Nightfall Axe uptime etc. If you raid with people who know what they are doing you won't get priority on gear either because it doesn't scale well on you. 
---
It is also not exactly a spec that has good gearing options from raids. So called "off-specs" or lets rather say hybrid specs got more love with the introduction of ZG and AQ. Several of the hybrid specs got sets that really synergized well with them. For shamans that was elemental though and not enhancement.
---
My personal opinion about the enhancement tree is that it is supposed to be a leveling and filler tree, rather than something to focus on during lategame. But this isn't something discussed alot in the Shaman commmunity. I feel like there is potential in the tree when combined with Resto OR Elemental gear + talents to broaden the utility of a Shaman. For example a Resto shaman with a 2h and the Flurry Talent can sill dish out noticeable damage while not healing. An Ele Shaman can do the same to make up for their low mana sustain etc.
---
I think you're right, it only works the other way around. That's what memory does to you :) So an alliance priest would have to MC a horde target and then have a paladin buff them.
---
Yeah because spending hours preparing for a raid in order to save minutes makes sense 
---
Shh.
---
Inb4 the 'im a casual I don't care about the try-hard mentality'
---
The biggest things here are the devilsaur maffia and the goldfarming. The latter causes insane inflation, causing the real value of items (the amount of time you need to spend to farm gold or it) to skyrocket for  those who aren't 'in' with the new goldfarming trends.
---
Yes, we had quite a structure for that actually. Melee DPS had their own chat, we as rogues had our own (because we wanted to). Healers had a healing chat, and paladins had their own for blessings etc.
---
It was quite a lot :O
---
I imagine you will have zero problems finding a guild to hang with and chat. Do you already know what you want to do at 60? Pvp, Hardcore raiding, rp? Then you can be a little more picky from the start. Or just join someone along the road and let destiny decide
---
Most likely raiding. I like to duel people for sure but PvE is what I like best
---
I agree that it's not "needed", but there are moments where you want to strafe without being able to hold the right mouse button - especially with classes that need to kite and want to use mouseover-macros, change targets without the clumsy tab-button or use some addons on the fly, that require clicks.
---
Nope. I mained a Warlock in vanilla and I loved it but I already relived that on a PS way back in 2011? I've played pretty much every class at 60 now except Pala, Shaman and Druid. Rolling Rogue for Classic since it's the most fun for me in PvP. Probably have a hunter alt too.
---
Only way to hide your form shift from the other side, They can react better if they know exactly what form you are in. Its bascily needed for that type of gameplay. 
---

---
You could just play PvP but you'd have to absolutely no-life it to get anything like the gear that other's will clear the early raids for. It's much quicker to gear through raids up to BWL (inclusive).
---
Even if they don't camp, some travels back from the graveyard can last between 5 and 10 min ! (Nelf have an underestimated OP racial :D )
---
So what you are saying is now that we have more knowlage about it Horde win due to having the advantage of being able to skip the bunker? 
---
Healer are in general not that consumable-dependent. Having better wbuffs and consums does not really increase raid DPS, which is where wbuffs help. Sure you have a bit more mana or can heal better, but unless that means -1 healer and +1 dps it doesn't really translate well into overall raid perfomance.
---
Ehm... if you bind A and D to strafe and hold the right mouse button you ain't gonna "keyboard-turn", you'll just keep strafing with the buttons.
---
Black lotus in classic will probably be much rarer cause spawn timers of black lotus on pservers are inflated, so most of casual guilds probs wont be flasking
---
Rogue + anything is strong as shit though. Have your warrior charge in and get all the focus. Rogue kills the healer or clothie. Ez wins!
---
Better Title if you remove the first sentence. 
---
Wait til you try a 2h
---
“Let me in!!!!”
---
I got that, but even as a viewer I constantly have to guess or check his bar to know what he's doing.
---
I dunno about anyone else but thats my plan!
---
Press W as well 
---
Should I? I'd say most people here talking about Vanilla have played on private servers.
---
Or ppl will do it like back in 2004 and dont give a fuck about pre-bis legs, flasks and DM/felwood buffs. Sure there will be guilds going for that and that’s fine, have fun. Let them. 
---
In pvp I can see the problem tho. But hopefully Classic will dilute those players far more then the case could be on a pserver 
---
Yeah, I remember using this a lot back in the day 
---
Of the bear, of the XX are random stats. Each item that sports that has one version for each suffix.
---
This is quite important when gearing a bear tank for example: A really powerful leather shoulder drops in ST, but it is one which has these random stats. So you might farm it and loot the shoulders multiple times until you get the best, which is 'of Stamina'. Currently I have one with int and stamina. Owl, I think?
---
Careful with too much noise, You risk losing the non RP-PvP community backing. 
---
They should add 1 server per region on launch though. 
---
Really like your interface! Pretty clean. Only the casting bar should be a little higher up :D
---
Is this the one where they recommend warrior as the best class for noobs?
---
That new info is also in the guide btw. He talked about some of the updates on stream about a week ago.
---
That makes you just walk forward while strafing...
---
Snore. 
---
With multiple servers and a reasonable server cap, most of these things will never be that much of an issue. Sure there’ll be competition, but the idea that everyone has to minmax is bullshit
---
Dueling area infront on IF as horde. Ariving there with 10 guys rp walking up the hill on awesome epic mounts. 
---
You misstyped female night elf hunter. 
---
You gotta move the mouse as well, to change the angle at which the character will turn 
---
appreciate you posting
---
its really is real satire when alot of this sub like classic appreantly for rpg and the adventure but at the same time alot of people also say if you dont minmax and have 9000 million consumables and BiS on every stage you dont gonna raid anything past molten core (i know doesnt mean those are the same people) 
---
Hehe. That wasn't my PoV.
---
Right I agree. You definitely want actual spell damage gear if you spec into it and preferably mail as well since we're talking PvP. Some of the best ele gear for that comes from PvP sets or ZG and AQ raids. Allthough the PvP sets are kind of all over the place.
---
[https://prnt.sc/n7i8ga](https://prnt.sc/n7i8ga)
---
Those people are quite dumb actually. Either they NEED those exact super min/max stats because they're bad or they just don't understand the difference isn't so huge it's impossible without.
---
Whenever I play drood I play it as an alt cause it's a very fun class for leveling if you have the good gear.
---
Is there any solid data on which faction won PUG BGs more often, on average, across all servers?
---
The emerald dream was supposed to be many, many things over the years. But as you suspected, one of them was a Vanilla raid, and also a set of levelling/questing zones. This AMA from this subreddit promoting an ex WoW designers now-successful kickstarter book about Vanilla's development and secrets had a good amount of info: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9fb2bo/john_staats_ama_author_of_the_world_of_warcraft
---
In one post one of the former devs mentions the Vanilla Hyjal zone raid portal being intended to lead to a Dream related raid. Another post mentions that the Emerald Dream zones themselves were cut for timex which makes sense considering many existing zones had less than complete amounts of quests for Horde and some just barely any at all. There is a lot more there and in scattered interviews they did with YouTubers, and I can't wait to read the full book 
---
I absolutely love the idea of the Dream and while I liked what we got in Legion, I do hope for more one day. I even got to visit the ingame, very unfinished version of the dream on PTR servers during Legion when some dev forgot to turn off the worldport command. It was neat to see them in the flesh but honestly there's nothing new to see if you've watched the youtube vids that explore them.
---
That's just moving in general... has nothing to do with strafe-buttons acting like keyboard-turn-buttons as you advertised it, which they don't.
---
Yea I LOVE all these battle royales /s
---
*Woah!* It's your **6th Cakeday** Nudvik! ^(hug)

---
Hopefully the remaining 5% contains some of this
---
Main problem of UC, is that taurens need to dismount to get through tiny lift doors.
---
Lacking an actual game to play people just theorycraft themselves deep down the rabbit hole and the zeitgeist becomes all about BiS and minmaxing.
---
Once people are actually ingame and getting BiS and every consumable in the game in your bags for every raid becomes more than just arguing about it on a forum things will change.
---
The reality is lots of people don't have the time to show up in that kit and frankly even getting that kit is a function of RNG: plenty people *never* got BiS despite running dozens of times to get certain bits of gear.
---
When it actually comes down to getting your 40 man group together the vast majority of even fairly competent raiding guilds won't be demanding perfection. The tip-top hardcore ones might, but almost no one else will.
---
Rogue + feral (or respec resto) can be fun! Both easy to lvl, fun to pvp together
---
Yes but you also have the option to just use A or D as a strafe rather than a turn which frees up Q and E for very easy to use binds. Do what works best for you tho 
---
You'll find out when you hear my cheap shot.
---
&gt;you NEED to do this, you NEED to do that
---
No you don't.
---
The whole min/max mentality is what I'm afraid is going to ruin Classic. Personally, I think that's one of the reasons why retail is ruined. Aside from the lack of server community, etc.
---
What timezone are you in?
---
I like that you like it. But thats nothing for me.
---
no, you pick up everything, generally if a talent allows you to have a skill then you will get it automatically. then you can work on your rotations but all skills will have some use somewhere even if not often...   
---
I believe the way respec worked was you would start and it would cost like 5 silver and then double from then on until it got to something like 30 gold  
---
you will eventually gear up though not knowing what systems they bring in from current for dungeon and raid loot i cant speculate how the shares would work out .   
---
In a 40 man raid you want 2.5 tanks, 7-10 healers, rest dps but the more you bring like cc the better ... depending on pack sizes fury warriors may not be as useful as some other classes.   
---
As a fury warrior you will probably have to learn to stance dance to truly be good too. warrior is one of those classes that can change stances in combat and use abilities that are limited to arms etc 
---
Gmt+1
---
Speculation because it’s the first week of q2 
---
This sounds great. I want to explore the classic world for the first time. Having a whole guild do the same sounds awesome. Just playing and learning the game together!
---
&gt; noone looks up strats for the encounters
---
Totally unenforceable and unrealistic, but having a guild of people who've never *played* the content would be doable. And probably a lot more fun than a guild of people who've beaten the content on eight private servers! 
---
By Riki do you mean Techies?
---
The game changed over the years. But classic will be as autentic as possible. People will duel infront of IF again because its the better located city. Leveling will be as slow as it was and sharding...
---
Sharding will make launch fun and worth taking time off work for. Cba taking a week off just to DC all the time, servers going down or 5 hour queues.
---
Exactly this. So many people won’t give a fuck about wasting time getting world buffs, especially if raiding with a full 40.  Completely unnecessary, until perhaps Nax.  BiS will obviously be a trend, but considering the term was practically non existent in 2005, I think casual players will be able to manage just fine.
---
I do agree on the devilsaur camping and pvp points though.  Will be interesting to see how it plays out. 
---
You think you do but ...
---
(I'm out of here :p  )
---
Nah imma just roll my prot pally, level with my holy priest friend, run deadmines an unruly # of times, level professions as I level (even maybe god forbid mining + BS), not give af about ur dumb black lotus spawns, enjoy the journey and smell the roses. If you’re looking at vanilla thru the lens of a calculator I think you should play minesweeper instead

 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Paladin/Abilities](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Paladin/Abilities) I couldnt find a taunt in this list. I didnt spend much time though and maybe its in the talent tree somewhere. maybe it will be added by blizzard...   
---
But without a forced taunt, in raids, you will have to be a high tps tank with no good way to tank swap for stacking debuffs and instant kill mechanics ...   
---
In 5 mans, that could still be okay but if anyone out gears you by a tier, you will probably struggle 
---
&gt; easy to reach
---
Only usable with middle finger, can’t press while running. Real easy to reach. 
---
This.
---
And Devilsaur mafia can't exist on PVE servers and will get banned from PVP servers by Blizzard.
---
&gt; Will be rolling a warrior, while leveling do I just learn every skill  that is available(in green) I want to make a specific build but when I  tried playing vanilla in a private server I was just learning anything  available to me so am confused, I don't want to start classic confused  and learning whatever if it affects me later on. 
---
As a general rule, yes, you should learn everything your class trainer can teach you. Problem is, spells and abilities are expensive, so you're forced to pick and choose. Needless to say, some abilities are more important than others and should be prioritised.
---
&gt; Do we get at least 1 free respect in vanilla? 
---
Kind of. Your first respec is 10 silver, your second respec is 1g, and your third is 5g. From there the cost increases by 5g each time you respec to a maximum of 50g. As a general rule, try to avoid respeccing as much as possible. Use a [talent calculator](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0) to plan ahead.
---
&gt; And what professions should I learn and should I start dealing with them as early as possible? 
---
Professions are entirely up to you. You can take whatever you want, for whatever reason. However, it should be said that different professions provide different items that benefit certain classes/specs more than others. For example, [Force Reactive Disk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18168), an Engineering item, is incredibly useful for tanking.
---
Ultimately, however, it depends on what you plan to do. A casual Warrior might take two gathering professions and spend all day gathering, whereas a PvPer might take Engineering. I recommend you do your own research and decide which professions best suit your play style.
---
As for whether or not you should deal with your professions as soon as possible, I would say yes. Often times you'll see people leaving certain professions (namely Engineering) until 60 and then leveling them via the AH, but that comes with it's own pros and cons. The most simple and least problematic way of leveling professions is to level them as you level your character.
---
&gt; If I do raids as much as possible with my guild, let's say 3x a week,  will I eventually be geared or will there me a lot of competition? 
---
I can't comment on this. No idea.
---
&gt; and how many fury warriors are likely to be in one raid? 
---
I think there's usually 5-ish Fury Warriors in a raid. Entirely up to the raid leader though.
---
The name ruling is the only diffrence from Blizzards side. But the playerbase tend to play the game diffrently on RP realm. Hanging more in city's. Talking like they ARE there character and organize RP events. Recreating scene's etc.
---
Its not my type of playstyle eigther but I love that people that play that way have there own place for it. If there were no RP realm and you see a guy walking around in white farmer gear pretending to be a farmer. You call him crazy. But on RP realms they will walk into other players also living there story.
---
Why RP-PvP? Because some like to RP without the fun of world pvp and some like it with the fear of world pvp. 
---
Oh really? Well I'm jumping aboard this hype train then!
---
Do games usually get released at the beginning of quarters?
---
herbalism and alchemy is always useful and always worth it. leatherworking was very class specific, i dont think it made any of the qol things until much later in the expansions.
---
tailoring and enchanting was always a good combination for the same reasons as herb+alc
---
Now the question I would like to ask is : Why would you possibly waste such a cool and rare set BY RE-RACING DWARF ? D:
---
We usually call it tilde, which is the squiggly line over an ñ. But, it has an apostrophe too. 
---
Sampletext and Unknown
---
Not so much released but big pockets of information are, in order to boost quarterly stocks 
---
/u/EsfandTV ‘s hat! Got one myself. Awesome setup dude!
---
Anyone that can use a shield should get Olaf’s All Purpose Shield from Uldaman. It’s really useful, and essential for AB. 
---
&gt; there is no much caster in SM armory so you could aoe farm there 
---
How can you aoe farm caster mobs ? You just take the hits and hope they die before you ?
---
Ah I see, so it's more likely tomorrow then that we will get just more news, cheers
---
Sap is a charm or fear?
---
You are right, most casual people wont give a fuck about this, but here the thing: this post isnt targeted for them.
---
Today, once America wakes up
---
What was that addon called again for the information bar on top of the screen?
---
How high are you?
---
Is it right, that Druids can do alot of diffenrent roles. But has a smaller tool-kit for each role? Compared to non-hybrids?
---
So if i only want to heal, i'll better roll something else?
---
There’s a max distance on /target. 
---
I think you should play the game your way and not tell people how they should enjoy the game? This post isnt targeted for people who intend to play casually and not min-max and contains good info for those who do, so why do you have to get buthurt over it?
---
Hello fellow Boomer! I hope your staying fit dont worry about the balding. 
---
just makes you look like a salty kiddo tbh.
---
[Hunter = Satan](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9wyn1v/taming_the_most_common_animal_in_starting_zones/)
---
The time they enabled it in Legion was pretty great, because you could explore using Demon Hunters. Google Hayven Games Legion Dungeon video for one of the most mysterious unfinished areas. There were several other new to Legion unreleased areas my friends and I saw on PTR that night, including Alpha Suramar City and a strange unused Illidan DH "scenario" minizone that resembled a small floating island in the interstitial sections of outland between zones, with the spirit of Illidan.
---
One neat thing to note is that many of the old, pre Cataclysm WorldPort coordinates that we found on old forums did not work. The obvious ones were any Vanilla WoW areas including exclusive stuff like Old Hyjal. Some others that did not function, presumably because they were tied to the Pre Cataclysm Build of EK/Kalimdor, were Alpha/Old Hellfire Peninsula and Aszhara Crater. However, every single Emerald Dream section was intact, as was GM island. 
---
I’d actually be happy with that being implemented in classic.
---
I was planning on it. Casual play 😂
---
well most of them were close to full T3.
---
A counter-argument:
---
**First**, the pserver crowd is, what, a few tens of thousands of active players at most? I think Nostalrius had ~150k "active" accounts but their servers never went above ~10k online at any given time. Spread all of those over the various worldwide WoW regions that Retail is divided into. Even if you had servers exclusively reserved for ex-pserver players you're probably only going to fill up 2-3 of them per region.
---
**Second**, the very nature of pservers attracts the hardcore fans. Hardcore fans are always in the minority of a fanbase: there will be a great many new players to Classic who will come from Retail or non-WoW background and who find they enjoy Classic more than modern Retail WoW.
---
We all know the many reasons Classic represents a better game than Retail so I won't list them, this is a subreddit of the already-converted.
---
**Third**, pservers are emulations and we can't assume the metas and strategies that worked for them will work for Classic. Will there be an Un'Goro Mafia? I'm certain of it. Will there be the same market for Devilsaur items when servers have no more than ~4-5kish unique accounts (with active player caps at ~2-3k), a significant (and growing, as time goes on) chunk of which will be non-pserver veterans? No. The OG Mafia can try to sell blues for 300g a pop if they want, but their market will be *substantially* different to the market on pservers: it will be far smaller (supply and demand) and likely contain many more casual players.
---
**In conclusion** I don't believe drawing conclusions from pserver metas is the right thing to do. You're studying what happens when all the most hardcore fans out there are stuffed into the same room. It's obviously going to be an elitist shitfest. The mass-market retail version which will include all the casuals and divide everyone into a far larger number of far smaller rooms will be a *very* different community.
---
A dwarf warrior. 4 druids in one raid! A NE priest! Human mages! Human priests! it's obvious you were terribly inefficient.
---
/s
---
&gt; it's a very fun class for leveling if you have the good gear
---
to me it's quite fun and challenging without the good gear, and also it is quite fun in endgame dungeons and raids, I'd say, especially as a support role, which WoW ultimately lacks.
---
What the hell is this garbage? Go back to your private server. I’m good. Thanks. 
---
Imagine being this much of a no-lifer lmao.
---
You can also hold both mouse-buttons when you wanna use "S" or strafe or bind abilities that require you to stand still already. Better than not using it at all or using it for backpedaling.
---
Can't watch the video. Could you post a short TLDR what this is about?
---
Eh.
---
Once the Classic servers open the population from private servers that decides to play Classic will do one of two things. 1) They could go to the same Classic server. So they just recreate the same pserver environment. Enjoy. 2) They spread out over the official servers. So their influence on the markets, camping spawn points, etc will be limited. For us casuals, their influence will be notable before we end up getting too invested on a server. So if there are too many of them, just roll a different server and everyone can enjoy their game.
---
I think it’s targeted at everyone planning on playing classic wow. 
---
The post was not about backpedaling being efficient.
---
It's about being able to strafe with normal turn keys, and still having backpedal key there for the  few times it's useful (only tanking afaik).
---
I never said I use backpedal to turn around, instead I did say that I turn around with the mouse.
---
I know I'm bad at english but it seems like everyone saw me as a clicker who's proud of keyboard-turning or something.
---
It really doesn't.
---
Na that was 2.0
---
&gt;What's the difference between PVP and RP-PVP? Why cant you Role Play on a PVP server? 
---
What's the difference between PvE and RP? Why can't you roleplay on a PvE server?
---
Same difference. People want an RPPvP server for the same reason they want an RP server: the entire point of the server is to create worldwide RP that is enforced by the server style. Only with RPPvP you also get Contested zones.
---
Enhancement shaman could be the Nightfall debuff giver in raids. It's a 2h wep that has a chance to increase spell dmg taken by 15% for 5 sec.
---
Off tank warrior is propably more optimal for that job though.
---
Why? Because he actually played retail vanilla? And knows you don’t need to have every buff imaginable to raid. I raided through aq40/bwl/early naxx with no consumables back in the day.  P server noobs think you need them.
---
but he is in negative, should be black skin and white clothes on black T-shirt
---
Yes exactly that. Although with healing  Druids have more heal over time spells than direct heals. 
---
Incapacitate
---
It’s not April 1st anymore mate.  You don’t need any of this, anyone saying you do never actually played during vanilla.
---
Too much, you need a crt, a 32mb graphics card, a generic microsoft laser mouse, mechanical hdd, and your mums kitchen chair
---
Thanks so much for this! really helped me out
---
All four of those can do dungeons well. By the time a casual gets the chance to raid, I'm sure the tier 0.5 set will be out so the elemental shaman can be viable enough for a casual raid guild.
---
If you are worried about money, rogue and mage might be your best bets. Mages level easily and AOE farm really well. Rogues can do some sneaky pickpocketing to get some good money at 60. 
---
Titan Panel.
---
&gt; Mage AoE potential was well-known then,  yet they were not the fastest levelers.
---
Think of hunter speedrunners from Vanilla, who comes to mind? Now, do the same for mages and conjure up that blank. Outside of *In Frost We Trust* and k4li's *Art of Grinding* guides, I doubt either of us can think of anyone who actually worked on the routing.
---
But now I can think of several who are doing the work on what are the best approximations of Vanilla that we have. These people aren't unintelligent and are aware of the discrepancies that might occur when the real deal arrives. 
---
In the highly documented locations I listed: Spawn tables won't be much different, density is right, mob health won't differ enough to matter, mob armor doesn't matter for mage, and XP yield is verifiable. 
---
So wanted to roll a resto druid in classic but the I ternet has convinced me they're pure shit and raids only take 2 maximum, rendering it you likely to get a raid soot in a good guild, so I doubt I'll play one now unfortunately.
---
Seeing as my goal is unfinished business in aq40 and naxx I'm a bit down on them.
---
But I will be getting and bringing consumables. I loved the idea of consumables, an item that gives you a temporary buff, but is consumed in the progress, so use it wisely. 
---
In most of today's MMOs, the difference between consumables and cooldowns is that consumables may take another slot in inventory, if you don't vendor them regularly. 
---
In vanilla WOW, consumables were actually consumables - something you had to decide to use, not keep spamming.
---
They're a perfectly viable class, but if your goal is AQ40 and Naxx, then picking something that's more "guaranteed" a raid spot is reasonable.
---
Klling the final boss in naxx?
---
like im sorry but this post is sad. imagine being like this
---
English is not my first language so maybe I did formulate my sentence wrong but I think that "there is no much caster" means that you won't have to fight caster while in there.
---
To answer your question, you don't aoe farm caster mobs.
---
is it a troll or a very dumb person?
---
all of these thing will work entirely different if its not a bamboozele overpopulated mega private server active in all timezones all the time. 
---
we don't even know what serevr cap pop gonna be. aswell as crossserver bgs or not and so on. 
---
such hardcore devilsaur mafia is a sign of a this overpopulated international private servers. camping devilsaur 24/7. It won't really happen in such fashion on 3-4k pop server. aswell as such crossfaction cooperation is banable as far as i know.
---
ranking as i said. lower pop servers works differently, there are maybe 2 premades at best from both sides. Aswell as crossserver bgs or not. 
---
pvp - 99% of ppl finely without most of it, if few 1% tryharders do this. watch swifty videos ppl been using back in the day aswell. You can absolutely finely play and rank up without it.
---
World buffs worked differently you couldnt spam sapwn heads of boss in orgri it had 4-6 hours cd. Aswell most of these things not required for most raids. 
---
yup ppl didn't goldfarm back in the day.. yup its more optimized now so what? 
---
The mouseover macros are actually a very good point.
---
Most addons have the option to bind keyboard keys to them though, through the normal keybind menu.
---
As for the backpedal thing, I do find it easier backpedaling. Is it achievable without it? Absolutely, but the movement is way more inconsistent and requires more attention.
---
If I didn't have a gaming mouse I'd consider it, but right now I don't see how one extra key bind is worth scrapping a core movement key 
---
&gt; Once people are actually ingame they'll find getting BiS and every consumable in the game in your bags for every raid becomes more than just arguing about it on a forum things will change.
---
You know people have been doing that for years now, right? It's not "arguing about it on a forum because you're bored", it's how competitive guilds work.
---
Nobody forces you to do anything if you don't want to, but with that attitude you're probably not in a top guild anyway. Why do you try so hard to make it sound like a bad thing while you're not even concerned? Let people play how they want. :)
---
&gt; The reality is you're going to start wanting to raid regardless of what your gear is and there will be very very very few people rocking BiS in every slot pre-raid
---
And that's why pre-raid items lists suggest 4-5 items for every slot, so you can find alternatives if you're unluckly with loots/rolls. 
---
Yeah I've done fucking about in bwl and mc. Like an ass man, I'm in it for the backend now.
---
Gonna have to play fucking paladin aren't I, Christ.
---
&gt;He seems to be very knowledgable.
---
What evidence do you base that conclusion on? He has literally no inside information, so how can he know? Anyone who tries to put on a date is purely guessing. It could be august as well, would still fit perfectly with what we have been told by Blizzard (summer release).
---
&gt;Guess I need to temper my expectations haha! Thats a long wait.....
---
And how is that a longer wait than expected? If anything, getting a mid-July release would be *extremely* early. Summer can be defined a few ways depending on what country and method is used, but in general for game release July is seen as an *early* summer release.
---
What if I just want to play? I ran through Azeroth dozens of times, minmaxed my characters, raided 5 nights a week in a server first guild in TBC. I don't give a rat's ass about Devilsaur leggings, those won't stay out of the fire for you.  I'm going to read every single quest and never set foot in un'goro. Somebody wants to suck out the fun from my game? Let them try, it ain't happening.
---
Yeah I do know, on pservers, which are pretty much the preserve of hardcore fans. A year down the line post-Classic launch they're either going to be in the minority of the playerbase or we're all going to be very worried about Classic's future because Blizzard won't see any profit in keeping a unique set of servers running for a small number of people.
---
Think i might do warrior and just get mage high enough to farm gold
---
I'm in USA eastern time unfortunately...but first thing I would do is find a guild with similar hours of yours, for questing/leveling. raid schedules will probably take a little to form, since it will take time to get to 60, and then get pre raid BIS, but I'm sure there will be some guild that will buddy
---
Same. But wonder...how is pre-aq40 and pre-naxx BiS gear impact overall resto druid performance? If I collect best gear before each of those instances, I wiil be still not viable?
---
Shit up you mug
---
When I search for Classic PvP Content on youtube for example and end up with the Private Server guys who play like that I see the same \~20 people over and over again.
---
I was in the \~3rd best guild on my Server and we didnt even bother about the diremaul tribute run , and it was not because we didnt know about it, there just arent that many hardcore players around.
---
40 players PER SERVER who farm Devilsaur all day ? Ok now you are just trolling :D
---
Calling someone who killed KT in vanilla a kid is a little strange. I mean, calling anyone a "kiddo" is dumb, but calling a like 30 year old that makes no sense.
---
Yeah but I'd there's 2 other druids youre fucked. It's the hunter of healers. One step above meme spec apparently.
---
Every time I see both Alliance and Horde banners it remind me of my nephew who had both Liverpool and United flags on his bedroom wall as a kid. 
---
They're an RP server just with PvP turned on in contested zones. 
---
Also the people going to these servers usually do so with the intention of doing planned world PvP. Yes you can also get world PvP on a PvP server, but when BGs are out, a lot of people just tend to sit in them to rank up. On rp-pvp servers guild masters will always be hosting events that involve PvP with the other faction. 
---
For example, I played in a horde guild on a pserver that constantly did raids into stranglethorn, duskwood, Redbridge-- and there was an alliance guild that did the same back to us. It became a fierce rivalry between the two guilds; whenever you saw someone from that guild in the world you had to ensure you killed them in the name of the guild. When they would try to attack orgrimmar, it wasn't the rank 14s or the hard-core raiders that came to it's defence, it was us.
---
I imagine this to be the general attitude that will be of the players on an rp-pvp server. On a PvP server, players goals usually only involve ranking up, raiding and maybe some ganking/1vX world PvP. On an rp-pvp server, your guilds honour is at stake and you do world PvP for the RP reasons as well as it being fun. In fact, after both the guild masters of those pserver guilds quit for irl reasons, there was little to no planned world PvP happening which, to me, is the most fun part of the game and was a real shame.
---
Reminds me of an ex. Damn, what's the origin of this picture? Asking for ehhh... A friend of mine.
---
You seem to like Horde so we might not what you are looking for but in any case I've created a guild for something very similar:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b7zzng/looking_for_group_monday_april_01_2019/ejxlx8l/
---
&gt; But has a smaller tool-kit for each role? Compared to non-hybrids?
---
Sorta. Pure DPS classes have three trees dedicated to DPS, so they have lots of potential specs that can do the core role. But no healing class has more than one dedicated healing tree. Resto druid isn't any different. Tanking is a little different, though, because the feral tree covers both the tanking skills and the feral DPS skills. They're still perfectly viable tanks, though.
---
&gt; So if i only want to heal, i'll better roll something else?
---
Not really. The four healing classes (priest, druid, paladin, shaman) just have different strengths. Priests are good all-around heals. Paladins are top single-target heals. Shaman are amazing AOE heals. Druids have tons of HoTs. 
---
I think part of the problem that people have with druid heals is that HoTs are trickier to do well. It's easier to work with direct heals in that it's easy to tell if someone needs a heal (e.g. if the target's health is low they need a heal, if it's high they are fine). But if you have several HoTs on a target and they start losing health, do you let it go and assume the HoTs will be enough or are they taking too much damage too quickly and need some other kind of intervention? Practice will help you answer that, but it's not as obvious as the other classes.
---
The post is very literally targeted at anyone planning on playing modern classic WoW.
---
Alliance scum.
---
You roll Druid for utility and versatility not output 
---
Honestly just join any guild ar the start because you will eventually have to join a raid guild with fitting raid hours
---
I agree but for having leveling multiple droods on vanilla pserv I just prefer to level them with good gear as it multiplies what you can do with a class that can offer so much.
---
For example, the last druid I leveled in the past few months has engineering maxed, full gear of the eagle (+intel/stam) with enchant  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=16768](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16768)  and a miner's pick with +55healing at lvl 20.
---
I ran an SFK as a healer and the tank was just a noob so I ended up tanking &amp; healing with 4 dps.
---
That's the kind of thing that push you to increase your skill and make me enjoy the game more than just a banal dungeon as a heal, tank or dps and it can't be done without proper gear unfortunately.
---
Plus I like to level as balance, do you already tried to lvl as a balance drood without good gear? It's a real pain \^\^ 
---
Their hots don't stack and are inefficient. They just use ht. Their strength is longevity.
---
I just leave it here (warning! Cataclysm footage!):
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy-vMKVY2RQ
---
P.S. I'm going to roll a feral druid and I don't care. I left my hardcore days behind me, now I just want to have fun. And I also mastered a skill of /ignore to inthinkable heights, so I guess it will help me a lot dealing with obnoxious minmaxers.
---
Retail has been stripping away every last drop of theorycrafting over the years and you think that's what ruined the game?
---
Removed gems, removed reforges, removed secondary stats weight, removed profession perks, removed talents, removed spells, removed sets, removed expertise, removed hit, now they've even removed any flavour to the items to the point where you just look at the ilvl and primary stat.
---
The game has only been dumbed down more and more with each expansion to cater to simple people, how can you even think that the "min/max mentality" has anything to do with that while it's the complete opposite... Blizzard did everything to repel the "min/max mentality" and in the process ruined their own franchise with easy difficulty, easy rotations and easy gearing to appeal to dumb tourists. 
---
Same here. 
---
My main is actually always  been a NElf Warrior, but I find Oxhorns Wow songs hilarious.
---
Mine is super short lived but leveling a hunter 1-10 you can click to auto shoot and take 1-2 steps back before he starts. This allows you to shoot a mob 3 times instead of 2 before it closes the distance, again short lived until you get your pet but helps with downtime eating.
---
Fun fact, for a very early trailer (I think E3), they faked all the battles, because the combat system wasn't even in place. So they scriptet "epic" autoattack battles and edited in special effects and sound effects afterwards. 
---
Prot pallies are viable (if you can stand rolling Alliance), but they suffer mostly from not having a taunt. They do dungeons perfectly well, but they don't do as much damage as other tanking classes, so they need a little longer to gather threat.
---
&gt; obnoxious minmaxers
---
How classy!
---
I can't keep making shit up as to why I can't book my leave right now... Please hurry up! 
---
If you got some good dungeon blue's and some pots/buffs it's doable if you pop all your cooldowns. But it sure ain't too fast and effective.
---
Join us bro. 
---
Come ahhnn
---
 ... Come ahhhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnn
---
Don't suppose you remember the title of the first song there, do you?
---
Following the former, try asking to prot paladins as well. The deathbone set is very coveted and the abundance of undead makes it ideal for them to tank.
---
I was a gnome.
---
Grinding dungeon is generally way more xp/hour than questing or grinding in the open world.
---
Most people run a dungeon once for the quest and another time or two if there is a piece of gear they really want.
---
In my experience, if you have a party of 5 with people knowing what they're doing and maximizing the dungeon speed run, it can be quite effective as you'll have no competition on mob and you'll all always have pretty good gear.
---
But it requires 5 peoples, good at the game, logged at the same time
---
This will probably upset a few people, but IMO blizzard should (and has made statements that point to this being the case) stop any sort of AAP type addons from working with classic. 
---
Never heard of a resto Druid having trouble getting into a good guild.
---
Right but besides the name, there's nothing from stopping people from RPing on a PvP server or best option Blizzard just calling a Server RP-PVP. Like besides typing what's stopping them?
---
i feel like stoneform is deeply underrated, as is escape artist
---
If post is on min-maxing, and you dont care to min-max, its safe to say its not targeted for you dont you think?
---
They have limited toolkits when it comes to dealing melee damage, tanking and caster damage. But as healers the opposite is true.
---
Resto Druids have more healing tools than for example Paladins and Shamans and they actually use more of their healing kit in raids than Priests. It is probably the highest skillcap healer in vanilla.
---
Probably the most important thing I've learned from tanking during leveling on Vanilla is you have to educate your DPS. 
---
Use marks on trash, make sure the order is clear (also for CC depending on group composition) and try to keep it smooth by only stopping if necessary. Learn to pull using your face and LOS, especially for casters. 
---
If someone overshoots on a target, just Taunt, it's fine. However if DPS think they can pull on their own or nuke right away, I've adapted the Ivan Drago mantra of "If he dies, he dies". I usually sit down and /cheer and wait for them to die, after that it's usually understood very quickly that I get to pull aggro first before DPS can start nuking.
---
yeah. a common build for druids to "do it all" has 1 point for nature's graphs. resto to nature switness then rest in feral.. this let's you heal, tank, dps, PVP and pve and tools for all of it without respeccing.. or of course you can do full feral but then you may want to go balance for omen of clarity, reduced shaoeshiff cost and +physical damage..
---
vanilla talent placement doesn't always make sense... 
---
I'm going to do skinning / leatherworking on my shaman. The leatherworking stuff is BOE, so you *could* get someone to make it for you. But I always like the idea of making my own gear, so LW feels best to me.
---
Herb/alchy is useful for money and consumables. Doesn't really appeal to me, but it is ... well, useful. Not exciting in my opinion, but useful.
---
If you want to make money, you can do skinning / herbalism while you level and just bank the leather you need to switch to leatherworking when you hit 60. That way you'll be able to get the mount and make your own gear to get started at 60. Not the way I prefer to play, but it's a practical approach.
---
You could even go mining / engineering. Lots of fun stuff in engineering.
---
Not really. Swiftmend/deep resto druids use HoTs regularly.
---
Oh I agree, I'm just curious why Blizzard is acting like it will be a lot of work on their part when it's really just a PVP server with the letters RP tacked on to the front. Again not like they will implement and enforce name restrictions, they don't even do that anymore for retail.
---
One of the driving forces behind Classic was a return to a more community-centric individual-server model of MMO. I'd like to hope for the sake of RP servers (and any future RPPvP servers) that they take a more serious stance on moderating this sort of stuff for Classic.
---
Freeze yourself!
---
Naming a server a RP server just so people can find eachother is a good thing imo. There are not many rp'ers and having them spread around at all normal pvp servers sucks for them. 
---
THIS is the reason.  Auction house is 90% of the economy and this was the only one.  
---
Exactly. For the enjoyment of the non-pserver players that will be starting up in the summer and playing for their first time, I think it's best that we don't make it so these things are a MUST like they were on pservers. The pserver crowd is so minmax and hard-core that in the first patches, if you didn't have devilsaur, you didn't have prebis, which meant you weren't allowed in their raid. Casual players can get easy alternatives that aren't that much worse and don't require them to farm a shit ton of gold just because some hard core players decided to monopolize one particular market. 
---
Really hope it’s disabled, bots ruin pvp and that’s the easier way for bots to work.
---
Again, nobody forces you to do anything and people try hard in the game because that's how they have fun. It's not so much that a competitive guild *demands* you to show up to raids in good gear, it's that you are in a competitive guild in the first place because you have that mindset and you invest time into gearing your character the best you can because that's how you have fun and that's how you want to play the game.
---
You're not gearing up, farming consumables and stacking worldbuffs because you're forced to, you're doing it for yourself, because you want to compete, beat your own DPS record, rank up in the leaderboard. You're not interest in that? Then don't. Nobody cares.
---
Enjoy your Classic experience the way you want and let others do the same. So many people on this subreddit try so hard to shame min/maxers like they're playing *the wrong way*. For goodness sake why does it matter so much to you how people enjoy themselves? I love making spreadsheets, I love farming dungeons and consums to be the best player I can and I love that my time investment is rewarded in vanilla. *Sorry* if that upset some people, somehow.
---
Oh, you have passion. I like you. While I'd like to say the LFG tool introduced with the release with ICC 5 mans was the downfall, it really started at the start of WotLK with the rehash of Naxx. Followed by Trial of the Crusader. The only good raid to come out of WotLK was Ulduar.
---
Heh, I remember when calling someone a "wrathbabby"was seen as an insult. Similar to noob. Good times.
---
Its fine, you do you boo, but this post contains good info for those who do care about it so why get all buthurt?
---
Unbreakabull
---
&gt; \- Back to Orgrimmar, you now wait for someone to turn in (from another or your guild) his Onyxia head. Thats right, if you ever get it you are not allowed to just get your free epic. You need to wait until the next raid so everyone gets the dragonslayer buff. Same procedure with the warchief buff from UBRS/Onyxia attunement  
---
When you have all these buffs, you group up with your guild in a safe zone then ride together as 40 people so you don't get ganked and lose the buffs on the way. 
---
Considering private servers have these set up wrong, very few guilds will get these buffs.
---
God, stop it already with devilsaur mafia! Cross-faction is against ToS since forever so it's really a pure pserv thing.
---
No, I'm not gonna link you the ToS. Find it yourself
---
Pserver hardcore minmaxers will continue to act like pserver hardcore minmaxers.
---
What my post above is arguing is that there will be plenty of non-pserver vets (or non-hardcore pserver vets) mixing into the community, which will change the dynamic, and the server populations will be smaller, which will change the dynamic.
---
Thinking Classic servers will all be replicas of pservers is foolish in my opinion. They might look very pserver-ish in the early days, but if they're still only attracting the pserver crowd a year later then we should all be very worried because Blizz isn't going to run these servers for a small number of people forever.
---
You didn't clear Naxx back then without being a tryhard, why vilify players cut from the same cloth now? They've had years to optimize some things and now they do things a bit different. 
---
Lok'tar ogar
---
storm earth and fire heed my call!
---
I've seen plenty of this kind in this sub (like a person telling that playing a gnome rogue is equal to disrespecting other people in a party, cause humans have better racials). That's why I choose "obnoxious".
---
I personally like to minmax and milk everything possible from a character (I just used to it after 7+ years of raiding on retail and can't play the other way). But I never ever shamed other people for their decisions (except when they are late for a raid and instead of apologizing say something like "It's just a game", this kind of attitude drive me nuts).
---
Hey man!
---
I read your guide from another subreddit! Tried to reach you on discord in the classic wow channel. I wanna talk!
---
Remember not to freeze yourself for 1000 years
---
&gt; The Devilsaur Mafia
---
This won't exist in classic as cross faction collaboration is forbidden and can be reported/banned for.
---
&gt; Ranking has become way more optimized
---
Most of that was already very common in retail vanilla and is nothing new. However straight up win-trading is again, reportable/bannable.
---
&gt; On raiding
---
Most of these optimizations are unecessairy for any content/raid. Will some people do it? Yes. But they are overkill for the easier T1/T2 raids and not required for AQ/Naxx, allthough very useful.
---
&gt; Goldfarming is also heavily optimized
---
Most of these things were regularly done in retail vanilla and none of them are particularly high income compared to the broad variety of possible gold farming methods.
---
dude he asekd for an oppinion if he should change the title or not. and thats my oppinion, it makes him sound like a toxic little kid. jesus this reddit is so annoying.
---
I'm not shaming anyone. The entire point of my first post was to try to point out that the private server crowd, and this subreddit's crowd, represents a fairly small segment of what will be the Classic playerbase. They represent the biggest fans, the most dedicated players.
---
All I was saying is that if you read this subreddit you end up getting the impression that if you're not a hardcore player you're going to be bottom of the barrel for all of Classic. This subreddit isn't a realistic sample of the entire population.
---
I'm not saying anyone is wrong, I'm saying this subreddit is demographically skewed and people should bear that in mind when trying to understand what the actual Classic server communities will look like.
---
Pservers diehard will be a minority of the playerbase, everyone else won't give a damn about the things you wrote.
---
Also for the mafia to work you need to collude with opposite faction, that's absolutely forbidden on official servers, at least PVP ones. Enjoy your bans.
---
Is there any greater feeling in wow than letting a tryhard get you low in wpvp only to bubble hearth at the last second? You can practically taste the salt through your screen.
---
Isn't that kind of an oxymoron though? Most feral druids farm their crowd pummelers and the ones that don't will hardly be considered to be taken to raids over the ones that do. Feral druids is the one specc that actually requires a lot of time investment and proper rotation to even remotely perform decently.
---
I'll be happy if the min/maxers all join the same guild and see how they do.
---
I'm sure individually they're great players but a guild only works when everyone gets along and there's little to no toxicity. 
---
The majority of the things mentioned in the OP are not at all new or invented by the pserver community and were already common in retail vanilla.
---
Well how did the 1st guilds then? 
---
BiS race
---
The post is literally trying to tell *everyone* that Classic servers will be crammed full of minmaxers and the only way to even be average is to nolife the fuck out of everything you do.
---
It's clearly aimed at everyone planning to play Classic.
---
Most of the PvP things mentioned were already very common in retail vanilla.
---
Gnomes rules. Or atleast make a female dwarf ! 
---
Uhh you sound way more like a "toxic little kid" than he does. And that's my opinion.
---
I mean just leave if you think people are annoying here. Unironically calling people "salty kiddo" isn't exactly contributing to a great enviroment, in addition to being pretty cringy when you're talking to people who are almost all adults.
---
&gt;If you have improved eyes of the beast, and make your pet go really far away from you, sometimes it bugs and it won't appear your name below them like "Legolas's Pet", if you name him with some rare mob name, you can really trick people thinking it's a real mob.
---
Ahhhh I saw that last night at Sun Rock Retreat. A hostile lvl59 boar called 'Whodatpig' running around the camp with no owner's tag. I was very confused, thanks for clearing that up!
---
#1 reason why i loved wow
---
It's not like hordes of people will keep spamming you with angry messages, to which you'll reply with a smug grin: "I don't care." 
---
The reality of the situation is that the only people who will care will be some guild leaders. Those people won't tell you how to play though, they simply won't approve your guild application.
---
noggenfogger turns you into a skeleton which is just the undead male animation set
---
The *old* set though, which didnt have the head turning animation at all.
---
Badge wellfare gear was the beginning of the end. The LFG tool was basically just the merciful deathrtroke finishing off the poor half dead thing bleeding out on the ground :p
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpDIEeJMLBI
---
By the same logic, all time spent ingame is a waste of time, which is arguably is. 
---
Few people talk about the benefits of wasting time doing things you enjoy that don’t necessarily benefit you materially. 
---
If this is an issue for you, you shouldn’t waste time playing video games unless you are really, really good at them and/or make money of items 
---
physical age doesnt say anything about social development of your brain.
---
I wasn't even an asshole. I may have taken it the wrong way, but I certainly wasn't rude. Way to set an example.
---
Art is a blast!
---
Gank them and camp them
---
I think his point was, as they talk about in the video, that they have no world buffs, a terrible composition, and overall not the best gameplay by todays standards, and they still killed KT.
---
It's just a response to the, mostly private server people, who think that you won't get into a raid group as a ret paladin, or that you need flasks to be competitive, or if you don't follow some excel sheet telling you which gear to use you're never gonna "beat" the game.
---
I just hope that there are enough leaders to represent the casual crowd when classic comes around. The pserver players are going to be the ones who are confident enough to start guilds straight away and I don't want them to suck the fun out of the game for casuals by normalizing the minmax stuff and making it their only option if they want to do end game content. I want there to be casual guild leaders who maybe don't mind having some weird specs in their raid, or people not having the absolute best pre bis, or having to get every buff you can get. Yes they will find the content harder but they will enjoy themselves a lot more. I'm pretty sure you're stating that there will be these kinds of leaders and I hope you're right because it will deal with a lot of the issues pservers have.
---
Isnt summer q3 :(
---
not only that but a lot of mats are wayyyyy easier to farm on Pservers.
---
for example my guild wanted to force everyone to use flasks for bwl even on farm (not only while in progression). each flask cost 150 gold.
---
then i learned that during wow vanilla one of the rare mats for the flasks had a 2 hours spawn time, while on Pserver it was 6 minutes.
---
Which means it will be inaccessible for most guilds, as farming those herbs would be impossible and buying them would cost like 10x more.
---
Progress on Pservers was also much easier due to all those small things. easier buffs, resistances worked wrong (1st time we killed rag at the start of the server our tank resisted the fire knock up 6 times), bosses have much less resistance and armor, a lot of encounters work differently than they used to in vanilla which allowed tactics that made them trivial.
---
I guess all in all this is a good thing as it won't be a day 1 faceroll for everyone, and only the top 1% will be able to clear raids on week 1 the rest will have to take their time.
---
The point isn’t that being a tryhard is bad, it’s when that spills over onto other people and ruin their experience (by giving them a false and twisted picture of what raiding is like) that it becomes bad. 
---
In other words, min/maxing = 👍🏻Shitting on other people for not min/maxing = 👎🏻
---
It's unrealistic because you have no control over your guild mates going and looking up the strategies that have existed for 15 years. The original guilds had no strategies to look up.
---
Even so, "kiddo" is an internet insult only because the physical age of the person is unknown. Like if you called me "kid" in real life you'd look beyond stupid, but on the internet it's fine because who knows if i'm 15 or 35, right?
---
If you want to say someone has the mindset of a child, then there's a word for that "childish". Calling someone kid makes it seem like you're projecting.
---
I see someone has already regressed to their 14 year old self dropping the “R word” again. Oh this man is ready to play wow classic again.
---
Sure, but I suppose if u commit in such a guild, ull respect the rules
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/77399195
---
A man of culture
---
&gt; ranking as i said. normal blizzlike pop servers work differently, there are maybe 2 premades at best from both sides. queues are longer. you either play or not play at all, cos you have no other enemies, thats how lower pop (blizzlike) servers pvp work.. Aswell as there can be crossserver bgs or not. or how it all gonna work.
---
Well I have to disagree. The PvP related things he mentioned were already common practice in retail vanilla.
---
You have to see that ranking to 14 isn't something anyone can do. You need to be extremely dedicated and basically no-life for an extended period to even be able to *think* about it. I'am talking PvP server here. I have heard reports from people playing on PvE servers that ranking there was way more relaxed and way less time consuming.
---
With that said, w/o a dedicated premade you won't crack anything above rank 8/10 or so on a reasonably active PvP server. And if you do have a premade then you'll have to wait your turn to get to rank 14 because it is an organised honor-farm based thing and not a real competition. So there is a lot of networking required for people to let you get the rank.
---
Then you won't be fighting fair matches depending on the server culture. You'll just dodge other premades most of the time. Maybe not in the begginning, because that is when people are still excited and don't really see the big grind ahead of them. But as people rank up and try to crack the highest ranks they *will* get impatient and burnt out as it was in retail vanilla, so you will dodge other premades and just farm PUGs, except if you have a high chance of winning a fast match against the premade. The ranking system is just heavily flawed and anti-competitive, so manage your expectations.
---
Yes, I know, I'm going to farm consumables and BIS and this Gnomeregan weapon (but in the very depth of my heart I hope that Blizzard will make the enchant permanent, hehe). That's fun for me. But healing as a druid for me isn't fun at all. If a raiding guild is going to accept me as a tank (offtank and probably MT in some encounters), that would be great; I enjoy being an offtank, this often requires more careful threat management and sometimes lots of movement. If not, I'm ok with it. They are going to miss a good and reliable player with 99% attendance, who's always calm and never insults others, so it's their loss xD
---
But if a person I meet in the wilds suddenly starts shaming me for being a feral, that's what I call "obnoxious". I've already experienced this kind of attitude in TBC, when I played a paladin, so I'm not going to tolerate it any longer.
---
Mages can blink inbetween small carcks in walls and doors, just have to position yourself properly. This works for example getting into the library in Dire Maul, there's a gap between the wall and door on the right hand side, position yourself correctly and you can blink through it meaning you can enter without having the key.
---
That’s correct, they’re not releasing the game now...
---
yes for most but not dire maul or mauradon ... that was brain death back in classic ... and having to go there too ... who goes to desolace 
---
From the WoW Wiki:  
---
* Patch 1.11.0 “Shadow of the Necropolis” Release date	June 19, 2006
---
* October 2, 2006: &lt;Impervious&gt; 8th US Kel'Thuzad Kill  
---
So... assuming you were even in Impervious back in the day. And assuming you linked the guilds first KT kill...  
---
This was the 8th KT kill in the US. Which you managed after more than 13 weeks of farming the earlier bosses in Naxx, not to mention the rest of the raids. No wonder you didn't need consumables with all that extra gear.
---
The "private server tryhards" I've heard talk about clearing Naxx, usually reference early Naxx progression and not progression with 3 months worth of extra gear. Mostly because the private servers tend to die off shortly after naxx comes out, mainly due to FRESH.  
---
Furthermore, claiming that you're not a tryhard yourself isn't genuine. Maybe you weren't a tryhard yourself, however, your guild also got the second Cthun kill in the US. Not tryhard? Please.  
---
I expected a trash argument from the title, thank you for obliging.
---
Meh, wasn’t in vanilla shouldn’t be in classic 
---
I'll admit, I'm kind of retarded. I thought that having a new skin would rejuvenate the game for me. My Warlock started as a Gnome and has been a Worgen, Orc, Troll and Dwarf over the years. I was a female Dwarf for the longest time until I spent the last of my b.net balance to turn into a male before BfA. Never again.
---
Will that work on the Legion client though?
---
Right, sorry, that was probably not your intention and I got a bit carried away. I'm tired of reading that pserv players and min/maxers "will ruin Classic" while in reality they couldn't care less how you play the game because in essence they'll probably stick to each other because they have high expectations.
---
I don't think any min/maxer is trying to dictate how people should play the game when they comment this or that is optimal, they're just giving an honest and realistic answer to a question asked on this subreddit. If you don't want to do this or that, then just don't, nobody is forcing you. It's merely an advice, not a personal attack.
---
Just have a read through the guild recruitment posts. Recruiting right now, on reddit/discord months before release puts you in the minority of the playerbase. Yet there are still plenty of guilds recruiting casual players. Guilds that are looking for other like-minded players who are maybe are older with less time on their hands than 13 years ago. I don't think the above will be much of a problem at all.
---
Back when I still played on pvp servers in tbc and wotlk i used to hang around lakeshire a lot
---
Ok we need some more news
---
Preach. I have a nice life, I just like to escape it in to WoW in my free time
---
did noggenfogger change at some point? i didnt know that
---
you’re trying to sound smart so bad, pretty cringe.
---
„Calling someone kid makes it seem like you're projecting.“  sure mate. what a pseudo-psychological conclusion. whatever, i‘m done talking to you, bye.
---
I did it in TBC, so it wasnt nearly as bad.  It takes about 750 of the repeatable quests in classic.  Disgustingly long but worth it, I think.
---
Me and my friend did the recruit a friend in tbc to get a warrior and priest duo for 60 twinking. Both rolled undead, our character names were Ihaveaids and igaveithim. 
---
Not very pc I know and probably against tos. Probably quite offensive too. I was clearly a bad person back then...
---
Needs more CRT
---
You might have to tone it down a bit. It will be OK. 
---
Female night elf hunters usually have Xiao in their names, at least on pservers.
---
Horde because my friends are all edgy boys. I'm Alliance at heart though. Has there ever been a sadder story in human history?
---
Are people really afraid that Blizzard would not put in an RP-PVP server at launch? 
---
i wouldnt be too worried about it. as long as your name is a little bit original and not some variation of tyrion or arthas im sure you will get it.
---
They basically cover all aspects of the game but specialize in none. So if you want to experience everything the game has to offer, then that is the server type that caters to you.
---
I was using private server auction house data to calculate the cost of the mats, so it could fluxuate, but essentially its the gold you would either spend, or lose by not selling the mats. Since im levelling with skinning mining, i wanted a general idea of how much gold id lose by hanging on to the mats vs selling them.
---
Bad example. If LFR didnt give any loot or gave heroic dungeon equivalent loot nobody would have a problem with it. Also sekiro is a purely single player game. Advocating against an easier mode is gatekeeping.
---
Oh, that's true too. Welfare PvP and badge gear in TBC. But wait ... Vanilla also has welfare epics near the end. Everyone had the welfare AV mount, welfare AV epics such as The Unstoppable Force. Hmm ...
---
Maan.. Its a real suffer for me too
---
There is no head turning animation, the mesh is just stretched and rotated.
---
no flask, no consumables...
---
Warrior
---
When fighting a hunter, when you see a frost trap, or anticipate one, you can taunt or mocking blow or commanding shout the hunters pet. This will cause the pet to attack you and break the trap.
---
what did u mean by Ironman challenge? 
---
       
---
not dying?    
---
not using addons?      
---
speed lvling?     
---
To be fair half the server is named Xiao something. They're everywhere. :D
---
If you want the name that badly be on at launch.
---
If you have turn undead as CC, might as well add locks to the list with fear
---
Shit. Your name is Banana too? 
---
It doesnt really matter though since , when you're doing real content , you would be instanced anyway
---
GJ, without any world buff ! When in private they are nearly all raiding with all the World buff available
---
Pserver, you asshole.
---
Ease it on down. Start playing, make some new friends, find a guild on your server.
---
Yeah I was planning on grinding out the rep to make nightfall for myself even, but the more I look at it, it'll probably be cheaper for me to guy pay someone to craft for me, because without guild support, farming that rep early on is going to crazy expensive me thinks.
---
&gt; 1 point for nature's graphs
---
but not at low levels while leveling. And... 5 points, to make it 100% chance, right?
---
I think all this shit will ruin the game for you. Original release did you think any of these thoughts? Didn’t all these worries, with none of today’s knowledge, handle themselves?
---
I raid with a rogue and ret pally.  The ret pally is the more engaging class.  Rogues are very mechanical, streamlined, and typicaly most fights go as planned.  Keep up snd and pop timely cooldowns.
---
After raiding with my ret, i feel more exhausted and fulfilled at the same time.  With rets, you are constantly watching procs for maximum vengeance uptime.  Every skill click has to be done in between auto swings, which forces you to be observant of your timers all the time.  Yes, you only havea seal, judgement, dispel, consecrate, and hammer of justice to cast, but clipping one auto attack could deny you a 1k dmg soc crit, so its very important.  Rets shine in emergency situations, and the thrill of landing a clutch bop or loh and saving the raid... is where rets shine imo.  Holy paladins are busy watching healthbars, whereas rets are more able to pinpoint areas of opportunity much faster than healers can.  Keep in mind, every fight is a battle to have enough mana sustain as well as ending the fight with 0 mana.  Also farming for raid consumables takes up more time than nonhybrid melee specs, so theres always something to do or prepare.  Rets are not that strong, but its unbelievable the number of players that think rets are just auto attack and afk
---
Hold up is this the dude on nostalrius saying he was best server but also the world
---
and in neither of these sources they explicitly say that wands doesnt get affected by quivers? They just throw and offhand remark wand doesnt get affected by anything/primary attributes
---
The lotus has a 1 hour spawn time in classic.  If they are farmed on spawn there is enough for 16.8 fully flasked raids per week on each server.  
---
So....yeah, not likely everyone will be flasked and if there is a real attempt for it the pricw will be out of control.
---
Back in bloodlust battlegroup I recall horde winning 80% of AV 
---
Asking 39 strangers to not look at strategies for a boss you've been wiping on for hours is a really big ask. It's literally impossible to know whether or not they're playing ball, it's purely based on trust. 
---
Honestly, the only people that don't look at strategies are the people figuring those strategies out. 
---
Shamans used to be able to stop falling by placing sentry totem. 
---
E.g. Jump off the edge at LM in AB and use sentry totem just before hitting the ground.
---
When you then clicked off sentry totem you would "restart" your fall from the totems locations.
---
Don't remember if they fixed this before they removed the totem, or even when they removed it.
---
I tanked 5-mans up to BRD no problem in vanilla as an enhancement shaman. I played on a low-med pop RP server and finding a proper tank was always a problem.
---
At 60 I rocked a 0/31/20 build that allowed me to pvp and grind as enh and be a semi-competent chainheal and WF totem bot in raids (I did MC, ZG, AQ20 and a little of BWL) and dungeons.
---
It was common for guilds to use world buffs and *some* of these consumables if they were still in the progression phase of Naxxramas, especially for a boss such as Loatheb, in which world buffs would be considered a requirement since it was basically a "gear-check encounter".
---
After a shit ton of wipes some of those 40 people are going to get frustrated and watch a guide.
---
Human warrior is an ultimate PvE choice.
---
Just as Retail has the whole range of guilds from full hardcore all the way down to non-raiding social guilds, and just as Vanilla WoW had the same range of guilds, I reckon Classic will be the same.
---
I expect the first few months of Classic to be all about the pserver crowd. Once Classic is established I think we'll start to see a lot more people returning: be it people who dropped out of WoW in WotLK or earlier and never returned to Retail, or people who are on Retail but who come over to try it out and find they prefer the pace and style of Classic over modern WoW.
---
If Classic is still dominated by the pserver crowd a year after release I don't think Blizz will keep it going, because I don't think *just* the pserver crowd represents enough people for Blizz to justify the investment.
---
&gt; a response to the, mostly private server people
---
I doubt anyone from that faction is being celebrated or positively reinforced on this board for insisting those things.  So, I feel like the title is just beating a dead horse and [yelling at the clouds](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/019/304/old.jpg), the villainous private server players, in a thread that will likely be an echo chamber of support. 
---
exactly that not every piece of gear has the best possible stat optimization is one of the things that make vanilla interesting
---
Remember - most end game input on this sub is filtered through a private server lens. Private servers are unique, filled with try-hard no-lifers (not that that’s necessarily a bad thing) who want to clear BWL in 45 minutes. How many guilds, in the world, were like this in Vanilla?
---
If you don’t play the class you want to play you’re going to be unhappy regardless.
---
I'm not looking to be the too dps, but I want to add value.  Like on my druid, I would log on and I'd start getting whispers to tank this, run flags, and alot of can you heal this and that.   
---
I just don't want to heal full time.  :(
---
Yep, watched it again lately because hype, but taken out of the historical context that was the WoW phenomenon, it's just not a good episode.

There use to be a way to cliff jump skyrim style into Hyjal.  In Hyjal there is a huge well that goes a LOONG way down.  As a warlock, I brought a couple buddies there and gave us all underwater breathing.  The unsuspecting guildies we summoned were not so lucky...
---
They're probably going to have Battlegroups: they were added in 1.12 and so far 1.12 seems to be the base they want to progress from. There's been a PvE content phase plan released but not a PvP one, but I'd be surprised if Battlegroups weren't a core part of it. 
---
These "facts" are well known by the community that cares, and will have no implications whatsoever on people who have not played for 10 years, which will be the majority. Saying " you and your mother will be ganked by the devilsaur mafia day and night" or "you need to log in 2 hours prior to raiding just to sniff at flowers" is only meant to scare people who don't know any better. I don't think it's productive.
---
my plan will be stacking of the wolf on any melee spec i level in classic, fight me
---
it really depends on your playstyle.. a lot of builds only have 1 point in it for utility even though it's not 100% chance.  You probably don't need it for pve low levels but it helps in PVP if someone tries to gank you, you can root them and run or keep a mob off of you.. really depends.. where you are playing now do you have a lot of people around you or is it mostly empty?  Because that would determine too on classic if people will be able to assist and heal or watch you're back during PVP
---
Druid was my class when I played in vanilla, I will roll Druid again. Played as resto in raids back in the days. Love the option to use different forms and play different roles in a single class. 
---
&gt;all white gear, no talents, no potions, no buffs
---
I have **no** idea why anyone would want to do this, but godspeed, you sick bastards.
---
It will be hard enough without the restrictions. I don’t think there is much interest in such things.
---
Hi there! I’d be super interested to join. I originally started playing WoW just before BC so although I’m familiar with some Vanilla raids I never had the chance to do them properly. I stopped playing retail back in November but really really looking forward to getting that old feeling back with Classic.
---
I generally tend to play Paladin, Warlock, Druid, Priest, so a mix of DPS and Healing. I haven’t decided on what I want to roll for Classic but likely to be some of those. I’m likely to be playing with my husband, who was a raid leader back in BC as a tank or DPS.
---
We’re both in our early 30s, live in the UK, and looking for a guild with a casual but curious and fun approach, with some raiding included after people hit 60. Hope It sounds like a good fit!
---
You'd better believe I'm creating 4 characters with sick names at 00:01 (assuming the servers don't crash).
---
I believe cross faction collab rules only cover world bosses, but what do I know, I'm just a WoW lawyer.
---
I mean in raiding currently we use two dualwield defiance tanks and then me bitch tank aka impale. But it's really nice but the two other tanks require a ton of extra healing. 
---
Legit a strat I've used before. Never hurts to ask!
---
Min-maxing character select screen...
---
This is so extra I almost want to think you’re trolling.
---
You are .01% of the Original population and none of the shit you’re saying is necessary.
---
This is the stuff that scares people interested in having fun casually gameplay into never playing again.
---
This will be handy in STV. Thanks dude. 
---
I did my first raid on my druid at lvl 58, didn't even know what a raid was, I was even feral at the time.   They gave me 100g to respec and they summoned me in.
---
Was not hard at all to get into raiding lol
---
Weird, feels like every March I'm playing the new best game I've ever played. Horizon/botw &gt; God of war &gt; sekiro 
---
There are thousands of players like you.  Yes you will find a guild.  No it will not be easy.  Yes you will raid.  Yes, you have to put in effort.  Yes, yoh will still need a poop sock.
---
Ony/zg/songflower buffs literally take like 15min. They save a ton of time
---
Check out Stormx or Ebbnflow on YouTube 
---
I mean I agree with whole heartedly but the sad truth is a lot of tanks are willing to put the full blame on anyone but themselves. I posted this yesterday after our 2nd tank was having some attitude and blaming the healers again. It's mainly because I am sick of seeing tanks with this mentality.
---
He was a meme on /vg/ where this pic originates from. Used to post webms of his pvp in every thread and was generally mocked for being an autistic NEET
---
Honestly if a warrior pulled that off against me I wouldn't even be mad. That's next level tactics!
---
You're good!
---
That would be too complicated, and the lower pop cap servers would wind up dead. Not to mention that Blizzard is going above and beyond to keep a vanilla feeling, and server pops over 3.5k would be way too far from a vanilla feeling. The exception will be at launch, when server caps are temporarily raised and sharding introduced in the start zones to handle the influx of looky-loos that Classic will have for the first few weeks.
---
They will 100% fix that in classic so don't worry about it
---
Sounds like you just need to play on a different timezone, really. 
---
They will also notice that you don´t find players left and right to raid engame content. You have to take what you get at some point. 
---
Oof stairs boss ks real I love the ledge tankers with mobs below you and then the dumbass dps runs up and pulls everything below chaining the whole fucking dungeon lol
---
*Wooo* It's your **8th Cakeday** Dingobloo! ^(hug)
---
If I could only be so lucky
---
Is afternoon play viable for you?  Could you roll on an EU realm?
---
EU realms are 5-6 hours ahead of NA east coast, so a 7pm-10pm raid in EU would be something like 1/2pm - 4/5pm on your time.
---
&gt;world first will be a mage
---
If they can break ahead far enough to do aoe grinding uncontested then there's a good chance of it, but on every server so far it hasn't been managed successfully.
---
Yeah I'm not looking for some level 58 MC though
---
If he dies he dies. The longer I tank dungeons in vanilla this is over my 4 or 5 years of experience. I will now let them tank it if they want it they can have it.
---
First off pservers have Ironfoe set at a 4% proc rate, not 15% that you made up to push your exagerated argument. HoJ is 2% and it's accurate because the tooltip itself reads 2%.
---
Even if those proc rates are inaccurate - some are likely off by a very small amount, some are probably right - at the end of the day these are still niche, very rare items that very few people rely on and they wouldn't change the meta one bit even if you completely removed the item from the game.
---
It amazes me how many people try to convince themselves that private servers are absurdly inaccurate while 99% of the values are correct and sourced and think they're going to reinvent the wheel on Classic.
---
Dude retail is so toxic i just want classic wow to not be.
---
[Heres the old ToS](https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8) what remains to be seen is whether it will be the same in classic, the revised ToS has no such rule.
---
Bit oot here but I recently started mage aoe grinding and it's really fun and fast. So far I got to the murlocs in dustwallow marsh and can get 60k+ exp/h there, the yetis in hillsbrad were ~45k exp/h, the farms there were 25-35k exp/h. Since you seem to know a lot about it I wonder, do you know good exp/h rates for the different locations or is there some community that discusses this?
---
Oh Yeah I've done that plenty of times to my buddies.
---
I mean the max level potions because major mana pots are expensive.
---
Yeah agreed.
---
Rogues aren't normally the problem though its ranged dps mainly.
---
They were a totally geared raid.   Just were missing heals.  All I'm saying is, if Druids weren't desired, why would they bring an undergeared, under lvl druid?
---
As a tank, i often want to view around (with left mouse button) without changing the my line of sight to strafe or backpedal.
---
I use backpedaling sometimes when tanking, since it's essential that the enemy is in front of you for mitigation mechanics. Yes, you can kinda "cross sail" this, but i personally don't like it. Maybe I'm just too clumsy however;P There's enogh keybinds for me, with ctrl, shift, alt combinations more so.
---
 Also: If anyone is short of keybinds: I played on RDFG for years, some more easy to reach keybinds on the left side.
---
Would've been cool as a Mage only place. Was super disappointed with all the neutral cities hippy shit.
---
The $80 amazon suggested monitor on amazon is nice, and glare resistant! As for a chair I just hit my local Walmart and add a pillow for back support. A desk you can easily get on Craigslist or some site like that for super cheap. I currently use a 6 ft table (the ones they use for garage sales and stuff) because my wife games with me and it’s perfect 
---
The build with that cash and be great as well. Pcpartpicker.com is fantastic for you as well. Plenty of budget builds you can tweak and play with for the ultimate build made just for you. 
---
Does anyone remember going to the Hinterlands back in the day?
---
Honestly, for me it was a fairly forgettable zone. But these experiences really stuck out. Lemme know what you think, and what you remember from this foresty zone! \^\_\^
---
It's not like people insist on it, it's just in the general culture of the game now, and a lot of people don't like that. It's not that people say "you literally cant raid as ret", it's the idea that "well ret does 392 dps unbuffed in MC and that's not optimal so you're gonna need to get x y and z world buff and also i wouldn't want you in my world first Rag kill group".
---
Whether you agree with it or, it's bringing a post-vanilla mindset to vanilla, and it's something that wasn't there 14 years ago. Of course it's in some way inevitable, but a lot of people miss the "anything goes" attitude of vanilla, and are afraid it'll be out-exceled and theorycrafted away.
---
I mean i'm a private server player, the reason he talks about private server players in particular is because they're the ones actually playing the game in 2019. When the game releases a lot more people will adapt the "tryhard" attitude.
---
Jokes on you, that's my fetish.
---
That would be quite the surprise indeed. Hopefully we'll get a beta before Classic to make sure how it's supposed to work.
---
Any meme spec can do MC. I'm talking about proper non pluggable raids. I've done MC on various characters and seen all sorts of specs in there
---
It's more about the typical edgy and big ego players, the "1v1 me solo mid" kind like your typical Invoker imo
---
Just raid with us Aussies. There's bound to be tons of us wanting to raid at hours like you mention. 
---
Is there an all-in-one build for druids so to speak? I’d like to be able to tank some dungeons leveling, heal in raiding, and be a flag carrier in PvP. 
---
Yeah, I'm not with the people who don't want all the graphical/cosmetic improvements that have been added over the years. There are a lot of them so I hope they get that option to keep them happy, but I don't share their nostalgia for 2004 graphics.
---
I will tell you the most OP 2 key combo in the game!
---
1. Bubble
---
2. Hearth
---
I know this sounds amazing, but its true!
---
Alliance! Every time I try leveling a Horde toon I get bored. Plus Horde doesn't have Ironforge :3 
---
Hahah yeah my apartment is super tiny and share it with my gf. I have a small old school tiny desk but don’t have a ton of room on it but maybe I can install some shelves above it to give me some extra storage space. 
---
I need to get more familiar with pcpartpicker and start tracking the price, I probably want to start the build in June so that I’m ready for world of Warcraft classic and have a working computer ready to rock!
---
Going alliance just because I’ve always mained horde and want to try something different
---
yep, Blizzard is great at keeping quiet to avoid trapping themselves with deadlines or promises they can't deliver on. I wouldn't be surprised if they were only announcing things as they were finished/at the very least determined possible.
---
In theory yes, because blink is basically a position swap based on a straight-line trajectory. The hard part is lining it up perfectly.
---
Thanks for the tips! I've been reading some tips and tricks on how to be fulfill the role as a tank. Appreciate the rage input.  
---
desolace is a good 32-34 zone. decent amount of quests and lots of good grinding spots
---
*Dances in Moonkin*
---
NA is the only country that exists.
---
That's absolutely true. They have no choice but to learn. 
---
If you can go from wherever you are to onyxias lair, kill her, go to felwood and find a songflower (which can't be shared btw), back to orgrimmar/stormwind and to silithus in 15 minutes I'm very impressed.
---
Devilsaur mafia won’t sheep your mobs they’ll just right click report to boot you out of game.
---
Welcome to the -cool- side of the pillow!
---
Usually I read the opposite, that priests use most of their kit, while druid is relegated to spamming healing touch - unless he's designated to also throw rejuv and regrowth on the tank.
---
Assuming I'm not the designated tank healer, what would healing with a druid look like in a raid?
---
That’s a good point.  Communication can solve a lot of issues. Not everyone uses ktm in a pug, so I tend to use my standard list first and work from there.
---
Racing to reserve a specific character name tomorrow, or racing to get a specific character name at launch day.  
---
What's the difference?..
---
I've never said I wasn't a tryhard poopsocker back in the day. 
---
Hey, detective, can you find Jhasa for me and say Kenkoy said hi?
---
We had 3 resto Druids in naxx.  Cleared spider and plague wings, got to thaddius and 4 Horsemen and never downed them though.   I don't blame the resto Druids tho.  We just ran out of time before BC.   
---
Sure I wasn't world first, but you won't be either.  No matter what class.
---
Looks like imgur or my Reddit app downscaled it. I’ll try and send it from my computer when I get the chance. 
---
The problem is if people RP on a PVP server, they usually end up getting trolled by people who just don't have the time/mindset for PR, which ultimately ruins the experience for them.
---
It's still in griefing part wich an hypothetical devilsaur mafia would be. It's only possible on pserv due to lack of moderation 
---
Telling me what I want to hear.
---
I know quite a bit about shaman tanking, if you'll allow me I'd love to elaborate on Shaman Tanking as a whole. I usually hang with other players in the wow classic discord voice channel.
---
Possible July 16th based on some interesting "clues" from Blizzard.
---

You have no idea. I’ve never been this obsessed or fixated on something as simple as a development update or game release date in my life before.

Priest pws a warrior to piss off them/group. Chuckle to yourself

Man people love shitposts here. I wonder what sort of responses he expected.

Sure, I am in the classic wow discord voice channel.
---
I played so much vanilla on privat servers the past 5 years, but i'm still hyped as you for the release
---
Been playing the BFA storyline with ConsolePort (controller support),  Dynamic/ActionCam (over the shoulder view), Immersion (more immersive chat UI), and ElvUI (hide most UI). 
---
It's not Classic, but it's actually pretty interesting and a nice change of pace.

I'm playing alliance so I don't need to push my ego by killing lowhp players, that's a thing for hordescum. However, if the enemy players name is "getrektcuck" or something in that direction I'll gank them because I know for sure they wouldn't hesitate either. 
---
0wn 1337 style
---
Its not lol, where do you get this info from? There are like 2 complete alliance guides out there and they are honestly both shit. I would pay few dollars any time for a well detailed guide that you can be sure that is good. If you used this logic everywhere, you'd be walking around country side picking up berries and killing animals just so you dont have to pay for food. You trade the money for time efficiency.
---
No because classic is 1.12
---
RP-PVP servers are just PVP servers with RP rules. A role player typically wouldn't roll on a PVP server for the same reason he wouldn't role on a PVE server. RP and RPPVP servers are a gathering place for like minded players.
---
As someone who has played on an EU RPPVP server since 2006, I can kinda understand blizzards choice here. Until Cata the server was nice and big. It was by far the best server I've ever played on. The community and experience was second to none. 
---
After Cata it started to dwindle a bit. Eventually it was taken over by PVP as WPVP guilds who didn't care about RP in the slightest. Now all of the RPers have transferred to the RP-PVE servers (where they still have AMAZING WPVP events) and all the RPPVP servers on eu ended up merging together...but that didn't help. The server still feels dead.
---
I'm not Blizzard and I don't know stats so this is probably BS and you'll have to take it with a rather large pinch of salt, but I'm assuming that there will be a steep drop off of players who decide classic isn't for them after a few months. The opposite may happen, sure, but I don't know. My guess is that blizzard want to b very careful and specific about how many servers they release at launch. We don't know the caps yet, but I'd imagine it's easier to add more servers to meet demand than it is to merge servers that are spread too thin.  If numbers to begin to drop, server population will stat to dwindle; especially on the quieter servers, like an RPPVP server, which in the grand scheme of things, caters to a relatively small, niche audience (just because a lot of people here and on another forum are passionate about RPPVP doesn't mean the playerbase in general is). I would hate to roll on an RPPVP server only for it to die after 9 months, while PVP and RP servers are still flourishing.
---
With that in mind, I'd be happy just to roll on a well populated PVP server and RP there with like minded folk. I personally don't believe having RPPVP servers are a good idea, though I'll happily see myself proven wrong on this. 
---
wtf u talking about?
---
I convinced a hunter to name his pet after me one raid, then gave myself the night off of healing. When caught by the raid lead and asked who I had zero output, I pointed to the cat and said "Must be the pet bugging the meters" and went back to whatever else I was doing. I won three pieces of gear that night.
---
That's what I thought. So there is gonna be a point when OP is grinding mobs and receiving no XP
---
I KNEW THAT SOUTH PARK EPISODE WAS FULL OF SHIT TOO BTW, NO WAY THOSE GUYS WENT 1-60 ON THOSE BOARS
---
That feels like forever away T-T 
---
The Witcher, Spiderman, Uncharted, Red Dead Redemption, Resident Evil 2, Fallout 76, God of War (One of these is not like the others).
---
Druids have a serious stacking problem since HoTs don’t stack.  If you want to stand out as a druid then you need the most +healing and spec rejuvenate/regrowth otherwise you’ll be spamming downranked HT.  In certain fights it’s hard for one druid to maintain hots on all ranks so you can have multiple druids with HoTs.  A druid can sustain you 1-2 tanks with minimal effort.  So fights with 3+ tanks can use multiple druids effectively.
---
Unfortunately aoe healing is often sniped by Paladins and shamans so rejuv on the raid is rarely effective.
---
One thing to note is that EVERY class has some amount of narrowed role in raids.  Druids are much more interesting healers in 5/10 mans where you can HoT everything efficiently and it won’t get sniped.
---
I hope this post gets more upvotes and visibility for blizz. There are several people who want to see unfinished content completed in Classic WoW. We know Blizz is watching, hopefully they'll get the message.
---
I'm ok also getting all the unfinished content post-launch as a sort of expansion.
---
You roll what you want.   I'm just telling you my experience, 14 years ago.
---
I take everything that comes from private servers not too seriously.   Sure they've been playing "vanilla" longer than I did.   But they are playing with made up numbers, just keep that in mind.
---
I believe you could throw water walk on a teammate, have them jump off a bridge and throw that on them. Watch them die when they hit the water
---
Priests are using mostly different ranks of GH in raids which is their most efficient healing spell. Their other healing spells are very situational from my experience but see more use in 5mans and PvP.
---
Druids use either HT if Moonglow specced or their HT + both HoTs + Swiftmend if deep resto. Your assumption is correct that you don't want too many Swiftmend druids in a raid because HoTs do not stack. So an optimal setup would be to have a Swiftmend Druid and then the rest into Moonglow.
---
If you have time/will, please make a post listing all the unfinished/planned content you know or you can find around the internet. Now we know Blizz is watching and this is our chance to make our voice heard.
---
Having all this extra content which was meant for Vanilla added would make Classic the definitive experience and a chance for all the original Vanilla developers to see their vision of the game fulfilled.
---
That would be absolutely awesome.
---
I thought I was the only one.
---
*Cries in alliance*

My father uses a terrible mouse only system, and when he needs to scoot backwards he just taps the down arrow button a few times, hurts to watch but it let him keybind every skill...

---
There is room for a bit of tweaking in the feral tree, especially if youd rather tank, but overall i think this is solid.
---
\*breathes heavily\*
---
Its mostly for tank healing 
---
Sorry I misunderstood you, English is not my first language either ;-)
---
They just need a good guild leader that doesn’t take any bullshit, and leads by example.
---
Sheep - moon, triangle  - trap, star or diamond - sap. Seemed to be how my servers did it. Will be fun to see the marking meta :P
---
While I agree that theorycrafting for Pservers is mostly for progression and not farm/late stage geared composition I think the post was intended to keep people from assuming raiding wasn't possible without BiS everything. The problem is people who never had a chance to play vanilla or never went fast enough to get heaps of raiding experience before servers were killed by F R E S H might be getting the idea that you can ONLY raid if you take the time to go 100% BiS as that might take away from their personal play style or fun.
---
I see enough comments about "good luck ever getting in a raid" when people are attached to certain specs or races. Hopefully posts like this can slide that over to "good luck with a slower progression raid" to at least let people know they can get it done either way just further down the road.
---
I also feel like the private server raid exclusion has been blown out of proportion. It might be that way the first few months when everyone is going hard but after a while it tapers off and you can get in a raid no matter your spec/race because people end up looking to fill the last 8 or so slots with any warm body that can throw out more than 0 DPS and only die half of the time in fire.
---
So maybe we can all dial back a bit on the salt and try to generate a more welcoming picture to "end game" content for WoW:classic so as not to scare off the newbies?
---
wE aRe So EnTiTiEd On ThIs SuB!
---
Yeah but those are the minority and very rare in the actual game outside of jokes and the like. In the actual game people don't care about your race choice except you.
---
I mean for example one of the best main tanks in retail vanilla was a Tauren Warrior, even though Troll is the best choice from a min-max perspective.
---
Most of the Horde Rogues are Undead, even in hardcore guilds, allthough both Troll and Orc have better melee stats and DPS racials.
---
The list goes on and on. People simply don't care outside of forum trolls and a few assholes.
---
they generally come out around 11 am CST... so about 4 hours from now
---
I say higher fences on horde side! Make AV Great Again
---
In TBC I can remember winning alot of AV on horde with that PremadeAV addon . It took a premade and coordination to get that win rate to about 70%. 
---
Premade vs Premade tho Alliance won 60/40 because of the bridge. Even in a base rush format a few alliance on defense is enough to slow down the captain despawns to give alliance the edge...
---
meanwhile alliance offense just jumping over our fences like 'MERICA
---
He's wearing the gloves. 😭
---
It’s a challenge. That’s why. 
---
Go Gnomish and have a friend or guildie to make u the goblin sapper charges.
---
There is just probably not a whole discord to it. 
---
HOTW spec. Either the one linked below or 30/21. Will need lots of different gear though.
---
So, here I made a simplified Race/Class picking guide for everyone who's getting confused by all the choices out there. Hope you enjoy! \^\_\^
---
oh f\*ck! you reminded me of that dungeon ... the 2018 versions are much shorter than the real thing ... and getting the UBRS key .... fml 
---
What's the point of this thread then, mr poopsocker?
---
RP servers are Normal PvE servers where you have to flag your self for PvP.
---
RP-PvP servers are PvP servers with PvP enabled at all times in contested areas.
---
RP just add some extra rules and attracts a lot of RP players, which makes the game so much more fun!
---
You don't have to heal full time. You can respec. And as explained above Enh Shamans are fine for raids too. The difficulty is really the gearing IMO.
---
Picking up a concrete block using a hook pierced through my nipple would also be a challenge, doesn't mean you'd wanna do it.
---
But like I said, godspeed to these nutters.       :\_:7
---
As a druid you can hide your transform with Nogger elixir or other toy buffs (like becoming a pirate with food). Useful in pvp.
---
My experience the few times I had issue with people for loot trading in retail was that they the kind of person who "accidentally" ninjas stuff is more likely to slap you with the item than give it to you (metaphorically) 
---
&gt; walking into a GM or a HW to me would just induce pity. 
---
Walking into Wow gamers that have spent days, months, years  for some , play time just for a virtual game induce pity in a lot of people too.
---
Welcome to the club :p
---
(for the record I can't recall what max rank I ever achieved in Vanilla but it wasn't much more than the one were you get the trinket)
---
Well it is as much of a challenge as you make it.  Getting to 60 by killing only greens/green quests would be pretty easy even with nothing as long as you are a mage/lock/priest/hunter.  Could be pretty brutal as a warrior or rogue though.
---
This has been discussed a million trillion times already, use the search bar.
---
I know a few people who attempted it in Classic and TBC, seemed like a nightmare and I only recall one or two actually doing it.  
---
The most impressive of course was Gutrot, the Troll Warrior who levelled naked and with no weapons.   
---
[https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/16802-gutrot-lvl70302-the-end-of-the-road/](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/16802-gutrot-lvl70302-the-end-of-the-road/)
---
My personal favorite rogue trick is pretty simple. Get 5 points on someone, preferably leather or clothie..blind them (but make sure they already used pvp trink) and while they're blinded, perform a 5 point expose armor on them and immediately turn opposite direction from them to prevent an auto swing from breaking the blind.
---
After you successfully exposed them without auto swinging, leave combat and restealth and sap them...regen energy to full and now you have an opportunity to open on someone with full energy and probably 0 armor. Nuke time!
---
The funny thing is only those who never actually did it are the ones with that argument. I got through C’thun before quitting the game briefly and coming back to focus on PvP, no one was really a min/maxer to the extent it’s been portrayed. Sure during progression it would be nice to have that flask but you’d never be fully expected to get them, only encouraged (unless you were MT but in my experience most MT’s have also been the GM so they want to set an example.)
---
Someone would already have the ony head and saved it for the guild turnin, since this is for farm anyways ofc. 
---
Mage portals will also be used to teleport the raid, not fly from one end of the continent to the other
---
Songflower q turnin cant be shared yes. But the purified plant can give its buff to all, provided you all click it around the same time, this also worked in vanilla.
---
Thank you for posting this, really brought back great memories as I played a NE priest back in the day.
---
I remember frantically casting "Shackle Undead" on those bigass spiders inbetween every single heal when KT went from 10% to 0%.. that image will never fade in my memory, it was so exciting :)
---
I can't remember having that many addons when we played tho, I barely had emergency monitor and deadly bossmods.. I did however bring 100+ Major Manapots for every single raid, which I farmed on my rogue every day after coming home from school till raidinvites started.
---
Anyone here who can help me find videos of my old guild? or hell even members from the old classic days?
---
We were a guild called "Decimation" on EU-Talnivarr, cleared KT on September 25th in 2006, 7th or 8th in the world iirc. PM me if you find any please, would highly appreciate it :)
---
I JUST WANT TO PLAY VANILLA THANKS!
---
1:30 That moonfire battle with other druid :D 
---
Most moose in Norway, shit themselves if you just say anything to it. Several of them has almost ran me over only because they  didn't notice me. Say anything to it and it will do an instant 180 turn. Pretending to be dead is extremely dumb, since the moose might just walk right over you.
---
T too much hopefully.hey work on private servers just fine probably.  Most of those guilds will probably keep the same playerbase and move to classic as a whole so they won't mix
---
I forgot to tedious getting to dungeons was in vanilla.
---
Make an RP-PVP server blizz! Maybe like 2 per continent ...
---
I don't think you should choose a class just for that, just find an addon that either reminds you when the ability is up or you could add the most important one on a mini bar near your char.
---
It's what I did in Vanilla with my warrior : I had a mini bar with mortal strike, execute and intercept just under my char so I could instantly know when they were up.
---
If you practice strafing between auto shots (aka kiting) you can kill most mobs without them ever touching you. Add in concussive shot at level 4 and most mobs will never get to you. Just start as far back as you can, shoot, strafe until your auto shot is just about ready (you'll get the timing quickly if you are paying attention,) then stop to shoot and as soon as you do immediately start strafing again. I save shots and stings for shots on the move so I only have to stop for an auto attack.
---
Practicing this early on helps a lot. I see so many hunters taking hits to the face at level 1-10 then stopping and eating food. As a hunter you should never get hit, even without a pet. When you get really good you can kite several mobs at a time.
---
A huge trick to this is observing the land and knowing what terrain mobs wont go over and exploiting that, like jumping off a ledge forcing the mobs to take the long way around.
---
Good guides for tanking and healing as a druid in Vanilla (raids and dungeons)?
---
I appreciate the nice write up, and thoughtful content.  However, the title should read **"A list of things that you need to be prepared for on a non-sanctioned private server."**  While a few of these points hold true, things like the devilsaur mafia are against the TOS and will be highly regulated by Blizzard.  As vigilant as Blizz has been about the forums/understanding what vanilla was, and why there are private servers, they will have a plan to prevent things like this from happening.  
---
Learn to spell "lose", you fucking degenerate.
---
Don't forget his first multiplayer experience: Oddjob in Goldeye. 
---
UD rogue was my alt. Shaman was my main. Was not edgy teen. (Not saying there weren’t plenty of them)
---
When classic drops I’m rolling Alliance for new (to me) content. But I like hybrids so I’m rolling a Druid tank. And a good friend of mine is rolling Druid heals so we can level together. Also he can put a few points into feral and we can stealth run things. 
---
Imagine if the Diablo Mobile Blizzcon rep shows up July 16th and says that release date was an out of season April Fools Joke
---
Extending the hunter fun, I remember going to the horde starting zone, taming a boar, turn on PvP, hide behind a tree and use the control pet ability. I then did my best to mimic a real boar. Players would tag it, their PvP would toggle and I'd kill them.
---
Only something I did once but it's fun because it worked.
---
Forgive my lack of knowledge but when was it super overpowered? :o
---
I do to, but I rebind back walk to a different key. Down arrow is a good one I think. Then if you need it you have it
---
It actually fits because Vanilla was constantly being tweaked and updated after every patch.  Adding a patch 1.13 + would keep that trend going post Naxx. 
---
lol I remember a few alliance hunters doing this outside Org a couple times xD Always got someone too
---
Is it 1hour? I remember reading blizzard saying 2 hours. But yea exactly. 
---
Currently on Pservers it is much more convenient in very small and subtle ways which make it easier without you notocing it.
---
In this episode, I tell the story of my first alt and how she came to be a night elf warrior in Elwynn Forest. What was your first alt, everyone?
---
If you’re talking about horizon Zero Dawn, then yes that was recently my new favorite game of all time, on consoles at least 
---
I could see world buffs before farm night(not progression) being possible in classic IF you are reliably able to do the head turnin(not locked out by the vanilla timer).  If you get locked out of the turn in fairly frequently nobody is going to bother.
---
Is anyone really saying you NEED to min/max? Why can't people play the way they want to?
---
&gt; Thought it was pretty neat when i started playing guild wars 2 and that has it
---
Yeah, I made the bad choice of making my Necro a petite, and now when she's talking to a Norn she's trying to break her own neck...
---
That'll be hours and hours of progress good luck and godspeed
---
Bit niche to advertise extreme off-hour raiding guilds 4 months before launch, no? 
---
Latency is the only issue, but otherwise this. 
---
I can not for the life of me understand the draw of those games. The newer ones even seem like worse versions of pubg but somehow they’re vastly more popular.
---
People may try it, but blizz will stop it.  Organized cross faction collaboration is against the TOS.  Also, griefing another player in the way described (a mage chain sheeping the devilsaur so you can't kill it) is reportable/bannable (after a pattern of behavior is established for that player).  
---
He's making a rare and valid counter-point to the much more common perceptions that private server speedrunners are quite vocal about. There's real merit to not scaring off new potential raiders.
---
The only one that looks like a salty kiddo is you.
---
&gt; I see enough comments about "good luck ever getting in a raid" when people are attached to certain specs or races. Hopefully posts like this can slide that over to "good luck with a slower progression raid" to at least let people know they can get it done either way just further down the road.
---
Posts like these? A video link showing a KT kill in Vanilla? With no description and a garbage title?  
---
How is this post doing anything other than showing a KT kill video that has been posted a bunch of times before?
---
How so? They're not demanding guilds or groups accept them, they're willing to put some effort in to make bear tanking work, they're just not gonna tolerate people randomly being arsey about their playstyle.
---
You'll be dead if you try to go to stv
---
Paladin
---
Yes. [Shadra](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Shadra) is one that comes immediately to mind.
---
Depends how you want to play, if you have really shitty build and don't give a shit about your gear then you're just basically just dead weight to others. 
---
It's not always about you, it's also about benefiting others.
---
This sort of thing is why I miss vanilla. The forums back then were as much fun as the game.
---
My first character was a protection warrior. I was a tank for most of the vanilla raids. I absolutely loved tanking those raids but 15 years later I don't have that kind of time to commit anymore and I'm kind of sad about that. Mage maybe?
---
Hunter warlocks!
---
Then wtf is the point of the thread?
---
You'll be able to find a guild and latency isn't that bad the game was made to be played at 300 ms
---
What you wrote:
---
&gt; dude he asekd for an oppinion if he should change the title or not. and thats my oppinion, it makes him sound like a toxic little kid. jesus this reddit is so annoying.
---
What i read:
---
&gt; Bro it's just my opinion to his opinion.
---
&gt; How dare you have an opinion to my opinion, jesus this reddit is so annoying.
---
This video is bc or wotlk but I like that it brings closure to the Echo Isles story that started in Classic. You make a deal with Loa Bwonsamdi to help you out killing the usurper for good this time.
---

---
I don't think anyone has ever claimed you need to minmax to play the game and clear content. The only environment where you need to do that is with other minmaxers.  You don't need to feel offended because you focus on some cherry picked occasions where someone was being a dick about it.
---
Yeah I remember doing this in BC for sure 
---
Fellow droods
---
we were useless till a year after wow launched, 1.6ish
---
We were the cartoony watered down version of mage/rogue/priest 
---
We had all the fun in pvp, rooting, cheetah run, unable to be rooted or morphed and MOONFIRE
---
If u wanna raid fast id suggest another class
---
if your gametime consists out of exploring and stealth dungeon runs then roll drood xD
---
A perfect score!
---
I feel you brother :(
---
We shouldn't need battle groups, especially at the start. Blizz wants to keep the essence/feeling of vanilla, and that is without crbgs. Crbgs were added as a solution to a problem, that hopefully we won't have come classic, as long as pop caps are decent ~5k+. It's going to be extremely lame and honestly a huuuge turnoff if crbgs are in from the start.
---
I'm pretty sure it came in a later patch in Legion, not with the expansion's launch
---
Damn, that's a big yikes from me. Thanks for posting it.
---
Now i feel awful for Jane
---
In the PServer i'm playing right now, some lvl 30\~35 allies in alterac mountains have the habit to farm my beefy char and my bones mates lvl 20\~25 in hillsbrad..  
---
I'm pretty sure i ll turn this place in my minotaur's labyrinth sometime  
---
I peed my pants playing Mario64 a few times.
---
Orgrimmar has consistently been the worst faction city, and somehow they made it worse with the redesign. 
---
Saying if you take it slow you can still finish naxx even without world buffs/consumables tooooo the maaxxxx.  Your point actually validates a lot of what semi-hardcore guilds would do for progression.  90%+ of naxx guilds probably wont beat all the content in 2-3 weeks or whatever private servers do.  They will take 2-3 months learning fights 1-2 days a week and eventually have enough gear to finish without minmaxing as they similar to the poster will eventually be "overgeared" as you would call it.
---
Who is to say min maxers are all toxic? I'm a cutting edge raider in live right now and will probably minmax my character just because it's what I find enjoyable. I love seeing the amount of damage I can put out and any little thing I did wrong that hurt me. Did I move 10 extra feet then I needed to causing me to get 1 less cast off? Let's fix that!! Shit like that.
---
What happened to "xxxDeadlySniperxxx"? 
---
According to everything I've seen it is.  Here is a wiki about it, 
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Lotus
---
I think what we'll see is just tanks flasked except the top couple guilds on each server.
---
your aunt/ cousin / friend cannot decide on his wedding date. looking for a venue and they have got tonfind something soon. marriage HAS to happen before september because the bride is pregnant.
---
your godfather is getting released from prison. he knows the date of parole but can’t communicate it just now - hes in solitary confinement until god knows when. 
---
your first crush just left an unhealthy relationship and wants to come visit. waiting for her to book the tickets.
---
you’ve put your brother in rehab - you want to be there for him when he comes out. god only knows when henwill be ready to start planning his discharge.
---
get creative.. LIE. your character progression depends on it!
---
Actually you get 4 extra keybinds from it, from using ctrl alt and shift.
---
I was Alliance in Vanilla and some good spots were...
---
- The Org-Grom'Gol Zeppelin. As a NElf Hunter (usually joined by a Rogue friend) we could just hide out downstairs stealthed and wait for it to zone into STV and turn everyone PvP flagged.
---
- Tyr's Hand, as it was an active farming spot back in the day.
---
- The Twlight's Hammer camps or the elemental corner area in Silithus, again active farming spots.
---
- Astranaar-Splintertree Post road often had ongoing battles, as did Southshore-Tarren Mill.
---
- World boss spawns, if they spawned during peak times and word got out fast enough, often turned into larger brawls too. From watching videos it *looks like* this is more intense on pservers than it was in Vanilla, oftentimes you'd get a clear shot at worldbosses in Vanilla.
---
- The chains inside Blackrock Mountain, particularly if you had some form of mind control or knockback. 
---
Hakkar was pretty prevalent in classic Troll culture
---
Isn't that the menu theme in that unreleased warcraft adventure game also?
---
Yes, but SM gives 10%, so there is only a 5% net gain changing talents.
---
Why do people say a limitation. When it was confirmed by two of the original devs to be a design choice?
---
The servers based on Blizzs current action and keeping too authenticity will be 2.5k-3k 
---
Mark kern and john staats were the two devs to confirm it. 
---
10k is not resonable without including sharding, dynamic spawns, allowing players to tag ur mob and increasing spawn rates of certain things like black lotus.
---
Imagine not 400-600 in each starting zone but 1600-2400 in each starting area. 
---
your head kinda tracks side-to-side when turning anyway -  if you're stationary on a mount you can alternate holding A + D to get your mount to wag it's head if you hold each button as long as you can without actually turning
---
Late 2005(ish)?
---
Best I can do. All I remember is melee classes in +SPI gear being able to damn near self heal between mobs.
---
Still waiting for the PvP content blue post to know for sure but if they're basing Classic on 1.12 *my bet* would be they'll have them, because they were introduced in 1.12.
---
Of course if they opt for much higher pop caps than Vanilla had they might not need them, but with their focus on #nochanges I'd sooner put money on Battlegroups being there instead of "non-Vanilla-style" larger server populations.
---
No it doesnt. It doesn't fucking say that. You wanna know how I know that? He doesn't say anything at all. He just posted a KT kill video with no description, so I had to look up the details myself.  
---
&gt; Saying if you take it slow you can still finish naxx even without world buffs/consumables  
---
I agree, but then again, this is how raid progression generally works.
---
Did you miss the memo where it's only going to be active in raids?
---
Who says horde are bad guys?
---
Back in the day as in, Vanilla WOW?
---
Nah man, having to play a gnome/dwarf/tauren is a risk I'm not willing to take.
---
Also you can get black lotus that spawns in giants, it will also protect you from gankers while picking it. 
---
It’s that or get a UTI!
---
doesn't disprove what I said tho
---
i hope we get zone scaling, even in classic, you could out level a zone less than half way through it ... 
---
What a terrible idea, you have no way of knowing if they are good players or not. I hate wasting my time in dungeon with people that are bad.
---
Yes, because nothing says nostalgia like hemorrhoids, impacted bowels, and long-term constipation issues!
---
Just a hint:min maxer aren't necessarily terrible human beings, I will min max Because I like doing high dps, that's it. 
---
You guys on this sub are getting ridiculous with this min max hate 
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Made up numbers and bugs galore, playing a server right now and I can't complete a level 20 quest because the mob can't be attacked from &gt;10 yards out and does 1/2 your hp in 3 hits in 1 second rapid fire and then knocks you down with a kick from 20 yards out. 
---
i purely ground from 49-53 in unguro and then went to the felwood and winterspring for the last bit 
---
Just open your laptop, overlap your login, and play on the vanity while you go.  No one else did that?
---
exactly, nice bringing this up guy!
---
Ahhh good times good times
---
It's pretty obvious from my OP. People that have played on private servers thinking they know how it was on retail. They're saying you need max buffs. As in: [They probably watched this bullshit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMEweKgWHro) Scaring people away. Having them think you need to no-life to raid because of the sheer amount of consumables needed. Spending hundreds of gold per raid. As I said, I no-lifed on retail. But that was only because I was in a top-tier raiding guild. And even then, it wasn't as bad as some people on private servers claim it to be.
---
Tried that until my butt/legs started falling asleep. :(
---
Trading Loot is bad. Fixing loot mistakes are good.
---
Lol how would they even qualify MPvP? Submit your ID? Adult website enter your age gimmicks? 
---
Palliance
---
i didnt called anyone a terible human being or anything close to that but ok
---
Oh yeah I'm not complaining, just preparing myself for the furthest date in an effort to not disappoint myself lol
---
Our guild doesn't enforce looking up tactics (we are casual after all) but it would be impossible to enforce 40+ people to not know anything. As much as we'd like it, it's not feasible so all we can do is not enforce it upon people. At the end of the day there's always gonna be 1 guy who knows what to do, whether form raiding back in the day, farming the bosses on retail, or looking up guides.
---
It's not realistic to try and build (and keep) a fully functional successful raid guild with 100% people who don't know anything. Any good guild leader knows people come and go, and you need more than the minimum of 40 people to keep raids going. You are always going to need to recruit and by only recruiting people who know nothing... yeah no that's not a feasible recruitment strategy. Sure you might be able to get a guild at the start, but a few months down the line? Some people will get bored, life will happen, maybe they never hit 60. You will need to start replacing and recruiting, with your pool to recruit form getting smaller and smaller.
---
Best of luck finding a place that works for you but I would not lock yourself into such an idea.
---
Ice block too if you have lag or slow reflexes
---
It was enabled in 1.12
---
Calls us entitled by saying:
---
\&gt; "Friday approaches and there is no new bluepost or release date........Be happy they are taking the time to keep us in the loop"
---
Puts "Where is our weekly update and release date?" at the end of his post...
---
Sounds like Taurens have small pps (personal problems). 
---
I’ll just be “that guy” on the normal PvP server who constantly adds RP flair to everything. 
---
Why?
---
Splitting the community means less chances for Retail players to bleed into Classic when they see activity on the channel, also Classic is going to be far more static than Retail will ever be so in 6-12 months after launch when the vast brunt of the work is done any Classic focused leveling Discord is going to have minimal chat at best with nothing but the same dozen or so questions being asked before people leave.
---
Classic is niche enough with Speed leveling being even more so.
---
This is kinda sad but rings true in hindsight... took 1 day to do all the non timegated quests in 8.1.5...
---
the guild i was in on a recent successful private server was the best i've ever been in and we regularly wiped on MC trash because we were too busy rolling for gold and joking about.  Most people sorta-min-maxed and took consumables seriously, but we also went to raids to have fun and not just finish the game in as little time as possible
---
a bunch of us will be on classic and i cant wait to see all my warriors pulling aggo on trash and dying after doing 3k dps in the first second - causing the mob to run riot through the raid until a tank has taunt ready.  it's gonna be such a laugh  
---
min-maxing is a natural behaviour but enforcing it for the sake of minor improvements is (a) lame and (b) totally unnecessary.  I'd sooner have an attentive ret pala in blues in my raid than a t2 rogue that isn't really trying and coasts through
---
I actually agree with this. It got significantly worse after Activison took hold of the reigns, but there were bad decisions made way before then. Flying mounts and leaving the original game world, all happened within the first expansion for example. 
---
That's just because more pvp players rolled Horde. :\^)
---
And if they do we'll post to Reddit and/or make a video guide. Plenty of other ways of getting the information out there.
---
  /wooooosh
---
I have done this.. am I a bad person?!!!11
---
what about all the lotus generated during AV
---
Yeah, I never played on a private server, but I was watching a video, for research, and the guy started talking about how people in classic didn't know to flask or about world buffs.  Claiming there was about 4 black lotus in the whole game.  Once he started saying that feral didn't exist because people didn't know about power shifting, I thought to myself keep your tips to yourself, I'm out.
---
Butters I need you to freeze me 
---
I'll play vanilla on and off forever. That game is a key part of my childhood and nothing can change that now. I'll always get a craving for STV PVP, adventuring in West Fall, experiencing the spooky atmosphere of Duskwood.
---
But I feel we are in a small minority. To keep classic alive things will have to grow and evolve. 
---
[http://gph.is/1kK4Xrd](http://gph.is/1kK4Xrd)
---
It's a 1.12 base. It is even explicitly said by blizz that they are using 1.12 and working back. Just because something was in the game at 1.12 does not mean it will be in the game from the start. That is why they are doing phases, to release the content similar to how it was released in vanilla, but not exactly (just look at the content releases, it's not how the content was released in vanilla). They have changed things to keep a more vanilla essence/experience for the better. 
---
We're not getting 1.12 at launch. #nochanges like you're mentioning would actually mean insane changes, because we would be getting 1.12 content at launch. That would suck majorly, imho. So many people misunderstand what blizz is doing when they see 1.12.
---
So knowing this we shouldnt expect crbgs to be in the game until much later, for obvious reasons.
---
Or are you saying you expect crbgs to be in the game at some point, rather than at the start because it's 1.12? 
---
We have a weekly post basically. Just keeping it fresh :) 
---
I hope so! 
---
I know it is not the same, but what if you guys (im going PVP server) make a big post or a discordserver where you decide on launch day to take a PVP server and make it your RP-PVP server? It is not the same, but if there are enough people doing it, you could create your own RP-PVP server. As far as I have read it has come to my understanding that on RP-PVP are a lot of non-RP'ers anyways. So having regular PVP's join the server would not be that big of a deal. This might be a solution if Blizzard does not introduce RP-PVP servers at launch.
---
Ion said they have no plans for it atm. 
---
It will all turn out okay. Only the top guild or two per server is going to be hardcore. Some advice, I would probably avoid the most popular server in your region. It will probably have a lot of streamers and their followers, these might be slightly more hardcore than your average server. 
---
In vanilla I was pve and I do hate getting ganked, but I don’t wanna miss out on a pvp server this time round 
---
I think in the 1.12 version of AV it didn't spawn.
---
I see. Did not know this. Thanks.
---
If you can't flask for KT, what will you flask for?
---
Np! 
---
Those lifts suck though. Love the UC. 
---
Horde generally has better PvP racials, Alliance PvE 
---
Exactly! LotR made me HYPED for Dwarven cities. But you never get to see a populated one. WoW IF fulfilled that dream
---
Quest Helper was the addon I used for end of TBC and through WotLK so I really hope it gets updates, it was such a great addon
---
And also for that sweet sweet pvp ownage
---
You misspelled dh. Their quote are edgyness personified. 
---
You didn't say shit. All you did is post a KT kill video with a karma baiting title.  
---
LOL A KT KILL VIDEO I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE BEFORE.  
---
MFW you post a KT Kill vid trying to karma bait the casuals on this subreddit and you get only 26 omegalul
---
You mean when I jump in the air and 360 my camera in midair to noscope boobs they can't see my trickshots?! Lame.
---
Don't be rude
---
I was the one who has no life in Vanilla, and I laughed my ass off because every wow nerd stereotype in that episode was so fucking true.
---
I'm saying I expect they'll make an appearance and I don't think it'll be in the last phase of PvP content release. I wouldn't be surprised if they rolled out the all the BGs, the Honor System, and Battlegroups early on in the process. I think it's more likely than not that we'll get Battlegroups at the same time we get Battlegrounds.
---
With it not being removed until wrath I think we need it to stay in classic. If it took that long to change either it wasnt that big of an issue or changing it previously would have been a balance problem.
---
I would guess not. 
---
Yes that’s correct. It’s what you’d expect. You can shift to bear tank at a moments notice, but you have 1/3 of the spells of a normal tank. Same with dps in cat or human form. Plus heals
---
Overall you’re gonna have more spells than everyone but in each form your kit is limited
---
That being said, your kit overall is extremely versatile, so if you’re good with knowing what skill and when to shift, you can take most anyone in a 1v1. It’s just very hard to know druid inside and out and manage mana. Huge skill cap
---
&gt; I think the post was intended to keep people from assuming raiding wasn't possible without BiS everything. 
---
I've literally never seen anyone say that.
---
I love this.  "Vanilla is as pure as the wind-driven snow, and everything after that was absolute shit."  It's like that Cake lyric "As soon as you're born you start dying."  
---
Haha this is awesome! Love the detail on the doors :D
---
seriously, you could find a raid spot on any EU or Oceanic server.  Your ping would be higher, but with 400ms spell batching, it's really not going to be noticeable
---
Might happen. Too early to say yet. It also depends how popular classic remains. I honestly think it might even overtake retail if handled correctly, many years down the line.
---
Or just strafe and keep the pet on the same line you’re walking. That’ll be much faster than the dreaded S keybind. 
---
Of course, how could I forget...
---
I've never got passed R11. How does people actually get R14?
---
Like, I realize that you have to farm with premades but how many hours per day and for for long, generally?
---
I quit at the exact same point. When the pre-cata patch hit, I found that I hadn't logged in for a week straight. I saw my way out of the addiction and cancelled my sub. Didn't occur to me until now that wasn't just quitting because it was the end of an era, but because the game had changed so much that I didn't care anymore. I am ridiculously keen for this re-release.
---
Look for Taldril's druid tanking vanilla guide, the best one I've ever read so far
---
I played a shaman to 85. Honestly I had more fun as elemental than enhancement. Except at 49 with a Rockpounder. 
---
As another ex hardcore raider those videos piss me off. Kid killed 3 bosses before bc and wants to educate us on naxx? Bitch please.
---
A lot of people need In Dreams for their pre raid bis. That's a good spot indeed. 
---
[This one is an insane all around build.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxGgsc0zLVxsoxo) I did a lot of the grind using it while raiding into bwl where I mainly healed, but would serve as tank with certain pulls.
---
[And then here is more of a "flag running" spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZxMuoZVxfoeq0o), but would still allow you heal raids and even tank 5mans, but tanking will be a bit harder with this spec.
---
From what I heard after a certain point everything was viable so do what you love baby. 
---
daily optimization crying post 😢 
---
What does this do
---
The Moonkin dance is the only reason to play Druid 
---
Blizzard has announced that Classic = 1.12 talents so no stuff from TBC
---
Risk of Rain 2 has been a fun time sink for me lately while waiting for clasdic.
---
Something i discovered doing deadmines on a pserver last night:
---
I main warlock, and the foundry room makes people wish I was a mage. It is legit pretty hard on a fresh server because the goblins summon elite mechs. The summon is not interruptible normally (except by stuns etc.)
---
I discovered that I can easily interrupt the golem summon at range. You can do this by fearing the target during their cast, and then immediately putting curse of recklessness on them to prevent them from aggroing the rest of the room. And BOOM one less trash mob elite to fight.
---
This may not be news to people, but I literally just realized you could do this.
---
Nope, but gloves of the fang are probably one of the more recognizable items in the game. And of course...batman with fang gloves.
---
This episode is so funny..is that the one where Cartman becomes the time child? The United Atheist Alliance that are all Otters lmfao
---
Seriously doubt it.....but I’m in! Fingers crossed my friend 
---
As long as the flag gets capped, this wouldnt bother me.
---
A man has been misunderstood.
---
No, I think it might just be you.
---
I have a shaman, but I didn't level it until cataclysm and then mainly used her to farm boe epics in Firelands.
---
All three specs were fun, but obviously never got to try 2 handed enhance.
---
than*
---
Attendance &gt; class.
---
If you show up, essentially nothing else matters. Even through naxx. Maybe the tip top guild on the server won't take more than 2-3 druids but everyone else takes whoever is online. 
---
The train went past the station 
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Says a drug addict. Any dependencies are pathetic... 
---
Then dont play the game.
---
Or play the game the way you want with like minded people.  Depending how far from optimal you and those people decide to go will decide how far you can get in the game.  Just dont ask for nerfs to content or buffs your spec because of it.
---
Yeah what he said is bullshit.
---
Go back to crying about Fornite.
---
That being said, Boltied, your grammar is atrocious. Looser
---
Thanks lad
---
I can also report someone for harassment on a real Blizzard run server sooooo....
---
We carried buffs from loatheb to sapph to kt typically. 
---
I'm actually surprised pve server is more desired over pvp for RP servers.  If you are roleplaying wouldnt the factions being at war be a huge part of that?
---
If I remember right, there is a helmet about level 40 that will give you full energy on a power shift in cat form. 
---
Wait those r my boys from bedpan boys cherrypapi clangnbang razz lmao I gotta show them this 
---
I read that as *they're releasing the game now* FML
---
Woa, a whole guild? Blizzard are definately going to make a bunch of servers now. There's no way they could resist this insane demand. RPPvP is saved guys, this guy did it!
---
*Hewwo sushi drake!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** nunoalc! ^(hug)
---
1000+ hours put into dark souls, even completed it with one hand on the controller. Angry ape man in Sekiro has been shitting on me for a week. Sekiro is rough lmao.
---
Between how simple of a concession it is for Blizzard to add and Ion's statement that they're open to the idea if they see enough support, I really expect we'll see at least a handful of them at launch. Adding them post-launch will just damage the communities that begin establishing themselves on RP-PvE servers. 
---
The hardcore guys are going to rush the content and than login for 2-4 hours a week to super fast clear content and than log off.  I don't think they really know what is possible in classic they just play the same thing over and over again.
---
Me too!
---
&gt; if they see enough support
---
Hence the post
---
Probably best to do something like that on PVE server
---
It makes no sense to have no rppvp. I want to play rppvp sooo bad. Give me an out from the pvp 13 year olds plz. 
---
:( sorry friend 
---
As someone who has never played on any classic/vanilla server or even on a Rp server let alone a Pvp-rp server. One thing that I did enjoy back in the day and still to this day was the server community. I found it so fun to see someone call out that the other faction was raiding a city like Origmmar and call for some help to fight back. I know that this is only a small part of what Rp is/was all about but there is/was something to just dropping everything to go to the city and fight for the honor of your faction. I miss the days when a rogue would sneak in the Ah just to mess with the people trying to buy/sell and someone would take it upon themselves to defend them or the possible patrons. Then the next thing you know that one person would turn into two then four then it could and sometimes would turn into a whole hunting party that would start to "return the favor" so you would end up with a huge fight between factions that made it feel like you were a true part of a brotherhood that stood and worked together. That was my WoW and that was our faction that was why I was always proud to stand and /yell FOR THE HORDE (sorry got to represent).
---
This is something that I have come to learn was way more common in Pvp-rp servers. This is why I look to roll on a Pvp-rp server so that I can feel like I am a part of something greater. Part of a community that stood together for good or bad right or wrong we were in it together. We have come so far and so close to this, please don't make me feel like I am going to miss the chance to retake what is my WoW what is our Wow.
---
On use, reduces fall speed for 10 seconds. Has like an hour cooldown though
---
So basically you had a script that was something like (sorry I don't know WOW macros) :
---
`/target &amp; pet attack Tremor Totem`  
---
`/target &amp; pet attack Windfury Totem`
---
`/ etc`
---
etc and you just spammed it until all them totems had been destroyed by your pet ?
---
I remember dancing in moonkin form in the SW throne, yelling "Hail to the King!". And tons of people joined me in dancing. 
---
Why not start your own guild?
---
-Asks if something works
---
-Gets an actual answer
---
-Wahh min/maxers ruin this game
---
To me it seems you are the one that doesnt know what is possible in classic by thinking raiding is the only endgame in vanilla lol
---
wondering the same
---
This. I want that poster! OP Pls
---
Jerking off also helps a lot
---
The sickest rogues are able to vanish spells and abilities. As in the caster gets the spell off and you vanish right as the cast bar completes so their spell takes mana, and does absolutely nothing to you. 
---
Why would they do that just for classic (where it's basically completely unknown how many will try it at launch) and not for any of the 7 WoW expansions that had millions of guaranteed customers, which were all given a street date months before release and had extensive testing on PTRs?
---
If anything Blizzard will want to *build* hype for Classic, not prevent it getting it out of the door a week after an announcement.
---
😂
---
There are plenty of people out there who disagree.  They cite Drek as one of the most deadly NPC's as their evidence.  They ignore that Drek has a higher kill count because more allies make it to him than (horde to) Van.  
---
r/ClassicWoW: We want WoW without all the hand holding!  
---
Also r/ClassicWoW: Here's a list of add-ons that will hold your hand every step of the way.
---
Looks great man super jealous
---
&gt; I think it's more likely than not that we'll get Battlegroups at the same time we get Battlegrounds.
---
No way man. Crbgs are really bad for the community. That would be a really bad move on blizzards part. That would be a huge change to the game.
---
&gt;having Diremaul or ZG out early creates imbalance in PvE progression for example. I don't think those same concerns apply (on anywhere near the same scale) to Battlegrounds
---
Some of the best gear in the game comes from battlegrounds/ranking until aq40/naxx, and even then. The honor system adds some really easy to obtain gear (rank8/10) that is VERY strong in pve. The rank14 weps are REALLY strong in pve, bis until Cthun/Late Naxx.
---
All of this is kinda beside the point though. We want a vanilla experience, and that is without crbgs. You want to be able to queue up for a BG, and know who you are fighting against. You want to have rivals. You don't want to play against no-namers that you will never see again from some backwater server. Crbgs came at the end of vanilla, and while it cut the queue times down for some people primarily on pve realms where imbalance was magnified, it killed a large part of the community and sense of server.
---
Same name?
---
There’s been a lot of shitty games, but also some of the best games in recent years have come out recently as well: Spider-Man, God of War, RDR2, Persona 5
---
I haven’t had the chance to play any of them yet, but I’ve heard they’re all great
---
Oh they'll definitely see you 360 no scope. They just wont see your neck snap while you do it!
---
Even better: Play the game and stop fucking racing to 60. I got to the point where I uninstalled questie/quest helper because I realized it was actually making me not enjoy playing.
---
It felt like chasing arrows in Skyrim. This isn't a race.
---
Do you actually see this, or do you see people asking what's "viable"? Because viable in this context means one of the better classes like you mentioned. If viable meant possible then literally everything would be viable and the question would be moot.
---
    /petattack
---
    /petattack [target=mana tide totem]
---
    /petattack [target=tremor totem]
---
    /petattack [target=grounding totem]
---
    /petattack [target=windfury totem] 
---
You can only bop people in your group in vanilla.
---
This was on pservers. Not sure if on vanilla. More of an anti thing for shamans really. As a shaman don't have lightning shield on in neutral towns like goblin places. A ranged attacker on the opposite faction can tag you from a safe distance and since your lightning shield retaliates, you'll be clobbered by the guards while they run away.
---
True dat.
---
[You get +20 energy](https://www.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm)
---
Make threads on the official classic forums. That'll teach em :)
---
Well it's like a when a mother bear protects her cubs, right?
---
You wanna run, but you should be playing dead and covering your neck.
---
You might even think of running or climbing a tree, but a bear will beat you up.
---
Is that Tyler1?
---
God forbid the game mechanics encourage you to group up with another human playing a healer in an MMO...
---
That would be awful since i have to plan my vacation two months in advance
---
people: ReD iS DeAd
---
also people: lmfao cross-faction collab? sure
---
Yes rppvp
---
I think it’s just going to be 3 different social circles in wow.
---
The min / maxers
---
The consistent raiders 
---
And everyone else. 
---
For Khaz'Modan!
---
\*QUAS, WEX, EXORT!\*
---
So lying would be better? Telling people that "yea your stupid shit idea will work well!"? Not sure why it is bad thing that people who knows their shit gives honest Insights about stuff when asked.
---
There was a trick with the Crystal of Zin-Malor that I used to use on my rogue back in the day. Earlier releases of vanilla, vanishing during a boss fight would cause you to go out of combat and remain out of combat during a wipe. When Blizzard released a patch that made out of combat rezzing impossible, it also made it such that when rogues vanish, they only go out of combat for a fraction of a second and will die when the raid wipes.
---
With the crystal, you could create a macro to vanish and simultaneously equip the trinket in the event of a raid wipe. Vanishing would take you out of combat for just long enough to get the trinket equip and with your aggro reset, you'd have plenty of time before anything aggrod towards you. Let the crystal do its work and DIE asap! This would prevent me from having a repair bill at the end of a raid progression night 
---
On the left? Yeah.
---
I thought headtracking was awsim.
---
On the h\*pe server there was exactly *one* cutting edge brutal hardcore guild (Progress) who made people perfect Naxxramas on a PTR before it even came out.
---
Such dedication wasn't seen by any guild before or after yet.
---
Even Dreamstate,Return, NOPE and others looked like amateurs to the neckbeardery that Progress took the raiding scene. 
---
So really, there will be plenty of semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. But there will be very, very few topnotch neckbeard guilds.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) They get my sword alright.
---
I'll have you know I have over 300 confirmed parties attended.
---
It's funny how you are hardcore, cutting edge and all that yet you make one of the dumbest grammar mistakes.
---
Thx for the explanation!
---
Nothing better than jizzing to “rogues do it from behind” music video while waiting for classic
---
Question for more experienced Druids: **is it viable to heal raids in a Feral specc?** 
---
I have a slight urge to roll a Feral Druid in Classic. But I'm not sure if I wanna be a melee DPS in raids, especially with the complex rotation that Feral apparently has. Do you think it would be viable for me to heal as Feral if I gather up some healing gear?
---
KOS is something completely different than organizing a cross faction group to monopolize a whole zone.  
---
Thats what most people are talking about when they complain about these specs.  Things like ret pally and the shaman dps specs do well in pvp.
---
For Scholo and Strat, you should definitely be asking pallies also.  I'd venture to say that prot pallies are the *best* tanks for scholo and strat.
---
&gt; Someone would already have the ony head and saved it for the guild turnin
---
Yes but you still have to go there and kill her. It doesn't magically appear in your bags.
---
OP plays mains goblin for the lore and believes Sylvanas is morally gray, confirmed.
---
That's when you bop the rogue and put him in time out.
---
Many of us find the act of speed leveling to be enjoyable. I like seeing how much faster I can go compared to my last alt.
---
Its still weird to me just how *early* so many people seem to have to submit their PTO.  Im still 'only' at 2 weeks here, but they could announce the date a few weeks before and i'd be fine.  My boss probably wont be ecstatic if i take a full week straight, but he wont stop me.
---
Granted, im probably going to try to take a couple 4 day weekends and split it up.  I dont really want to deal with no work for a week and a half or more and then come back.  Im much better off splitting the time up.
---
Yes, I have tanked plenty of dungeons from people messaging me out of the blue.
---
But I also have no problem saying no if I don't have the time or don't feel like it.
---
I also remember frequently using /who back in Vanilla when we needed healer or X class for dungeon. It's no more difficult than LFG and it lets you talk to people and feel them out before grouping up.
---
There has been server first 60's that were mage, people don't even remember that on ND the 2nd highest lvl was a mage, he would've won if he wasn't griefed and respawns weren't broken on his last aoe spot. And that's on a pserver were the #1 abused buggy mobs, where as AOE is very consistent on pservers.
---
I wasnt talking about op, i was refering to the comment above stating that after you clear a raid that you got nothing to do like in retail, which isnt even remotly true
---
Seriously.  I dont even use it much anymore, but i used to a *lot* when i tanked more.  Taking one or two steps back ensures no mobs are to your side so you wont get crit.
---
Awesome, I'm planning on rolling a resto druid, too! I heard bad things about them at first, but more and more I hear that they're great and that lots of people played them!
---
Moonkin is def the funniest form.
---
On the 2 prominent private servers of course?
---
&gt; private server rep which was TBC values? In vanilla WoW rep was a lot less than private servers and level 50 being exalted with another faction doesn't sound right.
---
This part. This was fixed on pservers.
---
The Warcraft 3 reforged poster is a good touch 
---
Agreed.  Kara should be a 20man raid that is slightly more difficult and slightly better gear than AQ20/ZG.  Emerald Dream shoudl be a 40 man raid on the same difficulty as Naxx, with gear that's the same power level but different stats to open up more specs.
---
seriously all these old ass farts claiming there's no good games and how everyone just plays battle royales is so fucking funny to me. like sorry you cant search out good games or even keep an ear to the ground for em. 
---
Both ideally.
---
Hunter in vanilla, Pally from BC until bfa. Plan to go back to hunter 
---
I cant..
---
Nevermind
---
You caught me at first with the red hat lol.
---
Goes for Warrior charge too.
---
What you'll actually need: Water to stay hydrated and comfortable clothes.
---
The word is "NO!"
---
yeah cause there wasn't any bad games released from 2004-2006. have ya tried sekiro, divinity, sub nautica, frostpunk, insurgency sandstorm, or rust? to name a few 
---
The more I read the more practical it seems to do gnomish first then unlearn for goblin. Thanks for the insight. 
---
In short, yes. However, you are slightly gimping yourself. If you want a spec that can transition between solo/PvP/raiding then a 0/30/21 spec is perfect. You won't be fantastic at dps or healing in a raid setting, but you can definitely do both. As far as PvP goes, that spec slays face (Heat of the wild and Nature's Swiftness is bananas).
---
If you can get into a raid as a hybrid then you are doing what the druid class is meant to do.
---
The few times I've done it is if a sub-optimal class like a priest or warlock is carrying it and under heavy attack, and I'm right next to them.  BOP saves their life or at least extends it, and I can grab it and start running like hell.  Plus my pal was naxx geared so I was much tankier than some other random people in t1/etc. 
---
I fucking hope not. That week or 2 needs to be taken off in advance. I'd rather not have to rely on sweet talking
---
I couldn't even keep my 5 raiders in destiny from looking up the encounters even though all of them agreed not to do it.
---
same fam
---
based on what you just posted I don’t think you should be making judgements about who’s fun at parties
---
As a guild that has been a top 3 finisher (and 1st NA) on every private server for the last 4 years we've found that 3-4 druids in an Alliance raid is actually fantastic if your druids are experienced and smart.
---
They bring 4 battle rez and they can easily compete on healing output with hots rolling on 5-10 people while spamming out healing touches.
---
Aq and naxx have a lot of raid damage going out so when you have hots rolling on nearly the entire raid you dont have to hard cast a heal on 40 different people.
---
It’s just you.  Yes if you ask people if a balance Druid is viable for raiding they’ll say no, so you can’t play with world first guilds boohoo.  There’s way more to the game than rushing raiding anyway.  Every spec and class is good at something. Most of the “meme specs” like Elemental Shaman are gods in PvP for example. Vanilla is not retail where everyone is good at everything.
---
Warriors will get flash heal, yeah. 
---
No.
---
crbgs are for pop inbalance more than dead servers. It's going to be a much bigger turn off for people to have 30min+ queues. 
---
"you don't need to min/max to kill KT, you just have to farm the rest of Naxx for 13 weeks straight! fuck you tryhards XD"... I'm not a tryhard I'm a no-lifer, there's a difference!"
---
There were plenty of meme parrots shrieking this stuff on Northdale. 
---
yes, 0/30/21 is viable in raids and in pvp
---
It's been very well established that during vanilla many people who became rank 14 did so by playing 16-20 hours per day. Or more. Impossible to do without account sharing. The vast majority of rank 14s I saw during actual vanilla (not PSs) were solo players and were generally not involved in premades. That said however, premades are probably the way to go to attain the rank and thus will likely be the more popular technique during classic.... for the first 11 ranks at least. 
---
After that, any agreements or strategies that involve cooperation with the goal of systematically getting the few dozen or so to GM or HW in a particular order will simply fall apart since players are guaranteed to abandon this plan so they can be THE FIRST. That is why I'm so confident that the first few rank 14s in the server will be account sharing... they'll do ANYTHING to become the first. 
---
There's really no classes that do the SAME thing at all. They are all unique. 
---
Yup, amazing guide.
---
Second. 30/21 was one of the funnest specs ever and I ran with it for quite a long time.
---
I honestly jump sometimes in dungeons when I hear a rogue use cheap shot on a mob. It's burned into my mind!
---
Literally every fight against a leveling priest when your CS runs out.
---
rouges are overpowdered
---
Yes on the same pserver that people got 3d and 7h, not to mention this was a drawn out speedrun meaning he didn't play for 40 hours in a row which decreases efficiency. He's currently playing on a pserver fresh launch and he's struggling because he has no experience in nolifing on launch and all his testing comes from playing essentially empty servers so he doesn't know how to get ahead.
---
I'd be thrilled with a date. 
---
I think you're confused. We were talking about getting rid of titanforging not raid difficulties. I wouldn't mind lfr getting axed, but having a normal and heroic raid tier was probably one of their top 5 best ideas they've implemented into the game.
---
Well, if somebody put in &gt; 2000 hours into the creation of something (source: CountdownToClassic interview with these creators) I think it is only fair for them to charge something for it. And you are obviously not their target audience, otherwise you won't have to ask this question.
---
If I wanted to be a fast leveler I would definitely buy a guide. You can bet your ass everybody and their mother will follow the free guides and those using the paid guides will have a competitive edge.
---
It's kinda obvious but I'm pretty sure many people don't do it.
---
That's not really true in any sense? Every class is viable just not every spec.
---
lmao accurate. this is all of us. 
---
but classic wow, will be 1.12.1 talents.
---
I think any heals will be in fairly high demand, no matter the class.
---
Where in his post does he say that it should happen specifically because of his one guild?
---
&gt;Things like ret pally and the shaman dps specs do well in pvp.
---
I assume you mean enhancement shaman here, and no they are pretty shit. They are decent in world pvp and useless in BG's and larger fights.
---
It'll happen. It's just brownie points in the bank for them when they reveal it's being added. 
---
8/7 with rice.
---
Probably won't be possible since it's BFA client and I doubt this is something they will revert. 
---
Afaik not all of the episodes are available. You need a Hulu subscription to grt them all, so this one might not be available
---
Wow, that ejaculated quickly...
---
I think he was refering to elemental shaman, which you do take in bgs, you take 31/0/20 offensive healer shaman over full resto one
---
Still on the fence. Warlock, Hunter or Druid. I like WPVP and being useful, so druid sounds good...but I'm not that keen on the class fantasy. I just like the options the class brings. Plus, PvP looks like a lot of effort to do what other classes do easily.
---
All you did was remove functionality. Sure backpedaling isn't great in most situations.
---
Agreed you would never make it or get redrige ganked lol
---
Sounds like the internet is full of shit once again. I see an average of 5ish druids per raid. I run as swiftshifting on Lightbringer along with another feral or two and our guild completes MC/BWL/AQ40. Don't let the internet and idiots who have never played a druid dictate what the class can and cannot do. If you find a good guild they will take you.
---
Everyone always looks towards stratholme and scholomance when defending paladin tanking capabilities (just an observation). Its one thing to have a niche (the rune/orb farming) but thats a far cry from being a good fit for the role overall. I feel like wrath was the only time that there were enough undead to not mind abilities that only affect undead.
---
Also, it seems that the majority of paladin threat holding (for more than a single mob) is consecration. A single ability that requires you to spec outside for 11 points to even get it....... the whole thing just doesn't align with even the basic design philosophies of vanilla.
---
Having played both warrior and paladin...... paladin feels like a PvP tank where warriors feel good at a variety of things (burst dps, sustained dps, tanking, pvp).
---
You are here because you want new content in Classic WoW. The mere suggestion goes against the idea of Classic and its entire existence. Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the 1596th time we have shot these posts down, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.
---
Honest question: Are these gaming chairs really good?
---
My 15 year old chair is fnally starting to become a pile of dust so I'm need to buy a new one. But these gaming chairs look so uncomfortable and fragile I'm afraid it's just a "fad" or something to trick gamers into buying them.
---
Elemental shaman is indeed awesome. 
---
Though IMO 30-0-21 is superior.
---
I really hope you are right.
---
Aren't they made for long sessions tho? I mean, being a gamer chair and all
---
Lol. Most minmaxers / assholes pservers elitists, whatever their names, will tell you than you can't do anything past BWL with offspecs, without BiS and consumes. Hell, they will even tell you that you should be ashamed to not minmax, because it's not respectful for the other people of the raid. Also that you won't find anyone to play with, bla, bla, bla.
---
I wish I had time to throw away to make you a pretty compilation of all those comments.
---
As a rogue, you can stand right on top of the questgivers in booty bay and wait till someone accidentally clicks on you. The best place I've found is the flightmaster.
---
Try to READ the links before your confirmation bias grabs every piece of information that seem to support your case. That spreadsheet specifically compare Druid tanks to Warriors wearing a SHIELD. It's not a fair comparison. Druids primary role in a raid is as a THREAT tank, to raise the threat ceiling of your DPS.
---
For the MAJORITY of bossfights, guilds use a Dualwield furyprot warrior as a tank. THAT is what you need to compare it to. Not a full prot warrior with shield vs a Druid.
---
Literally none has ever said you need to minmax.
---
But I guess you just made up a false statement in your head so you can counter it 
---
Idk ICC was pretty cool and TotGC was pretty cool too
---
Don't forget how resto druids suddenly became a must have for TBC raids due to the insane mana effiency.
---
This is the kind of post people need to see.  The try-hard community is so frustrating sometimes.  We made weird comps work all the time back then.
---
Nah, Teldrassill and Undercity are the best cities
---
You freakin' nerd, I love it.
---
Depends on how cheap it is, and how early on. I would consider dropping 15g for one if they are that cheap. If DM is out, I'm not buying one. 19 stam isn't worth losing 9 int, 8 agility, and 1 crit for me.
---
CRBGs are demonized for no reason and are much more "vanilla-like" than 5,000 population realms.
---
im sure it would be feasible and fun to get people who never played vanilla, but not looking up the strats would be bruuuutal
---
we all watched vids and read up the tactics in vanilla and it was still hard.  people didn't know the optimum for talents, gear, positioning, strategy, raid composition, consumables so it was ALL trial-and-errored and theory crafted by very hardcore players who were then copied - so it took a lot of effort on a fairly large scale  
---
go look up a video of people killing ragnaros for the first time in vanilla and see how hyped everybody got.  on private servers, people breeze through MC and kill it on lvl 58 green-geared characters and dont bat an eye lol
---
\^ i said at the time that this was total BS and you needed more FR in vanilla and people were like "No m8 everyone is just 1337 now".  well they were proven wrong when someone from blizz said that private servers were doing resistances and boss armour all wrong and that it was way different in actual vanilla

I doubt that big time and if you want to prove me wrong then show me just a section of the paid guide that differs so much from the free guides that it would effectively give you a noticeable edge
---
I AM DEFINITELY GOING TO DO THIS TO MY FRIEND
---
I would rather talk you into playing a shaman. People ALWAYS highlight the negative about the class, with the thought in mind that it is a dps class. It is not, it is a support class with dps burst potential. You have a totem for every scenario that will help you and your party. They are great leveling partners. Great in five man's. Windfury totem is the most saught after buff for melee. In PVP they are a blast on all specs, with knowledge of said spec. Roll a shaman, you will be loved by others and always useful in some way. 
---
Hi Kenkoy
---
I still remember when you redid our site and put the leek song on there.  It drove people fuckin' nuts.  Good times.
---
i'm worried that if blizzard does add a rp-pvp realm later on, a lot of people who are already established elsewhere won't want to reroll and blizzard will go ''see? i told you so, they don't want it''
---
the classic wow developers seem like they care, but it also seems like this decision is coming from ion who only seems to care about raiding, or possibly even higher up
---
Yet most classes are fine solo, including healers (with a dps spec admittedly).
---
I mained a warrior in Vanilla, it's not as bad as OP seems to say.
---
My real pain points : tanking for clueless PUGs and PVPing with "only" blue gear.
---
My buddy once shot his pants to finish an arena....
---
Further proving my point. 
---
My camera is never zoomed in close enough for that kind of detail. 
---
Besides all what is posted above (class fantasy, lore, leader class), they have a quite varied skillset (Blessing of Freedom, 2 Bubbles, multiple different seals for different situations, can heal when needed, etc).
---
 It's just fun to play a Paladin overall. They won't be as efficient as an Arms warrior in PvP, but they are fun to play. 
---
Don't you guys have socks ?
---
Thats more like typical SF who goes the same items every game wihtout thinking about their team lineup at all. This of course after they have last pick and still pick SF into a poor matchup and rage BB when they get solo killed / ganked.
---
This is how it is at least in 5k mmr games
---
U alright m8?
---
No, both shaman dps specs do pretty well in pvp.  
---
Classic will never feel similar to vanilla and there's no point persecuting it if it costs how well the game is played. 
---
Where did I say they were all toxic?
---
Yeah in vanilla the hybrids are generally healers while the other specs are PvP and niche roles. I think the beauty of the paladin is that they can spec holy and still tank scholo/strath better than a warrior. They don't need holy shield and the other protection talents. Moreover they can actually spec deep prot/holy and still do excellent healing on farm raids while being able to do massive pulls and make good money from it. They also can tank raids. We have a prot paladin in our guild who tanks most bosses and heals/nightfalls on bosses where paladins definitely can't tank like Ebonroc, Nefarian and Ragnaros. 
---
this might only work on private servers cos i suspect it's incorrect, but:
---
if you're playing a rogue people will often dot you to prevent you from stealthing.  if you kite a bit you can get out of combat and time your re-stealth between dot ticks to get about 2 seconds of stealth and a new opener - or use it to dodge a spell that's being cast on you.  Even if the dot ticks and removes your stealth, it was probably still worth it just to stop them targeting you, casting on you etc

Warlocks can "fear dance" a target by fearing it, putting curse of recklesness (makes it immunte to fear, but your current fear debuff is still applyed to it) and then doing a "curse twist" with anotehr cure (like curse of agony).
---
So you can fear a mob and throw recklesness/agony/recklesness/agony/etc and prevent the feared mob from running where it would aggro more mobs.
---
No enhancement is literally the worst pvp spec in the game.
---
That seems to be the running theme for a lot of the "why". People like to dream up exciting and interesting reasons for things but it often is something far more ordinary. 
---
Prove it
---
Thats always an option (same with disenchanting).
---
I know, in shaman main myself and find most fun from 31/20/0
---
Good for them. 
---
I just want to enjoy vanilla the second time around with only the knowledge from 14 years ago. I'm sure there are others who feel the same or even some who just want to go into it with little to no knowledge and learn from their mistakes along the way
---
#nochanges, it should release in November
---
Shaman literally has the worst nightfall uptime of any class if you are gonna play enhancement don't play NF.
---
If you dont want to minmax dont minmax? Whats the problem?
---
Sounds like you are just mad you could not get into a good enough guild where everyone push their class to the full.
---
This definitely works, I start to do this when we've been looking for members for longer than 5 minutes.
---
Another strategy used on pservers is the /world channel. You join the channel, make a macro that spams general/trade (depending on location) + world chat with the same message, and click it every minute or so.
---
So you think the people that want paladins to continue to suck are actually...... agents of the horde, sent to reddit to sew the ideas that #nochanges is about preserving the game's integrity when its actually all a plan to keep the alliance down!?
---
Holy shit, you really are the best of texas! We must expose this foul plot!
---
i dont know why you were downvoted for this.  this sub is really weird about that
---
This gave me such feelings man...
---
Blizzard please empathize with us
---
Sorry what?
---
Elemental shaman is ALWAYS stronger than resto wtf.
---
Looking for a (raid) ambitious casual guild:
---
- EU (German / English)
---
- Horde
---
- Preferably PvP, PvE is OK too
---
- Max. 2 Raids per week
---
Started playing towards the end of Vanilla, played through all of TBC (cleared all raids except Sunwell). I'm going to play Warrior, I like both tanking and fury so I'm going for whatever the guild needs.
---
Rephrase and elaborate a bit? Not sure what you mean.
---
I don't see a case of diapers or bengay... you're doing it wrong
---
To add to the farseeing (Far Sight), a lot of people don't know you can cast it again once in farseeing to see even farther.  The range is something like 50000 yards.  You can look at your buddy in Thunderbluff while in Ogrimar.  Handy way to find spawns if you are looking for something, including nodes.
---
Nah man, prefixes, you know like "of the bear Long Sword" or "of Stamina leather hood"
---
(yes, suffixes, we didn't get prefixes until years later, haha)
---
Yes, even with a pet (in PvP for example) it's very usefull to have a swing timer addon and keep strafing back during the ranged swing cooldown.
---
look at Legacy players.  The data doesn't lie.  Top guilds people haven't logged in for 4 days....
---
That's the weakest argument you could have presented.
---
At the most basic comparison imaginable, the level cap being 60, talents being 1.12, spell batching being slowed down, etc. etc. all make Classic feel "similar" to vanilla. Similar is not a hard goal to meet.
---
It still took a lot of time and effort back then to get exalted with Frostwolf/Stormpike.  It was much later in Vanilla after they patched AV multiple times when the zerg race method even became possible.
---
Agreed. It has been said time and time again by players from top guilds that improving/optimising your gameplay. 
---
"All the gear, no idea" comes to mind. 
---
I'd try and convince you otherwise but you'd be in such high spirits I doubt I could bring you down.
---
You 100% need to free up Q and E(or something else). You can however turn on A &amp; D and then hold rightclick to start strafing. It's not really different. While I do it myself I do think rebinding to strafe and then having turn in arrow keys is better.
---
As for backpedalling, the only reasonable time you should backpedal is as a tank. There's definitely reasons to backpedal there. For any other class you can unbind it for an extra keybind but that's only if you actually need the keybind. You can keep it binded and just not use it in fights, there are sometimes when you are slacking that you just wanna backpedal.
---
I got the same one on ebay, I believe from the same seller as on Amazon.
---
You think Paladins "should not suck", that is a class change.
---
We want 1.12, not """balanced""" classes AKA retail.
---
In exchange for priests getting taunt in the disc tree 
---
Windfury, not Whirlwind
---
It's common knowledge mate. Enhancement has zero mobility, no reliant damage, only a slow as CC. You basically rely on walking up to people and hoping to oneshot them, you are basically a worse reckonng paladin. 
---
Oh..... now that you mention it............. I remember doing that all those years ago.
---
Good times, haha.
---
no but I believe it plays a role in people disdain towards them. Personally I thought shammy sucked for the longest time cause I rolled warrior and rolled through them. And I was Alliance so it aided in my preconceived notion. If you don't agree with me that's ok bud!
---
Is it to make it similar? Or maybe it's just to improve the actual game. 
---
Having high caps on some servers is an improvement. It allows people to choice what they want. 
---
... Argent... Dawn? :(
---
I don't know if links are allowed but I got mine on ebay from this guy. Very high quality, full resolution, no watermark.

---
Sir you’ve just blown my mind haha. 
---
As someone playing on a private server right now I have yet to encounter these people, however, I have encounter a lot of casual players playing whatever spec they want.
---
Its not. I didnt ask for your opinion.  I asked for proof since we disagree.  Please provide some.
---
Sekiro tho 
---
Sorry how the fuck am I supposed to prove that enhancements suck dick? How about you prove they don't?
---
I did think it sounded wrong
---
I cant believe i mixed those two up
---
Lmao.  I think we're done here.  Let me know if you can back up your baby rage.
---
In the in-game books (see [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azo0t3/wow_vanilla_all_50_ingame_lore_books_printable/)) there is only one that mentions Hakkar. 
---
He is only referred to as a "god" or "spirit". 
---
Nowhere in the books is the word "Loa" mentioned (if we can trust the book-dump linked above). 
---
ICC was awesome. Naxx was awesome for those who did not experience it before (probably the overwhelming majority of players).
---
Guys, those keybind options are absolutely horrible. Maybe I should start a thread about this, but it seems like my post went in that direction. I don't understand people who use ''1'' to ''='' for PvP, it simply doesn't make sense. Bind your keys around ASWD like I do. You can't strafe and cast, but you can still strafe by holding the right click button of the mouse. Then you bind it all around with QERFCX (Z if you want) and the Shift equivalent of all of them. Then you bind 234 with the shift equivalent as well and 1 without its shift equivalent otherwise you need to lift your hand. You can extend to 5TGVB, but it's not Optimal and their shift equivalent can be used to rebuff or something. Anyway, personally I don't understand people who keybind 6 for example, you can't keep your hand on ASWD... That's plain bad. Good Luck :P.
---
Best one so far
---

---
When you're with the bois in blue,the BG wins will come to you.
---
Really?   That's kind of awesome news!  Is it due to lack of special attacks?
---
Well, at least he's not charging
---
Yup. 
---
Is that on this subreddit? I believe I missed that
---
Look at you mr AardwarkSepiroth420 with your fancy name. /s
---
I would love nothing more than if Blizzard were to release post-Naxx level 60 content for Classic!
---
So you are not gonna give me the option to prove how bad enhancements are?
---
Are you by any chance religious and when someone asks you what makes you believe in god you ask them to prove he doesn't exist?
---
I'm 5
---
I still try this in retail and it fails every time. Feelsbadman
---
I'd rather have his bad ideas than shit stains like you representing the community. jesus fuck guy.
---
Noone ever has said that though. You need to first differentiate betwen assignments/roles and classes to be able to understand what I tried to explain.
---
Lol or perhaps it was because I was always online :(
---
Lol, wrong sub to have this discussion. Circlejerk opinions only please.
---
Because the differences between speedrunning in bfa and vanilla are vastly different, i have no interest in reading people talking about bfa content, the first thing i saw when reading the general was people talking about monks, dk and some other retail shit.
---
Yeah it may have been a few days ago but I think I saw it yesterday. It was the character that’s addicted to crack and the caption said, “Please blizzard just give me on little blue post” or something. 
---
I understand completely what you mean but what you don't understand is pvp.
---
I think the part when you first get to Stranglethorn and begin fighting in the arena is the best part, so many unique models and cool gear!
---
LMAOO
---
Mage + Priest was super fun back in the day. We'd AoE farms in Hillsbrad and the graveyard/cathedral in Scarlet Monastery. Mage just runs in and Arcane Explosions while the priest casts heals. Used to pull the SM Cathedral in 3 pulls. Was fun times.
---
Hiding as druid around the dueling areas of opposite faction and moonfiring that last bit of health from the loser...
---
Druids are GOAT flag carrier in WSG and one of the hardest healers to kill. If you can't decide between healing and DPS in PvP, you can do both with a druid. You just won't be the best at either, but it allows a lot of versatility. 
---
Hunters and Warlocks often have similar roles in PvP, but I am biased towards Warlock.
---
There is a weekly LFG pinned post for Monday's for guild recruitment.  Best bet is to post there.
---
&gt; Literally none has ever said you need to minmax.
---
Instead of helping newcomers and casuals they say things like, "Nah, you'll definitely want to roll troll &amp; heal so you can get invited to raid groups and guilds before you can start PvPing." 
---
It's pretty annoying.
---
yeah i am going to make one on the next monday post, was just throwing this out there as feeler beforehand
---
Blizzard has stated they would be willing to kill addons that affect the community or automate the game like the ones you describe. I hope they do indeed follow through on that.
---
I'm 100% confident this will exist and cause issues.  
---
I was sick one summer growing up and basically moved my xbox into the bathroom. Does that count?
---
Learn2backdoor rogues
---
No, it's never been a thing on pservers and it won't be a thing in classic.
---
Vanilla gear is all over the place, some of the pre raid BiS items are lvl 40 blues, such as thrash blade.
---
Actually there is a limited amount of guilds that are tryhards and even less that are the top. Some people from those guilds could be disgusted seeing unmaxed hunter pet without a Whiskas flask. In the mean time my guild has a PTSD from ***I am rejuvenated! You are terminated!*** and twin emps to some extent.
---
As you said, Vanilla itemization makes it so ilvl doesn't mean anything. If a pug raid leader is inviting people based solely on ilvl, just don't join as they probably don't know what they're doing. Also, I highly doing current retail players will be the majority in Classic, so this shouldn't be a issue.
---
Guy above you just gave you really strong advice that can be applied perfectly to the situation you described. Let it sink in a bit. Try it out first a couple of times in a situation like that. A statement like "X should only be used when Y" are rule of thumbs for beginners.
---
The Mage didn't do anything wrong there, it was you who could have stepped up and form a cohesive fight plan for the pulls, instead of sticking with the known/standard style, which doesn't use the Mages superiour firepower at all.
---
Oddly enough, this inspired me to finally have and play. Started a few days after this first aired.
---
Wait is blackrock spire part of the blackwing lair release? So stage 3? 
---
You will sell your flask to tryhards and get a nice capital of out their beliefs.
---
I'm #nochanges, but that's a feature I could sneak past my staunch stance.
---
Wrath baby was from the ease of Wotlk non-hardmode raids compared to the BC standard single difficulty raids.
---
No but I have a phone ;)
---
You can mute all but a single channel if you desire that way you're only notified of the conversations you're interested in.
---
Did he win though?
---
your not the target demographic, we grew up with classic wow kids nowadays grow up with fortnite/pugb/apexlegends.
---
said that too in another thread toady .incel sub.
---
Wut...
---
Half the time if youre not constantly pulling and just GOGOGO rushing through dungeons youre considered a shit tank and everyone tries to kick you or the dps start pulling. 
---
Your comment is literally an example of the mentality that he is talking about. He is going to ignore them and do his own thing, but that doesnt excuse the obnoxious behavior SOME of the min/maxers exhibit. It has nothing to do with not getting into a good guild and more to do with having to go out of his way to avoid that kind of toxic interaction. I think we can all agree that everyone should play the game the way they want to without being told that their way is shit and they should feel bad for playing like that 
---
This is a really uninformed perspective. Retail is filled with casuals right now. Theoycrafting and min-maxing has been prevelant since TBC, but it's always been the minority -- nothing has changed.
---
What I would agree with is the meter-culture has gotten worse. It's why most players can't do Heroic Tink right now as it requires them to play their class and focus on survival over DPS and HPS meters.
---
From what I understand, druids tend to be relatively under represented in raids, meaning it can be difficult to find a core raiding spot, in theory. This has it's advantages. Mainly, when you do find your spot in a raid guild, you absorb a lot of the excess gear that more optimal classes can't or don't want to use. 
---
You'll always have that hero that looks at a guide then goes "ooh guys I think I figured it out, let's try it this way"
---
First of all I'm not interested in proving you anything, since we're both not interested in convincing each other. Second I don't have any paid guides, hence I commented before 
---
&gt; **If** I wanted to be a fast leveler I would definitely buy a guide.  
---
and **if** is the keyword there.
---
And the edge I was referring to, was that if free guides point each level 20-25 alliance character to go to Duskwood and the paid guides do not point you to Duskwood at all you might or might not be more efficient in your exp/hour in a vacuum, but at least the alternative areas would be less crowded in a recently launched server scenario. And thát is where the additional value of such a guide come from simply because the paid guides would be less frequently used.
---
Lastly, I comment on you not because I think you are right/wrong, but you ask who the hell buys a guide and I provide you with this information. No need for hostility/downvotes.
---
OP are you recruiting to your guild? 
---
adotable
---
Didn't even need to /tar, you could send your pet directly to it without you losing your current target.
---
On my warlock during TBC arena I had it on a key I spammed, but I also put it in my corruption/agony/fear/etc regular binds so the pet would always be killing stuff.
---
No, just the summoned boss "Lord Valthalak"
---
Oh definitely, thank you for adding that clarification. Probably should’ve mentioned the different spec’s for each class here as well
---
The problem is there's a line. The type of person that doesn't care about consumlbes is the same person who won't care as much about the performance of their character. Nothing wrong with them, but if you put a collection of people together that don't have the ability to push themselves, there's little hope of pushing progression content.
---
You want to play with people that care because the alternative yields to a lot of wasted time.
---
Most lore in classic was found through quest series, which there weren't really a lot on trolls outside of Zul farrak and sunken temple until zul gurub was added, and books you find in game in inns and quest spots. 
---
I believe the sunken temple quest about the ancient egg of the God hakkar simply calls the troll gods.. well gods. It wasn't until tbc when zul aman was released that we got the modern depiction of loa, I believe.
---
The alliance quests in the hinterlands to find sharpbeak has a lot of troll lore, the quest to find the sunken temple from a dwarf in stormwind leads you across continents discovering ancient troll lands. 
---
And of course the darkspear in tanaris sends you to find the essence of the blood of hakkar and destroy him pre zul gurub, or at least stop his children's reanimation. All very fun quest lines.
---
triggering role players, never better m8. U?
---
No. If people think that because something is 60 and purple it automatically makes it better than a pre-60 blue then they're clueless and should be avoided at all costs. This knowledge will quickly kill the gearscore crowd.
---
Vanilla will exist in the form of Classic, since they are taking the 1.12 data backup they had and using that on the modern back end to create WoW Classic. Balancing specs would require modifying that 1.12 Vanilla data they are using, which is analogous to repainting over the Mona Lisa.
---
Like others are saying, Heals and DPS is always a good combo cause you can pull a lot and have a ton of up time. However, it’s really only worth it you are ALWAYS playing together. Having to solo level with any heal spec is reeeeeally slow and boring. And you can’t really afford to respec a lot cause those costs get away from you quick. 
---
My advice would be to think about what your ideal combo at 60 would be and shoot for that. Really, any two characters will have a fine time leveling together. People solo level all the time just fine. 2 of any class  will be fine. Just play what’s fun for you !
---
Ha he claims he did but idk...
---
If we dont want it as a community, refuse to raid with people that do it.  It will wither and die.
---
Ohh yeah, I remember now.  I didn't play Everquest, but I read about it, and that was short for mesmerize, right?  I assume that's what incapacitate in WoW is a copy of, considering how WoW devs were hardcore Everquest and, I think, Dark Age of Camelot players.
---
You could have a macro that you spammed, but the real lazy way was to just have that same thing in front of all your spells so that it automatically did it anytime you cast a spell. 
---
Oh that's kind of weird. So this quest is the exact quest to get your .5 upgrades? 
---
Very good tips especially the last one. People generally are too conservative when it comes to tanking 5mans/10mans on trash especially.
---
The conservative slow style is good for beginners to feel out the game, but once you get more geared and experienced you should look for faster ways to clear dungeons w/o trying to skip everything.
---
Doing dungeons slowly and too conservatively also has indications on playstile/server culture. People started to "skip" more and more trash packs over the years, thinking it makes the runs more efficient.
---
Well guess what, if you would clear it better and more aggressively you would do everything faster, get more gold/loot/(xp) and you didn't have to awkwardly skip anything. Also means you don't have to be one of these guys who reserve loot but can just do the dungeon twice in a row.
---
I actually think pubg is a good game. That’s likely because I liked dayz and that style of games. Fortnite and apex took it in a really different direction that seems subjectively worse to me. But I guess the kids love it. I don’t think I would’ve loved those games as a kid though. 
---
You are 100% wrong
---
Spending hours outside the raid to save minutes inside the raid is beyond stupid. Consumables and world buffs have a place, if you can't kill the bosses without them. Given how easy most bosses are they're rarely necessary.
---
No NOT tell me what to do.
---
:D
---
I find if I simply bind the F1 - F5 keys it's okay. Could you bind CTRL + in classic?  
---
How about you don't tell me what to do. Enjoy your slow ass leveling xd
---
Cool! Good to know, because usually I’ve been searching people in the general “who” list... 
---
I still remember waiting for 5 sunders before starting dps
---
cant fuckin wait to get into STVietnam and so on
---
I thought the dynamic in p servers was interesting last time I played. Horde pugs won well over 90% of the time. But ally premades could get to the horde base quicker and win the race most of the time.
---
I wonder how it will be in classic official. I imagine the easy wall walk into the ally base won't be there at the least, and I don't know the differences in that version and 1.12
---
The Germans are saying no beta.
---
Yah, but they were added in patch 1.8 so they were in vanilla
---
No, people still judge you based on your gear though, like they always has. 
---
I'm going to be maining an UD priest but I'll also be playing sometimes with a buddy who wants to do a warrior. I was considering going druid alt to have something to play with him when we play together. I know warrior/healer is a potent combo but I didn't get into druid play until TBC.
---
In a situation where I'd only be playing a druid with a warrior buddy, would you recommend going feral for leveling just to make it that much faster to kill things? Is healing instances as a druid while leveling in feral spec viable or would it be better to put points into resto first since I'll never be soloing? 
---
I hope so, but I doubt it.
---
Rolling a dwarf hunter like 
---
[Let the people know my wisdom, fill the land with smoke](https://youtu.be/TyDQs0ajxEc)
---
I challenge anyone to play DH and not be triggered when playing any other class as they lack double jumps or gliding. All dope ass things. That being said, you are absolutely right lol. Dk less so as they at least made it more tragic than cringe. 
---
yeah we didn't enforce most of them in our raids (though they were heavily encouraged, and occasionally requested for attempts at certain bosses) but a lot of people chose to get them of their own accord for fun and cos they wanted to win dat dps meter.  i'm totally cool with that, i wanted to keep my high position on legacy logs heal meters as well haha
---
What I've seen so far on pservers is people asking you to link your 3 best items in PM. This usually tells enough about your character progression and what kind of player you are. In some guilds you get a certain amount of DKP points you start with based on the amount of pre-bis items you own, like 10 DKP for piece. Asking how many pre-bis pieces you own could be a thing as well for pug raids.
---
To be honest, I don't find item power based gating a necessarily evil thing in classic, freshly dinged lvl60 players in lvl40-50 greens should not expect a free MC ride. Unlike retail these judgements are way more approximative and player-based.
---
For real. Im on bedrest to July minimum. Clearing some backlog like you wouldn’t believe. Come onnn. Comeeee onnnnnn !!
---
How does being cutting edge in a video game raiding guild have anything to do with how you spell ? Lmfao
---
Lul. Your second sentence shows my point even better.
---
And just to be sure you at least understand this, I am not influenced by all that bullshit those people say. However, I think it might affect some potential new players in a bad way, up to the point of fearing them of playing Classic whatsoever, or equally worse, playing a character they don't want to.
---
Exactly.
---
What is the ele/enhance spell power build??
---
&gt; And probably alts. 
---
Don't forget that if you're playing a PVP server you can't roll an Alliance alt on that server. Godspeed, you traitorous bastard. 
---
It's Horde-only.
---
A level 40 quest item sword has 30.9 dps. A level 60 20 man raid 2h sword has 61 dps. 
---
Yeah. Think it over.
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
pre bears EVERY stun, impressive
---
Except that's completely disingenuous.  OP's guild farmed Naxx for **4 months** at the bleeding edge of raiding, killing as many bosses and getting as much gear as humanly possible in that time span.  And they had all of AQ40 on farm well before that, whereas most guilds rolling into Naxx were still working on Twin Emps, or worse.
---
You can also bet OP's guild min/maxed on every single Naxx boss, with world buffs and consumables, until it was on farm status.  If they could forego min/maxing on KT, it was only because they got to him with almost every member of the raid already having BiS gear in every slot.
---
A casual guild might have two wings down after 4 months (if they're good), will still be struggling on some of those bosses, and will have less than a third of the gear on display in this video.
---
Its as if the Horde touched him in his "no-no" zone
---
*hovers over name, right click, enable pvp.* oof.
---
That's a decision a guild has to make as a collective.
---
Are they a 'casual' guild who aren't too concerned with pushing end game content or are they serious about making progress in raids?
---
My ex-guild had a make a decision about halfway through aq40 what we were going to do as a guild and the decision was to create a new 'casual' guild for alts or anyone who didn't want to devote time to pushing end game content. 
---
It was good to keep the two separate but we still shared the same voice comms
---
&gt; Is it to make it similar? Or maybe it's just to improve the actual game.
---
Blizz throws the word "authentic" around a LOT with Classic WOW, even if it means modern improvements aren't included.
---
So yeah, it's to make it similar
---
Many things can work. You just need to find people who want to experiment with you. For example dungeons without tanks or perhaps without healers? Even memes are viable to raids, just not optimal and very unlikely to be in the hc groups.
---
&gt; And I'll be surprised if a horde scrub like you gets past the statues haha 
---
\*takes Deeprun Tram\*
---
They're decked out in t3. Seems as though they had been doing it for a while. Hard to determine if this is TBC pre-patch. 
---
To be fair, they went back and put spell batching in even though it wasnt a thing in the Legion client.
---
The game is balanced bad. It can still be fun though.
---
Backpedaling is fine under certain scenarios. If you want to use S as another key bind more power to you but unbinding S just to avoid back pedaling is pretty dumb. 
---
Not like ur bias or anything
---
We started playing wow back in 04 as ally, we switched to the horde at BC launch (we wanted BE's) and we have not looked back.
---
       LOK'TAR OGAR!!!
---
Who is saying this? None that's who.
---
&gt; I do hate getting ganked
---
 
---
&gt;but I don’t wanna miss out on a pvp server this time round
---
Does not compute
---
I wont be playing a lock in classic, actually.
---
True but that's something that the community asked heavily for.
---
I don't think anyone is asking for sketchy macros to cheese shaman mechanics.
---
UD?
---
Let's wait and see. It'd be interesting for a mage to compete for fastest 60!
---
Well, that is a very bad try at ad hominemn.
---
Did your BG ranking premade never have any role/positioning assignments? Did your team just wing it every time and people randomly scatter around Arathi Basin w/o knowing where the other people went? Did you /roll for who carries the flag in WSG and who defends your own?
---
You must have been in a premade that just was so fucking good it didn't matter what everyone did because you would just always miraculously win w/o even the resemblance of coordination. God, what a legendary group of wildcard players you were in. I wish I could have seen it!
---
It's too late for that, sorry.
---
Gearscore was one of the downfalls of the game.  It resulted in people just slotting items with the highest GS vs trying to understand the effects of all the different stats on their DPS/heals etc.  It sucked and simplified the game.  What people enjoyed (although they were probably wont admit it), was the complexity &amp; depth of deciding what items to equip.  
---
I for one hope something like GS disappears and never comes back.  Rather invite players and check the DPS charts and see if you're successful as a group before making a player selection based purely on item level.  
---

https://images.app.goo.gl/5Jcho2YTLqvPTAq49 this one but instead of saying wow it said blue posts 
---
You gotta raise the height of those monitors (unless you're really short) otherwise you're gonna end up a hunchback.
---
Could you link a 0/30/21 spec? I'm so unfamiliar with druids I'm not sure which talents the spec should take
---
&gt; I’m an alliance at heart and he’s a horde at heart.
---
So you're saying you owe your friend some thanks for showing you the right path.
---
No, the only people that matter play horde.
---
Well said Frank, BIG thumbs up!
---
ps: You should check my profile, speaking of dwarves.
---
Whos watching the intro?
---
I always love seeing the pre blind abolish poisons too
---
You don't understand my point at all.
---
You are trying to group classes into specific roles. I am saying that each class has is so unique they forfill they own role. The Flagcarry is a druid. It's not this group of 3 different possible classes.
---
The warrior is the warrior. There's no classes that replace warriors, there's none else who is the frontier. 
---
Grouping classes doesn't make sense when they each forfill they own unique roll itself, so instead of calling it "the frontier", just call it the warrior because that is what it is.
---
But regardless of how casual you want to be, people don’t want to wipe on the same content for hours. That wall might hit every guild at a different time, but when you hit it, those doing less get blamed.
---
so you linking a vid of a tryhard guild (back then they were considered tryhard) and then title your post "you dont need to min/max). kinda defeating your own point?
---
also noone ever said you have to tryhard to clear naxx. especially not tryhard guilds cause they realy dont care how casuals play the game. i do like to minmax and i dont care how you play the game as long as you are not in my guild. i just want you to not tell me how to play. i like to min/max. you like to play as casual. play the game as you like. end of storry
---
*counters cheapshot with orc passive and kills me*
---
guy goes on level 1 pally in northshire 2 min later: “lol dont play on a pvp server”
---
actually happened btw
---
acts like rtz, GG IM DONE get me OUT DOF THIS GEMAE after dying once
---
Classic is going to fail, it is way overrated! :V
---
So it's treason then
---
Mages have to drink though with a healer or not. 
---
A warrior + healer combo never has to stop ever again. Just give the priest the last hit and he has full mana always.
---
Shaman puts down WF totem and the warrior proceeds to oneshot mobs his own level.
---
Paladins autoattack anyways, so they can spare a heal once in a while.
---
Killing last boss in Naxx without world buffs, flasks and other consumables. 
---
Wow, you are a sad person.
---
I’m beyond confused.  You shit on people who are expecting a blue post every week, then proceed to tell blizzard we NEED updates and a release date.  Lol 
---
They will release Classic WoW on June 25th or July 2nd. My reason. FFXIVs expansion comes out on July 2nd and goes into early access on June 28th.
---
I get your general point, but the Thrash Blade is definitely not pre-raid BiS.
---
Everyone making this clueless point that "because vanilla gear is all over the place you can't use Ilvl", which is just plain wrong.
---
Instead of using Ilvl you just use something that's more fit. I could spend an afternoon and I'd have a list of the efficient power level of every item, and instead of using Ilvl, you use that.
---
But no, people don't do it, they do say stuff like "I'm prebis" or "I'm 3 pieces off prebis", and if you are a healer you say "i have this much healing power and this much mana", or spellcaster you just say spellpower. 
---
if a rogue and mage are equal in skill, the rogue will never catch the mage. see what you need to do is have the warrior charge, they blink, then you cheap/kidney and kill cus they already blinked
---
Good good, just checking you're trolling and it's not actually a cry for help. 👍
---
Which guild is that?
---
Idk, i see it as a product of what the game was at the time.  Theyve said many times before that things are going to be implemented how they were back then 'for better or worse' to give the authentic experience.  Cherry picking a few things that were bad while not fixing others would really set a bad precedent.  
---
If shammies get immunity to totems being easily destroyed in PvP, why shouldnt shadow priests get better mana regen in PvE?
---
The debuff limit (which didnt exist in legion) also had to be added back in, which hurts quite a few specs.  
---
Theres just so many things that were fixed later to make things equal/easier/better/whatever, but thats not the Classic experience.
---
I think every mage is very aware of that from killing ourselves like that multiple times. 
---
Exactly! I was about to reply the same thing. Two different types of player communities entirely there. And there's room for all of them. Some will push progression, some won't. Some will want to learn the game slowly and eventually push progression, some will stagnate and be happy with what they have achieved. In the end, if they're having fun and enjoying the content, that's all that matters.
---
For the Alliance, Hail to Blue Flags!
---
That's just like, your opinion, man.
---
Alliance for classic, horde for retail.  That's my plan b/c it's what I did.  I played alliance in vanilla then quit till end of mop and came back and played horde.  I plan to keep it that way (not the least of which reason is I main pally).
---
Always level as Feral. Make sure to keep all +int gear you find so you can have a second set for healing dungs et cetera.
---
Eventually you'll have to respec into Resto if you're going to heal dungs post 45-50 or so. 
---
&gt;I want to roll a shaman, talk me out of it?
---
If you find normal StormStrike based Enhancement not to your liking, you can do a 21/30 enhancement shaman based on elemental type procs. SP and the 21'st ele talent point Elemental Fury Scales flametounge, searing totem,  and trinket/weapon procs like darkmoon card maelstrom &amp; heart of wrymthalak.  Its possible to make a true hybrid melee ele shaman that uses int/SP to scale your melee as well as shocks.  Hand of Edward the Odd with free CL/LB/Healing waves too would be massively beneficial.
---
Plenty of room for **SCIENCE**^^tm
---
I appreciate the concern.
---
We have something in common then, thumbs up!
---
Warlocks killed you? Poly the lock, kill pet, poly lock, drink. Combat hopping is crazy easy as a mage.
---
I'm fairly certain that iLvL and gearscore won't exist because it doesn't really make tons of sense in Vanilla.
---
That said, I'm fairly certain some sort of equivalent to Raider.io will pop up for end game dungeon runs/pug raids....which makes me sad.
---
i personally just hate rogues. theyre usually chicken shit players so u can assume if a rogue+ anybody else on their faction is around, theyll attack you. and if nobody is around, theyll either try to 1v1 u and fail n run, or just avoid you. but rogues are 100% the most aggressive players
---
Check my profile speaking of dwarves.

Is there supposed to be one?
---
of course! Devouring Plague, Will of the Forsaken PLUS I get to look like a Zambie :D

You should have read the entire thread

---
https://imgflip.com/i/2xudy1 no showing up for some reason 
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
More like "Please announce the release date..."
---
They are not going back for better or for worse, they are keeping bug fixes and I presume they would see the macros like that being a bug fix as it wasn't an intended mechanic to use macros to deal with totems.
---
Very nice...!!
---
Okay, maybe if the warlock is leveling with a voidwalker then this is possible, otherwise the felhunter has very high spell resistance and can instantly remove polymorph from the warlock
---
Your points on poor PvE performance damage wise still stands, especially if Classic is set in stone with 1.12 balance where WF suffered two major nerfs; 50% less AP bonus and can't chain off itself with a 3s internal CD.
---
Keep Goldshire Inn Weird.
---
Same here, buddy. Some of my friends refuse to play Alliance, and it's more important for me to play together than to play my faction. I fucking hate Orgrimmar though, Ironforge for life. 
---
People who played a lot during vanilla are probably less likely to come back than people who only played a little bit (like myself). I never got to raiding for example so I obviously have a lot I want to go back and try. If you did it all back in vanilla I could imagine you would be less inclined to do it all again. 
---
Precious??? Nnnnnoooooooo!!!!
---
Majority of warlocks I encountered kept their succubus, of course then the problem is seduction. The spell resist is a problem on the fel hunter but it isn't going to stop you if you manage to get the poly off and keep it away from the lock.
---
Just one little blue post will tide me over baby please...
---
welcome
---
I did this from the UK playing on nostralia. I needed to playing during the day rather than the evenings and worked well for me with raids starting in the morning and finishing by midday.
---
Latency wasn't great (around 200ms IIRC) but wasn't a problem for me as DPS.
---
On horde a 2h Fury warrior (especially orc with racial +axe) will be far far superior in that role, and for raw uptime, a hunter spamming wing clip is the best, even tho that honestly too is a waste of a slot imo.
---
Best situation for Nightfall is literally just give one of your 2h fury warrior off-tanks Wf totem and the uptime and DPS provided will be great.  A shaman has the worse uptime for nightfall procs.
---
While I agree they are the most aggressive, they aren't necessarily "bad" players. A lot of very good players want all the advantages they can get, and just want to watch the world burn.
---
Pretty cool how rogues with stunlocking and stealth even exist. Blizz really just wanted to feed the chaos!
---
The last 3 blue posts were Thursday(spell batching), Friday(loot sharing), Monday(AV). It doesn't seem they have a scheduled release. Also worth noting AV and loot sharing were on the same week even. 
---
I'll second that motion! We move to push the proposal forward.
---
I get PTSD from memories of pulling the 3 dark iron dwarves 
---
it's impossible to poly a warlock with a felhunter on the field
---
That explains it.  
---
Dirty!
---
NF Shaman ironically is best used in PvP with conjunction of an Ele shaman.  Run in with NF and SS a target and hope the Nightfall proc also lands. With both multiplicative debuffs on a target they are setup to be instantly killed by a Chain lightning / Lightning bolt.
---
If WF and NF proc on the alliance target doesn't proc, at worst case the ele shaman is still getting an absurd damage boost from SS.  If the Enh shaman does get a WF proc and NF proc on the target, a non-crit Earth Shock is still hitting for ~1k non-crit, enough to kill most players.
---
Not sure what the other guy was pointing towards. But if a large portion of this sub was 6-10 years old during vanilla, it would explain some of the, uhm, interesting opinions people have about the game. Like all the "I can't wait to do Deadmines again, best dungeon ever!". Or all the people wanting to play ret pala or whatever (yes you can and are allowed to, but it sucks, why do you want to?). 
---
It's in the top 3 MH weapons for rogues and the difference isn't that big.
---
Dalrend set &gt; Krol blade &gt; thrash blade
---
And it's in the top 5 for warriors MH or OH depending on their other weapon
---
Good vid!
---
Imagine classic on proper retail servers with smooth and constant FPS, latency, todays resolutions support, properly scripted etc. 
---
Can't wait! :3
---
My biggest concern is the release date. I have a planned vacation for two weeks at the beginning of July, so if blizz decides to live classic on July 16 then I'll probably miss it and I'll literally kill myself If I do. I have too big plans on classic and I want to be there when the History begins 
---
Meh that sounds like a bug!
---
It’s literally reliant on wall jumping, it’s not going to be in classic. Why do you people comment without knowing what you’re talking about.
---
I just wanna know when it is so I can let my work know when I’m going on my vacation.
---
Played rogue in vanilla and Druid in BC to now. Really struggling to decide between playing HOTW Druid or 30/0/21 shaman. 
---
I wanna pug dungeons/raids as a healer, and do a lot of PvP (I’m an ex mythic raider who no longer has the schedule flexibility to join a guild and raid, but I can still play a lot). Anyone have tips on making this decision? 
---
Scuba Cops
---
People downvoting you that have no idea what the skip even is.
---
I have done this one! It's hilarious
---
Edit: not counting teebus as it way too rare/expencive to get reliably 
---
yes! they tend to be the scummiest players so i target rogues specifically too
---
It's funny... my friend asked me to post this for him instead of creating an account.  
---
I told him to just create an account but now I completely understand why someone who doesn't reddit wouldn't want to.  How hard is it to just scroll past a post?
---
Dang ol paladins
---
Devour magic is what a 6 second cd, heals the fel hunter? I'm assuming you frost nova both of them, casting sheep instantly afterwards. Which takes priority to remove?
---
In 5 man instances where shamans are allowed to drink, they can provide extremely good burst damage and overall DPS where mana is not a limiting factor.
---
Granted, a WF totem and heals with a heavily stacked melee dungeon 5/10 man group is still the best way to go in terms of clear speed.
---
I vaguely remember this. You could do it with blink too at some point
---
There are probably still some 16-20 year old who play retail WoW. No 11-15 year olds though. 
---
Aside from maybe a bit more in the 30+ range I think this matches pretty well with the retail WoW playerbase as well. Although I have no data to back that up obviously, just my own experience in retail. 
---
Nice!! I love next level stuff like this
---
On the contrary, Druids bring a lot of utility with HoTs and battle rezzes. They also have Decurse/Abolish Poison for particular fights meaning theres always room for druids in raids. As for gear goes, Druids are one of the most under-played classes meaning you will have a good shot of earning tier set gear when raiding. you will find some competition with the other items like neck/weapon pieces, but it won't be too bad and most raids will run on a DKP system so if you earned the item, you get it. I played resto druid in vanilla and got my tier 1 and tier 2 sets pretty easily. RNG is a big factor, but i wasn't havent to compete with others for the gear often.
---
TBC was peak wow.  Its been downhill ever since.
---
no, not all of them are bad but typically, they are. the main reason ill be playing mage is to counter hungry rogues
---
Okay. 
---
Agreed, I have two weeks I can use whenever. I would like to take time off as well. I cant believe that Blizzard still doesn't seem to be taking classic as seriously as we are.
---
As you have demonstrated quite well
---
yass!!! DP is too op
---
An off-tank 2h fury warrior with a WF totem is the best uptime and overall DPS with a nightfall.  With 2 2h melee warriors in a group with WF, nightfall will have significant uptime on bosses while both warriors will still be able to deliver significant melee dps.
---
Still points back to in a raid PvE scenario, shamans are best used as melee support/healers.
---
I’m gonna be one DAMN good looking Dwarf, that’s for sure!
---
no world buffs...
---
yea it is gorgeous the level he outplays
---
This is Stormreaver. You guys were top of the Alliance always cutting edge raiding as I remember.
---
That looks great! I confess I'm gonna miss goblin glider from retail.
---
Guess I'm rolling mage again to learn how to Spell 
---
And without optimal class composition or class/race selection 
---
I remember doing this in AB to run from losing fights with dot classes, since it would break slowfall
---
Didn‘t see that one cumming 
---
Hhhmmm, let's examine.  
---
You said:
---
&gt; I don't think anyone has ever claimed you need to minmax to play the game and clear content. 
---
He said:
---
&gt;\[min/maxers\] will tell you that you can't do anything past BWL with offspecs, without BiS and consumes...  they will even tell you that you should be ashamed to not minmax, because it's not respectful for the other people of the raid. Also that you won't find anyone to play with, bla, bla, bla. 
---
Why bother saving for "college" 99% of 18 year olds have no idea what they want to do. Hit up community college for two years and figure shit out. 
---
I was blessed to have parents who did the exact same thing your doing. Wasted 50k for two years of "school" ended up in a trade union. Not knocking you, as I literally had the same done for me, but i would highly recommend going to community for two years before spending vast amount of cash. Unless your wealthy beyond all means

Good luck to you!

I'm rolling priest, so I'm sure I'll meet a few at least!
---
I'm in the same situation! I keep telling myself it may work out in our favor because the server stability will be shaky at first, but improve enough that by the time I can take PTO, I won't have to worry about unscheduled downtime.
---
In other words, I'm becoming delusional about this release.
---
There's no such thing as polymorphing a warlock. And felhunters, unlike a succubus, cannot be killed by a mage
---
Agreed, they were pretty much top dog on Alliance. Shout out to Stormreaver, my OG realm. 
---
well, if you want to clear releases day1 you better come prepared.
---
you can obv. achieve the same kind of power for dps checks by just farming the easy bosses for upgrades?
---
Rogue.
---
Ya it's really strong. Can easily be dispelled in PvP but most Alliance were too dumb to think of that lol. 
---
&gt; who made people perfect Naxxramas on a PTR before it even came out.
---
And &lt;Return&gt; did the exact same thing but they weren’t as good. Are you forgetting that Return cleared Naxx in what, 2h30, when it launched? That’s still much faster than the other top guilds. 
---
This is not how this meme works.
---
Spring just hit.  We are 3-6 months from launch.  Stop.
---
Rogue. 
---
But then that's the guilds decision to take dead weight with them or not wouldn't you agree? Eventually the dead weight is dropped for others who want to pull their weight and the non-interested party can go do something they're interested in. If a person wants to play with a bad build and intentionally not change, that's their prerogative I suppose
---
Priests can solo every humanoid trash part of any dungeon (but not bosses).
---
Mind control, let that mob attack till one is dead, exit instance, enter dungeon, rinse repeat.   Solo priest stockade runs for wool make great bank at early game.
---
Beautiful! Some of these are fuckin rude lol
---
The first issue is that that cap is *way* too high. Vanilla was designed around a soft limit of around 2500 (but could go up to 3500 worst case scenario). To add more people to that will start degrading the experience. The economy will be a wreck, it will be near impossible to do any world content without half a dozen people trying to tag your same mob, and *good luck* finding any of the end game resources for your crafting needs.
---
The second issue is that's just not how the majority of players' minds work. Say you show someone, a Horde player, two servers; one of these servers says "Alliance Side Full, Only Horde May Create a Character Here." and another server that doesn't say that, he's most likely going to choose the one that *doesn't say that*. Why? Because the other server is clearly FULL of Alliance and the other isn't. History of WoW servers show us that players flock to one-sided population servers more often than not. What are you going to do, *force* him to roll on that server?
---
That's not how any of this works
---
They should work their way through every expansion and keep the same lore, but keep gameplay and mechanics the same as Classic. The way WoW should have been today.
---
aww...poor guy.
---
You mean those polls done on Reddit, where every discussion about RP-PvP servers is filled with "I loved RP-PvP servers, there were so many world PvP battles there", "The community there was so mature", "I want to take things more slowly".
---
There is reason why in Europe and NA, the only surviving RP servers (a.k.a. those that still have huge RP community) are PvE (or were, prior to addition of Warmode).
---
Give me poll that is advertised on RP forums and media instead of Classic subreddit. Let´s see what the results are when you ask actual roleplayers.
---
butthurt or what?
---
Found the toxic people!
---
Stand down there Red Ranger
---
I’ve to see those straw men anywhere on this sub. 
---
WOTLK by far
---
That would be neat, yeah. 
---
The Pallyenvy is real :( 
---
the gear naxx has is like 2-3times better than 90% of any loot you can get elsewere, having half a raid with naxx gear after 2-3 lockouts even if its only 20ish items or so split over the raid is ALOT compared.  thats where wroldbuffs come in handy for day1 pushes.
---
Lore? Let's just call it a different timeline. People love multiverse theories.
---
Still faster than pally leveling
---
Does anyone else thing private servers are the worst?? We get it, you spent 30+ hours a week in Naxx to get KT down. The game and the players have evolved. People are going to min max and clear Naxx in a week, I don’t see why that’s such a bad thing. 
---
"it made most sense for what we want to do" - what is that then? Live in huts made out of twigs and clay? Slowly rot away?

"Oh if only we could figure out the incredible secret as to how to put one stone on top of the other and make a house!" - every Horde ever

You are just innovative.  100% counts
---
Lol.   Oh just multibox wity a bal druid, youll be fine
---
Maybe if we wish hard enough...
---
My friends want to go Alliance, but I'm leaning towards Horde for something new. Like an Orc Warlock or Tauren/Troll Shaman.
---
Probably just gonna go what I want.
---
They are located in one place (per region). You can check ping here:
---
 [https://pingtestlive.com/world-of-warcraft](https://pingtestlive.com/world-of-warcraft) 
---
All those streamers play alliance because their bad at the game and more than half of them play dumb strength classes like warrior and paladin. Aka alliance sucks man. You'll be happy with horde edge lords. 
---
Dunno, how hard is it to type "new content" into the search bar?
---
I use a steering wheel to turn, floor pedals for forward and backwards. This way, you have the entire keyboard available to rebind.
---
The mean imaginary strawmen. 
---
If you want to pug dungeons/raids and still do PVP without having to switch specs, I think Shaman would slightly edge out Druid in this case. An elemental shaman would give you the ability to fill in raids better because Chain Heal and totems.
---
1st world problems
---
Why is that so important? Will the first six months not one big blob of equal freshness anyways? I would be somewhat pissed if I knew they delayed the release just to cater to ppl’s vacation plans...
---
Horde for the travel options and flight paths, obviously.
---
and you just reminded me that the old noggenfogger /scared would make you stand up straight like a skeleton, but on live it just makes you cower like the regular animation
---
I total agree with you on that, I have my own grudges when it comes to World buffs though, honestly. Most recent major private servers have released content patches with World buffs disabled for the first month of a raid tier being out to give hardcore guilds a bit of a challenge. 
---
This is an amazing satire post.
---
Blizzard announced Legion on this day a year ago. Legion was dued for August 14. Seeing we don't have a release date yet, we do know that it is coming this summer. I think it's reasonable to assume that the most early release will be the beginning of July and the latest would be the end of August. Im sure most of you can work around that and July is still 3 months off. That's a lot of time still as a 6 week in advance notice seems sufficient for taking a week or two off.
---
Remember that you can still use time off effectively later on. If you can only get a week off when you're already level 40, that's just gonna make the 40-60 journey better. Already 60? Run the shit out of some dungeons.
---
If anything, time off at launch while everyone is fighting against each other to level is probably the *worst* time to take time off work (even though it's exactly what I'm gonna do). 
---
I'd say the tryhard, would be the guy pushing content without consumes, just to make some gold.  To each his own though.
---
You will get more than a months notice.  I know that even some people need to put in 60 days or even 90 beforehand, but you will certainly get a month at the very least.  I say they give us a three month launch date
---
not in my region. All episodes are free and available
---
Which one is it? You can't pick both. There is no Sweden.
---
Dis alliance OP sounds butthurt... zug zug
---
Agreed. To add onto this, putting a hard faction cap is a very bad design decision. Imagine you have 2 friends that want to star WoW with you, so naturally you tell them to come to your realm. Turns out there's only 1 Horde spot left (spots being 1 unique character per account per realm per faction). Your 2nd friend will be left out.
---
Naturally speaking, almost every realm at one point was more or less 50/50 split. Sometimes 40/60, sometimes 60/40 etc.  But more or less in the middle.
---
The reason why later on you got realms which are like Alliance dominant or Horde dominant was after the rise in character transfers, but mostly the free transfers from high pop realms to low pop. A lot of guilds used this to migrate and form unions with other guilds from other realms. This had a snowball effect which left a lot of realms almost empty.
---
Additionally, some realms almost became language-oriented. Stormreaver EU being a full Finnska fest, and Defias Brotherhood EU being the 2nd land of the Pollocks (no offence meant!).
---
Also there was a guy on here with a red username that kept saying that Vanilla realms were capped at 10k, which is totally false lol.
---
8k would be fun, but it would honestly require dynamic respawns, which isn't bad, just not blizzlike. A more reasonable cap would be 5k. With that being said, 10k servers were so much fun; the world was alive anywhere you went. I personally would enjoy higher caps 8-10k, but I feel like 5k would be best for the game.
---
What you say about balancing servers is a pretty good idea. I hope they can figure out a way to balance the server factions, so we won't have to deal with crbgs and the detriment they caused to server community.
---
Interesting, was there ever anything about why they made the change - I played Alliance back then, never knew about the music in Brill.
---
Also a similar function is still in the game, the ticks were just way faster so they basically slowed it down to imitate how it was in vanilla.
---
Personally I'm waiting on Mk 11 but that entirely depends on when classic gets a release date.
---
I don’t get what you mean. I’ve played most of the raids at 60 on private servers and I still think dungeons are fun. I’m more of an SFK guy myself. I’d also argue, people who played back then know how bad those specs could be at times, so they have the forethought to not do that. 
---
Meanwhile, people who have never played the game are more likely to play a “meme spec” just out of a lack of knowledge. 
---
Id also argue that younger people are more of the min/max crowd, compared to the older folks who just want to enjoy it their way. It’s fine either way, I’m a little bit of both, but I tend to find most people my age are all about doing everything to the nth degree and eking out every damage point they can. 
---
I searched for Morgans plot as well as my friend.
---
I've been playing Standard version level 20 and just wandering around doing as much stuff as my character is capable of doing at that level. 
---
I need classic ASAP!
---
Sounds like, but the more skilled rogues were able to pull it off consistently. A buddy of mine said recently that he would spend hours in AV picking fights with casters so he could practice vanishing their cc. 
---
A similar function yes, but they didn't just slow it down, in retail there's a priority system, so that you can't do the common spell batching tricks.
---
Not Vanilla, but I did this on my DK (Path of Frost, IIRC) to my raid in ToC and killed most of them when we fell down below to Anub.
---
I received a lot of hate for that one.
---
I like what you're going for here. Might I recommend "Skirmishers" for Rogues/Druids instead of Duelists? It fits well and avoids potential confusion with actual duels which you point out.
---
Hmm interesting thought. Have they targeted competitor release dates in the past?
---
&gt;he’s not gonna be full pre raid bis by week 2
---
Oh lmao?
---
When you're a Nelf in Shadow Meld and a Horde almost walks too close to your bush...
---
The gearscore mentality from LK has been replaced by the preraid-Bis mentality on pservers.
---
a good lock named raft showed me several tricks like this in dm, but yeah works all over wow
---
Dial it back about 20% there Super Chief. Your best best is taking time off once you're 60, you can either use that time to get your pre-raid BiS, commit to ranking hard or farming and acquiring a small fortune.
---
I only played WoW briefly during TBC, but the patch that introduced the Isle of Quel'danas is where the game really lost me. I was in a fairly casual raid guild at the time and it was like, why bother trying to make progress through SSC when I can just mindlessly do dailies to get weapons that are way better than what I can get from raiding.
---
Plus the dailies were boring as hell. But you had to do them if you wanted to progress.
---
Hated it. I got my weapons and then never played WoW again until Nostalrius.
---
Some serfer caps  should atleast be 3.5k as it was present in vanilla. Maybe do some to 4k. Think 4k max would be perfecr on some realms
---
Naxx was great it's only problem was how severely undertuned it was. Even blizzard admitted they undertuned it.
---
Man, I love this one. It's so in sync with Warcraft III Undead campaign song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tb2lPxvvKU
---
How do I get in on this talent build
---
You say everyone but I didn’t even have that 😂👌🏻
---
Same here with &lt;Orc Forge&gt;. We're gonna string you gomes up and hang ya from Orgrimmar.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19870
---
Comments like this is why your entire faction is perceived as toxic. It comes off like an edgy teenager. 
---
Problem here is you playing versus really bad warlocks then.
---
im usually in the discord classic wow server under And
---
u gotta silence while i dp so it doesnt get dispelled!
---
Anyone else hoping TBC servers come out after?
---
Factions aren´t at war in Vanilla. Actual war only started in Cata, until then, it was just minor skirmishes between sub-factions (Warsong, Frostwolf, Stormpike, people from Stromgarde), with only big factions participating in faction conflict in the lore being Forsaken (as Defilers) and night elven Sentinels (and they were defenders in WSG).
---
Now, in terms of how RP works, PvE server offers far better conditions for it than PvP. One obvious reason is that bunch of PvPers can´t gank you in their BiS gear while you are doing your event in RP gear (because no transmog, so you need to wear the actual piece).
---
Second is that much of RP happens outside of the game world. Let´s do an example. Group of mages goes on to a quest to find artifact stolen from Stormwind by powerful human warlock. They go to Duskwood where he has been hiding ever since and start fighting him.
---
Now, because you can´t really pop in enemies into the game, this bad guy is represented by raid marker or by person creating the event. The warlock managed to summon bunch of demons of all kinds (another markers) and our mages are now fighting for their lives. Battle is done through emotes and maybe people also use /roll to determine how successful they are.
---
Then three orcs show up, kill the mages, magically run right through the line of demons and one-shot the warlock protected by impenetrable shield, because in-game, he was level 30.
---
PvE servers offer protection against griefing that is often crucial to RP. If this situation happened on PvE server, those three orcs couldn´t do anything and the only disruption they would provide to the event would be their presence (possibly right in the line of demons).
---
Long story short, RP happens outside of the game (but still in the world, if you get what I mean) and PvE servers are way better at representing this than PvP ones (not to mention that you can still do RP-PvP on PvE servers, but it´s organized and consented by both parties).
---
Yeah those bad warlocks prepping for rogue saps and warrior charges in random encounters in the world. 
---
Oh I’m sorry I hurt the sacred meme code. 
---
Friends don't let friends play alliance.
---
Ah, but ofc. On those! Silly me, not knowing everything about every private server out there. 🙄
---
Just one RP-PVP server would suffice tbh.
---
Well it 100% is a pre raid bis.  I got lucky enough to find a krol blade but would have used my thrash until I won the dal rends over one of the very many melee in ubrs who also want it.  
---
yea priests are tough cus you lack the mana to kill stuff if ur not specced into damage, i remember 1v1ing this warrior my level and i would oom before killing him, only having used mana for damage not healing
---
You should learn what best in slot means
---
We rarely had a full 40 man raid. Most guilds are going to take any and all members of the guild for every raid. The only issue you'll run into is being forced into a healing role, possibly competing for gear if there are more druids, and the fact that you don't have a reliable res for 5-mans.
---
Yup and removed priorities 
---
Horde always.
---
As far as I have heard/read about, world  buffs were utilized by guilds who were competing for world-first progression. I haven't seen anything that they were used extensively by the majority of raiding guilds. At the time, there was much less knowledge of the game, and few "proven" methods for how to excel - it was so new and most people were still just figuring everything out.
---
It boils down to not taking Reddit's rhetoric seriously.  Half of the community constantly contradicts the other.
---
I can see it now.
---
Friday morning team scrum
---
::Ion:: Ok everyone, we are going to post the release date today. I think we are in good shape with the refactoring that Phil was doing last week. 
---
::Team Member Joe:: HOLD UP! I just peeked at Reddit and we need to make a change?
---
::Ion:: Why is that Joe?
---
::Team Member Joe:: A user named /u/Erupoean_Soccer said we wont give the launch date and he will piss himself if we don't
---
::Ion and Lore:: That would be funny to see
---
::Ion:: Ok.. don't make the post.
---
Meeting adjourns and everyone files out of the conference room.
---
::Team Member Joe:: Oh shit. . I misread that.. He will BE pissed.. . Ion?  ION?  Oh well.
---
Well the good thing is that if that occurs in classic then he/she have two subscriptions only to tell people not to play on a pvp server :)
---
Absolutely and I hope you get them, but roleplayers themselves will mostly stick to RP PvE servers because it´s far easier to do DMed events in RP gear when nobody can gank you and repeatedly /sit on your corpse while ignoring horde of undead that surrounded you (represented by raid markers).
---
Thats not at all what i thought was going on.  TIL.  Thanks!
---
You should learn how vanilla works.
---
If you think you can get the absolute BiS for every slot before the first raid, you're delusional 
---
You think this is bad? Try scheduling off time during the past when server server keeps crashing and you can't get in due to downtime. Gonna be real with you, the best thing to do is to wait a week after launch to go hard.
---
WoD taught us this.
---
The Sword Of A Thousand Truths is OP
---
The way I always see it is that it's friendly banter, just taken to different levels.  Look at it like this:
---
* If I was in an argument with my best friend and he made a great point, I could say to him *"oh, shut up, you dumb bitch,"* and we would both probably laugh.  
---
* If I was in an argument with my wife and she made a great point and I said to her *"oh, shut up, you dumb bitch,"* she would probably slap me and then start crying.
---
Alliance players are always the "wife" side of this equation.
---
My guild wiped on a few easy Naxx bosses as we were watching. It was so on point that it hurt. 
---
This is not even remotely close to true. There were realms with SEVERE faction imbalances, way before transfers were a thing. 
---
For the Alliance!
---
You realize that for  f druids, blessing of kings gives more damage then might, due to heart of the wild talent for feral. Also, salv should be number one for all dps without a threat wipe 
---
Part of the ilvl obsession, I beleive, is due to the ocean of available gear in retail.  In vanilla, items had distinct names and appearances and instead of ilvl being emphasized, it'll be certain class related standards to certain pieces of gear.
---
*RP'ing an epic battle against the opposing faction Poopstabber69 runs into the opposing faction without enabling PVP. /Spits and /lols at everyone and there's nothing they can do about it. RP killed.*
---
I play both FFXIV and WoW and in my experience they both tend to release stuff at the same time. Usually a major patch in WoW competing with an FFXIV expansion. 
---
Example FFXIV Stormblood  early access - June 16th 2017
---
Wow Patch 7.2.5 - June 13th 2017
---
They've done similar things to other competing mmos in the past like GW2 and I think even Swtor. 
---
Sick days don't require advance notice :)
---
You made the correct decision. Lok'tar ogar.
---
If you only open 2 servers per time zone, you can open and close those servers as folks register to keep the balance.  
---
Too many horde on server 1, close it until alliance fill up and then open it again.  Too many alliance on server 2, close it until horde fill up and then open it again.
---
I think folks get the point Im trying to make.  Why is it so hard to create high pop servers with horde/alliance balance.  In TBC, they have pages and pages of servers, and most those servers were a train wreck when it came to balance. 
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!   Even the gnomes smell better than anything on Horde. 
---
*ignores him like a sane human bean*
---
It's not more desired in the case of classic as every single poll about server choice shows.
---
RpPvP is more popular than Rp. Blizz should start recognizing this.
---
Does this make you lose control of the pet, or would spamming "follow" help?
---
Whiny little child it seems 
---
Oh I would like to, but that thing is an inch thick. 400 pages is just a bit more than I have time to deal with unfortunately. 
---
Is the 0/30/21 spec good enough to heal dungeons at 60 with decent gear?
---
They are just bad. Also on retail I encountered guilds that tried to bruteforce every boss, and if they couldnt, they were just calling "our ilvl is too bad, we will come next week..." despite other guilds killing it easily with 10ilvl lower... 
---
Yes, I have my guild and friends ready to play on a RpPvP server. Blizz, please don't ruin our plans and just add 1 RpPvP server.
---
Ya Silence can be really helpful for that too but if they get a single dispel off it strips the DP usually. It's a gamble and depending on how much of a panicked keyboard smasher you're fighting it may pay off. 
---
I honestly don’t see the point. If someone actually makes me hearth and go back to SW from badlands then who really won?
---
Is it really worth 10-15 min of getting back to the questing spot?? Are people that prideful????
---
Same for gouge
---
I never said anything against that. Just that you can get a better fucking weapon.
---
Blizzard will RUE THE DAY they don't align their release with your vacation!
---
I know this sounds silly. Butt.
---
Why do people want classic to be like retail when we all know retail blows haha
---
Ugh, add it after release, don't distract them. But seriously, it gives away what you're looking at, which wasn't in vanilla, so it changes gameplay.
---
&gt; The type of person that doesn't care about consumlbes is the same person who won't care as much about the performance of their character … don't have the ability to push themselves
---
I don't think that's true. Consumables take a lot of time to farm. If a player doesn't want to or can't spend the time farming them, it does not at all imply that they don't care about the performance of their character.
---
Couldn't they just see you standing there doing nothing?
---
PServers can go suck a lemon 
---
Oh certainly, I just get run speed enchant and heal myself while running away. The trick is just to not die, but I don't actually try to kill the other player lol... well, sometimes... but it's hard.
---
Since when 60/40 is "in the middle" and acceptable (as implied)? 
---
Am I missing something obvious? A 60/40 ratio is a 20% more population for the popular faction. This is nearly unplayable. I've played in 45/55 vanilla server and it was already unbearable (for both factions).
---
I know that servers with way worse ratios exist(ed) but that shouldn't be what we look up to. Vanilla is heavily about the world and anything near or (god forbid) above 45/55 should be unacceptable. 
---
While it makes sense what you say, I still think not combining Rp with PvP is a heavy loss. Not everything should be scripted and the world should have an element of surprise to it even on Rp servers.
---
Most Rp happens in the capital cities and the starting zones anyway and going out into the world should be dangerous even on a RpPvP server, that's part of the roleplay. 
---
&gt;I grew up on Illidown
---
FTFY
---
lmao yea, still fun though. i prefer to play my priest with a melee or frost mage lol
---
I am 100% certain that "loa" does not predate cata.  I am 90% certain that "loa" is a BFA invention for troll integration into the storytelling.  
---
The name needs work. 
---
only priest/paladin can dispel it anyway so, just fear them and you’re good!
---
Why would any company intentionally do something that they know is only going to disappoint their most dedicated fans?
---
The cap is players online, not created characters. I don't know what you are talking about with alts or to limit the amount of characters created. That has nothing to do with a population cap.
---
We are recruiting. Interested in joining? We have a core set of 5-7 players who are completely loyal - so that is a good start. We have experience in Vanilla and TBC raiding and are a mature but fun group of guys. All are welcome.
---
Turns out after all of these expansions in Retail, they really were the bad guys.  
---
I dont know man. Flag carrier spec as druid is pretty op. Personally i hate playing as shaman. I detest totems too. This is opinion of course as windfury proc is the bees knees. 
---
I am bias to druids but if youre already playing on horde then its a no brainer to roll a shaman if you wanna be support.
---
Elemental is god in PvP with gear. But if you want to get gear we ADVICE people to play resto in raids so there able to get gear. You are right, some people just dont want to hear the awnser and rather have some dude asking "So you want to play Ele to be strong in PvP?, sure we can bring you to raids and fill you with epics!" 
---
Esfand literally can't explain something with any brevity. Makes it hard to listen to.
---
It's an emote in wow too. Something like "&lt;me&gt; is hungry, maybe &lt;target&gt; has some food!"
---
I'm not saying you should know. I'm saying that the whole "private server has TBC quest" is all bullshit. 
---
Get new “friends “.  
---
of all the years I played especially back in Vanilla I never thought of this and now I feel dumber than usual. Thanks! (but for real haha thanks think I am going to reroll lock)
---
Huh? How would think I was getting at wanting it to be like retail? I mentioned one addition from BC as an example. Yeesh.
---
If people say I want to try XYZ. No one is stopping them.
---
But if they ask if it would work, they get an honnest awnser. Wich is sometimes not that they want to hear.
---
Sadly it is. You see of the things I \*thought\* I had remember correctly, most were absolutely wrong, meaning that I had worse than no info, I had bad info I thought was good. Wars have started for less!
---
i agree , there are reasons to use s
---
like you said to avoid back hits before you strafe
---
or to do a bery slow back walk as you dot everyone up in pvp while you have your faction i  front of you.
---
as long as a and d are not turn you are doing good lol.
---
jumping is actually  better conversation , i played hack then and there was a pozt about character movement indicating if you jump out of aoe you take more ticks than if you strafe out.
---
i could be wrong on this but the article explained it as if you strafe your location is just updated more frequently , where as if you jump oute of aoe the pole rate is not as fast so you take more damage.
---
it wasnt wow head but the main wow news site everyone used back then (not a forum)
---
Roll a 1d8.  
---
There are only 2 better pre raid weapons that you can get realistically (dalrend and krol) and even those can be hard to get early on.
---
I'd like to see you try it!
---
How is the world going to function when we all use PTO at once?
---
Order a pizza, no one shows up.
---
Go to the grocery store, nobody is there.
---
Turn on the faucet, nothing comes out.
---
Are we looking at a state of emergency?
---
Videos? Nah brah ms paint guides is where its at 
---
Yes. We know we will get 1.12 tallents and spell. Wich is the MOST BALANCED vanilla patch. 
---
Doing extra balancing for whatever reason is not something we want. You think you do, but you dont.
---
With a second account you can 
---
Ew.  
---
Does PW:S stop rage gain from incoming hits?
---
All this PvP talk is turning me on. I built my GF her first gaming PC and she is excited to play too. Hopefully I can teach her how to PvP and we can shrek people but chances are she will want to go at her own pace and play casually. Check my comment history I posted a video link to a City Raid I led back in 2007. I never recorded my raids but some random alliance guy apparently did and I found the video by chance on Reddit a few years ago. I was watching it and noticed a familiar name then I saw a Shadow Priest named Poltergeist in the raid and almost pooped my pants when I saw it was one of my raids. Its so cool to get to see those videos, it's like video game archaeology. 
---
Leveling up solo as a warrior in Vanilla (leveling up as most classes) wasn't hard, but it just took some being strategic with your pulls and stuff. Take one more than two mobs that are your level or higher and you definitely needed to eat/drink.
---
In my opinion, for all of the nostalgia surrounding Vanilla, the class and spec balance as well as the self-sufficiency they added for most/all classes in BC made the game much more fun.
---
This is the thing. If you arent specced resto at 60 and try to heal is going to be gruesome. Can it be done? Yes. This draws the question if it can be done do we do it? No. I would not take a feral druid as my healer that late in the game. It means he cant party heal and will single targetheal. He doesnt have the proper spells and he doesnt have the mana just period. If your tank is a stancedancing warrior and your dps is absolutely on point then you could do it. Again it can be done but its going to mean everyone is making zero mistakes and also everyone is pretty geared. If your healer is the weaklink of the party then it means lots of wipes and very slow dungeon crawling. This is not what i see people wanting. Thw gear doesnt work the same in retail so in vanilla you run as quick as possiblr and if the item ypu want doesnt drop you reset the instances and start your farm running. A slow or improperly specced healer only throws wrenchs in thia system.
---
Source me. I main druids. 
---
People combine it, but they do it in organized way that allows for RPers to fight RPers instead of people who don´t RP.
---
Plus, this danger you speak of often contradicts lore itself. Stranglethorn isn´t warzone between Alliance and Horde where undead rogue is going to kill you once you step there. It´s a jungle filled with Gurubashi trolls and so on.
---
On top of that, you are mixing the game and RP. Danger is out there, it just isn´t represented through in-game death. And just like I said before, three orcs attacking humans fighting another human while completely ignoring horde of demons between them doesn´t make sense and most RPers would simply ignore it in IC (in character) terms.
---
So the only "danger" ends up being danger of having your event disrupted and maybe even ended prematurely and as someone who does events for his guild, having something I prepared for hours destroyed because three dudes went to grief RPers doesn´t feel like fulfilling way to do RP.
---
Aren’t hordies supposed to use axes?  Just sayin’
---
My fear is that they will add it in 6 months from launch and everyone will be forced to pay for the server change or start brand new characters. At that point I don't think I would bother.
---
I had picture in mind for months ! Greatly executed :)
---
In PvP druid is much less gear dependent. Ele shaman needs to be able to nuke down targets fast and facetank damage, especially in PUG PvP where you don't have much support, a playstyle that benefits a lot from having great gear.
---
I like you, i don’t know what it is, but you got it
---
The thing is, people ask this every day for over a year now. We know we get the 1.12 patch and thats that. Its actually the most balanced vanila patch.
---
Addin more changes is not something we want and not something they should do. We want an autentic vanilla recreation. 
---
Well to begin with, simply by their name, RpPvP servers will attract a different crowd of people.
---
PvP is the go to type of realm, which will attract most of the elitists, fast levelers, raiding pros etc. etc.
---
From my experience , the RpPvP community is more lax when it comes to the game. It's more about taking your time, enjoying the social aspects of the game, the leveling phase, server wide Rp events etc.. It's just a different experience since the majority of the player base has a different philosophy with which they approach the game.
---
So it's about a different playstyle mostly. Having an RpPvP server at launch will bring those people together without having to pair them up with the regular PvP crowd (no offense in anyway to the PvP people. It's about different playstyles and every server type offers a different one). 
---
Ah, I usually solo level haha. stack stam.
---
At the time it did, I do not know if it still does or not. Got yelled at several times for accidentally shielding the MT
---
Having never played on a RP server, what exactly is it like? What’s the allure? How is it different?
---
I just decided on that exact switch myself. You can heal dungeons as elemental and do great burst damage in PvP. Druid resto/balance doesn't do quite as well, though you can still do a balance spec and heal in dungeons fine. Balance isn't as strong as elemental, though. So unless you want to pay to respec all the time, the shaman sounds like it'll be your best bet.
---
Hahaha we were even using some of them last year 
---
Account for alts? You can only be logged in to one character at a time? Did you think the cap was total characters on the server? 
---
The cap is number of accounts being able to be logged in at the same time. The 2500 cap was a core design decision, they're not going to change that.
---
There are a lot of great thoughts on druids here, but something is missing. An extensive breakdown of Druid PvP.   
---
How do druids perform in 1v1s? Which classes do they beat, what do they lose to.  
---
How do they perform in world PvP? 1vX?    
---
In WSG they FC amazingly - but how do they do in other BGs (Arathi, AV)?   
---
We need a PvP druid expert in here PRONTO !!!
---
WAY too late.  
---
 \- wait for someone to turn in (from another or your guild) his Onyxia head. 
---
Dropping Ony Heads will have a cooldown. So if another guild dropped theirs an hour ago, you will have to wait some time before you are able to receive another Ony buff in the same city.
---
 \- Parking herbalism alts on rare, extremly expensive black lotus spawn locations.
---
Retail spawn locations/time intervals will not be as predictable as what we have experienced on pservers.
---
Some things might be easier, though - like Hunters being able to solo DMT (which was eventually nerfed on Nost.)
---
&gt; I’ve played most of the raids at 60 on private servers and I still think dungeons are fun. 
---
Deadmines isn't that great though, at least not good enough to be the favourite dungeon of a huge chunk of players if they have actually played much more than that. 
---
&gt;I’d also argue, people who played back then know how bad those specs could be at times, so they have the forethought to not do that.
---
Yeah, that's what I mean, if you were 6-10 years old you would not know that. You might have played the game a little bit, and thought being a paladin and hitting stuff with a hammer was super fun or whatever, but not enough that you really experience the spec. 
---
&gt;Id also argue that younger people are more of the min/max crowd, compared to the older folks who just want to enjoy it their way. 
---
I think that is true, but it's more about private server people, who are also (like this subreddit) filled with relatively young people in vanilla WoW terms. 
---
&gt;TLDR; can’t wait to do sfk, best dungeon ever!
---
It's fine liking whatever dungeon you want (except Gnomeregan). I was mostly thinking about how much of the nostalgic discussion on here is pretty much confined to levelling in barrens/westfall and doing Deadmines. Or that sort of thing. 
---
If you don't like the class fantasy, then I'd suggest going for something else. You'll spend a lot of time with the character being a jack of all trades and if you aren't fully sold, then you probably won't feel satisfied.
---
If you can get ahead of the snowball it'll make questing much faster. Not having to wait for spawns is very nice.
---
Lol trinket, warstomp, faerie fire, abolish poison, nature’s grasp, travel form, peaceee
---
sstvNPC
---
The hunter single target pull! Shoot a mob and start running away from its pull location and then send your pet after it. This puts you in combat with all the mobs that pulled and your pet is in combat with only the target. Then feign death. This causes the mobs that weren't in combat with your pet to reset, leaving just you, your pet and the target in combat. 
---
yeah lol ive been thinking about mage for a change but i love lock a lot
---
This isn't necessarily a Class trick but I felt this might be a good place to share.
---
The Illusionary Rod that drops in SM Library is the Highest DPS item for Enhancement Shaman and Feral druids in the game for the required level. Don't let Cloth wearers tell you otherwise.
---
You dont see the irony in claiming to not care about minmaxing while calling people that do care for toxic? If someone does not want to minmax then it makes absolutely no difference that somebody else does.
---
Yet people are going out of their way to tell everyone how much the players that do minmax suck and try to make it out like we are terrible people.
---
Look at the post above from Techtech1234:  "assholes pservers elitists "
---
I minmax because I like doing it. I expect the people I do play with to also minmax. But dont try to make us the bad guys for playing the game optimally because it does not affect you the slightest. Get off your high horse already and just play the game how you like.
---
If you guys were actually happy playing the game more casually you would not care about people that play the game with a more hardcore attitude. There's absolutely some jelousy involved here or you would just keep to yourself being happy about that.

i got inspected before raids in 2005-2006, nice try blaming PS. I also was told as a mage to buy fire resistance, i wasted most of my gold on that before learning the truth and vendoring the gear for a small fraction of the cost after stepping into the raid and inspecting people.
---
We also had a new hunter leave the guild after a feral druid won a ring he wanted, "it hurts the guild since he is resto for this run and can't use it"
---
Vanilla had toxicity in it, it was vidya.
---
‘To account for’ does not mean the same as having a separate WoW account 
---
A different player philosophy. Players tend to make up back stories for their characters and act out scripted stories and/or do regular roleplaying in character (meaning they talk and act like their character actually would). It's fun when you get into it and adds a whole new layer to WoW.
---
inb4 you downvote for disagreeing with me, hear me out. Is having RP servers really a high priority that the community should push? I feel like there are some great things we could be teaming up to ask for. In reality, isn't the only difference between an RP-PVP server and a PVP server the title? Instead of using up the small developer team's limited bandwidth with a non-issue, why doesn't the supposedly tightly-knit RP community come together and decide on a single server to be their RP server? Think about it this way: if you have a listed RP server, you are inevitably going to have a portion of the population flocking to that server simply to be a troll to the RPers. So why don't you just have an underground movement to all land on the same server, enjoy your RP time, and never let it cross the radar of the dicks who want to ruin it?
---
You *should* lose control of your pet until the taunt falls off, probably varies by server right now, but intended functionality you should lose control.
---
Is it generally a smaller population? 
---
I'm sure they'll rush out the game now
---
This will not happen most likely. The best we can hope for is seasonal servers that reset a year after naxx is open. 
---
Honestly, I doubt it. They didn't even keep change logs of the game code, hence the Frankenstein 1.13 patch we're getting. I doubt balance tracking to that degree was something they were even thinking about at the time.
---
Hey and that's all I was asking about my dude, so thanks for the info! It's been a while since I read on it, and the last bit I saw was along the lines of, "it will be 1.12 but we don't know if we'll add anything else in" so I thought I'd check Reddit since y'all know shit better than most of the internet.
---
Was part of a guild that wasn't full of min/maxers back in the day. We weren't the best on the server but was good, did everything up to 1 boss in naxx before BC. Anyways, we never did anything 100% blindly... granted we knew when we would wipe as "trial runs" to learn the boss because reading/watching about one can only do so much. Long story short no one went into bosses with 0% knowledge but I am sure you will find guilds of people who never played Vanilla. 
---
Being dps means you need powershifting and I dont really see that being difficult if you use macros.  If you are dpsing as straight feral youre not going to top any charts. 
---
If they are team red in classic they were never your friends to begin with.
---
jokes aside
---
don't be surprised if you end up despising a faction so much that you end up quitting or rolling on another server. It usually doesn't work out well when people are forced into a faction they dislike.
---
Best post I’ve seen in a while, but I’m starting to respect the min/max mentality.  I’ll see what my time is like when I start playing if I can flask and pot for raid or not.  I remember in vanilla when we raided if someone was topping the meters we used to say “yeah but they’re using a flask...” it was kinda funny back then.  Guild with he people you want to play with, if they require flasks and full consumes and you want to play like that, do it!  If not, I’m sure you’ll have about the same amount of fun.  Some people I played with barely raided or PVP’d at all and only concentrated on how much gold they could earn.  I remember a guy named Padrote saying he hit gold cap!  It’s all about how you wanna play.
---
Yea it was set in stone a long time ago. People are really done arguing about it.
---
But now you know! Have a nice weekend.
---
My guild is a semi hardcore with a core that works jobs early morning so we usually raid like 5pm-9pm CST
---
Can I use proc weapons and play melee mage? QQ private server elitists!!
---
Oh I'm right there with you, my ideal Wow Classic would be the Vanilla world with a rational itemization for every spec, TBC talents and no cross realm whatever, but I'll take #NOCHANGES any day instead of the solo game that retail has become.
---
You could replace every players by bots, nobody would notice. Back in Vanilla even Chinese farmers sorta belong to the community \^\^
---
My third warrior (yes, I leveled 3 warriors to 60 in Vanilla) was an undead, cannibalize is OP if you want to spare your meager resources, you eat what you kill :D
---
World buffs are usually disabled for a while (a month or so) when a new raid is released on a private server 
---
My perception of it (as a strictly horde player) is that horde like to talk a lot of shit just to trigger alliance players, and it works. We understand it's juvenile, it's just kind of funny too. There is a minor subsection of horde players that take it way too seriously though.
---
According to your profile I see you're a man of culture 
---
It’s not hard to get Dalrend wtf are you on about. You made a stupid point about a “lvl 40 blue”, weapon of all things, being “bis”. You need to kill a lvl  51 boss to get it. Stop throwing bis around when its clearly not, and just casually undershooting it by 10 lvls just to falsely reinforce your point.
---
Guess that make us both NPCs as alot people hate retail and want suck classic's old along :P
---
No part of it was a technical limitation. People need to stop spreading this LIE!
---
The server cap was somewhere between 2k and 3k and it was entirely a design decision. Mark Kern confirmed this on classicast 13 at the 39 minute mark. Kevin Jordan has confirmed this multiple times on stream.
---
A technical limitation around 4k players existed but that was completely irrelevant due to the designed cap being much lower.
---
I'll be very curious to see how things shake out in Classic. When it comes to looking for other players who are in it for the long haul to KT, you wonder how many of them will take the safe bet of joining the "all world buffs, everyone specced engineering" type guilds. And how many will be left to form less tryhard guilds that can go the distance? 
---
I have no plans for joining a guild before release but with my goals for Classic, I won't be surprised if I have to fall in the former camp. 
---
Well, it is also not roleplay friendly, let's say when I play a Night elf druid and see an Orc hunter killing animals in Ashenvale or I play a Paladin who has sworn to vanquish the undead from the face of the world, so I attack not just the Scourge but also the Forsaken. There would be plenty of Rp reason for that Night elf to attack that Orc and for that Paladin to attack the forsaken but this won't be possible on a regular Rp server. You're right with what you're saying but we can just turn this argument on it's head. There are rp reason to attack players of the opposing factions and rp reasons not to. The important part is to have the option, which is only given on rp servers.
---
And again, Rp is not just about scripted events. When some Horde Rpers go to Ashenvale to rp for example, they should have to be aware of the Alliance in that zone. I see this as part of immersive role playing.
---
Same - it needs to be on launch or it is pointless for me.
---
was on a private server
---
You are very right. We should follow the example of our Right Honourable players from the Alliance, who *never* engage in disparaging banter about the Horde.
---
Damn, that is a true nerd kingdom is the best sense possible 😀👍🏻
---
True, let's change everything!
---
rotten apple
---
Alliance are a bunch if racists, apparently
---
It still begs the question what do you want outof this game? 
---
You cannot role a druid and expect to have server firsts. Druids have a heavy gear bias. Without the proper gear you are going to be shite. It is completely possible to do most things other classes do as a druid and do them well too! But to do some of these things it means other members ofthe parties have already surpassed the bar. Meaning you have to be with thosethat are geared for a druid to do what it wants. You cant go into mc tanking when noone else in the raid has gear. You will be the weaklink and a tank that is weak equals wipes. 
---
A healing druid has it alot easier imo. The gear is easier to acquire and its not as hard to heal as it is to tank (sometimes and depending on the party members skills individually.)
---
And Kevin Jordan. On stream. Multiple times.
---
Seems appropriate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAdsq-RMg4c  
---
Also my phone's notification tone for a while.
---
Pinnacle for druids. He has consumables spreadsheets too
---
On average your min max guild will be more stable then your casual or semi casual guild for several reasons:
---
1) recruitment: people know what to expect from the guild and it is clear what guild expects from recruits. Usually not so clear cut with other guilds.
---
2) same oriented views over different stuff like buffs optimization
---
3) less loot drama: kinda ties to point above
---
4) min maxing means better runs which eliminates a big reason people quit guilds
---
5) easier recruitment: in every guild there is someone who min maxes and would probably join the min max guild at some point
---
6) Min max means people play a lot more, so they also bond more
---
Some negatives exist too of course, but those are reasons those type of guilds are on average more stable.
---
I really don't think the team have such a small "bandwidth" as you may think. Spell batching, something not many people pushed for (compared to other concerns) as it was a bit obscure, was implemented. An RP-PVP server at launch is almost no effort in comparison.
---
I don't really think an "underground" RP movement will go anywhere, as if it's well-known then it's not underground and so griefers will show up anyway, and if not then many players interested in RP will never even become aware that a server or two is an "underground" RP server. To say nothing of how much effort it would take for players to organize such a thing, compared to the amount of effort it would take for blizzard to provide official and supported servers.
---
dartols rod of transformation! I'm going horde this time though... does horde side have anything similar?
---
I think its good, and fully support, fighting against the min-max mentality. I don't think it will ruin classic wow though. From my experience on the private servers it felt like there were plenty of people in the actual game that don't care about min maxing. It's just in the online forum boards that it has a huge impact. 
---
Druids only...
---
I leveled a Warrior and a Rogue to 60 in Vanilla, and I often wonder what it would have been like to go back 1-60 with a better understanding of the game. My Warrior was, well, not good. Who knows, maybe Classic will be that chance.
---
I never tried out Fury until BC. I wonder if I could level up as that (well, post level 30 for that Zerker stance I guess) successfully...
---
The cannonball runner Trinket from strat live. It spawned a cannon turret that automatically shot cannon balls at anyone in front of it. Did pretty ok damage especially for a level 47 trinket but I just think it's funny to have a pirate cannon shooting people
---
Of course, it's very likely we will see a release of all past expansions. Blizzard kind of backed themselves into a corner by doing Classic Vanilla. All the reasons they gave for doing it can apply to fans of any expansion, not just vanilla. They would be giving favor to Vanilla fans over say TBC fans if they only did Classic Vanilla. All of their reasoning and logic given as to why they did classic makes the same amount of sense for any expansion or experience not currently offered in retail.
---
Certainly not always, but I'm just drawing a general correlation. The person that doesn't care about potting, also often tends to be the person that doesn't sim his/her character to figure out what secondary stats to gem or is the person that hsan't perfected his/her rotation.
---
Oppositely, the person that is burning throug pots, because of the expense, will go the extra mile in other areas as to not waste the benefit.
---
Nice MAGA hat (Make Azeroth Great Again), where did you get that??
---
"heh I told him to prove something that is common knowledge , he couldn't even withstand me using 3% of my power"
---
Prove they are good despite their clear lack of relevant mechanics? You know pvp is based on strategy and enhance brings very little, they literally get stormstrike and a few stat talents, a shaman in a dif spec has 90% of their abilities.
---
&gt; Comparing 1handers to 2handers and only looking at raw stats rather than procs
---
Nice. 
---
Im sure next announcement will be that they are addin a RP PvP realm. We all know blizz loves to talk about RP related issues.
---
I hope you guys get it. But once you got it I dont want anymore diccussions about it. I'm done talking about Rp stuff. 
---
1. I don't downvote when I disagree. That's not what it is for (though most redditors seem to have forgotten this).
---
2. It is a high priority for me and my friends. Some won't play if it isn't there on launch.
---
3. RP-PVP has different rules from PVP servers (mostly for preventing trolling)
---
4. The WoW Classic RP community is not tightly-knit. Mainly because it is non-existent. Most RP-PVPers won't find that "community designated RP" PVP server because they won't know about it or where to look. Hence the need for an official one.
---
5. It literally takes no additional developer time... it is just adding RP to the front of one of the pvp servers.
---
6. Thus this is not a "non-issue" as you put it.
---
But I appreciate your positivity. 
---
Haha, what? No. A friend of mine played mage to rank 14, rerolled horde and played a shaman to rank 14. He was insane, really really good player. I think we were quite 50/50 and he had full PvP gear and I was in blues.
---
Mage isn't that hard as rogue, but a good geared mage is hard.
---
I couldn't do that. I've tried playing Alliance a couple times but it just feels wrong in so many ways.
---
How could I possibly:
---
- Ally with gnomes
---
- Not be beautifully green
---
- Attack my fellow orc master race
---
I could never be a traitor. I'd rather corpse camp my friends than abandon my faction and race.
---
I don't think its possible to fail actually.
---
Good fucking luck getting both dalrends before the first raid, especially when half the group will be melee. 
---
You are severely underestimating the power extra attacks for rogues if you think that thrash blade is not a pre raid BiS.
---
It's a quest item without a level requirement. You can pick up the quest in your mid 40s, whether or not you can find a group to carry you though mara at that level is a different issue.
---
And once again, the actual difference in dps between these weapons is minimal!
---
You have angered the wrong gnome today!
---
Normally I would already be casting my Impending Doom upon you, but we need to stay united if we are to get our RP-PvP servers!
---
Hard to say.
---
They have a lower population on retail and also had a lower population during Vanilla/BC/Wrath. But this is not necessarily applicable to Classic since Vanilla only saw RpPvP servers halfway through it's lifetime, heavily disadvantaging those type of servers.
---
My theory is that a few RpPvP servers in Classic would have a high and stable population IF they are released at launch. If they are released post launch they will likely suffer the same fate as RpPvP servers in Vanilla: Being low pop PvP servers with a fancy name. So Blizzard is going in the completely wrong direction by not having them at release.
---
That's the point. Thrash blade is still considered a great weapon at max level. Did you miss that?
---
All I remember is 10~12 Guys afking at times during fights/mob clearing.
---
*"I don't plan on raiding"*
---
*"Raid gear is OP"*
---
Lmfao, this killed me. 
---
"Semi-hardcore" aka "regular" raiding.  
---
LOL if you think LP is a good indicator. LegacyPlayers only checks/updates when it’s actively saving data (aka during raids), you really don’t have a clue do you?
---
Mithril spurs, carrot on a stick and +riding enchant for gloves. 
---
&gt; I hope you guys get it.
---
&gt; I'm done talking about Rp stuff.
---
That's cool. No one is forcing you to.
---
For sure there will be no balance  changes.  The whole reason a lot of us are playing Classic is because we want to go back to the bandage/eat between each mob model.
---
What does that do exactly?
---
What does that do?
---
It’s a new game. Everyone will have nothing. 
---
To reiterate, the pop numbers above are placeholders.  Forget about the actual numbers.  The point of the post is to try and understand why its so hard to:
---
**1) fill existing servers first before opening new ones**
---
**2) get the horde/alliance balance right**
---
Actually, playing allies, the bad omen was gutterspeak because it meant undead rogue 99% of the time.
---
If its common knowledge why is it so hard to prove?
---
Orb of Deception was one of my favorite trinkets. Loved being able to look like an Orc as a human.
---
Sorry buddy go cry to someone else.
---
Druid wpvp great but falls off as gear progresses into the AQ40 / Naxx era. Druids are naturally strong against both Rogues and Mages and have a direct weakness to Hunters, Warlocks and Shamans. Warriors can be difficult depending on their gear and skill. Player skill will come out ahead as well as environmental restrictions (indoors vs outdoors, LOS abuse etc). 
---
Druids are great anchors for AB and of course as you mentioned are the best FC's in the game and will prosper in WSG for ranking. In AV theyre great for stealthing to leader or towers and can help hold these locations. 
---
All specs for druid can be used in pvp, although if I had to pick 2 it would be : Feral Charge+Swiftmend / Feral Charge + Balance + Insect Swarm.
---
Here's a pre raid BiS list, it's even ranked higher than krol blade.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j81TgG0p_HrYKajiUiQfYIoSUx1culzy2u_Fc4wtiS8/htmlview#
---
And don't tell me that you can easily get ironfoe as a rogue...
---
My point was that these crybabies are blowing minmaxers opinions out of proportions, and nitpicking a few assholes spouting these (objectively wrong) opinions like facts. In fact, most minmaxers/private server players will not tell you it's impossible to clear content unless you minma.
---
No, literally nobody is saying that. The only thing people are saying is that if you play in a subpar way, just be prepared that not all guilds will accept you.
---
Which is totally fine, there'll be guilds for everyone.
---
Warrior is the class I love but there's 90% chance I will play something else on classic :
---
\- do you remember tanking for PUGs ? I watched a BRD YouTube video yesterday, my PTSD resurfaced after all those years :D  
---
I love tanking but only with players that know to let you build agro in the beginning of the encounter. Most don't know or don't care, then you run around trying to save everybody (and then being called a noob if you wipe).
---
\- until you're geared and or healed you're everybody's bitch in PVP. And since my friend insist on rolling on a PVP server I want to play a class that has a chance even when geared in green / blue gear
---
So I'd take an even harsher levelling any day if these 2 issues were solved.
---
LoL this sub never fails to amuse.
---
Even the dumbest retail player wouldn’t be comparing a 1hander to 2handers. That’s a bad argument, especially since you’re replying to OP and I think you meant to reply to that comment chain about Trash Blade. 
---
It's just a visual thing, it turns you into a furbolg for 2(?) minutes.
---
You know some people are cool with paladin tanks being decent right? We don't ALL want it to be exactly identical.
---
Honestly, theres nothing gained from keeping certain bad specs bad (there aren't many). Shit, even the game designers (Kevin Jordan, for instance) have admitted that paladins were bad.
---
You think too highly of yourself.
---
Hit that platonic Romeo/Juliet thing. Friends from different sides, fighting each other for their king/warchief and nation, but in their spare times, they go down the neutral pubs and sink a few pints, swapping stories.
---
Not quite as good as leveling together, but makes for a hella (if a bit cliché) backstory. 
---
I thought that was in MoP only? 
---
Lol I only disagree because I WAS a paladin and shamans seemed so much better (in pvp). Warriors were just...... so good at many things so you might've rolled over many classes, haha.
---
Ive done all 60 dungeons just fine. Ive mt and ot in ubrs. Drakk is easy since paladins put out so much threat, taunt isnt needed. Ive done all DM wings, strat ud/live, scholo, brd, lbrs. I actually chain pull brd and only stop for the group to drink while i sit mostly at full mana. Ive even tanked some raids and had no problems. Anything else you want? The only tanking item I got when not tanking was helm of dominion in AQ because they needed healers, not tanks at that point
---
Still amazes me we were able to get 40 ppl on at the same time, let alone have a good group comp.
---
Trying to decide which of Druid or Warlock would be more fun as a first class for a solo PvE player, for everything else that is NOT raiding in the game. I'm most interested in entirely subjective opinions about which will be most fun while leveling and at 60 for someone doing solo PvE and occasional PUG dungeon runs, crafting, maybe light RP, and anything else that is relatively easy and casual.
---
I'm drawn to Druid by things like the travel forms, the utility of shape shifting for breaking CC, and being able to both "tank" and stealth from one spec seems pretty OP for solo open world stuff. It also seems overall to be a simpler class with less farming needed just to do your thing, like having to get soul shards and farm books to train your pets as the Warlock does. That's not a deal breaker for me though.
---
Warlock also seems like a solo leveling powerhouse as well though, with slightly lower cost mounts which are special for the class (although the Dreadsteed seems like it's a pretty epic quest to obtain and still very expensive). And I guess it has slightly more group appeal with dungeon summons. I think the deciding factor for most though will be that it has the potential to be in demand for raids without being forced into healing; but that's a non-factor since I'm not raiding anyway.
---
Do you see that orc killing animals in Ashenvale while IC or OOC? Does your druid live in Ashenvale or were you just questing there?
---
Because, as I said before, RP takes place outside of the game. When you are out in the world, RPing with your guild, people questing are usually ignored, because questing happens on OOC level, while all of you are IC.
---
You still make the mistake many players do when talking about RP: You act as if playing the game was part of it. It´s not.
---
Orb of deception! It did let you look like a race of the opposing faction, but it was fixed in what you would transform though. I was human and always got transformed into a troll. But gave me some fun nonetheless. It let you sometimes walk past your enemies in bg's (-:
---
The number of people that actually killed KT in vanilla is so small...
---
[Haunted Memento] probably the rarest item I got hold of atleast considering 2 of my mains still have them.
---
Get out!
---
Digging the map poster. Where did you get that?
---
When i first started playing WoW back in 07, i printed out a map to reference when i was playing. I marked all the flight points i knew of and such and used to figure out pathing.
---
Really want something like this.
---
The best solution is the same caps as launch and just make names connected cross realms. So if someone is named Bob on pvp server a, you can't create that name on pvp server b. Makes merging infinitely easier down the road. 
---
If they shard, why not shard this way is all I’m saying lol
---
Huh, "Doesn't have proper spells"? What spells outside of swiftmend does a resto druid gain? Also HOTW means he'll have more mana than a full resto druid. I honestly first thought you mistook the sub.
---
Are we still talking about Classic?
---
In any case, I fail to see what farming for hours has to do with "install an addon that tells you which colour gem to add" or "perfecting your rotation".
---
I'm talking about [this poll.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics) If you think that somehow reddit repells people who plays on RP servers, then you're delusional. Even if this subreddit was RPer-repellant, it still wouldn't make such a massive skewing toward RPPVP. I say all this as a person that has spent most of his WoW-time on Argent Dawn (RP).
---
&gt; There is reason why in Europe and NA, the only surviving RP servers (a.k.a. those that still have huge RP community) are PvE (or were, prior to addition of Warmode).
---
Gee, could it be because wPvP died?
---
&gt; Give me poll that is advertised on RP forums and media instead of Classic subreddit.
---
Yeah because that's sure to get a more balanced vote... I haven't seen it, don't think it exists. But hey tell you what: Why don't you find your own evidence of the claims you make, like i just did.
---
Nope. I had it back in Vanilla.
---
Eh, the way they debate/argue/screech in conversations makes me wonder (for many of them) if its even about nostalgia. A lot of people seem committed to an idea and do such a poor job of articulating and get so overly defensive that I question the people behind the screen.
---
WoW itself is so cartoony and graphically unimpressive. The cosmetic improvements over the years are welcome IMO. Its the gameplay that we all seem to enjoy.
---
Nah I have one sitting in my bags atm
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19870](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19870) 
---
Been in since Vanilla. Loa themselves have been in Warcraft lore since the beginning. They are Troll gods and Trolls are the oldest native, natural race on Azeroth. Not sure specifically how long the term "Loa" has existed though.
---
They were mentioned, by the name Loa, in that item and in the Warcraft RPG book Magic and Mayhem from 2004. IDK if this is the earliest or not.
---
Welcome to the rest of us workers who dont even get vacation days.
---
Good points!
---
GET!
---
Lol you just chain Rend runs with your guild, you can do 3 per hour almost. Give me a break.
---
Lol wat. Are you seriously calling head turning a factor of gameplay?
---
Me. Even tho I will most likely watch it a few times prior to the day of release.
---
If you're looking for 'solo pve player' I'm not sure classic is really what you're looking for. This entire version of the game is derived on player interaction. Unless you're referring to just solo grinding mobs for gold and profit, then I would recommend mage or hunter. 
---
Hunter has so many tricks and little things to know it is ridiculous. Lowest skill floor and face roll to play at the basic level but arguably one of the highest skill caps.
---
Anyone that claims that Vanilla didn't have issues like that obviously never played during that time.
---
Our guild had 7 warriors and rogues quit because of a leather helmet (?) going to a  feral cat who managed to do quite well.
---
People who recently joined guilds, had no DKP and yet expected loot "because it's better for their class" like in your example.
---
or the best and worst at the same time: Going to a guild, getting them to gear you up because you are the "Best dps" and then leaving to join a better guild.
---
Vanilla was full of toxic people, it's just that no one wants to admit it.
---
Interesting though, but it seems like trying to reinvent something that's only going to be necessary for like the first few hours of a 200 hour journey anyway.
---
Go look at the classic discord. Semi hardcore is the new normal it seems. 
---
I was on Stormreaver as well Clavvson, Night Elf priest, and Algrensan NE resto druid! Hit me up if you guys are looking for an alliance vanilla guild - We'll be a serious progression guild full of competitive Heroic(mythic) raiders that i've played with over the years.
---
So you want the possibly to level with sharding, but you want the lag and chaos that is seeing thousand players on your screen? Keep in mind this lag will be both on servers and on your pc.
---
I was shocked at the amount of enh sham and dps warriors using staffs but if it has the dps it has the dps which says a lot about how bad vanilla itemization was especially while leveling. 
---
troll mages redpill and bluepill, with accompanying colored mohawks and one fire one frost. Also did Hiphopopotamus (removed most vowels) and Rhymenocerous (again vowels) did Tauren shaman which seemed fitting. 
---
Not me but 2 warlocks, mattdemon and benafflock, could do specs there too I suppose. 
---
Any music duo or group. Saw tons of those twinking
---
I remember staring at the cover on the ride home when my parents bought it for me. Reading everything i could, opening it to read the little book that came with it detailing the classes and such.
---
Right? Woo you get vacation time but waah i cant play my vidja game.
---
Go do something else. You still have a vacation... Everything doesnt have to be about wow.
---
I don't think you understand rp that well.
---
Yes there are ooc and ic instances but the general idea of a roleplay game is to identify with your character and play a role. When I play a character I tend to act more like that character would, like attacking players of the opposing faction if my character would have reasons for that or doing primarily quests my character would be intersted in doing. That is rp.  You have more of the RpPvE perspective on Rp whereas I have more of the RpPvP perspective.
---
For me Rp is not just about rping in a tavern with other rpers but combining rp with the actual game. This is not possible on a RpPvE server since my character(s) would not abe able to act as they would.
---
Let's come back to the idea of the Paladin i n my previous post. I would play this character in a way that I would attack and kill (if capable) forsaken players since it is part of my characters personality.
---
So yes, rp can take place inside the game. You can divorce the two, but you don't have to and being forced to do so by PvE restrictions directly restricts part of the idea of Rp.
---
They're waiting to see when the one week I'm busy in July is.
---
This was pvp 101 when my cousin was teaching me the game.
---

Exactly. Those people are the kind of frothing ragers that can’t stand that you don’t know the tactics they’ve memorized through running the conetent again and again. I even have regular run-ins with those kinds of people on retail, mostly when I pug into guild runs. It’s usually just one or two people, don’t understand how their guilds can stand them.
---
No chance you're going to find 40+ people with that level of honesty. People will cheat. You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube on this expereince. To be honest, you can't even do this with retail on new content.
---
Yeah you'd need IRL friends or something, but even if you were mostly blind and got people to commit to the idea it might be fun to pursue. I think it'd be a great experience for leveling, though. Raiding is just..... a much greater test of the commitment to that idea.
---
Lmao 
---
This is too funny 
---
Take my upvote 
---
Yeah, totally. In vanilla a player's character could look like they were afk, but they might actually be furiously looking around at different things in order to strategize.
---
If everything you looked at was told to the opposite faction, that would potentially disclose your strategy to them.
---
I mean, I guess left click dragging and right click allow you to choose when to disclose this information, but seriously, it would actually change the game nontrivially and doesn't belong at all in Classic.
---
There you have it folks.  
---
yep. i'm horde but my OG vanilla friends are alliance (where we all started) and are thinking of playing classic as alliance. i'll join them for the nostalgia factor but they know an orc plays among them. 
---
i dont know any good mage that will be touched by a melee. if they do get touched, immediately block until u can stop them from touching you again. 
---
im not that proficient in classic pvp, but im a 3x glad so i know a thing or too. played on private server for a few months as mage and the only time a melee could ever touch me is if i made a mistake. i dont think your friend was as good as you think, especially if he lost to a rogue 1v1. mage counters all melee, hard. 
---
Druids are hard countered by Priests and Shaman in 1v1. Offensive dispels essentially prevent you from healing. In the open world, Feral can get the jump on a Priest, trinket out of Psychic Scream, and burst them down before they can heal pretty consistently. Shaman have too much armor to burst down so you pretty much just stay away from them unless they're out of mana or something.
---
In AV: you tank NPCs and keep them off of the other healers, then offheal in between. Your PvP spec will generally have more tanking talents than a Warrior's PvP spec so you're a more effective tank than them here.
---
In AB: Druids are great at solo defending bases because they destroy Rogues 1v1. (Sap does not work on you when you are in form.) They're also great at partnering with Rogues to stealth cap bases. I think going on the offensive is more useful - let the Hunters defend bases solo.
---
Overall, Druids are utility bots and secondary healers in organized PvP. Your job is to cast Roots + Faerie Fire on Warriors and Rogues, Hibernate pets and other Druids, and then tank hits in Bear Form when the other team inevitably focuses on you. Any spec works for this, but 0/30/21 (Heart of the Wild + Nature's Swiftness) is my favorite. It has the most survivability of any possible build.
---
Also... noggenfogger cause you hate yourself
---
Go take a look at any RP-PvP server discussion on this subreddit and you will rarely see people saying how they are roleplayers and look forward to RP in Vanilla, specifically on RP-PvP server.
---
Most of them are in line with what I wrote. People give all the reasons why they want to play on RP-PvP servers and RPing is rarely among them.
---
And what you wrote in regard to why RP-PvP servers died is just wrong. They died because they started to become filled with non-roleplayers who kept griefing RPers, so they eventually migrated to normal RP servers. Those RP-PvP servers still exist today, but all the roleplayers have left them, while RP servers are still a thing.
---
ok well i'm done agruing after this last point to my its the horde alliance divide the person saying pallys suck is a horde shammy... so gg wp cy@
---
Which is why he said "if it happens".
---
Rip my world buffs in BRM. Fun as hell though :p
---
I agree that Druids are the best flag carriers, but that's only one BG and is somewhat spec reliant.
---
Shamans can go elemental spec for pvp and still be raid viable as healers without switching specs.
---
Por La Gorda!
---
Or just not implement sharding and let people spend some extra time fighting over mobs if they want to.
---
Imperatoris is latin for Grand Marshall. and thats the goal
---
Literally from this thread
---
&gt;Depends how you want to play, if you have really shitty build and don't give a shit about your gear then you're basically just dead weight to others.
---
You need both to cap the flag in wsg
---
Agreeeed
---
stack spirit! so u can quest fasturr

sorry our buildings are a little behind times we were your slaves for quite some time and werent able to attend human school 
---
oh wait im dumb lol
---
I am sick of people comparing pservers and making predictions what classic will be.
---
DO THIS, DO THAT, YOU NEED THIS, YOU NEED THAT... no, I and I am pretty sure most of the players don’t need anything, we are not here to minmaxing as every shit post like this is about. 
---
BUT IF YOU DONT MINMAX YOU WILL NEVER EVER BE IN A TOP GUILD AND CLEAR ALL OF THE CONTENT , this is this type of post.
---
Every pserver player who thinks he has unlocked the ultimate strategy to be the best is going to hit a brick will with the speed of light. Don’t get me started on how far off values are on pservers. The other thing is that this game requires you to interact with other people in order to progress. Good luck on finding 40 minmaxers, stop doing these shit posts and stop assuming that it will be the same as pservers. 
---
I know I am harsh but for fuck sake, stop comparing. 
---
SAME IP, DIFFERENT GAME
---
Like other have said, no. You’re basically starting from scratch 
---
Disagree. Let me fight over mobs. I want the authentic experience. Not seeing someone fight an invisible mob 
---
I think I'm dumber for reading this.
---
It hasn’t been decided yet, but I’ve already said I’ll play whatever side they want to play. My wife likes the Alliance aesthetic better and my buddy loves Paladins. I’ve been Horde for 14 years, but playing with friends and people I love is more important. 
---
Wait so you're concerned with...... people standing around, looking at each other's heads to see what direction they're looking at and reporting it back to the team so they can then use that information to decipher the strategy of the enemy team and have some kind of combat superiority?
---
In...... PvP? Flagged..... afk players who act as scouts wouldn't be able to do so because people are reading their head directions? 
---
Nah, way too far fetched. You're yankin my chain.
---
potato, potato. I am just trying to keep up with the cool kids lingo these days. basically im trying to do it on a regular basis, and would like consistency from people. but its a game and people have real lives, so they wont get reprimanded for having a life and missing raids.
---
seriously its like they continue the lore of alliance being slave owners and roleplay as racist elitists
---
Such a good idea.  Blizz has a HUGE opportunity to get it right this time!!!!
---
Ya i'd like to second these sentiments. but also reiterate that druids are a predictive healer less than a reactive healer. Overall their healing output will be lower in MOST situations than the other big 3, however they can prosper on specific fights and still offer quite a bit to a raid besides B Rez and buffs. 1-2 Druids is probably optimal for a 40 man composition. 
---
Thanks! Looks like this is the definite answer.
---
I think I'll leave the name in, but make a footnote that it's barely used and that Loa as a concept was very underdeveloped compared to today.
---
EsfandTVs merch store. They come in blue black and red!
---
I think you are mixing RPG and RP. Point of RP is to create a story for your character and interract with others, be it in walk-up roleplay in Stormwind, in taverns, in the field or even while fighting other faction. It´s not about identifying with your character or doing quests that make sense for that character (because if you claim that you did those quests ICly, RPers will end up ignoring you...you can´t really find Mankrik´s wife IC).
---
RP is about creating stories. What you described is going through the game´s story. It´s similar to doing Witcher run as good/evil Geralt, while RP is like creating completely new story set in Witcher universe.
---
seriously having to group with gnomes no thx
---
I think I played on Dark Iron when it launched.  That server was complete $#%&amp;\^%ed
---
Because telling someone they can't play with their friends is a quick way to lose their subscription. 
---
Sure, okay, let's make Paladin tanks "decent".
---
Oh, now Druids want to be "decent" too, and now Shamans want to be "decent" too, and....now we've made a bunch of class changes and oh look, it's retail capped at level 60 instead of 1.12.
---
Shoo. This is 1.12, not retail. If you want class changes and "balance", go play retail.
---
The private server community on this sub really is the worst. I wish most of them would just shut up.
---
I wish you luck in your goal, but it’s Latin for emperor.
---
I have similar objectives, maybe I’ll see you in the battlegrounds. 
---
Friends can fuck off, alliance all the way.
---
&gt; My fear is that I won't find a Guild before launch. And even worse would be that I pick my realm and I can't find a Guild. 
---
If you hit 60 reasonably quickly and max out raid useful tradeskills you'll have a good shot to find a guild, especially if they use the original level 60 dungeon group numbers. 10 man Scholo/Strat/LBRS and 15 man UBRS, you'll meet a lot more people and actually have to communicate. If you show that you are at least decent you'll get in a guild.
---
It's also going to lead to everyone being named xlcldbobxol instead of just bob, hard pass. Names get dumb enough already without making them cross realm unique.
---

---
Downranking truly was important in vaniller.
---
horde fanboys - or a primal fear. Maybe a combination of both ;)
---
I know you're joking but what's the issue with dwarf warriors? The 1 hour 20 min naxx speedrun had night elf fury warrior and as far as I know they don't provide any dps or utility for the role.
---
So many guilds struggle to get 20 people to consistently show up, I have no idea how anyone managed to get 40 people back in the day.
---
Yeah I’m with you, there needs to be some sort of tooltip or system in place to prevent a more than 5% deviation from 50/50. What it is, I don’t know and we certainly won’t see one as sad as it is. 
---
Shamans and Hunters can stalk anyone (or scout any worldboss) on the same continent by recasting eagle eye or farsight without ever leaving a city
---
Warriors can taunt a pet during a charge to force the pet to either break them out of a hunters trap or to interrupt/suppress a seduce (succubus or stealthed hunter pets  require challenging shout for this)
---
Vis-a-vis as hunter or warlock put your pet on hold and move to a different position when you know that a fight is about to happen. Your pet should never be a stepping stone for your target to reach you and be a flanker/support instead. People will look for your pet next to you and a succubus standing 20y behind someone forces an unpleasant decision.
---
You can suppress basic attacks or weave abilities in between swings to build up sunder armor on a crowd controlled target to ensure that it will go after you once the crowd control breaks
---
Same goes for hunters with distracting shots if you want to make sure you can re-trap the target without it munching on your support before that.
---
Hunter stings are exclusive, so they can overwrite a wyvern stings dot (that occurs after the sleep effect expires or is broken by dmg) with a scorpid sting - or overwrite a serpent/viper with scorpid if you need to crowd control the target for whatever reason
---
Hunters can swap equipment mid fight with feign death (ought to be obvious by now, so it's just here as I go through my mental notes)
---
Hunter pets (boars) can intercept a charging/intercepting warrior - effectively nullifying the charge
---
With spell batching hunter pets (boars) can desync warriors (and bear form druids) from the server if the boar's charge hits the warrior/bear right when the charge begins (not during or at the end). Rendering them helpless targets until they relogg
---
If your tank is overgeared for the content and you end up rage starved make a /sit macro. While we have confirmation that talents for being critted won't work anymore. You still get a 100% crit and that means rage.
---
You can go 'save zone' or 'low lvl' fishing with hunters by taming an animal from a low level questing area as your pet. Name it like the source. Chances are people will just attack it and flag themselves for pvp this way
---
If you go beyond the basic rendering range (150y) with eyes of the beast your pet loses the master tag and just appears as generic horde/alliance flagged animal
---
Warlock and Hunter pets despawn when they go beyond the basic rendering range, while annoying for warlocks as they lose a soulshard it is a useful tool for hunters to distract npcs or players with your pet - without sacrificing the pet as you can just summon it again with no downsides aside from some minor happiness loss. For PvE this allows your group or the solo farming hunter to skip groups as only the hunter and the pet will be in combat with a group. The pet will despawn and the hunter just feign death-s.-
---
Rogues can vanish out of any spell or projectile that is flying towards them and 'evade' it as long as the spell batching doesn't count the spell/projectile impact with the timing of the vanish purge effect
---
Hunter Flares do not prevent rogues from using vanish. But they suppress the vanish purge effect from removing in flight projectiles/spells
---
Hunters with track hidden are lvl 66 for stealth detect and can easily reach 72, 74 or 76 in coordinated BG groups. Allowing them to see Rogues in stealth over a distance of more than 100y (default lvl 66 without item or warlock parnoia support still ensures that hunters can see stealthed rogues and druids from 30y away - which makes them easy pickings)
---
With the bow Hurricane [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Hurricane\_(bow)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Hurricane_(bow)) you can create a silly situation with certain gear combinations and a 1 sec attack speed pet like broken tooth  (or a ZG bat) to delay a 1.5 sec cast up to a 11,4 second cast (excluding pushback talents, but factoring in pushback diminishing returns) if the servers ever progress into BC this changes to the max time up to 16.1 seconds.
---
What is the canon 0/30/21 build that people mean when they suggest that? Is there one? Cause I've looked around and I see it recommended a lot, but everyone who posts it seems to have a different idea about where those 30 and 21 points go.
---
And one day you horde scum will be slaves again. 
---
For The Alliance!
---
Maybe this is because pserver raiding will be much harder than classic raiding? Someone found KT armor value to be &lt;3k in retail vanilla, whicch is less than lucifron on pservers
---
leave it to google translate to fail me like that. oh well, im committed 
---
Cosmetic change to be a Furlborg. You just have to make sure not to complete the quest that it's used for and you can keep that bad boy forever.
---
&gt; Well they were proven wrong when someone from blizz said that  
---
&gt; private servers were doing resistances and boss armour all wrong 
---
&gt; and that it was way different in actual vanilla
---
Source?
---
Announcing that servers are going to be merged is a bad sign for any MMO. That's why Blizzard doesn't do traditional server merges, and never will. Sharding at the start of Classic will (hopefully) keep us from having to deal with Connected Realms down the line. Blame all the BfA tourists.
---
Don't think anyone is arguing it's not a great item, but literally by definition there can only be a single option that is "BIS" for any given raid tier (or pre-raid).

Just be patient for a few days while the other faction registers.  Or change factions.  
---
Plus you will have 2 or 3 servers to choose from.  There WILL be a server open (3/3 server in your time zone being horde capped?  I doubt it).
---
Grabbing subs for short term gain cost Blizz the game in the long run IMO (who cares about bots, we have our subs!  Yeah that worked out great.....)

I'm planning on a hunter start, this will be very useful! Thanks!

Wow, I'm glad I don't have any friends, fewer problems for me

Spell batching is still in retail. They're on high priority on retail and making it a low priority loop on Classic. It's wrote in the post.

-also no one ever.

Protip: brew a large pot of cold brew coffee. Keeps fresh for many days so you don't have to waste precious time brewing new pots each day.

I've been Alliance since TBC when I chose gnome mage. On retail during legion i joined a project 60 guild. Met a lot of great people are we all are good friends, however the majority loves Horde. The worst part is my dad and brother are Horde lads as well. So it looks like it is Tauren Druid for me.
---
&gt; I just prefer to level them with good gear as it multiplies what you can do with a class that can offer so much.
---
that's why I prefefr them to have good gear, especially the AQ one and later.
---
ahhh its second hand from my friend who watched some video someone did about an interview with an original vanilla dev, i'm not sure which one.  there is a vid by a popular youtuber talking about differences but im not sure he mentioned the resistance thing
---
Something like this: [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxRscrzxVxfoLo](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxRscrzxVxfoLo)
---
I made that quickly and the points are pretty flexible. Basically the must-haves are Nature's Swiftness, Furor, Heart of the Wild, Sharpened Claws, Blood Frenzy, Primal Fury, Reflection, and Feral Charge.  
---
A 30/21 spec can be changed depending on what you prefer to do, so take points out of Feline Swiftness and stick them in Thick Hide for tanking. I wouldn't since the cat movement boost while outside is amazing, but it is an option.
---
You could move the points from Tranquil Spirit to Nature's Focus if you'd like to. Take away Insect Swarm if you don't see yourself using it. Lots of room to work.  
---
Ones I wouldn't grab in a 30/21 spec:   
---
* Improved Shred (more for powershifting)
---
* Savage Fury (Not as good as it sounds)
---
* Subtlety (5 points are way better elsewhere)
---
* Improved Rejuve (not a good use of 3 points for this spec)
---
I remember raiding MC with a level 39 green staff because it was the only weapon I had +healing power with.
---
If this mentality is brought rip my nostalgia.
---
Of course you can try your best to pull your weight with not the best specs like retri , but I was talking about complete negligence of caring about wtf you're doing.
---
When usually people raid as retri or boom it's either they wanna challenge themselves or they genuinely like that spec, but if you want to actually raid with that spec, you just don't go with a random ass build and expect others to carry you around. It takes effort.
---
Not saying you can't play how you want, but don't expect everyone to carry you forever.
---
&gt; healing with 4 dps
---
right, healing spells have quite decent threat
---
Rp=Roleplay
---
Rpg=Roleplaying game.
---
So basically in a Roleplaying game you roleplay, simple as that. 
---
What you said about mankrik's wife etc. is a basic flaw of mmos since most people will have done the quest so you don't act as if your character did that quest but you can still do quests and play the game IC.
---
It's the same way I would play Elder scrolls, my character would and wouldn't do certain things based on his character. The same thing works in WoW.
---
Well it doesn't matter anyway, everyone should be able to play the game the way they want. That's why RpPvP servers should be available at launch.
---
What if the intake fan is rear facing though?
---
Until Naxx that's largely true.  The faster and more efficient the run though, the less overall consumables you have to use even if you're full consuming.  It only really gets expensive if the raids take a long time or you're wiping a lot.
---
&gt; Plus I like to level as balance, do you already tried to lvl as a balance drood without good gear? It's a real pain ^^
---
With that kind of gear, the biggest pain is that it's expensive, and is gone after a single use.
---
You know what kind of gear I'm talking about. The absolute minimum for balance druids, you know.
---
BTW I too like to level as a Balance.

&gt;Must've been really stupid

Sharded mobs but not players. Aka thousands of people around you lagging you while fighting invisible mobs you don't see.

Lol, saved mini raids with these and feign death. Loved em
---
I've never read that RPG book but might try to find a PDF. That RPG was offical Blizzard stuff and it seems the Loa are mentioned there a decent amount. Came out same year as WoW launch.
---
I feel like it's a thing for Blizz to entirely ignore the existence of pservers (outside of Nost), so I'd be surprised if they said something that specific.  I don't watch a lot of interviews/podcast kind of stuff though unless it's just Blizz so who knows.
---
Either way, it'd be nice if MC was actually harder than it is on pservers.
---
It's funny how most "battle stations" back then were small tables/work desks.
---
To the guy that deleted his comment about playing with friends:
---
Allow an "invite a friend" option in game?  
---
Im guessing most folks would join servers at the same time.  Small small minority that doesnt can perhaps use an invite a friend option to join the server their buddy is on?
---
You make a good point.  Just trying to come up with ideas for a solution.  I feel very strongly about high pops &amp; server balance.  Its a critical success factor IMO to making the game last in the YEARS to come, and keep folks engaged.  
---
I'd like to piggyback on this question if anyone has any similar knowledge regarding the Pewds chair. As a fellow boomer my disposable income is significantly higher than it was 10-15 years ago.
---
Don't put points into Prot while leveling.  You will be able to tank everything along the way absolutely fine in any spec, you'll just want to toss on a shield and +Stam plate armor.
---
Which is why I said guilds will usually see the people who are being negligent and will simply not schedule them on anymore. Play how you want, be negligent if you want, just like in life things will catch up to you. People will stop working with you if you don't seem to care. 
---
Try vanillafriends.com 
---
Well obviously no gems in Classic, but I’m talking about my entire experience with people dating back to Vanilla WoW.
---
And yes, some people use add ons, but others read class guides and fail to realize their stat weights change with gearing.
---
And rotation mistakes can be huge. So many people do things wrong because they fail to ever learn how to do them correctly.
---
My point is most good players tend to do all the little things while bad players tend to miss multiple things.
---
All right then I won't worry about it.
---
This amuses me
---
Nothing has been confirmed yet
---
^MY YOU’RE A TALL ONE!
---
That macro makes me happy
---
Just here to add my voice.  We need RPPVP.
---
Probably fine to tank as Arms. Give it a try and adjust to put points in prot if you have survivability issues. But as long as you have a decent group it should be fine. 
---
No
---
Gimme a blue post blizz REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
You never need points in prot, ever. 
---
I'm in the same boat as you OP. I figured I might as well go shaman for the full flavor
---
And now you have clearly shown you have no idea what actual RP is about.
---
Feel free to "RP" with NPCs and unsuspecting players of opposite faction who have no idea world PvP fight they had was seen as roleplay by the opposite side that just ganked them.
---
Partially because said paladin was jumping around like a headless chicken.
---
Loved me a good NE priest 
---
They just don't have useful pve / fury racials the same way that humans do. That wep skill is enormous from humans. 
---
So warriors can Taunt &gt; Mocking Blow &gt; Taunt . The chance of you resisting all three of those in a row is very very low. Its fine to have a mage pull like this. However, if it is a big pack, you do the initial bow pull so the rest of mobs chase you. Then the DPSer pumps skull and you taunt it. 
---
Druid is the true hybrid class in vanilla. That's the way you need to approach that. The answer to your question is, it depends. Druids have a luxury that almost no other class has, and that's the fact that your are a few fungible talent points away from being an optimal dps/healer, tank/healer, or mix of dps/tank/healer. That's just for PvE, and your options expand in regards to PvP as well. There isn't a cookie cutter best 0/30/21 talent spread, because there isn't a cookie cutter best way too play a druid. If you're playing a druid, you need to understand that your job is to fill in the gaps in your groups jobs. Druids don't do anything better than other specific classes, but they do everything better than any other class. 
---
This is one of those things that sounds like it would be great fun, but is in no way realistic... and the fun would wear off very quickly.
---
i think 0/30/21 druids are still the better FC and also can heal raids fine.
---
Vanish on cool down. Blind was resisted. 
---
You could swap with OP..
---
But is it more popular among actual roleplayers or just people who "want more mature PvP server"?
---
addendum
---
make it into a macro and add a line to targets yourself after the ability of your choosing
---
you can't use melee swings / auto shots on friendly targets and suppress basic attacks like that without the need for quirky mouse/keybind turnings
---
The tier 1 prot talent for reduced rage cost of Sunder Armor is nice since it allows the woyer to stack some sunders on 2-3 different target right away.
---
But for general dungeon running that's not really a fatal scenario so maybe it's not necessary.
---
Wait, are you guys \*not\* planning on running Windows XP for Classic? #nochanges
---
Attaboy
---
My biggest issue is that I want to play a Pally in classic. My friend who got me into this game wants to go Horde. 
---
And I have another friend who will probably want to play Shaman. So i'm going to be torn. I've been debating how I want to do this.. As I primarily prefer to heal, so I think I'll level the 4 healers up. Human Pally, Undead Priest, Night Elf Druid, Tauren Shaman. 
---
And the worst part? I probably won't even get to my Pally until last. Oh well. This is why we have rested experience! I'm going to definitely enjoy rested feeling like it matters again.

The point of pre raid BiS lists is to get these items before the raid. If you're rushing to get into some of the first raids, you simply don't have the time to farm out all of the absolute BiS items for every slot.
---
Once you start raiding and viskags and preds start dropping all these pre BiS list will quickly become irrelavent.
---
So having slightly weaker alternatives is very important.
---
Sure I could have said that it's ONE of the pre raid BiS weapons or something a long those lines, but that's just getting nitpicky. If it's on the pre BiS list, most people refer to it as "pre BiS" item.
---
Sorry for not being technically correct.
---
lmao dude you don't know me
---
The only pathetic thing is your desire to feel better about your own existence by putting down others
---
Kindly go fuck a blender
---
Also, it's important to remember that a hard counter for a druid means "I should run away" not "I'm going to die". 
---
druid is the less dependant class on gear tho...
---
thats fair, sorry i didnt see it in the rules. i appreciate yall being polite about it.
---
Lol,
---
Good luck filling a raid with anyone much less filtering out by ilevel

I think (and hope) he means that he wont be able to commit to a guild or regular grp so is expecting have to pug and never do "hard" content. 
---
Most ppl wait till the cloth turn in for two and buy the mount with another character and store it till then
---
Not gonna lie, as a horde player from the start I still don't consider blood elves part of the horde.
---
It will be enabled.
---
Thank you very VERY much for all this. You cleared up my foggy mind so much. I'm going for warrior
---
You are welcome :)
---
There are many misconceptions among players on this subreddit about what RP actually is and how it works, so it´s always great to know someone gets something out of my lengthy explanations.
---
How much skill does it take to play a Feral Druid well in PvP compared to other classes like Mage, Lock and Hunter?
---
hi folks, do u think omen of clarity is really needed to level fast? as i wanna go 0/30/21 to get used to it and pvp a lot while leveling.
---
Horde's likely to have the same benefits as on retail, most of the quality players will go to it even if alliance has some pve benefits.
---
Windows ME for life
---
I actually think it is the way you say it is.
---
RpPvE servers are much more about Rp the way you describe it where as RpPvP servers are general immersion servers. Rp is part of that but not as heavily as on RpPvE servers.
---
I care more about general immersion than Rp and happily sacrifice some of the Rp aspects I like for a more immersive open world experience thanks to non consensual PvP. It's a good mix of both.
---
Thank you 
---
Of course, spirit and stam... of the whale baby!

It's like Master's degrees. I know some real dumb mother fuckers with Master's degrees. They aren't smart but they sure are persistent.

I agree, and i fully believe that it was in retail vanilla.  Another thing my friend said was that a lot of spells (particularly healing) were totally wrong and stronger on private servers.  For example regrowth was getting +100% bonus healing on the initial cast as well as the HoT which was apparently wrong
---
He said the only reason he's gonna play classic is cos of these differences and it hopefully being harder, otherwise he wouldn't bother 
---
Came here for this.  Was not disappointed.
---
Well, after 5 or so raid tiers (including the .5s) you have to get an expansion anyway, because the gear differences are getting way too big between new and older players. I believe that if Classic is a success, Blizz will launch BC, eventually WotLK, and after a couple of years they could actually create a WoW.2.0 based on the same Azeroth world, which would emulate Vanilla in terms of gameplay. Who knows ? Classic wasn't even launched yet, so there isn't that much to discuss, really.
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **6th Cakeday** IGawtsFoTeef! ^(hug)
---
But the quirky player controlled movements is what gave these tricks their fun/style and sense of skill! The movement isn't too bad, you just run through them at the same time you use your ability and you're automatically facing the wrong direction to auto swing, or just a quick click into the ground too. 
---
Not knocking macros, but I've just never been a fan of them
---
I unironically would run win xp if I could :( Still the best windows ever made.
---
I'm not gonna lie, I think the closest person in this thread to being "triggered" is you. 
---
I'm also not sure that word means but you think it means. 
---
All dwarves are born beautiful.
---
absorbed dmg does - and we are getting 1.12 classic so no 2.0.1 rage normalization. Meaning you get less rage for weaker hits against you - and less rage for dealing out weak hits (aka all warriors and bears coming from private servers are in for a big shock when the big old 'Not enough rage' demon returns to haunt them)
---
As explanation. 2.0.1 changed the rage generation to flat numbers. If you use varies weapons with the same swing speed they will all produce the same amount of rage regardless of the dmg output. This made it much easier to balance warriors moving forward. 
---
So far I haven't seen a single clip from a private server with the old vanilla rage formula on them. (probably so they don't scare off customers - or because the normalized values are simply easier to process for the servers)
---

---
Thats cool and all, but could you actually put something substantial and quantifiable behind anything you claim, rather than just tossing around anecdotes? 
---
The absolute worst part of alliance in vanilla is the damn boats... zeppelins are infinitely more convenient and cool
---
It's actually not very complicated. I think you're overthinking it. It wasn't in vanilla, so why on earth would they add it to classic? It would really change the essence and feeling of Classic, and also introduce new, however minor, gameplay elements which weren't originally present.
---
Of course. Don´t get me wrong, I think RP-PvP server(s) should be a thing, even if people want them for reasons unconnected to roleplay and I respect that you want your experience to be how you just described it.
---
It just grinds my gears when I see people talk about "what´s right in roleplay" and how RPers should behave while clearly showing they never participated in RP and their idea of RP is basically comparable to doing good/bad Geralt run in Witcher III or Dark/Light Side Jedi Knight in SWtOR.
---
Rp is roleplaying that's it. How you define it exactly doesn't matter to me. I just play the game in more of a way how my character would go about it. Completely divorcing Rp and the game is not what it should be about. You can easily combine the two in some regards (not all of course). Rp can be spontaneous with other players and in some instances can be done alone. There are more than enough Roleplayers who do this in Elder Scrolls or Fallout for example. Coming up with a backstory and playing it out within the game.
---
But stop acting like an asshat who knows how to "properly" play the game. There is no proper way. That is up to each individual.
---
if anybody cared to look, sure. 
---
&gt;We all know blizz loves to talk about RP related issues.
---
??
---
Do they? Because I feel like it's the exact opposite lol
---
&gt;But once you got it I dont want anymore diccussions about it. I'm done talking about Rp stuff. 
---
Sir yes sir!
---
**O7**
---
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir!
---
The dislikes on my posts disagree with you.  
---
I'm also not sure that word means but you think it means.
---
it was intentional and was removed with BC with the addition of cloak of shadows (hence why you can find so many posts in old forums of 2007 about crying rogues wanting their old vanish back
---
This. 
---
Ahhhh.... techno Titanic.  One of the favourite go to's for kill videos.
---
It looks like it would! But as per the blue post that OP linked, they removed the ability for the target command to work on totems.
---
Same boat you're in. My whole guild is "we don't really care but we prefer horde." Even though we were ally for years.
---
I'm having trouble on whether or not I'll still roll if they go horde but it's better to have old friends than faction I guess...
---
Trying to see it as going horde for the first time ever. Something I didn't really do. A new experience.
---
I sincerely hope they have one at launch. I actually didn't even expect them not to, until they came out saying they weren't sure if they would. 
---
Having high latency in 2019 will make it feel even more like 2005 tbh
---
Oh, so now you are telling RPers that they should completely change how they RP, because they can´t divorce RP and the game?
---
Who is the asshat here?
---
Tier 1? What talent tree are you looking at? It’s tier 4, you need 15 points in the tree before you get to improved sunder. 
---
The tier 1 prot talents are garbage. Prot is for level 60 only. 
---
Fuck I can't wait!
---
Yeah, but with no cooldown and unlimited charges if I remember correctly.
---
I see!
---
That doesn’t sound too bad...^as ^a ^warrior ^main
---
I don't think you can use it during combat?
---
They are not anecdotes. Go take a look at some of discussions on this subreddit about this topic and try to find roleplayers among all those who want to get immersed, want mature servers, want to take it slow etc.
---
sounds pretty normal to be honest. The dot on you has nothing to do with the combat timer. If the caster doesn't manage to wand you or put another dot on you. Then you have that short time window
---
&gt; you simply don't have the time to farm out all of the absolute BiS items for every slot.
---
Sure, but that doesn't mean the definition of what actually is BiS changes.
---
&gt; So having slightly weaker alternatives is very important.
---
Agreed, no one is saying otherwise.
---
&gt; Sorry for not being technically correct.
---
All good fam.  It just bothers me how gaming communities tend to bastardize words into meaninglessness.  "Viable" used to mean something very specific, until people misused it to the point that now it's totally conflated with "Optimal."  Underpowered, Overpowered, and Broken used to have distinctly different meanings as well, until people pointlessly exaggerated problems to the point that they mean the same thing.  Trying to do my part to preserve meaning here!
---
There's almost no way Blizzard will go down that route 
---
What does that do? Does having a lot of spirit make evocation more potent?
---
Too pretty?
---
I loved the way my female BE lock looked in my t8.5 gear.(I earned that gear the hard way)
---
But my favorite look was definitely my gobbie rogue in the t2 transmit I spent a month and a half farming.
---
When classic hits in rolling a ud rogue and am totally going for the t2 set. It's going to take forever, but I want to raid classic like nobodies business.
---
I expect new players, and possibly older players who forgot how aggro worked, will be in for a shock at just how easy it was to pull aggro off of someone. I haven't seriously played since wotlk so it may be that way now. I just remember having to manage my aggro and fading a lot, especially when fury was not built up yet.
---
The Sophie’s Choice of WoW.
---
No, it's not even an issue. I play on EU servers from Asia on retail and it is perfectly playable both in PvE HL and PvP. Got the same timing problem as OP though.
---
I agree, but I don't see how people do the good/bad thing in WoW. People come up with a backstory and incorporate this backstory in their gameplay to some extent.
---
Everyone should play the game the way they want which is why we need all 4 server types.
---
As far as I see it the server attract kind of the following type
---
PvP: the average people who want to play the game and more competitive tpyes
---
PvE: People who care solely about the endgame or who can't play a lot/ don't want many obstables in the game
---
Rp: People who care heavily about Rp and not so much about the game in general
---
RpPvP: People who are heavily invested in the immersion of the game.
---
just an offer to make life easier if you want to ;)
---
I respect the attitude though. I've never used a FD trap macro - just by using hotkeys in close proximity and the knowledge that FD isn't on the GCD. So I get the notion behind it
---
I'll take invincible pill and wait for Legion servers! 👌 🔥
---
I think that there’s something to be said for the fact that there will always be demand for vanilla wow. But classic wow must evolve or die at some point, OSRS was going to kick the bucket if they hadn’t started making updates. 
---
Re-read his posts. You can't conduct a "DnD adventure" in-game on PvP servers without running the risk of getting ganked. You just can't. PvE servers offer a safe place to enact these "DnD adventures", like the example of the mages in Duskwood Dorlas gave.
---
You're thinking too strictly within the game mechanics. Dorlas' kind of RP cannot be done with the game mechanics, yours can. I like your kind of RP, I never was much into the "DnD adventure" kind but even I can realize what the fuck Dorlas is saying.
---
Mr. Moneybags over here! 💰 
---
I raided in vanilla. The buffs definitely helped in progression fights, and I was constantly hitting consumables when we had them. Not really needed though. At least not until AQ40 and Naxx. 
---
No I'm saying they should choose the server type they prefer and then play the game how they like it. If you want to totally divorce Rp and gameplay that's fine with me, but don't say the other way is a weird way of approaching the game.
---
I think we shared our perspectives. No need to continue this. 
---
It was a nice conversation. Let's hope we all get the servers we want.
---
Hey I'm in this raid! This brings backs memories
---
bet you spent all day doing this
---
If not, you will get VERY close.
---
There’s a way to filter quests on classic wowhead, those will tell you what quests give org rep and what level they are.
---
You may have to map out your own leveling circuit, but I think you could do it, theoretically. 
---
Lol appreciate it :) 
---
Yeah man, I don't have a mass of knowledge about server architecture, but I have friends that do. The core issue with retail servers is that Blizzard prioritized client side stability over high pop optimization. So when retail encounters a high population density, it divides it into 2 virtual servers instead of one, in order to prevent the server from getting flooded with inputs. This process is called sharding, and that is what Blizzards current server is optimized for. They prioritized keeping your frames and ping stable over you being able to see everybody. It is a design decision and not a hardware limitation. Hopefully I explained that a bit better.
---
Way to stand up for the Horde...
---
Yep. I dont think il be able to take a full week off such short notice, but a couple days for sure. If it drops on say a thursday or friday I plan on taking the following monday and tuesdsy off. 
---
Life hack.
---
I mean technically it has a buff duration I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head.  and then goes on cooldown.. but correct me if I'm wrong isn't it like 65% to hit at base anyway? I'm at work I'd have to look at it when I get home I haven't messed around on the druid for a bit. 
---
How the hell do you gear for PVP as a HOTW Druid? People say INT/STAM, but if you were healing MC, would you get any of that gear there? 
---
Indeed
---
I did SW only quests on my dwarf and only hit revered with SW at level 26.  It would be very difficult but maybe?
---
Hi, /u/Benleking
---
ahhh ok, i wasn't sure if dots kept you in combat or not
---
Good idea, but I think joining a random PuG will give you the same experience.
---
Its a joke toworths the Retail Q&amp;A, I know they are diffrent teams but in those Q&amp;A's they always awnser one or two RP related questions taking up 5 to 10 minutes while the mayority ( bases on chat, comments and reactions ) dont want them to discuss RP related stuff for so long because so many other aspects of the game are questionable.
---
Hope you get your realm tho.
---
Tactical Mastery will be more helpful while tanking leveling dungeons than nearly any prot talents.
---
You misunderstood me. There is nothing wrong with doing the good/bad thing (or any other example from RPGs where you can take multiple paths by basically creating your version of the character) in WoW by creating a backstory and incorporating it to their gameplay.
---
My issue is that these people think it´s how RP in WoW works and how roleplayers are pussies or don´t understand the world by picking normal RP servers.
---
HOTW ive seen as  a very popular spec for people, and while its OK at doing healing / tanking, its watered down version of both. This is magnified by the fact that druids are already a watered down version of whatever role you're filling. For pvp I would never recommend HOTW. 
---
What crawled in your ass? He's obviously just being jokingly edgy. When Allys say our houses are made from shit and we got them walking gangrenes we know it's all in good nature. You'll pay for it ofc.
---
There was a blue post about this a while ago. You won't receive them but they were considering another way for CE owners to get their pets again, don't think they ever followed up though
---
I realized what he was saying. I have just another approach to Rp and the game in general, which he, in the beginning, saw as quite weird, while it's just a different way to go about rp in the game.
---
RpPvE is more strictly scripted and PvP can disturb that, I get it. I just think that open world PvP adds a layer of immersion to the game in general. Since roleplaying is not just about scripten roleplaying events but also an immersive world, I prefer RpPvP.
---
This is no way to conduct an argument: You can't just keep asking me for proof to back up my own claim, yet at the same time refuse to substantiate your own.
---
I would be genuinely interested in actual proof that there are more interest in RP-PvE servers over RP-PvP - because I don't want to level to 60 on a server that will be dead 3 weeks after release, as such im a lot more invested in figuring out the most likely population balance come release, rather than "winning" some random internet argument... But you're literally bring nothing of substance to the argument, and that's a shame.
---
I got hit exhaulted on my dreanei shaman at level 44 for night elfs doing every single quest I could find while leveling up
---
This was during TBC but relatively the same as vanilla
---
Druids are often dismissed by people who say that they don't want to be a watered down warrior rogue or caster.  Those people are missing the point.  You are a watered down rouge, warrior AND caster.  A jack of all trades class has a place in vanilla.  You can always play as the counter class to whatever you are fighting.  If you are a cat druid or a bear druid, you're doing it wrong.  Druids are the masters of versatility, which is undervalued by a lot of people in classic.  It's nice to bring a DPS to raids that can OT, heal and decurse when needed.
---
Anyone who dismisses druids as "jack of all trades, master of none" is forgetting the second part of the saying: "better that than a master of one."
---
Absolutely my favorite class.
---
This was the hope but no word yet on reforged timeline except its before end of year
---
This is all dumb.  As someone who actually played back in the day, all of this already happened.
---
Camping mobs is pvp, stop complaining.  Same faction griefing might be a bit borderline there, but still they have to kill you if you tag the mob, and it is easy enough to out dps sheep regen ticks on sheep spam.
---
People Que dodged and shared accounts back then too.  Ganking lowbies is fine as it is expected.  The risk of a dishonorable kill balances it out.
---
Vanilla was all about wacky items.  I am pretty sure I had 10-20 utility items at any time.  Nothing new here.
---
Alts are nothing new either.
---
World Buffs are meh and are way overstated.  Most guilds getting a dps buff will not help them progress, as their shortcomings are usually Tank related or execution related.  People are also overvaluing Resistance gear, but that is another rabbit hole for later.
---
GoldFarming.  All of this is PS values and PS mobs.  The mara run is like 5-10g per 10 mins.  Was it BC that introduced instance reset caps?
---
No disrespect, but you sound like you never played original wow.
---
You cant but to can feign death + shadowmeld and eat/drink
---
bur
---
Like I said, I don't see anything wrong with what you describe and don't see these types of players as pussies. I participate in this type of Rp but also like to incorporate Rp in my gameplay to some extent.
---
Yea I feel like I should change as well. Guess it will be a decision I make at release lol. I still really want my damn Nemesis Helm... killed Ony so many fucking times and never got it. But I don't have as much time to play anymore so not sure I will really get that point anyways. 
---
You know, that's a great idea! I never got into the RTS Warcraft games and I've missed out on a lot of Warcraft lore by not playing the campaigns.
---
I could realistically see myself playing through a remastered WC3 just to see what it's all about and get some deeper understanding of the lore.
---
Ahhh, sneaky!
---
I doubt we'll see WC3R before Q3. If they had planned to release it prior to Classic we would have some information by now.
---
after 10 years of classic, i think blizz should release emerald dream and kara expansions, even if in a different server
---
This guide is outdated for vanilla 1.12. (maul has a cooldown in the guide while it has none in 1.12)
---
What is vanilla 1.12 tanking rotation?
---
you dont need clarity at all
---
I wouldn't pay much mind to them. They're probably from /r/wow and those types have a tendancy to pretend that adding changes are fine, if you are against these changes you're literally Garithos, even if these changes may affect you, someone else, or be in conflict with the literal goals of the project.
---
Druids are consistently the least played class. So if you are a druid, its always easy to find a spot - assuming you're willing to play resto.
---
Main focus will be PvE. Hoping to make friends to level together. Everything i have watch/read seems to lead toward soloing most levels and only group for a dungeon or raid. Hope i can find a buddy or two to level with
---
I am the senate!
---
Still as good as I remember it 12 years later.
---
"I don't plan on raiding"
---
"raid gear is OP"
---
Congratz mate, you just played yourself 
---
You don't need prot talents. If you're dying in a dungeon then blame the healer.
---
I'll only comment on these two classes since these are the only two you seem interested in. If you want suggestions on other classes just let me know. You also didn't mention PvP in your post so I will just assume you will want to casually PvP. If you're not planning to PvP at all or minimally, that could impact your decision.
---
Warrior I usually only recommend for hardcore players or players consistently playing with a group, because it's a class that doesn't have a lot of self-reliance. They are the slowest/hardest class to get to 60. They are very gear reliant, they are expensive, they aren't great in 1v1 PvP because they are easily controlled, and they require raid gear to really shine. Prot is definitely an option at 60, but keep in mind that you can tank dungeons at 60 as any warrior spec, as long as you're using a shield and D-stance and the correct abilities. You only really need to be Prot for raiding, but being Prot will of course help immensely if tanking is how you want to spend a majority of your time. Even if you are Prot for raiding, the spots are very limited. So you may want to consider a different warrior spec that will allow you to DPS in raids, be more formidable in PvP, and faster leveling. You said you didn't want to play something requiring a huge time-investment, but I would argue Warriors are one of the most high investment classes since they are so gear reliant and slow to level and group oriented. If you can commit the time and effort, Warriors are definitely worth it since geared Warriors will top the damage meters and are wrecking balls in PvP (if they have heals and dispels backing them up). But depending on how much time you see yourself being able to spend, this may not ever be a reality for you, and you may just be envious of your warrior peers who can spend the time they require.
---
Hunter seems like a much better fit for your needs. They are the fastest leveling class and strong soloers thanks to pets and feign death and your pet. They aren't as gear reliant as Warriors are, and have very good DPS as a fresh 60, though they scale with gear poorly. I wouldn't worry about not finding a spot in a pug or guild. Hunters are not a shunned class by any means, and you sound like you will be a more casual player so you wont be looking for a raid spot in a hardcore pve or pvp guild. Another perk is MM Hunters have a pretty versatile spec that allows them to PvP and PvE without respeccing. Hunters do have some mechanics to get used to, like the dead zone and traps and pet management. They also have a pretty high skill cap in both PvP and PvE, where you need to be able to kite while weaving abilities between auto attacks and strafing, but definitely not a boring rotation like several other specs in the game. Hunters scale poorly with gear, so while you'll be strong in the early stages of Classic with lesser gear compared to other classes, you will be weaker compared to other DPS classes in the late stages of Vanilla with stronger gear. However, you said you don't expect to do high end raiding for a long time, so this is actually kind of favorable. You're a lot more capable in PvP 1v1 than Warrior, which may be important to you especially if you're on a PvP server.
---
So if you want to tank, or if you don't mind a longer grind or money/time invested to increase your character's power, you should go Warrior. If you want a more relaxed and faster leveling experience, more independence, and a less intensive gearing requirement in exchange for a lower power scaling, I would go Hunter. 
---
The only one that didn't have enough quests for Exalted 1-60 was Trolls IIRC. Faction wide quest rep and turn ins solve that issue though.
---
Yes, but, Horde have an advantage in AB. They have a faster, more direct route to BS, which is a central (literally) base to capture.
---
By contrast, the distances of LM and GM are the same for Horde and Alliance, so it’s not like Alliance is compensated for the BS being closer to Horde.
---
Competitive edge to what?  It's not a fucking race.  People that make it so are fucking pathetic.
---
You completely misunderstood my argument. I am not saying those servers will be dead on arrival, rather that most players who ask for them and will be playing on them aren´t roleplayers, but rather people who want more mature servers or any other reason I described and that roleplayers are in huge minority among this population.
---
And I am not going to spend hours searching for every thread about RP-PvP server on this subreddit, gathering them and linking them in one long comment, combined with analysis on how many comments were coming from people who wanted those servers because they would be RPing on them. I have neither time, will or energy to do that only to persuade you that I am right.
---
If you want to get information about reasons why people want to play on RP-PvP servers, search option is there for you. But pie chart stating that 7% of Classic subreddit wants to play on RP-PvP servers says nothing about reasons why people want to play there.
---
I guess you are NA then?
---
I have 20-30ms.
---
Duo is the fastest way as a rogue and warrior yes.
---
Just one rp-pvp server please, its not much to ask.
---
(bur)
---
I'm in danger.
---
DK main for the longest time (though I only arena with my rogue now.) Had a 110 dh with legion, hated it. Simplistic game play, and way to green. I don't like green, so it was easy to switch. 
---
I was an orc hunter, Yohnstoppabl. I mostly ganked people in Silithis. 
---
Thanks for the big write up. 
---
If I’m taking a couple days off of work to no-life the game with a buddy (he’d play mage) at launch, does that change your opinion?
---
I mean I could understand if they provided you with an alternative to packed zones to avoid the large amount of players that will zerg the typical leveling routes. But my point being.. the fastest route already exists and I don't think an alternative route just to avoid people for 5 levels or whatever exists (that can effectively compete with the amount of EXP the already known route provides you with).
---
I would like to actually read at least one part of the guide just to understand why anyone would pay money for it, I don't see why that's bad.
---
Also just to point it out, I never downvote replies to my posts so that's not me doing it.
---
&gt;Restoration forces you to wear cloth
---
Played Resto Shaman in Vanilla. Raided everything, first half of AQ40, 1 boss of Naxx, never wore cloth.
---
If this were to delay classic at all, then nah, I'm good. If not, great idea.
---
In what type of soil does a human bean get planted? Does it require sunlight? How often should said bean be watered? 
---
People very rarely talk outside of orcish except for RP though
---
yeah, lets not give them any ideas.
---
I've played from NA with 160 ms and it was never that big of an issue.
---
This is just "DAE pservers bad" shitpost

I wouldn't mind that being gone, but maybe the no changes crowd would disagree. It is easy as shit to kill totems while a shaman is scattershot, though. If a tremor totem gets rid of your freezing trap, you did something wrong.
---
Not only can I imagine it, I *dream* of it.
---
Virtually overnight from the time they were added we went from a Horde filled mostly with orcs and undead but no small amount of trolls and tauren to the freaking blood elves being roughly as popular as *all the other races combined.* Suddenly all the vapid, shallow cusses I'd rolled Horde specifically to get away from were *everywhere.* And it literally made the game less fun for me.
---
Yes, I'm being salty, but I truly loathe what the introduction of the blood elves did to the game, as well as to the character of the Horde player base (at least on my server).
---
I've said it before and I stand by it: if the only thing keeping someone from rolling Horde is a belief none of the available races are "pretty enough," that person doesn't belong in the Horde in the first place.
---
I leveled as enhancement in Vanilla. Ended up raiding as Resto. It's super fun to level Enh. You will dominate random world PVP, especially against casters. If you plan on taking your time anyways, I would 100% recomend it. The Blue Staff from WC quest is one of the best 2 handers you can get early on, and you can probably get a decent staff and hold off on the 2h axe/mace talent until you get to 45 or 50 if you already had something decent. 
---
It absolutely is. Around 2007 I got a Dwarf exalted with Darnassus at level 39 by doing all the quests that give Darnassus rep.  
---
Take a look though this list here and do all the quests at their appropriate level.

---
If you know what you're doing, solo leveling is always faster, even as a warrior.
---
This has been observed scientifically 
---
Same situation for me.  Been playing Horde for ages now, but I still can hardly stand Orgrimmar.
---
I definitely recall that name. I also remember Bubbalobrown being the most annoying feral on the server out in silithus lol.
---
Dear everyone: NOBODY is saying you need to min max. NOBODY is saying you need to tryhard. Play as casually as you like but stop it with this straw man shit. It's pathetic.
---
&gt; Savage Fury (Not as good as it sounds)
---
What about if you are doing a 0/30/21 build with an emphasis on tanking as the secondary aspect? Is Savage Fury still good then for Swipe and Maul? I know if you want a tanking emphasis, you also want to go around 3/5 on Thick Hide, so does Savage Fury still not enter consideration then as well?
---
Tauren is the only horde race i can play 😖
---
You can kill more mobs before having to stop to drink/eat if you have a pocket healer.  It more than makes up for sharing the so.
---
I've never been one for RP servers, but I do see the appeal of playing with maybe a more mature player base on that type of server. It would be silly for them not to exist.
---
You're an enigma to me.
---
Exactly. IMO, the whole reason RPvP is seen as such a niche community in the first place is precisely because Blizzard didn't add it as an option until nearly a year after the game had launched. By which point most people had already established themselves and built connections on other servers, and most of them felt it wasn't worth abandoning that.
---
The only way to accurately judge the popularity of and demand for RPvP is to have at least one server available *at launch* in every major region. Otherwise they're simply repeating the selfsame mistake that kneecapped its potential popularity in the first place.
---
Typically it seems we're the older crowd without as much gaming time that'll be taking months to get to 60 (from previous conversations).
---
Interesting, why do you say those healers over a priest?
---
Nah, not without dynamic respawns.
---
Same and same.
---
fuck your friend go ally
---
This is what makes me think it would be faster for duo since warriors have to stop to recover quite often
---
indeed. you will make new friends!
---
You’re addicted to a drug and can’t deal with normal life without a substance to alter or enhance it. You’re super weak... it’s really sad man. Try living clean if you can. I hate to see wasted potential :)
---
GOOD LUCK I’m rooting for you my man!
---
Windows 7 was pretty okay once you got to know it. Everything after that it's straight up trash. Fuck Cortana, the windows store, Xbox integration, and "please rate the calculator app"
---
Sure, go for it. 
---
Yes play what you want
---
Agreed, Alliance are truly the best faction and have never shitposted or done any of the abhorrent actions these mudhut backwards horde players do.
---
[Its not like the most top rated post on this subreddit is a shitpost meme on horde players.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b9lyfc/i_choose_horde_for_the_pvp_racials_starter_pack/)
---
Alliance players would never stoop to such toxicity like those edgy horde teenagers. lel.
---
&gt; Enhancement has zero mobility, no reliant damage, only a slow as CC. You basically rely on walking up to people and hoping to oneshot them, you are basically a worse reckonng paladin.
---
"I didn't ask for your opinion"
---
0 CC, 0 mobility, gets kited to death, their only gimmick is 1-shotting people with something that's completely RNG. That's not opinion, that's facts.
---
It's hard to prove because you're plugging your finger in your ears and ignoring facts.
---
Human Priests Got that Spirit Buff!
---
yes
---
Fair is fair, I definitely agree that a large portion of those wanting to play on a RP-PvP server aren't interested in engaging with the RP community (although the same can be said for RP servers, to a lesser extent).
---
It still does not change the fact that your opinion is anecdotal; You have no way of reliably estimate the reasons people are interested in playing on RP-PvP servers. But even if you could: What would it matter? All that matters is that a large section of the playerbase, for whatever reason, wants to play on RP-PvP servers. It's 3 additional letters in a tag, just let them.
---
Awh man, this has gotten out of hand. Absolutely, you will have no trouble finding a group as a human priest. 
---
A reason which has absolutely nothing to do with the fact RPvP servers weren't made available until 1.8, nearly a year after the game had launched, by which point everyone had already established themselves and made connections on other servers, thus kneecapping RPvP's potential popularity right out the gate.
---
The only way to truly gauge the popularity of and demand for RPvP is to have it available as an option *at launch.* Otherwise Blizz will simply be repeating the selfsame mistake that led to it being seen as such a niche community in the first place.
---
TBC boosted reputation gain for the main factions considerably.
---
Makes sense to me, thank you for your input!
---
Yeah balancing BGs is a WHOLE other animal.  I dont have a doh solution to this one.  BGs are really complicated.  
---
However, balancing factions on any given server would go a long way to help with BG queues.

 Druids are the keepers of the world. Locked in slumber for generations, they awoke to meet the threat of the Burning Legion during its recent invasion. After Archimonde's defeat, the Druids chose to remain in the waking world and help to rebuild their shattered lands. The Legion's attack left a terrible scar on the natural order, and the Druids seek to heal it.

---
Lots of downtime during Vanilla leveling. 👌🏻
---
Yes. Pay no heed to the minmaxers. What works for them works for them, but the vast majority of guilds will not be refusing to take you raiding because you rolled Human.
---
They’re seriously the coolest looking ones. People only play orcs for their racial, undead for their racial and i guess looks, and no one plays troll. Trolls are up next for me probably
---
Well, they have CC and mobility and kiting ability so....you dont know the definition of "fact"
---
&gt;2 ounces of purp babyyyyyyyy
---
You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers
---
I know this is not the same, but for me it filled the itch:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AH8Nl7Ehjo
---
This guy has videos put together of all the cinematic videos, mission intros, important dialogue during missions etc from warcraft 3. They are split into separate videos for each campaign/story in wc3, and each video ranges from 20 minutes to an hour.
---
It's not the same as playing, but for some of us it is more convenient.
---
&gt; isn't it like 65% to hit at base anyway?
---
it was 35%, as far as I remember. And I think the duration was 1 minunte
---
Yeah I would drop Feline Swiftness and put them into Savage Fury for what you are suggesting. I take Savage Fury when I make a tank but when going for a Powershifting Cat DPS spec.
---
Nope!
---
Another side effect of devs having more time to flesh out Alliance.  Seems like in general Alliance has a lot more gimmicky items than horde in general.
---
Orb of Deception might fit. Cosmetic change to turn you into the opposite faction.
---
Me either, they ruined the ugly aesthetic. All we had in my day was the female troll w/ the pretty face and thats how we liked it.
---
Earthbind totem is CC
---
Ghostwolf is mobility
---
Frostshock in combo with the above makes kiting them more difficult.
---
Those "facts" you mentioned turned out to be horseshit.  What else ya got?
---
No Friends = No Problems
---
Keep in mind that Horde has no access to Fear Ward and they have raided just fine.
---
If you're just playing casually, doing dungeons and pvp then sure it could be faster and it will certainly be easier than solo leveling warrior.
---
But you're trying to level quickly and efficiently, solo is always faster
---
&gt;Are we looking at a state of emergency?
---
Nah, the dude who types up the memo will be at home playing WoW too
---
Yeah kind of. It brought in a lot of people who just wanted elves and not the edgelords I want from my ugly races horde.
---
Big talk from faction kyphosis
---
I'm rolling NE priest and I'm proud of it. You are going to look at your character for hundreds maybe thousands of hours so absolutely pick what you think looks best. From my experience even on pservers which are known for being full of min/maxers you see priest of all races in raids spots. 
---
if you're leveling, you should be making use of your hearthstone in strategic spots, like at the quest hub where you're at, or the other continent if you're returning there after a bit. if the hearthstone point is close, then you would bubblehearth. if it was far away, then don't. if you leave your hearth in stormwind the entire time you level, then yeah, bubblehearthing is often not useful.
---
World first will 100% be a Mage, as evidenced with the last Fresh run. &lt;APES&gt; Mage was obliterating some try-hard leveler Hunter. You won’t be seeing typical AoE grind spots with random ranged opponents. Believe what you want about how private servers are so much different than retail, though.

^^ This was in the sub-Reddit earlier, and had impressed me the most of all druid PvP videos I've seen so far. He's using Noggenfogger and Deviate Fish to hide his form shifting and dances between humanoid caster, bear, cat, travel, seal(?) and I'm not sure because of the disguise if he's actually far enough into Balance to have Moonkin. 
---
I see he's spec'd into Feral Charge, though. Truly a hybrid PvP'er, but the focus seems to be deeply balance.
---
Yikes, thought there would be more in the 35-40 bracket
---
Absolutey play what you want.  Do not subscribe to the min/max unless you want that to be your play style.  
---
And in doing so they'll be making the selfsame mistake that kneecapped the potential popularity of RPvP and led to the perception of it being such a niche community in the first place.
---
The only way to accurately gauge the popularity of and demand for RPvP is to make it an option *at launch.* Even if it's just the one server for each region (I'd prefer two so I can play both factions, but I'm willing to settle for one just to have the chance to prove there are enough of us to justify adding more).
---
I'd like to join, but I don't meet the experience requirements. Guilds these days, and their requirements... 
---
I hope to got they won't be. Forgetting anything to do with ##changes bullshit, this was so stupid back in the day.
---
The alternative being a faction dominated by Chucky wannabes?
---
&gt; CC
---
Yeah... Frost Shock and Earthbind. Every other class has hard CC instead of only 50% slows.
---
&gt; Mobility
---
I don't think you know what that means. Even warriors have better mobility because they have Charge+Intercept. Running at someone in Ghost Wolf isn't mobility.
---
&gt; Kiting Ability
---
They aren't going to kite anyone with a brain with a 50% slow and nothing else. You're confusing PVE kiting and PVP kiting now.
---
At this point you have either absolutely no clue what you're talking about or making shit up... or both.
---
Troll harder, n00b.
---
Shit, man, sounds like this is happening EVERYWHERE. I fear a huge faction imbalance. I too planned on playing Alliance. I fucking hate Horde with a passion. But my friend has 1.5 months to play, so I’ll have to roll with him first on Horde and switch back to Alliance on another server when his classes resume. 
---
I still feel like Horde had much more advantages and were a more favored faction by Blizzard.
---
Shamans counter Paladins
---
Undead Rogues counter locks (but Alliance rogues don’t counter Horde locks)
---
Anything orc counters Alliance rogues.
---
Shamans get 40% speed increase at level 20 - highest speed increase at level 20 (very early) of any class.
---
Thunderbluff is an easy, quick run away from Orgrimar, and there’s a zeppelin from Undercity to Orgrimar, while Alliance have to run through Dun Morogh, Loch Modan, and Wetlands (level 30ish zone) to get to/from Darnassus. 
---
Horde have safe leveling via Barrens to level 25 while Alliance get forced into PvP as early as 16-18 for Redridge and Ashenvale (seems Blizzard really wants Horde to pwn some lowbies). And while you can argue that Hillsbrad Foothills is a level 22ish questing zone for Horde and level 30 for Alliance, Horde can go to Barrens, while Alliance don’t have that luxury, AND Duskwood is like RIGHT THERE for STV gankers. Oh, and by the way, a huge outpost in the middle of STV for Horde with a zeppelin even though Booty Bay is there, neutral for both factions, while we have 2 tents and 3 guards at the very top of STV with no FP or boat there. Arathi Highlands has retarded Alliance generals, because they decided to make an outpost in a fucking ditch that people can stand over and nuke people at the bottom, while Horde have an outpost on a hill AND with high fences. 
---
Sure, Alliance has advantage in AV, thank god we had at least THAT - but Horde have advantage in AB with a bullshit Blacksmith being closer to Horde for no reason - a central (literally) base for people to capture.
---
This may be trivial to most, but I was chasing the fishing extravaganza in STV so this was important to me - Horde have a Horde only quest that gives you the second best fishing pole in the game (with +35 fishing) that Alliance don’t have an equivalent to. By contrast, the BEST fishing pole (which you get by winning the extravaganza) is +40 fishing.
---
Horde have the lowest level dungeon in the game IN THEIR MAIN CITY! They may as well give Horde a quest that gives them a free level from 10 to 11.
---
Anyway - I resent the Horde
---
Why do other healers feel entitled to my Innervate? 
---
I spec deep resto and heal with the best... that mana is mine!
---
Yes it's not that big a deal. It's very nice to have dwarf priests and it could make or break joining a guild, but it's still not awful to go human.
---
I mean...what job cares what you use your own vacation time for? Legally it is none of their business. They either approve it or don’t, doesn’t matter what it’s for.

Although really, you never opt out of Gutterspeak. Except when in Orgrimmar. Why would you.
---
No reply? Now who is the dense?

I'd suggest sorting by release date, and going through the dates. I recall struggling upon this one several moonths ago.
---
Though, you'll need WindowBlinds for the windows, and IconPackager for the icons. While IconPackager is not that bad, WindowBlinds is the infafmous thing that makes Windows unstable.
---
Well, you said they had none.  I proved you wrong.  I also said frost shock would prevent kiting in combination with the other abilities.
---
I have proven my case.  You have done nothing but be rude.  Prove your case or fuck off.
---
Alliance premades beat horde premades.
---
Horde pugs beat alliance pugs.
---
Looks nice mate, best of luck with it.
---
Did your gm babysit handicap people for a living....?
---
Looks good! Thank you for your work!
---
No go straight arms, it's great for dungeons, probably better than prot at most parts.
---
I don't think that's correct. I've just did a ctrl+F on the patch notes for all the TBC patches and found no reference to increased reputation gain.
---
Originally a diehard horde loyalist, I had a few friends and also my brother steadfastly decide they were going alliance. Once I got through my five stages of grief, I stepped back and thought about it a bit more and now I’m actually excited about the prospect. The completionist in me will get to say “I’ve now done the 1-60 journey on both sides of the conflict” and the theorycrafter/competitor in me will get to enjoy navigating an entirely new leveling pathway rather than just following Joana’s Horde Leveling Guide for the n’th time. We already know that Classic won’t be a completely fresh experience as it was when the game came out back in 2004, but at least by switching sides it will move the needle back in that direction and help to recapture that initial wonder. It’s going to be a good thing.
---
Yes 😂😂😂
---
Never under estimate mana regen,  more spirit= more mana regen = more healing = more of the raid not being dead.  
---
What does fear ward give you? oh someone didnt run around daft for 4 sec the horde managed for years, let your MT stance dance he'll be happy for the chance to be crushed and get rage =)
---
&gt; then blame the hunter
---
Us tanks and healers gotta stick together
---
&gt; We don't need more than that. Multiple RpPvP realms will fragment the RpPvP community.
---
I partially disagree here, as I'd like there to eventually be a second such realm in each region so I can play both factions. At first, however, I'm content to settle for one just so we have the chance to show Blizzard there's a real demand for RPvP right out the gate.
---
I thought these didn't stack?
---
just play the regular wc3. reforged is changed to match current wow, not classic.
---
Um they used to have 3 data centers, East, West and Central US.  Are you sure this is not the case still?
---
Isn't this the core part of the issue? Split communities (RP-PVE RP-PVP) amongst to many server types leading to decaying server populations and a sub par experience? I doubt blizzard WANTS to avoid RP servers, they want to avoid low pop servers that eventually fail. 
---
My friend brought up a great point that RP server communities are probably going to be more mature and community oriented, but I don't want to roll the dice on a server that might not be full. I also don't want to ruin some RP'ers day by yelling top kek. 
---
Evocation works by activating your mana regen as if you weren't casting, and then for the next 4 mana ticks, you gain 1500% the normal mana regen. This means spirit massively influence how much mana you generate from evocation. 
---
I strongly disagree with the weakness to Hunters and Warriors. Hunters can't touch you if you stay in Bear Form and kill their pet first. (Hibernate/Roots on pet + kill Hunter works too as long as you know that they are not BM.) And Warriors are the easiest matchup for Druids - as long as you fight them outdoors.
---
I agree that Warlocks are a tough matchup 1v1. Druids probably won't beat Warlocks in a duel if the Warlock does everything right (stays on his mount until the Druid opens, etc). But Warlocks are a non-issue in group PvP for a Feral Druid. A set of HoTs on your teammate will completely negate their DoTs. It's also very easy for you to burst down their pet and then destroy them since the Druid trinket breaks Fear.
---
Assuming that  /sit won't work in Classic,   [https://gyazo.com/edbf2ea095ec6e38f26fc7c0ec8f763a](https://gyazo.com/edbf2ea095ec6e38f26fc7c0ec8f763a) do this and when you get to fury go &gt; 5/5 cruelty, 5/5 booming voice, 1/1 Piercing Howl, 3/3 Blood Craze, 1/5 Improved Battle Shout and  5/5 enrage.  
---
This is excellent for ganking while leveling and also tanking dungeons. 
---
"show target of target" already does this so.........
---
Git gud?
---
Everything about this post is hilarious
---
No, we don't have to go down some endless trail of changes. There are a few sore spots in vanilla (that were fixed at various times). Paladins sucking as tanks is one of them. Changing that doesn't mean you change everything else. 
---
Plus, retail didn't get to be where it is by making subpar specs decent. It got here by alleviating certain problems that created other problems to the point where the basic core values of the game aren't even the same.
---
The idea that you must keep eeevvvveerrrryyyyyttthhhiiiinnnngggg identical and can fix nothing (in an MMO of all things) is ridiculous. Some things back in vanilla were imbalanced in a way that make certain specs rather pointless and we have a huge consensus about it (meaning that everyone who played a paladin and the game designers of the time all agree that Paladin tanks were underwhelming and/or broken).
---
Retail is nothing like vanilla, and fixing paladin tanks wouldn't suddenly change the entirety of vanilla into retail. I hope that some broken things get fixed so we have some of the intended options and can enjoy the game that way. Otherwise, who is going to get excited and roll a prot pally knowing that its second string and largely inferior to prot warrior?
---
There's an engi trinket which transforms the player into a goblin and dismounts the player, really nice for catching people in pvp. 
---
Human Priests are quit good because of the 5% spirit buff racial. Back in Vanilla my guild had a priest called 'Manahotep" because unlike other priests, he pretty much never ran out of mana and as a result topped HPS every time.
---
[Monkeynews on server cap.](https://clips.twitch.tv/PrettyColorfulWatermelonDansGame)

People wanting 2-3k servers are delusional. You need fewer servers with larger population caps to ensure a healthy server.

---
I did the first time, wanted to play undead. Going to have to roll an alliance again though, love those dwarfs damnit! 
---
I should probably do a writeup for the next LFG Monday, but &lt;Axem Rangers&gt; will have a semi-hardcore raiding core with PVP, and raid at 5/6pm CST - 9/10pm CST more than likely. (Our raid times arent in stone yet, but we raid after school days as some officers are school teachers.

---
For the price, no. 
---
They are decent chairs though. But you can get a normal office chair that works just as well for half the price. 
---
Duo is more fun by a long shot though ;D
---
You can and should play what you want. Just keep in mind alliance side (no tremor) you will want 2, 3 to be super safe of your priests with fear ward for tier 1 and 2 content. Later on you should just need 1 or 2, but keep this in mind when competing for a priest slot (guilds usually have 3-5 hpriests)
---
HORDE has tremor totem...
---
I laugh my ass off when people bubble hearth me. This ain't no retail 10-15 minute hearth cooldown.....
---
Ummm... no
---
It's my understanding that they do. I think they total an 8% (or maybe 9%) increase. Riding Crop in BC was created to be a one-item replacement for this combo, IIRC.
---
Almost makes me wish I had a Twitter account so I could add my voice to the chorus.
---
The problem with his reasoning is the '04 launch eschewing RPvP was precisely what kneecapped its popularity and led to the perception of it being such a niche community in the first place. By the time 1.8 rolled around the game had been out for nearly a year, and everyone who might have been interested in rolling RPvP had already established themselves and made connections on other servers.
---
The only way to accurately gauge the interest in RPvP and give us a chance to prove the demand for it is to make it an option *at launch.* Otherwise they'll simply be repeating the selfsame mistake and ensuring the same outcome as happened the first time.
---
I always found it odd the mana sting broke cc.
---
This comes in handy in AV when everybody's chasing the black lotus.
---
Why did you enjoy vanilla WoW? Was it because of the EXACT specifications of the game (which.... changed over the course of vanilla) or perhaps was it the overall gameplay/theme/pacing that it had? Does changing certain broken aspects alter that? Would paladins being good tanks somehow destroy the social atmosphere that the game has?
---
I played a pally all the way up to 60 back in the day and if someone told me that prot would never be viable I would've skipped over it for warrior. By saying nothing can change about vanilla you're basically saying that prot is a niche spec, subpar to warrior tanking. 
---
What is the sense is that? As a game designer, why would you have a spec be broken (either OP or underpowered) and just..... never plan on fixing it? Because your fans believe you can't handle running your own game?
---
We don't need to drastically alter the game in order to fix a few sore spots. Paladins being shit tanks isn't "part of the experience", its just poor design that was fixed. 
---
aegwynspy
---
You miss the most important part, being able to attack any opposing faction member you find in your way. Nice troll post though.
---
I guess. But even the best of the best make mistakes, and that has some people go OFF. And my OP was about guilds that somehow perform worse than most pugs and think they’re good try to find fault in the “outsiders” as to preserve their own ego. But fuck that, people should man the fuck up and learn some tolerance, getting triggered like that is embarrassing. 
---
My friends want to play horde, but I've wanted to use the classic experience as a fresh restart for my old vanilla character.  Due to poor internet at launch, college at classic's peak, and poor internet again while home I never got to take my old warrior as far as I wanted into end game.
---
That being said, things are different now.  I work the evening shift as a manager and all my old friends have day jobs, so we won't get to play together realistically anyway.  In light of that alone I'll be rolling alliance again.  Likely on a different server.  I'll have a horde character on their server for when we can play together, but I plan on spending most of my time solo.
---
I won against every game there was on the server and he was the only one being better than me. Mages had no chance against a good rogue in vanilla. 
---
Not sure how much standing around you do at a raid because spirit regen in raids is pretty rare. 
---
Desperate prayer is the racial you really want. Humans and dwarves both have it.
---
Female dwarf has the greatest casting animations in game though. For me that is the deciding factor.
---
Something kinda like this: [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxRscrzxVxfoLo](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxRscrzxVxfoLo)
---
I put that together quickly, and there are quite a few changes you can make. The only requirement to be considered a 30/21 spec is that you have Heart of the Wild and Nature's Swiftness. The other points can get moved around depending on whether you want to lean towards bear or cat.  
---
I found it super fun, good for many situations, easy to play, etc. But it isn't truly great at anything except not dying. You miss out on a lot of DPS compared to an OoC/Feral spec and you miss key healing talents too. Great all around spec.
---
Good luck using a 20 yard spell to stop mages and hunters kiting you from 30+ yards.
---
&gt; You have done nothing but be rude.
---
And you have done nothing but be willfully ignorant. I have no reason to be nice to someone that's as intellectually dishonest as you. You're in for a rude awakening if you think enhancement is good for anything other than 1-shot montages.
---
Wow TIL. I played a rogue in vanilla but I was just a kid, don't think I ever tried that. I don't mind it being in though
---
Agreed.
---
Do you also attack members of the Argent Dawn, or the Cenarion Circle, when they are of a opposing faction's race?
---
Fortunately, I don't have any wow playing friends. So I get to play the superior orc race without hearing any bitching from the elf loving crowd. Zug Zug.
---
Oh absolutely!

And rep, which is nice.
---
Forgot an ''EZ'' somewhere
---
They really shine in battlegrounds because of their durability and versatility. Also 1 vs 1 they are very competent. I played a feral druid in vanilla and really loved pvping with it.
---
They do. Run speed enchants do no.
---
You have to be very careful with it.  If the pet regen's health or mana, it will agro the other mobs.
---
Server choice was one of my main unchosen decisions about classic (that, and faction) but if there is no RPPVP then I guess I'm forced to just play on normal PvP
---
It sure wasn’t the human racial that attributed to this, it was smart playing and decent gear. 
---
5% spirit is negligible. Heck, you get 10% from Kings. 
---
Just skip it and level at 60
---
I'm rolling a warrior on a PvP server. Orc warrior = spitting on rogue corpses all the way through STV. You couldn't pay me to play anything but orc.
---
Not true. Duo leveling with a class that works to your advantage will always be better in the long run. The first 10-20 levels soloing is faster as you have no AE or chainpulling synergy.
---
I mean they are but they're a cheap gaming chair....you can feel the quality of the materials after a good 6-8 hr session. 
---
Orc for life, Zug Zug.
---
I hated it. To me it was just 2000 with an ugly skin slapped on top. 
---
However for many people it was their first NT-based Windows and I can totally understand that it felt like huge step forward from 9x. 
---
Private server reputation values are wrong (give too much), so take that into consideration when taking the advice of this community.  
---
I played on a private server that gave the wrong rep (too much) and specifically leveled with the intention of doing all Orgrimmar quests. I barely hit exalted.  
---
HOWEVER: Spillover reputation was NOT active on the private server I played.  
---
With spillover reputation added to the calculation, it may very well be possible to hit exalted with Orgrimmar.  
---
I can tell you that pretty much nobody is going to have an answer on this with any proof. None of the database websites back then listed the amount of reputation gained per quest.  
---
I don't even have concrete proof that the values are wrong. I am using a mixture of my own memory (I did the Thunder Bluff exalted grind in vanilla) and a single quote from during that time (possibly before spillover rep was active)  
---
My only advice for you is to make a guided route and do every Orgrimmar quest you can, and any quest you can for spillover during gaps between Orgrimmar reps. Any grinded exp that is not achieved in pursuit of a quest is essentially a waste of potential reputation.  
---
that's not scott tenorman must die
---
In all sincerity is this really the only conclusion you can derive from my comment? That I must be some internet troll/boogey man? 100% not being facetious, I just..... truly do not understand where you got all of that from my post.
---
yeah blizzard launcher is the only place to legally get it. 
---

---
But I don't think you can buy them anymore since reforged was announced. However, if you get reforged it grants you access to old school wc3+frozen throne. "Instant access to classic Warcraft® III (Reign of Chaos® and The Frozen Throne®)"
---
Ishnu'alah weary traveler ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Well shit, if you insist
---
It will slow you down *significantly.* It would technically help you level but the time sink isn't worth it. 
---
I'm in the exact situation. The thing that sucks is I know I will be the first to 60, the last one still playing, and overall the one who puts the time in. But I can't just abandon all of my friends because they picked the wrong faction.
---
Hahahahaha, listen guy....I have proven myself correct. If you dont have EVIDENCE don't bother responding.  
---
Bye, Felicia!
---
Cooking can be a great help while leveling. And can save you time killing grays later on. 
---
Fishing on the other hand, that can wait. 
---
Yes, human priests are good.
---
Racial bonuses are basically only for people who want to push for server firsts and I wouldn't really worry about it otherwise.
---
Every time I have done this, my friends end up quitting &amp; then I end up starting all over with what I wanted to do in the first place.
---
The Horde backdoor jump honestly makes things pretty even. That should (and hopefully will) stay in the game for Classic.
---
Without backdoor jump it’s definitely imbalanced
---
bubble hearth is a stupid meme
---
Most often you will use bubble for stopping fall damage from a quick escape, then you mount or hearth from there.
---
Unenforceable, yeah, but relatively easy to ensure. Just invite nothing but non-officers from more casual guilds. My experience is even when you ask them to read up on the fight they don't do it.
---
Sucks for pvp though at 160 when you are used to playing on 15ms
---
Seriously just fuck the Alliance. I have no respect for alliance players nor the people who feel any sort of allegiance to playing alliance. Nobody has respect for alliance.
---
No because my friends don't suck 
---
Why is the buffing tree talking about deserving things?
---
In the vanilla timeline, the factions are not at war with eachother.
---
Same here. We don’t RP but love the livelihood/organized world pvp of rp-pvp servers, they are just more dynamic. 
---
Saying that enabling /pvp while playing on a pve server is the exact same thing as playing on a pvp server is disingenuous and quite frankly, very stupid. Like, it's so stupid that it's not even worth the time to explain why it's so stupid. 
---
I like this optimistic approach
---
I mean, I made a generic internet joke and you got pretty triggered. Are you sure that the other people are the problem or could it be that maybe you have a short fuse?
---
The only hope you have against a warlock as a mage is to stay up in his face and use instant casts. You're going to get roughed either way it's such a hard counter.  
---
You're going to use all your cooldowns just to kill him. 
---
I too prefer that kind of RP myself.
---
Apologies, I thought you did not understood his point.
---
No tree-form in classic!
---
Hunter pets too
---
Skip fishing and just hold on to the meats you collect from killing quest mobs to level cooking (assuming you are questing).
---
This is on point. Subpar heals, battle rez, and innervate, ~~melee dps, ranged dps.~~ Pretty versatile if you ask me.
---
I was originally a Mage main.  Then Hunter in TBC.  I haven't fully decided yet, but mage is still on my list.  It's just so imba in classic.  Ports and farming ez mode.
---
I've probably made far too many comments already in the other RPvP thread posted... last week?
---
At any rate, in the interest of brevity:
---
AND MY AXE!
---
Also doesn't your natural regen only kick in when you stop casting for 5seconds?
---
Where can I buy that hat
---
Maul doesn't have a cooldown in the guide, what are you talking about?
---
Correct. Which is super rare in a raid unless you’re standing around watching. 
---
You know there are talents which enable spirit regen even during casting right?
---
This is what I'm going to look for when I play classic, never raided and I know very little of raiding in wow. Hopefully I'll find a guild where its kinda not so serious where people try a little bit of what they want because thats what I'm probably going to do.
---
Lmao you're complaining about not having victory rush on quite literally the most overpowered class in the game.  
---
Sure they're crap 1v1, but they're the only hybrid class who heavily excels in all three of it's available theatres of combat.  
---
Nevermind you asking for changes to vanilla.  
---
&lt;Blood Moon&gt; [Alliance-PvP] EU-EN
---
is now recruiting!
---
We're in the (very) early stage of forming a semi hardcore, or to be more specific, a EXPERIENCED CASUAL guild.
---
By "experienced casual" we mean that we do not actively encourage min maxing but we do want our members to be familiar with classic wow (or private servers). 
---
We don't want to rush to endgame, instead we will take our time to smell the roses (again), do quests and dungeons together (we accept memespecs, too :P ), some wpvp, etc.
---
Our goal is to be a big guild with a friendly environment and an active, mature playerbase that keeps the guild chat/discord alive at all times and members who will not hesitate to help their brethrens in need even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange
---
we WILL raid at some point, although we do not have specific plans for endgame yet
---
feel free to join the discord so we can get to know each other until classic launch!
---
https://discord.gg/ZSsSz7E
---
But what about the sea lion dance?!
---
We had class channels for loot discussions.  We had a DKP system with bidding, but most of the classes worked it out ahead of time to be more "fair" with the loot distro.
---
Meh, tier 1 is close enough
---
Fair Enough. But 5% does add up at high levels.
---
Setup Real Life Ah for goods and services.
---
1 Large Pizza Hut Pizza, 2 toppings: 4g delivered within 6 hours.
---
Yep
---
It gets you all the challenging parts of playing on a PvP server.
---
Half the fun of priest healing is playing with the FSR.  Spirit regen is great.
---
Can i and my few million buddies "mention" some things from bc as well? Or maybe WotlK? Boy, i would love me some bladestorm or shockwave. I mean i get PTSD from remembering the amounts of time i have to spam tab and sunder armor.
---
Either a troll or didn't put a single thought.
---
&gt; I actually didn't even expect them not to, until they came out saying they weren't sure if they would.
---
I think most folks felt this way. I know, for my part, it was always my intention from the moment Classic was announced to roll RPvP, and it never even occurred to me that wouldn't be an option.
---
I think most of us were in the same boat, which is, I think, precisely why Ion saying they weren't planning on it caused such an outcry in response.
---
Man I always felt so bad for warriors when I jumped their charge.
---
nah meditation was a myth, no priest ever took them and MP5/incasting mana regen was never considered the most valuable stat.
---
I never played a mage or lock in Vanilla, and only played a hunter to about 25 so I can speak on the comparison too much. However I have years of experience playing Feral in PvP and I can say it is definitely easy to see large disparities in skill between novice and veteran Ferals. I remember seeing plenty of Ferals that would refuse to shift out of cat.
---
Best way to describe it is that you are playing  a way weaker rogue, warrior, mage and priest all in one class. If you stay in one form for any extended period of time it is likely you are playing Feral incorrectly. The rewarding part of Feral is the toolkit; and you're going to need every part of it to be successful against decent players.
---
Other classes focus on one playstyle and they zone in on a particular skillset like a Hunter's ability to play in their range while kiting and not allowing too much time in their deadzone. Feral ties multiple playstyles into one class and binds it all together with superior mobility; overall there's just a lot to learn and improve on.
---
That is another reason why I think Classic Feral is so unique compared to retail because in retail you spend 85% of your combat time in cat, shift to bear to absorb a small window of burst and maybe out to cast a quick non-instant heal. In Classic you spend much more time shifting between all your forms.  
---
Lol jeez it’s a game buddy let’s take it down a notch 
---
As a human you have 15% with Kings. Team People
---
Might be how the guy never ran out of mana? XD
---
Yes. A whopping 15% :/
---
So the effects of an extra 5% are essentially less than 1%. 
---
You get 30% regen inside the FSR due to talents and part of priest healing is trying to get outside the FSR as often as possible.
---
Those are the two classes I played most in Vanilla, and the two I'll probably be playing again in Classic. They're both fantastic for your playstyle.
---
It's worth noting that druids are at least as much of a "leveling powerhouse" as warlocks are. Primarily that's because you use different resources for damage and healing; kill in cat until your health gets low, stand up and drop a heal or two from your full mana bar, then back into form and killing with no downtime. Warlocks are close, but sometimes you're still bottlenecked on things like voidwalker mana.
---
But in addition to that druids' movement speed advantages during leveling are huge. 15% faster at 20, 30% faster at 21, and 40% faster at 30, ages before anyone gets a mount. Remember just how much of Vanilla is spent running from one place to another, then think about cutting off 40% of that time.
---
Yeah I’ve thought about that too. But he seems pretty passionate about staying the course so I’m gonna give it a go. 
---
Yea, we will get to see who really played in classic when the tanks take off their pants or chest while tanking.
---
The answer is complicated. Reputation values seem to vary based upon various patches and expansions and is emulated in different ways depending upon which private server players are using as their current frame of reference.
---
Personally, I think the key to getting exalted will be taking advantage of how Classic will be implementing spillover reputation. Instead of just doing all of the orc quests, you should be able to complete undead (and other Horde city faction quests) all at the appropriate level at the same time to maximize your spillover orc rep from the non-orc quests.
---
The 2500 cap was a server stability issue and was increased later
---
And yet they were pretty popular until they became filled with non-RPers who started ganking everyone. Defias Brotherhood was pretty big, for example, until they mostly migrated to Argent Dawn (normal RP server).
---
Haha if he’s topping the healing meters he’s probably on the ball more than not. Or good at not overhealing. 
---
But not the racial hah. 
---
&gt; I'm afraid that it'll be much harder to find a raid spot as a horde lock. 
---
Don't be. 40 mans, plenty of room.
---
&gt; Does anyone know the demand of locks in a raid on the horde side? 
---
At least 2-3 per raid I'd guess. Healthstones and Soulstones can lead to a new raid group getting their firsts, and summons are a massive boon. Be prepared to farm shards and head out 10-20 minutes before anyone else so you can start summons. 
---
&gt; Also what role do shamans play in 5 mans while leveling? 
---
Any. They can even tank, but it's very niche and your whole group has to know what they are doing. You can heal in pretty much any spec lower levels. If you want to really focus on healing the spec won't really matter until you start Tier 0 dungeons (Strat/Scholo/BRS/maybe BRD as well).
---
I do this, I set A and D to strafe instead of the turn options.
---
Yeah, that is a downside. I do prefer it to noggenfogger though, because it has 100% chance. 
---
Hard disagree on the hunter vs druid matchup. The only druids that are a pain are the balance druids. Ferals that camp in Bear Form are a piece of cake. Scare Beast--&gt;they either eat the fear and get CC'd for a while or they swap out of Bear and become 1 feign/trap/aimed shot combo away from death.
---
Killing the pet first only works if the hunter just sits there without calling his pet back, though admittedly there are a lot of huntards that would do that.
---
Smart druids can't lose a hunter matchup because they can just CC the pet and then outrun the hunter. They're not winning but not losing either.

^this
---
From what I can tell about Shaman; During 5 man content you will join most groups as a healer, though dps isn't unheard of. Most Shaman will level as dps but have a separate set of healing gear to join in dungeons. As for locks in raid scenes I know they can be a popular class at times but don't really know too much about them in the raiding scene.
---
Ahhh didn't know about that, never mained a priest. 30% of 5% isn't huge. mp5 was the big stat back then wasnt it? That stuff worked regardless? I might be wrong though, like i said, never mained priest.
---
What would you recommend?
---
I’m trying to reread my comment searching for anything that may have had me come off as triggered. I can’t, but it can be hard to read the ‘tone’ in text, so I can’t blame you. I’m calmly explaining that these people are an insufferable existence in games. I understand that nerd rage won’t change, but at least can it in front of your whole guild instead of appearing as an asshole. 
---
The last part I’ll gladly echo: expand on your tolerance and empathy - it’s something I try to as well. Games and sports really have our primal side come to show if we let it. 
---
Tibia?
---
Right right. Agian I understand the need for dedicated RP or RP-PVP servers, I'm wondering what the hang up on Blizzards end is, like theres nothing special they have to implement right?
---
Mine either ! :D
---
No problem! To answer your question: not really. If you're questing with him 100% or grinding with him 100%, then it definitely would help take some of the string out of warrior leveling. But a couple of days won't be nearly enough time to get to 60 though, so unless you guys are dedicated to only playing when you're both available to, the chances of you guys of eventually leveling independently is pretty high. 
---
Btw, if you were considering dungeon grinding, it doesn't really offer good exp unless you have a full dedicated group of like-minded players who are wanting to grind through them repeatedly for exp. There's too much downtime when looking to replace players who leave. 
---
Leveling solo as a warrior isn't crazy difficult, it's just more difficult and more time consuming compared to other classes. You'll be eating and bandaging a lot and will have to be careful about taking on more than one mob at a time.
---
Warriors are definitely one of the strongest classes in the game once they get geared, but most people usually underestimate the time investment required to get to that level. It's the slow leveling grind, followed by the pre-raid gear grind where you're competing with all other melees for many pieces, or dumping tons of money and time into getting a good blue weapon, followed by consistently raiding and competing with other melee in a 40 man raid for raid gear for a very long time. It's a big investment, that's totally worth it, but not realistic for everybody. Hunters are the inverse, where you're not required to spend huge amounts of time to see big gains, and are very self-reliant, so I think it will fit your expectations more. The trade off is Hunter's power cap over time is lower.
---
Worst part about being a lock is being summoning bitch. People will be goofing around on their alt then log on 5 seconds before raid start time and expect a summon. 
---
Shaman raiding is easy. Just play whack a mole on health bars with chain heal. 
---
And WotF
---
Yeah I figure I’ll be keeping an alliance alt so I can still get my alliance fill. Plus I see myself playing for a long tike anyways so I’m sure eventually I’ll have 60s on both sides. 
---
Didn't vanilla have infinite push back?
---
Good thought, I didn't think of that. But I'm convinced to many Rp/RpPvP servers at launch would hurt the Rp community. 1 or 2 max on launch, that's it.
---

"Bored anti-Classic, BfA player resorting to burger flipping -- WTS burgers in order to buy cash shop unicorn mount number 857."
---
As a druid tank I hated getting called welfare tank. Yes I used S2/S3 gear but that’s because in TBC resilience was better then any normal tank gear for a bear (not to mention the only set with +defence was nerfed and blue).  I just needed enough resilience to become crit immune.  And pvp epics was both hp and resilience.   
---
LFG killed the community.  No longer was my skill as a tank or healer (reputation) worth anything. I just queued up and did my job needing what ever I could use.  As realms was connected being an as hole didn’t affect me.  (Not that i did that but the mentality changed).  
---
I did like TBC more then vanilla tho since then all specs became valid.  I liked that.  (Druid was op as fu at start to ;)
---
There are is no issue making a server and the correct options, that's pretty basic. The problem is Blizzard didn't think there was a big enough demand for even a single server, which is far far from the truth. 
---
Booooo
---
That real life Orgrimmar pic lmao
---
Oh I would too but just like interactive in game GMs thats never going to come back because it costs Blizzard resources. They have the capital for it of course but I doubt their Board Members would give the green light to hire more people to service tickets and monitor inappropriate names when they just laid off so many CMs.               
---
                
---
It would be like them turning around tomorrow and announcing HotS tournaments are going to be a huge thing after they just shut all that down.
---
If you want a conc 4k players, you keed a population of around 40k active players on average.
---
At launch the total number will naturally be lower as the total playerbase is more active
---
I see this maturity argument being thrown around and I have **nothing against** RP-PvP servers but just curious why do you believe RP-PvP would be more mature? In retail Venture Co. RP-PvP (EU) generally was considered to be a **mental asylum of WoW**. You could literally find a half son of Arthas making love to a bear druid in a bush. There were all sorts of troll rp profiles and ERPing all around where in Argent Dawn (EU) those were focused into **Goldshire**. 
---
I visited there after reading about it in a WoW magazine article to see if it really was that crazy and boy.. it was..
---
Also from roleplaying point of view RP'ing on a pvp server is pretty hard because you can get ganked and in vanilla **roleplayers generally wear gear that looks good, not gear that has stats so for ganking hungry players they are the perfect prey**. Maybe that is the reason why normal RP servers were more popular for actual RP and RP-PvP was a crazyy place. Who knows.
---
Anyways I believe that more options for players of all kinds is good so **I'm all for RP-PvP servers** and there clearly IS demand **so bring it on Blizz**!
---
I would if they were compenting with me for spawns.
---
Seconding hunter priest.  Very strong.  Have leveled this comp with friend.

---
Probably a bit more.
---
Hunters have a few tricks they need to master: jump shot kiting, feign death/trap. Mages and warlocks should probably get good at juking interrupts. But once you have those skills down, you're good.
---
The defining trait of a good druid is knowing the toolkits of all your forms, and switching constantly between them. So it's not only a bit more to learn beforehand, but a bit more ongoing skill to use.
---
Not to mention stormpike leggings from Flag running.  I used those all the way to lv 68.  After tbc launched.  
---
They fucked blink up in one of the expansions though.
---
I have this problem, but it's that Horde is home for me and my friend really wants to play a paladin. Sigh :(
---
I'd go for shaman and don't sweat the consequences.
---
This is what I was thinking, I remember reading that they were changing some of the story/lore of WCIII to match today’s lore, so reforged actually wouldn’t segue into classic, only OG WCIII would.
---
could be wanding. I don't believe that triggers the 5 second rule.
---
Uhm so, when you say things like "these people are an insufferable existence" it comes across that you are very VERY bitter. At minimum bitter, since you stated you aren't angry I'll take your word for it. But you do seem rather bitter, and me saying "git gud" prompted a lot of bitterness and salt to flow from you. Even if it was flowing calmly, it still appeared that you were very distraught towards these people. Which I do agree there are shitters (thats what my group calls them) where they pull down the group and blame other people instead of the people actually at fault. I often get kicked from groups for shittalking people that do that because I know its not my numbers or mechanics thats causing the wipe. Its the warrior doing half my dps, standing in fire, then floor tanking the rest of the fight.
---
No it was not. Watch [ClassiCast #13](https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=2394) at the 39 minute mark.
---
People need to stop spreading this lie about it being a technical limitation.
---
You have to drop form to avoid the Scare Beast. The Hunter is doing 0 damage while he casts. Shifting out to dodge the Fear (and eating 1 attack from the pet out of Bear Form) is less damage than the Hunter just attacking you and not trying to fear you.
---
every private server? lol
---
Oh I remembered my first try in Gruuls lair.  
---
Shit we got our asses spanked and we had to cleared Kara a few times first to make it 
---
25M - UK looking for EU - PVP - Alliance - Raiding guild -  2-3 nights per week ideally 
---
I'll be playing human prot warrior and aiming to hit 60 and have pre raid BIS in the first 2-4 weeks. Will be taking engineering as a profession, unsure about what to pair it with for now. I'll also be looking to level alts for split runs, gold farming etc.
---
I've hit 60 before and tanked end game dungeons but haven't raided in classic yet, it would be good to work alongside a more experienced tank while I get a feel for it.
---
I'm keen to find a guild that will hit the ground running at release and hopefully take advantage of being in the first wave of capped characters. I'm graduating  in June and hoping to get most of the leg work done over the summer before I have to find a job haha.  Would also be good to get a plan in the works before release and have played a bit together to see how we all click. If you think your guild might be a good match please get in touch :)  Nukked94#6037 on discord 
---
Getting ahead was always a non-factor back in classic even when new full servers were released. It would barely be a problem even for the first hour of play. 
---
If sharding is implemented it is going to be an absolute non-issue. 
---
Whoever hits 60 first will definitely be whoever is best at no-lifing WoW for one week. Sleep will factor very heavily. 
---
God no! If they released it before Classic then it’ll still likely be unfinished and buggy as hell. It’ll probably have enough problems when it is released. I don’t want another Blizzard rush job.
---
Good hunters will spam Scare beast or trap you. Their pets are also highly resistant to CCs depending on spec. Warriors are not easy by any means, one mistake can cost you. I reiterate what I said about player skill being the primary factor, but to ignore the burst potential of warriors or the toolkit that hunters have to combat druids is silly. All it takes for a warrior to kill you is a trinket into intercept while you think you're safe and they will 100-0 you. Once again this is all hypothetical but it CAN happen. 
---
Druid is fine. Mark/thorns are solid buffs, faerie fire is a great pulling skill, can throw out plenty of heals between sets of kills and lotp is a nice little bonus at 40. I don’t see how a priest would be considered stronger duoing with warrior.
---
NaM ?
---
Fishing and cooking were my two favorite things in vanilla!  If we're on the same server feel free to join me and my friend fishing for some stonescale eels!
---
This was my guilds experience as well. On our first big kills we'd flask like our first nef kill twin emps  our MT's had titans for naxx fights. We ended up clearing everything in aq40 except c'thun and got 5 bosses in naxx. By no means were we a great guild, but we were ahead of a lot of people. We didn't stack world buffs or use every consumable it just wasn't really done like that in vanilla outside of world first guilds. And the content is definitely not tuned around having all those extra buffs. In no universe did blizzard devs see a 30 minute raid. It was meant to be time consuming to keep you paying your sub and occupying your time.
---
I see...
---
Thhe thing is I've never seen a normal office chair have these "pillow" things where you rest the back and the head. I don't know if it does make a diference tho.
---
My raid back in vanilla cleared all of MC and half of BWL without ever having a dwarf priest.  We only ran human and NE priests.. just because we never really min/maxxed and went looking for specifically a dwarf just a priest in general. 
---
If you look at the fights that have fear though, there aren't a ton of them in raids. Technically human priests have higher HPS and Mana regen than dwarves (albeit by a VERY SLIM margin) so to min max on non fear fights a human would be better (since the talent that your spirit increases your healing done).   But it's so small it doens't really matter.  
---
sure
---
It helps Spiritual Guidance too.

Why do you talk with such confidence?
---
Personally I have no desire to play an rp server and will be rolling regular pvp, but I think it's ridiculous they arent planning on releasing your server type until "maybe later".
---
Thank you.
---
fuck that means i will need to be undead? sign ... goodbye tauren priest boy
---
this post is tough to read
---
No. It was definitely fixed during vanilla. 
---
good, you'll be filling an important niche. I'm just of the opinion that such things should be an out of game option rather than a direct overlay. It kind of flies in the face of what the classic team is even doing, they've said themselves that they're thinking of disavowing certain addons that go against the spirit of classic.
---
I don’t know. Is calling something for what it is salty? I guess that’s your perspective. I was just trying to convey a message. I don’t engage with these people or ‘shittalkers’ like you. I don’t condone that behaviour. It’s juvenile to me, and at most whoever’s being ‘shit talked’ will be having the time of their life because they know they’ve had someone go out of their way to respond to them in a hostile manner. I bet you thought “Goal!” too when you thought your comment had gotten me upset. You call me out for my assumed ‘bitterness’ and are trying to appear on the moral highground, but you attempted to draw me into an argument with said comment. That’s the definition of trolling, mate. 
---
Judging from this post I’m guessing you felt attacked by my comment because you’re one of the ragers I mentioned? =P
---
Hahaha yep me mentioning victory rush, which was objectively a fantastic quality of life change for warriors way back when, is me complaining and asking for changes.
---
What's got you so worked up?
---
It was fixed during vanilla.
---
The funny thing is that the hardcore guilds will have the tanks capable of stance dancing fears anyway.
---
It's the casual guilds that might get screwed without fearward
---
This is so much good information man, thank you so much. You’ve given me a ton to consider.
---
Are you planning on playing Alliance or Horde? If you’re playing Alliance and you wanted to be a Guild Master, I’d join tf out of your guild.
---
For this keep in mind that the difficulty of the quest alters the amount of rep.  so from a yellow quest you will get max rep, if it's green you will get less rep, depending on how much you out level the quest's level.
---
They're 2 completely different games. I'd join a classic only discord as I have no interest in BfA.
---
Okay I will pretend you aren't being obtuse here and ask you to layout your criteria for what makes them a "viable" pvp spec.
---
My only restriction is you list the criteria seperately and in bullet form.
---
example:
---
-has heals
---
-has mana
---
-can ride a flight path
---
if you double up ill contest it until you change it.
---
Part of the problem is when someone says "prove it" what they really mean is "i want to exhaust you by making you go to great lengths to prove something based on MY standards while i get the easy job of nitpicking all the tiny insignificant things on the peripheral." 
---
I'm not accusing you of this but I learned a long time ago online that people do this and you have to be very careful to give in slight incriments or else people take advantage/abuse you.
---
give me the bullet form list making yourself vulnerable to criticism and we will talk more in depth.
---
Such RP, much amaze, wow.
---
Hi, /u/mchairmaster
---
Exactly. So honestly if getting exalted is your only goal, it’s best to abandon Tirisfal altogether and go to the Valley of Trials.
---
thanks, so you recommend going 0/30/21 while leveling?
---
After 14+ years of Horde, I'll be maining Ally for a fresher experience thsi time. But I'll be rolling an Undead SP alt to play with friends. 
---
They could. I did it as my alt.  But for raids. Well don’t expect to replace a warrior before AQ.  You can OT but your going to fight for your slot.  Hard.  
---
&gt; What's got you so worked up?
---
Mostly the comedy that you provide. 
---
I'm not sure I agree with this.  Having Divine Spirit was great!  I always outlasted most of the pure holy priests in my heavy disc spec.  Not to mention I could use power infusion as a way to beef up lower level spells or kick up the offense on someone from time to time!  To each their own though...
---
I put it on down arrow so I have it if I absolutely need it 
---
&gt; Outside of *In Frost We Trust* and k4li's *Art of Grinding* guides, I doubt either of us can think of anyone who actually worked on the routing. ESPECIALLY routing on a fresh server.
---
You're right there, though in my case that's mostly because I couldn't actually namedrop many vanilla speedrunners from back then anyway. And to be fair, speedrunning the game really didn't even exist back then the way it does now. That being said people did consider leveling primarily by AoE grinding, and it just wasn't that good. It's vulnerable to contesting and doesn't get you much in the way of gear unless you stop to do quests every few levels, and the XP/hr just wasn't enough to make up for that.
---
&gt;But now I can think of several who are doing the work on what are the best approximations of Vanilla that we have. These people aren't unintelligent and are aware of the discrepancies that might occur when the real deal arrives.
---
&gt;In the highly documented locations I listed: Spawn tables won't be much different, density is right, mob health won't differ enough to matter, mob armor doesn't matter for mage, and XP yield is verifiable.
---
The problem with even a "best approximation of Vanilla" is that any differences in how fast you kill mobs are highly cumulative. Mobs spawning a little faster, being packed a little denser or being slightly easier to kill will make an enormous difference over the course of leveling. The accuracy of private servers in this regard is simply too poor to make this kind of careful plans on. The only thing I would trust them with regarding speedleveling is with general questing route outlines, and even then you have to keep in mind the margin of error involved with every mob kill you do and quest drop you get.
---
No doubt preparing on private servers is (or can be) better than nothing. However lots of people clearly live under a complete delusion over the accuracy (or lack thereof) of private servers and the effects that has on gameplay. The reality is that everything related to mob spawns is pretty much a guesstimation on private servers, as not enough data on it was gathered when we still had the opportunity to gather that data. Not enough people really cared about truly accurate private servers before Cataclysm, and the few that did had much more important issues to focus on than tweaking mob spawns to be exactly right. Then patch 4.0.1 hit and the opportunity (or what was left of it after all the changes to old world content in WotLK and TBC) to do that was forever lost — until Classic came along, at least.
---
This is a point that I unfortunately will not concede until we can see things for ourselves this summer.
---
You just described a regular RP server though. What makes RPPvP a necessary niche? In my experience the PvP element of those servers has always superseded the RP to the point where RPPvPs basically turn into regular PvP servers after a while. Serious RPers have always gravitated toward PvE since it allows the freedom to role play in the world without fear of ganking trolls. RP PVP is two incompatible play styles in my opinion. 
---
I was thinking of Alanna's Embrace from Ras in Scholomance, but that one will do just fine too.
---
Nope. For the Horde.               
---
          
---
If my friends decide they wana play on a PVP server or fairy ass Alliance they were never my friends to begin with.              
---
             
---
Ok... now I'm only saying this because I HAVE only 1 friend left from my Vanilla days whos also dead set on Horde.
---
Thanks. It's probably Imgur's fault. Found a high-res version here: https://hanacaraka.co/imgs/hd-map-of-the-azeroth-pre-sundering-wow-at-world-warcraft-maps.jpg
---
Did you just make a simming program for Classic?
---
I knew stuff like this would happen.
---
It‘s always the hunter anyway.
---
No problem! Warriors are gear intensive, so be prepared to raid for gear if you want to unleash their full potential. Until AV hits, you'll either need to grab a raid weapon or dump some money into getting an Arcanite Reaper (or Demonshear from Stratholme? Good for Sword spec and/or Humans). Be sure you keep a good stock of free action potions to use when you're afflicted with a non-dispellable slow or if your healer is unavailable to dispel (unless you have a paladin in the group-- Blessing of Freedom is *amazing).* You won't be able to help much in the way of control yourself, but you'll bring the pain (and Mortal Strike's healing reduction debuff), and take a decent beating too. And also be prepared to play with your friends a lot: 1v1 and solo play are your weak sides.
---
Did ZG just now, not sure I wanna spend hours grinding for the Ony part, but I guess it could be fun. 
---
Both are highly desirable. Shamans more so.
---
Scare Beast and trap can both be avoided if the Druid plays well (and Scare Beast means the Hunter is not attacking, which is a net positive for the Druid). And yes Warriors can catch you at a bad time - just like you can Ravage that Mage while he's drinking.
---
But Horde on my server used to do it back in the day. It should stay in. #nochanges
---
it's definitely not, there was a r 14 ret pally on one if the servers I played, he wasn't good but he was account sharing and basically online 24/7
---
lol wut?
---
Haha thanks man! Unfortunately, I'll be rolling Horde, and not a guild master. Like you, I don't have enough time to play to take on that role. I'm hoping to have enough time to raid casually, but not counting on it. I appreciate the compliment though! 
---
I'm going Orc Warlock, so maybe I'll run into you guys in a BG :P
---
Chuck Norris slept with Mankrik's wife. 
---
How did you get to Mulgore!? The game ends when I go through the portal :(  
---
Easy, brewsey, beardiful, Cover Dwarf
---
Nothing. More than likely setting themselves up to be like “look we listen we added it! At a later time” 
---
No they won't. What they will say is that you cannot do any of those things with THEM because that's what they want. Theres room for everyone so do your own thing.
---
How much faster would you say solo is faster for a warrior? And how so? Only down side I see is the 50% mob kill exp but not having to stop as often in between pulls should make up for that, no?
---
Because of the nature of Druids (they have the ability to heal, damage, tank, CC, whatever the situation calls for), you have to know more about the game and you need to have more situational awareness than pretty much any other class. Druids who just heal or just deal damage are trash. That's how the game was designed.
---
Sounds great! Thanks again!
---
It's really hard to go from 295 to 300 weapon skill and any int can really speed things up.
---
Yes, my Orc is highly racist of those dog faced pretend human beings 
---
No one said there weren’t rp servers. You might want to take a shower, put on clean cloths, wash your sheets, get some fresh air and perspective. Your post is pretty concerning and stinks of yogioh.
---
The problem is that "fixing those sore spots" opens up the floodgates for people demanding other class changes.
---
Just stop. Classic is 1.12, not "1.12 with some class changes".
---
PvP actually makes RP a complete pain in the ass. They are two incompatible play styles and that’s why RPvP never works. How are you supposed to role play getting ganked and constantly respawning after death? Makes no sense. It’s a huge hassle and serious RPers prefer PvE because you can RP your stories in peace out in the world without fear of getting trolled. 
---
This is awesome! And if I can add fuel to the flame of motivation, having 3 friends who’ve never played a MMO before, will definitely be giving them this and teaching them to use it at classic launch. 
---
Please keep up the great work 
---
That's the thing though, shifting out of bear to dodge the fear means you are vulnerable to being scattered right there and then, which means they then get trapped and eat an Aimed Shot in caster form. If they don't shift out of bear, they're eating the fear. They can counter that by taunting the pet/skulling in anticipation of the scatter though.
---
I've yet to go against a feral that could beat me, but caster druids that either go full burst spamming moonfires or play it like an SL lock and dot you up--&gt;go in bear form and outlast you are a massive pain. Thankfully they're pretty rare.
---
You want to have a go at the little ones? You're gonna have to go through me, and probably Chris Hansen.

Lol, as I clearly stated I don't rage I just shittalk people that rage at me when their bud is sucking bad. But I can see how insulting a group of people because you believe you are above them in a really condescending way can not be perceived as salty. Though, let me break this down for you. Talking down to someone, regardless of whats happening. Is salty, its conceited, and rude af. Also you are engage "with these people...like you" as you are literally engaging with me right now lol. So you are just awful at following through with your own statements. I never intended for you to get upset, originally I was clearly making a joke and anyone who doesn't get triggered easily would have said "Ikr, i suck mate". Instead you go "Woah man Im really good at this video game, and people that tell me im not are insufferable" and then I go it was a joke, and you go "Wow you are such a shittalker you must be in denial about how good I am and how much of a rager you are"  
---
Like bruh, freaking out and making accusations after constantly insulting people doesnt help prove your point... If anything it makes you look like an asshat who really needs justification they have the moral highground when making reddit comments to shittalk people is the definition of not having the highground lol.
---
This was my assumption too. A tactical approach to make it sound like they are listening to the community (Hell it will work). Not having at least one RP-PVP server just seems like shooting themselves in the foot. 
---
How do you progress through the game when you are hated by all the neutral factions?
---
Their own or i won’t be playing, pretty simple 
---
Absolutely play whatever race you want. Some people are so min/max they prioritize racials over anything, but any priest race is viable. Horde doesn't even have the option for Dwarves, and it's not like they're helpless without them.
---
Roll a Shaman, 2 tap people with your insane spell crits.
---
Probably just join an existing ironman community? They're gonna run a classic version I believe.
---
I'm planning to try this somewhere down the line, but probably years after launch.
---
There is no objective reason for RpPvP servers not to exist at launch. That is why the Classic community is so baffled about this. The only way too explain it is that Ion simply wasn't aware of the demand for RpPvP servers at the time of doing the Q&amp;A. Now that the demand has been shown to clearly exist there is no logical reason to not have them.
---
But not having RpPvP servers at launch is so nonsensical that I kind of start believing in the theory that they are only saying that, so they will look better when they actually announce them. 
---
As far as I'm concerned, RP-PvE servers enable the kind of roleplayers who want to play the game like it's amateur theatre. The kind of roleplayers who just want "organic" roleplay are unaffected by PvP rules. Personally I belong to the latter category, having never been too interested in stiltedly acting out Legolagorn's and Galadgal's virtual wedding.
---
It should go to Priests on progression. They get a lot more mana from it. A full mana bar and then some. Just tell your group that you're taking credit for half of that Priest's healing.
---
If it's an easy fight? I'm taking it. Saves me some money on mana pots.
---
Having them bubble hearth is just as satisfying as getting the kill. I feel like I just sent them packing
---
Well that could be easily exlained by RpPvP servers being heavily disadvantaged by being released only a year into Vanilla. The Rp community had already established itself on the RpPvE servers making it difficult for RpPvP servers to attract a large Rp crowd. The Rpers simply gravitated towards regular Rp because that's where most of the Rp was.
---
Rp and PvP can coexist. There is nobody stoping you from going to the cathedral district and doing rp. You're just more limited when it comes to contested zones due to the possibility of ganking. But that adds a lot of immersion to the world by making it more dangerous, and that's what Rp is all about for me, immersion.
---
My advice is to play what seems most fun unless you're hardcore raiding for progression. You will spend way, way more time just playing your character, levelling, farming, doing 5mans than doing fresh raid content.
---
If I had to pick between the two I'd say shaman because healing is fun and I like playing hipster enhance
---
I was 55 the first time I was liked into MC. I had got the attunement and no one else was on. Some green of the eagle legs dropped and they gave them to me as an upgrade. I just was there to throw curse of elements and give out health stones. My room mates stopped playing and hauled ass to my room to see what was going on
---
Rolling solo as a warrior good luck and godspeed you'll need it, that and a lot of roasted quail.
---
Locka are needed for the early dungeons like MC and BRS for their banish, on top of dps.
---
If 1% haste = 1 dps, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is not accurate.
---
Missing a lot of items, and, uh... windfury

I’d say different problems

I think you can see your membership payment history through the blizzard website somehow. That may be an adequate indicator?
---
/pvp will not enable all the aspects a pvp server has to offer. PvP is still non consensual for the opposite faction which is unimmersive.
---
When classic was revealed, I thought to myself: Wow, a perfect opportunity to experience the horde storyline and finally play that Troll Shaman I always wanted to try out.
---
Then, as time goes by, and I start experimenting with leveling classes on certain servers that shall not be named, I start getting second thoughts. Then, I level a Night Elf Druid, then a Dwarf Priest and a Dwarf Paladin.  
---
Long story short, I have concluded that Alliance is where my heart is. Playing Horde for me is like going for a little vacation on a nice cabin in the mountains; It's nice for a little while, but it's always good to come home again!
---
8 seconds. Felhunters can also counter spell your sheep
---
AV Epics aren't welfare... it takes a lot of games to get exalted and then they cost a lot of gold too. The mount was like 700g so it only saves you 100. 
---
&gt; everything related to mob spawns is pretty much a guesstimation on private servers 
---
What do you think is going to happen? That world first hopeful mage is going to nuke down Bloodfen raptors and a Raptor Wizard is going to spawn we never knew about and screw his pull up? He clears them once and it turns out they have a 10 minute respawn? Maybe the Southsea Pirates in Classic will have 3k HP even though we know they didn't in Vanilla? 
---
What are the **concrete** differences in these highly documented locations between vanilla and private servers that would drastically affect *one player* completely to themselves. I need some facts
---
You might be able to search your email inbox for "world of warcraft verification" to find the date you created the account.

---
It will allow you to look up your character and see exactly when you hit certain levels, and what guilds you joined.  However be warned: I don’t think it logged any character under 30, and it has ads for gold buying sites. 
---
Both Warlocks and Shamans will be in demand for raids, don't worry about that. Really this should boil down to if you want to DPS or heal in a raid. Outside of raids, shamans will usually heal in 5 mans, unless there's already a healer.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is Warlocks have most of their bag space filled up with soul shards, and you will also have to farm a lot of them before each raid. But I as I said above, the main thing that's going to help you make this decision is simply figuring out if you want to DPS or Heal in a raid. 
---
My two closest friends in the world both wanted to play horde in classic. I told them that I wished them the best and I would see them on the battlefield. Last we spoke, they decided to roll alliance with me.
---
Lol if they want to be horde I'm all for it. I only ask for the same sentiment in return, and they better not roll my server: red=ded
---
I don't want to hang out with a bunch of necrophiliacs and furries in mud huts all day long
---
Horde. I love how gnomes die
---
This but ironically
---
Thats EXACTLY my thought proccess but theres still 2 or three front page posts on Please Blizzard give us RP-PVP servers and "Come on guys lets make some noise and let um know were here!" and then when they announce they listened and everyones cheering and clapping each other on the back, giving each other a hand job under the table as if what they did mattered.

if you spec for bear tank, then in 0/30/21 you choose between 2 final points in threat increase/prowl detection and savage fury. on the fence myself
---
I'm not arguing with you.  I agree.
---
What I'm doing is trying to figure out what can be inferred about how they are thinking from the comments they've made.
---
If they're not convinced there's enough demand for both an RP-PvE server and an RP-PvP server, they're sure as Hell not convinced there's demand for RP-PvE servers plural in either North America or Europe.
---
Any heal is better than no heal for a warrior 
---
Weapon DPS means nothing to feral druids in form.
---
Ion says he is concerned about healthy server communities.
---
The irony is that not having an RPPvP server at launch is the single worst thing you can do for the population's health, both for RPPvP and the PvP servers that may see an exodus to the "fresh" server.
---
distracting dagger + distracting dagger sims WAY higher than r14 swords (human)
---
could you explain this to me please? rest of gear is BWL bis
---
Shifting out of form doesn't start the global cooldown. You can shift out then back in instantly. The Hunter would have to cancel his cast and cast Scatter Shot at essentially the same time that the Druid presses his key to shift out. Not reliable - it might happen once, but you won't see that happen twice in a row to the same Druid.
---
Even if it *does* happen: Aimed Shot is not a death sentence. Nature's Swiftness, heal, back into form, and suddenly you just reset the fight. Hunters have no way to burst a Druid outside of that combo so you don't need your NS for anything else.
---
Yea. With 2 jobs and education it would be impossible to ding 60 in first year of classic. I just want after work just sit on my pc and play without worries. Let those kids play with weapons and which faction is the stronger one haha.
---
You know, a lot of these people have already played classic on private servers and progressed through all the raids multiple times, yet still want more and to be able to play on official servers is a big deal.
---
I'd just go with the class fantasy you like best. You don't want to play hundreds of hours to 60 only to end up as a class you're lukewarm about. 
---
You have to save your game before entering the portal, then go through the portal.  After the credits it brings you to the title screen.  Select load game and load your save.  You will be at the Darkmoon faire.
---
Stuff like this already happened 14 years ago
---
It will be fucking huge. The second coming of WoW.
---
It was simply way ahead of its time when it launched and even to this day can offer a gaming experience found nowhere else, not even in retail.
---
No point in arguing about it.
---
This. Check out your payment history on battle.net. It has everything!
---
Where you get "1% haste = 1 dps"? 
---
Also, you should check your "Heroic strike frequency".
---
I suggest you to look deeper first.
---
That's bad?
---
Faction schmaction. Im only choosing horde because i was alliance the 1st time round. I dont feel any loyalties to either i just feel like change
---
I get a mini heart attack hearing the stealth sound in capital cities like "Is this it? Is this how I go out?"
---
Really good points about the movement speed. So much running in vanilla. Getting a free mount at 40 is pretty awesome though. 
---
You'll build a reputation in no time
---
Will you be releasing the github so we can confirm its accurate? It looks cool. I'm wondering how your calculating overpower as well as the swing reset. It seems to greatly favor faster weapons, is it calculating rage gain and capping ability usage or is the heroic strike usage essentially completely up to the user right now?
---
For instance distracting dagger seems to be the best mainhand on the sheet currently, its performing 100 dps higher than Death's sting which seems questionable
---
Your not wrong, but if they don't add RP-PVP servers, a large chunk of the player base are going to be seriously let down.
---
You will have an objectively hard time getting into a raid as a ret paladin compared to an accepted raid spec, that is a fact.
---
You will not be competitive with people who flask if you yourself do not flask, that is also a fact.
---
Not sure what the problem is here
---
I can quite confidently say you are wrong. There were no simming programs/options in classic.
---
If you can provide evidence, feel free to prove my memory wrong.
---
Heroic strike freq is set to 90%?
---
Hard to gank with all the elites walking around 
---
That's the good stuff!  I've done it before, and somebody needs to be available to tank for pugs amirite.
---
... do you know what that phrase means?
---
The full epslisode was on youtube for free it could possibly still be
---
If they genuinely didn't realize the demand for RP-PVP servers, then as a company they must be really detached from the community.
---
huh? Not at all.  
---
If anyone wants to use this, they now have an option and I think that's great!  
---
There's also clearly a lot of work gone into this/going into this and I also think it's impressive, fair play.
---
&gt;  so from a yellow quest you will get max rep, if it's green you will get less rep, depending on how much you out level the quest's level.
---
Incorrect. If it grants full XP (green or higher) it grants full Rep. There is no XP or Rep loss between green and yellow, or higher.
---
XP and Rep are only lost once a quest becomes gray.
---
Oooohhhhhh...
---
Groups? Sure. Raids? meeeh.
---
&gt;reforged is changed to match current wow
---
Oh wow I didn't know that
---
Do you know what the changes are? I haven't played WoW in 8 years and have no idea where the story is at now
---
1. People are going to ask for what they ask for. People are already asking for things, there are no metaphorical "doors", there's just a huge fan base that don't all think the same thing. Our conversation proves that much.
---
2. Why would making paladins decent tanks render warriors pointless to bring to raids? More importantly, why do you randomly lump in some additional consequence with every change? Its possible to make paladins better tanks without making them superior to warriors in every way. Druids are decent tanks, not quite as good as warriors, but they possess utility that warriors don't (like mark of the wild, and a combat rez). 
---
3. Honest question: Does WoW have to be a 100% identical recreation of 1.12 to be what it was? I mean, DURING vanilla wow changed several times but there was no single, perfect mix that made it what it was, right? The game slowly morphed into retail over the years because of key changes (LFD, flying mounts, heirlooms), it was never about a a singular change, and WoW wasn't GOOD because certain specs sucked.
---
You can't push me out of being interested in playing classic with non shitty paladins. I'm not advocating for those huge game defining changes, I don't want (insert expansion pack here), I want to play WoW all its social glory, Vanilla is by far the closest (I had the best time during vanilla), but I don't see why we have to tether ourselves to changing NOTHING. 
---

---
But how many gigabytes is the second coming of wow?
---
Go back to Chapo, cuck
---
They should just release the games when they're ready, no rush and no delays just to time the releases, the only delays I'll accept is if they need more time to ensure their quality.
---
There's a limited number of mobs for you to kill and you will be competing with other people for them.
---
If you have to kill twice as many mobs, that means you'll spend twice as much time waiting for respawns.
---
Quest items can only be looted by one person, so that's twice as many boars you'll have to find.
---
Questing is also much more efficient than grinding mobs, but there aren't that many quests in vanilla, especially time efficient ones. Even as solo you might run out of them from time to time.
---
Since you get less XP from kills, you will either have to go after the more obscure quests or just mindlessly grind mobs for hours at a time. Either option will slow you down.
---
There's a reason why all speed levelers are solo leveling.
---
&gt; I don't see why we have to tether ourselves to changing NOTHING.
---
See:
---
&gt;Classic is being launched as a preservation of 1.12
---
Yep, what he said  and also I think around  70 gigs. 
---
I will cook and Fish in stages. So it will slow ne down a couple of Hours every time for like 4 to 5 times and I’m going to love it!
---
I'll personally wait till 60 and level fishing/cooking side by side. May as well use the worthless fish to level cooking.
---
&gt;I never got into the RTS Warcraft games 
---
Have you tried it and didn't like it or you never played it at all? Because if you simply never tried it I can't recommend it enough. As far as the story is concerned it will def give you flash backs to your adventures in WoW, especially if you play The Frozen Throne expansion (assuming you played during WoTLK)
---
I don't know how that would be possible seeing as the horde mongrels have barely evolved to the use of tools, much less utilizing the scientific method. Hand them some smallpox blankets and the war is over.
---
I haven't read your whole comment, but you seem to be the one who's upset. I didn't mean to offend you. Have a nice weekend. 
---
I'm sorry, is this an online game that people pay money to play, or is it a museum? If i'm going to play the game I have just as much right to ask for anything as you do. I don't try to shoo you away, but I instead consider your comments and side of the point and respond accordingly. 
---
Meanwhile you ignored my entire post just to semantically quote yourself.
---
Honestly, even if you can't argue your point better than that, at least engage in the conversation. Otherwise why even bother replying?
---
It was enabled with 1.12, If it is disabled, that is a change. 
---
Cannot decide between Druid and Shaman.  I like the idea of tanking in bear form, but the more I read the less I feel like random groups will let me.  I am still not sure how many of my friends will be playing.  I also like the idea of shaman, although I would prefer enhancement, which is also something I read is hard to get by after a while....decisions decisions....
---
I’ve never been willing to play a faction or race I don’t want for friends or family. If they wanna be cancer and play Ally, let them. You’ll have to take my Orc Shaman from my cold, dead hands.
---
edit: just to be clear, this only matters if you're really trying to level as fast as possible. If you don't mind adding a couple of extra days to your total /played time, then go with duo, it'll be easier and more fun.
---
Okay but what about prot pally???
---
Because I've had this """debate""" countless times with people like you demanding changes to the game and I'm sick of it.
---
Classic is being launched as 1.12, no class changes. Deal with it.
---
Hey horde scum, your chiropractor called - you missed your last appointment. 
---
I don't use A and D. Those are bound to spells.
---
who switches to gutterspeak for ganking
---
They weren't as popular or developed as they are today but they absolutely existed. Here's an example sheet for rogues - it looks like the file has long since been archived, but it absolutely existed
---
http://roguecrap.blogspot.com/2006/03/preview-of-my-next-version-of-dps.html?_sm_au_=iVVtHJtkZH2nmnmV
---
Many locations will be mostly unaffected. It's not like there weren't genuinely good AoE farming locations in vanilla. Here's roughly how I think it is in bullet points:
---
Potentially affecting every location:
---
* Incorrect spawn times.
---
* Incorrect exact locations for spawns.
---
* Incorrect number of spawns.
---
* Imprecise "hidden" mob stats (damage, resistances, armour, perhaps in some cases XP yield), but in most cases not health.
---
Potentially affecting some large minority of locations:
---
* Incorrect mob types, due to lack of spawn table systems or otherwise. This could range from a spawn being shared by melee mobs and casters to a spawn being shared by Hillsbrad Farmers and Hillsbrad Farmhands.
---
* Lack of patrolling mobs.
---
* Mobs lacking some abilities or having incorrectly working abilities (including potentially missing a ranged attack that they should have).
---
Potentially affecting some small minority of locations:
---
* Pretty much any item above, except differing enough to make a blatantly obvious substantial difference in gameplay.
---
If you want proof, then I unfortunately can't help you, as to get them one would need access to either Blizzard's internal databases or a time machine. These are just the types of things that are very commonly broken on private servers, and are very difficult to fix because nobody knows how exactly they're supposed to work and the only way to figure that out at this point is by painstakingly crawling through secondary sources like video footage and forum posts, which are not nearly comprehensive enough.
---
It should also be noted that it's much more common for these things to be skewed to be easier, because many of the things in vanilla databases were actually gathered during TBC and WotLK which is when a lot of stuff had already been nerfed by Blizzard to make leveling easier.
---
Dang, I guess no more carrying Azeroth around in my pocket. 
---
That's because its fast = more heroic strikes. 
---
I've seen a lot of sentiment that druids are bad PvP healers because hots can be dispelled. I mean they can be, but my experience with Vanilla was that they rarely were and hots would keep whole teams alive in BGs. I never felt like druids were inferior to any other healer. 
---
I kinda agree and disagree. Absolutely play what you want but be aware some of the racials are very useful in certain situations.
---
The orc stun resist in pvp is amazing, as well as the undead will of the forsaken. Speaking from a horde perspective those two were very strong and can make a difference. 
---
I absolutely agree with having fun making random teams of unlikely classes though, 15 Warlock UBRS run anyone? Playing what you are comfortable is 100% key and it would be a waste to level a dwarf priest if you hate the way they look. Play what makes you happy and screw the rest just be aware rogues trying to sap an orc warrior they might just ignore you :P
---
MP/5 was huge for pallys because they didn't get that 30% casting regen.  MP/5 was never unwelcome but spirit was always preferable due to all kinds of talents that benefit from it.
---
I can’t wait to deny retfags from all my dungeon runs. No amount of gear can beat the salty whispers.
---
If you have fun playing it go for it. For instance, enhancement  shamans weren’t really wanted a ton but when I refilled Horde I had so much fun playing as one. 
---
Till you get a gander of their feet
---
*makes noise*
---
If by random groups you mean 5 mans then I have no doubt people will agree to have you tank.
---
It’s crazy to see that hunter has the lowest class-race combination for horde 
---
Warstomp, 5% hp, and nature resist is good too! Don’t forget the cows. 
---
You're almost certainly wrong.
---
Unless they say they are changing it, the assumption is that it will be the same as it was in vanilla.
---
isn't 2-3 spots fairly low? I feel like those sport will be filled up quick bu then again i dint start playing till TBC
---
Bro I've even seen NIGHTELF Priests lol, play what you want.
---
No way in the world it's going to be 70 gig.  Original wow system requirements was 4 GB. Maybe double that for updated graphics... maybe. 
---
Probably because Horde has more players or more skilled players than Alliance on your pserver to overcome the terrain disadvantages then
---
+144 FPS will be easily achievable on most PCs as long as your CPU is decent.
---
However there comes a 1st world problem of having too much  coil while from the GPU at those high frames. Almost all GPUs will start to whine at such frames especially in WoW and Classic.
---
I did it for my wife... leaving my horde friends to be able to play with her...
---
Only in feral forms, but those still benefit from your stats and bonuses on said gear.
---
I think calling them cancer is waaay too harsh lol. How is that any different than me asking him to play alliance with me? At the end of the day we just want to be together. That’s far more important. 
---
check out this article: https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2018/11/02/how-blizzard-is-updating-warcraft-iiis-fiction-for-reforged 
---
&gt; Do you know what the changes are?
---
The only real one I've heard of is the update to "the culling of Stratholme" mission to reflect how Strat looks in wow. But that won't differ
---
You misspelled Windows 7.  /u/copunic has the right of it IMO.
---
Lol it was a joke. I’ll play a Dwarf the same as Orc brother! No hate, just laughs.
---
Absolutely agree. As someone who cleared through Nax in vanilla. The most important part of wow is having fun, everyone is talking about min/maxing but in reality it doesn’t matter. Yes at the start of Nax it is important but after a few weeks of gearing in Nax without fully clearing even a more casual raiding guild can clear it. As far as PvP goes it really only matters if you are trying to be the best of the best. A Tauren warrior could beat an Orc even tho Orcs are considered the best.  
---
Listen man I play this game a lot but saying Dal Rends swords are 'easy' to get means you need to go outside more. The average person doesn't just chain run UBRS for multiple hours a day with their 9 other autistic friends.
---
Classic will be using bfa engine. Though a good frame rate would not be that hard to get at all.
---
Really? Was it added in BC?
---
Dwarf rogues make the best dagger rogues 
---
Play whatever you want !
---
As long it’s not an Orc , Undead , Troll , Tauren or Gnome
---
Farming the gold farmers in Tyrs Hand... druid with a rogue
---
yes but distracting dagger obviously shouldn't beat out rank 14 swords.
---
even with 25% heroic strike usage TWO of them out perform r14 swords. possibly an issue with your wep skill calculations? Which formula are you using? Athan's? Hermit's? Linear 300-310? Linear with no cap?
---
Think there will be an option for better graphics?
---
Not really. My main was Resto Shaman but I did raid a little on Alliance with a warlock and I don't think we ever had more than 4, 3 was pretty average. Warlocks aren't the best damage but have utility. They'd rather have more warriors/rogues/mages to kill faster.
---
Yet you still engage me in conversation about it!
---
So what happens if something were to change? Would you stop playing? Would you burst into flames? 
---
I'll be playing and enjoying it either way. It'd just be nice if I could be a viable tank as a paladin and they need to adjust the class for it to be worth it.
---
Most world buffs are gonna be on cd in classic anyway so most guilds wont be able to use them. If one guild uses them during prime time, the next guild will have to wait hours to use a world buff.
---
Protection paladins are a different beast. If you want to tank in raids as a paladin, you should be aware of the fact that you simply won't be allowed to do it unless you're in a 20-man raid and the other raid members like memes. This is not about hardcore min-maxing guilds, prot paladin is simply not viable for endgame content.
---
You need to correct the ability usage for rage cause right now it looks like its not keeping track of rage at all?
---
Unbuffed distracting dagger is still the best weapon on the sheet, but without buffs you wouldn't have the rage to use 90% heroics. This is a cool sheet but its missing some critical parts
---
That would be cherry picking comments. What's the ratio of those min-maxxers compared to just regular wow players? And do you think that ratio will be different in official classic?
---
Wintermaul, Dota, sheep tag, run kitty run, uthers party. Anyone else remember playing these custom maps back in the day, shit was amazing.
---
1-60 should get you close.  I recall in Vanilla I leveled 1-60 as Human in NElf and I was about 1/3 the way into revered?
---
The meaning and use of the term prebis has expanded beyond it's literal definition though.
---
if someone asks you how your gear is and you respond "prebis" it's accepted and assumed you don't actually have the absolute best item in every slot pre raid just close enough to be considered about the same. 
---
Does it really matter? No one has issues with insufficient drive storage in 2k19
---
I would love to off tank in raids and switch to DPS after the tanking part is done, but just not seeing that happen.  One because of stiigma, but mostly because work and family will limit my ability to be anything more than an alternate when I am available to raid. 
---
All servers are located in either Chicago or Los Angeles these days.
---
&gt; Many locations will be mostly unaffected.
---
That's literally been my point since my first comment and why Mage is a contender. I provided TWELVE locations that won't be affected enough to matter that offer 40 levels of efficient leveling. 
---
Warriors are really lucky that their bis lvling spec is also bis pvp spec and they get tac mast early which is arguably bis for dungeon tanking. Its nutty
---
Except for the women
---
: /
---
This is a neat website, and it even "remembers" some characters from before server transfers/name changes/etc
---
Well if they don't release it before classic it won't get much play from me for a while, so I hope they release it soon haha
---
You cant even follow a straight conversation... This is actually very amusing.
---
Friend of mine wants to play paladin like he did back in the day.... so. Yes. 
---
absolutely. i often cleared raids with an "not ideal" raid group and we had a good time doing it. while i think its fine to   
---
take certain attributes into consideration (like racial bonuses etc) i don't think people need to stick 100% to the cookie cutter mold of whats best. have fun with it and you'll be fine. 
---
always in stormx shadow
---
The WoW Classic demo looked like it rendered foliage at a greater distance than Vanilla did.
---
Like I said, when it isn‘t your goal to be the best player in PvP on your realm there is no need to min/max and choose an orc for his stun resist racial or an UD for its WotF.
---
Also there is no need to play a Tauren warrior tank just because of the 5% more stamina you get. You will get a spot everywhere as a warrior anyway.
---
Your examples feed the team of the mix/maxers and hardcore players.
---
I don’t know about a large chunk. 20-30% of the pop are RP fans, given how much smaller the classic community is today VS wow in the past. I highly doubt too many people will be that upset, one of the minor gripes people are complaining about because we have nothing to talk about IMO
---
True, but priest is probably the worst. Fort is not a very good levelling buff for a warrior and priests are no fun to play when people take all your killing blows.
---
Why is heroic strike frequency based off an option on the tool instead of being based off how much rage I have / am generating? Is your tool calculating rage anywhere?
---
'The very simple tank rotation for maximum threat is:
---
Maul (on cooldown)
---
Swipe as a rage dump
---
Faerie Fire if situationally unable to Swipe or when building rage'
---
i recently had a guy clown fme or leveling with bear talents instead of cat talents. Was in my early 40s in Swamp of Sorrows. he was super obnoxious and persistent. Eventually i asked him if he tanked dungeons as he leveled, to which he answered yes. I then proceeded to clown him for tanking dungeons in a sub-optimal spec until he ignored me.
---
That sounds good! Should be possible then to reach almost exalted at 40. Thanks!
---
Tanks aren't actually very 'desired' in raids because you don't need many of them and tanks are usually there to stay with their group. I also have reason to believe that there will be more prot warriors than fury warriors in Classic. With that being said, the most desired classes would be Warrior (Fury), Mage and Rogue.
---
Demo alone was 11.5 gigs. But ofc you don't know which content is included and which isn't.
---
Thanks!!
---
Yeah, but also with +20% int from leader of the pack, you can do really well undergeared, compared to other classes.
---
BTW, do u speak Spanish? Where are you going to play? (Realm and region)
---
I highly expected to be playing WC3R right now. I planned on it being the thing to hold me over for Classic. I'll be busy with Classic when that's out so I won't get to dive into the fun customs as much :(
---
God dammit Ilthalaine
---
Remaking my gnome prot warrior, definitely. He’ll be an ugly old female with the beehive hair who never shows her helmet this time around (Extra humiliation in PvP).
---
Resto shaman is gravy train for horde raiding. If you just want to find groups warrior tank is probably the safest bet for levelling through to lvl 60 5mans. You can always switch to dps if you have trouble finding a dedicated tank spot in a raid.
---
!remindme 71 days 
---
You're clearly very upset, and need to reread our short 'discussion' (that I didn't even mean to start) when you're a bit more level headed. When confronted, if you're very heated, your mind tricks you into believing that the confrontee, too, is being hostile. I'm not. 
---
Just try to take my message for what it is, before your initial comment: have some patience and tolerance when dealing with people. It'll reward you.
---
Thank you!!!
---
I play a few different games on 140+ fps without coil whine. I don’t think it’ll be a general problem in wow. I have a GTX 970 so nothing too fancy. 
---
Shamans will always have spots in raids regardless of population simply due to how good their kit is , there can literally be a shaman in every group for a raid and no one would argue about it.
---
Locks on the other hand have much fewer spots in raids ( especially in the early stages of classic ), because their dps is pretty low then compared to mages by quite a large margin ( speaking from a purely pve perspective of course).
---
This wasn't an issue back then because the warlock population was one of the lowest but I'm not sure about classic, it seems a lot of people are rolling lock because of free mount/farming character / easy epics ( they think), might end up with over population for locks especially with the small amount of slots available for them in raids.
---
Locks might end up facing the same issues hunters have in regards to competitiveness for spots. 
---
&gt;The only source of a white damage on a vael sim would be from extra attacks in practice
---
And offhand

---
Oof, I want to get 60 in about 5 days /played time. Now I’m wondering if I should tell my buddy we should just solo
---
I mean they have to have classic specific servers for it to be in anyway like vanilla was.
---
:)
---
Maul on cooldown means that you hit your Maul keybind after every swing. It's the same as "Heroic Strike on CD", it just means that you spam it. 
---
yeah that was a blast from the past. been in the same guild for 13 damn years. yikes how time flies, been playing casually since MoP but the memories live on
---
I spent like 80% of the raid speaking in Dwarvish. Probably not what you had in mind. 
---
&gt;streamers
---
&gt;hardcore players
---
Fucking omegalul name one
---
Clearly you are trolling. Get out of here troll priest.
---
If you hadn't stopped reading there you would have noticed the list of stuff potentially affecting every location immediately following that sentence. Even the simplest of areas that only spawn a single type of mob can get lots of things wrong that can make them more effective than they should be. They just won't be spawning raptor wizards like you suggested.
---
Someone more motivated than myself should put together a compilation of short video clips from elite vanilla raiding guilds. I'm sure many of those guilds were raiding with NE/Human priests, NE/Gnome warriors and rogues, and other "sub-optimal" combinations. 
---
I mean doesnt that totally depend on the role play? 
---
Mfw viskag/thrash is bis human warrior setup for t1 before brut is added to tables, excluding ironfoe memes
---
Love the salt. Being able to make crazy macros was a part of classic and TBC too really. I didn't abuse macros too heavily, but I had a one button macro hunter alt I did farm raids with.... How else am I supposed to raid and eat dinner/drink a 12 pack at the same time? This was a vital part of my experience.
---
Yeah they're totally going to delay release to add something into the game they saw a random nobody suggest on Reddit. They either already planned on it or they're not going to do it. Get real. 
---
Well I don’t think they are going to spend a lot of money marketing something that only requires a sub to play.   I’m sure they will a little once it’s around the corner or out already 
---
;(
---
Sure, I get that.  But taking this back to the original comment, /u/__Dave_ got downvoted for saying:
---
&gt; I get your general point, but the Thrash Blade is definitely not pre-raid BiS.
---
He was trying to simply point out an inaccuracy -- going around telling people that "X is pre-raid bis" when in fact *it absolutely is not* is not a good way to be a helpful contributor to a community.
---
I utterly disagree. I played on RP-PVP servers from the day they were released. I'm in a few different discord servers with several hundred people who were fully committed to paying on such a server. 2 of my real life friends have informed me they probably wont join me in playing WoW if the servers aren't there for them. Sure, it's probably not the biggest fraction of the playerbase, but it's still a substantial amount, and certainly enough to warrant 1 RP-PVP server at lease.
---
Ya, there were some people on classic cast the other day who were talking about "giving away" 5 guides to listeners and I just laughed and though "oh shit they think people will actually pay for that, in this day and age? Wow"
---
The biggest thing about speed leveling is to get ahead of the pack as soon as possible so you don't have as much competition for mobs. 
---
That's just not happening as duo.
---
&gt; change the game nontrivially
---
I can absolutely guarantee you 99% of the people playing this game either won't notice or won't give a single fuck. It's almost the definition of nontrivial.
---
Just popping in to say that Tauren aren't the best horde warriors, orcs and trolls both beat them at generating threat.
---
Protection paladins do a great job in a few raids and are always viable as offtanks and are considered as the best tank for large mobgroups. Later in Naxxramas they‘re actually great to have. Combined with a retri in group a dedicated prot pally player can shine. His group has to play differently though and have to give him time to raise some aggro due to a lack of a regular taunt spell.
---
You have to put some more effort into your playstyle than a warrior tank but you play what you wanted to play and that must be the goal!!
---
I won't bash anyone for what they pick. But you can't fault people for wanting an optimal build for what they want to do. 
---
And it isn't like gameplay dramatically changes by picking an optimal race. An orc hunter is almost exactly the same gameplay wise as a troll in pvp, he'll just be more successful. 
---
Another thing to consider is your class. If you're playing a melee class, cooking is very valuable. Hunters, mages etc not so much. 
---
To be fair, playing with friends as any faction is better than playing by yourself with a faction you like, unless you were planning to roll one of the exclusive classes I'd say stick with your friends.
---
Off topic a bit , unless you are planning to only do wpvp with your friends I think you could've done a better argument for the alliance, given that alliance is superior in any group content be it pvp/pve in comparison to horde, if you don't believe me just check the thousands of threads showcasing why alliance is better in group content in general.
---
Although, having played both factions it feels like the alliance falls more into the safety in numbers/ stick together and the horde is more of a wild/adventurous spirit full of loud noises and a livelier feel , at least that's how it felt to me after playing both ( in a vanilla context ).
---
The 1.13 client will have a vast majority of the blot cut from its retail counterpart. A safe bet would be between 15-25 GB. 
---
if your friend is going to play for 1.5 months tell him to suck it up and join you on alliance. that's nothing considering how long you'd be playing. Only reason I'm going horde is because I know 4-5 people that are going horde, one of which has extensive p server experience main tanking on a warrior and he's adamant about going horde. I'll be sticking with him lol. If I only had 1 friend that I was sure wasn't gonna stick around for long, I would not go horde just to please him and regret it 2 months down the line

I suspect that anybody who is interested in classic wow already knows about classic wow.
---
It's not like they're going to spin up a massive ad campaign for the normies. "Come play a 15 year old game!!!" doesn't sell well.
---
Now that's very subjective.
---
I mean, it's not like there's more than one person/opinion on an internet forum right?
---
Nostalrius / Anathema / Kronos2 / Lightbringer / Northdale.
---
The most populated servers of each "fresh" iteration since Nost launched. Every server before nost didnt even have aq40 or naxx released because scripting was so poor until Nost came around.
---
We like playing vanilla what can we say.
---
Neat site, I was able to find some characters but not all of mine, was even able to look up names I had before transfers. 
---
Thanks for linking this! :) 
---
A lot of the time they were referred to as "spirits" in WC3 and vanilla WoW. I don't recall hearing the term "Loa" in classic.
---
" Nightfall hunter is a meme. They have slightly higher uptime but they just sit on a boss and spam the button every GCD. Not really fun when your rotation is one of the few in vanilla that isn’t mashing the same button. You don’t need to be survival if you go Nightfall. Just give Trueshot to melees and spam r1 Wing Clip."  
---
How is this different than a warrior doing it? They also have a complex rotation that is now reduced to spamming hamstring. I am just wondering, trying to figure out how to manage Nightfall in our guild.
---
I feel like this "I don't know what to play" scenario is brought on more by the actual original Vanilla population such as myself who has never played private servers but remembers how serious even the most casual of raiding guilds were about playing/bring the "right spec". For example Rets, Shadow Priest, Boomkins did not exist in groups period.  Now later towards Naxx things got balanced and there was more diversity but early on it just didn't make sense. For Classic though I think it will be different and I don't think things will be as cut and dry because so much more is known now that wasn't known before.
---
Yeah, I remember that guy being around. Your name also sounds familiar, but it has been a long time. Closer to tbc release is when I was in silithis more. Would sometimes pvp with a feral druid named Skuse.
---
I'm hoping to see more familiar names when classic comes out if I have any time to play
---
same here (germany), although the quality is ass and the buffering unbearable 
---
Competitive edge to people who *do* view it as a race. I don't like to race, you don't like to race, but some people do and they should have their fun as well. They're just different.
---
You‘re right noone is forced to play with certain guilds/groups. If the guild doesn‘t want feral in their MC roster it may be a limited view but ok, everyones right to do so. Imo only hardcores will do that because it is really senseless to limit your raid to a few class/race combos unless you want your world/server firsts. And there is another problem: You still have to fill your roster of 40 man, it‘s harder than it sounds like.
---
Apparently I cant tell you the names of the servers we've been on but we've been on the main servers since Nost. 5 of them.
---
&gt;I would like to actually read at least one part of the guide just to understand why anyone would pay money for it, I don't see why that's bad.
---
&gt;
---
Me too; I'm really curious, but I guess I'll never find out: I'm not curious enough.
---
&gt;Also just to point it out, I never downvote replies to my posts so that's not me doing it.
---
Okay, gotcha, thanks for letting me know.
---
Err, War3 came out 2 year before WoW, (1 if we're talking TFT), I don't think they should do that.
---
He'd be fine finding raids man. So few guilds are hardcore progression guilds, the only place where it really matters that much, and OP is clearly not that calibre.
---
Classic, Vanilla, and Pservers will all have their own numbers.  Fact.  Blizzard has 1.12 numbers, but it still needs to be "translated" into retail.  Pservers are all guess, but it's up to the person to decide how close they got.
---
But, if I were to guess, I don't think much would change from pservers.  Whatever the hell Blizz did to tanking 1.11+ documented or not, pretty much gave every dps class the ability to go ham.
---
0 Elites on the route to the tower.
---
Right, but that is explaining how they're making Strat like Classic WoW. 
---
Dunno but hope so. For me it's the gameplay and content that counts, so they may polish it up a bit for me.
---
The testament to classic's balance and design is the literal endless parade of people completely frozen on their character choice. Pretty much everything is great, and every single race/class combo is at least good.   
---
Another good signal is the constant whining from every class about how their class is underpowered compared to X. If everything is underpowered, is any of it actually underpowered or are you the individual just not a swiss army knife god like you are on retail? I seriously cannot wait for classic to come out, come on blizz just give us a date so I can request leave already!

why are there so many edgy horde fanatics? It's actually mind boggling. I swear its either a 13 year old or a 40 year old with a large beard and horde tattoo on their shoulder. Can't seem to find many of the "regular" horde players commenting on these types of threads.

I am tempted to roll PvE to minimize being griefed and downtime, but I crave shenanigans.  Wat do?
---
I don't think we're going to see a massive marketing campaign for this game because there's no upfront cost for it. 
---
I'd imagine most we're getting is them doing rounds at all the gaming outlets, and maybe buy a shit ton of banner ads/twitch and youtube ads.
---
Honestly, even in Vanilla Naxx, race will barely mean fuckall when raiding with a full group of competent and well geared players. Naxx will be no cakewalk at first but if all 40 players have good gear and are good players, the bosses will melt.
---
The only real way I see races *truly* mattering is for guilds who are going for raid clear speed runs, which I actually see being a popular thing once Classic is out for a while. 
---
Where are you reading that random groups won’t let you bear tank? They’re perfectly fine in all dungeons and even can do some raid tanking. Some people say they’re better than warriors for dungeons. 
---
I will add though, I personally find bear tanking pretty boring. Compared to tanking as warrior. Just less buttons.
---
They aren't members of the opposing faction, they're members of neutral factions.
---
Very nice will give them all a listen tomorrow.
---
Best immersion is in game music. :D
---
All that's missing is a keg and copious amounts of Jack Daniel's, and it would be the funeral I'd plan for myself. 
---
I never played on an rp server but did play on an rppvp server. The allure is that most players are older and more mature. They enter the game expecting people to play ‘for real’. You don’t get made fun of if you want to play in character, etc. 
---
Pvp because... well pvp realms are more fun. 
---
Are you talking about battlegroups? We don't know yet. All we know is battlegrounds is going to be released in phase 2.

tfw u roll horde for the PvP racials but die to a night elf priest anyway
---
If memory serves me right only one black lotus can spawn in any able zone whit 4 able zones sand they respawn ones every hour that makes 4 times 24 posible spawns per day that is 96. 7 days a week gives 672 posible lotus. So 16 raids can buff 40 ppl and some random raids can buff tanks sins av spawn lotus if you are lucky make it 17 raids that can use it for 2h no chance of all raiders using flasks
---
I must disagree. We had atleast 2 Boomkins in our roster, they didn‘t contribute to the raids success like a mage of course but they were there when we had memorable moments and we did it with them! But the effort you have to put into your character is much much more like having stacks of manapots, dark/demonic runes and whatsoever. 
---
Shadowpriests had one spot in general to put em in healergroup and to boost the warlocks damage.
---
I agree. The game is more about reactivating old accounts and getting an income from that. Maybe there will be more players that quit over the years upgrading their account to current expansion then there will be new accounts just for classic. 
---
Having played a lot of classic AV recently it does feel alliance favored, thats the only thing there that i can agree with lol. 
---
My brother and I were Spankntank and Spanknheal. Prot warrior and Holy Priest
---
Honestly, I farmed AV to exalted rep for the offhand and people were just happy to have healers period. I loved healing as a druid and it was fun to stealth around when needed. Hots are not very mana-efficient in raids for the most part (sometimes you want to throw them on the tank), but in pvp in short battles, hots are fine and fun to throw around.
---
I played most of my time in classic and had a shaman at one point.  You’d be playing exclusively resto in raids.  It’s fun once you can start getting other class’ loot (once people are geared enough to not need it) such as a high tier 2h to piss people off in pvp with random wind fury chain procs.    
---
So yea, raiding was spamming chain heal and trying not to piss too many people off with loot.  PvP was spamming chain heal, or running enhance/windfury with a 2hand so you could absolutely murder every 10th person you encountered.  
---
If he was a true hunter he would have sent in his faithful beast companion and cast Bestial Wrath to tear that moose to shreds. Or at least cast aimed shot and just kite. Feign death means no loot!
---
To be fair balance druids weren't even that bad with the right *RAID* group. If you are caster heavy, the caster group with the boomchicken is going to love it.
---
I agree that the definition can generally include a few different items that are very close to the literal BiS item but that still wouldn't include the Thrash Blade. It's an okay sword to start raiding with in a pinch but it's significantly worse than Dal'Rend's.
---
You know some people were saying that Horde players should give Alliance a chance and experience new content. I scoffed. 
---
But today while questing in Tera something truly diabolic: If I play Alliance I can learn where all the Alliance players are and how to infiltrate better as  Rogue!
---
Now Instead of waiting for Alliance to come to The Barrens or Ogrimmar I can go to them. :)
---
Level 13 gnome chilling in starter zone? Dead. 
---
Level 10 Human warrior mining copper? Dead. 
---
And Night Elf Druids? Better kill them at level 9 before they get gear form. 
---
Similar, but different issue for me.  I want to play on a PvE server.  My friend wants to play PvP.
---
If you're an altoholic and love to play all the playstyles so you're never bored roll druid.
---
If you like tanking go druid, druids are the best dungeon tanks hands down and will have off-tanking spots in most raids , even aq 40.
---
On some vanilla servers a meta has developed for warriors initiating fights without shields to maximize threat generation in the first few seconds , this also means that all dps warriors are pseudo off tanks trying to generate the maximum threat possible under the tank in case aggro ever drops from MT due to whatever reason it would jump to the next warrior who would then equip a shield and tank.
---
If this meta continues into classic then it changes things because it is moving away from the crushing blows immunity playstyle of old and more into the max threat generation which makes druids who have amazing threat generation quite good at off tanking in raids.
---
I wish they would add some microtransaction to the reforged edition, would love extra armours and skins for units.
---
Dal'rend's is pre-raid BiS for swords. No one really counts UBRS as a raid.
---
It’s a valid point though, some of us would prefer to trade off that versatility for more specialization or depth in a given role.
---
Your point is valid too of course. But I *don’t* want to be a watered down warrior/rogue/caster even if I can switch between them.
---
Nope
---
Your title should have been "A list of things that will be expected of you by people who have been playing pservers for the last 10 years"
---
But thankfully that group of people will be an extreme minority in classic.
---
Doesn't the back door require wall jumping to be possible? I know they've said wall jumping will definitely not be possible.
---
RP still gets trolled on PvE, it's just your faction that does it and you can't kill them back.
---
"haha I got you to reply xd truld"
---
Great way to get blocked.
---
Wow, look at ms triangle head...
---
Yeah he made a joke dissing my misuse of english grammar and I told him not to quit his current job to work at as a comedian cause he would be bad at it. Do you know what that phrase means?
---
Ideally you'd have more than one fear ward.  Every additional fear ward you have is an additional melee that can DPS through the fear.
---
It's more that people want to know the pros and cons of each setup before they invest 2+ months leveling that setup.
---
It was just an example of mine. Nobody should a racial decide what to play or not to play.
---
Found the elf!
---
Deary me
---
How small does a raid have to be in order to be considered a mini raid?
---
&gt;we cleared AQ40 back in vanilla with a totally out of line raid setup. We had feral dps, lots of hunters even Retri paladins. We marched different but it was so much fun and we were successfull!
---
If your raid is caster heavy you are doing it wrong
---
People forget what wiping repeatedly feels like. People also seemingly forget that you have to actually all leave the instance and rezone and re-clear trash in order to repair - no repairbots in Vanilla. 
---
The people that don’t know this will rage so hard at the loss of every little convenience/shortcut put into retail over the years. The “let’s explore and learn together” crowd will crash and burn when the frustration creeps in. 
---
Think of it like a point system.  In general, a bad dwarf priest will be dropped for a good human priest.  But if the two are relatively equal, a group is going to choose the dwarf.
---
Yeah play what you want, but don't act surprised and get upset when serious players don't want your shit specs and invite a dwarf priest instead of your NE
---
Put your head in the sand if you want, you'll face reality at some point.
---
WEREMOOSE!

Ain’t nuthin better than them thicc dwarven wimmins!
---
Ooh, I think that's quite nice. Would almost like that for my wall. Found a highres of that too here: https://luftwaffe.3dn.ru/fullmap.jpg
---
You call the guy a "kiddo" then use the word "cringe". You're just making yourself look more dumb.
---
No, Prot is unviable in raids, outside of picking up adds or certain trash packs.
---
You have less health, much less defenses, much less threat generation, SO much less gear to choose from, no taunt, no cooldowns, no way to become uncrushable (even with Redoubt + Holy Shield, you still don't have enough block to become uncrushable), can run out of mana really easily.
---
No amount of "playstyle" can make you tank raid bosses as well as a Warrior can.
---
Yeah it'll be weird either way you slice it. 
---
There will be entire portions of the playerbase who have never played the game but already know exactly what their leveling and gearing routes will be. When we started back then we didn't even know what a "BiS" item was and we were amazed when we opened our map to learn that there was another whole continent!
---
Mostly I just hope folks don't rely on guides too much. Seeing the content for yourself on your character is special. Learning how to do something inside the game is nice and adds to the immersion. Even asking in General helps to meet people. Most people didn't expect guildies to watch "Raid Guide Videos" until TBC, and even then it was maybe Black Temple or Sunwell when it was expected. So for the entirety of Vanilla everything I was seeing when I wandered into a new zone or saw a new raid boss for the first time was fresh and exciting.
---
I mean, the first time I saw all of Naxx (and the rest of the C'Thun fight) was on a pserver stream years ago when I didn't think I'd ever have a chance to see it.
---
Folks played all games differently back then, and though we went after min/maxing we knew that WoW was not completely studied and the first cookie-cutters were still freshly made. Class guides were basically FAQs at the top of the general forums where lots of people discussed the best practices and gave their consensus. Now it seems like there's so many levels of guides and analysing and videos that it must be so overwhelming to some random person who has never played WoW before. The easy example is how the word "viable" once meant something entirely different.
---
Time will tell, but either way it will be interesting to see how it works out. My guess is it won't be nearly as extreme as on the pservers - but it will be 100% influenced by their meta, just depends which server/guild you play on as to how much. Even on pservers some guilds didn't care much about world buffs, while others were super enthralled by them for every.single.raid.
---
I often see poeple who are anxious about not getting a raid spot when they play „unusual“ combos. Like if NE priests wouldn‘t get a Raidspot because they don‘t have fearwards. It is amusing and saddening at the same time. 
---
You have your hunter(s) name their pets after your Druid and make it harder for the enemy to target your FC. 
---
Hi, /u/MJV888
---
I'd take smallpox blankets over the Kleenex tissues that seem to be standard issue for Alliance.
---
Yepp, it's not like math didn't exists in 2004.
---
It's interesting that this feature was in Beta but did not make it to the live version of the game at launch. I wonder what the reasoning for that was.
---
A Stormwind wedding with fewer than 20 deaths is seen as a dull affair. 
---
If you're doing the hardest content in the game, but intentionally gimping yourself by not using consumables.  Are you not "trying harder" than the guy, who is using them?
---
There are some floating about but you need a bit of programming knowledge to use them as they're not very noob friendly or intuitive to run
---
Resto Shamans are always needed in raids.
---
ill take one :D
---
haha yea paladins are girls!
---
So from what he said, you're right. So thanks for the link to shed some actual light on it.
---
The missunderstanding comes from that it was a technical limitation later when they actually wanted to increase the cap. (which he also states) 
---
Well, my thought process is that I will play both sides simultaneously, because most of my game time will be at night (due to my arrangement with my wife) and my friend will play during the day, so unless he also plays at night (unlikely) I’m going to have that time to play what I want - Alliance
---
I think people will only really care during Onyxia, since having dwarf priests is so helpful there. Races matter a lot more for pvp than pve in general imo.
---
it depends if you are grinding mobs or questing, if questing just go solo, but lets face it, if you want low /played you will be questing a fu\*k ton.
---
Even girls can be warriors! Paladins are weaker than girls!
---
I found out from a friend I rarely see a few months ago, and wouldn’t know about it otherwise. I had even gone up to read on the current state of wow right before that, because I was interested in getting back into it, and didn’t find out anything about classic, only that I couldn’t go back to retail. If that friend hadn’t told me I still wouldn’t know, and I’m interested enough I’ll have multiple 60s/raid/etc.
---
I don’t really know how they would advertise it though, you’re right that the 15-year old angle isn’t great.
---
Just one RP-PvP server will not be low populated in US. You can probably add one for EU too.
---
They haven't released a realm list. XD Or I would tell you.
---
And leader of the pack requires you to have int in the first place; which you get from gear.
---
There’s a lot of confusion about this but it’s not technical a wall jump, it’s a pixel jump. Wall jumps are the ones that require you to spam jump in order to literally climb up a wall.
---
The backdoor jump is just 1 jump where you have to land on a very specific spot. People were able to get into the WSG files on the demo - the pixel jumps were still in the game but the wall jumps were disabled
---
The Shadow Priest thing didn't happen until later in Naxx. I never saw one or any Boomys from MC through AQ.
---
Everyone in the world knows about wow. And once classic releases I would not be surprised to see 500k-1m twitch viewers, as nearly every streamer at leats intends to try it again
---
One of the reasons Classic is happening *at all*is that it can be done very cheaply. They'll be reusing most if not all of the assets that go into make this game, so the costs from a development perspective are minimal. They're not about to dump millions of dollars into an ad campaign for it.
---
It would be kinda neat to see some hype videos for classic like the "Warbringers" series they did for BfA. I think if we want to see those, we'll need to make them ourselves, however.
---
I'd rather play with a competent priest of any race than some garbo player that rolled dwarf because all the guides told them to.
---
That's true, are you playing on a LATAM realm if they release.one?
---
You can kill Onyxia with 40 shadow priests. I guess tanks and healers are unnecessary, right?
---
Just because you CAN do something, doesn't mean that you should do it, nor does it mean that way is the best way to do it.
---
I think Ion is trying to impress the bosses and keep spending low. Meaning fewer servers. Ion probably thinks Classic will be a bust.
---
Tru, if you're working evenings and play late at night hit me up and we'll group up sometime. Work till midnight myself so I'm with you on the whole having to go solo thing. But I've been finding others in the same situation and trying to get enough of us together to maybe get a late night guild.
---
17 raids a week that's more than enough.
---
Priest is a different beast entirely. When it comes to Priest, your race DOES matter, because you get different racial Priest abilities.
---
Dwarf priests are ALWAYS in demand, Fear Ward is just an insanely useful tool. By choosing to not roll Dwarf, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage. You are choosing to NOT take that incredibly useful tool.
---
Facepalm. You didn‘t understand what i was talking about or either you didn’t read my post don’t you? We gave nothing to an optimal raid setup back than and STILL CLEARED AQ40. So where is the meaning of limiting your own roster to a few classes and combos considering it is really hard to even maintain a stable 40 man playerpool for your raids.
---
i'm not sure whether or not he thinks classic will be a bust. he was a pretty passionate player and did seem genuinely offended when modern players were asking him about ''the REAL game'', but then again there are also people who loved the hell out of vanilla and to this day talk about how it'll fail in today's society. idk, yo
---
i DO agree that he's either trying to impress the bosses by cutting costs OR the bosses themselves see rp-pvp servers as something they can easily cut
---
If you jump up and get stuck on an invisible floating platform that's a wall jump. There were plenty of spots where you didn't have to spam jump you just did 2 or 3 regular jumps just like that av cliff. I'd be more on the side that the backdoor won't work, but obviously I could be wrong.
---
World buffs wouldn't even assist fresh raid releases anyway, unless the entire raid group knows every single encounter by heart and executes it all perfectly.
---
Night elf is actually pretty decent as you get 1% dodge from racial also earlygame before you get access to thunderfury the threat bonus from weapon skill doesn't outweigh the added survivability.
---
No.  Not waiting any longer for Classic.  
---
You can still play WC3 on you’re grandma’s laptop.  
---
But tauren reach the 10k buffed (important for naxx) mark faster than other races so focus on threat gear earlier. 
---
i was really really looking forward to playing on a rp-pvp server, so to find out i might not even have them is pretty depressing. i guess i'll play on a rp server as that won out over the pvp aspect, but i would kill to have them in at launch. i guess if they're added later i'll roll an alt on one for fun, but i can't justify playing for months and then transferring or rerolling and uprooting myself from my current community, which bums me out tbh. justice for rp-pvp servers
---
Probably not, since I live in the US, but I am sure there will be plenty of everyone no matter which server I pick. 
---
Fuck my friends. I'm going to play Alliance and gank them all.
---
In Vanilla, I remember avoiding full strength Healing Touch like the plague, focussing on Tank Healing with a Priest, using Rejuv, Low Rank HT, and Regrowth for recovery. High Rank HT was only ever used when you were able to predict a big spike in damage far enough out that your 3s cast (talented) would land just after a big hit and not be sniped by the Paladin who couldn't stay on his own target.
---
According to some of the guides I looked at, High Rank HT will be our "go to" spell.  What happened on Private Servers and is this valid?
---
He's stated in some Discord at one point that the cap was more or less 2.5k  and that the technical limitation was 4k. 
---
He has said that the cap could go up and down, my guess is that it had to do with how many players were in any given zone. The AQ launch for example would be more taxing for the server because everyone was in Silithus so it's an instance of let's say 2k being more difficult for the server to handle than 3k would be on a regular night.
---
&gt;Why do other healers feel entitled to my Innervate?
---
Nevah! Unless they're giving you ... favours ;-)
---
Activision Blizzard did lay off 800 employees earlier this year, mostly from the marketing departments. That may be a contributing factor as well. 
---
It comes down to "feck everyone else, just don't expect most folk to cater to your niche".
---
Everything and everyone has a slot they can fit in, it's just a matter of finding the right lads to fill the other required ones.
---
A great personality or an industrious spirit goes a long way when going off the meta.
---
Iirc Classic should have the same graphics *settings* as modern wow, so things like anti-aliasing and render distances should be improved. 
---
My zerg guild with 2 ret paladins and a perma-drunk Russian tank on Nostalrius cleared BWL, which was actually harder than on live due to phase 1 Nef shooting shadowbolts at the ENTIRE RAID at the time.
---
If you want to min-max that's fine, but if it's not your thing, you REALLY don't need to be worried about it.
---
That sounds great!  I do prefer to make guild decisions while in game personally, but a lot of people like to have a home from the beginning.  So that is fantastic.  I already have a few ideas on what server I want to play on if it is an option so that could be an issue as well, but definitely good luck.  I'll hope to see you in the world.
---
It's the type of behavior I expect from dishonorable hordies =p, but since Classic will have PVE servers there's no excuse for anyone to complain about being ganked. On pservers which are basically all pvp you have to deal with it and just suck it up, but on Classic you have the option to opt out.
---
New models. Yikez.
---
It does take a lot of games afk to grind the rep... 
---
Make sure y’all remember to download Winamp. 
---
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  You are right in that part.  You never know, might end up liking it better in the end.
---
Good point! There are only 2 kinds of players: the Hardcore™ ones and the Casuals™. 
---
The Hardcore™ ones have no friends, hate the game, hate other players, and will oppress the poor little casuals. Naturally, they pick dwarf priests, human/orc melee, gnome casters etc. If you ask a hardcore player for advice, they will say "be gone, casual peasant, you reek of bad choices!" and then spit on you. They only play because they like following guides and showing off their big dick dps and speed-clears in raids. Do not attempt to talk to them!
---
Casuals™ will pick whatever they find pretty and don't care about the racials. They have a lot of friends, love the game, love other players, and have an all-round good time if they ever choose to log in. Unfortunately, they will be highly discriminated against. They will be barred from some guilds because they are of an inferior race. 
---
The most important part here is that **hardcore players do not have fun**. The guides, streams, and discussions are actually meant to oppress casuals. If you see a spreadsheet, do not hesitate to avoid gestapo. 
---
 \#ourwivesmatter
---
I believe that is partially what I'm referring to. You can play with anyone on any server now. During Vanilla/BC (possibly WotLK?) the servers were isolated. So I had to play on Mal'Ganis if I wanted to play with my friends there. (I'm not exactly sure what this is called)

---
*looks in your direction with a full stack of reckoning*
---
I see that you are a mix/maxer and hardcore player. I agree with you absolutely that fearwards are incredibly useful but choosing to play a freaking ugly dwarf while you cuddling with your - compared to dwarfes -beautiful NE priest is mindblowingly dumb. I never saw a guild to sort out a NE priest or rejecting them even if they are recruiting priests because they don‘t have a fearward.
---
Like i said before limiting yourself to a few classes and combos is senseless because you still have to maintain a stable 40 man roster which also is a major challenge.
---
The description text for this post.. lol. 
---
But honestly if you are a casual player like me then don't listen too much to the talk that you have to heal as a druid. You can be a cat or a bear and do fine and clear all the 5 mans and even some of the raids perfectly fine. If you do decide to go more hardcore then, yes you will heal but you will be a pretty viable healer. 
---
The heart of the wild powershifting play-style is super fun, varying and pretty comfortable. Not much downtime and lots of survivability. Another big bonus is that you can both tank and heal dungeons so you will never have to wait forever to make a group. Druid is a fun, flexible and unique class that I recommend to anyone thinking about it.  
---
There are no girls on the internet, though some of the voice modulators on Ventrillo are really good.
---
Man this is awesome, thanks a bunch for sharing! I'm going to save them and wait to listen until classic launches for an extra blast from the past. 
---
They are allocated in the US just grouping for language
---
Agree. I'm pretty festered by the amount of guides, tips, hints and tricks are flying about. People are so desperate to cane the fuck out of levelling they are going to ruin the game for themselves. 
---
Take your time, this isn't retail. 
---
First off I being able to tank is going to get you in wayyyy more groups than being able to summon. It’s a nice to have as lock, but people still would usually rather have a mage.
---
I’m planning on maining lock. Idc about raid viability, I would have been happy being a resto druid in raids and am sure I’d find a spot with one. So I didn’t choose it bc of that.
---
I chose because I just like the feel more. On paper just dotting stuff does sound kind of boring, but leveling lock you can chain pull like a mofo, and it becomes this game of balancing your resources with how aggressive you want to be. Which is true for all classes, but I find it particularly fun as lock. With druid, you will usually be burning mobs down single-target.
---
I find lock to be more OP for solo open world stuff. Try to solo an elite higher than you on both classes. It’s doable on both, but it’s stupid easy on lock, mostly because fear. Now certain things you can get done way faster on druid because of movement speed and stealth. For questing druid is definitely faster. Overall though I find lock and hunter easier to play in solo PvE. Could be a playstyle thing.
---
Soul shard farming won’t really be a thing if you don’t raid or PvP. The pet training books are right next to your class trainer, that’s a non issue.
---
Hunter is going to be better than either for solo PvE, it’s like lock but you get movement speed.
---
Ultimately all three are excellent solo classes. It should come down to what you think looks coolest, class fantasy, and just how good the class feels to you.

I feel that, ideally, the vast majority of players won't be the ones lurking on the subreddit or forums.  Most won't care one way or another what the most optimal build is, or what specific public personalities decide to play.  Most around here have a general idea of what they are looking at in the big picture.
---
Because if you’re horde, Heroic Strike frequency is likely 0, because you rage dump with hamstring to bait for Windfury Procs. 
---
i had some weird keyboard  that let me control windows media player without needing to alt tab out. kinda miss that keyboard lol. im pretty sure every one of my friends used a different music program as well. I'd say don't forget to download AIM as well because there was no Bnet launcher to check who was around if the servers were down, but AIM got shutdown a couple years ago im pretty sure.

Simming is fine.  As long as whatever tool made doesn't start inspecting and rating other players, personal development is great.
---
When it becomes GearScore or "This other person's gear is wrong", it becomes damaging.
---
Make sure they enjoy the game for the fun, before you give them homework ;-)
---
I have my own philosophy around what race class combos I choose, and I couldn’t care less if it’s not optimal. For example, I love the dwarves racial of Finding Treasure, but you can only have one tracking on at a time - so I will make my rogue a dwarf with a skinning profession because skinning benefits a leather wearer (unlike a warrior) and doesn’t require tracking and neither does the rogue class (unlike, say, hunter or paladin), leaving my tracking slot free for finding treasure ☺️
---
That’s just one example - I’m an alt addict, so I plan on having 8 characters (one of each class) without repeating a race more than twice (thus having two toons of every race), plus 2 bank alts, thus maxing our my character limit on a server. 
---
I will then run every single alt to a main city, so they can gather rested xp AND effectively serve as my bank alts until such a time that I decide to play them.
---
You think I’m wasting my time because there’s no way I’ll level all of them to 60? I don’t care, that’s how I wanna play 
---
People dont realize that nearly no one actually used buffs back then. Dragonslayer buff had like an 8 hour cooldown. Black lotus 1-2h good luck popping multple flasks and shit on 40 people on a regular basis unless you have a flower mafia

---
the best music in vanilla was easily jindos area in ZG for me. im not even sure that music is in the game anymore since all the troll stuff has been redone like 7x since then.
---
The bigger problem in Vanilla was that Blizzard was trying to disguise the formulas so the accuracy of tools was questionable.
---
I don’t blame you for using the gear. It’s not your fault the design of the game was flawed. I used badge gear too, you adjust to your circumstances after all. 
---
If you roll a dwarf holy priest you are litterally a shoe in for any raid.
---
They are waiting by design.  Reforged will come late, that way you get energized to kill arthas so they can do classic up to WoTLK.  This will sum up the classic trilogy perfectly.

---
Hehe, your implication here does not take into consideration that people have been farming this content for decades, know every little detail about everything in vanilla and could almost do the first few raid tiers blindfolded. The most dedicated guilds will probably have MC &amp; Onyxia cleared within a week or two of release. This would, however, be without world buffs, because Dire Maul won't be out on release and you'd need to kill Onyxia at least once before you can utilize the buff. The only setback with rushing towards max-level and getting a quick kill on Rag is the rep farm needed with Hydraxian Waterlords to get the Aqual Quintessence. So this really comes down to whom can clear MC trash the quickest. 
---
All guilds will not flask if they are smart until final AQ bosses and naxx gear checks. If people aren't saving all of their lotus for that they are not playing smart even in this min Max world
---
And i agreed with you im just also saying its good knowledge to be aware of. 🙂
---
As a fresh tank running on an old server with a lot of very raid geared 60s, I will say that you have a snowball's chance in hell of keeping up in threat with some people if they go all out, even spamming revenge and sunder.  
---
If you're in a group with these uber DPS, tell them to burn down skull, and completely ignore it yourself. Start your tanking rotation with X onward. Skull will die so fast it doesn't matter who is tanking it, and you will have time to anchor X and save taunt for emergent situations. 
---
Nelly Furtado, Ludacris... Oh God, I really miss that time :(
---
You're arguing against the Private Server Douchemafia by telling people what happened in Vanilla.  Because most people who are telling you that endgame is everything are the ones who've been repeating the levelling every 6 months to power through MC to Naxx.
---
Are you referring to raids or grouping up at level 60? 
---
Because if groups then yes tanks are the rarest, then a healer, then dime a dozen DPS. 
---
For raids you can’t go wrong with resto shamans and dwarf priests. The rest largely depends on your guild makeup. 
---
Honestly how you play will make a big difference on how “desirable” you are. Play a high skill ceiling class poorly and no one will go out of their way to invite you. Play whatever class well and you’ll be desired. 
---
They brought *four* hunters to KT and somehow managed to down him? They must surely be akin to gods!
---
Raiding in vanilla is TIME CONSUMING. Your first MC clear can take up to 4 hours+ if you have to stop and explain every boss. You can't skip MC each week and you HAVE to raid it until the end of time if you want thunderfury on your maintank.
---
So ok we spend 4 hours in MC each week no biggie but now we need to clear BWL. That's another four hours. Alright that's two raid days not so bad! Now AQ is out. Clearing AQ blind? You're looking at 2+ raid days per clear. Potentially more. Now imagine trying to find time to clear naxx while juggling MC+BWL+AQ farm nights. It doesn't work.
---
Nobody will join a guild progressing on AQ while naxx is already out when they can join a naxx guild and get carried.
---
So could this type of guild work out in theory? Technically but it would be extremely tedious and unfun and require disgusting amount of playtime.
---
Haha I’ve still got my Logitech G15 keyboard! And yes, make sure to put up an away message. 
---
Wrong spec to defend. Prot paladin might be the worst spec pve raid spec in the game and it gimps your raid 50x as much as some random boomkin lowering raid dps. You'll only tank raids with a paladin if you have a guild that likes you and has serious patience.
---
For 5man content defenitly tank. You can assume 10% tanks of overall population on your server to be tanks 💁🏻‍♂️ 
---
Chances also aren‘t that bad to get a raidspot as tank, especially if you are a high tps tank and know what you are doing 🙃
---
What do you mean hardcore progression? This guy is gonna be hardcore progressing for a long time.
---
Go for it man. I will roll shaman as well. It is what I WANT to play. I prioritize that over my name at the top of the damage meter as rogue/mage or whatever. I may roll enhance.. I may roll elo/enhance. Or resto.. A lot of cool builds that are all enjoyable! :) Every class has downsides.
---
The one you have most fun playing. Good players are always more desirable than good classes.
---
”Hey guys, I’m not hardcore, I just wanna play 8-10h per day” 🤣🤷🏻‍♂️👌🏻

I didn't play Vanilla as a kid as it seems most people on this subreddit  I don't have rose tinted glasses. I liked Vanilla but I don't want it to be a static world just for nostalgia. 
---
If any mmo launch ever is anything to go by, I would be terrified of building hype.
---
And no, sharded expansion launches are not comparable. If they shard as intended, then i'll be less woried about the stability part.
---
There are at least 2 million people who will try it in the first week. This is info based on the last few "big new launches" 
---
Tons of elites from the castle to the gates and tons of elites at the tower, there is a small window with no elites though, just be careful since people group for that quest 
---
I mean, don’t the quests usually just send you to the next region at the end of quest lines?
---
It’s hard to put them in order because you don’t complete zones directly. You jump in between them because most of them offer quests to various level ranges
---
Ungoro soil planted in hillsbrad grows human beans.
---
Why do you think it’s outdated? The game has not been patched ever since. 
---
Generally, that is until you have to go to the other continent and start leveling there. Around the mid-20s. 
---
Routes have been developed and improved a lot. Most fast levellers don’t use it. 
---
Hi, hardcore player here. If you ask me for advice, I will help you to the best of my ability. I do like showing off my big dick dps in raids and I enjoy the challenge of a speed clear. I will respond to any whisper I get, so feel free to talk to me. I have a lot of friends who will be playing, I love the game, likely more than you do based off of this comment. I like other players and treat everyone with respect. I won't be discriminated against, and I won't be barred from some guilds because I won't be picking an inferior race. 
---
You should play whatever you want 👍🏻

Dude you're just being pedantic.
---
So long as you have one of the items from the pre raid BiS list for every slot, you're considered to be pre raid BiS geared, even by the most hardcore guilds.
---
Literally no one say "I've got #3 pre raid BiS weapon", they just say the got preBiS weapon and everyone moves on with their day.
---
Just ignore the "BiS" part if it bothers you so much.
---
I thought it sent you to Duskshire and then the jungle place in your 20’s. Can’t remember everything from that long ago unfortunately.
---
Plenty of room for both in raids.  Locks are balls early on in raids dps wise but still useful for their utility, and scale to great heights in later patches dps wise.  Shaman can heal or dps in 5 mans while levelling, and even tank if you know what you are doing.  
---
yea, i want to know this too.
---
Is this a joke?
---
Wasn't reckoning capped to 5 stack at some point in vanilla? Like right after that guy killed Kazak 
---
Not at all really. Xp and rep were both boosted in TBC. 
---
Saw a video someone running the blizzcon demo on an old PC from 2006 and ran some tests. The new client actually performed better than OG vanilla and you should expect smooth 60 fps gameplay on even the cheapest computer
---
&gt; tremor totem
---
which requires 8 shamans in each group and also requires the shamans to all time the drop perfectly otherwise people are going to be running around for 2-3 seconds anyway while the next tremor tick occurs.
---
Not only will most raids not have 8 shamans, but some of them will mess up the timing no doubt.
---

There’s a lot of gratitude behind this upvote.

You need to put Wetlands in there as well because of the Elite quest chain that unlocks The Stockades quest.

Classic was not linear at all and you could basically endlessly follow quests, breadcrumbs, and class specific quests all over Azeroth and forget where you started.

Also no, the people you describe are like the 0.001% of vanilla players.

Preach said (on youtube/stream) that he had some plans to announce something he was doing in conjunction with blizzard on April 11th, but couldn't say anything until then due to an NDA. Could be classic related.

I’m in the same boat as you, Zooloph. I want to play druid or shaman. I did play druid in vanilla and I did tank and heal. I will say that I never had an issue finding groups for any 5 and 10 man dungeons. If you say you’re a tank, people will scoop you up quick.  I don’t think you’ll have to worry at all about that. 
---
It's easy to level cooking if you lvl a lot around different shores, all the mobs like murlocks/nagas or crabs drop crab/clam meat which is mostly what you need to lvl it up. If you are the Alliance it's usually extremely easy to get cooking to high lvls if you chose a darkshore zone to go through.
---
I have always played horde, but am going alliance this time. I want to main druid but it seems that there are quite a lot more druids on the alliance side due to people loving night elfs. I dont enjoy classes that are highly populated and like being the unusual class.
---
Np. The easy to find PDF's online is to append ":.pdf" to your search. So in this case, I searched "wow dungeon companion:.pdf"
---
Everything isn’t in the patch notes sadly. That reputation changed is a known fact though. If nothing else, proved by the fact that back in vanilla you saw precisely 0 people with different faction mounts before lvl 60. Absolutely 0. 
---
We'll see, then :V
---
Warlocks can kill players consistently in duels (don’t do it tho got a 24h ban for it). You just drag the duel near a fire like the kitchen in dusk wood and gear him at low health in the fire and finish with a shadow burn putting then at 1hp.   They kneel in the fire taking 5 damage and die.   (Shadow priest should be able to do the same).  
---
Druid’s can disengage from pvp by switching to sealfom.  And out swim all classses.   
---
So when opposition is nearby stay near open water.

Pushing for server first kills on bosses... You know, hardcore progression. Not a more casual guild.

Hey! Yeah, it will be released once it will be ready, currently, that's in early beta.

Overpower is calculated by avg(currently fight duration is set to 180sec, users will be able to change fight duration in future versions) dodge numbers minus avg. multi dodges(.
---
Swing reset is calculated by penalty, calculated by avg extra attacks rate.
---
Also, HS isn't capped by yet - it will be implemented in future versions with rotation and talent trees options.
---
Distracting dagger overtakes DS cause of lower speed(more Heroic Strikes) 
---
Well, we had them in our semi progression guild. It wasn‘t that narrow back in 2006 because most people didn‘t give a fuck on prescribed „best“ rosters for certain raids and situations. There wasn‘t this extreme mix maxing culture like today so many guilds tried their own tactics and the most important thing was the closed guild community having fun all together. Noone was sorted out because they wanted to try a different specc in the raid though most people knew that not every pally healer can respecc to retri because it would obviously kill our roster/progression so they decided to not do it for the guilds success.
---
Hopefully separated. Can’t imagine it would be any different. 
---
Its from a song...
---
No? It's the norm nowadays and I would love some skins or things like that.

Loot boxes with voice lines, skins and the like.

Everyone underestimates the power of the huge fuckoff beard.

Remember Darwin's Island?

I think someone was ganked by a Gnome Rogue at Nessingwary’s Camp again 😅
---
Nef is the bigger pain in the ass without fear ward imo. 
---
I agree but with some differences, I would prefer for example priests not be able to roll for daggers since they get a guaranteed huge upgrade from the staff so I like reasonable limits. If you swing it you get it, rogues taking a BiS ranged weapon while it is a primary weapon of hunters for example. Now say you have a Boomkin whos doing his best and wants to roll on shadowflame, well he isn't doing anything weird or cross-spec.
---
Duskwood is 20s then Stranglethorn Vale is in the 30s iirc.
---
This is a blatant lie.  
---
I am a casual player, and I do feel oppressed when hardcore players like you tell me which spec or gear selection works best. 
---
I’m in the same (but different) boat. I wanna play Horde but all my mates have turned from the true cause and fallen to the Alliance... as too must I 😩
---
 (5x(2\^(\[target\_LEVEL\]-\[attacker\_WEAPSKILL\]/5)-1))/100  for glancing blows dmg reduction.
---
That's all about of fast attack speed and Heroic Strike. 
---
1. The two factions aren't at war in the vanilla timeline. It boggles my mind that RPers, of all people, don't seem to get that.
---
2. What makes you think that the Orc Warrior 'Grok', killing scourge in the Eastern Plaguelands, wearing an Argent Dawn tabard is not a member of a neutral faction?
---
No problem... \^\^'

Hi, /u/Uninstalling_ATG
---
Not fallling into the pit of low FPS will be a fucking hodsend

Hi, I am not usualy answering or writing about anything when it comes to druids since I dont wanna spoil information and such, but I feel like I have to do my part a little so bare with me if the explanation is kinda shit. 
---
However, depending on your spec in a higher end raid lets say BWL gear altleast you are able to play Nature's Grace(NG) spec 21/0/30 which means everytime you crit on a heal you lower the cast by 0.5s on ur next heal. This way as healing with HT as a druid the most valuable heal is R4. Reason to this it that it scales almost 100% with ur improved Healing Power, 392-481 as base, but with 750HP for example every HT will hit 1.1k with only costing 177mana. R10 costs 768 mana, heals for 2041-2409 and will land aprox at 2850-3k. 
---
Pretty simple math in the sense that R4 use max healing for least mana = spammable in a whole diffrent way. 
---
The way you play this build is that you go for a little more crit and use a macro to spam R3 HT instead, but with every NG proc you go over to a R4 since it will pop of in the same time as a R3 that is 2s instead of 2.5. Which makes it the most efficient with the right gear to make you never go OOM, you might need to have Darkmoon Card Blue for example, but this is doable in BWL - ZG gear. 
---
Hope this helped a little to understanding how you think when you heal, this is ofc not the only way you have to go at it, we havent even touched NS or Regrowth but yeye. 
---
HMU if you wanna chat some more. I've atleast got some experience private server style as druid :) /// Finaltrash

There is no sense to discuss with you any longer. You are to pro to understand where I am coming from.

Yea, but getting slapped in the face 5 times by a slow af weapon is going to put you in the ground, or very close to it

I don't believe it's even close to possible at this stage. There's just too much work for them to do.

I'd expect reforged to come out at around November bring realistic.

It will be retail though

Just ask yourself, you want to shoot stuff big ass shadowy death or chain heal laser melee dumbys dieing to fire damage. Either way you'll find a raid spot.

This was my issue with it. I liked that I had a chance to check it out, but the place was a joke.

I don't think they've explicitly said no, but I'd have to imagine the answer is a no, outside of battlegroup matchmaking.

The thing you're talking about is Cross-realm grouping/Cross-realm zones. a

Sorry for trying to help by telling you what works best. I think it's in people's nature to want to help one another, especially if we see someone struggling

I think it's just to underline the typical immature "1v1 me scrub" kind of person.

He's a good player but with an obnoxious personality.

maybe a rough draft? like you should be heading to this zone after xyz zone?

All weapons are hunter weapons. All skills are hunter skills. Fear the hunter 😂

If you ignore Ironfoe and Teebus(good luck getting either of them), then thrash is the 2nd best MH weapon for rogues, right behind your Dal'rends.

---
Yes, Dalernds is better, but trying to get both of them(and you do want both of them) can be a huge pain in the ass, since half of every UBRS group will be other melee trying to these swords as well.
---
I spent a substantial amount of my /played time jumping around and trying to get ontop of things. You can bet your ass I got legion and mained DH solely for double jump. Can confirm was very hard to play anything else.
---
Christ.
---
In addition to what's been mentioned above, this also creates the possibility that a late-comer cant roll with friends due to cap. 
---
Wait, so you can be in cat or bear form but still look like a pirate? 
---
If he picks night elf he can min-max casualness though. 
---
In that case I’m happy to inform you you’re 1000% wrong. If it was a thing, it would have popped up on pservers. They attract the most elitist and obnoxious min/maxers you could possibly imagine and not even they use something so bereft of intelligence as gear score to measure players’ worth. 
---
The races aren't even min-maxed in the most hardcore guilds. It's just clowns like the user above who are trolling people time and time again.

Oh thanks for posting this, I wanted to give this a shot with my new beanbag and tv.  laziness 10/10.
---
People have no clue what they're talking about, but want to get those "technically correct" points
---
You can, but if you really want to succeed in wow, you need to play a NIght Elf Priest. It's synonymous with pooping on minmaxers chests, which is really what we all need to do.
---
Plus, would you rather fear ward in pvp and survive to run away like a little bitch, or starshard someone to fucking death and shadowmeld on their corpse?
---
Horde do have rage for both heroic strike and hamstring, another reason that the "100% accurate guaranteed also pls donate money" tool should actually calculate/sim out the rage instead of letting you pick it on a slider.
---
Fuck it - I'll role a druid
---
Might have been undertuned for some but my 16 year old ass on satellite internet and my loser guild definitely struggled with it even on 10 man. I was our best dps as a moonkin doing about 2k dps, we had an arms warrior and a DK who both did around 1200 dps (they would regularly get beaten by our pally tank). 
---
Then again I'm sure we were the minority. I started getting into pugs for the 25 man and we would have a pretty easy time full clearing (this was around the time ulduar came out).
---
Isn't the point of nature's grace to throw out low-rank regrowths with the increased crit chance and then proc natures grace, getting regrowths down to 1.3s cast times (with 5pc t2)
---
I may not be a warrior but I'm sure not a fucking Cleric either.
---
Using pvt servers as a guide are like a lamppost to a drunk. More for leaning on than illumination.  I think the grind behind the raid is  going to be the biggest limitation. 
---
We have more info and experience so i think mc/bwl/aq20/zg will all be relative exercises in getting used to classic again but i doubt as a serious raider you will struggle. 
---
I love how the guys have lcd screens but Kenny has a CRT monitor because he's poor. Great details. 
---
Even prot pallys have their purpose. I know that they are not even nearly as good as warriors and bears and still they fill a nichespot. I agree with you that i will be very hard to find a raidspot if you intend to play a prot pally and are not considering to respecc in any case
---
&gt; another reason that the "100% accurate guaranteed also pls donate money" tool should actually calculate/sim out the rage instead of letting you pick it on a slider.
---
Agreed. 
---
Keep in mind that while 60:40 may not seem that large, it is a 3:2 ratio. Meaning that there are 50% more of one faction (extremely imbalanced).
---
Thanks for not killing me while I waited to get in for tribute buffs that one time
---
I do feel people have a skewed view of how bad it will be here. I'm sure a lot of people saying "you have to roll this to get invited" wouldn't themselves care if they were leading a raid. 
---
Having my name on crafted items. Improves performance of said item by at least 120%.
---
Being second best doesn’t mean it’s close though. All it means is there aren’t a lot of great swords.
---
Most decent groups will give rogues priority on DR. The vast majority of dps warriors will be arms. If it’s a guild run then there should be no question. 
---
It will take months to reach Naxx, possibly a year or more. If you manage to get into a guild, they need to constantly do MC, ony, AQ, zg, world bosses, etc on a weekly basis... the guild will need tons of warlocks porting people all over and farming characters just to supply potions....and that is just to enter Naxx.
---
*fans you like James Brown after he finishes a set*
---
This post made my day. Thanks
---
Oh yeah I’m not taking *issue* with anything you say, and I agree. But my biggest takeaway is that, honestly, liking low level dungeons and mundane shit like that is most of what separates Vanilla from any other expansion. Myself, I more prefer BC, since that’s when I started raiding, and class flavor/balance was the best it would ever be. 
---
But part of the magic of Vanilla that you can’t binge on in any other iteration of WoWs lifespan is exactly that kind of thing. Doing Deadmines with some buddies you’ve leveled with for the past few days, getting those first few blue items that make your toon feel like a god. Aggroing 8 goblins in the Furnace room and wiping. 
---
Personally, I think BRD and BRS are the pinnacle of dungeon design, yet those are still fairly easy, skill-wise. 
---
With every thing 100% equal except for race raid leads will choose dwarf priests over human priests till bwl is farm status. But if you have better gear/ can prove you are just a more talented healer you can get a raid spot easily. It will just be harder to get one initially because the utility dwarf priests bring that you wont be. 
---
Shaman who converted to Druid here. Shaman are kind of a bummer in endgame unless you live in battlegrounds. You heal, heal, and heal some more. If you want to do other stuff in addition to healing (you know, like a hybrid), then Druid is better.
---
Shaman are insane in PvP though.
---
Classic is a small side project and ZERO access to Blizzard's primary marketing engine. It's their cheapest attempt to take over the Classic version of the IP from private servers and likely has no regular integration into Activision Blizzard's stock market investor engine.
---
Developers normally spend up to 50% or more of the entire budget of a game in order to promote it. Classic is on a shoe string budget, can't maximize it's cash shop model due to the game's culture and purpose, and no longer fits into Blizzard's modern advertising engine.
---
Social media, streamers and Youtubers will likely be where the focus is put as it helps build the community for a very social game.
---
Praise Hod 
---
? This is not even close to required to do naxx.
---
Nightmare procc 
---
People say Classic will be a cake walk but lose their mind at the idea of bringing anything other than a 100% min max raid.
---
Like is the game hard or not? 
---
You're asking the wrong question. I'm going to be lots of things. I'm an alt-aholic with no desire to seek treatment.  I am the many-faced nub. My will is eternal. 
---
If you have cleared stuff on wrath you should easily be able to clear in vanilla.
---
Obviously it depends on your guild and all that, but naxx is so far into the future you might not stick to whatever guild you join at first.

Show up for enough raids to be a primary healer.

Heal you noobs so I can get gear.

Blow people up in pvp.

Shaman life.

Yes - my friends.

Yes.  As I remember it you have to use it after shapeshifting, it wont remain through multiple transforms.  But you can be a pirate cat.
---
A moment for the fallen....
---
It won't be an issue
---
As is perception and shadowmeld. I would say Alliance racials individually are not top tier, but as a whole is better than the horde. But for some reason, 1v1 is the metric that too many players judge classes and races by.

If i recall right then my horde route was something like this (on warrior, always a level lower than mobs):
---
1-13 Durotar
---
13-16 Barrens (ragefire)
---
16-17 stonetalon 
---
17-20 Barrens (wc)
---
20-23 stonetalon
---
23-25 tarren mill
---
25-26 Ashenvale Beach
---
26-30 tarren mill/ Alterac
---
30-32 1k needles
---
32-33 shimmering flats
---
33-34 Desolace/dustwallow marsh north
---
33-36 stv north 
---
36-37 badlands
---
37-38 arathi 
---
38-40 stv South 
---
40-41 dustwallow marsh south 
---
40-42 swamp of sorrows
---
This is not even close to true. The threat difference is way more valuable than 1% dodge early game and if you had ever tanked in Vanilla you would know this. 
---
The threat difference stops mattering late game once you have enough hit gear/ good weapons. 
---
Try and fit in both where you can, but don't slow your leveling for either.
---
If your cooking gets too low level for your zone, just start banking (or bank alt) all cookable items and come back to it when you have time.
---
Fit your fishing in when your waiting for people or chatting.
---
It's fine for what you want to use it for, op. VanillaGuide is actually pretty decent. Take a look at zygors guide aswell. Odds are you are not getting ahead of the curve at launch unless you are literally awake for 35+ hours.
---
If someone had some new cutting edge guide and posted it on here, then it would be useless because everyone would be using it. Most people that are actually going to get ahead of the pack have personal routes made, or are currently testing them/working on them. I've talked to a few of the speedy bois and they will give some tips but won't give you their guide/route.
---
That being said, Joana is working on releasing his new guide, with which he leveled to 60 in under 4 days played with. Your best bet would be to take that guide or his old guide and tailor/tweak it, or find some other strat that will put you in places that are good for grinding mobs that are not on heavily traveled paths. Or figure out when to come back to zones at a higher level than intended.
---
Ports, farming, sustenance. Needed as well as high dps and CC. I'm leaning this way, myself. 
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **1st Cakeday** GreenchiliStudioz! ^(hug)
---
*laughs in dwarf paladin*
---
Bro please lol. You'll never encounter anyone who will be looking for dwarf
---
Yeah its a bit tough with the tick interval but it gets the job done 😊
---
Any glitches will likely be "new" to Classic as it's using an entirely different engine version. Newer players may even be more aware of what those may be than Classic/vanilla players.
---
Bruh NE priest is sick, shadowmeld and starshards are super useful things.
---
I would highly recommend a 16:9 monitor for WoW - those ultrawide monitors. This game wherever Classic or retail looks really nice on such screens. Nice "immersive" look :)
---
&gt; The vast majority of dps warriors will be arms.
---
what?? 
---
every warrior is going DW fury if they want to be anywhere near the top of the dps meters. 
---
The only warriors that will not want dal'rends are the ones crazy enough to farm out ironfoe. And in that case thrash blade becomes their BiS OH weapon BTW.
---
&gt; Being second best doesn’t mean it’s close though.
---
It's pretty fucking close, if you know what you're doing, you wont be far behind people with DRs.
---
Tell that to your raiding guildmates
---
Mind control cap someone, then feign death and watch the guards kill them
---
Nice try Hulu shill
---
No, tauren females are fine. They’re pure cinnamon buns too good for this world. 
---
Yeah perception can be very helpful in a pinch and shadowmeld is definitely extremely good
---
And of course sword skill, spirit buff on humans, and int on gnomes
---
I can honestly say this meme does not speak to me. Did people really give them money? I mean, obviously SOMEONE did, but did enough people do it to justify a meme?
---
The trick about Classic is that zones do not often have enough quests to level you through that zone alone. Best to research every zone as you WILL have levels where you struggle to find quests.
---
Alliance, although the faction that tends to have better scripted events and more fleshed out quest lines, does have a content gap in the mid levels perhaps worse than Horde. The trick with Alliance is researching their LONG quest chains so you miss none of them.
---
It's those very long quest chains for Alliance that helps those slow mid levels. Miss 1 or 2 of them and you can lose out on a ton of xp ... or often why power levelers just grind through those levels due to the amount of travel time required for those quest lines.
---
What glitch is this? When you’re late to the elevator and fall down?
---
Your best per point passive survivability talent is probably Deflection and that is in arms. The more active points in Improved Shieldblock and Last Stand are very powerful, they give you more control over your own survivability.
---
But the biggest reason people put points into the Prot tree is Defiance. A 15% threat increase is no joke.
---
Now with leveling your spec shouldn't ever be a problem for tanking dungeons. Just go at the appropriate level or maybe 1-2 levels above that you are 100% fine.
---
The dungeon difficulty is quite low up until about lvl 40. In my opinion the "true" leveling dungeons end with Scarlet Monastery. After that the dungeons get increasingly harder and longer. You'll get the first longish bossfights as well and trickier mechanics and you'll have to unlock certain bosses, areas or even the whole dungeon first. Up until this point you learned the basics, such as aggro control, pulling mob packs, when to use which move etc.
---
So when your Warrior is about mid level 40-50 you will have to start thinking about gear, talents etc. You wont be in a rush but you'll be steadily building up your tanking gear. And maybe you will actually enjoy tanking a lot and want to do primarily long quest chains, elite areas and dungeons with your friends? Then you can start considering putting some points into the prot tree to push your effectiveness as a tank. At this point you'll be the best judge of that.
---
Not sure if I should call it a glitch but casters being able to shoot through game objects / environment isn't really something I look forward to as a warrior :P 
---
Yeah, I really don't remember how the heck I managed that!  This was my first character on a new server, Bronzebeard EU, so it's not like I had any savings from previous alts.  Looking through some old pics today, I have one where she got her mount at 40 and I still had 20 gold left - I can see I had herbalism, I'm guessing skinning too.
---
In my opinion:
---
Ideal raid composition. (Alliance)
---
8 Warriors (2 tank / 6 DPS)
---
6 Rogues
---
6 Mages (Only 1 mage can get Ignite later on per mob)
---
6 Priests (5 Heal / 1 Shadow)
---
6 Warlocks (You do pretty insane damage later in Naxx)
---
4 Paladins (All healers)
---
2 Hunters (Tranq rotation can be sketchy with only 2)
---
2 Druids (All healers)
---
Paladins are a rare breed, so I suggest play anything except Hunter or Druid.
---
&gt; it gives away what you're looking at
---
.....you do know "target of target" is a thing, right?
---
No I agree threat is king it's just during progression it's not unreasonable for your dps to expect to hold back a bit anyway. Obviously for MC speed runs human is gonna be better. If your raid isn't super well optimized you can easily get away with a slight threat hit early game.
---
That is literally only one world buff. Misinformation.
---
2H is better early on. No one goes DW until the better gear from later raids is available. 
---
Yeah I dont think that was a joke, I also hope English isnt your first language.
---
It's actually the font that came with MirageUI - a font I was still using right up until Legion where for some reason it stopped working.
---
No, they wont.  There might be some vocal minority but most players on P servers are pretty chill. 
---

Looking for a competitive PvE guild with mature, reliable people
---
Inspired by the legendary Pat PvP 2 video, I started playing WoW a year into Vanilla as a Tauren warrior named Macbain on Agamaggan. This go around, I'd like to see what it was like to be Alliance (I'm going to miss windfury so bad though!).
---
Since I began so late and played so much PvP, I only managed to clear MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ 20 on live as an off tank/dps warrior before TBC. I was in college then as well so I had little time to dedicate to the game. Despite my casual attitude then, I played far more than I should have, just like everyone else did at the beginning of the game. After earning my Tabbard of the Protector, I've played every expansion off and on with a range of classes but tend to enjoy the OG tanking master, warrior, the most. I long to rekindle those ancient days of the true glory of the warrior once again.
---
Throughout the course of WoW, I've become a highly experienced tank and would like to find and journey with adventurers of similar talents. I'm never absent or late, I don't stand in the fire, and I know the importance of min/maxing as a tank in Vanilla. But I also know that the real thing that sets apart competitive guilds in wow is guildmates' dedication to one another.
---
Lately, I've been playing a little on unnamed realms to get back that nostalgic feeling and to remember how to play during that bygone era.
---
I'd like to find a group of people that I can journey with throughout the course of Classic from questing on up as I miss the feeling of comeraderie that was inherent to Vanilla. Drama is something I work very hard to keep out of my life so I'd prefer to spend time with mature folks, especially if I'm going to sink real time into this game again. Ultimately, I'd like to clear Naxx someday with my time investment, a good bunch of people, and a whole lot of loyalty.
---
I live by routine, work full time, and have an exercise regimen that I take very seriously but other than that I have few real commitments.
---
If you think we could be friends, just send me a pm here on reddit.
---
Cheers, and I hope we meet someday soon in Azeroth!
---
Damn my bad, it must have just been coincidence for me to see them every Friday. Hopefully we get one next week 
---
You can also taunt pets in gadgetzan. When they attack you the guards will kill the hunter
---
I mean, if wiping for months in MC is your idea of fun, go right ahead.
---
I'd love to roll troll but all their hairstyles are garbage
---
She’s probably a guy so...
---
Seriously. I'm admittedly a no-life NEET and I never played anywhere near "8 hours" every day.
---
It felt the same for me too but because I didn't know which day I went back and checked. I was hoping to pinpoint the day so I could look forward to it but it was too my dismay. 
---
It was a naive time back then, the dark ages—no Blender, no Source Filmmaker... mailbox dancing was all you had! 
---
Definitely.  Plenty of guilds managed to finish at least the first couple raids with druid DPS and healers, and not always even good ones.
---
I believe this is an attempt at humor. 
---
Yes, I know I am literally being pedantic.  That's the point I'm trying to make =[
---
What ever gets ya going
---
My goal is sulfuras hand of rag on my shaman. I will pug MC as many times as it takes 
---
Judging by that UI that has to be Kenpachi lol
---
I totally forgot 90% of my barrens chat experience was chuck Norris jokes
---
So true had a good laugh on this lol thanks
---
On private servers right now, Druids are pretty common while leveling, but few stick with it at 60. To really play a Druid at max level, you need three or four different sets of gear, not counting any resistance gear you might need as a tank. Your reward for keeping all of that gear enchanted and up-to-date is a role as an off-tank, "bleh" damage, and a secondary healer.
---
Warriors also have a pretty rough grind at max level, but they only need 2 sets of gear and they're rewarded with the top slot on the damage meters and potentially a job as the main tank. I think that's more appealing to more people.
---
You are looking at it from a private server view. Yes there are guides out there, BiS lists, all the info you need to complete the raids....but you are forgetting that 80% of the wow population don’t look for these and will not bother with them either. Even the people in this reddit are the minority, when classic launches there will be the majority of people that just want to play the game, they will never look up a guide or strategy on the Internet.
---
Then just like back in the day, 1 person will stand in front of the boss and try to explain the fight. Half will listen, half will zone out, then you have a bunch of wipes but eventually hopefully down the boss.
---
MC/ZG/AQ20 will be relatively easy to get your feet wet in, nobody will pug BWL unless you’re overgeared, and aq40/naxx is another ball game.
---
You can believe me or not, but you’ll see
---
Cruelty early. Sweeping strikes ASAP. Level 30 I think.
---
With luck you can get the 2h from rfk before 30. If you're not leveling too quickly to get an easy whirlwind axe instead. You want to use 2h all of leveling.
---
HoTs get really poor spell bonus, so at certain gear level you should just take them off your bars. They’re too inefficient compared with HT.
---
Elevators killed people for different reason during different patches.
---
Fall between seam between elevator and cliff/floor.
---
Latency makes you think you walked on the elevator, yet it started to go down. In UC the elevator went down at full speed faster than a character's fall speed ... hence you fall the entire distance to the bottom.
---
UC also just killed you for standing on the wrong spot of the elevator at times if you clipped the sides on the way down or you didn't start going down with the elevator and fall to follow for some reason (again the elevator drops faster than falling speed acceleration).
---
No matter the reason or variation, likely most died merely from trying to get on the elevator while it starts to drop ... so they dead. Not really a glitch, rather just poor elevator design.
---
i dont care about tanking or dps. I only want to heal and be support in pvp.
---
In 1.12 can a ret. pally still solo stuff like Strath? I have been seriously considering a pally over a hunter...I love to heal raids, but my first character was a hunter and I love being able to solo stuff. If ret pally can solo then I may be sold
---
Then you're a Druid.
---
Will we be able to play Classic with updated and advanced graphics? I really hope so. 
---
First of all: Are you really assuming that people aren't smart enough to figure out wether these methods save time or not?
---
The first sensible reaction to something you don't understand is to ask questions. It would have been so much easier for people to explain to you how the process works and why it saves time.
---
Like this:
---
A: "How does it actually save time to apply the Ony buff to everyone, when you first have to kill her?"
---
B: "Well the head is kept from the kill of the previous week up to this point, so the next round of farm raids can benefit from the buff. This way the buff doesn't get wasted but actually increases the farm speed of subsequent raids."
---
A: "Thank you very much for the explanation! Have a good day!"
---
B: "You're welcome and you too!"
---
World 7th best guild from what i remember i only got to raid with them as a social but Crizack,kenpachi,Broderick,dirkadwarf were all chill as fuck and cool dudes to raid/PvP with.
---
They don't give a fuck.
---
Much appreciated!!!
---
Prot Paladins have a fantastic purpose. They can Tank all 5 man dungeons in the game without problem and can AoE farm right from level 60 to make some decent cash. With the right spec they can comfortably continue to tank 5 mans, AoE farm, and heal in raids at the same time. What more do Paladins want, to be a competitive raid tank, dps, AND healer?
---
How delusional must you be to read that as "triggered"
---
Stupid comment my dude
---
"haha i got you so triggered with my comment!"
---
*proceeds to leave a literal fucking wall of text about how he's not raging*
---
Ahh, you're making me miss Classic man! 
---
You're misunderstanding my friend, I am not calling the min/max mentality toxic, I am calling the behavior of trying to dictate how others play the game toxoc. The animosity that Techtech is displaying isn't directed towards the entire group of people who want to min/max. He is instead angry about the people trying to say that min/maxing is the only way to play and that the game cannot be enjoyed casually as you won't be able to clear content/be accepted which is just false. No one here is trying to say that min/maxing isn't a valid or fun way to play the game, and I feel like you are feeling the exact same way we are just on the opposite spectrum where casual players are trying to tell you that because min/maxing isn't necessary it shouldn't be done. In reality both playstyles are equally viable and catered for in terms of guilds/groups of players so there should be no conflict here, the min/maxers can all stick together and shoot for the fastest/optimal clears through their use of mechanics while the casuals run around in their off-meta builds/race. The crux of the issue here is that one playstyle is not inherently better than the other, they are equally viable and can both lead to the player having fun and enjoying their WoW experience. This breaks down when one side begins telling the other that their way of playing the game is better. If you step back and look at this comment chain objectively you two are both frustrated with the same people, the elitist assholes pushing their opinions onto others. As for getting off my high horse well, I'm poor and haven't been able to get my mount yet, gib muny pls?
---
HOTW is fine for pvping. If you know you are going to be doing a LOT of WSG, then you might benefit from a more FC tailored build, but HOTW is more than ok for world pvp/casual bgs/ranking/pve. It's a good spec so that you don't have to respec every day.
---
[Here is the hotw spec.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxGgsc0zLVxsoxo)
---
[And here is a FC \(wsg flag carrying\) spec.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZxMuoZVxfoeq0o)
---
The title is a bit harsh though (do NOT buy...), you could have considered something like "Instead of buying a leveling guide, check this out". But you know its nothing serious though :)
---
At least in Spain you can still see cards like these in big shops and stuff, not that uncommon.
---
Then again, it is becoming more and more obsolete.
---
which one is better for world questing? 
---
Also, can i heal dungeons with the htow spec?
---
Arcane priest ftw
---
They're doing a pretty piss poor job of building hype as is.
---
You are not gonna be hard stuck in naxx without people looking up a guide for it, that just doesn't happen unless if you are in some really strict sadistic guild. 
---
Alenya and Umbra, two big speedrunners, have been working on a alliance leveling guide for 2 years now,  I think. It's set to release soon, and Joana is working on an alliance version too.  
---
I found Joana's guide to be less useful though, at least his old guide is definitely tuned for hunters, and not really doable playing other classes (I mean you can still follow the general guide, but it's definitely way less optimized).  
---
Zygor's has a TBC version that you could follow, but I'm not sure how optimized that is.  
---
I'd probably go with Alenya and Umbra's guide, theirs sounds like the best. They talk about it on the Countdown to Classic podcast, episode 98.
---
This was literally the first thread I came across after this one.
---
https://np.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b9uovj/can_i_play_as_a_human_priest/ek79q3t
---
World questing? Like leveling your character?
---
And you can 100% heal dungeons no problem at all with the HOTW spec. You can even heal raids no problem, with that spec. AND you can even tank dungeons no problem at all with that HOTW spec. All you need is the appropriate gear for whichever roll you want to do, that's it. Get a tank set, and healing set, and then... you're set!
---
This sums up how I feel as well.
---
You can still tank dungeons!
---
Are you ... me? :p
---
I too will be rolling every single class plus a bank alt or 2, and do not foresee myself ever hitting 60 on any of them :p
---
wait, did people actually give those guys gold?
---
not leveling, but making money  i guess at 60. you will have to excuse my ignorance, as I started in BC ,so i never have been at 60 for max level. I am not sure what people do to make money at end game. I assumed it was grinding mobs for mats or something like that.
---
Don't forget about the farming part at 60. As a resto shammy you'll have a much harder time farming mobs. You could always fish ofcourse.
---
Nice shit post. Don't come here again with this sort of crap. You stink. Stupid turd
---
Druids do have a pretty nice AoE heal. Only problem is the silly amount of threat it generates.
---
As an actual pvper, who did the grind as a druid, I'll copy/paste what I posted in a another thread;
---
&gt;You will be brain dead on WSG weeks, running the flag. This is the literal reason you get invited into the premade. You're meaning is to run the flag.
---
&gt;In AB, you will 100% be sitting at a base, defending, which honestly felt like a reward after wsg. SOMETIMES (if you can't break a shitter teams turtle at farm, then you get pulled to sit in bear form while you spam click the capture point, doing nothing else).
---
&gt;That is 100% what you will be doing if you plan on getting the "epic" pvp gear, at least 8hrs a day, 5 days a week. If you aren't good, which honestly being good at a druid requires some insane skill/knowledge/gamesense (probably more-so than the other classes, maybe not rogue), then you'll have a bad time getting the epic pvp gear. Because, there will only be 1 druid in a premade, and he has to carry the premade in WSG. So if you're not carrying your team in WSG, then you will get replaced, because the whole point of premades is to farm extremely efficient honor. Unless, ofc, you make your own premade, but then you have to hope the best players want to play with you.
---
&gt;It's much much easier to just get the raid gear. But honestly the bis items come from rank13 and exalted with BG factions, until aq/naxx, and even then some of the items remain bis.
---
&gt;Just go watch one of [Stormx's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci5IbZbscaA).
---
I’ll see your crazy and raise you insane:
---
I plan on doing the same thing on a different server with the opposite faction
---
AND having one toon (with one bank alt) on an RP-PvP server.
---
I just want to try and capture almost EVERYTHING WoW Classic has to offer 😅
---
Nah they will go to tbc. #SomeChanges when that does happen. They'd need a monumental success with vanilla to justify developing new content.
---
It's called a development cycle we are not, nor deserve to be privy too as well as this is not the only project being worked on in Irvine.
---
Hopefully we will hear more soon.
---
Back in the days of vanilla half of my friends used to play horde the other half alliance. I ended choosing alliance mostly because I wanted to play paladin. 
---
Now I refuse to level up a paladin ever again, and non of my friends in interested in classic so picking a side will be pretty tough.
---
My guild's MT for MC and BWL was a gnome warrior. That dude was awesome. 
---
I died lol. 
---
Enjoy those commercials 😈
---
Seriously? Ok unsubbing. 
---
Stop being such an asshole 💩
---
Ahh Impervious. I remember you guys! I switched from Whisperwind to Stormreaver during TBC and joined &lt;Out of Line&gt;
---
Honestly, my TLDR for people who ever have this conundrum is this: play what *class* appeals to you, and play the spec you want. In leveling and casual 60 play, any spec is useful as long as you do your job as your role. 
---
However... if you want to reliably be invited to raids, EXPECT to heal. There’s only 3 classes that can heal, per faction. But still, you need lots of healers in a 40m raid. Play the game you want, but the caveat is that other people can also play the way they want... by not inviting your boomkin ass when they can find dps easily, but would really use an extra Druid healer, for example.
---
I truly hate this stuff and hope our community has aged some.
---
We shall see
---
I'll be on 2 servers too, Ally and Horde - but won't have dupes I don't think, so probably 4 classes on each server plus bank alts, so only 10 overall - not as cray cray as you :)
---
It had denser ground foliage and actual dynamic shadows, if I remember correctly. 
---
Cooking is actually bis fot lvling speed with the exception of mage hunter, and will save quite a bit of gold. Especially if you get the lvl 35 food recipe in tanaris, unlimited lvl 35 food for 1s a pop
---
144 FPS doesn’t cause cool whine. You’d need 400+ for that.
---
No way to know for sure, but like I said, in the WSG files on the demo “pixel jumps” similar to the backdoor jump were still in the game while wall jumps were blocked
---
I feel like people that say this never actually played Vanilla. No one ever got canned from a raid for being the wrong race, lol. Maybe if you were in the top .01% going for world firsts? Never happened otherwise...Play what you want, if you're decent, you'll get into raids.
---
&gt;You are a watered down rouge, warrior AND caster.
---
Well, you can fluently switch between those things but at any given time, you can either be a watered down rogue, warrior OR a caster. And at any given time, there will be a class that is better at the job.
---
Still, if you're not minmaxing the fun out of this game, being a druid is nice since you can always fill the void. Guild wants to run a dungeon but there's no tank online? Don't worry guys, the druid is here. Lacking heals? Alright, let me put on my healing pants.
---
Yes Please!   
---
Coming from Defias Brotherhood EU -   
---
We had so many amazing RP-PVP events and storylines from Vanilla to WotLK that simply would not have happened on any other type of server. We had complete in character months long PvP campaigns. 
---
Some of the ones that stand out which I can find videos for:   
---
[The Battle for the Shimmering Flats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zU5bNXXh8)  
---
[The Siege of Theramore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kqu4R-1K18)  
---
There are countless of these accounts on youtube if you look deep enough.   
---
The RP'ers and PvPers worked together to really bring the server to life.   
---
If they want to recreate classic. I won't be classic for me without the RP-PVP server :( 
---
Nice la
---
Just play them all 
---
Once you get to level 10-20 , decide if you like it or not and go from there 
---
That way you’re not investing too much time and you’ll always want any Alt anyway 
---
My problem is trying to figure out what class to play, I have switched about 100 times since the classic announcement. 
---
This is from experience I completed all raids up to naxx on retail vanilla and multiple private servers.  The only time warlocks really beat mages is on fights where mages decurse non stop.
---
Stop describing me. 
---
It all depends on your guild. If you can maintain 40+ dedicated, skilled and geared raiders, including 8 tanks, you will be able to clear Naxx.
---
STV'Nam 
---
Yes but this only works if you were going to kill onyxia anyway. When you do it just for the buff it's a huge waste of time.
---
I've played in one of these guilds on private servers and the amount of time they required you to put in just in order to save 20 minutes of raid time was ridiculous. We're talking hours. As a healer I think I had to farm for almost 4 hours for consumables and world buffs for a trivial raid that took 2 hours at most.
---
In earlier raids Warlocks have a relatively weaker DPS output but they catch up to the top in the later AQ and Naxx raids, especially when supported by a Shadow Priest. A guild with a long term plan can absolutely bring 4-5 Warlocks in an optimized setup.
---
And it doesn't nearly matter as much in the easier raids anyways what you bring. A smooth gear progression is much more important at that stage in my opinion, so spreading out the classes is smarter than going for the most optimized dps setup, else you are going to have a big facepalm moment when you push into AQ+ and suddenly you realize you want more Warlocks and Mages.
---
You have a few options. Once you get decent gear you can farm specific bosses inside dungeons, like the rare mob in brd that drops fiery wep enchant formula. Or you can farm mobs in the world that drop things, like in WPL for Crusader Enchant formula.
---
You can stealth/jump run diremaul (especially lucrative if you or a buddy is mining). You can even sorta lasher farm in Diremaul, too (herbalism is highly suggested for this). You can do maraudon princess runs (soloable I think).
---
Skinning is decent, same with herbalism. Herbalism goes good with a druid.
---
If you plan on tanking, you might want to level enchanting to like 245(?), maybe 265 can't remember, so that you can craft your bis trinket. Then you COULD keep enchanting and try to make money with that, but it requires you to farm all the enchanting recipes, and then get lucky and get the recipes that drop in MC to actually make good money.
---
I made decent money with enchanting, but I was highly trusted on the server, and sorta had a monopoly on all of the Alliance pvp rankers and their guilds. Also put in a ton of gold/time to finally be able to make money with it, so idk if it was worth tbh.
---
TLDR: You can make money a multitude of different ways, it just depends on what you would enjoy the most.
---
I've seen them in EB games here in Aus as well, but we are upside down so we are slow at adapting.
---
If I remember correctly human was one of the races available to priests so yes it should be possible 
---
I fully agree people should be playing what they enjoy, as this is an MMO where you’ll be on your character for quite some time but I think it’s important to note that some people find their enjoyment simply from doing the biggest dps/healing possible.  
---
I’m not hard core I just play more than people work a full time job!
---
This is serious misinformation. If Blizzard leaves the class design as it was. You will not be able to raid as a shadow priest, ret paladin, melee shaman etc....
---
For most of Vanilla I was in a pretty average guild that managed to put MC and BWL on farm before AQ came out without ever using flasks. When Naxx came out it basically killed that guild and I ended up in one that flasked it up for every raid. Even then putting on full world buffs was only for special occasions like downing the boss we just figured out but needed a tad more dps for.
---
Adding to noise.  Were I not so busy, I’d highly consider doing an RP server.
---
At the char selection screen choose human and then select the priest class. Done. 
---
If you find this comment simple and annoying thats because its supposed to be. Stop with this shit. 
---
Priest gear just has more spirit on it than druid gear, so they will get more benefit. They also have more options for high throughput healing like Flash Heal and Prayer of Healing that make use of excess mana.
---
this is amazing, thank you!
---
No, you are a priest that can hold a shield, now buff me.
---
I'm very similar to how you are (primarily solo pve player who focuses on leveling) and just leveled both classes to 30, so maybe I can help.
---
Here's the key differences.
---
1. Warlocks are casters, 99% of druid are close combatants. Do you prefer to maul enemies up close, or do it from afar?
---
2. Warlocks have a stationary playstyle, you won't be moving a lot. Druid are the complete opposite, they're constantly on the move.
---
3. Druid have a lot easier time finding groups. While a Warlock certainly brings unique utility, they can't heal or tank. But conversely it's not expected of them - as a druid you have to be ready to perform 3 roles, which can be incredibly stressfull the first time. If you don't want to tank/heal, don't roll a druid.
---
4. Both have excellent PvE survivability. The Warlock can take on multiple mobs at once and has a spiffy self-ressurect, while druid can tailor themselves to the encounter and has stealth, which allows them to skip otherwise difficult battles.
---
5. Druids have less resource management, both in terms of mana and soul stones. You need acorns for the rez and that's it.
---
6. Both have strong class quests, but while the druids stop after level 16, Warlocks have a whole bunch through 1-60, making it a lot more fun lore-wise.
---
7. While warlocks have free mount, the druid has improved cat form and travel form, which shouldn't be underestimated. Especially as travel form can be cast in battle and you csn skin/gather herbs/loot without shifting out.
---
8. Exploration wise druid is better, thanks to stealth and multiple movement increasing abilities. Additionally each form provides different camera perspectives for screenshots.
---
9. Both classes potentially suffer visually. As a druid you'll spend 90% of your time as an animal, so you won't see your character or their fancy gear. Weapons are stat sticks and seldom used. Warlock on the other hand will be accompanied by a big ugly blue blob known as voidwalker 90% of their time.
---
Ultimately I prefer druid, mainly because of their versatility, better mobility and stealth. I also hated dealing with soul shards and I can't stand the look of voidwalkers.
---
Yeah the line of sight on that tunnel was buggy as fuck which lead to so many wipes. Eventually we were able to train people to hug the left edge because why chance it? 
---
Inb4 the bush is a naked orc.
---
&gt; This is not about hardcore min-maxing guilds, prot paladin is simply not viable for the vast majority of endgame content.
---
Prot paladins have tanked everything in the game. There is a big difference between not being viable and not being optimal.
---
&gt; Curse of Recklesness are also very usefull again mobs that "runs away in fear" when they get low HP. CoR prevents/cancels this effect on them.
---
this is nuts
---
No, beggers and naked dancing at mail boxes were 100% a thing. It's kind of like why "Homeless" begging is such a huge issue         
---
Time X $ =        
---
           
---
If I drive for Uber averaging 3 calls an hour and it's just some bar hopping yuppies I might make +$4 per call -0.50 for gas, $10.50 an hour sounds fairly impressive until I look on a street corner holding a humorous little cardboard sign getting $0.50 - $1 every 5 minutes. Hes making a little more than me, has no tax form, wear and tear or gas to worry about.             
---
              
---
Farming gold means, time walking there, possible ganking if on PVP server, dealing with others also farming nodes/mobs plus repair bills, food + bandages and any other mats you might use.         
---
        
---
OR         
---
Roll a Night Elf Female, Strip her butt naked and type /dance and collect from dip shits who either thinks it's funny or hard up freaks who dont know what Pornhub is.
---
Your first 30 points while levelling are going to be either 0/30/0 or 1/29/0. I can't imagine why you wouldn't just pick up leader of the pack at lvl 40. Get leader of the pack and then get natural weapons and then ooc, you're going to need all the extra dps you can get to grind 40- 60 and those talents are very strong. Going into resto at 40 just so you can get your ideal spec at lvl 60 doesn't make any sense at all. Just respec once you get there.
---
Most guilds will not even see naxx, why do people keep talking about it. The average classic playerbase is going to be 30-40yr olds with careers/wife’s/kids and a lot of things going on in their lives. We simply don’t have the time and commitment to make something like naxx achieveable, nobody wants to spend 3-4 weeks of casual time just farming materials and gold for 1 shot at naxx if the raid time lines up and everything’s perfect. The guilds that do naxx are the no lifers and tryhards, who already know the strategies and it makes no difference regardless.
---
Ashenvale, Duskwood, Wetlands, Southshore, Arathi, STV, Desolace , Badlads, Southern STV, Tanaris, Feralas, Hinterlands, Un Goro, WPL, EPL, Blasted Lands, Felwood, Winterspring... not exactly in that order since you'll be travelling around a lot but that's roughly the path I take as Alliance. Also there's dungeons thrown in.. DM, stockades, gnomer, RFK, SM, RFD, Uldaman, ST, BRD of course. 
---
Np man lol
---
Im just glad you brought something to the conversation... oh right no you didn't lol 
---
You're not worth the effort. 
---
Chill, that's just first beta. 
---
Swifty the night elf warrior and Faxmonkey the troll mage together shaped my young teenage music preferences. I can tell by what I listen to today that the roots of similarity hail back to these times. 
---
I know there are others if I took a moment to think, but these two are the standouts:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUPexEfCG7g&amp;t=771s
---
^^ Swifty, my most inspirational Ally
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5frS6BjaiD8&amp;t=250s
---
^^ Faxmonkey, my most inspirational Horde
---
Each of these two has several installations, i.e., "Swifty: Incredible Warrior Tricks 3", "Faxmonkey: Even Stupider Mage Tricks", etc., so if you don't dig the music or the skill in the two originals, it varies wildly in the future iterations of the videos.
---
I realize that what you *may* have been asking for were period pieces, especially those often featured in WoW videos, such as Drowning Pool's "Let the Bodies Hit the Floor" and "BOOM" by P.o.D., but this is an aside to all of that.
---
I knew a dancing nelf named Tipsonlypls
---
Lol, he says, as he spends effort.
---
again: RPS is calculated but not implemented until talent trees/rotation will be added. That's just first beta.
---
BM Hunter is really the only spec that jumps out as 'easier' compared to others, you will win most engagements levelling just with pressing cooldown and attack. That's only for a single spec that's good while levelling though. All the other classes are very similar. This meme that druid are ultra complex and hard to play is kinda silly. You have a lot of skills to keybind but so do warlocks/hunters/shamans as well, there's really nothing especially different about druid.
---
I doubt i'll ever step foot in Naxx, I love raiding but having fun is way more important to me, if the idea of a .2% damage increase is what drives you to log on everyday then thats not the guild for me. I truly hope i'm able to find a semi casual raiding guild that stays small and raids on weekends and doesnt bother with DPS charts but if not I guess I'll just become more PVP oriented and stick to dungeons. 
---
6 warlocks? Good luck with that.
---
&gt; I am the ~~senate!~~ Alliance!
---
This is a good one.
---
*I will grind gold for several hundred hours
---
Ftfy
---
Here's my rough take doing the same route you are planning:
---
Elywyn forest then start westfall hit lvl12ish. Get FP.
---
Loch modan 12-16(pretty much finish zone).
---
Redridge  16-17
---
Westfall 17-19, do DM when you are ready.
---
Finish redridge
---
Start duskwood until yellow/red quests
---
Then cycle between duskwood and wetlands finish up redridge if there something you missing. 
---
At around 26-28 do the elite Q's in wetlands and do stockades after, then do duskwood elites. This should hit you 30. Make sure you get the desolace prequest in Ironforge. At this point you can basically follow the vanillaguide addon if you can find that
---
I understand that, and I agree with the ahead of curve opinion. Just staying ahead of curve and reaching 60 in a reasonable time to be considered dedicated to guild is a concern. I’ll probably wait or stick to a guide because tailoring routes is such a time sink and I’m really not that knowledgeable when it comes to levelling. Thanks for the reply! 
---
All of a sudden you get hit with the /spit macro.
---
When the Paladin wants to main tank in raids.
---
Raid groups tend to have have at least one spot for an enhancement Shaman as a designated [Nightfall](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169) wielder.  
---
Oh 100%. But that's my end goal 
---
You can find the older ones still but we are talking $50+ per pack. The spectral tiger is worth serious cash now.
---
I've seen people doing this and I just don't get it. Powerleveling and grinding raids sounds like the least fun thing you could do in this game.
---
I've been Horde my whole life, since Vanilla. My friends all wanted to go Horde, but Alliance is more my style. I'm looking forward to going Alliance this time around, since they're no longer in it.
---
Yes, as long as you aren't trying to do stuff super undergeared (like if your tank is mostly in greens).
---
1. Falling through the map into the abyss
---
2. Getting 1 shot as a sheep, and rezzing in the bg with 1/1hp for the rest of the game
---
3. Various stuck in combat glitches, when a mob is evade bugged but you can’t reach it and you can’t mount or leave easily because of combat
---
Also tfw you crushed dozens of rogues that missed a stun or pallies that missed a hoj 
---
&gt; have been retaliatorly ganked
---
Can confirm as an alliance member; SGE were definitely kill on sight, or run away as fast as you can (if you were a pussy like me) 
---
This is how im going to play classic now too. 
---
I personally find druid tanking extremely dull compare to a warrior. 
---
You can't heal and feral dps in the one spec. Feral dps to be any sort of "ok" absolutely all the dps talents in all 3 trees. When people say resto feral hybrid they mean tanking/resto or feral pvp (which is really just a tanky mobile healer).
---
Ret Paladins are cringe.
---
I'm sure the Horde will feel similar in Ashenvale.
---
&gt; but they only need 2 sets of gear
---
Oh how wrong you are. 
---
Ok now were talking. Your first comments were so easy to misunderstand.
---
I have to agree with you there on the Ony kill. If you don't actually want to farm her you shouldn't kill her just for the buff *obviously*.
---
Also with the consumables. During farm raids. I had a pretty long discussion with an officer of a hardcore raiding guild a while ago. They were forcing people to show up with flasks on every raid, even farm raids. He couldn't give me the the answer to the most simple question: Does the time gained from clearing the raid faster due to flasks actually make up for the time/gold spend on them? He first went mad, but then it became clear he didn't actually have an answer to that.
---
I personally always juiced up as much as I could reasonably afford for raids that were still tough to clear and was always stocked with potions. That was because I simply wanted to put in the effort and play *well*. But forcing people to spend over a hundred gold on farm raids just seems a bit, counterintuitive? I haven't played enough on pservers yet to really understand wether that is just culture/meta stuff nobody really thinks about or if it actually makes sense in terms of time and money spent.
---
Sadly doesn't seem so... still ignorant hate for the ret paladin even with facts before them that show they can be just as good. 
---
Examples Pudgey and Esfand, and many others. 
---
Is this like legit? This is so perfect 
---
Only enough to get you to keep leaving comments as terrible as that one was
---
Warrior, holy priest, resto shaman, warlocks, and mages.
---
This argument is pretty funny to read in retrospect. Your context awareness and his stubbornness to accept that you knew what you were saying, even if the context was wrong...
---
Unfortunately it's one of those situations where both sides lose as long as they aren't really listening to each other.
---
