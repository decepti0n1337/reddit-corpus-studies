---
---
Same. I read regularly. Gotta keep that speed up! 
---
The hard core min maxers will be in the minority. There will be far more casual players who never played vanilla. I can’t wait to teach them how to play in vanilla 
---
Yeah in premades firenova, stun, Ele Mastery CL, Shock and they all pretty much hit at the same time. You explode someone on demand. Nswiftness is better for solo, but you can do a similar combo with a NSwift lightning at the end or including a grenade in there. It has gaps though and no dmg is guaranteed. Need the Nswfitness heal to beat or have a chance vs good rogues and mages though. 
---
Tauren actually opens up ele mastery as being "ok" in world pvp though because you can stomp nade big heal or stomp lesser heal wave. Totally agree though. Tauren is gamebreaking. If you aren't going cow you are doing it wrong or being carried by a premade where racial means nothing against bad players. 
---
I’ve never heard of those other games.
---
&gt;If you've gone this high in Arms you can easily spare the 3 points to get Anger Management
---
There is a big difference between 10 points in arms and 14 points in arms. Where are you pulling the other 4 points from?
---
without sharding and on a 5k pop server the average kill per player in Valley of trials (orc/troll starting zone will be 1 kill per 20 mins) XD
---
So that's not quite lvl 5.
---
This is even counting in people leaving starting zone etc :D
---
Lmao, inside the starting zone? You played a bit to much on private servers, on private servers it was 5 seconds per mob, in retail its 5 mins per spawn, so closer to 50 hours. Btw i calculated how long it would take previously for this, it will take 20 mins for the average guy to tag 1 mob if 900 people are inside the starting zone (I assumed 100 people leave to explore or to group with friends to kil lvl 5's outside) 
---
Also it would be even worse when mob timer is 5 mins, warriors will never get tags while rogues will get all, people will also misstime etc.
---
The only real way to lvl is explore if they decided to not have sharding on a 5k pop server
---
Horde EU pleb here that would like to tank
---
[removed]
---
Maybe I'm missing the point, but why are you posting about theoretical post-vanilla lore in a sub dedicated to revisiting vanilla precisely how it used to be?
---
&gt; I get this game is really for the hard-core old timers who played back in the day and have run the content 1000's of times.
---
First of all, no. Even as a hardcore player myself I strongly disagree. Vanilla was welcoming to all player types. The game required more attention and dedication than other games for sure, but that is a symptom of the times, not the intention of the game. We live in a gaming era now where working hard for the things you want is not entirely necessary. You can just buy it with real money most of the time.  
---
 
---
&gt; But how accessible will it be for new players or players that have joined in later expansions but want to experience the  
---
&gt;vanilla levelling  
---
The reason why this game is just as friendly to new players, is because leveling actually makes up a lot more of the game than it does in retail. In retail you can get to max level in a couple days being lazy. In vanilla, the experience makes up roughly a month of your playing time, far longer if you are adventuring and don't already know your route. I find that the game was the most enjoyable to me as a new player before I even hit 60.  
---
&gt; questing  
---
Same deal. You could "discover" quests out in the world that you never knew were there. I played WoW from the launch of vanilla to the end of Wrath, and the entire time I played, I never knew there was an escort quest in Teldrassil where you escort a panther back to it's owner. I never knew. I also never knew of the One Shot, One Kill escort quest in Darkshore. I never knew about Old Serakiss boss in Blackfathom Deeps. How did I not know all that time? I have no idea. I only discovered them on private servers when people mentioned them.  
---
&gt; progression?  
---
This is admittedly more difficult, but it primarily depends on how much time you have to play each day, rather than how new you are as a player.  
---
At the end of the day, the ultimate question is not how "new" you are as a player, but how dedicated you are.  
---
If you want to succeed and are willing to put in the work, you will succeed. I think the most helpful thing is going to be making friends who know the game, and admitting to them straight away that you're a new player who is trying to learn. If you approached me in game randomly and said that, I would tell you that you can ask me anything you want to know, and I'll either tell you outright, or find the information if I don't know it.  
---
We were slow learners when vanilla was first launched, because nobody knew anything. Now we have so many knowledgeable people, that you can quickly catch up to the level of knowledge that is considered standard among hardcore players. The only factor is how dedicated you are to catching up to that point.  
---
Even as a hardcore player from before, I still spend every day on my personal private realm testing out ideas and turning unknowns into knowledge.  
---
You can catch up.  
---
Depends on your class. Hunter is pretty much AFK status and you could be in the kitchen cooking up a 20-person feast without losing efficiency.
---
That makes sense. Thank you for the reply.
---
It's hard to say. Every dungeon requires a healer and a tank, but those classes often come as a package deal. If you're a solo healer then you are relying on finding solo tanks. It can be quite frustrating healing random tanks, as many of them are quite bad. I would be wary of going full heal unless I had a dedicated tank.
---
Unless you already know class officers, are one, or are doing the rank 14 grind, then the primary concern on a warrior should be PVE racial to secure that dps spot. You have two choices. Orc or Human. Human will make sure you do dominant big d@%% damage early with Dal'rends. Orc is less important early on, but you don't want to give people any excuse not to take you and orc is best at PvP anyways. 
---
In TBC you have arena. You can easily get gear fast. Gnome racial is also instant cast there. Gnome is a lot better then. Vanilla is not TBC. **Vanilla on a warrior = gear is all that matters. The class actually plays different due to gear because of how rage works in Vanilla.**
---
Alliance is easier to group pvp with because Holy Paladins with decursive are simply broken. Is decursive going to work in Classic? No one knows. That also doesn't really matter if you are ranking because premades are going to clownstomp non premades anyways. 
---
**Everyone wants to be a dps warrior in patch 1.12.** If you don't know the content, aren't leading it., you should be watching DPS guides, getting BIS farming guides together, tank guides (fastest way to get your dps gear as you can form groups with all caster dps to get dal'rends and or reserve them) if not doing the rank 14 grind. Flip a coin for the racial or choose what looks you like more. Human or Orc.  If going rank 14. Roll whatever you want. You could be a freakin Night Elf and if you know how to play, you are going to succeed. What's the best for 1 v 1? Gnome or Orc. You could argue Dwarf too, but you already kind of dumpster rogues as a warrior. Sitting in a nova about to take a huge shatter combo is the primary concern. 
---
Let me just tell you now, that you're wrong about most people doing the content in their sleep.  
---
People largely agree that private servers have the more hardcore fanbase, which is why you hear "private server tryhards"  
---
Let me tell you though, I've been in groups on private servers where I could have pulled my hair out. I can assure you there are other people out there who screw things up.  
---
The thing about them is that they weren't willing to listen. At all. They were completely unworkable to the point of some people leaving the group.  
---
You could be the difference. When you make a mistake, learn from it. That's how the best players became the best.  
---
Mind you, doing it as 5 took basically forever, and you need basically the best gear in the game.

I'll usually have reddit or a movie/show open on my 2nd screen while playing.
---
My plan is to have a second account and play both on each monitor. One can manage my auctions and do a profession while I lvl the other
---
I can't imagine Siv would see these comments but if he does: Work on not talking over people, your comments and opinions are solid and worth the time, but just wait a second and give other people priority more often.
---
I saw this ring drop 2 times in UBRS on private servers
---
one of those times a hunter needed it over a priest because "the shield could be good in PvP"
---
Yes. But you need the five points somewhere in the fury tree to go deeper. 
---
Not removed, just entirely irrelevant to everyone but arcane mages and healers
---
Fordragon the real MVP tho.
---
&gt;The specs doesn't really matter much as long as the players are good enough and most of them are not.
---
This is empirically incorrect. Spec matters. Big time.
---
&gt; Take a mid-level guild and form a 100% optimal raid setup and they still won't get far into AQ40. 
---
Incorrect again... This is a huge generalization. With the appropriate leadership and understanding of the content, they will breeze through it after a few dry runs, assuming they are appropriately geared.
---
&gt; Take a top-level guild and stack it full of meme specs and they could probably clear AQ40 
---
Incorrect. A top level guild isnt smashing through AQ40 FULL of meme specs. They will not clear with a full meme comp. 
---
&gt; The hunter sucks in PvE post BWL, that's just a fact. An unfortunate fact. 
---
Well you've certainly changed your tune. Originally you said "Hunters are actually really bad in vanilla". I guess you have accepted they are great in world pvp, arguably have the highest value ability in group pvp, are top tier for 1v1 in pvp, are THE TOP DPS for tiers 1/2 during progression, are the most efficient levelers, have the best solo pve capacity and are among the top gold farmers... So now your only contention with hunters is during late game Naxx pve progression? Hahahahaha. I think most hunters will trade unparalleled dominance in EVERY facet of the game, to be lackluster in late game Naxx content.
---
Sharding doesn't fix anything if there are enough players all trying to rush. If you shard the starting zones, it just means that you're dumping a massive load of players into the next zone and there's a glut there. 
---
Most people will continue playing well past the starting zone, so you're only kicking the can down the road with sharding. 
---
It's the only one with any significant population.  Retro Wow.  All raid content tuned to be 5-man'd, everything 1.12, can equip yourself in preraid BIS at the start and then earn gold in a variety of ways.  Pretty fun, maybe 500 people or so at peak times. 
---
I guess you can’t see 20’ in front of you?
---
Over all you seem way more knowledgeable then me but, you are forgetting Nightfall.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169
---
Can you tell me where it fits in the pecking order?
---
Depends on class yes. The best weapons are from kel’thuzad so yes pve. If you’re a serious pvper classic is a lot of fun, and putting together a great pvp set will require all aspects of the game and feels like a true accomplishment.
---
A big factor in pvp in vanilla are engineering gadgets, trinkets (lots of them. Fill your bag and swap accordingly) and consumables.
---
Look up some “bis” gear sets for classic pvp, they can be a LOT of work but pretty impressive. Bis is subjective to how you like to play. I recall a hunter showing off his “bis” set a mix of raid and pvp gear. I believe he was using flask of the titans too but he had freakin 6k hp and the crossbow from BWL. Deadly.
---
The Princess is the only Girl in a fucking Bikini in these pictures. 
---
That was from Omen of Clarity which was a talent in the Balance tree. So if you a boomkin that picked that up, you could melee chicken to get free casts. Granted it wouldn't be a good strat.
---
7.
---
I had the same line of thinking that you did, and then I mentioned that to someone else and they said "so just take it off and put another ring on during the cooldown lol"  
---
and then I stayed quiet.  
---
May I ask how the group responded when you obtained this ring on your mage?  
---
I guess you can't read the subreddit that you're posting in?
---
Thunderfury takes up 2
---
&gt;You say that the game is not only a nostalgia run because of features
---
1. I didn't say that
---
2. I guess you need to read the definition of nostalgia
---
&gt;You say classic is new game plus, but then you say the game is missing precisely what would qualify it as new game plus.
---
I didn't say that.
---
&gt; 1) You are excusing mods not cleaning it up, which should have happened immediately and was never done
---
Clean what up? Nothing posted in that thread broke any rules or was actually abusive towards the OP, it was just retail players providing their opinions which is **not** something Blizzard mods should be removing.
---
&gt; 2) Mods have banned people like Gummy52 for posts on things like spell batching and then lied about it on the forums or in public
---
No one was banned for posting about spellbatching (Seriously why would they? Spell batching has been discussed to death across the forums and nothing has ever been censored, furthermore spellbatching isn’t against rules either). Gummy was banned because he was accidentally unbanned. Gummy said he was banned unfairly, Blizzard says he wasn't. There has been no history of Blizzard mods banning people randomly or unfairly over the forums.
---
&gt; 3) Brian Birmingham has nothing to do with the forums, seems like a good guy and is NOT the lead. Ion is apparently in charge of decisions
---
I’m not sure why you’re mentioning the forums, you were discussing who the lead is. There was an interview with the leads of the game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAKvIx6eQpA) Brian Brimingham who is the Lead software Engineer on Classic and Jon Hight who is  the executive producer of WoW which appears to include Classic. Ion is the Game Director of World of Warcraft which, similar to Jon, appears to also include Classic. You’re trying to make it sound like we don’t know who any of the leaders of Classic are when we in fact do.
---
&gt; 4) He also blatantly misrepresented and or lied when claiming 16 debuffs was the way raids were throughout vanilla, when he 100 percent knows that isn't the case because he was a hardcore raider/officer and a healer who would be organizing groups around those 8 debuffs in early tiers.
---
Where did he say that? It makes no sense for him to say that on purpose as he’d get railed over it like Brack did by saying UBRS was 5 man at some point. Furthermore it was 14 years ago, people forget. I was a hardcore raider back in Vanilla and I’ve forgotten things. It’s not some grand conspiracy to manipulate or lie to the community, if he did say that it was more than likely that he just misspoke but I don’t remember anywhere that he actually said all raids had 16 debuff slots (especially since the community loves grilling Blizzard over a simple misspoken fact about the game)
---
&gt; The vanilla community has already abandoned the official forums for a reason. Blizzard abandoned us.
---
No the Vanilla community hasn’t abandoned the official forums, myself and others are part of both communities. Blizzard also hasn’t abandoned us, I’m not sure why you would think that, in fact just recently Ythisens has started to become a little active in the official forums and he’s always been periodically active in this subreddits discord. He actually engages with people there (I myself have had a few short conversations with him) when he’s in a talkative mood. No real feedback on that forum? There’s just as much there as there is here, this one just seems to be overloaded with memes since every topic has already been discussed to death. I’m not even sure what point you’re trying to do it with are just wrong.
---
Yes.
---
Yep
---
No they really don't. Players' ability to not fuck up and wipe the raid matters. So many of vanilla raid mechanics single out one person and see if they are able to move out of the raid or be dispelled or healed enough to not get one-shot. If 40 people can handle that then the encounter is trivial, if they can't then it'll be tremendously difficult. What you call appropriate leadership and understanding of the content is actually quite rare. Good raidleaders are hard to come by and getting 40 people to keep their focus and not randomly AFK in the middle of a raid is harder than you think. 
---
As for hunters they pretty much only do well in MC content. Look at Legacyplayers for a certain private server that shall not be named but rhymes with Borthwale and you'll see very few hunters even in the top 15s. Maybe you as a hunter expert can explain why hunters do a lot better in MC than BWL when the gear is the same? Honest question. So yes, the hunter is great at leveling, very nice in premades and PvP in general although as a warlock I find them the easiest to kill. Gold farming I don't know, I make my gold through professions and the AH instead of farming. 
---
Maybe improved shadow bolt instead of corruption.
---
Obviously paly is more group friendly, but levelling will be fine mage/rogue too. Mainly depends if you want to dps or not at 60.
---
It's pretty clear from your analysis that you understand both classes well and are comfortable playing both. Duoing in any combination will be easy enough. So at this point you're best off flipping a coin and going with the one your heart was always going to pick.
---
^^^^^it's shaman
---
For me personally, it’s nice knowing that everyone else is seeing my character the way I designed it. The faces on the new models for some races are so starkly different.
---
If Blizz commits to tweaking the new models to mimic the old ones as closely as possible, I’d welcome a toggle. The new models should be as exact HD remaster as possible, cutting out the creative freedoms taken with what we have on retail.
---
the healers put him on ignore lmao
---
This drops off the last boss of LBRS.
---
Why aren't my shamans on top of those freedoms and bops with purge and earth shocking that paladin? where's my WF totem so that when I actually close on someone I just delete them? it's not that one sided :)
---
&gt; The official first day of summer is the summer solstice. 
---
There is no "official" first day of summer. There are lots of different definitions of summer, one of them being what you are talking about. 
---
&gt;Classic WOW is not only a nostalgia run, but also has the old mechanics, old classes, old quests, etc, 
---
1. yes you did
---
&gt;This will be our NEW GAME PLUS experience. Even though we don't keep our old characters, we keep what we learned during that time
---
2. yes you did
---
Anduin vs Anduin?
---
not like it drastically effects major parts of the game...oh wait
---
Shame on you for even considering cleric. You still have time, so repent. Do some self reflecting. If you have to, roll be an edgelors rogue. As long as you don’t turn into a filthy cleric, you still have hope.
---
Ive read the quest text back in vanilla, don't need to do it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again
---
"If you want to just raid casually and **maybe** clear content? Play whatever you like."
---
Fixed that for you. Only saying maybe because guilds that allow sub-optimal specs will struggle to maintain players who do have the real specs and care about progression. There will be a constant stream of raiders coming and going which will make organization difficult which will result in raids being that much more difficult to clear.
---
WTF Y DOWNvOTE
---
1) Again there is no real discussion on those forums any any real discussion is brigaded and attacked and sidelined. More trolls engage on the forums and people who only play the modern game then people who are really interested in Classic.  Troll posts are also imported from General while posts critical of modern WoW are removed. Blatant bias and an agenda.
---
2) That is a lie. He was banned unfairly. The community manager Ythisens who you claim is "interacting with the community" is who lied about Gummy. Gummy then provided proof he was unfairly banned, that Ysithens lied about fabricated death threats and that other employees at Blizzard unbanned him because it was all made up. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHUUU_P0bjo&amp;t=11s
---
Ythisens was not punished for this, which is frankly a joke. Gummy is as important to us getting Classsic as Nost and more than Classicast, yet those people are seen as leaders of the community and heroes, while Gummy was slandered all because he asked VALID questions or gave VALID criticisms and concerns on the official forum. Classic was announced after they shut down Felmyst. Not Nostalrius. People like StaysafeTV used to laud Gummy and do videos on him and Felmyst, yet no one came to his defense when the community manager slandered him, which was very sad to see, especially since Gummy has extreme health problems. I lost a lot of respect for Classicast after this.
---
3) Ion is the other guys boss. They make ZERO decisions. Ion does, which is a complete conflict of interest. Anything you say past that doesn't matter. Ion should in no way be the lead on something that can cost him his job, if it does better than his current product. It's lunacy that Ion is in charge here.
---
4) Ion omitted 8 debuffs on some tiers. That is a lie by omission. It was complete manipulation and something he does often.
---
Now I'm done talking to you. You are spreading misinformation about Gummy and promoting and defending a known liar and slanderer.
---
Same but I still enjoy it. When you go up and talk to someone in RL, you can't click 'x1.75 speed', as much as you would want to. It isn't *that* slow and gives me a little more immersion. Else I read it *waaaay* too fast and it doesn't have the same meaning.
---
Gtfo Alliance scum.
---
Sounds fucking retarded. I can literally see zero point in doing that.
---
Because they said “summer” the assumption is between June 1st to August 31 but no guarantee 
---
Summer deinitely means july or august. It makes a lot of sense marketing-wise
---
Personally I prefer LAPping while I FAP. Seriously though these abbreviations are weird to read sometimes 
---
Spider Belt is a thing, too. 
---
A fucking men dude.
---
The current **speculation** is [July 16th](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/).
---
I see this misspelling so much I had to back out of the link, read your comment, then read OP's comment before I realized what was going on.
---
Most of the min maxers have been playing pservers with 1x rates, they know exactly the leveling experience they are signing up for.
---
As a Paladin you'd have to roll Alliance.
---
So the choice should be pretty clear.
---
Play what you want. Guilds will have a hard enough time gathering 40 people to raid anyway ;)
---
This.  Chances are very high that after launch, once the dust has settled, the core community for Classic is going to be (relatively) small.  I can guarentee that unless you're in a hardcore raid guild (in which case, you're going to be min/maxing), the guild you're with is going to be happy if they can just get 40 people together at once.  We're likely going to see some weird raid comps on the more casual guilds.   Raid leaders aren't going to have the luxury to pick and choose.
---
Ah an Alex fanboy, that explains everything.
---
Onyxia
---
So accurate 
---
Or once you hit 60, re-roll something new.  Who knows, maybe by that point you'll have a good idea of what it is you want out of the game.
---
You can stand in fire in modern wow?
---
Seconding this. For some reason people seem to hate people who are actually passionate about classic.
---
False. It was simply the only place Gummy could go to call out that the Community manager lied, show evidence that he lied since Blizzard is a powerful company and they have the legal right to ban anyone for any reason. You want to ignore evidence because of the channel it's on to defend someone that did something ILLEGAL (defamation of character) all to remove anything critical of Classic on the forum.
---
That makes you a horrible human being as well. I am a fanboy of no channel, except maybe Red Letter Media...
---
Shadow is the only legit way to deal damage in PvP. Healing in PvP is kinda boring IMO as a priest but that’s because I know how strong you can become as shadow. That said, heals can turn the tide in a battleground easily and a shadow priest can always switch out of shadow and throw some flash heals in at critical moments. Just carry mana pots 😉
---
You’re probably socially retarded
---
I remember writing my first ever Macro that cast Judgement of Righteousness and then recast Seal. I spent like an hour just getting it right, then tested it on the kobolds in Northshire for awhile. Eventually I added some super corny "/s" line to it for RP purposes.
---
Leveling paladin is super easy, you can chain mobs all day.
---
You've removed all doubt.
---
Here in the Southern Hemisphere it is summer 2019. Where’s my game Blizz?!?!
---
"Summer" could technically mean up until mid September. Expect the worst and you can never be disappointed.
---
Go play a lock on a pserver. See if you can deal with soulshards.. might be a deal breaker imo
---
lol the only thing that video showed was Gummy's excuse and pandering after he got banned. He showed one tiny clipped section of a Blizzard subscription list which could have been taken from anywhere and one message from a GM who could have simply made a mistake or been incompetent when reviewing the ticket and of course it's from an Alex video who's a narcissistic shithead who loves talking shit about Blizzard and thrives on Drama. That video was not proof that Gummy was "unfairly banned" and to think it would have been over a highly discussed community topic on top of it all is just ridiculous. Although from all your other points I can see why you'd believe that too. Besides, I thought you were done talking to me
---
&gt; but, you are forgetting Nightfall.
---
is he tho?
---
Druid can let you tank, dps and heal. Worth considering 
---
audio books man 
---
Well in retail you can pretty much play any spec you desire because they're mostly viable.
---
&gt;what group of 5 would be able to raid the most?
---
Whatever the other 35 people need most?
---
I'll give some more input as I get the time. But your feral list is a little off. 
---
Feral is actually one of the strongest 1v1 specs out there in vanilla. The ability to kite/heal/DPS at range and melee makes them a real pain in the butt. 
---
Warlocks tend to be one of the harder classes for a feral to beat, ele can def be annoying too. Most others are in ferals favor, a good rogue can be hard too. 
---
 Based on the people that I’ve met in LFG... yeah. 
---
Had it on my holy priest and I could barely ever get it to stay up during raids, there's a lot of random damage that's sometimes very hard to avoid.  That being said you can equip a different ring while it's down (and you're out of combat) but when it's up, the MP5 is noticable and very nice.
---
The GM would have had access to "death threats" the Community manager claimed. The GM found no such violations and removed the ban. When Gummy went public with that he was banned again. You can't remove any ban without having access to the violations.
---
The claims you are making are absurd. I can only imagine you are either an employee of the company or a shareholder at this point. Either way you are laughable. I suggest selling stock at around the 8 month mark into classic btw. The company will see a resurgence but the wheels will fall off due to all the changes around there. It will really fall off at 6, but for a couple months people will try BFA, see that it's awful and then the last old community Blizzard had left after they alienated the Diablo and Starcraft audiences will be gone.
---
That leaves the Overwatch audience made up of delusional, mentally ill loners who think they are potential "athletes". They will not have employment (ever) and it's not sustainable. Their mom's will simply stop paying for things. 
---
Tl;dr: orc racial is probably best in vanilla but does get nerfed after vanilla, if you think you might transfer to BC if that’s a later option, that’s worth considering. War stomp is under rated, especially for shamans, who have no other stuns and get off some clutch spells. Plus is fun.
---
I played a Tauren shaman in vanilla but only barely hit 60 before bc and was a nub. However played him a lot in bc and wotlk, including gladiator in wotlk (and rank one in battlegroup for first couple weeks next season, then I quit). I had one other main, an undead warlock, and many alts.
---
People say orc racial is strongest in vanilla. 25% stun resistance is insane. I usually minmax for racials, and would roll orc for most classes, including rerolling my main warlock orc instead of undead and sacrificing nostalgia. My shaman is the one class I would not be able to do this with, as I got so used to relying on war stomp, I would feel crippled without it-it really shines for shamans, who have no other stuns. However, my experience is based off of later versions of the game, mostly wotlk is where I was serious about my shaman. There, I got gladiator and was rank 1 for a bit. I dueled all the other top shamans on my server ele vs ele, and never lost once. War stomp I felt was clutch for this. Thing is, it’s #1 use for me warstomp&gt;hex, which doesn’t exist in vanilla.
---
The stuff I described doesn’t matter as much in vanilla though-stun resist is still 25%, and is super good in battlegrounds. So that’s best for min maxing, probably. War stomp interrupt into a CL or heal is still pretty good and fun, though. Worth noting I also didn’t have to deal with taurens bigger hit box as much as that was removed for wotlk, which will hurt you if you are resto or ele (but help if you are enhance) 
---
I stopped playing retail around the end of Tomb of Sargeras, but I remember being surprised that campfires weren't damaging me. 
---
There we go, I must be a shill if I'm not shitting on the company, gotcha. Nice having you not respond to me anymore, how's that going for you?
---
Spoiler. Activision Blizzard is making A Destiny clone that has esports included with Overwatch. The "A team" at Blizzard is on this, like Tom Chilton. They are letting stooges like Ion run WoW into the ground because they want it to die or be "sunset". 
---
It's gonna be either Starcraft or Overwatch online. I would be on Starcraft with just the Overwatch classes shipped to have the initial PvP worked out.
---
Blizzard cares about esports and mobile and that's it. It's why they bought MLG. It's why they ruined WoW trying to make PvP and PVE an esport. 
---
They don't wan to make WoW and they don't want us as customers. They want dumb people who buy lootboxes and who are delusional enough to think they can be esport "athletes" instead.
---
40 is the cap, not the requirement.  tho apparently i shoulda asked what's a good setup for smallest viable group size
---
I bet you went through a LOT of mana potions.
---
Pvp is stupid
---
If your PC can handle it multiboxing an entire 5 man party is pretty easy in vanilla because nothing has real mechanics. I already have my party planned out. If I can find a program that actually works on a private server I'll test a few comps out beforehand.
---
I agree with most of this but to be completely fair it wasn't until very recently that people realized ferals could pull\~1000dps and BiS helm is a level 40 crafted blue and BiS weapon is a level 29 blue that you have to farm a couple dozen of for each raid night.
---
I suppose it depends on the instance and boss fight. The mana regen is very nice. 
---
When retail first came out everybody pretty much expected priests/druids to heal. While Shamans/paladins didn't have the greatest itemization and most of these guys went dps spec anyway. So it kinda makes sense why priests/druids would be spammed of whispers.  On my priest it got so bad I had to make a macros to auto paste shadow priest in whipsers.
---
The best advice is to go whatever you want to play. It's kinda to try and figure this out. The one thing you should know is that healers and tanks are always wanted. It's usually the dps classes where groups try and avoid having two of the same class in the same group. 
---
Anyway from my exp it's usually rogues, hunters or dps warriors spots that get rejected.
---
Most campfires still damage you.
---
Raids didn’t scale. Going with fewer people just meant it was all around harder.
---
Raiding requires multiple tanks, healers, and dps. Whatever valid classes fit those roles can find places in raids.
---
Yup. If it's a toggle option, I don't see the problem. 
---
Fire doesn’t do damage in retail?!
---
Because the spreadsheet, like any sim, assumes you \*don't\* take 500 damage for 30 minutes. Like any sim, it's a perfect-world scenario that only gives you a half truth. 
---
Lol ele shaman in almost every category? Not sure how I feel about this as an ele shaman back in vanilla. 
---
I'd say fire mage is a pretty tough class to counter as a shaman in general unless you have a back up res set. 
---
Not since Ragnaros was destroyed. Fire mages and demo warlocks can often be seen weeping into their beers in various inns worldwide.
---
I feel like you really want to play a Shaman when classic releases. 
---
I guess it depends if your class/spec is weak to being stun cc'd. War stomp can work on any class where as hardiness is good mainly vs rogues, hammer of justice, etc. 
---
First or second best raiding guild of the server...face palm dream on bro 
---
You say pvp but your breakdown is duels? 1v1 doesn’t happen in bgs, are you talking world pvp? Too much depends on profs and there is no comment on cool downs or gearing or what spot in classic you are referring to. And if you aren’t sure on which spec rogues and warriors will be using for pvp the list loses a ton of merit. 
---
You have the most laughable freakin post history of all time that supports everything Blizzard has ever done on every product. You also attacked with vitriol 2 people (and slandered one) to protect or defend that product.
---
Logic dictates you are either a employee/marketing or a shareholder. Either way you are a joke. Remember what I said about the stock. It WILL go back up but when it crashes this time it will be worse. Or? Just lose a ton of money. I don't care. The old CEO was smart enough to know when to sell stock.

---
Mages destroy hunters. Interupts don't matter because hunters are dead to instant spells.
---
Once MC is on farm you can easily split your raid into two groups of 20 for maximum Ony loot. 
---
PVE is just a means to be stronger in PVP, you've made the right choice
---
Hard to say because it depends on the class. I think PVP gear was meant to be the equivalent of BWL level gear, which makes sense since by the time you get to AQ and beyond the gear outpaces PVP stuff with the exception of PVP weapons. 
---
No cause its 1.12 talents and a whole lot more knowledge and theory crafting so none of the raids feel like vanilla. When I checked the parse the number one vael kill on one of the servers was 20 seconds. MC can be cleared fully in like 45 minutes.
---
I think orc is better than tauren. Also taurens get stuck on door frames when mounted all the time which is annoying
---
Isn’t there already one that was in the demo?
---
In Moonkin form in TBC, you get mana back when you melee.  Not just OOC procs.
---
rogue - shadowpanther.net
---
Absolutely agree... I do think it might be a similar situation at lunch tho just because there is nothing good over there right now.  We will see what happens a bit down the road when Pantheon and the games you mention come out since there are a handful of big budget MMOs coming out soon.
---
've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.

" Personally, I have decided to go the route of slightly hindering my leveling experience to maximize my enjoyment of the game later on being a needed/very useful part of end game content. "
---
I dont understand what you wrote here. Why would your leveling experience have anything to do with what you are doing end game?
---
If you mean that you want to level as a meme spec and continue to be that spec at 60 in raids until end game, then that is possible for sure. You can easily clear every raid in Vanilla with a ret paladin from Ony to KT. The problem with it is that you will eventually be asked to do another role that is optimal, and thats not fun for anyone I think. Lets say you have been raiding as ret or elemental or shadow or whatever for like 2 months. Then suddenly one day your raid is lacking holy paladins, and the raid leader/officer asks you to be holy for the night, thats gonna be a pretty annoying situation. I think the most important part of maining a meme spec in raids is to be on good and clear terms with the guild leaders, to be allowed to only play that spec in raid no matter what.
---
Where is this "hard" you speak of? Classic is a great game and it might be many things but hard isn't one of them. 
---
Haha, this is pretty true. I've never played one but have had my ass kicked many times by them. 
---
I think I'll try out for nostalgia's sake but doubt I'll stick with it - I simply don't have the time now. 7-8 days /played to get to level 60 is huge for sometime who plays casually an hour or 2, a few nights a week. 
---
Retail is letting me level up alts fairly quickly with heirlooms and rotating rested XP
---
Wha? Thats space for.... you know...... the in-game world itself. Players...... buildings, you know..... the world?
---
My UI can hangout in my peripheral vision.
---
&gt; "people will leave once they realize how hard classic was" or "people will just go back for nostalgia then leave"
---
-
---
This is absolutely true.
---
For some people.
---
But there are many others that have been playing on private servers over the past 4 years.    
---
Levelling up again, doing the same rep grinds, clearing the same raids and pushing for the same rank on each new server.
---
The current largest server has nearly 1,500,000 accounts made.    
---
And has nearly 300,000 active accounts (logged in within the past 100 days).
---
^^\([source](https://i.imgur.com/7QtbccM.jpg))
---
Servers like these wouldn't happen if players were going to leave once they realised how hard it is, or if it were just a nostalgia kick.
---
You had me until that Terminator unit.
---
Thats just..... too far.
---
The fans dont trust Blizzard to make their own game. So, you know, they expect Blizzard to make WoW THEIR (the fans) way..... even though they don't all agree......
---
The whole thing is just..... does not compute. Shitty track record or not, Blizz is gonna do what they want.
---
I feel like that's comparing a steak to a bag of potato chips yes *technically* you'll get more, but will you really?
---
Yeah I uh...... don't really understand those people. Have fans ever really policed a gaming company into making games the way they demanded? Especially so...... specifically? 
---
I wouldn't mind a carbon copy of WoW, but i'd prefer a WoW remaster because....... frankly i'm going to be playing the game in 4K anyway....... why the fuck should the rest of the game benefit (graphically) in no way whatsoever.
---
Across the board you overrate shamans and underrate rogues.  A smart rogue will take good fights only, and if he gets behind will cheese reset and come back with a CD advantage.  A perfectly played prep rogue with full CDs, consumables, and engineering can almost guaranteed win any 1v1.  The only thing that comes close in 1v1, is a mage with an equal level of skill and consumables.  
---
Probably not a surprise those are classes with most control and strongest CDs in game.  
---
In terms of specifics on your list:
---
Frost against elemental shaman is quite easy once you understand what is happening.  Shocks are 20 yard range, so if you kite them like they are melee they cannot interrupt you.  Spam R1 frostbolt to keep them slowed and eat grounding.  If they try and cast on you all their long range damage is on same tree as their heals.  Try to get them below half before you CS so you secure the win.  If they survive or if anything goes wrong poly and reset.  
---
Hardest is actually:  Defensive build demo lock with felhunter.  The pet is unkillable so you can't cc, they just drain-tank you spamming tongues, fear, and dots.  Only way to win is hyper aggression.  Nova shatter combo as fast as possible iceblocking off the deathcoil then coldsnapping and going again.  Shadow reflector is a gigantic help, but kinda cheesy.  If the warlock is a try hard with pots and tuber or you are missing any major CDs, you literally cannot blow through his HP fast enough to get a kill.  
---
Warrior is very easy for shadow at low gear, but by ~AQ40 gear warriors start 1shotting your shield so you lose the advantage of rage starving them.  Also MS is dominate warrior pvp spec, but fury pve build works very well against shadow as deathwish makes your only control as shadow meaningless.  
---
Shadow priest hardest matchup is a disc priest.  Disc can outheal the damage, and will just spam imp mana burns into your face until you are oom.  As a healer they will have better regen, and just kill you slowly.  If you don't want healer specs, then once again SL lock with do similar things that it did to mage.  Priest might be in slightly better shape as it at least stop a lot of the locks damage.  
---
This is the same for practically all casters that can't keep a disc priest controlled.  They will just win via mana burn.  
---
Any non-hardcore guild that denies a class based on race is just completely out of the spirit of the game.  At least, the non-hardcore spirit.
---
Guess I'll find out in the summer! 
---
Definitely looking forward to proper talent trees again. 
---
Will miss the QoL improvements for alts tho. 
---
It is true that in BGs your effectiveness is more than what you can do in a 1v1 situation, but you do find yourself in that 1v1 even in BGs at times. And yes, this exercise does not take into account so many other variables like gear, cool downs, who you are with, etc. But I think it is useful, in general, as a way of understanding classes key abilities and strategies, which for me helps me understand my opponent better whether 1v1 or in a group. 
---
&gt; And if you aren’t sure on which spec rogues and warriors will be using for pvp the list loses a ton of merit. 
---
I acknowledged that the list was incomplete and surely had errors, I set it up so others could fill in the blanks and make corrections. 
---
I've played both classes and there is no way a mage is going to destroy a hunter all things being equal. Unless you're talking about a POM mage with the double trinket who can one-shot you. Which I'm not counting as that was a bit of an OP bug IMO, that got rightfully nerfed. 
---
If there is Dire Maul, world buffs, it won't be hard.  
---
Thanks for sharing. 
---
I'm one of these people. I cant get enough.
---
What is tough is sticking to your priorities in life that matter. And gaming the rest of the time 😁
---
Sure but In classic levelling up is part of the core game. It's not meant to just be a rush to level 60, although hardcore players will always rush. During levelling in classic it's a lot more engaging along the way, it's not just: log on&gt; queue dungeon &gt; log off like in retail. There is no rush! I never even maxed back in classic/bc but I still found that experience more engaging than the faceroll endgame content in retail.
---
Hah!
---
Agree, also I'm not really into end-game so maybe it won't bother me as much, we'll see! 
---
In on this. Shoot me a message if you need some more. I played vanilla / bc but never got into end game content 
---
Try pulling more than 3 mobs without being in a group...
---
Problem is that I want to be hardcore, but I still wont be a human for it lol
---
Aside from my love of gnomes, that is my thinking as well. What do you do when you've got complete BiS? PVP.  
---
I hear ya, I'm being a bit over zealous about them. Admittedly I have not played them. But Earth Shock, an instant cast, that hits you like a truck, prevents spells from that school for 5 secs, and has a 6 second CD is pretty nasty for casters. And Frost Shock, slows you, for 8 seconds, this can keep players in permanent slow. Very useful for kiting melee. 
---
So, yeah, I'm making assumptions. So, are you saying Ele wasn't that powerful?
---
&gt; Hunter: Toughest - Enh Shaman
---
This might be the worst take of all time
---
People will leave because a lot of the people that will try out classic come from retail, and a lot of retail player like that style of game better. 
---
That would be your faulty memory because they do. 
---
It still does, but it's like 1-5hp when you have 200k HP...
---
Everything in Classic is harder except for high-end raiding.
---
The problem with most pre-raid BIS lists is that they're not patch 1.12, because the assumption is that by the time you reach patch 1.12, you have raid gear.  
---
Classic is different. We're starting in patch 1.12 so pre-raid items available in patch 1.12 are different from the ones shown on most pre-raid lists. Obviously some lists get it right, but most get it wrong.  
---
Haha, this is me because it's just so convenient. Oh a few more mobs/quests/elemental w/e's.
---
&gt; And Frost Shock, slows you, for 8 seconds, this can keep players in permanent slow.
---
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Frost_Shock#Patch_changes 1.4
---
I've played more vanilla mage PVP than anything and it's true. Dance around in their dead zone spamming arcane explosion, fire blast, frost nova, coc and maybe sneaking in a frost bolt. If they manage to escape, blink back into the dead zone. Ice block is there to wait for timer resets or remove debuffs. It's not very mana efficient but very effective. 
---
I usually make goals for myself. So like a contingency if I have no reached them as well. It helps me still achieve a goal without staying up past my bedtime. Like making it to an inn. Or hearing when it's up to put stuff on the AH before bed. If you let it interfere with sleep that shit catches up to you fast haha.
---
In Australia summer goes from the 1st of December until the 28th/29th of Feb.
---
And winter goes from the 1st of June until the 31st of August. 
---
I haven't played Vanilla but tried one of those private servers couple of weeks before the Classic announce (then I stopped playing the private to play on Classic as something totally new for me).
---
Anyway, made a Rogue and my biggest surprise (and I've found quite hard to get used to) was the Energy Regen model haha
---
Orc pvp, troll pve for shaman. 
---
Any class can beat every class with consumables, proper use of engineering and trinkets. The game is actually more balanced in vanilla due to this than modern WoW. The closest thing to gamebreaking classes the game has is probably SL Lock and Spriest. Spriest can be viperstung so they do nothing in a BG and SL Lock kills so slow it's not considered that bad and people never cried about it (even though it's the most broken spec in the game). 
---
Without the consumables and trinkets and engineering, balance is screwed just like any MMO ever. Balance in a MMO is impossible, unless you make all the classes so similar you no longer have classes (modern WoW). The problem with that is one of those similar classes is always going to be slightly better. Because they are so similar? Everyone plays that class, making the balance pointless. Might as well make a game with one caster, one melee and one healer. 
---
**TLDR. Play what you want. Good players beat bad players in vanilla.**
---
Are you talking about while levelling? Because nearly all of these are completely wrong at lvl 60.
---
CaMe AcRoSsEd 
---
&gt;No they really don't
---
Yes they do. Progression comes from throughput. The easiest way to increase throughput is to use an appropriate spec and rotation. The difference between a top performing spec and a bottom performing spec could easily be the difference of 80% or more throughput.
---
&gt; Players' ability to not fuck up and wipe the raid matters. 
---
Right. And when players inevitably "fuck up" and the raid is faced with adversity, throughput carries them through the fight. If you are taking a sub par spec for progression, you have already fucked up before the raid has even began.
---
&gt; What you call appropriate leadership and understanding of the content is actually quite rare. 
---
What guilds have you been in... I have been in REALLY casual guilds and the leadership was able to establish expectations... Im starting to think that you might be the issue...
---
&gt; Good raidleaders are hard to come by 
---
Yep. That confirms it.
---
&gt; getting 40 people to keep their focus and not randomly AFK in the middle of a raid is harder than you think 
---
Is it? I mean... I have seen people randomly afk in pugs, and they are quickly replaced and you continue forward but in your guild??? You have really been scraping the bottom of the barrel to get a spot, you must be awful.
---
&gt; As for hunters they pretty much only do well in MC content. 
---
Concerning Borthwale, look again. Where is the server progressed to? BWL on farm. Hunters were top all through leveling, pre raid, MC, and 3/4 of BWL progression. Which is 2 tiers out of 3 isnt it? I would know, I am a hunter on Borthwale =)
---
&gt; Maybe you as a hunter expert can explain why hunters do a lot better in MC than BWL when the gear is the same? 
---
Because the gear isnt the same. Hunters thrive in MC because a bulk of their damage comes from pet damage, specifically Lupos who is using shadow damage instead of physical to avoid boss armor. Due to the pet, a large chunk of their damage is unaffected by gear. Giving hunters an advantage when everyone is undergeared. Secondly hunters dont scale well in gear and tend to tucker out on longer encounters due to their damage ramping up quickly and then staying relatively flat. Also hunters are one of the few classes that can drop combat (with feign) which allows them to be less frugal with their resources and that can be quite effective when other classes are forced to play more conservative during early content. Hunters are top DPS in MC and continue as top DPS throughout the progression of BWL. A large reason is because other classes depend on many MC and BWL drops to compete. Even after a guild is fully progressed through BWL and geared, a well played hunter feign/swapping trinkets will be far above average during the raid. Hunters dont tether off until AQ. Hunters do very well on trash fights as well, which typically isnt factored into their performance on charts but is typically more important for guilds who are going for timed clears. A hunter using explosive trap + engi charges + multi shot can put out absurd aoe damage.
---
TLDR; youre wrong, hunters are fantastic in MC and throughout BWL progression. Amazing levelers. Amazing in PVP both solo and in groups. Amazing for farming and generating gold. They fall in AQ and do poor in Naxx. A small trade off for dominance in every other facet of the game. 
---
"Hunters are actually really bad in vanilla" - have you played vanilla? hahaha.
---
&gt; as a warlock I find them the easiest to kill 
---
Okay. A good MM hunter in a premade will keep you at range and smother you. A good hunter using a bat in a duel wont get hit by you unless you are using A LOT of consumes. Warlocks are MONSTERS in PVP after they are post tier 2. Hunters are monsters from level 11-Forever in PVP.
---
Hunters are great in vanilla and are only weak in Naxx, but even then, they are needed arent they? A guild will still bring 1 or 2. Granted you really trailed off from our original argument about the content being trivial as you have now acknowledged that the content is trivial... So im not really sure why im bothering with this thread anymore. You dont know anything about hunters and you gave up on your argument about itemization because thats a relatively insignificant nuance in contrast to the lack of difficulty in vanilla... Hopefully you learned something.
---
It only really looks good because the warlock is standing still. You'd get much more damage out if you had SotC and let's say a level 60 weapon.
---
I just want the sound file.
---
&gt; Hunter (Marksmanship) -
---
I don't even know what to start with-
---
&gt; Also by this logic rogues and warriors should fare well against hunters.  
---
LOL
---
Hunters stomp melees harder than anything. Only casters are an issue, warlocks being the worst with spriests not too far behind. Mages are a massive pain as well because they can just deadzone the hunter via nova and then shatter for over 60% of their health.
---
You really have no clue what you're talking about.
---
Yeah a good Priest or Shaman is good against it, but if you don't have one to pocket dispels... feels bad.
---
You'd still be better off with arms. More damaging abilities and general use. Paladins are meant as a support class for the alliance like shamans for the horde.
---
Try playing those classes at max level instead of leveling where hunter beats every other class because of how OP pet scaling and overall hunter scaling is pre-60.
---
Any twink info? I’d like to view bis lists for various brackets.
---
&gt; It only really looks good because the warlock is standing still
---
Standing still AND spam sitting to take crits.
---
TF shares a debuff slot with Thunderclap in the 14th spot.
---
Retail is at its lowest sub count because its trash. Theres a reason there isnt 12 million players anymore. 
---
Expose Armor is bugged on pservers and allows for warriors to keep spamming sunders for threat. The correct behaviour would be for warriors to be unable to use sunder and get a "more powerful spell in effect" error message.
---
As a five man, ony is the only one possible. In the other raids there may be an encounter here or there you could do as 5, but you'd never get there on your own.  MC you wouldn't make it past a fire lord because of the spawns. Zg has bezerkers that would rek one tank. Aq20 you might make it to the first boss but without an off tank to soak ms and enough dps for the enrage phase you won't kill him. And forget anything higher tier than that. 
---
New meta is running fury tanks with enough points in prot to grab defiance. If you have good gear and competent healers you can dualwield on almost all bosses and in turn generate insane threat (easily 2-3x a standard deep prot spec). Considering how much the game has been mix-maxed it's basically necessary to keep up in the end game since everyone starts doing insane dps post aq, especially the mage who gets ignite up. Something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LoZVVzmxxoVoViz0x
---
If you like healing paladin is a fine option, and I would recommend it if that was the case.
---
Side note paladin and hunter is an insane duo if skill capped, if played perfectly they are almost impossible to kill.
---
However, Rogue would be good because you both could dps together and not compete for any loot. Dungeon runs would go very fast. Also you could make friends with a priest, since day one rogue/mage/priest has been the greatest trio. Change my mind.
---
Healer? Or dps? That’s what you’re asking here. Ret is trash.
---
Good strategy, thanks for breaking that down for me. I would not have thought to use a rotation like that. 
---
This is me putting on aspect of the cheetah after using an invisibility potion 
---
I'll play it for the sake of the general harder and calculated gameplay, fellowship, less content congestion, more individual class style, and World PvP. 
---
But when people argue "it's only nostalgia" then I can't completely disagree. Fact is most people are being pulled by the hard, grouping way of playing WoW instead of this weenie hut jr solo pull 30 mobs at once "DESTROY THIS AND SAFE US HERO" diablo retail version.
---
On the other hand, people yell for "#nochanges" instead of "Remastered/Reborn" like over the years nothing ever good changed, but that's not true.
---
Mythic Raid Bosses are way harder and more challenging than Bosses like Ragnaros will ever be, which is only natural since notably, the skill increased but also the help of addons exploded, and also we talk about a backport here so add-ons as Weak Auras will work fine, spells can now properly be tracked and so on. (PS: Yes, I know Auto Heal but what is so different to Grid + Click to Heal or Healbot, that you now have to move your mouse across what is glowing?)
---
The whole PvP System is garbage, not the titles which are fine but how you achieve it has nothing to do with proving skill to earn it just ridiculous welfare farming, botting or account sharing.
---
The Quests, and while the enemies are now harder to kill it's 90% of the time just a tedious kill quest, mobs with a respawn time of 90 minutes or a drop chance for the quest item of 0.1% to stretch content artificially hence why even some Leveling Guides end in "and grind the rest 30% to the next level".
---
And while you all agree to rather accept to this deal instead of ever playing that weenie hut jr version it still means that an agreement has been made that most players unlike the people of this sub will probably ride like a short hype wave until they reach the shimmering lands.
---
In short it is true in my opinion that people tend to overhype Vanilla particullary when they lie to themself e.g "What I hate about retail WoW is you take a quests and it immediately shows you where to walk... that's so boring back then I read the text" and then almost everyone uses Questie however I don't think that Vanilla will die out. Vanilla vs Retail is just an absolute different way of playing the game with other objectives but the same story.
---
imagine being immune to fire
---
:) You are probably right. But I was hoping you could enlighten me as to what is the Hunter's toughest foe. 
---
yes
---
"spamming rotations mindlessly"
---
You are absolutely right. It's more about spamming frostbolt mindlessly.
---
When it comes down to it there are three options: 1. Have a job. 2. Have a life. 3. Make it through Naxx. You only get to pick two. God help you if you try to juggle all three, the struggle is real.
---
God, nighthold was such an amazing raid (despite artifact weapon farming) and I truly LOVED the fight we gul'dan. So epic when I got him first time on each mode.   
---
  
---
However Tomb of Sargeras was the most aids raid ever. So many soak mechanics. 7/9 bosses had soak mechanics, so punishing too. One person fucks up and whole raid sinks. I understand it for a couple bosses , but 7?...  
---
I quit when hurricane Irma took my power out for 10 days, helped me realized what the game had become.  
---
All around good expansion though aside from the downsides. M+ was genuinely challenging.
---
A few days late, but Jelial from &lt;Infused&gt; here. I used to drool over your guys gear.
---
Got to team up with Lighten during BC on his Spriest. I miss Infused :(
---
This video is using a known exploit that only exists on private servers. Don't roll a Ret Paladin.
---
Found the shaman main LOL 
---
Even with a perfectly balanced game you are always going to be, for each individual class, that one class/spec that is usually beats you (all things being equal, like gear and skill). And also that one class/spec that is easy for you to beat.
---
I'm not looking for the most OP class. I'm trying to get better at pvp, because, as you might have guessed, I'm not great. Hearing other peoples strategies against this class or that is helpful.  For example, mages beating hunters easily by staying in their dead zone and spamming AB is a strategy I would not have thought of. 
---
There is going to be more than enough players that are interested in playing this style of game to make servers feel full and have active communities.  This is a niche product, but there is a market for that.  There will be a nostalgia and retail group that cruise through and some may stay longer, but it's primarily for the group of people they already know exist who will play this game.
---
Its tunable.  During an planned role play event they turned off sharding and were able to handle hundreds of players in the same spot.
---
Having come from EverQuest, I always found WoW downright easy, but in a good way.  It didn't make itself hard through painful time syncs and punitive punishments.  
---
when legion first came out fire mages were good then we got nerfed into Oblivion
---
It only takes 1 damge to knock you out of stealth. 
---
The meme lies!
---
Excellent information. Thanks.
---
We have no idea how accurate private server numbers are so buffing based on that wouldn’t work.
---
Only blizzard have the data to decide what does and doesn’t need a buff.
---
This is why we need a beta ASAP 
---
Honestly man there is so much garbage coming out of your mouth. You have no idea what your are talking about when it comes to vanilla.

There are those who played EQ and knew pain and then there were those who played classic and said “ this is when MMOs are hard”. Never had to pay plat for a Rez; lose xp on death ; corpse run. Someone run a mob train into your camp.... 
---
Out here saying yeah but we had to sheep mobs... meanwhile in eq we had enchanters charming mobs and crazy cc.... shit was heated!
---
While deployed I am stuck recording off an app on my phone. Will definitely be getting a mic when I get home.
---
You already came to the revelation that I'm a Blizzard shill yo.
---
Remember when you said this?
---
&gt; Now I'm done talking to you.
---
warlocks are even worse than shadowpriests i feel like for a mage
---
Lose
---
I never understood this attitude, you don't have the time for it and you don't even bother about the engame, why in the hell would you speedrun level 60 then?
---
Even if you lose the shield, you just equip something else. It's an amazing ring while you can keep the shield up. 
---
Hunter is weak to Shadow Priests &amp; Warlocks and a skilled Frost Mage can be mage favoured. It is strong against everything else. Could lose to a prep rogue with all cooldowns up.
---
I'm very tempted to try shaman in classic and I really only pvp in bg's. What's a strong bracket to sit for shaman? Going Tauren would alchemy and herb be beneficial for shamans or would you recommend other professions?
---
http://classicdb.ch
---
In your search cut the item level between 20-30.
---
I doubt anyone will take the time for your post to make a guide for you. So just in case I'm wrong, that's where you can start doing your research. 
---
not true. a
---
Let’s not forget the hidden racial of increased melee distance that Tauren have.
---
Is it still 10k starting bid like it was in MoP?
---
Yeah, I will not go human again.  Did that for a good chunk of my Warrior’s life and I don’t care for it.
---
Where are you seeing people say this stuff? Seems like the same soapbox post we’ve read a million times 
---
After leveling rogues for years, the hunter was an eye-opening experience. Maybe it isn't quite on par with the paladin, but you can definitively keep one hand free. 
---
\*casually AoEs pack of 12 Worgen\*
---
Most are going to say Orc here but once you really start competing at a high level you will see how powerful war stomp is on a shaman. It has the most synergy of all classes than can roll shaman. It opens up spell-lock combo's that just aren't  possible with troll or orc. You'll often be harassing casters in premade BGs and when you combine earth shock+grounding+war stomp in certain orders(2x or even 3x earth shocks with your weapon knockbacks) you can make them cry. I've forced paladins to bubble so they can keep their target alive. When orc stun resist procs it's obviously great but in half of your fights it will be a useless racial. I prefer the consistency and reliability of war stomp, and obviously it has defensive uses such as stomp lesser healing wave with 0 interruption. Of course 5% hp is nice too.
---
&gt; There is going to be more than enough players that are interested in playing this style of game to make servers feel full and have active communities. 
---
Of course. Just like there is currently on private servers. I'm just saying most of the people who will be playing around launch won't stick around for too long. 
---
Originally, the timer didn't start until you killed a boss.
---
Right, I was hoping there was some guide already out there like how there are warrior guide which include all weapons available during leveling.
---
Some bosses are still hard even with worldbuffs, but less hard true.
---
Melee physical dps classes NEED at least somewhat decent weapons. Clothies don't really need good gear all that much while leveling.
---
And before about L30 pretty much any class gets by with just quest rewards and random drops just fine. Feel free to keep your character decked out as they level if you want, but that sort of thing you don't tend to see guides for.
---
In vanilla it also had the 1 rage per 3 second tick only that it was hidden and not described in the talent description.
---
It is not broken on private servers. It's working as it did.
---
Also their tier gear is bis and you easily get enough mana for most fights from that alone. It stops being an issue at all very fast.
---
Dps and tank didn't care, our shaman healer rolled for it too but I won. They said "wtf?" and I said it was an upgrade for me. They told me it was a healer item and actually pre-raid BIS. I didn't understand itemization too well outside the basics, so I was I said oh, sorry, I screwed up. I asked if they wanted gold to make it up to them and they said forget it and left the group.
---
To further the injustice, this LBRS run was taking a while and was running right up against my guild's scheduled Ony raid. Once the shaman left I had to immediately leave and get invited a few minutes late into the raid and get summoned. I ended up getting the t2 helmet that night, not an hour after accidentally stealing that 1% drop chance healer item.
---
Modern WoW have people running around in a transmog where their shoulderpad(s) have more polygons than the rest of whatever they're wearing. Graphics have been a very weak part ever since Wrath released compared to other MMOs at the time.
---
retail isn't going to die. 
---
Unpopular Opinion: Modern WoW's art design is too shiny, flashy, and oversatured. 
---
You want the staff from Twilight Lord Kelris in Blackfathom Deeps.
---
It would seem that even the slightest of negative remarks about sharding gets you placed at the equivalent of an anti-vaxxer table.
---
Would be cool to get the chance to time and record my first run at launch.
---
Dueling is the best teacher but I would say join the "Classic PvP" discord (you don't have to talk or anything), check out Tip's Out PvP summit videos which have hours of information. If you are looking to get better at a particular class a lot of content creators are there.
---
I would also say completely ignore old real Vanilla videos, which are often not 1.12 or against and with people who have no idea how to play their class and who just outgeared people. To be completely honest? We sucked back then at PvP. PVE we weren't near as bad at because rotations were so easy.
---
I could give you tips for about every class but so can all these videos. If you are looking for one class in particular I can direct you somewhere. I would say mages druids and rogues are probably the hardest to learn because a lot of what they are doing is hard to see on the screen or follow. Rogues have a stupid amount of tricks they do and you just have to practice them. I would say mages are more about movement, knowing what to counterspell and block and abusing the heck out of level 1 blizzard and frostbolt. In fact if you are gonna play mage, just bind rank 1 blizzard to the S key.  You will now beat 90 percent of the rogues out there. Mages still have tricks as I said though and most are bad at them. People face an opponent to sheep even when it has no facing requirement (and this is a mistake people make on a lot of classes) and lose a second there. They move wrong and don't strafe sideways or on a angle (why I recommended putting Blizzard on the s key).  They don't put warriors in charge with an instant cast that is sitting there in their spellbook.
---
Hunters are also very hard to learn, but there are probably a lot of good vides ouf there showing traps, tricks. Mages and rogues tend to be a lot of super competitive people who don't share tips that often. They just make flashy pvp videos to show off.
---
Warriors and druids also have macros that are very important and that make the class stupidly easier to play. An example of this would be charge hamstring on one button. Rogues and mages mouseovers (especially on things like sheep or blind) are really important and you have an expose armor macro that is a big deal. 
---
Biggest thing? Duel. Lose. Duel Lose. Duel get close. Duel get closer. Duel win your share. Experience is the best teacher. The duel spots in vanilla were in front nor org and in front of Ironforge. All day people would be out there to train against who also wanted to get better like you. Some are aholes. Some make excuses. Some say GG and only blame themselves for their failure and vow to get better. If you are the last type? You will be one of the best. 
---
You don't have unlimited potions. Also popping FAP is considered try-hard/disrespectful in World PvP/Duels. You'll also get a reputation in BG's if you literally pop a FAP on cooldown. Once in awhile, okay. While flag running, while outnumbered etc. But if every time a rogue opens on you, you pop a fap, then it's objectively /lol
---
Legion was far and away the best expansion since WOTLK.  this is hilarious. 
---
No, it only gives rage when in combat. When out of combat it does what the tooltip says, slows rage decay.
---
0
---
I would have preferred a full progressive server, but we are getting a 1.12 server.  The stats on NPCs should be what they were at 1.12.  
---
Anyways, the largest variable that is different is knowledge.  Literally no one knew back then the fights or how to gear originally.  Going back to original difficulty back is impossible.  It would be impossible to correct for that since different people will go in with different levels of information.    To scale up the bosses so that a player with knowledge would experience the same difficulty that existed in 2004, would be to create fights that would be wholly impossible for newcomers.  
---
We are not recreating 2004, we are just getting a chance to play the game again.  
---
What are you going instead?  
---
I currently raid as horde and a common meme is that alliance tanks are lazy and not as good as horde tanks due to rarely/never having to worry about threat.
---
I'd suggest an energy timer for that reason. It's nice to open right before your energy "ticks".
---
Iirc the talisman wasn't supposed to drop, it was accidentally left on the loottables. I understand why they patch that out.
---
No need to brag bro
---
The fact that WoW, multiple expansions later and 70 levels later, has less complexity with less abilities and not a single roleplaying element left. The game has devolved and the latest expansion made the game worse than the previous one. That's a paradox for what expansions are supposed to do. It's in the name.. expansion....
---
Purely as a thought exercise I think the ultimate group would be:
---
1) Warrior tank - might be a druid, but I don't have tanking experience
---
2) Paladin healer - most efficient single target healer
---
3) Hunter DPS - even after oom they can still do DPS, at range for fights like Only phase 2
---
4) Rogue or Feral druid DPS - energy based melee doesn't go oom; only 5 people removes issues with debuff limit making feral a bit better, while having an innervate and battle rez when things turn sour.
---
5) Warlock DPS - spellcaster when physical damage doesn't cut it, support from life-/soulstones can be a lifesaver.
---
Complete waste of time and resources for Blizzard. A better solution is to use the old itemization, old debuffs and to space out the content more in patches. The talents matter a lot but if they stack the OP classes too much to take advantage they get no loot. By AQ the problem is gone. By spacing out the content more you slow down any faster progression due to the talents. So what, powergamers get mad that they have to wait until BWL comes out just like they did in real Vanilla. The game doesn't revolve around them. If it did modern WoW would be at an all time high with Mythic raiding. No one gives a sh@#%. 
---
As to why I say to use old itemization, debuffs? PVE Servers exist and you don't want this to be easier than LFR. I have no interest in a PVE Server, but they need a goal, progression and a sense of accomplishment besides /dancing with a friend who is teabagging someone in catform. Also if you make the content too easy, the hardcores are just gonna run MC with half raids and gear twice as fast. It would be a major problem.
---
I suppose the ring is best for Shamans and Paladins? Still good for priest and druids I guess but superior for paly and priest
---
That's not hard, know what you can pull depending on your class and it just becomes a tedious cakewalk. There was no actual difficulty in classic, raids weren't hard, most people had no idea what they were doing, and bosses were overtuned forcing players to improvise and cheese a la Naxx. A 40 minute run from SW to Stromgarde isn't hard, it's time consuming, and imo the only good thing about classic was class design and the bomb ass community. TBC and Wrath were better, they took the few good parts of Vanilla and made them 10x better while keeping the community engaged. This whole "this is objectively better because of this and that" is bullshit. It's going to be subjective at the end of the day as people will prefer different aspects of different xpacs for whatever reason, and personal enjoyment will never be "objective" and should never be taken seriously. 
---
Ret palas are ok in pvp. In fact all hybrids are either ok or good in pvp. Its in raids where they all fall faaaar behind, except feral druid, who is kinda bad in pvp but ok in raids.
---
These people will never understand what actual difficulty is. WoW was THE casual EQ, it just managed to have an amazing community and pull more people together because of that. 
---
Did you even play Vanilla? Nothing he said was a lie, you can live in your nostalgia based denial all you want, but it doesn't change the truth. Vanilla wasn't hard, but was a tedious timesink. EQ was hard, WoW was casual, but was more fun because of the community. Damn 12 year olds thinking their pserver vanilla experience counts. 
---
Its weird. You are the perfect vanilla player and the game is desinged for people like you but for some weird reason you dont think the game is for you...
---
As someone who still plays on a time-locked EQ2 server, I can sincerely say that a lot of people who have not played classic WoW will bounce once the nostalgia goes away.
---
These games of 2004 (EQ2, WoW) were very rough, not very player-friendly in certain aspects, missing a lot of QoL stuff that people are used to today. 
---
Combine with that that people who played it back then were 14-15 years young and now a majority have kids and families,  their gaming times will be different and people will be hoping to pop in and get to do stuff instead of camping a mob for 3 nights straight.
---
Also, in 1999-2004, these MMOs were a window for people to connect, talk and make friends - especially if you were slightly introverted, shy, etc.
---
Nowadays, people have social networks for that, games don't need to be "MSN with swords and sorcery" to keep people hooked.
---
What I'm saying is - as someone who's actually playing these servers:
---
- there will be a lot of people trying it, for nostalgia's sake
---
- once the nostalgia goes away, there'll be a massive drop in server population (it just will)
---
- on classic WoW, servers should still be very healthy and keep going
---
- QoL stuff will be (mostly) missing and people who want vanilla WoW with improvements on basic stuff that could and perhaps should be fixed will be complaining - while the vanilla purists will be up in arms over any changes regardless whether they make sense or not
---
Also, whether vanilla WoW was better than, lets say, Legion, is really up for debate.
---
(IMO it was not, Legion was refined, had QoL, plenty of challenge, etc. - but I tend to like vanilla games as well)
---
Also, do not confuse what classic WoW will be with private servers or Project1999 on EQ. These private servers are populated by people who were directly interested in vanilla content, going out of their way to find out about it, join a private server and most people stay there for a while.
---
Classic WoW, OTOH, will attract a fuckton of players, and a huge number of them won't stick around.
---
Some of them will be disillusioned and the nostalgia will dissipate and they'll realize they're playing a 15 year old game that was very rough around the edges, some will like retail more, etc.
---
And a number of players will stick around, like I said - some for good, some while waiting for Pantheon or something else that promises old-school feel etc.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm very excited for classic WoW, but I sort of know what to expect based on my own experience.
---
A lot of people will be disappointed, and most of those are super loud on various forums, and most of those never experienced a classic/time-locked server in one of these games.
---
Something practical: make sure that zones tie into an overall picture or have some sort of outline of a story going on. The environment itself tells a story. Serious zones with quest lines involving deeper characters are definitely a plus and have always been very well received. Meme quests, and just comedy and memes fitted into zones, quests and stories diminish it being serious and destroy immersion and the feeling of a story. For example compare the overall quests and feeling you get in western &amp; eastern plaguelands with Uldum, Mt Hyjal or Twilight Highlands in Cataclysm.... the tone is very different. The cataclysm zones sometimes have some degree of seriousness going on but so much attempts at comedy / memes etc that the story just ends up being bad overall. It also has to do with characterization, in vanilla twilight hammer was depicted as a mysterious cult that was an actual threat. They felt more like comic relief bad guys in Cataclysm. 
---
Something less practical given circumstances: make a story surrounding The Burning Crusade. They just threw big names familiar to warcraft 3 fans in The burning crusade and it lacked any sort of good story. The game itself could use a much better story with more complex and deeper characters. FFXIV manages to do that in some ways, WoW should've been able to deliver similar. I haven't really followed the story after wrath at all it just was retcon patch after retcon patch from there on out coupled with issues mentioned in the first paragraph.

A prebis warrior has about 3,2k health and 25% armor, because hes half leather.
---
The beginning of the second part of the last sentence is exactly right. You THINK classic is a better version of the game. I like classic more than current retail, but TBC? HELL No, Wrath? HELL NO MoP? HELL NO   
---
Another one with hot garbage mouth. Spew your trash all day dog. Your opinion is dripping wet stinky trash. 
---
I will 100% incorporate AM in every spec I use.
---
I love leveling way more than end game, and Classic is more geared to that, true. 
---
But it takes so much longer that I'll most likely end up with lots of low-mid level alts and never hit max level on any of them. That's the part that makes me think I'll get turned off Classic. 
---
At least in retail I can max out multiple alts, but in Classic I really can't see myself having lots of maxed classes, simply due to the fact I play WAY less than I did back in the day. 
---
Classic WoW isn't out yet, but should be out in this summer.
---
Classic WoW is a recreation of version on WoW from 12-14 years ago.
---
When it comes out there will be many people that have never tried at least that version of WoW before.    
---
So it'd be a pretty good time to start as a brand new player.
---
Just keep in mind that the version is a remake of the original and not some brand new fancy thing.
---
I can't speak much about the current version of the game (retail). It's been nearly 10 years since I've played it.    
---
It's changed so much from the game I once loved.    
---
Into something I barely recognise now.
---
That makes no sense... So how can you refresh the stack?
---
I was actually thinking Gnome prot Warrior at end game.  May go something else, but time will tell!
---
campfires made by players do not harm you
---
Yeah but the gloobal cooldown is 1sec so what is the point?
---
It is definitely 1 per 3 secs.  I even vaguely recall a CM or dev post briefly mentioning that the talent never actually worked correctly.  They added this 1 rage/3 secs thing, even though they weren't happy with this shoddy workaround, because it achieved the desired result.
---
It's an old game with an elder playerbase that grew up to have families to support and have limited time to sink into games in general. On top of that, you have games like fortnite that are more attractive to the younger audiences which would make WoW less likely to attract younger players. That's the reason.
---
I'm not arguing against the fact that BfA is total crap but if you are referring to the ever so casual state of WoW atm, it is a necessary design decision to attract a bunch of grandpas(including me) that are the main audience of WoW currently and going forward.
---
I mean the 7-8 points in arms - a lot of guides just advocate going 5/5 deflection and 2/5 tactical mastery to be enough to Mocking Blow.
---
If you arent taking an Impale spec, you can easily go 11 arms without losing anything important in Fury or Prot. If you ARE going Impale you can still take AM with 17 Arms and 3 Fury. 
---
I wholeheartedly believe the ONLY Warrior build that should avoid AM is the 0/35/15 Fury Prot dual wield variants. And I don't like those anyway as if you're dropping your shield just to gain threat you may as well swap to using a Bear Tank as they'll be better at both in this case. 
---
You can easily get round stance dancing as a thing you have to thnk about by proper mapping of your keys. Let's say Thunderclap is on "5" on your Battle Stance bar, as it can only be used in Battle stance.
---
Well, on your Def Stance and Zerk Stance bar, put "Change to Battle Stance" as your "5". Then, when you want to Thunderclap and you arent in Battlestance, you just press 5 twice. First changes to battle stance, which also changes the 5 button to be Thunderclap, second press hits it.
---
You can do this with Intercept, Disarm, Zerker Rage, Charge, Shield Wall etc. Then you dont really need to think about it as you sort of have access to all your skills in all stances. Just make sure you can swap back manually to each stance if needed too.
---
It's a lot easier than it seems, particularly with 5/5 tactical mastery where you keep 25 rage between swaps.
---
Yup definitely a little kid...
---
Disagree. As soon as the game started getting crap players left. Thats the only fact here.
---
1: There is no reason why you can't start playing Classic now (or at least when it launches summer 2019), no need for a time machine.
---
2: Classic is a real thing, release is sometime during summer 2019.
---
3: Which version of WoW a "noob" (please avoid that word if you play Classic, let's keep things positive :) should play is harder to answer. I am very biased towards Classic/Vanilla wow, so take my advice with a handful of salt. But here goes; 
---
I think "Classic" is a better game, regardless of nostalgia. Mainly becasue, compared to modern WoW, it's a challanging game that takes place in an open world for you to explore and have lots of adventures, meet friends and enemies, create a strong connection with your character and develop that character in a meaningful way through skills, gear, professions and other accomplishments. In short, there is no other game quite like it on the market today.
---
Modern WoW on the other hand will give you a similar experience to any other fast paced gear chasing game. I don't know which types of games you have played in the past, but modern WoW is more like a single player loot game, a raid simulator. Classic WoW is an MMO that requires time and exploration.
---
My advice is, try Classic when it comes out in the summer. If you don't like it there are many other games you can play, modern WoW being one of them. And that's the key here; Classic WoW is one of a kind, modern WoW is just another game. 
---
As someone said, 5ppl dungeons at 60 are not a challenge for experienced party. On private server I would even often go as DPS holy priest to Strat and Scholo, if the healer spot was taken.
---
Best advice to always have a spot in dungeons? Make some friends.
---
I think you mean one mob...

Malygos falls, deathwing senses his chance, breaks free from the maelstrom, cata begins begins. Combine cata with pandaria expansions, shrink pandaria somewhat, one people stop deathwing and the threats of pandaria, final raid is karazhan predicting the legions return. Dark portal opens, demons attack.
---
Players go to Outland to stop the demon threat and the threats to Outland, mistaking Illidan as the cause.
---
Illidan dies, now the one thing holding the demons at bay is gone, the burning legions forces use the power of the sunwell to raise the tomb of sargeras,
---
Players must go to the broken isles to stop the full return of the legion while attempting to undo the death of Illidan.  Shrink broken isles, use undermine and kultiras in this expansion. Lore wise, none of those 3 places have any business being full fledged continents.
---
Hardpass on wod and bfas story, make the legion homeplanet its own expansion leading into sargeras falling and the void lords coming to destroy azeroth, so bronze flight says gg we lose and rewind back to the beginning and we start over from classic

Remember that LAP didn't came until ZG patch (1.7).
---
Wrath had best world building and it showed what the game could've been like. However I also liked the design of vanilla where the world was huge and it felt like a long adventure with many diverse aspects.

Wrath had many issues with itself mainly in how they wanted to advertise endgame. The original 10/25 man design was rather poor in my opinion since in 10 man you got much worse gear but many encounters were of similar difficulty (so getting equal gear was very challenging for guilds who couldn't fill a 25 man roster - for which the 10 man mode was originally intended). It struggled with adding hardmodes in Ulduar which were very well received but for some reason scrapped for heroic modes in ToC (along with progression raiding getting scrapped entirely). When Ulduar came out you couldn't just skip Naxxramas and go straight from heroics into Ulduar because you needed gear from Naxxramas to perform well in Ulduar. This progression concept died with ToC. They went with a progression concept of normal -&gt; hardmode. This further followed by homogenization of gear leading to only item level being important. There was no incentive left to raid older raids. I'm not entirely sure either what Blizzard hopes to achieve by making mythic raiding 20 man only. It seems to me it would be more fun to make it smaller scale, which allows you to make mechanics more intense and at the same time classes more diverse in what bonuses they offer.  
---
SHotM is from enchanting. But it just requires it to craft (265), not equip, so you can drop it then if you wish.
---
always play what you enjoy. anything else is utterly stupid.
---
games are about fun, not about achievements.  
---
after all, everything in this game has been beaten already. min/maxing will only mean you beat old content sooner/easier then others.  
---
this game was solved 14y ago. don't fuss.
---
It's a small window for a guide. You'll have more "success" seeing what items are available in that level range than depending on other people. 
---
I've done a "twink set" on classic.db for my personal preference and it took less than an hour to find "bis" for the class I want. 
---
Find the gear available, enchant
---
It, and you'll have fun pvp with limited talents. 
---
&gt;  Druids can't res, so they are out unless we outgear the 5/10 man.
---
lul
---
Oh okay.
---
Have you ever browsed the WoW forums?
---
As a mage, I've always wondered what it's like to have an actual rotation
---
Yeah, vanilla wow was basically just that perfect balance of "hardcore" and "casual," and the perfect IP of course.
---
Whilst it's absolutely true that the playerbase which started out in vanilla have gotten older and have other responsibilities (I most certainly do), that's still a demographic that games. Out of all the people I knew who started playing WoW with me back in 2004 (around 15 people), none are still playing, all bar one have kids now, but all still play games. Any night I can pop on, check my Steam list, and see them playing anything from Ark to Vermintide to Skyrim to Total War: Warhammer. The last stopped playing WoW at Cataclysm. Interestingly a bunch of us went back to check it out at Cata, and within 3 months we'd all quit. We just found it boring. Leveling up was so mindlessly easy that there was no appeal. Dungeons were an absolute joke. 
---
The point here is that if WoW was still a good game, we'd all still be playing it, real life commitments or not. I still load up Heroes of Might and Magic III from time to time because it's a damn good game, despite being even older than WoW. Sure I wouldn't be playing WoW as much as I used to, and I'd definitely have to plan even dungeon runs with a lot more care since with a 5 year old in the house, I can't guarantee that I'll have time to commit. But I would still be playing. 
---
Energy timers are for beginners, a real.rogue matches his heart beat to his energy ticks
---
Enough "whats the big deals" and you end up with a shithole like retail. Is there a real reason not to implement it?
---
It was actually pretty awesome. You're ALWAYS regaining 20 energy per tick, even when full. So you get an addon that shows you the timing between ticks so you know exactly when to use your opener on someone so you can get +20 energy immediately after coming out of stealth. That's how you destroy clothies with ambush and an immediate backstab with the only delay being the gcd. 
---
Funny enough im 24 and have been playing since late 2006, early 2007 and i dont see the point in playing retail wow anymore. 
---
Why?
---
Because classic is the real fucking game. 
---
I might change my mind but they said warforging bullshit is here to stay and so hatred for retail will remain. 
---
Never mind the fact that overwatch has brought in a large chunk of the limp-wrested ninny types into the blizzard community and while they may try classic I dont think a large majority will stick around past level 40. Which is great because god damn do I miss the mid 2000’s gaming culture where everyone wasn’t an oversensitive other-kin. 
---
This is why I believe we *need* to go the route of OSRS, and before the classic playerbase dies down too much.
---
OSRS is still thriving like hell, and that's because of all the new content they put into it. I know it's hard to trust Acti-Blizz, but that seems to be what works. 
---
I believe that they should always keep at least one server true classic, but if they want to retain players in classic wow and keep their sub numbers up, this is what they need to do.
---
&gt;know what you can pull depending on your class 
---
And that's the thing. You have to actually think about something. Sure, learning the limits of your class is not exactly rocket science, but it's something that current players don't have to do. They can waltz through the world and know that nothing they pull is going to cause them issues. Classic required players to put some effort in to the levelling, and even though it was never a huge amount, that still counts. It makes levelling, question, fighting, everything really feel more impactful. Running across two continents to finish your Water Totem quest wasn't actually mechanically difficult, but it required a commitment from you to complete. Compare that to retail, where you just get skills for nothing. There's no sense of accomplishment, whereas I can still remember the feeling of relief and elation I felt upon getting my aquatic druid form back in classic. 
---
I love you, so very much for this reference. 
---
Paladins dont need mp5 in Vanilla.
---
If that's what qualifies as hard then every ARPG ever made is the easiest game in the world. That's just respecting the limits of my avatar, just like in some car games you can drive into oncoming traffic without crashing, in others you can't.
---
Yes, I agree, there was an actual sense of achievement, but Vanilla was still fairly casual, not by today’s standards of course, but even then it was never a truly difficult game, and anyone expecting difficulty will be in for a disappointment. I enjoyed vanilla, but especially as far as endgame content is concerned, every single expansion after Vanilla is MUCH harder. It was a very tedious game, but the best part of it was having people just as dedicated as you to play the game with and there has yet to be the same quality of companionship in a game that has outmatched Vanilla WoW. It is quite literally the best social game ever crafted and it is a shame that has devolved, but everything aside from the talent tree and gearing has been a massive improvement to the game. If they put what made Vanilla so delicious into BFA while keeping gameplay fresh by today’s standards, it would have 15 millions subs. 
---
Harder than what? For it to be harder than something it needs to be compared to something. Harder than Dark Souls? Harder than Mega Man 4?
---
&gt; Can someone who's never played still start the game? Or should I have done it 10 years ago and now am simply too late?  
---
Classic WoW is literally the essence of getting a second chance. You're not too late because the party is about to start all over again from the very beginning.  
---
&gt; Is classic wow a real thing? Or is there only one, modern version of it currently live?  
---
If you're asking "is this real life?" then yes, it is, unless Activision decides they want to kill a good thing.  
---
&gt; Is there (and should there be) a difference which WoW (classic or modern) a noob should start playing?  
---
Many of us have a bias on this question, so I will just say this: Nothing makes more sense than starting at the very beginning!  
---
All we want is Vanilla. Nothing more nothing less.
---
I'd say it was appropriately difficult for any yahoo to complete everything the game had to offer. It mostly had to do with knowing how stuff worked, the execution was fairly simple even when you reached the endgame.
---
Wanna explain more?
---
Lol who reads quests
---
You're not really hurt by it though? What about you? You experience the same content either way. 
---
I recommend. It aged quite well. One of the games that became pop culture. 
---
Even if you play it for 1 month, you only pay sub. Quite a lot of value. 
---
No childhood bias. I played classic when I was 20. And I always hunt for good deals. 
---
Can't comment on retail, I don't play this game. But I believe you would have to pay for the software as well and not only sub fee.
---
I say test bfa if you like it, before buying. 
---
If you are in naxx and raid a class you hate, you basically are asking for a disaster.
---
I did that with a paladin on a p-server.
---
God I hate that class now. Dont do it. 
---
alchemy is mostly  kind of useless (beside transmute) since you can get a guildy to make potions for you, herbalism can generate income and pay for engineering so some people go Engineer+gather or if it's a hunter/mage who can farm gold without a gathering profession they will go double crafting professions for the cooldowns like alchemy transmute, mooncloth/felcloth, arcane gems, etc.
---
It's really personal preference if you want to go gather + engi or double crafting for engi + expensive cooldowns. You could do either and still gain money from fishing or level an alt to farm gold.
---
No. I'm not arrogent enough to think, that my taste in games is the only opinion that matters. 
---
I'm sure there are people who like current wow. I don't want Activision to treat them, like blizzard treated me during wotlk. 
---
Knowing how an item is going to change is a big deal imo.
---
I think progressive itemization is a must, but I hope blizzard finds a better way to do it than pservers did.
---
Maybe not change current items after a patch, and instead only have new stats on newly dropped items? It would make people go back to farm the "new" items instead of just saving their old version in the bank until a later patch.
---
But anyway that would have the big downside of having multiple versions of the same item, at the same time. That affects immersion imho, and probably doesn't fit vanilla.
---
But having a shitty green in your bank until it becomes a nice blue item is stupid too.
---
If your only concern is raid balance then yeah, item progression is 100% the way to go.
---
vael doesn't start at 100% hp. it's like 25% or 30%
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=30787&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=45263
---
He spawns at [991,500 HP \(of 3,330,500\)](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Vaelastrasz_the_Corrupt).
---
Of course, there is never only one opinion that matters. But in terms of bussiness there is only one way that makes the most money. And if the Classic version makes substantially more money and the retail version is dwindling in subs and profit, it might be the best decision to let the classic version take over the role of retail.
---
I am not saying it has to happen or will happen, but its certainly a possibility. I for one dont like retail and would love to still go through all the expansions but with a different way of playing than retail has had.
---
You can assume if people don't directly compare classic WoW to a game, they're comparing it to Retail WoW
---
Pre-60 all dungeons are done with healers in dps specs. No one is leveling as a healer and no one is spending gold to respec pre-60.
---
Dungeons pre-60 are mostly quite easy. Especially since you almost always will have someone in the group that did it before and knows where to go / what to do.
---
If you go enh you might want to keep some int pieces you get from quests and drops in your bag. Doesn't have to be amazing and doesn't have to be a full set, just maybe a weapon + shield and a chest + legs or whatever you might have. It just makes it easier so you don't have to drink as often. Priest obviously run with int gear as shadow.
---
If you're playing a healing class, I'm pretty certain, you will almost always find a dungeon group. Healers are in high demand. Just make sure you have some healing equipment for a dungeon even when you're enh or shadow. Just play the class you think is cooler. Both classes will also be in high demand when it comes to raiding.
---
You absolutely miss the point. I am one of the people looking forward to classic, and I don't believe in the long term sustainability of a large playerbase. People have a very romanticized image of vanilla, either because of nostalgia, because of the way it's been praised over the years, or a combination of both. Vanilla was great for its time, but it has its flaws and is not catered towards the modern gaming habits anymore. A lot of the arguments that people currently have against BfA are in ways also true about vanilla, in some cases even more. And people that played in vanilla aren't teenagers or college kids anymore, they don't have the sheer amount of available time required to play vanilla.
---
The succes of private servers means that there's certainly a market for classic players, but there's also two things to consider. The first being that private servers don't require a monthly fee to play it. The second is that every large private server project following Nostalrius has followed a similar trend, which is to say an explosive overpopulated start followed by a steady but rapid decline.
---
The high profile nature of classic WoW means that it's going to attract even more attention than the private server projects do. But this also has a side effect. Where private server playerbases are people actively looking for this version of the game, thus being already hardcore players, classic will attract more mainstream attention. A lot of players will buy into the hype, but once the novelty has worn off most of these players will leave again. These will be people that jump into classic for a month or two to relive the old days (read: nostalgia) or experience a time in WoW they never got to, but these are not people that will play long term. Either because the reality will take over the romanticized image, or because they never intended to play seriously anyway. Because everyone who really knows vanilla knows what a timesink it was, and some people don't want to or can't invest that time anymore.  That's not "hating on classic wow", that's just being realistic. 
---
Ultimately I'm expecting classic to settle around a niche of players. A niche that's large enough to sustain the model (somewhere around 100 000 and 500 000 players, though it'll be hard to estimate due to its link to retail) but not anywhere near as big as some people seem to think. People who think that WoW will suddenly start growing again to numbers of 8 to 10 million like it in 2004 or even that it will overtake retail in the near future are just deluding themselves.
---
I actually took time and thought about what i would love to see after the regular classic content.  
---
To some degree i think you are right, wants everyone gets aware of "that's it", nothing new will come from now on, ppl. will spend less time on classic.   
---
My thought was, what if blizzard took the time and rolled out classic as they first wanted it to be (without the needed rush from that time). 
---
1. Implement Karazahn
---
2. Implement Caverns of Time  
---
\--&gt; from here on i am not sure if it fits lorewise
---
3. Get us to Hyjal as a zone as well as a Raid
---
4. Open Zul'aman
---
5. Open Sunwell, maybe
---
This is all content which would fit the classic world but would probably need some serious overhaul, but nothing which is completely out of scope.
---
&gt; I think WOW Classic is an objectively better designed game.  
---
I strongly disagree.  
---
I think WoW Classic and WoW Retail are objectively differently designed games, and neither has better game design than the other.
---
You basically gimp your raid with a bunch of fury warriors and a fury tank.
---
Add Recklessness aswell and there's your answer
---
Unless u have considerable experience most of the playerbase will look down on you, will be hard to get a core raid spot etc
---
Which is approximately a third of what OP used for his math when he figured people needed 3 times more dps. Funny how that somewhat works out considering the rather questionable math OP did.
---
Yes, he starts at 30% health,  but my understanding was that the 3.3 million was the amount of health you had to knock off. 
---
Otherwise,  to get inside the 3 minute timer with 30 DPS in you raid you need to achieve 185 DPS, and that's not going to be any kind of challenge: a mage can beat that by a fair margin naked, unbuffed and with no talent points assigned. That's not a boss that is going to cause anyone any problems 
---
Do you really want to devalue MC with DM loot/1.10 blues, ranking with Titanic legplates, and early pre-BiS crafting? 
---
Egan's blaster = BiS
---
Honestly? I think choosing your class in order to fit better with friends for *leveling* is stupid. It takes a lot of time to level, but once you are 60 you don't want to not like your class.
---
If you really want to choose for that it's best with a mage. Warlock is a prime leveler because of their pet and HP into mana playstyle but with both a tank and healer to level with you don't need that. Feral tanks instead of your pet and mana saving doesn't matter when you have to wait for your friends anyway. And portals are useful. Healthstones are not when you have a priest to heal anyway. Water / food as a mage will save all some money. Mage can also AoE farm, allowing for some quests to be done super fast or to grind at some levels.
---
But again, those things are minor. Honestly I don't think you'll think "oh man, if only I had more group utility while leveling" if you pick a Warlock. If you like the theme and playstyle of a Warlock, go for it.
---
If you have a trincket with 100 heal, it's probably your bis...but what if tank lose aggro and mob hit you? Its not your bis now. Bis is situational.
---
It catches up gameplay wise also.
---
I personally totally feel the difference in my attention to the game when I played for too long.
---
I'm 99% of the time a tank in dungeons, so having played for 10 hours straight, I do a lot more mistakes, mispulls.
---
I had times where I straight ran into an enemy mob group even though I wanted to stop. 
---
Playing refreshed on a saturday morning and going to the gym after lunch, returning in the evening is much better for my enjoyment in game than just playing away for too long.
---
&gt; I can sincerely say that a lot of people who have not played classic WoW will bounce once the nostalgia goes away.
---
How can they feel nostalgia for it, if they never played it?
---
ilevel was part of the main gui? Disgusting.
---
Water and food while leveling will be a huge time and gold save for everyone. Add in portals and polymorph... I personally think it's an obvious choice.
---
I may be biased though, as I personally play mage. End game can be boring if you let it be... But if you try to optimize and compete against the other mages for dps, most cleanses, etc. On fights, I found it very fun.
---
I wouldn't worry about not getting a raid slot, because the most important 2 things are that you know your class and can show up... If you can put a check in those boxes then you'll find a raiding spot. 
---
Warriors execute spamming and a tank with tfury and full threat gear would get you some insane results.
---
The official WoW forums or Retail Reddit are rife with those type of people. They literally complain about everything and nothing makes them happy.
---
I agree. That's the reason why people want classic back. 
---
If you cant sink the required amount of time into retail WoW, you cant do dailies, you will have to wait on catchup mechanics to kick in.
---
If you get steamrolled by a rank14 player in vanilla, you pick up 2 friends and nuke him 3v1 even as a lvl 58.
---
The discrepancy between characters and the power they gain during an expansion is just too high.
---
If you dont have time in vanilla, you farm AV and get the Unstoppable Force which has 61DPS. You wont get R14 weapon with 77DPS, but its good enough to hold up against people if you team up for wPvP.
---
In retail you just get roflstomped when you fall behind. 
---
Can you swap gear around in combat besides weapons? 
---
That's basically the case for every single boss if unchanged. They are universally going to be easy due to the itemization, player skill and resources available. When I was raiding I was 10 years old and often didn't bring bullets/arrows to raids, pretending to autoattack in a crowd of people. Even in that era I was a successful raider, lol.
---
Vanilla beats all expansions hands down. Sure some of the expansions included good additions, but overall Vanilla was significantly better.
---
With 1.12 gear warriors will have fast titanic leggings and all sorts of other +hit gear so they'll dominate dps immediately.
---
"is" actually and depending on class/spec secondary stats may be way less important tha "ilvl" :)
---
Playing as a meme spec and expecting to get to raid is just selfish. It's basically asking another 39 players to "pliz carry me and my sub-optimal arse".
---
Did you ever go outside?
---
&gt; Sure, learning the limits of your class is not exactly rocket science, but it's something that current players don't have to do.
---
I disagree.  
---
I cannot do on my Warrior what I can do on my Paladin, so he has to work with smaller pulls.  
---
For my Rogue any pull above 3 mobs becomes extremely dangerous, but she can at least stealth around the block, and avoid combat.  
---
My Hunter doesn't know what "difficulty" means, but my Shaman subscribed to the "no more than 4" club.  
---
Classes do play differently, but if you start an expansion with high-tier equipment from the previous one, the content will for sure feel trivial.  
---
Back in WotLK I was a hard-core raider with my mage, and I had lots of BiS pieces.  
---
When Cataclysm started, I capped my level quickly, and I didn't start changing my gear until I was already 84.  
---
Then I went on a hiatus, and I came back when WoD was already in his last year.  
---
I had to go through MoP and WoD both, and MoP felt "difficult", since I only had blue gear and a few reputation purples from Cata.  
---
I tried to speed through MoP, and I entered WoD with greens and blues, and it also felt harder than before.  
---
In WoD I played enough to get good gear, and when I started Legion I had no troubles.  
---
Enter BfA, and I had decent but not great gear (I didn't raid in Legion, outside of LFR), the difficulty was not excessive, but enough to give me some challenge.  
---
The vast majority of the fastest vael kills on private servers are all on "Server Group K", and the total damage done during the vael fight hovers around 1M. The fastest kill on "Server Group L" is https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=7564&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=8976 with total damage on that server group hovering around 1.2M. It's fair to say scripting is making a bit of a difference.
---
The real difficulty in Vanilla WoW was getting 40 people together to raid.
---
You are losing random people at the same time and you are threat limited. The threat limit is actually a bigger issue than the raw dps required, remember Vael was balanced around threat meters not existing (to no one's surprise guilds that started using Omen could suddenly reliably kill Vael). But the DPS increase from 1.12 stats/itemization is pretty large, as is actually having optimal raid specs. Just understanding how threat actually works is a huge DPS increase, for literally months in actual vanilla damage couldn't do optimal DPS because we didn't know if we'd pull agro or not. Being able to ride the 10/30 line is alone a massive DPS increase. Tanks understanding threat gear is a thing, as opposed to just surviving. 
---
I have an easy analogy here. Speedrunning. A single game is optimized over decades. Two decades ago maybe the best run for 100%ing a game was 6 hours. One new glitch or skip gets discovered and suddenly it is 4 hours. Today the game takes 18 minutes. Nothing about the game changed in that time period. I've never played on one but from talking to people who have I know they are inaccurate, but they aren't so inaccurate that anyone has any reason to think BWL will be anything but trivial. Vael's years of being a gear check will not return with classic. 
---
You have to knock out about 1 million HP. And you will most likely not have 30 dps, a normal raid would probably consist of 25 dps or so, only more if the raid is very good geared. Vaelstrasz has never really been a problem in terms of managing to kill him quick enough, its more about no one over-aggroing and mana users/tanks not wiping the raid, in addition to positioning the raid right to not be chain cleaved. Its a very unforgiving fight when it comes to those things, but the raid dps have to be very low before the timer becomes an issue. More guilds struggle with Razorgore to be honest
---
I was thinking about another timeline... 
---
Any advice then Shaman or priest? Which is easier to solo quest?
---
Or how about this: 
---
Moira Thaurissian falls into a magic trance caused by the trauma of seeing five fucktard weapons-for-hire storming and killing her beloved husband. Tappning into her own magic powers, fulled by her anger and the Dark Iron bond with Ragnaros elemental powers, she traps the ”heroes” in an alternate dimension in which she creates more and more powerfull monsters to kill of the murders. To her frustration, her unborned child meddles, beliving it is all a game, and starts creating cool weapons and awesome new skills. Lo and behold, the murderous scum some dare call the heroes manage to defeat the monsters and Moira must start anew. 
---
This would also explain how the expansions have shifted the storytelling to centrering eeeeeverything around your char (”All hail glorious worldsaver Lolgolas, protector of Life, the Sun and Creator of all nice things!”) wheras in Vanilla you were most often called ”Hey &lt;race&gt;, wanna collect pig foreskins?”. Would also explain all ridicilous weapons, Heirlooms, Legendairies etc
---
&gt;Either because the reality will take over the romanticized image, or because they never intended to play seriously anyway. Because everyone who really knows vanilla knows what a timesink it was, and some people don't want to or can't invest that time anymore. That's not "hating on classic wow", that's just being realistic. 
---
The thing for me is that I don't feel any obligations playing vanilla. You don't have to play *seriously* to enjoy it. Casually leveling for a couple hours a day while doing professions on a vanilla server was the most fun I've had in WoW since Wrath.
---
Strange things do happen when you meddle with time
---
This is glorious and well deserves the upvote
---
Not an expert on those classes, but I would say shaman. leather/heavy armor + healing + good in pvp.
---
Priest is very comfortable and easy to quest with, just power Word: shield + power Word: pain and a couple smites then wand to death. Its hard to explain fully. 
---
I suggest you Go to the YouTube Channel kargoz and view his in-depth leveling guide for Priest and Shaman, they will help you a ton! 
---
For example Dark age of Camelots classics pirateservers are still going, another one is opening and usually big successes. Put in context how much smaller that game was in its prime. People just wanna play the original game. considering DAoCs max population at one time was 1% of WoWs max population I understand that classic wow will be a huge success. Vanilla is in for a huge success and I cant wait.
---
That barely even classifies as a game. Why would you compare anything to that pile of junk? 
---
Fair enough, let me rephrase.
---
A lot of people who have played vanilla WoW in 2004-06, but have not played vanilla WoW on private server since (or other games on time-locked server so they know what to expect) will bounce once the nostalgia goes away. 
---
On the private server that I play we kill Vael in about 25-35 seconds if we have an optimal raid setup with many warriors containing naxx geared mains and with worldbuffs.
---
\*cough\* onyxia 3 man \*cough\*
---
Yes I was one of the officers on a server 1st guild in vanilla and despite that having a healthy roster and the constant recruitment was a pain in the ass. We had some really shitty players that we couldn't get rid of for various reasons and we still managed to kill everything in the game without minmaxing until the four horsemen stopped us. Who ever came up with the brilliant idea that you suddenly needed 8 geared tanks to progress further can go die in a fire.

My fun is gated behind your fun and if I dislike your fun too much to put up with it after a point I'm prohibited from having my fun. 
---
I'm not saying there shouldn't be progressive itemisation. Just that having to run the same 40 man raid every week for months on end to get a chance seeing the next one isn't fun.
---
I've beaten dark souls as a onebro so it's not like I'm against putting in effort. I just disagree with what the effort should be. 
---
&gt; Right now all we want is Vanilla. Nothing more nothing less.
---
Speak for yourself dude. There's lots of people wanting a lot of different things, heck even half the people saying 'all we want is vanilla' want a different thing to the other half. Months ago people were dying in the hill of '1.1 or bust'. Vanilla's a pretty loose definition, clearly. 
---
While i do agree ele shaman are the toughest for a druid to take down, it's not because he can "kite" him because you can't kite a druid.

Not bad for PvP if you've got some help killing the melee target. 
---
Vael is mostly about threat, and in 1.12 warriors have shield slam i think it is, that adds a lot of threat generation. In addition tanks now understand that they need "threat gear" and not just "tanking gear" as well for fights like this. Tanks generate more threat = people can do more dps.
---
Doing vael in retail vanilla i remember i had to hold back on my rogue, even though i was a sub-optimal spec with preaparation and had 2x vanishses, i still had to hold back DPS. When i did him on Nost i could go balls to the wall in full PvE dagger spec while only using vanish once.

you have a rotation:

1. Work from home with impeccable financial planning, 2. Have a life inside the game + outside (sports, going out, girlfriend that actually enjoys you playing games so she can get on with her own hobbies), 3. Pretend your working from home but actually be playing wow
---
I sometimes forget my life is awesome 
---
Well, when classic launches this summer, that would probably be one of the best times ever to start some iteration of wow, considering it will probably be the biggest “launch” of an mmo ever, and people will be starting in same place as you (well, minus knowledge), etc. 
---
Keep in mind, you’re going to see a positive bias towards classic when asking in these forums, but I’ll give you my opinions. 
---
Some people seem to not understand why someone would choose classic over retail. As if classic is just the older, shittier, game and retail has strictly made improvements, like graphics. (You will have to be able to accept older graphics for classic compared to modern games, unless they add a toggle option)
---
 The thing is, they’ve made so many changes over the years, they are just completely different games. They aren’t even really the same genre. Wow classic is what I think of a typical MMO-rpg. A huge open world where you interact with the environment and other players and has all the typical rpg elements where you spend tons of time to increase your level, learn skills, struggle to make money, work hard to find gear to make yourself stronger, notice the difference as your character gets stronger and can take on new things that couldn’t before etc. The retail version of the game has some of these components, but in a pseudo form. It seems more like it’s designed for players who don’t like the typical aspects of an MMO RPG and want quick rewards, without lots of effort, without having to deal too much with other people if unnecessary, etc. 
---
Like, in classic, leveling is supposed to be an important part of the game. And part of the game is supposed to be the fun of leveling your character, saving up to get a mount, exploring the world as you go. In retail, the lvling process is more of a burden they haven’t really been able to phase out because of the base game wow started as, where they now try to speed you through it, make it really easy, and you can just click a button and teleport to a dungeon from a city, so you don’t have to explore to level. And enemies level with you, so you don’t really feel like you are getting stronger, so you can just somewhat mindlessly press buttons that are your abilities to kill things like some arcade game rather than what would feel like true progression (to me).
---
If you like rpgs and mmos and are ok with idea of grinding, and care about things like uniqueness between classes, I’d say you might be more able to tolerate/hopefully enjoy the things in classic that retail players disapprove of. Some of the major things to me are:
---
-As said, things scale to your level (to some degree) in retail, while classic has more of a “progression” feel-if you try to attack a lvl 24 mob when you are level 16, good luck! A few days later, you’ll have no problem! And getting gear when you level is nice, because an upgrade isn’t just immediately replaced (you level much faster in retail)
---
-Flying mounts exist in retail, and not in classic. Actually flying was added in the first expansion Burning crusade, which was my favorite iteration of the game, and I don’t dislike flying as much as some. But flying was added with a specific expansion in mind, where it was kind of cool. Now that flying exists in the main world, Azeroth, etc. it kind of sucks. It ruins world pvp (although other things in retail already ruin it) makes the world feel smaller, etc. 
---
-LFR means you can just sit in cities all day instantly teleporting to dungeons with random people that are easy enough to clear it with strangers no effort at all. In earlier versions of the games, you actually experience the world because you travel to dungeons. And you form a stronger community because you have to find a group yourself to handle the dungeon with. And a lot of the content isn’t as dumbed down.
---
Related to lfg stuff, classic doesn’t have crossrealm interactions, you just deal with people in your community. So you get to know people. Even in pvp combat, bartlegrounds, you que and once you get in a game you will see the enemy faction players from YOUR sever on classic, and will recognize people, have rivalries, etc. with cross realms, you may never see the same people again, so it’s not as meaningful, and there’s less reason to interact or talk in dungeons. The advantage is faster que times.
---
Retail has class homogenization. To make things more “balanced” blizzard has had to tweak things so classes have more and more in common. This one of the worst things imo. In classic, the classes are really unique and different, even if sometimes imbalanced, and while balance is good, fun and unique classes is more important. I also argue classes can be balanced in different ways, like being good at one thing and bad at another. I’d argue all classes in classic have at least their own niche for something. 
---
Arenas were added in TBC (first expannsion). I actually like arenas, most classic fans seem not to. I like it because it adds a more high level skill based competition where someone can do well even if they don’t play a lot. I guess the problem people might have with it is that arena might be one of the things requiring the class “balance” blizzard has gone for in later expansions, that has resulted in homogenization. And that is has taken players competing in arena out of the world to interact with others in world pvp or bgs. I still wonder if this is sometimes a bias from people that are just bad at it. Although I’ve ranked highly so I might be biased in other direction. Again, TBC added arena, and that was actually my favorite version of the game (second being classic.) I felt the first 2 expansions, tbc and wotlk, balanced classes more while still keeeping them unique enough. 
---
Gear is more important and harder to acquire in classic. But people complained enough in retail version about inequality bs, now it’s easier for everyone to gear and differences are less severe for pvp and stuff. When everyone’s special, nobody is.
---
Raid fights (max lvl PvE end game with large group of people) might be more complex in certain ways in retail, 
---
Like bosses having more abilities, but I’d argue raids have gotten easier. I mean if you look at how long it took for guilds to first kills in vanilla and TBC compared to later expansions, it’s astounding. Granted some of that is because players knew less then, shitty Internet, the difficulty of getting 40 people together, etc., but I do believe things are made “easier” even if a fight is more complex. If a boss has 2 abilities in classic, everyone needs to play well and not fuck up or you die, and needs to have decent gear. In retail, it might be more like hey this boss has 6 abilities, and you have a dps rotation instead of presssing a couple buttons, but fucking up isn’t as dire, and all classes have solutions for when things go wrong, and raids aren’t tuned that tightly for gear, etc. gross oversimplification but that’s my take on things-first couple raids of vanilla will still be quite easy.
---
Actually, this list could go on, and I haven’t organized this great, but I want to stop typing. You can find more detailed lists in many places. Maybe one thing I want to use as a prime example: 
---
Weapon skill-in classic wow, if you have been only using a sword, if you equip an axe, your character will take time to use it well. You actually have level up your weapon skill, separate from your character level. So you might need to go fight some shitty mob, where you can be safe while swinging and missing, as you get more proficient with the weapon. This doesn’t matter so much for casters. In retail, you never to have to deal with this “issue”. But to me, this doesn’t sound bad at all. To most retailers, it sounds horrific and boring. The idea of having to level my weapon skill again is part of the idea of an rpg to me. Does that sound like something that would bore you? Maybe go retail. Or does it sound like something you would expect from the game, and that would give you satisfaction once you have leveled different weapon skills? If so, then maybe classic is for you.
---
Had an old WoW buddy try a private server for the first time a few days ago, the first thing he said to me when i logged on and he was level 7 or so was "Omg people are gonna rage so hard when they pull more than one mob, you just kinda die!"
---
He did play vanilla though, and cleared Naxx and everything, but he forgot how much more difficult vanilla was compared to retail when it comes to leveling.
---
Thanks for such a detailed answer. While reading it I felt like I could strongly relate, being that my main game for pretty much my whole life has been Runescape, which ironically, has also evolved, and people that loved it are back to playing the version from 2007 called Oldschool Runescape.
---
I don't much care about the whole 'fancy' thing, as I mentioned in another comment, Oldschool Runescape is so far the best game for me there ever was. Will sure have to try it out.
---
Well the rotation is actually browsing around on netflix on another screen looking for something to watch.
---
Hey guys, I really like this sub and can't await classic wow coming back :)
---
With this being said, here's my story and my question:
---
I started playing with release of wow in Europe. During classic I played a undead mage on Balnazzar-EU and I absolutely loved it. I was in a medium skilled guild, we managed to down Ragnaros and Nefarian but then somehow disbanded. After that I (and most of my friends) joined a new guild, where we started working on AQ40. I never really stepped into Naxx, but I had the attunement. Most of my time playing during classic I spent doing PvP (Rank 11 (or was it 10?) to get the mounts) and regular dungeons (Baron runs, UBRS, etc).
---
During TBC I switched to playing warrior (troll) and tanking instances. I was only in a small guild, and we only did Kara, Mag and Gruul. Most of my time in TBC I spent tanking 5-mans. In the end of TBC I started leveling a BE paladin. 
---
From Wotlk on this paladin became my new Main until now. My focus is still on doing (esp. tanking) 5-mans and some pug raids from time to time.
---
I also leveled every other class to max level during the last years. I really enjoyed everyone of them.
---
Right now I'm struggling to find out which class to play on the classic servers (as maybe most of you do too ;) ). Here are some of my thoughts/questions about which class to pick:
---
* Is paladin viable to effectively solo farm stuff (mats, etc)?
---
* How is his farming compared to a mage's?
---
* How is his PvP (in battlegrounds)?
---
* Is dwarf paladin a bad choice? (compared to human, with focus on PvE solo content)
---
* How is his leveling? 
---
As you can see I really fancy playing a paladin (could not do this during vanilla, because all my friends wanted to play Horde (and this I did until today ;) ). But I'm also wondering if I should play mage again (it was really awesome having portals all across the world, unlimited food supply and nice farming capabilites) or even switch to warlock or hunter?!
---
Thanks for your help, any comment/opinion is appreciated!
---
So if we discount the friends part which is more fun, obviously an subjective opinion, but I never really played either class, since I mained druid in Vanilla, I don't have any information. I will stick with whatever I picked, so if one a lot more interesting than the other?
---
Nice
---
Thanks for the answer. However, how far into the game is such content? 
---
Would I be able to just randomly wander around as a beginner for like a month? Or is raiding an important part of the game since the very beginning?
---
grats.
---
The subs are combined wtf are you talking about.
---
If you have a classic sub you also have a retail sub.
---
&gt; but at the same time classic is very limited in content. Once you reach 60 there are some raids and I guess you can farm reputation and a couple of other things, but for me classic is mostly about 1-60 and not necessarily the end game.
---
This right here is the problem. You make it sound like there are almost nothing after leveling because it fits your point but it's just a lie. Just because leveling takes longer in vanilla than retail does not mean it's the majority of the game.
---
Yes, retail have more frequent updates to content, but to many that is a flaw. I hate it when everything is so rushed, it lessens the impact of things like gear. I don't care about a super awesome drop if I know it will be ordinary in a week or two. Vanilla has a different pacing, that is *not* the same as lacking content. There are 7 raids in vanilla with a total of 65 bosses. Then there are world bosses, dungeons, rep and so on. Also remember a rep farm is far longer than on retail and you need to farm each raid way more to gear up. It's more repetitive and a slower pace, but that's a big charm of vanilla to many.
---
Yeah I have seen so many people differ in their wish for these classic servers.
---
Some people want balancing to be introduced, some want new raids, some want to just replay wow chronologically, etc. And others want 1.12 without any change, ever.
---
I am not saying any view on this is better than the other, but some will bring in more money and will eventually be necessary to keep the servers up.
---
Horde Warrior. Meters it would be Mage with Ignite but that is because he is getting credit for every Mage in the raid.
---
Bunch of nerds spitting nonsense 
---
They can still see which servers have more activity.
---
And I am not saying that the classic server *will* take over retail, I am saying I *hope* they do.
---
I can't give you any advice on Shaman as I've only played them to lvl10, but priest are incredibly fun and easy to solo level with. I levelled a priest to 45 ish and they have great solo power, good mob killing speed (not the fastest, but good), and if you accidentally pull two mobs, or even three mobs, you can usually dot them all up, power word shield yourself and nuke them down. You have a number of good, mana efficient heals, so often you can safe yourself if things go tits up. 
---
i accidently wrote ubrs, oopsie doodle
---
Raiding only exists at max level (60). From 1-60 you can quest or explore by yourself in the world, group up with a friend, learn professions, do 5 player dungeons, or fight players on the opposite faction. At max level, besides farming, pvp, and 5 player dungeons there are also 40 player raids, which require a bit more organization. I raided in bc and had a blast, but had a good time in vanilla even though I never raided. People will be leveling to 60 for months (some hardcore people will do it in 1-2 weeks), so you have plenty of time. 
---
It’s true that a lot of people will know the content really well, and the top guilds might not want some inexperienced player, but there will be more casual guilds too. And if you are willing to learn the fights and show up regularly, you honestly could probably still get into a not-that-casual guild. Plenty of people are wanting to experience vanilla raids that haven’t before (like myself). Plenty of people are also adults now with a job and kids that will have to play casually and not as hardcore as they were able to when they were a teenager.
---
And all I am saying is that the repetitiveness of end game in classic isnt necessarily a good thing and that new content will eventually be needed. Because if not enough people play it I doubt it they ll keep the servers up when they are only costing them money.
---
Depends if you are asking about personal DPS or raid wide dps contribution. Mage that has the ignite roll will do high af dmg but that dmg is thanks to all mages for example. Or the NF swinger might do less dmg than the "normal" hunter but if the dmg he adds due to the high NF upkeep in a caster heavy environment might make him beat the other hunter amtough not on the meters.
---
&gt; casual retail players this will still be a challenge, just because of vanilla specifics, like organizing and commanding 40 people
---
Come on, stop this. Retail players are millions of lightyear better than people were in vanilla. Commanding 40 man is like the flagship of why vanilla was "hard", but with 2 mechanics per boss that are easy to deal with it's hardly a challenge. Vanilla difficulty is made by gear and time needed to farm for consumables etc. 
---
I love this style of MMORPG, but don't try and say it's harder than retail, go play a mythic raid or mythic + dungeon and you'll see how laughable easy the mechanics are in vanilla. And if 20 kids randomly put together in a PUG can do retail raids I'm sure it's rather easy to get 40 men to read up on two mechanics.
---
This is why itemization is such a hot topic. Your counterpoint is there are other difficulties than gear, but there really isn't. If people outgear a raid it's easy. Kids will be able to do it with ease if they outgear the raid.
---
They were also sitting for all those crits. 
---
They should redo the video but actually have the duel and see what happens.
---
everybody seems to skip over a lesser known fact: tauren hitbox. 
---
**tauren melee range is 7 yards** instead of the usual 5 yards, and it goes both ways.
---
it's *fucking amazing* if you're enhancement and a major detriment if you're anything else.
---
so, based on the choices you've given... enhancement: tauren. elemental and restoration: orc, but it's a solid choice for enhancement too.
---
7.0 yards ≈ 6.4 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)
---
^(I'm a bot. Downvote to remove.)

---
No, I'm not retarded. 
---
Bet she thinks you’re nuts too x-D
---
In my book we are all nuts. Best to accept it and move on. No a life on which you can not play classic wow if you want to isn’t worth it IMO. Moderation is probably ok - but a few weekly raid nights should not be a problem!
---
You could say Mage in Naxx with rolling ignites yea, but I'm not sure that counts because you are pigy-backing on other mages Ignites. If you do count it though, you'll see mages with 3k dps on Loatheb.
---
If we dont count mages, the top DPS will be fury warriors.
---
The biggest issue is threat tbh, warriors have shield slam so they generate way more threat in MC and BWL than what they used to have, so people aren't as hardcapped on threat anymore. Lower threat generation and people can't do as much dps and the fights automaticly last longer.
---
shhh.
---
If I recall correctly the 3man onyxia was done at lvl60 in T3 gear but with the TBC pre-patch talents (which possibly could've made a difference).
---
That being said, I'm pretty sure there has been onyxia 5man or even 4man with 1.12.1 talents.
---
Okay, and then when you're in combat you're looking miles away from where your character is to see things you need to see. Have you looked at any UI in the last 10 years that isn't default? 
---
Game has a massive learning curve and requires a shitload of time, all the good players will rush 60 and acquire a massive amount of wealth making it harder for everyone else
---
&gt; **Can someone who's never played still start the game? Or should I have done it 10 years ago and now am simply too late?**
---
Remember when Vanilla launched most people had not played an MMORPG, or anything like it. Sure there were EQ players that went to WoW, but since WoW was the casual version of EQ (a really hardcore game) and it's suddeny rise to mainstream gaming means that the majority were new players. This time around the majority will know WoW, but many will only know the modern, which is a whole different game.
---
&gt; **Is classic wow a real thing? Or is there only one, modern version of it currently live?**
---
A real thing, it will release in the summer of 2019.
---
&gt; **Is there (and should there be) a difference which WoW (classic or modern) a noob should start playing?**
---
The two games are *very* different. It's like saying "should I play Mass Effect or The Witcher? Vanilla is not hard in terms of mechanics on bosses, it's not very polished, balance is weird (some classes are way stronger at dps, some are utility bots etc.), gear progression is much slower and so on. Modern WoW is more equal. All classes are viable, it's super easy to get gear, but it also get outdated faster. There are much more to do as well in modern.
---
Now, why pick Classic? Well, more content in modern are not necessarily good. Some find it boring and feels like chores to do. Slow progression on gear means it feels impactful, in modern some feel like gear doesn't matter when it is soon outdated. Balance in modern also means classes are way more alike and as a result has less flavor. Vanilla balance druid as an example, suck at raid dps - but their very special types of utility makes them *very* special to play in PvP, and quite strong.
---
Lastly, since the pace is so slow in Classic it means people often find fun things to do themselves. Player made events like raiding the other factions city or fighting the other faction over a world boss are some great examples of fun the players make.
---
Eh, raiding and pvp after Vanilla was actually good. The only thing Vanilla did better was leveling and even then I prefer Wrath. I can’t see anything else Vanilla could top out on besides the community. 
---
Thanks for such well constructed information.
---
As you mentioned in the other comment, at this point in life I could be a casual player at best with my current set of priorities, however I think I could still enjoy the game plenty.
---
From what you've said here, the game looks like it has many extremely in-depth mechanics and details which could be pretty difficult to grasp and learn. But this is probably something I am looking for. A game with endless exploration where interacting with other players whether it's trading, teaming up or fighting against is vital.
---
As you probably noticed from the other comments, my favorite game is Oldschool Runescape. It means I'm not all about graphics but rather gameplay that pulls you in.
---
Really looking forward to trying it out and hopefully enjoying as much as other people on this sub. thanks again
---
They share the same sub dude, meaning you don’t buy a classic wow sub or a retail wow sub. You buy a wow sub that counts for both games.If anything classic being successful and making a ton of money will just up the budget for retail wow.
---
I've honestly been thinking doing the same..not because classic wow is the main reason though.  But it'd sure be a lot nicer to have more free time to play it!
---
Did you think we had forgotten? Did you think we had forgiven? 
---
Reckon Thrall likes doing in dumpsters with bread rolls?
---
And who says they are smart? If they were, they would not have turned retail into a lazy consumer game for addicted brainless kids. Well, I guess it was "smart" to some degree, to keep them hooked and make more money. But they overdone it. There is no reason to think that the people who made those decision will suddenly understand what a good game design is and why it is worth it, in the long run.
---
Thinking about it, it is the same with socialism. Everybody knows it is stupid, but it looks good and they just can't help themselves.
---
I'm going to level a female undead warrior because I don't remember ever seeing one
---
no
---
By "organizing 40 people" I didn't meant actual mechanics in the raid, I  meant gathering up 40 people, all of them getting to raid instance without troubles, and no one leaving while raiding, because its generally longer than retail. 
---
Ofcourse mechanics in vanilla are simpler, why is it always "but muh mechanics are so complex in mythic!" arguments all the time. There are other things to raiding, not just mechanics
---
But if I go with your argument, with the fact that players are " millions of lightyears " better than in vanilla, than none of this matters anyways, everyone will faceroll old raids without any problems. 
---
Somehow I doubt this is the case. See, it won't just be old vanilla masters and current retail players, who will come back in classic - a lot of the players from wotlk-cata days will return (me included), people who didn't play wow in decade. I doubt they will crush old raids that easily
---
I know, but Blizzard can still see activity on servers. If classic starts generating more activity and thus money than retail or the other way around and the other is only costing money, do you think they will keep it up?
---
Yeah I’ll be grinding away all summer long working remote 
---
You usually carried 15 shitters anyways. You don’t need 40 people exactly if “someone leaves”
---
Horde EU pve here, looking forward to playong an orc warlock. The first thing I wanted to play when I read the manual during the old multi disk install. 
---
I tought so, I missunderstood what he said.
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
private servers, stats but ya. pick class: warrior. faction: horde / alliance, and compare.
---
Just do it!
---
*Make your dreams come true*
---
Ive been struggling with picking between OP rogues for pwning and a Warlock which is more fun leveling up and is satisfying in pvp.
---
My advice is focus on what you want. Dont think to hard about it. Just keep in mind every choice has consequences. You will have more fun playing how you want but know that if you want to be serious about raiding and progression you will be somewhat of a burden on the team. 
---
That being said, most guilds wont care, and you really dont need all 40 raid members at the top of their game for the first few raid tiers. 
---
You can always catch the second or third wave of raiding, meaning when everyone is focusing on AQ40, your guild wont mind taking along a meme spec to raids on farm. 
---
The best part about this game is that you can do whatever you want!
---
Back in the day as a super geared priest (like server first full T2 set) etc it was like that. People knew you and you got whispers to come to instances. Now in current private servers its quite the opposite. The just plain number of capable healers (mostly because of server size) means its quite hard to get into instances (where you actually want some loot). In most cases there are even enough tanks and you are looking for enough DPS'es. 
---
Some of that is because the group lead wont take the same class as he is to the group etc. So in those you need to know people and try just to run within your own guild. 
---
From what I've been told by my friends who played Run Escape, there are strong parallels between the situations with both games so you may feel right at home.
---
If she doesn't allow you to be yourself then she's not right for you. Simple.
---
Yday my gf saw me playing a brand new shaman on a pserv. She said: "but, what's the point?" And I didn't know what to answer, there is no point, we just play.
---
I think any argument that says one game is objectively better is wrong. They are two extremely different games and appeal to different people. Retail is stripped of everything that made the game fun **for you**- and for a lot of others. But there is also a portion of the player base that enjoys a lot of modern. BfA may be off to a rocky start but the game isn’t horrible either. It boils down to taste. Classic is slow, non-linear, and unintuitive. Modern is fast, very linear, and tells you everything. None of those are bad things! You can like and enjoy those elements without attacking the other side! It’s like trying to say Magic the Gathering is objectively better than Hearthstone. They’re both excellently designed games geared towards different audiences.
---
Nope. More content in the original style would be nice.
---
What I'd like:
---
New dungeons and raids that offer sidegrades and support different playstyles.
---
New professions.
---
Higher quality crafted gear.
---
Player housing.
---
Town clothes system.
---
Expanded talent trees.
---
More abilities acquired through quests.
---
More racial differences. Example, expanding the 2 Priest racial abilities system to every single class and race combo.
---
What I don't necessarily want:
---
Item level going above Naxxramas level.
---
Class revamps.
---
Cross realm shit (battlegrounds are a separate discussion) or LFR/LFD/etc.
---
&gt;same with some of the spawns in ZG
---
Mind control in ZG is a terrible idea. Half of the time the end result is a dead priest. We did it in vanilla, now, running much, much more efficiently i know you should NEVER do that again.
---
At least one of the druid tier sets has stats for both balance and feral, there's quite a few weapons like that too.
---
&gt; Is it not common knowledge just how good this talent is despite the incorrect tooltip?
---
I NEVER leave home without it. Hands down most important talent for a warrior.
---
Hnnng.
---
I remember when i discovered that back in BC on my warrior first time around. I wanted it so bad but only ever got one piece after dozens of runs. The times the other piece dropped somebody else won it fair and square :c
---
I often stared at other warriors with envy... it was so cool T_T
---
&gt; Run Escape
---
Gimme dat Carrot on a stick!
---
As someone who is middle aged, played with a shit ton of legos as a child and has purchased lego sets for my two sons....................... the new lego sets ARE FUCKING AWESOME!
---
I also bought a few Lego Architecture sets that sit on my desk - like the NYC skyline for example.
---
TLDR: what you wrote sucks.
---
the point would be to keep inspiration on the tank
---
Freedom to grind to your hearts content. A good choice.
---
For me there's no problem postponing the launch ***if*** we get to play a beta before the official launch to make sure that everything is smooth and to test the initial zones to see if sharding would be needed.
---
This is not entirely true. For any binary spell the hit chance is calculated by (spell hit chance)*(1-(average resist chance)), which means more spell hit will help counteract the resist chance. So 5/5 shadow focus will help against the paladin aura if you try to cast a binary spell like silence or fear.
---
No. I was simply pointing out that you should (and will) eventually get gear that happens to have alot of stamina. For example the blue pvp set (rank 10). 
---
So if you survive getting stuck in a trap, then get aimed shot from his max range, while the pet is biting your ass, you should be able to get an intercept off, hamstring and melee him down. 
---
(back to your original question)
---
If you have alchemy, you can drop a invulnerability potion (after the aimed shot for example), or a health potion, or a swiftness potion. 
---
If you have engineering, use net trinket, grenades and even a gnomish death ray. 
---
&gt;Vael is mostly about threat, and in 1.12 warriors have shield slam i think it is, that adds a lot of threat generation. In addition tanks now understand that they need "threat gear" and not just "tanking gear" as well for fights like this. Tanks generate more threat = people can do more dps.
---
Tanks are now 2-h FURY spec, dont use shields and pop Death Wish on pull. Our last kill was 34 seconds (BWL+ZG geared), main tank did 1000 dps. First 4 fury warriors were in the 2200-2000dps range.
---
I meam, this forum is not even remotely representable for even the average private server player. The most hardcore guilds will always be elitist/min-maxers, just like they were in vanilla. Most guilds will not. Gold farming tactics will not break the AH, most people arent good at it even with all the information out there and dynamic spawns. Only thing that gets a bit fucked up is the prices on things needed for newly patched enchants etc, but that normally stabilizes rather quickly. 
---
My guild just killed C'thun for the first time on relatively popular blizz-like private server. Guess what we had in our raid composition? 1x Boomkin, 2x feral druids, 1x retadin and several people still wearing greens/blues. Vanilla is pretty forgiving in terms of raid composition, atleast up until Naxx. You might not get speed run records, you might wipe an extra time or two, but having sub-optimal specs in the raid sure as hell won't keep a guild from performing well in raids or from progressing. When most guilds are casual and chill on private servers, you can only imagine how many more will have that mind-set in classic.
---
Troll Warrior
---
Vael starts the fight at 30% health, that 3.997.200 is her TOTAL maximum HP. So like on ND the actual damage needed for the kill is around 1.2M.
---
&gt;On ND our last kill had us do \~1.2M damage on the kill. And that lines up exactly to the 3.99M total health he refers too.
---
Just a difference what he refered to in his post. Is it 30% of 3.3M or 3.99M HP. K's have it at 3.3 and L's have it at 3.99M.
---
Classic doesnt need new content. There are servers that exist for 6+ years and they are still pretty active. J. Allen Brack literally said it doesn't matter how many people play Classic. They will make the dev costs and server costs for the next 5 years in the launch week, so it's very doubtful they lose money even on the long run.
---
In modern WoW you don't even need to stealth to kill mobs. You just rush in and 5 seconds after you're done.
---
I have struggled with this. I was a feral pioneer back in the vanilla days. Then I made a choice to spec resto in order to be able to heal BWL, AQ40 and Naxx. It turned out to be the right choice, because I got to experience the toughest raid dungeons in vanilla. Not to mention that as the average player base gets better gear, the harder it was to burst down people in pvp with the same blues I had for a year. 
---
I would honestly say: Enjoy the leveling experience as much as you can. As a ret pala, enh shaman, feral druid, shadow priest the 1-60 experience is your "carefree youth", where everything goes. Once you become an adult (60), you have to make choices that will have consequences. Do you keep your "meme" spec, or do you do what the rest of tryhards expect of you in order to see the inside of Naxx in over 1 years time?  Completely up to you. I personally will enjoy my feral experience 1-60 in classic and then Ill go deep resto until I kill Kel'Thuzad. 
---
As to the race/class "dilemma", this is something that really wont matter. People say it will, but it really doesnt. The best guilds in vanilla got world firsts despite having non-meta combos in their ranks. If youre a good priest, being a dwarf or not wont matter. If the success of your raid depends on you being able to cast fear ward, then that raid has bigger issues. 
---
Dont compromise race. Your character's unnappealing looks (to you) will never go away. Trust me, I know. My first character ever was a Tauren warrior and I hated the way he looked to the day I rerolled as a NE druid. 
---
Lets remember that blizzard made classic, because they saw the massive amount of people playing private servers. Those people dont have any wrong ideas what the game is about. Those arguments can ONLY be used against a retail player that has never experienced vanilla. They might start the game and quit before hitting level 25. **But heres the kicker, nobody fucking cares if they quit.**
---
Blizzard knows the demand for classic, they made to cash in based on the private server scene numbers. If some retail player that has quit picks up sub again, its just a bonus for them. It also gives current retail players additional content between their expansions.
---
I dont mind if they postpone the launch to improve quality, but i don't think they will. Im interested more about when will they launch 8.3 compared to classic.
---
 Im guessing at blizzcon 2019 they will talk more about new titles then improvingments to older ones but anyway they have their work cut out to make people attend it. 
---
Nostalrius captured lightning in a bottle. None of the pserver projects before or after have had the same kind of community diversity which is what most people long for in a vanilla reincarnation whether they know it or not.
---
If anything nu-blizzard launches too early.
---
The people who were part of the ‘its ready when it’s ready’ side of things are all but gone
---
Alliance?
---
Welcome to the singles' club! You get to do what you want when you want. It's pretty great.
---
Nothing does damage.
---
Theoretically this is the answer.
---
A mage could theoretically have an ignite never end if they kept getting crits. 
---
Honestly, dont even watch any guides or anything and just soak in the experience of vanilla wow. Personally, min-maxing etc ruins the fun for me. I do and pick whatever I find the most fun / interesting.
---
The only time I would even consider checking out guides would be at lvl 60.
---
&gt;Holy: 100% mana back from crit heals, at high gear levels didnt have much mana issues (I remember chain healing for 3-4 minutes straight on some of our first patchwerk kills)
---
Not to mention you can stretch out your mana a ton with consumables combined with BoW. Major mana oil, mana regen elixir, some mp5 gear. World buffs add +18% crit, And top of that cheap mana pots and in case of emergency runes. 
---
&gt; because she is fucking nuts. 
---
So you are saying the sex is great. Got it.
---
Yeah... for me, fucking nuts is a deal breaker.
---
It would be far worse for them to rush it in an attempt to make a specific release date. You can see the fallout of that on retail.
---
Technically it slows rage decay *by* providing one rage every 3 seconds. The mechanics for the ability are the same in or out of combat. 
---
Being in combat means that it's +1 per 3 sec insetad of +0 because your rage is not decaying., Being out of combat means it's something like -2 per 3 sec instead of -3 because of the +1 rage per 3 sec.
---
How the fuck would I even know what gear the top character has? 
---
also, the aesthetic look of that gear makes me excited as hell
---
It matters because many talents are clearly dead talents. Useless noob-traps that don't benefit you in any way, and even sometimes hamper your ability to enjoy the game.
---
My only experience is from leveling Paladins, but I can tell you that there are plenty of talents and builds that actually hurt you, rather than help you, like taking Anticipation, which gives you more Parry + Dodge, hurting your ability to proc Redoubt and Reckoning. 
---
If Classic talent trees were as well designed as they were in TBC this wouldn't even be an issue, but Classic is... it's *unfinished* to put it nicely.
---
Also, I've already leveled on p-servers, so I know what I'm getting into :D
---
fuck the horde?
---
You should try calculating the damage with a rogue or warrior rather than a mage. The extra damage you can do with unlimited energy/rage is very impressive.
---
Rend-Hamstring kite is quite chill. But when doing it a swing timer is helpful. You can get anger management for nice dual pull kills with sweeping strikes etc. Dont have to sit much since you take way less damage. You can kill higher level mobs without burning all your CD's. Its great for PVP too.
---
Use Piercing Howl. It's a very useful spell for a class that isn't mobile. Slowing multiple enemies down with aoe is a godsend and you're gonna be using it a lot
---
Yeah, it's funny how people often claim that the game is easier now because everything has been figured out. While that's true, on the other hand we have all this rampant misinformation floating around from people who want to cash in on YouTube.
---
Horde
---
Doesn't matter if they postpone it or not, I've waited 12 years for this I can wait 3 months more.
---
I hope they decide to postpone it if its not finished.
---
That ring is fucking amazing. Had it on my priest on a private server. But lets be honest, you arent going to use that in boss fights (since you will get some splash damage). But its OP in 5-mans, great in trash. The thing is, if the shield fails. Just put on another ring for the remaining CD.
---
Arms is super easy and super chill.
---
I'm really looking forward to Classic, but statements like this:
---
&gt;you have to actually think and plan out your character as well as work with other players in order to succeed (while levelling)
---
Are absolutely not true. You can successfully level up to max level in a fairly reasonable amount of time on your own without ever grouping up. That's what made WoW so casual compared to the other MMOs from that time. 
---
&gt; WOW Classic is an objectively better designed game
---
Also not true, it's very subjective. Retail does some things better than Vanilla and vice versa. It's all about how much weight you put on those differences. You think complex raid fights might not be important to you, but for high-end raiders it's surely a very important aspect of the game. Personally, I love meaningful leveling content like complex quest lines or class quests to unlock certain abilities, but there are enough players nowadays and also back in the day that view leveling and related content as a chore only. 
---
Ofc there are things that even I would put as objectively bad like the obvious emphasis on micro-transactions in retail or never-ending treadmill mechanics instead of clearly defined goals. But on the other hand vanilla also had its objectively bad design blunders like non-viability of many specs for raiding or some "features" that strongly encouraged breaking of the TOS via account-sharing like there not being a guild bank or the honor system that required you to play 12+ hours every day.
---
While I liked Legion very much, I think BfA was a huge turn for the worse and I'll like Classic much better. 
---
But the point is it's all subjective. 
---
The biggest reason it's easier this time around is 1.12.1 talents.
---
They make warrior so many times more powerful.
---
Wtf are you talking about, ofc we do. Stack as much as you can in trash, tbh. Its quite essential for any kind of effective fast raids. Sure, you might want to do \~max +healing on bosses but would be stupid not to use example that ring.
---
When early on your alternative for 2nd slot is +18 damage ring from saving princess.
---
That's what I'm thinking, especially since it really seems all these p-server guides that went all-in on /sit Fury builds are going to be extinct.
---
How consistent *is* Fury without the ability to force crits, anyway?
---
If you're in a hardcore guild you dont really have to play much to clear naxx tbh. 2-3 raid nights a week at most (for the first couple of weeks of Naxx), experienced players wont have to spend much time farming either
---
[Been there, done that](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7kuopl/things_you_really_didnt_know_about_vanilla).
---
Aren't I married to Fury at that point? Or should I go 11 points into Fury and then the rest into Arms?
---
Don't stick your dick in crazy
---
They discuss that in the recent classicast, maybe you heard it. It‘s put in point quite well, just because you know how it works, it doesn‘t make it a lot easier 
---
Honest mistake, this happens like 50% of the time, if it was a pug don't sweat it.
---
If this was a guild run blame leader.
---
In early levels they do matter  guess? Dwarf and trolls differ 10 agi, so if you're a troll hunter you 're basically wearing a trinket that says '+10 agi' permanently compared to a dwarf. That's not bad at lvl 1. Wouldnt be surprised if trolls have a slightly easier time getting 1-10 this way. 
---
But in the long run it doesn't matter since +10 is nothing at high levels.
---
Fury has more damage output at the end of the day.
---
[wolfshead helm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345)
---
you constantly shapeshift and get energy to deal more damage
---
[Manual Crowd Pummeler](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9449)
---
for the attackspeed buff, but it has limited uses
---
Are you basing that off being able to /sit macro your way to constant Enrage uptime?
---
Because that's not going to be a thing anymore...
---
oh well, technically my link is older ;)
---
Not particularly, but enrage is still a useful trait. Especially in world pvp if you fancy it.
---
If you're speccing fairly deep into fury you might as well finish it with Bloodthirst. No reason to jump between the two.
---
Right, but since all modern guides are based on private servers bugs, like /sit macros inflating the value of Fury for leveling, what will the game look like once you're unable to exploit that mechanic? 
---
Is Fury *really* more damage output once Bloodcraze / Enrage / Flurry proc far, far less than is currently possible?
---
Uhm... fires still deal damage.
---
they are both pretty equal pre40
---
differences are minor and more about personal preferences
---
Jaina recommends a horde char? Mmmhhmmm
---
Seriously, if you have a Girlfriend that prevents you from Gaming you really should get a new one. 
---
I never understand how people can get Girlfriends that do shit like that. I'd rather be single forever than have a Girl that has nothing in common with me and is nothing more than a fucktoy that talks back.
---
That's one of many opinions. 
---
going dw fury with maces/axes is chill (they are cheap as heck since rogues only use swords and warriors all level with 2h) 
---
hamstring kiting might be superior but you can chain grind so fast with 2 blue one handers
---
I've leveled a total of 5 warriors on (blizzlike) classic servers and while 2h is the best in terms of cost and pvp going 2x1h fury was the most fun time I had leveling a warrior
---
We may never know until we get to play the actual game, but a safe bet is to spec into fury at launch imo, with a good reason being piercing howl as I mentioned
---
Grats dude!
---
My gf has nothing to do with video games and she just let‘s me have my time playing whenever I want. It should be this way or no way I guess?
---
I think it's possible that some people can have more to their life than gaming. So if you love someone who you have 99% of everything in common, but the 1% is gaming, some people would consider that acceptable because they have more going on in their life than games.
---
How the fuck is every Guide saying something differeNt? 
---
You ALWAYS go 2H Fury until 40! Then you either respecc 31 Arms or keep leveling as 2H Fury until 60. 
---
Rend is difficult, I only use it on harder Mobs where I'm sure it uses its full uptime. 
---
The Builds are pretty obvious:
---
[31pts Fury](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZE0zIMxoVo)
---
[31pts Arms](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdIio0u)
---
What you are asking about,current Blizzard cannot do. Let classic be classic and if it gets lots of players, then release TBC/WOTLK. But only if there is always a classic server and enough people so the community won't be split too thin.
---
Ignite Mage with 5times Pyroblast ignite proc, and with 100% uptime of that ignite.
---
sad
---
Without the /sit stuff 2h fury is still perfectly fine for L1-39 imho. At L40 just go arms and get MS. Just do it. It's so bloody good for leveling.
---
Gaming is more than 1% of my life. If a Girl doesn't want that I play Videogames she can be perfect in every other way, its not going to work!
---
&gt; You ALWAYS go 2H Fury until 40!
---
From what I understand this only became a meme because every private server has always had the easily exploitable /sit macro to keep Blood Craze / Enrage / Flurry up for an unBlizzlike amount of uptime.
---
That's why some old guides (from actual Vanilla) suggest different leveling builds, and some new posts that take into account a lack of /sit macros are starting to suggest going Arms instead...
---
a lot of people hating on classic are just scared that the main game is going to die. which it unfortunately will, after everyone realises how much better the game was 15 years prior.
---
Fury warrior in bis doing execute spam against a boss that a tank can maintain the highest possible threat against, or a mage rolling ignites. It's the same answer across the board because they're both insane numbers.
---
That's pre-Theramore, she + Thrall, you know.
---
Yes, because mine is a reddit post having copypasta'ed your link. One year ago.
---
hope you gave credit to the MMO poster!
---
I never or very rarely used the Sit Exploit. Arms is crap until you get MS! In Fury you have Blood Craze, Piercing Howl, Enrage and Deathwish at 30. In Arms you have Tactical Mastery, Imp Overpower and Sweeping Strikes.
---
If you want to get to 40 as easy as possible 2H Fury is clearly the better Choice. 
---
What is the relevance of a TOP NAXXRAMAS GEARED guild killing the second boss in BWL? There is ZERO relevance, and itemization also have ZERO relevance.
---
It is like making a case that a 5 men dungeon is easy because 5 fire mages geared in T2-T3 are killing everything in 2 seconds.
---
There is no new strategy.
---
It is like using an F-16 against a Me 109.
---
Overgearing is NOT bad itemization. Never was, never will.
---
There is also the point of weapon skill. Yes, Arms with  Tactical Mastery  is good vor Tanking but if you 2h while leveling your 1h skill can be to low to tank.
---
Arms 2h with out swingtimer is maybe not even better then DW until 40
---
I'm far from knowledgeable on the subject, but I found getting the +5% crit from fury and then doing a deep Wounds build in arms to be pretty chill. I never bothered kiting but there's something really satisfying about fishing for the crit and the seeing your damage skyrocket as the target bleeds out. Never took it past early 30s, but I don't see why it wouldn't work late on.
---
as a rogue this feels fucking terrible. After Vancleef sword I don't get anything except maybe the butcher but I'm poor on a new server. Also quest rewards are almost never damn 1h swords
---
fuck levling hunters, so many hunters destroy my rogue without really doign anything
---
While you're absolutely right, this isn't something that's stopped them in the last decade.
---
Well, if it matters, play arms, 2h, and go for the weapon with the highest dps (staves are weapon.) starting from lvl 40 try to go for the slowest weapon possible. 
---
They do.
---
Arms you got deep wounds too. You take the 5 crit from fury then go arm, and respec at lvl 40.
---
Go arms trust me it's just easier and better coming from a guy who also likes to lazy/minimal actions low effort quest. Rush Tactical mastery so you can actually change stances without wanting to kill yourself 
---
Very consistent I would say, having lvled about 4-5 fury warriors. 1 in retail vanilla and the rest on various private servers. My only recommendation would be: Go Arms or 2h fury. Once you reach lvl 45 and get Thrashblade from Maraudon you can go dualwield if you prefer but I would still recommend keeping arms or 2h-fury all the way to 60.
---
Personally I'd play Arms then and make sure you get 2/2 Imp Overpower. Get a nice phat 2H and when it procs, which is will almost every fight - boom, you've got your big damage.
---
3/3 Rend, 2/3 Imp HS
---
2/2 Imp Charge 3/5 Tactical Mastery
---
2/2 Imp OP
---
Go from there. Probably get Anger Management then Cruelty. Then up to Sweeping Strikes. Could go for SS before Cruelty though.
---
I usually swap to Fury about 45 once I've got both Sword of Omen and Vanquishers. I basically grind one mob at a time, only 2 if I have to. Fury is so frustrating imo early on as you miss all the time and have to maintain 2 good weapons, so it's harder. Blue 2H are easy to get early on as Alliance anyway. Smite's Hammer.
---
This is what I'm thinking. Do you think it's worth it to get Cruelty first and then aim for a Deep Wounds / Impale / Overpower thing?
---
There's one in feralas at like L48ish, but by then if you're lucky and get a group you can get thrash blade from mara instead. Then there's a mace in un'goro and a sword from wpl. But yeah, it's very difficult to find a good sword outside of drops from instance bosses.
---
No exact number, but I'd put it somewhere around 20-40% for MC. All the little things just add up multiplicatively, and there's probably things we haven't even considered, for instance, chain heal gets buffed part way through Vanilla so that it's target selection works way better.
---
&gt;her
---
wat
---
yeah but the 20-40 mark is incredible. I'm leveling with my brother which is also rogue and we are both lvl 35 starting to struggle to get a new sword. This might actually change my decision to roll double rogue on classic
---
I second this. TBH I am kind of disappointed that they announced a release date given the state of the demo at blizzcon. I would have preferred they maintained the stance "its done when its done" so they could give the game the time it needs.
---
It has been broken on private servers. It may not be on yours
---
It’s not really about that.  You don’t have to do everything together and if someone won’t allow you to do the things that you enjoy that’s a symptom of a much bigger issue.   Granted that doesn’t mean your SO has to be ok with you no lifing some game for weeks or months on end, but your partner should be supportive of the things that you enjoy within reason wether they enjoy them or not.  
---
My wife isn’t into gaming at all, but when a new game comes out that I’m excited for she is happy for me and gives me a little space to enjoy my hobby.  When Legion launched we did have to have a conversation because I was way too into it and she felt neglected, but after talking it out I saw her position and dialed it back some and everyone was happy.  
---
I’m a firm believer that your common interests don’t have much to do with the success of your relationship.  Sure, you need some common ground and things that you enjoy doing together, but the real defining aspect from the perspective of longevity is how you handle the things you don’t understand or enjoy about the person you are with.
---
Claw of Chromaggus OP!
---
Why isn’t warlock on here...?
---
If the 1% is gaming, then there is respect for personal space and development in the other 99%. Somebody who can't live with you, because he/she can't understand and accept an aspect of your life, will not be part of a health relationship in the long run.
---
No just rush tactical mastery and anger management, you will get 5% crit chance from axe spec anyway by the time you get MS. and your overpower will crit all the time anyway 
---
A permanent 25% increase to armor for the main tank doesn't sound anything close to retarded to me at least.
---
I've been playing through two TBC servers now with the same guild and one of the first things we do is make multiple groups with 1 alchemist in each to farm Old Hillsbrad for the Ironshield Potion recipe, which has a very low chance to drop.
---
The first alchemist who gets that recipe instantly goes potion master, because it's such a powerful potion for any tank in the game.
---
It gives you 2500 armor for 2 minutes, which is something like a 8-10% damage reduction from boss attacks. During progression that helps immensely when your tank has a lot lower chance to just randomly die to a big hit.
---
My point is that the buff you get from Inspiration is usually better than the Ironshield Potion, a consumable you get 1 expansion later in the game at level 70.
---
There's certainly a point to keeping it up on the tank at all times. Even during TBC I'm always spamming rank 1 Healing Wave on the tank if I have nothing else to heal just to keep the armor buff on them because it's really important.
---
I don't get it.
---
\&gt;    I believe it wasn't until TBC that LT was affected by Spell Power 
---
Correct but e.g. Demonic Sacrifice 15% spell power buff increases the mana you get from life tab, as it is considered a shadow spell
---
Where do you guys find all these 'classic haters'? Seriously, I have not seen or met a single person who hates classic. Some say it's not for them and that is fair enough, but that's maybe 5%. The other 95% are either hyped as fuck or are very positive about and will probably try it out. You have to be actively looking for those few guys who seriously hate classic just so you can get all up in arms and rage about them and tell everyone again how shit retail and the retail players are.
---
People on this sub are fucking weird. Why are you so obsessed with retail? Classic is obviously better than retail hence why we are here... no need to constantly talk about retail and tell everyone how terrible it is and that retail players want to ruin classic. 
---
You'd think people who are awaiting the re-release of a 14 year old game would be a bit more mature, but this sub is fucking childish and toxic.
---
&gt;people often claim that the game is easier now because everything has been figured out
---
I think people say this more about endgame PvE than leveling.
---
beautiful.
---
So Clarification, Fire does damage, the difference is, certain damage doesn't break stealth, such as falling damage and damage from camp fires/lava. In Classic, all damage you take breaks stealth, misjudge a fall? well stealth is broken and you're probably going to die from all of the mobs around.
---
Be mobs in Molten Core?
---
Are there any items from Alchemy that require actual alchemy skill to be used which I should know of?
---
Also, thanks a lot for the time invested to the answer. Much appreciated.
---
orc warrior
---
Whatever spec you want to play, make sure 11 in Arms for Anger Management is your first goal. Nothing helps more than that talent as it ticks 1 rage per 3 seconds IN COMBAT in addition to the out of combat slowdown.
---
I'd suggest 2/5 defiance, 3/3 imp Rend, then 5/5 Tac Mastery and AM. Then get Deep Wounds and Impale unless you plan on hitting one of the other two trees.
---
Rend is really good up to about mid 30s and you should use it as your first attack on everything. It's only as you get close to 40 that it starts dropping off in power and becomes less vital (though I think it's still always a better use of rage than heroic strike provided it ticks for most of its duration). 
---
By the point Rend stops being super good though, the Deep Wounds/Impale talents start kicking in. Improved Overpower is also a fantastic levelling talent, especially combined with Deep Wounds/Impale. It doesnt matter whether you're fighting with dual wield, 2h or 1h/shield, you'll level mostly in Battle Stance for charges and Rends and that near-guaranteed crit is superb. 
---
At 40 you should either keep going down arms for Mortal Strike, or fully respec to 31 Fury or 31 Prot depending on what you fancy (Prot levelling is slow but relaxing and safe, and isnt too slow once you get shield slam as long as you keep a good mainhand). From there, go back to Arms and get 11 again for Anger Management, then do what you like!
---
You can really level however you like as Warrior, just remember that you really want to have 31 in one tree at 40 for the big hitting skill of each tree, and if you mixed and matched en route to 40 you can use your first mega cheap Respec to change. 
---
Just make note that Anger Management is superb for levelling far beyond what the incorrect tooltip says.
---
Yep, my right hand is also exactly like that!
---
I agree with most of this but definitely aim to get Anger Management at 11. It's one of the best talents warriors have as it ticks up 1 rage every 3 seconds IN combat in addition to the out of combat reduction. 
---
Yeah, but modern WoW isn't failing like modern Runescape did. So why would they go back to an ancient version of the game that, lets be honest, only a small portion of the playerbase really like. There are plenty of people who like certain things about it, but the amount of people who like vanilla WoW *the most* are fairly few. 
---
Most people would much rather have TBC or Wrath than they would have classic, for example. 
---
I believe it does damage but doesn’t break stealth 
---
You mention MC and BWL but Warriors had Shield Slam in BWL in retail yk..
---
Very simple answer.
---
Enjoyment.
---
If you enjoy levelling a shaman and that's what you like to do, that's good enough to do it on your free time. It doesn't need some long, complex explanation of why you do it if you just simply enjoy it.
---
In theory you dont need to be an alchemist to use these potions, but at the same time, always having one of them for every single fight will be very very expensive. 
---
My pleasure, were all killing time waiting for the summer.
---
Buffing raids to make up for the 1.5-3x (depends on the raid) increase in raid performance between 1.1 and 1.12 would only hurts the weaker specs even more as a lot of them are awful simply because they run out of mana.
---
Imp Overpower with Deep Wounds and Impale is absolutely sick. Arms also gets Anger Management which generates more rage in combat than 5/5 Unbridled Wrath. Sweeping Strikes lets warriors actually take on two mobs at once. Blood Craze and Enrage are dependant on being crit and you cant /sit to proc them. Heck even improved Rend is superb early on as this is the best damage move you have for the first 20 levels.
---
Anger Management alone makes Arms more desirable than fury for levelling, I just dont see the fury talents being as useful.
---
I mean, modern WoW may not be completely dead, but you could definitely say it is in the process of failing.
---
The rest of your post is just you making a guess. We really don't know how many people out there really want Vanilla or an updated version of Vanilla. We also don't know what that new content added to Vanilla would be yet do we can't even hypothesize who would want it.
---
I always thought Magni was the Alliance leader, since Ironforge was the capital.
---
Yes but the threat was increased substantially in patch 1.7, BWL and shieldslam was added in 1.6. So yes they had it, but it didn't generate near as much threat as it did after the buff. 1.7 was 3 months after BWL was added.
---
Did both, if the /sit macro doesnt work id go arms for sure.
---
Tactical mastery into anger management.
---
Just be sure to pick a good race. You can always try a fun spec and reset your talents, but you can't change your race.
---
My gf loves watching me playing wow, for honor, dbd or whatever. I also love watching her playing ow (shes a godlike widow). Hope you guys would someday meey somebody wonderful like my girl

The 3 man was done in T3 with TBC talents, yes.
---
The 4 man was done with BWL/aq40 gear.
---
The 5 man was done in BWL, MC gear IIRC.
---
This is smart. Right before Valentine's. Save money
---
If you're doing a job where you work from home but can get away by playing WoW is it worth doing or actually that challenging?
---
So do you think picking up Alchemy + Engineering instead of Engineering + Mining will save me money? I will eventually level a mage for gold farming, so I dunno what exactly to do with professions. 
---
Interesting. I searched and wasn't able to find any sources claiming binary spells work this way, appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction.
---
Which ever the case may be on difference private servers, the fact remains that 1 rage per 3 second is how it actually worked in vanilla, atleast that much is established.
---
Well said and spot on. Most of the time it's not the fact that you're gaming, it's all the other stuff you ignore while doing so (Cleaning, making dinner, eating together, etc).
---
The meme specs you mean? That's fine 
---
Taurens "replaced" the Night Elf sign post with their own.
---
depends on if you mean 99% in common like similar interest, or 99% compatible personalities, because it takes a lot more to have a good relationship than just having interests in common, at least in the long run.
---
and I don't see how I could be compatible with someone who doesn't let me have some me-time every now and then, even if it's something she has no interest in, in the slightest
---
So it might end up being better than the system we have today once I get used to it?
---
A crowd of people at a fancy gallery staring at a black blob on a white canvas, each trying to be more amazed than the other at how marvelous the painting is.
---
Personally I like the idea of having to raid to get good PvP gear. Something that's also unique with Classic.
---
I wouldn't say 100 days is anywhere near active haha, that's some number padding if I've ever seen it.

&gt; I mean, modern WoW may not be completely dead, but you could definitely say it is in the process of failing.
---
It's not failing any time soon. It's in decline, and has been for years, but it is still easily staying afloat. 
---
&gt;The rest of your post is just you making a guess. We really don't know how many people out there really want Vanilla or an updated version of Vanilla. 
---
Yes, of course. That's just what I've seen when talking to people and on the internet in general. Outside of bubbles like this sub there are plenty of people who are excited about classic, but few people who think that's exactly how WoW should be. Ask people what their favourite WoW expansion was and most are going to say Wrath or TBC, that shows up in surveys all the time. 
---
&gt;We also don't know what that new content added to Vanilla would be yet do we can't even hypothesize who would want it.
---
Doesn't matter. It won't happen unless we have a ton of people asking for it, like people did with Classic. So how many people wants it without knowing exactly what it will be is actually what is relevant to this discussion. 
---
&gt;from a gameplay and RPG standpoint it's just a more immersive game. Retail is watered down so much to the point of almost having no "soul", just because classic doesn't have as many QOL features or complex raid fights, doesn't mean that classic is just "pure nostalgia'.
---
The problem with WoW past Vanilla is that hardly any systems were improved upon, they kept getting changed for the worse. WoW stopped being an RPG a very long time ago and it somewhat recently stopped being an MMO as well.. What I hate the most is the post Vanilla quest design which simply doesn't belong in ANY game.
---
Awesome, I'm actually pleasantly surprised that so many of you would be ok with Blizz postponing.  And I agree with you too,  I'd rather they take their time and give us a good and stable product then to rush it.
---
So what was the second half of 8.0 fire mages then? ABsolute top tier in arena and m+ and only real viable mythic spec
---
You want to continue on with a private server where you have no rights and your character can evaporate? Lack of gm support doesn't bother you? All to avoid paying $15? 
---
MP5 is roughly equally valuable for all healers. Priests and druids also get regen from spirit, but that doesn't make MP5 any less valuable for them.
---
i dont agree. gear changes are reasonable but having talents change for every single patch is insane. choose one talent tree and stick with it. thats just autistic 
---
15 bucks isn't a lot of money anymore. If you think it is then reevaluate.
---
I personally would not recommend going alchemy and engineering (atleast not until the pvp/bwl patch launches). Once the pvp system is released (which might be anything from 4-6 months after launch), then you could go alchemy and engineering, since you should have amassed ALOT of gold (+epic mount). 
---
For example, if you have alchemy and herbalism, you can casually do your rounds collecting herbs while watching tv. This way youll sell herbs for gold and get herbs for your own use. If you dont have herbalism, every single potion you wanna make, youll have to buy stacks of herbs. Even low level herbs for swiftness potions. It happens very frequently that its cheaper to buy the finished potions off the auction house, than actually buying the mats. 
---
As for engineering. Its very hard to make gold with engineering, especially without specific recipes you get from Molten Core. Off the top of my head, you can make gold by selling sapper charges (since only goblin engineers can make them and most people go gnome), but its a small market for the try hard pvpers. 
---
The advantage of mining and engineering is that you can farm arcane crystals and other gems from rich thorium veins. These sell for alot. An arcane crystal is an instant 25-35 gold. Due to timezone restrictions (eu servers/us servers) and server population size, it should be realistic to be able to farm uninterrupted at odd hours (like 5 am). If you get lucky with arcane crystals, you can amass alot of gold. 
---
gz
---
wow &gt; girls
---
Not everyone is poor my man.
---
Not to mention I dropped those shitholes the moment classic got announced.
---
nostalrius did progressive items and it worked great. much more reasonable then having 100000 class changed every patch trying to match how it was back then. just give items their old values depending on the patch and when certain patterns dropped. like titanic leggings
---
This. And 15 bucks a month is a great incentive for assholes to stay out. Where so I have to sign?
---
Well, you are stupid but are here as well, so
---
You can for 25 bucks
---
Private server =/= Vanilla. Classic isn't 1:1 Vanilla either but at least they can get the values right.
---
Ofcourse I would switch to classic over ps. Playing on ps is just menaningless, because as everyone said, all your work can disappear any time
---
This works.... if you don't want to raid
---
Both. 
---
Hunters are still needed in raids. So it's not about min/max in this case.
---
Of course you won't top DPS charts but you are still required. Just be sure to be a good hunter and not a keyboard-turner/backpedaller/clicker one and you'll get your spot.
---
I'm playing hunter as well :)
---
They were, your memory is wrong.
---
Stealth no longer breaks with any amount of damage, that's probably where you got the idea.
---
Not during vanilla? Good thing I skipped cata and all the expansions after panda
---
&gt; But there are many others that have been playing on private servers over the past 4 years. 
---
What would be the advantage for these players to switch over to Classic just to start over again? I've never played on a pserver.
---
World changed. Horde are going to take all Kalimdor "soon", thats just a matter of time.
---
Elfs civilization  retreats, leaving zone by zone, and only old night elf sign post remembers that once upon a time that was Night Elf's land... Such an artifact.
---
Thanks A LOT for this reply. I want to ask one more question: Would you recommend going engineering from the start (I don't mean from level 1, but as the first profession I will get) or waiting for the PvP patch? I will definitelly go for it by the PvP patch, but I wonder if it is perhaps valuable to go herb and mining instead of having the (perhaps useless) engineering. Basically what would you recommend for me to do if I will want Engineering by the time PvP patch will launch?
---
Assuming Blizzard doesn’t mess it up I will switch. If I feel the changes they make willl not be good I’ll probably just stay on my private server 
---
lol I am wondering if many are like me. Super excited to play classic, but skeptical I'll even have time. Damn kids. damn wife. damn job. damn cat. damn dog. damn yard. damn house. damn rl. lol And I love them all dearly. Except the yard. I have a feeling it's going  to take me over 6 months to 60. 
---
yup
---
ikr. Generally I have nothing but praise for Blizz's art department, but their icon design has gone to shit.
---
Can I get your girl's number?
---
Private Servers are a violation of Blizzards Intellectual Property. When classic is released, blizzard will more likely pursue more aggressive C&amp;D orders on all private servers because they will have a stronger argument for IP Violations and it having an actual impact on their business.
---
I'll be happy to leave private servers, and just as happy to leave r/wowserver. Too much toxicity there.
---
I don't know if I would've ever stopped playing WoW, but the level and gear grind ruined the game for me.
---
I really enjoyed raiding and clearing zones, while hanging out with my friends.  Instead the game was about grinding levels, grinding rep, grinding materials, grinding "X".  I would've been perfectly fine with a game that stopped at AQ and Naxx for many years.
---
Their business model has ruined their game, so I hope the "oldness" of Classic is fun simply by it being a good game.
---
I hate that with every expansion they increased level cap by 10.  That introduces a lot of issues and makes a lot of items irrelevant.  Classicast was talking about an MMO that didn’t increase level cap for like 10 years.  That’s what I want with WoW... but we can worry about that later down the road, just waiting for Classic now
---
Any server that allowed characters to be imported wouldn't be very popular with the huge crowd of FRESH players, you would still have your character but on ghost town server.
---
15 bucks a month is nothing in relation to the sheer number of hours you get out of it.
---
I don't mean to offend anyone, but if you can't afford 15 bucks a months then you should get your life together.
---
Players started leaving in large amounts in TBC and WotLK. However newer players replaced them at a faster rate than people were leaving. So in WotLK, the game was gaining subs, but hemorrhaging a lot too because players who has been playing since Vanilla hated the direction the game was going in. They also introduced LFD in WotLK which is literal cancer for the game and killed it slowly overtime.
---
I picked up retail about a month ago  and I was appalled to see that 5-man dungeons are in horrible place. What was one of the best things about Vanilla, is now boring, anti-social and pretty much pointless. Some things, like PvP, are in a good state IMO. But they have absolutely fucked up core elements of the game to the point it is no longer a good MMO. It's more of an ARPG looter than anything else now.
---
I'm assuming he means it wasn't providing the 1 rage per 3 second tick on some private servers, which would make sense. Not having the actual data files, some private servers would have been built using the descriptions of what the talent did rather than documented information of what it did.
---
Still can be a bit for some people. But personally, it's interesting how things have changed. It used to be something I had to specifically budget for, or work more to afford. Now it's less than my monthly guacamole budget.
---
You'll just end up dying alot if you don't use hamstring to kite.
---
Arms is superior to Fury for leveling.
---
I remember actually using these as a source of direction. Good times.
---
A time when you can look at gear icons and know what the character is wearing.
---
Imp. HS is useless for warrior leveling. You barely use the spell after early levels. Deflection is much better.
---
Yeah its this 100%. My friend group is spread across a couple of states so gaming is a way we can stay in touch. Due to adult life with kids and spouses its become way easier to just schedule our gaming. I've ended up with Tuesday/Thursday/one weekend that changes based on schedule. 
---
This has worked out pretty great for us, I don't game until dinner is done and dishes are put away. If I'm not cooking I'm straightening up or taking the dog out. Then I go game. The days I don't I hang out with my wife or do chores. Then with the weekend flexibility, its about choosing to do something IRL with the wife or friends then fitting in gaming when I can. 
---
Its been a great balance that allows me to enjoy a hobby I love and hang out with friends while still spending plenty of time with my wife and getting the necessary housework done. 
---
What spec?
---
Fury build is only good for 5% crit and enrage. Besides that, you're just wasting points. Arms is much better, due to every point spent being useful.
---
I'm not a WoW expert for classic or retail, but the reason i'm excited is because i'm an oldschool EQ player who has way less time on my hands than ever before. Alot of people here talk about classic as difficult, slow, or whatever else, but for me that is not the case. The two main reasons i want classic is because it is a casual version of the difficult rpg's and mmo's that i'm interested in but no longer have time for. I find it's a good blend of recreating that sense of work that made characters matter, but without forcing you to be a no lifer (except PVP ranking). The second reason is that classic has the right amount of content for someone who hasn't followed wow from start to current. It lacks the bloat and weird features that i don't recognize or relate too as a gamer. It's beautiful in its casual simplicity, it doesn't need minigames within the game, or dailies, or anything else. I plan to get my fiancee' into it, having gotten her into oldschool and current EQ, as well as other games. So there will definitely be new people, including myself. I played when it came out but never made it to max level, so i'm excited to experience dungeons i recognize (DM, WC, etc.) and new ones. I wouldn't worry about being new, i'd look into if it fits the style of game your interested in.
---
It's not whether or not you enjoy it. It's more that the question is "why is playing wow worth the opportunity cost. Why not play some otger game"?
---
Correct.
---
With that in mind it sounds pretty good!  
---
A lot of people I'd imagine. If you been around the private server scene long enough you will have had your server shut down. You would've seen corrupted private server owners selling gear/characters on the down low. Witness the population go from thousands and then dwindle down to &gt;1000. 
---
I'll be paying blizzard for wow for the fist time in years
---
Nah bro she just wondering why you're playing an enh Shaman in Vanilla wow cos they trash.
---
Trying to remember if everyone who actually played Vanilla was as illiterate as these forums make me feel Classic will be.
---
Jumping ship at the first opportunity and gifting some random lucky person all my hard earned gold.
---
I was in one of those guilds with those 20 sec Vael runs. No it isn't possible on live because certain world buffs are stack-able together on private servers that was never possible on Live.
---
If Activision messes it up with loot sharing, sharding and progressive itemization, spell batching, and the patch cycles - yes I will just go back to a specific private server.
---
If you're already playing a private server, and you have friends and time invested on it, why not stay?
---
I would honestly recommend alch/herb from the start. This is a great way to make gold (frostadamus makes great youtube videos explaining how in detail) and for the "pvp" potions. Since youll only be doing world pvp (before the pvp patch), engineering would be overkill.
---
Having both mining and herbalism is a bit of an issue, because your minimap can only "search" for one or the other. So youll be riding through the zone collecting one or the other (or you have to constantly activate the other "search" skill).
---
The thing about alchemy is that its cheap to skill to 300 and its only a shame to drop if you actually get flask recipes. These are only obtained from dungeons. Since everyone knows that theyre worth alot, sadly if they drop 5 people will roll on them (even non alchemists). These recipes are sold in the auction house for 500-100 gold in the fist stage of the game (pre pvp patch). 
---
So if you dont get one of these recipes, dropping alchemy once pvp patch launches is not a waste at all. The moment pvp system launches, definitely go for engineering. 
---
I would recommend watching Frostadamus' youtube series on trade skills.

Resto.
---
Good to know.
---
Right now I'm thinking to play as one of those: Rogue, Warrior (but I believe there will be too many), Shaman or Paladin (but from what I read it seems they damage is too bad on Classic and I really don't wanna heal.
---
I used to play on Private servers often, but after losing my character so many times to due server shut downs, or low populations due to the next big server, I'd rather just wait till Classic and cherish my character then. 
---
This was a primary factor in their decision to start classic server. I believe US law states that if you do not financially legally pursue copyright infringements, after a period of time you loose the copyright. That would be a huge hit to actibliz
---
15 a month is breaking the bank for you? Might need to invest some of your time away from games if that's the case. 
---
I already quit pservers back when they made the announcement. I want to go into the classic launch feeling as fresh as possible, and while I miss the game I'm happy to say good-bye to the general toxicity of pservers.
---
Data transfer is never going to happen, that would be idiotic. 
---
I've spent more time /played playing classic on vanilla servers than playing from WotlK till Legion on retail.
---
It's THE game for me
---
Depend how much can you FAP under one LAP
---
"So this one person thought of this one thing, and I thought it was funny.  So, I thought to myself, "Hey, I'm funny too!  I can do this!", but it turned out I'm an unclever nitwit."
---
I mean both. And quite frankly, the idea that people keep floating that someone is forbidding gaming is weird and a problem that stems beyond commonalities, etc. The post i replied too talked about having things in common, not someone being a controlling monster. Obviously if your SO acts like a prison guard with your time/life, thats a problem. But alot of comments are straying into weird abusive relationships rather than balancing gaming as a hobby while dating someone who isn't into it. 
---
&gt; 15 bucks a month is a great incentive for assholes to stay out
---
This. Private servers have some truly horrific players who thrive on the lack of oversight and I hope they stay there. 
---
I kinda feel the opposite way. Orcs post-WoD look far softer and more human than before, which further distinguishes them from their rather brutal Warhammer counterparts. 
---
He's not offensively bad like Thrall ended up, but he's pretty boring and bland. 
---
You are too late for Vanilla, but Classic could be fun.  It's probably better that you missed Vanilla so that you won't see how poorly Classic will hit that mark.  
---
"Time is money, friend"
---
When Blizz shuts down your sever or it goes p2w or goes empty for fresh, how much time do you think you'll lose? How much is that character with 1000 hours who is now gone worth to you in $$?
---
Yes and no. If for instance they heavily shard durotar, lightly shard the barrens, and do no shards after that the number of zones is increased while the number of people in those level brackets shrinks. After a couple weeks they can turn off sharing entirely and the player base is spread out over at least 6-7 zones rather than 3-4.
---
Unless they severely fuck up with Classic the no, private servers are dead to me.
---
It isn't essential for any fast raids. Mana pots are and taking short drinks often are.
---
A lot of people live in countries with poor employment, low minimum wage, and a lack of social support. Don't rag on Americans.  
---
&gt; Wrath leveling was, in my opinion, the best experience of any expansion (not including the base game), because it was the most diverse. 
---
WotLK leveling doesn't belong in an RPG. It was streamlined garbage.
---
Just lead raids and you'll get a new girlfriend who will give you handies for hand outs.
---
I will leave p-servers and only pay and play classic unless its ruined by sharding and loot trading and other crap.
---
Are you telling me someone would do that....?  Someone would *lie* on the internet?
---
[meirl](https://i.imgur.com/yXCgW7X.png)
---
I have 0 reason to ever play private servers after it gets released, i barely even play classic wow right now because it feels bad knowing u might lose it all + i know i will 100% play on blizzards servers. I guess you are the oppesite though, you don't wanna lose all your private server progress, but the thing is you might just lose it randomly for no reason. Maybe they stop supporting the servers, maybe they start a new server (New server = old one gets left behind into a no pop server) etc. 
---
So i don't see any reason to stay on private servers unless u simply can't afford to pay blizzard.
---
Hi, I'm a random person.
---
Been saying this since the first moment they mentioned classic, lots of private realms are going to close voluntarily the rest will struggle to find a host anywhere on the planet
---
Might v want to take in threat changes and 1.12 talents. Lol. 
---
"What's the point of Instagram?  Or Pinterest?  Or any of the other inane things you do to convince yourself that you are remarkable when in reality you fall starkly short?"
---
Perhaps only think the last bit.
---
It will take a bit of grinding but you could get the Tidal Charm and have that 3 second stun on your shaman without having to be a Tauren.
---
Don’t eat Wendy’s for two meals a month and there is your $15.  Christ.  
---
I understand that saved money is saved money, but the amount of hours of entertainment you get from a $15 sub (which includes BOTH games) is pretty ridiculous.  
---
The only person who can evaluate if that $15 is worth the actual amount of time they play is themselves, though.  If you’re playing a private server that number is likely high, therefore, why not pay $15 for the real thing that is backed by a company with structure.. and the rights to the IP. 
---
Grab the Tidal Charm trinket, it will take a little bit of grinding but then you have Hardiness and a 3 second stun on your shaman.
---
Unless you want 1.1-1.12 you don't want Vanilla. I think a lot of ppl confuse them wanting a private server feel (Nost rly) with them wanting Vanilla..
---
Just go 2h Arms. Maybe 2h Fury til 40 for the shouts/damage, it's debatable if it'd be worth it if you're not constantly slamming though 
---
Little real data, wildly varying private projects, the arguably miserable Warrior leveling experience, and their talent/option diversity is why there's so much deliberation. There're similar &amp; equally endless debates over Priest leveling for a lot of the same reasons
---
I didn't suggest that controlling or abusive relationships are okay if you have similar interests. I just took it as why some people would game less or even stop if it wasn't huge to them. Alot of comments in this thread make it seem like balancing a video game with the needs of a SO is something worth leaving them for.

Does the right-side picture not look more brutal and bulky?
---
If I remember Shamans are OP
---
There isn't a right answer for this. 
---
With a rogue you can kill a lot faster and is a better pvp solo class.
---
Obviously paladins offer more utility as they can play 3 different roles in an instance. 
---
Chicks come and go. Epics lasts forever.

---
This is not even remotely true. Copyright exists for the life of the author plus 50-75 years depending on which country you live in as a general concern. You can prevent anyone from exploiting your copyright at any time.
---
Trademarks on the other hand are different. If someone uses your trademark and you don’t defend it, there are a number of different factors at play. But no one is out there making a game called “world of Warcraft” so it’s not as much of an issue,
---
The reason you wouldn't need to do this is because you start using axes exclusively for a while starting at level 30, and you have a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5% axe crit talent in the Arms tree around the same time, along with even better talents.
---
I'm in the same boat as you.
---
It feels like I'm raising and disciplining a child at times. These females need too much fucking attention.

No one knows how accurate private servers are.  A lot of things is pure guess work.  Classic will also have its own numbers since they'll need to run the 1.12 numbers and "massage" them through the Retail engine.  It's like fitting a square peg in a round hole.  
---
That being said, some sort of re-tuning needs to be done so that it's not EZ mode like it is on private servers.  i.e. MC as of 1.1 BWL as of 1.6.  Want to know what the authentic Vanilla experience raiding was like?  That was it - or at least around then.    News flash, Ony was partly a requirement for Rag due to the +15 FR.  And yes, if your DPS didn't have FR, you're healers would OOM.   
---
Fights were a lot longer.  I'd love original Scholo/Strath, but that'd be too much. 2+ hours just to finish an instance?  One wipe = gg due to respawns and way too much trash?  The grind would be too much.
---
Talents were way worse.  Itemization was terrible.  Did you know how long it took to kill things?  And whatever happened in 1.11 regarding Tank threat, needs to be reverted.
---
MC still took hours to complete, even in T2.  Raiding was very much, pick 2 raids a week and do them.  It wasn't raid MC every week, just for Thunderfury.  
---
Private servers are "fresh", but also for a whole different reason.  People enter Naxx fresh and not burnt out.  Where as in Vanilla, a guild was lucky to even get to Naxx to begin with due to poaching, splits, etc.
---
How'd the break up go? We want and update.
---
i wouldn't mind , if they would release that within Vanilla after 3 to 5 years after classic wow release
---
Shadow Priests, Moonkin, Retri Paladins and Prot Paladins (and I think ele shaman but im alliance scum so not sure) were actually crippled by their lack of mana regeneration. It was running completely OOM that was the primary reason they just completely sucked for DPS. Paladins had to downrank their spells as their max dps rotation would OOM them in about a minute. That is, using Judgement on cooldown, debuffing with SoC not JoW, and keeping max rank Consec up 100%. 
---
Protadins were the tank version of this problem. They couldnt maintain high threat on a main target because they'd run out of mana using all their max rank damage spells. They were great in 5mans but abysmal on bosses as they just couldnt keep up in single target threat without the TBC buff of having BoSanc give you mana back when healed.
---
In a sense "Mana" is pretty much the main reason all unviable specs in vanilla were unviable.
---
Karazhan is my all time fav raid. I would not be sad if we got it eventually!
---
Yes,  I want full classic as close to how it was originally as possible.
---
Just not that keen on TBC (since it added a lot of issues, Outland especally) and especally not Wrath.
---
wasnt mortal strike 200% in an older patch?
---
Orc is much better, not even up for debate. Do you want to have a 2 second stun on a 2 minute cooldown, or do you want 25% increased stun resistance so you can resist 5point kindet shot, cheap shot, grenades, tidal charm, charge, intercept, hunter pet stun, hammer of justice, bash, blackout procs, impact, unstoppable force proc.. the list goes on.
---
Stop being the r-word realise that Tauren literally sucks compared to Orc.
---
Karazhan feels like a suitable 40 man Raid for sure.
---
When I read the title I was expecting a post on how to not burst into rage while being corpse ganked in STV, lol.
---
/r/MGTOW one of us.
---
Ok :)
---
My opinion is Blizzard is way to stubborn to ever admit defeat, so if retail really dies, Classic will be shutdown too, like they implied at Blizzcon.
---
Only way to avoid that would be if Classic tops the record of retail concurrent players (that's 12 millions during WotLK) but I don't believe it'll happen.
---
Moreover, although people who played during vanilla's time as retail now have kids and less time to spend, that doesn't mean that there arn't younger people who have time to dedicate to a more traditional style of mmorpg. I can think of a few teenagers who play fortnite from 3:30pm-10pm during the weekdays as i'm sure most of you can. The younger hardcore players are around and waiting for a game like wow that rewards time spent. 
---
Proof F2P games suck ass in both community and economy.
---
During vanilla I Never got to play much because of my mom. During nostalrius i had my ex around all the time. This time I've dedicated all my time for classic, can't wait and i totally understand you brother!! Best of luck
---
I mean sure, if gaming isn’t a big part of your life and it’s your decision then whatever makes you happy is cool.  I’d wager that on a video game sub, particularly a more hardcore niche game like this, gaming is likely the main hobby for folks and a big part of their life which influences their responses.  For people like this asking them to give up one of their favorite things would certainly be controlling or abusive.
---
You also got to choose between Dragonblight and Grizzly Hills.  There was a lot more choice than you had in TBC, or in any expansion since then.
---
Right, I stand corrected. 
---
It was intended to be, thats why Atiesh was in Nax (which makes no sense) and also probably why Kara is so fucking huge.
---
It would also have made more sense for it to open before TBC, and being related to the opening off the dark portal.
---
The assets for Karazhan are already in vanilla, and the crypts as well which could be used for the classic project.
---
Roomers and loosing...

Or we could get another repeat of that year where Blizzcon got cancelled.
---
....until the greens from next expansion render them obsolete.
---
I think Tauren is better against casters,and even if you get stunlocked, you are surely gonna be using insignia.
---
despair ahead
---
therefore
---
be wary of fire
---
Well, I have limited experience with both (compared to other classes that I have done 0-60 several times), but priest is generally a really strong leveling class. Shamans I don't know too much about effeciency while leveling, but I find them really fun to level with their weapon enchants and spells, feels like a kind of elemental battle mage.
---
Overall, priest probably wins out on solo questing, but both are fine.
---
There’s always a tiny trickle of comments in the retail subreddit that slam Classic. They’re almost never OPs, when they are they aren’t upvotes much. 
---
But if you go and look for it you’ll see a few voices saying things like “it’s so boring”, “people will just quit once the realize how hard it is”, etc.
---
But yes. I agree, you have to go actively look to find them. Definitely not like here where a OP slamming retail will stay on the front page for a week or more. 
---
Dwindle to a greater number huh?
---
5% crit is more powerful and useful then any two tiers of talents in arms combined. 
---
Not losing everything is the exact reason people want classic over private servers.
---
It’s $15 a month not exactly breaking the bank.
---
Kind of funny, i feel dungeons are in a good spot atm. I have boatloads of fun with ppl i've played WoW with for years (some since Vanilla) since Challenge modes and later in Legion M+ came out and made dungeons relevant again throughout the whole expansion. 
---
Just don't use LFG and play with friends instead of stangers. 
---
At that point it fails to accurately represent how Vanilla WoW was back then, which again: would happen if they stick to 1.12 exactly. And as much as I would like Original AV, I would be willing to let go of it if it means having the game as close to the original deal as possible, for good or for bad.
---
We are not talking about specific scenarios, we are talking about what race is better in World of Warcraft for PvP.
---
The answer is Orc &gt; Tauren
---
Key to new content is not stronger items - that leads to problems current wow has.  Key is to create interesting items that can add interesting gameplay mechanics (e.g. a shield that grants the spell reflect ability, items that give some cross-class abilities).
---
That's what made Diablo 2 so amazing.  Once they created items that added some cross-class abilities, entire new builds become possible.
---
That's what itemization in WoW should do at end-game, in a Karazhan raid.
---
Probably Warlock. If it wasn't for the debuff slot limits and their high threat gain, they'd give Warriors a run for their money.
---
I actually mained druid in vanilla myself.
---
As for what is more interesting, it is hard to say. Warlock and mage are both really interesting. Of course both are more or less just one spell in raids, but it's their utility in other content and PvP that makes them fun.
---
Honestly I think they are quite a like in terms of "amount of flavor". The two core things to consider are playstyle and theme. With playstyle I mean Warlocks using DoTs (again, not much in raids, but other content). They also have a pet to manage. They have utility like summoning party members or a Doomguard, Healthstones and their whole Soulstone mechanic. 
---
Mages on the other hand got portals and conjuring things as flavor. They focus on direct damage spells instead of DoTs. 
---
As for the theme, mage are kind of scholar type wizards. Very polished and controlled magic, which personally I find a tiny bit too bland. Warlocks have chaotic spells with dark energies and their fire is more destructive than mages controlled flames.
---
I'd advice you to look at PvP videos of both. Raid videos won't show much since it's just one spell, so even if you don't plan to PvP those videos show much more of the class. Also, you might consider an instant lvl 60 server and spend a few days on each class.
---
Read John Staats book. It kinda was, but kinda wasn’t. 
---
Vanilla development was kind of a Wild West. Yes, they worked on Kara during Vanilla, but they decided to put it in TBC by very early 2005.
---
So, no. Not really. Atiesh was made, and added to Naxx well after Jara was scheduled for TBC. 
---
Might help to research your data via legitimate sources before making declarative statements. 
---
Mage iirc since if it’s theoretical that includes AoE right?
---
If not, Human Fury warrior with post-Naxx BiS for the sword skill boost.
---
I don't think itemization makes that much of a difference on Vael. We never just wiped due to not having enough damage, but rather when our rogues would over dps and pull aggro. Maybe it is different on alliance, but this is the fight where not having pallies makes the biggest difference.
---
Assets for the finished Karazhan are not in Vanilla. The version that exists in the Vanilla game files is drastically different. Go check Hayven Games on YT. He has videos of it. 
---
Terrible advice, I bet the ladies love you.
---
I can relate to this. Learned it the hard way with my ex... Now I m myself with my SO ! I even introduced her to wow and played on a pserver till lvl 45. Don t blame her she prefer retail now... 
---
Yikes
---
Hunter is pretty much exactly the opposite of what u wrote.
---
"Tyrande has no idea how to lead our people"
---
"I have vision that she lacks"
---
Even though the Morrowgrain quests were so "evil" in nature... I still have a sentiment to them. That long hours grinding that Un'goro gorillas to get to level 60... because un'goto was less overrun by horde than burning steppes and searing gorge.
---
Then, watching some Lord of the Rings premiere on the TV, and every commercial break, running up the stairs, and clicking the \[Packet of Tharlendris Seeds\], to make that \[Evergreen pouch\], which can contain \[Morrowgrain\].
---
Some commercial breaks were so long, that I could click the item twice. As it happens with TV premieres...
---
Then, the movie was over, I clicked that item once again, went to the shower, returned, clicked. Went to sleep, woke up, clicked, got dressed, ate breakfast, clicked.
---
And then, opened all that \[Evergreen pouch\]s. Enjoyed my Morrowgrain, which I turned in for that potions. I made quite a fortune selling those potions on AH, and someone even asked me on /w about alchemy, because he saw the AH being overrun with my potions.
---
And, the power crystals in un'goro, only added to the sentiment of that quest.
---
At a later time, I was leveling another character, and this quest was so much personal meme for me, that I remember fighting around the EoTS flag, just killed them, but instead of taking the flag, I had to make that \[Evergreen pouch\], because my PVP cooldown addon just shouted "\[Packet of Tharlendris Seeds\] ready now!"
---
Later, I've wanted to do it again, and since it was removed on patch 3.3.something, I had to go for private servers.
---
And the disappointment, when I leveled all the way to 50, only to find out that... the quest is disabled there.
---
Let's hope Blizzard #nochanges this quest. It really doesn'T disturb the balance of alchemy much, even though it gives level 50 potions, they still aren't the best ones.
---
If Blizzard wants to create a separate branch and add vanilla patches/expansions, they have the ability to create an evergreen 1.12 server that will never receive those updates.  If you're a purist who wants nothing to do with post-Naxx content, stay on one of those servers, or use a free transfer to get on to one of them.
---
&gt; And all I am saying is that the repetitiveness of end game in classic isnt necessarily a good thing
---
But why would you bring this up? You are repeating history. WoD failed because it lacked content, so Legion and BfA got plenty. Modern WoW is all about enough content. This is classic, so we need vanilla game design philosophies. Yours is a modern WoW philosophy. No, the vanilla "repetitiveness" isn't necessarily a good thing, but it's *Classic WoW*, not a reimagination of what Vanilla mixed with modern design philosophies would look like. That's why it doesn't make sense to even talk about it.
---
&gt; new content will eventually be needed.
---
No. Blizzard said it themselves, they are not trying to run 2 MMORPG's. This isn't a fresh start to build on, it's not meant to build onto. It's a historic game relaunched. It will take several years before anything is needed and by then they can either restart so people can start over (yes, people like that. Look how people flock to fresh pserver launches), or they can go and launch TBC. The later is only a possibility if Classic becomes a *big* success, since it takes a lot of work to make TBC like they are currently making Vanilla.
---
Again, this is not a reimagination of Vanilla and it's not a building block to make a whole new MMORPG next to their other WoW game. Modern WoW is for new stuff, Classic is just a historic game relaunched.
---
Oh yeah. How crap anger management, sweeping strikes, imp overpower, and tactical mastery must be... I'm starting to get the idea you don't actually know what you're talking about. 
---
Okay,I can see that you don't want to discuss this,but let me tell ya,what is better ability that you can use and will work every time or another RNG based passive that you can replace by insignia (which is better)?
---
For a group that has sworn off women, MGTOW seem rather obsessed with them. Quite a funny situation, if you ask me.
---
Yes we have all already agreed that it would be beyond interesting to see this in classic WoW, but it won't happen.
---
I would say it's technically not a raid because you can reset it just like a dungeon rather than being on a weekly timer
---
Enhancement shaman isn't hard for hunters at all. Frost mages are a difficult match for hunters, and warlocks are the biggest hard counter.
---
You must not have pvpd much. 
---
Are you really that bad with women that you think it is somehow a difficult task to befuddle their minds and woo them?  If you're too timid to stand toe to toe with a woman when she asks you the point of a hobby to then counter with the point of her own hobby, then I know all I need to.  You are bad with women.
---
How would the difficulty work out for the new content tho? On release would it just be completed day 1 by the best guilds? 
---
Genuine question I’m not that experienced 
---
You know you can have the racial passive AND insignia right? You act insignia replaces the racial, how stupid are you lol?
---
What are you gonna do when war stomp is on cooldown? yeah its useless for 2 minutes. Passive is always there. I dont know dude, if you wanna argue that the earth is flat aswell Im here for you. Bring me more
---
&gt;5 seconds
---
hah, noob
---
How anyone else prefers to spend their own time is irrelevant to me unless I’m in a relationship. Don’t get into a relationship with someone who questions your hobbies. You don’t need to go “toe to toe” with someone you’re in a relationship with.
---
Found the paladin
---
Obviously it didn't get approved, or reach finished development, or was added into vanilla. But at some point, similar to HFP or Emerald Dream or whatever, it was ideas that were thrown around and cut for whatever reason.
---
I'd like to see Blizzard focus on those assets as oppose to going the wrong way with BC and eventually reaching the downfall in Wrath.
---
And yeah, you are probalby right. Just really odd to add  Atiesh to Naxxramas if Karazhan wasn't intended as a 60 raid, from outside it looks like it was a sort of "last minute change" before TBC was out, as it would make much more sense for it to be in Kara.
---
The hunter one could almost be true if reversed. Enhancement shaman are one of the easiest fights in the game for a hunter, and mages are the hardest after locks imo.
---
Stop. Just seriously if you can't handle the point of vanilla then don't play, stop trying to make it fit to "what you want" that is selfish and honestly you're exactly the kind of person who made retail into the mess it is today.
---
Like, even DW arms if you get a couple of nice one-handers can feel great because your opponents will be dodging constantly, and hell man, that Imp Overpower talent is /satisfying/
---
I leveled as arms without a guide and had a lot of fun.
---
I think Kara would be great to introduce an offspec tier of gear for all the classes. Not a T3.5 but an alternative to T3. 
---
T3 gear was great, but it was only tailored for each class's primary spec/role. Sure there's ZG/AQ20/40 gear and non-set items that helped with that, but it would be nice to have something that's T3 item level, matching, and good for classes primary alternate spec. 
---
You are totally free to do whatever you want dude. Want to play a suboptimal spec? Hell yeah! There will be guilds for you. But I am just mind boggled how can people that want to be better at the game and optimize what they do ruin the game experience for you. How is trying to be good a wrong thing? I understand it scraps the "magic" off the game, but some people dont find enjoyment in that. Me personally I'd be bored to hell if I played something that I knew will never have any use in a serious raid environment. Whereas you just want to enjoy yourself. We can coexist dude. No reason to feel like shit because people want to do things efficienty.
---
it still represents vanilla wow... your never going to get every talent change and ability change. never in a million years will that happen. theres like thousands of talent changes and spell changes combined now imagine having to make it so each patch is how those talents/spells acted and making sure they all act as how they did with no bugs and then changing it a few weeks later for its new variants. its complicated enough to make sure all the 1.12 talents work correctly and as it and now imagine that times 10 thousand. if they want they can readjust content but they wont be having 10 thousand talent/spell changes. on the other hand the items are much simpler to have its old itemization at certain patches
---
If only PvP server
---
You mean like basically every expansion aside from these last 4? Yeah me too. 
---
Motivations will vary but for me:
---
- Getting the official Blizzard experience
---
- Thrill of a fresh server
---
- I can't easily prove it, but took away from the demo that Classic is going to have crisper graphics and the client feels more responsive
---
Just lol 
---
The thing Nostalrius did the best was to prove that classic servers on can work fine with huge populations, never having problems getting into dungeons, always having people in every zone. Having raiding-guild rivalries on the same server, and even cross-faction rivalries and PvP guilds just trying to fuck each other over.
---
I hope We will have equally high pop servers on the Blizzard servers to experience that glorious shitshow once again, truly an epic MMORPG experience.
---
It’s not hard. It’s just an incredibly long grind that requires full attention (can’t afk any of it)
---
Classic wasn’t hard. It was just a new concept. The game has gotten much harder mechanics wise, and it’ll get run over this time around if people stick. The only challenge was numbers
---
its a bis ring for all 5 mans and quite a lot raid encounters for a healer
---
At least she likes WoW vs. "Oh my God stop playing X and watch a terrible romance movie with me!"
---
Well that's the thing,as Orc, you will also use insignia no matter what. Generally,you won't get stunned every second unless you are an idiot who doesn't know how to use granades and engineering trinkets. So using insignia and getting out from CC is same for both races. What really matters then is the war stomp. 
---
I am not still decided yet, but I want to discuss what racial is better in which situation(and I think hardiness is totally useless vs warlocks and mages which are probably the biggest counters for ele sham). And also,I might end up rolling Orc because I don't really like how Tauren looks.
---
&gt; It was intended to be, thats why Atiesh was in Nax
---
There's a lot of hints that they expected to have more. Why have shoulder enchants drop from the second to last boss in the game? Farming improvements for one final fight?
---
How's it work in modern WoW?
---
MC/BWL = Fire raid, AQ = Nature raid, Nax = frost/shadow raid
---
Kara = Arcane raid, Scarlet monastery raid = holy raid?
---
something like that would be cool
---
Very uncertain atm. I'm in North America but raid on EU times since NA raiding times don't work for me. But I'm afraid if I play on EU classic then it will be completely dead except for the early morning for me, when it's evening in europe.
---
I think she's taken already.
---
I will be getting a job soon  to get some pocket cash to finish my project car and I'm planning on not working the first 3-4 months that Classic launches. I just want to finally make it a reality to play Vanilla 24 fucking 7 and achieve a lot of things that I didn't have the time or knowledge back when I first played Vanilla in 2005.
---
Call me crazy but I just really *really* want to do this. I'm living at home anyway so I can get by with just a bowl of rice and a drink.
---
One of my best friends is like legit one of the top EU healers right now. If he can healbot me in battlegrounds I might actually reach Warlord for a week or two!
---
Classic can't come soon enough. This year is gonna be funtastic!
---
In my country/particular financial situation I would have to budget the cost into my monthly living. But I do agree it seems like a good deal. 
---
40 person Karazhan sounds tight af. 
---
Don't let your S.O. get in your way of WoW! I've been a hardcore lover of Vanilla WoW since I was young but it was a closet addiction. I'd never really talk about it in public and hide it from my previous boyfriends. 
---
I just started dating someone new and the first thing we bonded over our love of WoW. Didn't think the game could get more fun, but actually playing it with a S.O. that is a capable player is ENDLESS fun. Find yourself a girl that loves to play :)
---
Summer 2019 is the only official thing we have
---
Anything else is speculation.
---
For normal, lazy questing?
---
I don't recommend a warrior.
---
There was no item level in vanilla.
---
Grats better to remove junk before inventory gets full and you can keep collecting greens while questing.
---
Yea probably right :)
---
Oh hell yeah I’d love a Scarlet Enclave Raid.
---
&gt; "but, what's the point?"
---
She says as she selects The Office on Netflix yet again.
---
lol imagine having another gear set even more powerful then t3 in vanilla. warlocks killing people with one dot tick 
---
Yikes. 
---
Once Activision has achieved its final form 
---
&gt; very rough, not very player-friendly in certain aspects, missing a lot of QoL stuff that people are used to today. 
---
&gt; very rough around the edges
---
Are we talking about the same game?
---
Hey I just started a new shammy on a pserv too! I'm going enhancement and love it so far. What spec are you going? Also I'm sorry your girlfriend doesn't get the point. Not every female is like that though I can assure you ;) 
---
&gt; I think people say this more about endgame PvE than leveling.
---
Yeah, leveling is FAR from figured out. My current leveling pace is within a few hours of Joana's record, and I play paladin, the slowest leveling class out there.
---
Thank god my wife is that way. She was always worried that we didn't have too many common hobbies, but hobbies have nothing to do with love. It's really nice, we each have our own activities we can do alone without feeling like the other is missing out. It would eventually drive me nuts if she was on my discord/steam/battlenet/etc everytime I was. It's unhealthy to spend 100% of your time with *anyone*.
---
would be cool but the entire game would have to be revamped with that in mind. all of a sudden kara is the only raid that drops equel gear yet provides intresting spell effects which in the end would probably be way better then all the old gear. just like how call to arms and enigma is basicly a requirement for any pvp build in d2. but yes if someone made a private server with this in mind i would try it out
---
Or it could be niche items that let other speccs work, like just for instance something that helped shadow priests with mana regen (like a trinket on 2 min/1min 30 sec CD that worked similarly to a lifetap)
---
Or god-forbid PvP sets like the ZG/AQ sets
---
Lol I don't want to play with a broke NEET anyway so stay on your private servers 
---
Classic is a fresh start.  It's essentially a reset to 2004\* when the game was first released.  All of the servers will be new, and all of the characters with them.  When it is released, everyone will be in the same boat as you - starting the game.
---
As it is right now, the live version is all we can play.  But in the summer (or winter if you're far enough south) we will be able to play the Classic edition.
---
\*It won't be the same exact game as 2004, but it will be a similar situation.
---
And I made the post on Thursday night?
---
Exactly, you actively have to look for these comments. And to be completely honest, there is absolutely nothing wrong with saying “it’s so boring”, “people will just quit once the realize how hard it is”. Everyone is entitled to have and share their opinion. Yet people on this sub act like these comments are trying to ruin classic or whatever it's fucking embarassing.
---
As you said in this sub it is the complete opposite. Post and comments shitting on retail are upvoted to the top all the time.
---
Why would anyone take relationship advice from someone still living in fantasy land of perfect relationships without friction.  So you're bad with women.  I get it.  One day you'll learn to be a big boy.
---
PvE is very important for me, sorry.
---
However, I'm sure you'll find a PvP guild, even in our style. PvP seems to be much more popular around here.
---
yeah me and my friend would always dream about interesting items like a weapon that turns your target into an undead and thus allowing a ret paladin to use exorcism on him but he will be immune to fear
---
1. Classic was not hard. Unless you put down the difficulty slider, and compare LFR to classic raids, But, the hardest part of the game, aka raids, were easier. Classic raids were somewhere in between of today's Normals and Heroics. But, if we had such aids as item level, wowhead, icy veins or premade group finder, I think it would lower the difficulty to a normal level. Mechanics were definitely simplier in nature, though tougher in numbers - instead of spawning a pattern AoE inflicting 200 damage, they spawned one circle of AoE inflicting 1000. And, that can be overcame any way you want - by always watching for the AoE and not standing in it, by absorb shields, by resistances, by potions... in retail, we don't have such freedom - all encounters have a predesigned way of dealing with them, while in vanilla, encounters have predefined attacks instead. Retail is more arcade, vanilla is more like classic RPG. Retail is boulder dash, vanilla is dark souls.  
---
The thing was the drop rates and itemization. It was much harder to get an upgrade in your EQ.
---
2. Classic was not harder - was just more time-consuming, and less boring. Fights in retail WOW are basically timefillers. In WOW, when questing, fights are something I hate. Fights are the commercials of a TV show. In vanilla, they had some challenge to them. You had separate ways to deal - even when soloing, positioning mattered, rotation was different for each mob. On retail, you just repeat your DPS rotation over and over. Again, retail has predefined way to play, classic had predefined obstacles, but it was up to you how you overcome them
---
3. It's not that much about QoL - it's a completely different game. Retail is about FOLLOWING the game mechanics, while classic is about OVERCOMING them. Those who prefer retail, are just blind lazy followers.
---
&gt;I want this game to have a long life, and just classic wont supply that longevity. Eventually we need new content,
---
This was my first thought when they originally announced Classic, what do we do after X amount of time?....
---
&gt;I just hope that the new content from the expansions can be inserted in a way that suits the classic feel.
---
But this is where I disagree with you. Some of the raids and stuff were cool, but honestly I hate what they did w/ the lore after Vanilla, especially now, and I don't think that you can really have one (content), without the lore. Now, I am of course speaking for myself and this is just my opinion, but it's one that I feel very strongly about. 
---
Personally, I'm more for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9td7ca/classic_20_the_what_if/). Before anyone reads that though, I will say that the point of me making that post wasn't because I wan't "WoW 2.0", on the contrary, I want to take what made vanilla great (the danger the world presented, forcing social interactions, the "epicness" of it all) and exaggerate it. I want to make the world feel like a world again, add things to make it feel like it was the first time we played, a complete mystery and a world that we have to discover our place in while at the same time fixing some of the glaring problems vanilla had (coughhonorsystemcough). 
---
TBH I kinda love /u/FHenry13 's rant though. He makes a good point. Stand up for your hobbies :) 
---
You are forgetting the se is bonus to consider 
---
completely different level ranges
---
The true meta is getting them to play with you.
---
Yes, but you can get these with a mere 5 points in Fury and then get the rest of Arms. 
---
5% crit is simply a 5% damage increase unless you have something that procs off Crits, such as Enrage or Deep Wounds/Impale. If you don't have these, it's only around 5% more damage which is really not all that significant.

My eureka moment was finding a class I genuinely enjoy and think is cool and just made it "my class." As of a few months ago I'm a Troll Priest, nothing else, no alts, no *maybe Undead* or *maybe Shaman* or *maybe Alliance,* just Troll Priest. I level as shadow and gear/raid as holy. And I love it, so much more than stressing over class/spec/race/faction like I was stuck doing for ages. That single handedly made me more positive &amp; excited about Wow than I'd been in 5+ years, I enjoy it now like I did when I first started playing
---
My advice, pick a class you love and own it, find an anchor &amp; identity to call your own and use it to just enjoy yourself. It might not work for everyone, but I wish someone could have told me this a very long time ago. So even if it's worthless I hope it can at least give you some perspective. Cheers and good luck

It's a German side but the interesting part about the binary spells are in English.

When I played back in the day I never tested it myself.

I only tested it on the blizzlike private servers where I can confirm that the formula I wrote was used for binary spells.
---
yikes dude you are emanating narcissistic neck-beard hardcore 
---
I love playing vanilla WoW solo, but honestly I couldn't BELIEVE how much more fun it became playing with a bf who loves it as much as I do.
---
It is a silly concept propelled by individuals who arent looking at the bigger picture. 
---
Lets look at some facts:
---
People will hit 60 in 1-2 weeks.
---
Guilds will begin clearing MC in the first few weeks (if its released) and will have relative ease clearing with 35 people in greens. MC will begin to be pugged in the first month.
---
Why does this matter? Vanilla content is trivial by modern standards. Why are we arguing about trivial content being slightly more trivial through itemization? How about we focus on buffing the content to make it difficult to begin with. "Uhhh duh but it not easy for casuals, you just be hardcores!!!" No. Vanilla WoW is tuned for the bottom 5-10% of the playerbase. Just as retail vanilla is tuned to the bottom 5-10% of the user base. The difference is we have access to information stemming from the cumulative understanding of millions of players over the course of a decade... So the bar of mediocrity has been raised. We have classic. It will be there for a very long time. Why wouldnt you want it to be more challenging? Why wouldnt you want the game to have more longevity?
---
TLDR; itemization changing throughout patches might make the game 5-10% easier tops? The game is already relatively trivial so it doesnt matter. Focus your efforts on arguing for a more challenging game, not for itemization. Put the items into the game in their final form and tune around that.
---
Imagine those winding "staircases" with trash mobs constantly respawning until you reach the bottom to engage a boss! Or the basement filled with toxic magic slime with a nasty dot or debuff! Or an arcane resist fight!
---
Yeah prot can do respectable damage provided you a: have shield slam (usable in any stance) and b: maintain a really good 1h.  Can pull two at once, get a bit of extra rage from the 2nd mob and then be able to burn it down a bit quicker. 
---
Get her into playing with you! Questing/leveling with a S.O. is the best way imo. Unless she doesn't take it seriously that is. The grind is real.
---
She enjoys those terrible movie too. I like them too, I call them "Nap time movie" ahah. 
---
The entire point is to not make it *way better* than the old gear, at least not in all situations.  It's to keep the game fresh.  New items added to the game don't necessarily have to be in a tier 3 difficulty raid.  Put them in older content so you have a reason to run it again.
---
Here's another example: suppose there's a set of leather gloves with on equip: allows the wearer to equip 2h swords, axes, and maces.  Now you could be a 2H rogue.  Naturally, this would break the hell out of many rogue abilities and make them super OP... unless they took the time to normalize those abilities so that equipping a 2H is equal in DPS to two equal item-level weapons, and limits burst on abilities like ambush.  WoW devs have 15 years of experience balancing this kind of thing and have tools for simulating DPS and such that are way beyond what was available in 2004.  I am confident they'd be able to introduce "side-grade" style items that make the game interesting without making things too OP.
---
We arent talking about progressive content release. No one is arguing against that. We are arguing about progressive itemization. Progressive itemization is concerned with the change of stats on specific items as the game progresses.
---
BoSanc was changed later to give some mana on Dodge/Block/Parry. You're thinking of a passive called Touched by the Light for the heals --&gt; MP trick.
---
Otherwise, this is pretty much spot-on. Nice summary!
---
you can craft some decent weapons like arcanite reaper or rep rewards like unstoppable force. and you can get some decent pvp gear from the blue pvp set thats rank 7 to 10 or 11 i forget. but its still quite a grind but no you dont need to raid. but really i would just join a raiding guild and get something like bonereavers edge for example if your a warrior. like you really dont need to raid but pretty much every pvper either does raid or did raid to get some easier gear without having to grind months of battlegrounds 
---
Never said friction doesn't exist or disagreements aren't natural, but if someone questions your hobbies that are ultimately harmless then you should leave. Simple as that. Going "toe to toe" is not healthy and if it's the norm I suggest you find someone more compatible. 
---
Take advice from me, married for 10 years or this guy who thinks women are easily woo'd and able to be confused by his next level intellect. 
---
15? Daaaaamn, you were lucky. In my retail vanilla guild we had a warlock officer who was meleeing with a firestone. I'd say we had 15 competent players and that was by the standards back then... We had about 25 complete knuckle dragging retards to tote around with us. By todays standards, all 40 of us were buffoons.
---
What is your profile dude
---
Horde scum.
---
I can tell you plenty of reasons why you can play other games, but I can tell you plenty of reasons why to play the old World of Warcraft too.
---
But my right hand is the hand on my mouse! She games with me always, no exception.
---
And we still beat content. To be fair I was like 14 in molten core and I thought it was fucking awesome to expose armor on my rogue over slice and dice because; in my mind; it was fucking sick!!!!!! Vanishing into ambush mid combat like a BOSS. Running deadly poison and casting rupture cause thick damage!!!! I thought slice and dice was lame! And I was terrible. And there was a whole raid of us shitters beating content. Now go do mythic uldir and be like godddddamnnnn this shit is hard as fuck!
---
There is on the backend side and in game player won't see it, you can even sort by ilvl items on [https://classicdb.ch/](https://classicdb.ch/) and the old ilvl is somewhat "date added" type of value (like ilvl of blue Bloodvine set).
---
Wish I made a Tauren Pala thumbnail so y'all would get upset again 
---
No BGs or honor system at launch. So either PvE or stay in greens. Also, depending on your class, a lot of the BiS items for pvp are found in pve. It's also much easier to get PvE items than PvP items.
---
So it's up to you, but you'd be severely putting yourself behind by avoiding all PvE content. 
---
You're right, all narcissistic neck-beards provide sound relationship revelations.  Lovers will have points of friction.  To claim that one would not be in such a relationship suggests one has never been in any serious relationship.  Now, are there any other words you are fond of using incorrectly as labels in a vein attempt to be demeaning?
---
Call me a dick, sure.  Abrasive, absolutely.  But never, not mother fucking once, have legitimate ideas of narcissistic neck-beard been attached to someone who said (in summary) "If you're girl friend asks you the point of X you ask her the point of Y".  Only in the most infantile of minds can one muster the absurdity and audacity to link that line with being bad with women, or with being a narcissist.  
---
If you're going to throw out some "savagery", make sure they are applicable, or even hit the mark.  
---
non-early didn't released yet :) but soon... 
---
There are some very nice weapons you can get by gaining reputation with certain battlegrounds, other than that, you'll have to get to rank 14, which means having no life for 3 months.
---
Kolkar playable race please.
---
Thanks for the well thought out comment! I didn't really play much TBC, so I don't know the story well. I really enjoyed questing through those areas. The quests were challenging &amp; the zones were interesting &amp; unique.
---
I'll agree with you on Cataclysm zones. The Schnotzies were stupid as hell. I was still pretty young, so I don't remember the other zones being super silly.
---
Your last paragraph was the big point of my post. Tons of story retcons that were probably avoidable. It would be interesting to see the story unravel the Blizzard way over the Blizzard-Activision way.
---
What are you talking about? 1.10 Blues, Titanic Leggings, and the 1.11 PvP blue sets are some of the biggest cases of progressive itemization. 
---
Omnicast boots and Ban'thok Sash turn from garbage to great pieces. 
---
&gt; 5% crit is simply a 5% damage increase unless you have something that procs off Crits
---
Yea rage generation would fit that description
---
You can get gear with pvp either by ranking (for the better gear you will have to be able to play a lot and be geared already tho) or by getting exalted with a battleground faction (Somewhat fast for AV, really long for WSG and AB).
---
You might be able to do that without raiding (tho its highly recommended) but you will have at least to do some dungeons.
---
yeah that would be something im down with. theres this cool item that reduces i think time to be silenced by 1 second but the rest of the stats are ass. i would like to see more items like that in all raids 
---
Its constatly regenerate 1 energy/0,1sec (so 10energy/10sec), and with more Haste you will regenerate X more per /0,1sec.
---
From Wowpedia:
---
&gt;Haste also increases energy regeneration rate, but its effects are negligible unless your character stacks a considerable amount of Haste (regen rate increases by roughly 1 energy per second for every 10% Haste).
---
I would agree. Some people will thing it ruins the authenticity of the classic experience. But alot of people also just want a updated vanilla experience as well. Both could be good!
---
&gt;*But*, at the same time I hope they dont just insert the expansion the way it was done originally. Every expansion, every update and every feature made everything easier. I dont want everything to become easier. As you play longer you want new content to be hard, to be challenging. I want the content from TBC, WotLK, Cata, etc. to become available on these servers. I just want them to be formatted to fit classic. I want this entire concept of legeacy servers to become a complete do over for WoW. I just hope they can do that with the same classic feel.
---
I can say that. You think you do, but you don't.
---
And seriously, I don't want any level cap increase. Even if raids from next expansions get added, I don´t want the content retirement.
---
Though, Classic patches quite added some leveling content, especially post-50. Why not just make post-1.12 patches, instead of going for 2.0?
---
Right. At one point we'll get the infamous content overflow anyway. Unless...
---
Unless they are added as something like timeless isle. A catch-up meachanic, that would give you items that aren't as good as raid items, but give you something to do. Or, maybe more like reputation grinds than timeless.
---
The shameful shit-post dumping that is my true thoughts. I know its all over the place. ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Depends on a PVE vs PVP server and horde or alliance. If you are playing PVE then yes, healing classes may be more represented, slightly more so on alliance. If you are playing PVP, healing classes tend to be under-represented, especially on Horde as more players come with a PVP mindset and tend to roll non-healing classes.
---
A horde priest on a PVP server should always be in demand.
---
You can acquire some great blue gear from 5-man dungeons. So, it's not pure green gear.
---
No. I much prefer the original graphics. I don't want an option in the settings either.
---
I don't want the world or my character to look different to other people than it does to me.
---
I don't want to go on a classic stream and see BFA graphics.
---
&gt;Do you really want to devalue MC with DM loot
---
We arent talking about having DM loot with the launch of MC.
---
Can I ask you a question? I assume you want progressive content / itemization to preserve difficulty. But with there being no difficulty to begin with, would you rather have items in their final form and the content tuned to be more challenging?
---
Try your best to be kind when you do! And don't worry. My memory of vanilla had many relationships starting in WoW. 
---
Ideal solution would be a checkbox in Settings for "Use Vanilla textures". I have no idea how feasible that would be though.
---
This is the way I like it.
---
This mentality reminds me of when I would post incessantly about how I felt about Warlords of Draenor, and Classic isn't even out. We have no idea what the final build will look like and you're already here lamenting to new players about it being unfaithful. I think you're just miserable
---
That's the line in the sand?  Your Hamburger Hill?  The questioning of one's hobbies is the one thing you can't tolerate?  
---
I've been married for 11.  Guess my advice trumps your own.  Or perhaps, just maybe, the number of years one has been in a committed relationship has zero bearing to do with the argument at hand.  
---
Women have historically been easily woo'd, men have an even easier time of being cajoled into matrimony.  Did your wife do that?  Is she happy with her witless husband?  
---
... isn't that coming up pretty soon? I need to plan my vacation at work! Work with me Blizzard!
---
Yeah, I just assumed he didn't want to run PvE content at all. Either way, either raid in the first content patch, or get stuck at the bottom of the barrel when PvP becomes a thing during the next patch because everyone will be in raid gear and you'll be at best in blues. It's also probably more effort to farm 5mans for pre raid bis than just farming Ony and MC. 
---
You won’t because they won’t be there. Watch blizzard shut all them down when it’s out.

Damn Henry, why did you have to do him like that.

I don't care about the difficulty. It's not hard with or without. Some things just shouldn't be introduced too early. 
---
I care

Damn Henry I didn’t even make it down here to read your swift execution of this man.... guess you had to do it to em.
---
vanilla azeroth looks much better in my opinion then that wow has been for awhile. yes lower texture resolution, lower polycount, and other things but it has a much better style. 
---
Yeah, if you go far enough down you'll find rage comics. Who knew, shitposting since day one
---
Why? I get spell effects and such are fucking annoying. But why not better graphics?
---
I do like better graphics. I think vanilla graphics are better.
---
It has nothing to do with the build.  Classic could be patch for patch, bug for bug, day for day, to the T and it would fall short.  MMOs are not video games one can pick up again on a rainy afternoon and relive that time before.  Vanilla was never anything more than an interactive chat room firmly positioned in time to how people were then.  The gameplay was only the fluff and the community the ideas the people and guilds and how they interacted were what made Vanilla special.  That can never be recreated.  
---
If we go forward with the idea that Vanilla was a cultural experience and the game was simply the vehicle for that experience then we can assume Classic will be something entirely different.  Which is why I mention Classic could be fun, but we will never have Vanilla again.  Those who played Vanilla and are looking for that feeling again will not find it.  Those who are fresh to Classic will appreciate it for what it is without the muddy memories to taint the experience.
---
I think you read too much between the lines, enjoy sitting on your side of the fence and yelling too much at others without taking the time to think for more than five seconds that nothing said in those two sentences said anything more than Classic will be different than Vanilla.  I think your ability to read is quite limited.  You also probably have a crooked penis, and for that I am sorry.
---
Watch the Classiccast with John Staats. He explains it very well what was planned. Basically the final reason they didn't add an additional raid to Vanilla was powercreep. They thought about horizontal progression to counter that but concluded it was pretty lame to not get stronger items in a new raid. It wasn't an issue of time.
---
Are you following a specific guide, or just something you've figured out on your own? I'm currently leveling a paladin on a p server and while it's going okay I'm nowhere close to sniffing Joana's time. I'm almost level 40 for what it's worth. Appreciate any help mate :D 
---
Around 80-90% of the private server players will pay to play Classic...IF Blizzard manages to deliver a close as possible Vanilla-like Classic WoW.
---
Almost every single player I talked to since November 2018 said basically the same thing : " I am wasting time on p-servers until Classic hits". 
---
It is a no brainer. What the hell is $15/month today? Nothing.
---
Sure, some 10 years old might not...but private servers will be basically dead come this Summer.
---
Yeah my Reddit history is......interesting. Pretty embarrassing when I look back myself but I like the humiliation. Makes me appreciate the journey more and where I am now
---
Your view on women is quite troubling, as if gullibility is a universal trait to all females. You sound like you’re the typical red pill type, who doesn’t understand it. Have a good weekend.

I like the way you're thinking, it does show how much you've changed. I mean it is seven years or so of shitposts
---
It's for the same reason I don't post as much, though you'll find weird things in my comment section. These pictures on the top, is this some sort of meme I've missed out on? Could you explain it?
---
Honestly, it's $15 a month. Just try it when it comes out and see if you like it. Everyone on this sub is going to tell you that vanilla was the greatest game of all time, but the truth is, it had its flaws. Big flaws in game design, very simplistic combat. The gameplay is barely better than a turn based rpg. The graphics are horrendous by today's standards. 
---
But it's a role playing game. It brings every element of the genre to an online game, you will truly connect with your character and go on crazy adventures, some of which starting because some dude in a city corner told you to go speak to another dude halfway across the world. Some of which because you'll group up with someone and end up playing half a day straight with them, going from zone to zone, forgetting the reason you even grouped up in the first place.
---
TL;DR Just try it, it's $15 for a month, you'll know within a few days whether you like it or not. 
---
Im curious because i see so many people including you bring this up so i want your opinion.
---
Why do you want an emerald dream expansion? Isnt the emerald dream, lore wise, like the first backup of azeroth? Before anything evil happened, its a pristine copy of azeroth. 
---
If that’s true, then what on earth would there be to do in there. Fight animals, maybe trolls if they were around? Were they? Would the enemy of the expansion be an emerald nightmare? I feel like we’d need more than that for a whole xpac. Just look how boring orcs got in wod. 
---
To be honest i think we already had our emerald dream expnsion come and go, it was called mists of pandaria. The land behaved differently based on the emotions of the invaders. The sha’s got stronger the more hate there was, and stuff like that. That sounds exactly like what the emerald dream would be, changing based on who was in it. If you think about it, it would be pretty similar to mop i think.
---
What are your thoughts?
---
I don't know where you got that screenshot, but I'm running the game at 1920x1080, not 500x400.
---
The point of a job is to get money not be challenging. 
---
My GF is the only reason I will be able to play classic. 
---
Without her, I have very little standing in the way of playing every waking moment and flunking out of business school.
---
Actually, its the other way around.
---
This game is for the casual gamer.
---
its bad resolution but look at the style its all wrong. its all purple and trying to hard to be this like kiddy haunted mansion type crap
---
I hate the new graphics, they're just too cartoony and it really kills the immersion for me.
---
I also don't want a toggle option for new graphics, sorry.
---
It sounds anal af but I want a true 1:1 replication of the original game wherever possible, otherwise what is the point?
---
I think it'll be more fair to show the differences between goldshire now and then since they haven't had any major rebuilding.
---
Im so glad my gf dosnt care about me playing. We just moved in together, and of course i cant #nolife anymore like I use too, but when i get to playing at night or on the weekends she dosnt care. She does care if the games get into the way of our social life (going out, getting food, grabbing some drinks) but thats understandable and i wouldnt want to do that anyways.
---
What i keep to a minimum is putting the headset on and talking to my friends while playing. Ill only do that 2x a week or so.
---
We still cook together, watch sports together, go out with friends, go out just us two, so its honestly a good healthy balance. Sometimes she watches me (currently playing eve online) and asks me questions about what im doing/whats going on and i love it.
---
.... she also knows if she ever told me to stop playing for good she would need to find another SO. 
---
k
---
Depends on how you gauge being successful. I gauge success on constant improvement and happiness. Money for me has always been a relatively low priority of mine, just turns out that development pays well.
---
It has to be done. Just remember guys, a GF is replaceable... becoming a Grand Marshal of the Alliance is forever. Can you imagine the journey to rank 14 while having to also care for the needs of a GF? It cannot be done. Clean break, right now. 
---
I've done this back in Vanilla with extreme effectiveness and lots of fun. So I'll keep throwing this idea out there:
---
Dual wielding 2x super fast daggers. Literally something with 1.30 or maybe 1.40 attack speed. I think there's also some one-handed swords which  have super fast attack speed.
---
Stack as much agility on your gear as you can, spec into crit nodes, race to get flurry. After that pick any talents of your desire.
---
This is basically *the* rogue-in-plate build. Your main damage comes from constant white crit hits. It's fucking insane how good crit and attack speed scales with a warrior. And if you pair up with an enh shaman for the WF totem then everything just melts, solidifies, then melts again just because.
---
Unfortunately fast daggers are somewhat hard to come by from quests so you'll need to be sniping the AH and picking up  good deals. You'll be competing with rogues so...
---
I do prefer 2H overall, but only for Mortal Strike in PvP.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
This comment hurts because it's true.
---
Leveling a shaman is one of the most fun things to do in WoW, playing end game though....
---
Cleric prebis is character selection screen -&gt; delete character -&gt; DELETE
---
I get your angle, but to quote you, I think you're reading too far between the lines. I don't think the point you're trying to get across is going to be particularly relevant in Classic. And nobody has to read between any lines to tell that you're unhappy when you act like this over video games and Reddit posts
---
My personal experience: arms is more streamlined and much more balanced for pvp encounters and tanking dungeons. Two things that you will do a fair amount of, granted you play on a pvp server. Having done both on retail and p servers, I just dont find 2h fury that much better for damage or rage generation.  What's great for rage generation is killing mobs that are a couple levels lower than you. Easier to kill, and if you pull an accidental 2nd or 3rd mob, you'll likely plow through them without dying. But that's a good tip for whatever spec you play. Sounds like arms is for you, based on your post. Although 2h fury in raids is pretty sweet. Maybe not quite as high dps as dw, but you get to roll on those sweet 2hs and not worry about the MS debuff. 
---
The view where I said you should address her like an equal?  Or the one where you challenged that ladies could love a man like that, and my rebuttal with men and women have been easily fooled into love since time immemorial?  That makes me sound like a, what was it, a red pill type?
---
Everyone and anyone is gullible when it comes to love.  Brilliant women and men do stupid shit to chase that feeling.  
---
So tell me how it's troubling for how I see women.  
---
Yikes. Some quality cringe material here. 
---
Pretty much everything. It is a social game, first and foremost.
---
also i dont get it? i sided with you saying vanilla is way better looking as it has better style, even if they have lower texture resolutions and lower poly counts
---
People always downvote but I loved leveling as DW.
---
After getting overpower talented it just sliced through mobs, was a blast to play since it procs so often.
---
Stock up on trolls blood potions, combined with blood craze and blood thirst you can just bounce between mobs - all those small healing numbers add up while grinding.
---
You are talking about things you never experienced. The difference between a piece of gear that last you for a week, and one that lasts you for 30 minutes is huge.
---
In Classic, you will EVENTUALLY replace gear, but that eventually is far, far longer in Classic compared to retail. Hence, much more VALUABLE.
---
Can you see that? Or still not?
---
yea but the parts that have new textures and models dont fit old wow
---
Diablo Immortal will make more revenue than WoW Retail and WoW Classic combined, that is why they are going to make mobile games for all their IPs.
---
America and European market is a big joke against the Chinese market.
---
If this all about business, you would have never needed Classic at all as a company. 
---
WoW Classic and W3 are here for marketing and the money they make is for the costs. You know you got to pay the people who are currently working on WoW Classic. This project is at the moment a big red number with a minus.
---
So no, it's not about "in terms of business", mobile games are about the business. Micro-Transactions are about the business.
---
I don't want fans of WoW Retail to feel alienated from a company, because I think WoW Classic is better. Neither version is better and neither version needs to be fixed or changed.
---
It is what it is. 
---
I thought you were sarcastic because you posted a low resolution picture
---
Three minutes of typing is hardly a temper tantrum for the unhappy.  You'll need another angle.  
---
That point is completely relevant to Classic. it could not be more relevant.  
---
na i just copy and pasted 2 images i found on the web to compare the styles 
---
Right now I’m looking at BM Hunter, Sub Rogue, or Enh Shaman. I hear hunters fall off in the end game content but I should be able to do well enough in the beginning to get a decent weapon, right? 
---
Another witless wonder.
---
The only consistent thing about the WoW community is that everybody thinks they know what's best for the game and community and then they conflate themselves to be representative of the majority of players.
---
Personally I would love some love tap buffs to make hybrid dps better, the removal of world buffs, removal of debuff slots and just an overhaul of boss numbers to make the fights interesting, but making more classes and specs viable.
---
It will be hard, not mechanically, but in other ways.
---
Much harder than retail anyway, for most people. But also much more rewarding.
---
Which is why Vanilla is more popular today than retail, and it isn't even launched on Blizzard servers.
---
My gf tries to get into video games, she spooks easily and hates dying so she’s way too cautious. Nonetheless I play games and she does her thing when I’m gaming.
---
&gt;I don't care about the difficulty. It's not hard with or without. Some things just shouldn't be introduced too early. It makes for a better game...
---
Huh? You dont care about the difficulty. So how does it make for a better game? What about progressive itemization makes the game better if you arent doing it in an effort to preserve difficulty?
---
Yeah I see what you mean now
---
Unfortunately, as soon as T2 is available PVE gear is too strong for PVP, forcing many to raid.
---
That was one of the main beefs with Vanilla system and why BC got the PVP stat in PVP gear.
---
I 100% agree. People seem to want this perfectly replicated patch cycle that vanilla went through because “duh but it should be de same as it was wen it came out” Spoiler alert, It’s not the fucking same and never will be. The more reasonable thing to do would be tuning the earlier content to the itemization and talents of 1.12, but god forbid people don’t get the exact 2004 time travel experience that they feel so entitled to.
---
Thanks. Very informative post.
---
OHHHH YEA. Well both games (vanilla retail and modern retail) are tuned for the bottom 5-10% of the playerbase. The difference is that the competence of the average player has increased.
---
i didnt play bfa, i only went back to retail for legion and left after seeing how the devs changed things around so much when they had beta servers to figure shit out ahead of time
---
What current textures? Most of the old world still looks like blobs on retail. 
---
it snot anal at all. already they are using slightly different graphics but i think its all the same models and texture just with a few different shading and different water textures. so far it looks similar to classic but you cant hide in water anymore which is a big change. but if they went full bfa? yuck dude no way that looks like a completely different game
---
It makes perfect sense to add Atiesh to Naxx. 
---
They were giving people a free teleport to Kara, which was the first of the T4 instances. E.g. the next raid tier after Naxx. 
---
Why would it need to be a 40 man for that reasoning to still be valid?
---
Says the guy pulling random words out of a dictionary in a vain attempt to sound smarter than they actually are. 
---
Certain items invalidate content. That's bad for the game. 
---
But you'll still get your 1:1 replication, why impose something onto others what they do not want? 
---
I for one enjoy the older graphics but if others don't who am I to decide for them? 
---
ARMS. Contray to popular opinion, missing 90% of your attacks as DW fury before 50+ is aids. Arms has its power surges too, especially with WW axe. Sometimes you will miss / parry / dodge a mob 5 times in a row. Another time you will 2 shot them. 
---
Drek is about 15 years old as well.
---
hahaha they're wikihow images. Its for the sub r/disneyvacation which I got into around this time last year. Very fun and easy to make OC for it so I do it from time to time. 
---
Basically all it is is finding terribly drawn images on [wikihow.com](https://wikihow.com) (almost every article on it has them) and then re-captioning the image like its for a different 'how to' article. A lot of the posts to the sub are pretty meh, so I like going really specific and dark with mine. [here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/disneyvacation/comments/86l0nt/how_to_make_use_of_your_paralyzed_son_when_you/)
---
Nothing was particularly uncommon.  Nor did I have to sit down and look any up.  The time between posts is rather quick as well.  I'm sorry your vocabulary is that of an uneducated peasant.
---
The best way I've found is Fury until you can get MS then go Arms.
---
Maybe next time you should double-check your dictionary to make sure you use the right 'vain' and not "vein", dumbass.
---
I wasn't crazy about the linear direction Blizz took with the expansions to begin with, and I have far less faith in them now than I did then. Having some content added somewhere down the line sounds nice, but look where that got us last time. Honestly, I'll be happy just to have classic forever. 
---
I count myself lucky, I told my. Gf about classic and her response was "I wanna play a rogue, can we play Alliance?" 
---
i remember on forums back in 2009 asking for old wow server and i always thought why do they say no, they dont have to play it if they dont like it. well now we are getting classic and now we also want blizzard to make new bfa graphics to go along what they already gave us? i say we should try to make the game good and like classic wow instead of asking blizzard to give us new graphics or optional transmog or optional other things
---
Because Atiesh had no lore relevant to nax, but it did to Kara. Why wasn't it a drop/quest in Kara? Too early for legendaries in the newest expansion from first raid maybe, so they put it in nax.
---
&gt;Why would it need to be a 40 man for that reasoning to still be valid?
---
It wouldn't have to be, next content sure, is a valid explanation. But content in the next expansion just seems weird.
---
&gt;I hope We will have equally high pop servers on the Blizzard servers to experience that glorious shitshow once again, truly an epic MMORPG experience.
---
I really wouldn't hold out too much hope for something like that.
---
You have either never played Vanilla or you are very ignorant 
---
Classic doesn’t need new content 
---
If it did there wouldn’t be Private servers that have been going for almost ten years now 
---
&gt;They thought about horizontal progression to counter that but concluded it was pretty lame to not get stronger items in a new raid. It wasn't an issue of time.
---
So adding 10 new levels isn't power-creep?
---
and the problem with adding new expansions is that all the old content becomes instantly obsolete, besides lvling dungeons.
---
The general consensus seems to be a toggle or no.
---
Personally I'm for the toggle option. But I can understand the, but blizzard will ruin everything once you open the doors argument.
---
Just take your L my man, just walk away.
---
TIL: fires in retail doesn't do damage.
---
I've never played end game shaman so I'll probably be in for a surprise lol. I typically end game Rouge.
---
Yess! well played.
---
You lot have it right. Google/America is wrong. We know how they like to mess up date formats. Unsurprisingly they mess up seasons too. (I mean you have summer in winter but besides that)
---
I never mentioned an Emerald Dream expansion. It could maybe be a zone or a place to get quests or maybe even a raid. I wouldn’t put that many eggs into 1 basket haha.
---
That’s a cool idea you brought up about Mists. I see the similarities, but it brought up important pieces of lore with the Klaxxi and the dead old god. I think there should have been a town somewhere in some expansion with Pandas, not a whole expansion around it.
---
&gt; Are you really that bad with women that you think it is somehow a difficult task to befuddle their minds and woo them?
---
Mate it's a troll.
---
Its 2019 and private servers can hold pops of 15k people, so why shouldn't Blizzard be able to as well?
---
Sure, some people enjoy low pop, but I'd like to play on the highest pop possible with good a/h ratio, as it truly made the game feel more alive than it ever did on even retail back in the days.
---
Been building a guide of my own. Mix of grinding and max XP quests per zone.
---
I've got a formula for XPH I need: 1500 + (level * 700) --- If a quest doesn't meet those requirements, or I can't double up quests in a similar area to get to that metric, I look for other options.
---
__________________________
---
Example: At level 19, math says I want 14,800xph
---
In Redridge, I can do Blackrock Menace for 1,650 xp, assuming 20 kills for the 10 drops, that's 2,700xp for kills, and about 15 minutes spent. Normalized, that's 17,400xp per hour. 17% ahead of schedule.
---
I can get 18-20,000+ grinding Troggs in Loch Modan at this point if its not camped (shouldn't be if I'm rushing right) - or Tranquil Gardens Cemetery.
---
___________________
---
Still in the early phases of making my own run guide. Ideally, I'll have 3 distinct options at any given point. If A isn't giving the XPH I want due to congestion, etc try option B.
---
Oh shit, ya got me.  With zingers like that no one will be able to stop you.  Your chest feel puffed up?  Or is that the wheezing your lumbering lungs labor out while you climb a flight of stairs?
---
Reddit is brimming with billions of typos.  Should check my other posts to find more discrepancies my little detective.  People who proof read reddit trash talk are... (what's a word I can use that you won't have to copy, right click, google...hmm?) stupid.
---
tl;dr
---
That sums up your education nicely. 
---
I normally level specced for pvp because the slightly more efficient kill speed of the perfect build is no where near as satisfying as beating that alliance scum who thinks he'll try to ruin your day. 
---
And people who go on mega rants like you on most posts you make *aren't* stupid? lol. You definitely are a neckbeard like the other guy was saying. 
---
I think the lack of demons in Vanilla was meant as a relief to the ending of WC3. It kind of showed that there were more local threats to take care of &amp; they needed to expand the world a bit. I do agree though that there wasn’t even a dungeon of demons...
---
The old gods having their own expansion could homogenize things for a fair amount of time. They’re also manipulators, so it makes sense to have those they manipulated be just before or after them.
---
hunter scale the worst with better equip, so skipping raids has the least impact of all classes
---
but in general you can do proper pvp until the majority of your opponents are AQ geared, and even then the r12-r14 gear can still make up for the difference
---
with nax gear youll get outclassed big time
---
Vanilla was designed for expansions. I get what you’re saying tho!
---
Thank you for sharing your previous experience. I also hope for starting zones sharding, I have a hard time seeing how I would get my warlock imp if there is a line up of 20 more people waiting to kill the same quest mob.
---
Your comment on blizz server made me laugh but I hope your wrong.
---
I sat down with my wife and told her what was up, summer of 19’ don’t expect me to be hanging out on the couch watching movies and TV all the time. Except for when Game of Thrones comes on my ass will be in Azeroth
---
Deep balance sure but you go pretty far into the tree for pvp
---
A rant is a long drawn out post with many paragraphs that someone uses to get an issue off their chest.  Multiple replies is just not taking shit from bitchmade illiterates like yourself.  
---
you can get the hunter bow very easy from the ony drop. and as a hunter you will always have a place in the game even if your dps falls off later on. but yes join a guild do a few onys and youll have your hunter weapon in no time. you could even pug it but the problem is you will have to compete with new hunters rotating into the raid who will roll against you, compared to as a guild you sort of work together when someone gets loot, it only means u will get it next or close, while pug you could never get it unless u reserve. you can even get tier 1 hunter gear very easy from mc.
---
also ele shaman completely superior to enh shaman. i mean i love windfury in vanilla because its funny but slowly walkign towards ur enemy auto attacking fishing for a wf proc is just crap compared to blowing someone up with lightning bolt and chain lightning. also all your pro damage scales with heals and you get sick off heals, enh you are all str and agility and attack power, barley any spell damage gear so no off heals. low mana pool too. again its a fun gimmick spec but if you plan to be a pvp guy i wouldnt recommend enh as a main spec 
---
If technically feasible without giving either side an edge, I'd absolutely approve of this. Would please fans of fanciness and the #nochanges faction alike.
---
isn't it pretty weird for a sign in the Thousand Needles to be pointing towards Goldshire?
---
Well Horde side your not getting Judgement of Light at number 11. Assuming that is what JOL is. So maybe your right maybe he's not forgetting but their is no way I would think. Corruption over nightfall either though.
---
Arms with 2 handers and knowing what the right weapons to get is my best advice.  And really, hamstring kiting makes leveling way way way easier and is really easy to get the hang of.
---
Early on use rend up until lvl 30-36ish and dump with heroic strike.  Sweeping strikes + cleave at 30 is good for multiple mobs.  After that you can stance dance and whirlwind on cd while hamstring kiting if you really want, and incorporate ww with sweeping strikes.  Swap with mortal strike at 40.
---
If you just want to sit there and exchange auto attacks and pop your abilities then go ahead I guess.  It'll work, it just isn't nearly as efficient as just simply hamstring kiting and skipping the fancy stuff.
---
I'm all for the toggle option, but it shouldn't be a priority. I don't want it to delay release.
---
My question is, what percentage of vanilla models, textures and animations have been updated? I know most models and animations have been, but the gear models haven't, or many bosses like Nefarian...
---
Not this time! Huzzahhhh. 
---
Which is exactly what you're doing, lol. 
---
I still don’t like the caverns of time. As soon as you introduce time travel into a story, you’re fucked. It would make sense to be able to maybe relive events as practice, or to understand the past instead of changing it.
---
aah you mean exactly this one
---
I thought you meant using signs at all
---
yea you can always join a guild when its time to regear again 
---
focus on difficult mechanics, not higher numbers. 
---
It's still only 5%. One in 20 attacks. With a 3.0 speed weapon (though most 2h will be much slower) that's one crit every full minute of fighting that crits for double rage.
---
Less than one crit per minute on average is not significant when it comes to levelling in comparison to other talents. It's GOOD yes, but it's not point for point miles better than any of the other talents on offer.
---
Critting is awesome and the lifeblood of a warrior, but 5% is 5%.
---
Absolutely, 100%, yes.
---
Other posters are focusing on the sources for the best possible pvp gear, pointing out that AQ40 gear outstrips even the rank 14 pvp gear, etc...
---
But in Classic, people won't have the best gear. Every single battleground is going to have some numb nuts running around in absolutely terrible green gear. The "good" gear takes such an enormous time investment to acquire that an enormous portion of the community is never going to acquire it. If you are grinding for rank 14 in premades, then yeah, you might "need" to go get X weapon from BWL or something. But there is not rated pvp. Even with just the rank 10 gear and one of the freebie weapon epics, you are going to be in the top 10-20% of geared players in any given random BG.
---
I'm not sure whether the honor system will be implemented at launch or not, but eventually the honor system WILL come in. Essentially you get honor from killing players on the opposing faction. The more honor you gain, the higher you climb on the "ladder". At the end of each week the game divvies up the ladder and gives everyone a rank, 1-14, based on where they fell on the ladder in terms of total honor earned over X amount of time. Between ranks 7-10 you'll gain access to a pvp vendor who will sell you 2 pieces of a blue pvp set, and ranks 11-14 give epic gear. (rank 11 might be a blue weapon I'm not sure). 
---
Succintly: Yes, you will absolutely be able to effectively participate in PVP without ever setting foot in a raid if you want to. You'l probably still need to do a couple of dungeons and whatever to get geared up to begin climbing the honor ladder, but raiding is definitely not mandatory.
---
You're in luck, rogues don't need gear: [https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=84](https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=84)
---
I'll abandon privates if Blizzard does classic the right way.
---
Unfortunatelly, I'm not with high hopes of this. The whole using 7.x client, loot trading and sharding thing will pave the way to more crappy changes IMO.
---
But if they really surprise me and give me an authenthic enough experience, I'll stay with Blizzard and never look back.
---
I think they changed that in 1.2
---
Sure thing.  How's stocking those shelves?
---
Without heirlooms ofc. If you wear them it's instant obviously :3
---
Official Classic wow isn’t released yet but you should definitely give it a go when it comes out. Honestly I think it’s pretty good for new players but you’ll be levelling slower than most players that know the optimal method and tricks etc. But you’ll still have a lot of fun.
---
You're going through a massive effort to troll. How's flipping burgers?
---
Warrior had a innate 40% miss chance on 2h weapons when WoW launched. That’s was how I leveled to 60. 
---
&gt; The discrepancy between characters and the power they gain during an expansion is just too high.
---
The power curve throughout the duration of a retail xpac since MOP is absolutely mind boggling.   Using just legion as an example:  You've heard of blood dks, tank DHs, hunters, etc soloing raid bosses in the past at the end of xpacs (and a few exceptional players able to do it when content was current)?  
---
Well, I was able to solo the first raid boss in Legion (Nythendra in EN), as a *ret paladin*...before the last raid of the xpac was out (during TOS)....and I was able to do it as fast or faster than our raid killed it during EN progression.  Think about that for a second.  As a single, self buffed DPS player, I was able to do as much or more dps, in the second to last raid of the xpansion...not even the capstone raid...as *our entire raid group* did at the start of the xpac and was also able to actually mitigate and heal through the damage as a solo dps player with only self buffs and regular raid consumes.  No xploits, no "creative use of game mechanics", etc.
---
Hell, at the end of retail legion, I was so geared I could 1 shot low geared players/fresh 120s with just judgement (when it crit, to clarify) on my ret pally.  
---
Old Thousand Needles!
---
&gt;Does it make you feel smart?
---
No, the fact that I am smarter than you and your buddies here, doesn't make me smart, in the same way that being smarter than a turd doesn't.
---
&gt;So if they know nothing about the game how do they know it gets replaced later?
---
Because the aforementioned mental turds will throw such a big hissyho about getting their way that everybody would know. And even idiots can use wowhead (that's why there are big flashy buttons all over the page, specifically crfated for people like you)
---
&gt;They are going to want to start getting MC loot asap and to do that you need to compete with other players that are gearing up.
---
Because if other players go to MC, I can't go to MC? Thanks for establishing your inability to reason again.
---
You know what, beat it. You can't win here, and this discussion is moot anyway, because there will be no progressive itemization.
---
I just hope we don't have to choose between right values with sharding, or wrong values with no sharding, etc
---
I think the real problem comes with the entire concept of a level cap.  They are arbitrary and artificial, and completely immersion breaking.  The best pre-WoW MMORPGs that I played were MUDs that had no caps on levels or character skills, but limited progression by scaling roughly logarithmically.  After a certain point, increasing an increment of the effectiveness of a skill would require ten times the amount of leveling, the next increment would require 100 times the effort, the next 1000, and so on.  It made it so that there was never a true cap on character growth, just an exponential amount of effort required to get to that next increment.
---
Even though it would change the entire concept of the game, I would love to see something similar implemented where the hard level cap is completely removed while retaining the level 60 cap on gear requirements.  It would create a soft cap where level 60 is the highest level you need to use the strongest weapons and armor in the game while still allowing from character growth without completely obsoleting all the work you put in to get that gear in the way that Hellfire Peninsula greens did for classic raid purples.
---
Of course you don't have to raid. You don't HAVE to do anything. 
---
Once the pvp system is out there are pvp vendors by the bus (you'll need rep), the rank armor vendor (the blue set is comparable to t0.5), the weapon vendor (rank 14) you can also craft some decent weapons. Or be 'fine' with BoEs on the auction house.
---
A friend an I have a fond memory of him playing his enh shammy in wsg and a r14 warrior was beating him to death, and my friend had a sliver of life, up against the ropes, then all a sudden he got a massive stromstike multiple windfury proc and killed the warrior. My friend was rocking the twig of the world tree and dungeon gear (he also hated raiding) 
---
Of course most of the time the bis gear is in raids though. And the longer you go without raiding the more disadvantage you put yourself in as the patches are released.
---
Same effort as you.
---
I agree, classic is a far better game. The only thing I like more about any of the future expansions is that in tbc there are no total trash specs
---
Oh well that and having a high geared haste specced enh shaman in wotlk back when haste was fun and you could get the fist weapon procs+winfury procs+ there was that awesome trinket proc... So many numbers 
---
but the goldshire from what ive seen online is the same texture and model as the original one. maybe it has slightly different shader but how is that bfa graphics? bfa graphics are things that have new texture and model. so add bfa graphics to the game but only things that have the same texture and model as vanilla?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9AN5Y4ZdHE theres already a small difference now with vanilla and classic. i guess that is bfa graphics?
---
Didn’t they remove the mobile AH from retail? I highly doubt they would bring it back for classic, which never had it at all. As for there being an armory, that might be cool
---
Ditto what /u/logsp just said:   Anything tips you care to share for the vanilla pally players of the world?  
---
A girl I used to date didn't understand why I played SW:G. Didn't even bother to try and understand why I wanted to play it or even video games in general.
---
My wife encourages me to game, when she stops playing Spyro lol, because its a hobby. I'm home with her and our kids and because I'm smart about it I usually don't spend a lot every year on games after using trade credits and sales.
---
Accusing the opponent of being mad is one way of demonstrating ones inablity to reason.
---
The fact that you are unable to even understand my post, cements the impression further.
---
Some will go hardcore. Spme, spread over a lot of servers and millions of players. Some are not enough.
---
Spare me another answer, it hurts to read stupidity.
---
Armory was introduced in tbc. Mobile armory I think was cata. Mobile AH won’t work because until the end of classic the AHs were separate for each major city. For alliance Ironforge was the most popular AH.
---
I want the triple stacked pygmys from Uldum
---
There was something like this towards the end of cata and I remember it not being great. Anytime you did something wrong on a fight or got loot someone else wanted you’d get thumbed down a ton. Then again raid finder was a thing then so maybe it would be different. The issue with that is that unless you’re a star player you probably won’t get good reviews, but if you do something that slightly annoys someone else they’ll be quick do leave a bad one.
---
Yep I'm the same... We need to start a cult. We all agree to abandon our current lives and pool all our money together to buy a house and enough food to sustain us years of wow. 
---
It isn't even Spring yet.
---
You got time to plan it. And don't worry about missing the release date news, it will EXPLODE on this subreddit once we know.
---
I see my bad!
---
As much as I loved TBC kara (best raid in vanilla-wotlk timeline imo), it doesn't belong to vanilla. Whatever activision decides to do with vanilla post-naxx is their business, but basically kara has no place in vanilla
---
Never underestimate the power of a small group for deterring gankers in certain zones. I find partnering up in say Stranglethorn or Arathi to be pretty beneficial overall. Plus in zones like Arathi there are a huge numer of elite quests that require 4 or people to do and can occupy a few days play time easily.
---
Totally agree. I think one of the main problems are that people have become so used to being spoon fed.
---
Some people work to live.
---
Some people live to work.

Others have a mix somewhere in-between.

Well I think we are interpreting what OP is asking differently. Does he want new models, ever updated buildings like what you depicted, because I think that's how you're interpreting his question. I'm viewing it as keep everything the same except models that have been directly updated. Keep vanilla as vanilla, but if there's a post that looks the same but with more polygons and higher resolution, then use that... Idk, I think OP should have been more clear with his question.
---
I think both of those things are bad for the game and shouldn't be developed.  
---
Armory expands the meta-game and detracts from the actual game.  Lets say you want to interview a new DPS or Tank or Healer or whatever, what sounds more fun: Go online and look them up in the armory or send them a group invite, meet them in the world, inspect them.  
---
Mobile AH also detracts from the game, let me demonstrate with a story.  Back in 2005 I decided to roll horde for the first time as a shaman.  I was messing around with engineering and realized that a copper blunderbuss was selling for 2g apiece in the AH.  
---
That was an amazingly profitable recipe and so I spent an hour ghost-wolfing around for copper and made 10 blunderbusses.  They all sold in an hour.  I made 20 more blunderbusses and they all sold in an hour.  
---
I noticed this time that all of the guns had been purchased by a guy named "Muleborn".  Interesting.  I also noticed that all of the current lowest auctions were from Muleborn.  The next day I made 30 blunderbusses and I got a letter from Muleborn telling me that I was invading his turf and if I wanted to get into a price war, we could do that, but I wasn't going to win.
---
I counter-offered telling him that I would sell him blunderbusses for 1.5g each, COD via mail, and in return I wouldn't undercut him on the AH.  This worked for a week before he stopped paying the COD.  
---
Not wanting to end up with a bunch of my work stuck in his mail box for a month, I started listing blunderbusses on the AH, since he'd broken the deal . He undercut me immediately.  So, I added him as a friend so I could monitor his activity.  For the next week I did test posts online and found out that he was playing between 3pm and 1am my time, every day, with a check in around 9am my time.  
---
Using this information I had several great weeks of undercutting him just before bed, selling 3-4 blunderbusses a night.  Since I was only posting when he was offline, and only posting a few at a time, it was rare that one of my auctions would still be up by morning and so it was very hard for him to fight me on price.  
---
If we had mobile AH at the time, none of this would have been possible.  
---
Good on you for dropping a toxic bitch, OP.
---
Just ignore the incel losers in this thread.
---
How? Here is an example: http://www.gamerassaultweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/new-models.jpg
---
I particularly find the dark ones funny, like the one you linked me, amazing content. So you go hunting for content filled Wikihows then, or do you just happen to find something while searching?
---
The set in the thumbnail is from Legion. If you don't fix it and make it context-appropriate, I'm gonna have to take legal action. You have 24 hours. My attorneys are waiting.
---
but even in your example the texture and model is the same for goldshire inn. (i dont know about inside as im only looking at pictures from outside) if you went and extracted that model and opened up its texture it would litterly be the exact same thing as the vanilla one. theres no more polygons or updated texture here
---
1. In the army
---
2. Have a gf
---
3. Gym 6 days a week
---
4. Strict diet to stick to
---
Feels bad man... I know ill never clear nax but that won't stop me from aspiring to it! 
---
Well maybe, if it forces you to type in why you downvoted and that shows your review for them would help keep that from happening. Because the goal isnt to weed out bad players, I dont even think I'll be that great. I'm hoping it would lean more to actually being used to weed out players with like toxic attitudes, ninja looters, ninja groups (since that two hour trade to other players in the group thing is going to be in classic supposedly). Etc, but I do see what you mean.
---
And again I think if you wanted to rep someone, either up or down. You would have to give a typed review with idk like a 20 character minimum of letters. So it kind of makes people that just want to downvote someone just because they didnt like the dude for no good reason less likely to actually doing it vs someone repping someone down for being a ninja
---
I like this idea.
---
There we go. I was wondering when there would be a post-naxx thread today. Almost missed it!
---
Lets expand on that idea. How do they invalidate content?
---
Nothing imho
---
If one warrior in your raid has all the best gear they can get pre raid, and another is waiting for some gear to come out two months later, then the one who put in the effort will top the dps meters and likely get given the gear. 
---
How can you not understand that?
---
Admit it, you are just a noob who doesn't know shit about the game trying to start arguments.
---
I think mobile AH launched in Cata.  Mobile AH was retired last year for "retail,"  and for that reason I am 100% certain it will not be making a return for  classic.  Mobile AH is not classic.  However, mobile armory I think would be absolutely fine.  I think the armory was introduced just before TBC (IIRC) and it was a quantum leap for the game to be able to look at other peoples specs/builds/gear/enchants.   Not supporting mobile armory for classic wouldn't do much at all unless all classic characters were not accessible on the armory AT ALL, because people would just view the armory through chrome on their phone.  
---
All that said, I have fond memories of sitting in the break room at work going through all my auctions.  At the time (during cata I think) I was buying up arcane crystals for super cheap and transmuting them into arcanite - and making elementium bars and selling them to people making their thunderfury's.  I'd often see arcane crystals for a couple gold a piece.... ah the good ole days.  
---
I hated that pvp stat resilience they added in tbc.  
---
The fact I HAD to have separate sets and dedicate even more time to the game really upset me and my friends. Spend months putting a set together in pve, you'll get owned in bgs. Spend weeks getting your pvp set, you are one of the lowest on the meters in raids. 
---
This was the only reason I disliked TBC. (And flying mounts killing wpvp.)
---
Wow those people really didn't like telling them they were looking at a blob on a white canvas, because it was obviously deliberately put there, but only after contemplating the nature of war for a decade and to show the what is lost and what it costs. 
---
The new models look like they're out of a disney movie. They don't look like real creatures at all.
---
But will that remain with Classic being on the new WoW Engine/code?
---
Knowing that the server won't randomly die off due to internal corruption or a Cease or Desist is a big plus for me. I'd love to play a server that I don't have to worry about everyone leaving to "flock to the better scripted server," is also a big one.
---
hansjc has the perfect answer. 
---
But to add to speculation wow expansions always came out in August/September. So it will probably be late summer.
---
You know shaman is really good vs casters right? I think you are trolling at this point and will not reply anymore.
---
Could not have said it better myself. Its as if they are delusional enough to think that the subtle nuances of patch change and itemization will bring them closer to their original experience (which is unobtainable) but completely disregard the fact that THEY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS to a puzzle that has been solved 10 years ago.
---
A compelling argument could be made that in an effort to preserve authenticity, changes SHOULD be made. We knew nothing in vanilla and figured it out as we went... By creating Classic with some new variables (different tuning, different itemization and different patch points etc) we are actually getting CLOSER to the original experience which was when we were entirely oblivious. Now im not calling for a rehaul of all items and boss encounters, but some subtle changes couldnt hurt IF they are in the spirit of increasing the challenge and promoting longevity to the final product.
---
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING?
---
Prep and planning is key if you want to go fast. Kill speed might be slow, but our rotation is so simple that we can end a fight with high HP / Mana so low downtime, just on to the next one. Grinding's good for us. Any quest that isn't supported by grinding, skip.
---
Hey master that and you get a raid slot.
---
You can get pretty far with just dungeons and BGs. x3 exalted with rank 10 armor is solid. It depends a little on the class aswell.
---
I would say your experience would be more fun going in blind. You get to experience what everyone is craving to have again, first hand.
---
Yet another one of these posts, the game is not even launched yet and people are worrying about OVER two years into the future.  How many of these people making the posts will even still be playing then, when they realize that clearing Naxx is probably going to be restricted to a handful of guilds per realm.
---
I have been playing vanilla wow now since beta, and while most people carried on with TBC and the rest of the expansions I was not.  I hit 70 and quit because the game was no longer what it should be.  I have spent the time in between then and now playing vanilla.  I have played every class to level cap, both factions, done as much pvp as I will EVER want to do and am I asking for an OSRS model or new content? NOPE.  I have done literally everything there is in the game except clear Naxx, and I refuse to do that until I can do it in classic.
---
Now you may ask why, well because I can.  I will do it all again with classic too, another set of characters all at max level.  Do I need MORE content to keep me interested? No.  Would I like more content to be added? No
---
This is a historical reproduction because the game is just THAT important in the history of gaming, alongside such great games such as Elite or EQ or even Mario.  
---
The ONLY time I would accept any form of deviation would be IF there is ALWAYS a 100% vanilla locked realm that anyone can tranfer onto if other realms get updates.
---
We fought for classic for a decade, LONG before Nostalrius and the petition.  We asked for vanilla, and now its actually being done a whole new bunch of people turn up and start asking for changes.
---
I can respect your wish for new stuff to do, just maybe consider that the game is NOT MEANT FOR YOU if that is what you want.  This is a heritage project, you would not go and adjust up the mona lisa just because you think it needs it.
---
My wife and I don't play wow. But I did get her to enjoy the fallout series and she loves the wii u
---
Priest and Warriors are always needed at all stages of the game!  Most times it's a group of 4 missing just a tank or 4 missing just a healer.  As long as the server population is decent then finding a group will be much faster than being a dps.  Just don't get the reputation of being bad.
---
Lol how dumb you are :) have you ever played duel against skilled warlock or mage
---
You literally don't know what are you talking about at this point. It is obvious that you have never played elemental shaman in high end PVP.
---
Petition for BC servers, or reroll a character.
---
Because it wasn't blizzlike or even how it was back in the day and they already said its gonna be as close to that as possible. 
---
I highly doubt they're going to release with un-linked AHs.
---
Are you trying to catch me with some big circular *if these items trivialize content, then they also trivialize difficulty.* Yeah, that's a HUGE component of progressive Itemization for a lot of people. Preserving difficulty. 
---
Titanic Leggings don't trivialize ranking for warriors, they devalue it. For some, they might even invalidate it. 
---
I like the progression curve of a world with progressive itemization, having personally played with it. 
---
A feral druid can actually tank bosses and can tank aoe packs like a god (maybe not quite as well as pala but still). And they can still do top tier dps without gimping their spec at all. 
---
Girlfriend doesn’t mind me playing, and sometimes even pretends to be interested and asks questions. It’s great.
---
Why do people think that clearing naxx is the end? Your going to have to run that shit loads of times until you get everything you want 
---
Keep playing Classic (full T3 / BiS, PvP, alts, new server) or continue with TBC. No new content developed by the current wow team please.
---
Servers with older versions is unrealistic, way too much work for Blizzard.
---
I mean I dont know if you’re mad but you insult others on reddit about a discussion on game.ok bye
---
Wow, you're a pretty fucked up person if any of this comment is true. 
---
I'm sorry for the bluntness, but that's a pretty fucking big load of bullshit, mate. 
---
I'm a priest leveling with no guild rn. I have gotten a bunch of random whispers from people asking if I want to run a dungeon. It's awesome just getting random invites to full dungeon groups without even trying.
---
BWL/AQ40/Naxx cause many problems for casual guilds. Seen this first hand on private servers.
---
&gt; instant
---
hah...
---
My girlfriend is pretty annoying when I want to play games. But she has shown me so much about what it's like to be in a healthy relationship. 
---
It's tough because on one hand I want to play to unwind and relax, but at the end of the day cuddling and just talking about nothing probably does the same thing.
---
But no matter what in the back of my mind I that myself "so when can I log on". 
---
It's fucking sad in a way. And infuriating in others. Some people will always look at gaming and assume it is mindless...and then ask me to download the first episode of Lindsay Logan's Beach club. Which we watched together. 
---
If you were wondering, Panos seems like a real OG.
---
WoW has always been cartoony, it was never meant to look realistic. How does the first picture looks like a real creature?
---
With the current state of retail the initial wave is going to be huge.
---
I started in 2006 when I was 16 i think people can handle it now.
---
It was said in the WoW panel at Blizzcon that there would be no linked AH.
---
Progression with your characters to TBC Classic is the obvious answer.
---
Blizzard has 2 options:
---
1) Develop new content at the expense of developers, artists, and testers that they arent sure will be a hit with their player base.
---
Or
---
2) Release TBC allowing people to progress their characters making then play and subscribe longer. TBC by the numbers was a more popular game than vanilla and requires magnitudes less work than creating a new custom patch.
---
The easiest solution is also the one that makes them the most money. 
---
spongebob was always cartoony but its much different looking now. lots of people dont like the way it looks compared to when it first came out 
---
China has that IRL if I hear correct.
---
I'm gonna be excited to step into MC alone. If I get to BWL in two or three years, I'll be happy. 
---
July 16th is more probable though, what with the usual Blizzard shenanigans regarding gnomes
---
I'm looking forward to being excited about selling things for 1.5 gold again.  Holy hell I hope they don't allow tokens on classic....  
---
Some of us actually have to plan for holidays about half a year in advance, coz public jobs...
---
Honestly the hype is dying and Blizzard is digging its own grave. I dont have high hopes for classic anymore.
---
Back in the day I leveled both ways without even knowing all the jazzy things you can do. 
---
As a casual at the time leveling different warriors I came to the conclusion fury gave fastish constant damage, and arms would give slow big numbers.
---
It all depended on what you like looking at. 
---
But now I'm all about being a master combatant, watch Conan the Barbarian movies, and kick on the heavy metal
---
PvP.  That is all that game will be played for 6 years down the road if they just keep it at Classic.
---
Kolkar is a clan, centaur is the race.
---
My wife plays both retail and pservers with me.
---
Definitely a keeper.
---
It'll be 9 years in 2 weeks!
---
Keep your head up, there's loads of good ones out there!!
---
Yep, Vanilla was already much worse than Blizzard's previous titles. But then of course thing kept getting progressively worse with new expansions.
---
Yeah, after this year I decided to get invested in a pserver community now before blizz starts shutting them all down for a bastardized version.
---
thats the dumbest thing I've ever heard. "get invested" prior to shutdown. 
---
Most servers/ faction will most likely have their own discords where there will be a place for this.
---
I think the whole thing about Caverns of Time is that the timeline is getting changed and your job is to stop it from changing.
---
A newer client was a guarantee from the beginning.  
---
Got all that down already, plus I'm duoing with my wife (warrior), so we can actually do alot of things solo players can't (or at least we can do them earlier).  Was hoping I could get some specific zone-order tips (or do you generally follow joannas path?) or specific quests to DEFINITELY skip or items to definitely save etc.
---
Why would they fear a big wave? It means do much money to them. 
---
What is wrong with it that it doesn't matter?
---
You can't just keep pointing to a statement without anything there to defend it.  I was discussing your points, but you say they're irrelevant.  What is so wrong with it?
---
*cries in Paladin*
---
Stop posting
---
Did you know that the vast majority of review write-ups on Amazon, both positive and negative, are fake? Amazon even notes which reviews are from verified purchasers and it doesn't solve the problem. If Amazon can't get valid review data for its products, why would this hypothetical website be able to do better for players? I'd never trust it.
---
You're overwhelmed by every guide saying something different so you want instead to be blasted by a random chorus of random advice? Wouldn't the least stressful thing be just to make a choice for yourself? 
---
I think this is pretty accurate. I started playing in early WotLK. I played in every expansion except MoP(I don't think I need to explain why) but I am more hyped for Classic than any other expansion because I miss the community WoW had in WotLK. I am so excited to have more control over the way my talents work. Even if it isn't the same game I played back then, it'll be like discovering the game again since I never played true Vanilla. Even my friends who have played with me over the years are willing to try it with me once it comes out because they only have to pay the subscription. Honestly, the Alpha/Beta can't come soon enough.
---
Paladins are quite handsy after all.
---
Staying on patch 1.12 forever sounds like a great idea, and in fact what I hope for.  I would also welcome TBC servers and WOTLK servers - as long as they were locked from ever getting expansions themselves.  If there were compartmentalized expansion servers, there should be a permanent and free character transfer option.  If you play classic for 5 years and want to go to TBC, then you could transfer your character to a TBC server that stays TBC in perpetuity.  
---
I love the idea of making a few classic characters and leveling/gearing them casually for years.  I never want to log in on them and find that an expansion has been released and now all of that leveling/gearing is now useless and I need to do it again.   I want to be able to unsub until my kids grow up and leave the house.  Then when I go to a retirement home I can log in as an old man and find my max level tauren warrior at the inn on Thunder Bluff, Just where I left him 30 years before.
---
It's funny highest dps is on the side with no salv
---
Yes when I play with friends it's fine. But in Vanilla, playing with strangers was a LOT of fun too. Not so much anymore.
---
Haha, ok you win the thread prize. Honestly, reading through all these comments, you’re totally right, haha. 
---
Wasnt that about horde and alliance having the same ah?
---
Like you still have to use bootybay for crossfaction auctioning
---
the most common quote by game devs right after a launch is "we underestimated how many players there would be".  every time.
---
&gt;Going with fewer people just meant it was all around harder.
---
yeah thats kinda the point
---
That is understandable, but i feel like it would be nice to be able to just instantly search up people so you would not have to wait for an answer about somebody.
---
genius move by acti-blizz.
---
destroy the current game so the playerbase starts new.  
---
14y of content without much manpower. 
---
From what I paid attention to, so far the water has the new texture, the lighting/haze isn't quite vanilla, and the vegetation is upgraded.(The grasses move with the player running through them and seems to be more than I remembered) 
---
Without the spell batching the combat appears smoother or quicker, it's hard to describe it. 
---
The demo didn't go high enough to see if they had the 'hd textures' on armor sets or anything like that. And I didn't pay attention to creeps like the rabbits, chickens, and the super low poly praire dogs. Lol
---
But if you asking about how many things have been upgraded in retail? Close to everything that can move had been 'upgraded' at some point to new models and other things like some skins were given a higher pixel count 
---
BWL gets pugged on private servers within 1 month of its release. Not to mention these servers are typically running a quicker release cycle, so players have LESS time to gear up through MC and its STILL getting pugged relatively quickly.
---
I wish, heirlooms got nerfed to shit so I have to slog through the shitty meaningless leveling process forever even with them in retail.
---
One easy solution to this could be that the reps and reviews are sent by you through the game, where it actually also shows your character that sent the review. That, and also it could have like a level requirement of 10 to be able for a review to even be able to show up on the site. What do you think? Would that make you more likely to believe it?
---
And then on current retail your character got weaker while lvling from 110 to 120.
---
You can do good dps with a 2h fury slam build, especially on fights with lots of adds.
---
Other than 2h fury, ehnancer, ret and as you said hunters will roll on 2h weapons.
---
&gt; Are you trying to catch me with some big circular *if these items trivialize content, then they also trivialize difficulty.* Yeah 
---
Boy you are smart... You caught me. If the object is to preserve difficulty, why not tune for difficulty which would be FAR more effective than dealing with itemization progression which really makes a VERY minuscule difference in the grand scheme of things. Minuscule in comparison to how MUCH you could affect difficulty with proper tuning.
---
You don't have to raid.  You won't be in full BIS gear, but neither will anyone else for years. You can get good enough items from dungeons, and from crafting.   When they release the PvP rewards, you'll be able to get some epics then if you rank high enough.  It's not the end of the world not to have your classes BIS raid set.  Many of the people you'll encounter in PvP aren't going to be raiding much either.  
---
Silly question, it was always given to the one and only true DPS for each faction. Retribution Paladin and Enhancement Shaman.
---
Joke aside, for strenght weapon we just looked at each warrior and usually the one that did the most PvP got it. 
---
It's an MMO, nothing is mandatory.  You could be one of those guys making PvP videos where you strip down to just your jimmies and a worn dagger and still go out and kick ass.
---
&gt; I love the idea of making a few classic characters and leveling/gearing them casually for years
---
aah like that twinks everyone was doing on the demo, but on live sever. Gear up and up until you reach the peak.
---
Makes sense too. But after a few years, the servers will be dead if they don't get updates. Maybe stick with 1.12 for a year or two, but not forever.
---
Most raids I was in were, are you going to use the item in the raid?  Those people have priority first then anyone else.
---
Why are shamans trash? Just generally curious. I hear they're really good healers end game.
---
I think your denying the fact that bfa made a lot of people quit atm ,so yes current wow is failing atm until the newer patches, may it be good.
---
Fucked up for being interested in manipulation of the psychology of women? Not so. You do it everyday. And so does everyone else ? 
---
I would be very surprised if there isn't an armory for classic.
---
though, it's too late to log in to THE SAME tauren warrior after 30 years. There was a character wipe, you see... at least on classic servers.
---
BTW, I would like to do that IRL......
---
Reality will set in for y'all.
---
Sigh you really do not get it do you?
---
Your woman if you have one, is more than likely sucking others dudes dicks or at the very least, fantasizing about it . It’s the state of women these days. I’m sorry you’re too much of a cuck to realize you’re being used and played until the next guy comes along that satisfies her more than you do. 
---
That is literally a 3-4 month period to give themselves breathing room since they don't actually HAVE a date yet
---
Sounds like you're in for a rough life lol
---
Yeah, maybe they should re-introduce lag and disconnects as well, and have that 4-6 downtime every wednesday as well for updates.
---
They should just learn from the Nost devs on how to do vanilla servers right.
---
Because it means Activision/blizz would have to shell out cash to have actual good servers instead of these shitty tiny weak cloud based cheap micro servers they cheap out on with phasing.
---
Thank you!
---
I love Siv haha
---
This website uses TBC data. item level was introduced in TBC. May be it was on server database, but this data wasn't exposed to client, even via Lua API.
---
Not me with how unpopular WoW is becoming lol 
---
If Classic was to fail because of Activison/Blizzard, would the team ever consider bringing Nost back?  
---
Did Blizzard make you sign any non-competes or anything for them bringing you into the "know" that would prevent you from restarting Nost?
---
In all seriousness though Classic is an objectively better game. 
---
I agree, go with the poe itemization. More diversity of builds and horizontal item progression.
---
If we dont speculate about 4 years in the future then how will i decide what class to roll for future seasonal theoretical lvl 60 karazan content?
---
It's these little things that make WoW such a great game
---
My point was that the majority of YouTube is like this, and for the record, more often than not people just screencap a video and cut it out for a thumbnail :-P
---
They have a 'Random Article' button that I use often. But some people like to plug in key words and then see what comes up. 
---
There it is. The "philosopher". LOL.
---
that comment doesn't make much sense, they would still make more money that way xD
---
Even outside of raiding, what if there was a way to upgrade to.5 to say dungeon set 3 that had some powerful generalist stats as opposed to the very powerful specific stats for classes?
---
Yes I agree it's pretty horrible. But WoW videos used to be the difference. But I understand the cash cow needs to be milked and it needs to be milked quick and as effortlessly as possible 
---
not sure what you mean by stacking bow skill.. you dont need to stack it.  In fact you shouldn't.  It has insane diminishing returns.  The first 5 points you get from bow skill will give you effectively 3% hit rating whereas the next 5 points above max will net you like less than 1% or something.  Can't remember the actual numbers but it falls off pretty drastically.  Also the only "decent" bow for hunters late game is Rhok'delar and it gets replaced in BWL.
---
What is this quality
---
I did and I can.
---
&gt;You also got to choose between Dragonblight and Grizzly Hills
---
is hardly "discussing your points".. 
---
I added a 2nd and now a 3rd
---
&gt;WotLK leveling doesn't belong in an RPG.
---
because it's something that ppl with brains will get and I'm not here to explain something to someone who won't get what I'm trying to say. It's like trying to communicate using a language the other party doesn't understand..
---
This really seems like a cool option. No need to add aditional rungs to the ladder, just widen the exsitisting ones. Why not add the emerald dream as a raid that has gear to help balance druids not be such a oom meme? I think it would be neat to see some unlocked potential in a lot of classes come out via new gear rather rebalance classes. It can both change the meta but not mess witb the already established talents and current gear.
---
That's an interesting question. I know that item level was not exposed via Lua API (like it's exposed now). But thottbot at that time displayed item level, so they got it somewhere. Probably it was available in game data.
---
So instead they don't want customers so they won't make any money? Doesn't make any sense. 
---
I would say Trolls are actually better rogues than Orcs in pve.  Bloodfury can often be something that kills you because of the reduction in healing. and rogues can't use axes.  The stun resist is nice but random.
---
Meanwhile retail players: "We should end the faction divide so that realm first mythic kills won't just all be Horde guilds."
---
They really don't care about the RP aspect of MMORPGs anymore... 
---
This isn’t how business works :P
---
*yday*
---
For me to believe a ninja looting claim the addon itself would need to be able to validate as part of logging the report that the two players were grouped together and the offending player won the specific item he's accused of ninjaing while they were grouped.
---
No player-entered text is of interest, only what the addon can glean from the chatlog and game state.
---
It would certainly suck if we have sharding but there are bigger issues like automatically getting banned because you were reported enough times..
---
It varies by guild and loot system.  If it's strictly a DKP type system (earn credits to spend on loot) then anyone who could use it COULD spend on it, or if it's master loot / council loot then they would have a separate list of who has priority on what gear and give that person first dibs.  Usually based on consistency of attendance, other loot recently received, contribution to the guild or other misc factors. 
---
You made the point the only "choice" was Borean or Fjord.  I pointed to another choice.  You just said it's irrelevant.  Pointing out factual errors in your post is not "irrelevant" just because you don't want to be fact-checked.
---
I can't read minds.  I don't know why you're saying it doesn't belong in an RPG.  I don't have your perspective on this.  It has nothing to do with my intelligence, but my lack of experience being you.
---
You make no good arguments.  Your arguments are "your fact-checking is irrelevant" and "I don't need to explain myself."  You're never going to convince anyone with that level of discourse.
---
&gt;I’m sorry I’m to real for society. My bad.
---
[Don't cut yourself on all that edge, bud](https://pics.me.me/0-unsheathes-katana-nothin-personell-kid-1746643.png)
---
Wonder how many more expansions need to come out until we get a randomly titanforged expansion with the RPG elements we want. 
---
I wouldn't sweat it to hard man. I promise you if you play a meme spec but are willing to go above and beyond with hear consumes etc. You will have NO problem finding a home.
---
Yes we will know way more information and cheese the system in basically all ways possible. But the memories and friends we are going to make will be most of the fun.  There is no getting that vanilla back from 05. But I do agree that the game could be made 10000% better with changes made in the spirit of vanilla. 
---
I'm going to wait a few weeks, see how it goes as far as what's different, etc. If it's all good I'll join a bit later. I'd love to be there for launch. 
---
I saw TBC launch and it was busy and crazy. I still smile thinking about how many folks were playing. You saw someone not in a group, you grouped up fast and got a full party ASAP. Then you all steamrolled the starting quests like a hit squad. It was fun. 
---
I know.  I'll be in the Nursing home, getting on the information highway, and begging the Nostralius group to "Bring Back Nost!" so that I can re-live those times, too!  :)
---
&gt;There's lots of people wanting a lot of different things
---
NO, there are people like me who want vanilla and there are people that don't want Vanilla. It's really simple really...
---
Blacklist might sproute on dutch discords based on how maintained it is that will have that function
---
That's why I was curious, because I don't think any class is using a 2h as their main damage unless they are a shaman or token ret pally
---
The guild your in or the group your raiding with with have their own rules. Could be a priority list, loot counsel, dkp bid or blind bid, Ms/os, or just a roll when prompted by the loot master. Hell I've even seen gold bidding. 
---
'Usually' the people your playing with know what you do and where the loot should go and there will be some kind of consensus.
---
After you get MC geared, you don't have to worry about mana if you use full consumables and bring stacks of mana pots and dark runes.
---
Paladin itemization is all about making Flash of Light stronger so that you don't have to use Healing Light.
---
Alts
---
This is exactly what I plan to do on my shaman. Gonna go 30/0/21 and not even bother switching specs to heal the raid. No way am I paying 100+g every week 
---
ninja.io
---
I thought the honor system was going to be in-place, but no PvP rewards until Stage 2? Or am I mistaken?
---
This is a good answer.  Rep rewards at revered/exalted are VERY nice if you're in end-game blues.  Don Julio band, TUF, etc are great power spikes if that's all you can do. 
---
Probably better to try and latch on to a casual raiding guild that's got some stuff on farm like MC/ZG/Ony and get some of those easier epics though.  Those instances are very doable and given the general knowledge of many players now, most guilds will probably get those pretty well established on farm status allowing for a not-too-crazy time commitment. 
---
That person has no clue what they're talking about.
---
Shamans are the best healers horde can get.
---
Early game especially, elemental shamans are one of the strongest PvP specs too.
---
I think that's just the retail sub bleeding over here, so there's a lot more spouting nonsense than there normally is.
---
For the cost of less than .50 a day.....
---
I'd upvote a thousand times if I could. Completely agree.
---
Hide in the water like this turtle? [https://youtu.be/8lKFNczM-wY?t=638](https://youtu.be/8lKFNczM-wY?t=638)

When I saw the title of this post... I figured... "Virgin WoW Player."
---
Was not disappointed.  /s
---
What does boob feel like good sir?
---
The good thing about hunters is that guilds don't bring many of them, so there's less competition for tier sets. If you want a decent weapon, you might want to raid BWL for [Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19361). As far as I'm aware, that crossbow is better than anything you can get before Naxx and BWL can be completed without being a hardcore raider.
---
Yeah man, the old Prairie dog looked way more realistic: [https://i.redd.it/hphoxdrr5ec01.png](https://i.redd.it/hphoxdrr5ec01.png) /s.
---
Lore pertinence and applicability rarely have ever driven decision making in WoW, especially in that early era.
---
I mean, you’re aware of the Draenai/Eredar retcon that happened at the start of TBC, right?
---
Blizz flexed the lore as needed to throw whatever cool stuff they wanted in the game. In the case of Atiesh I’d be surprised if they added it for any reason beyond “oh crap, we didn’t give casters a leggo.”
---
Putting it in Naxx (and sort of AQ) was done because they were the penultimate challenges in Vanilla. 
---
It’s somewhat hard to convert to someone that hasn’t extensively studied the development of WoW, how directionless and haphazard the overall process was. 
---
Trust me, go read John Staats book, you’ll realize that most of Vanilla was just a happy accident and stuff was kinda thrown in at random. 
---
Yeah this is in 1k needles pointing to Feralas and the horde sign pointing toward Freewind Post and the great lift?
---
"need a tipsout video quickly"
---
not gonna lie. That made me chuckle.
---
Without a swing timer you definitely won't be optimizing a 2h slam build. That being said, its not necessary for leveling.
---
I always preferred to level arms. Rend is a huge part of your damage output in the lower levels. Tactical mastery is great (though I never skilled anger management). Missing out on the cruelty feels kinda bad, but it is made up for with axe / sword spec. Mortal Strike at 40 is far better than bloodthirst or shield slam, so whatever you end up doing, I would make sure you have Mortal Strike at level 40, along with the whirlwind axe.  Only caveat is if you're human, there is an argument for the whirlwind mace (which obviously doesn't work well with axe spec, and mace spec is pretty useless PvE talent).
---
I think it was just time decay that took down the NE sign post.  They aren't a controlling presence in Feralas anymore and just have a small foothold of what's left in Dire Maul.  Hell, even DM is half filled with the ogres that took over the surrounding area.
---
Then after 6 months it will be a shallow pool.
---
Dont think I have heard of that one, I'll have to look it up
---
If WoW Classic becomes successful (and I really hope it will be), I just hope that when Blizzard works on their next-gen MMO they will take all lessons too heart, most important being:
---
\- An MMO should have a real community and the game should promote socialising - don't add new features for convenience if they destroy the social aspect of the game.
---
\- An MMO should have a single skill level for all players, but provide enough content for both casual as well as hardcore players.
---
With regards to the content in WoW Classic, I believe there's plenty. I played the game during Vanilla and I still had plenty of stuff to do by the time TBC was released. I guess one could call me a casual raider at the time, but I played the game \*a lot\*. I did many dungeons, probably did some dungeons every day. Farming my Wildheart set and later upgrading it to Feralheart must have taken months. I organised ZG pick-up groups, but none got so far as to complete ZG. I only set foot in MC, Onyxia and AQ20 maybe one time back then. And I am sure clearing this content with a casual guild will still take months. And I am sure AQ40 and Naxx will take much much longer for most casual guilds, if they will clear it at all. 
---
Oh, and from what I've read very little loot drops per boss that you'd have to share with 40 people in some raids, so it'll take a \_long\_ time to gear up for some raids.
---
And if they will provide the original AV, then there's always a fun BG to spend your weekends in. Not necessarily to win, but just to join an epic, multi-hour fight.
---
Just to show that Blizzard reads the p-servers shit talk -- I WISH sometimes that all of the bosses had new skills and fights.  I WISH there were new quests that are hard, hard, hard -- to get a blue that you need for 'raiding.'
---
I would love it if the "best guild on the server that can faceroll MC in two weeks" entered and ended up wiping on the trash...  Because Blizz saw them coming and decided to give them their money's worth.
---
Ditto with some of the quests -- even changing the location will screw up many folks.
---
Keep the flavor of the drink, just change the straw you use to taste.
---
All the "play how you want to play" stuff is just stupid pc nonsense . Sure if you're just leveling or something then do what you want but if you are part of a team who are working together to achieve something g then you can't expect people to be cool with you rolling a warrior with daggers because "that's what I like to play" then quite frankly you are playing the game wrong. You wouldn't play a game of football and only run backwards because that's what you feel like doing. 
---
That depends little lad.  Some are supple fresh and pleasant, others lumpily rest against your inner thigh, and some are so perfect they drive men to madness.  
---
I think classic will be pretty big at the beginning, but its slowly going to decay to a smaller state with a very loyal fanbase that mainly plays it because of nostalgia. 
---
If /sit doesn't work then Arms is the official winner, yes.   
---
Rend is worth using early on but eventually you will find you don't have the rage for it once you have other abilities like Sweeping Strikes, Mortal Strike, Whirlwind.    
---
You don't need Piercing Howl but its so dam good its hard to let it go once you have used it. Cruelty is dam good.
---
But all that isn't going to save you from hamstring kiting. If you want you can carefully pull mobs one at a time and stand there hitting them because you're just that lazy. But, it will be so much slower. You will take so much more damage and have to eat every two mobs. You'll also be more limited in the mobs you can kill because they will have to be green level for you.  And you will still randomly miss 4 times in a row and fall over and die because you don't kite. You'll spend more time not fighting and more money on food. Overall, its just straight up worse. You also don't get the benefit of moving towards the next mob while you pull. Many questing zones will be heavily contested and mages will be blowing through tagging every mob they can while you sit there standing and tanking one mob at a time. You will realize you want to move while you fight.
---
Honestly if you are too dam lazy to hamstring kite, you are probably too dam lazy to play a warrior. And perhaps too dam lazy to play vanilla.
---
Something "Player notes"
---
Use it to write down the "not ready for vanilla-prime-time players" that wipe your group.
---
Blizzard could change the whole stats on items and do a new changes with content progression. This would be great and gives a REAL feel of vanilla and not like its on pserverS where everybody know what to expect in future.
---
Nah, for trash packs with large amount of mobs (things like imps in mc, technicians in bwl) paladin are way better. 
---
&gt;Like when do you actually want a prot pala tanking? 
---
Aoe pull and maybe offtank some adds. 
---
&gt;Sure a pala might do that one part better but it is completely unnecessary and a waste of a raid slot most of the time
---
It's not a waste of a raid slot if he is a hybrid prot holy, which mean he will heal 90% of time as good as other paladin (the only thing you lose with a 30/21 spec is holy shock and it's not that good for healing, the benediction of sanctuary you get will be more valuable for every tank), and make some trash pack easier. He can also be a back up offtank for when you don't have enough.
---
If it's a paladin that want to be full prot then yes it's a meme spec.
---
\&gt;And can you demonstrate please how paladins can reach def cap "almost as easily" as warriors? Maybe if you sacrifice all other stats for defense....
---
Pre-raid bis tank gear for pala and warrior is almost the same and give def cap so yeah it's almost as easy.
---
Because they will have to make a huge investment for better/stronger/more hardware for a potentially very short-term influx of players. Which could end up not being a very cost-efficient solution. One the other end, they could choose not to upgrade their hardware and deal with what they got, potentially ruining their name even further by offering a poor experience.
---
Ouch. I have a public job in the school system, but even I don't have such an extreme issue putting in for vacation time.
---
Now I feel bad for those who do. Sorry, that was not my intent on such a statement.
---
In average the player will be better. Demographics 101. However the top players back then vs now?  Same. Vanilla wasnt a hard game to figure out.  Even back then. 
---
Dual Wield with no hit gear will be strictly worse than 2 hand unless you have a terrible weapon, which you shouldn't ever.
---
Very true I appreciate others are also happy with that mindset, sometimes I actually get envious of them.  But overall I don't have any regrets, even my WoW years (god I loved playing a full AV for the first time). I guess that's the great thing about MMOs you have all sorts of people with different mindsets to kill bosses with :)
---
The Classic WoW announcement ist still the most upvoted post of all time in /r/wow. I mean it's gonna be massive on launch.
---
tbh I also want that because at this point it really doesn't matter anymore, retail can't get any worse anyway so atleast give those last 7 remaining players what they want
---
I remember seeing all these shipwrecks in the old Thousand Needles’ Shimmering Flats, and always being curious about them. 
---
Those discords\*\*\*\* not dutch ones perse :p
---
Ahhhh yes Mindtap Talisman!!!!  
---
My guild helped me farm up 2 of those on my Shaman back then.  This time around, I hope they help my Paladin get two :)
---
The game isn't hard, it just takes a long time to get max level. But Classic doesn't punish you the same way Retail does for not being max level. So I don't really think people will quit, you'll just see the same people linger in that 40-59 bracket for extended periods of time. This was always the case, and even I did this. There is lots to do sub-60 that is fun and worth while.
---
I think I found the part he's referring to.
---
&gt; Many decisions we made were fairly clear cut. Things like Dungeon Finder were clearly a “no.” So were things like cross-realm grouping, the achievement system, unified auction houses, and flying.
---
It's ambiguous, but guess is that they mean no cross faction AH.
---
Never try to argue logic in these cases. Even when you're right you're wrong. 
---
I'm probably much older (mid 20s) and my gf (late 20s) doesn't care at all.  My desk is next to my bed so she can lay on there and watch movies while I play games and we can talk without issue to each other.  Often times I cast a movie from a chrome tab to the TV so we can watch the same movie.  I watch on my 2nd monitor and she watches on the TV.  The sound comes from the TV.
---
If you're not shirking responsibilities and just play during free time I don't think it'd be a big deal.  If you're younger and spend a LOT less time with your GF then yeah, maybe just hang out with her instead of playing games.  If you don't have anything to do together other than watch TV you probably don't actually have anything in common and should just break up.
---
Sorry but this is very wrong, especially on a pvp server. If you didn't use /sit, then you were not playing optimally or leveling as fast as you could. So why should anyone listen to you?
---
You could probably run it on one of those smart toasters so your options are pretty wide open.
---
I would like to see them expand horizontally instead of vertically, when the time comes. To be clear, I'm talking about 3-4 years or even longer down the road. And this is also in the context of "if the game is being expanded, this is what I would do," not "they should definitely expand the game."
---
No increased level cap, no raids on the absolute highest end (at least not exclusively). Expand things in the middle of the game. For example, a new 30-40 leveling zone, some new level 60 blue dungeons, a new entry/mid level raid (IMO they don't even need to start from scratch, Karazhan as a 20-man, level 60 raid, similar difficulty to ZG would be great), new class quest lines, etc.
---
Classic will run very well on any modern PC. I've conducted a lot of benchmarks comparing Vanilla, Classic, and BFA, and Classic runs very well, better than Vanilla strangely enough.

Something like this would work great, IMO. That includes the cost of Windows, so you're really looking at around $400 for a bare-minimum for hardware only. You could bump up to 16 GB of RAM to be a bit more "future proof" and later on slot in a dedicated GPU if you so desired. These are rough/place-holder parts, you can find different PSUs/cases/etc as needed depending on your preferences and budget.
---
Why would anyone need to be hyped half a year before the game is out? Just relax and do something else until they're ready to release more information. 
---
I’m a huge fan of adding in horizontal item progression for the “off-specs”. Or even like post Naxxramas Class Quests, similar to Rhok’Delar. Maybe a shield for Paladins that give them the ability to actually tank? I’m not sure what you’d need to do, I’ve got some truly terrible ideas but I’m not the one to make such suggestions.
---
Kid, not everyone is a retard who plays the Game like a fucking race! 
---
Did you not play Diablo 3 at launch?
---
This doesn't sounds like a good idea at all. You can never count on people to be mature and not list whoever pissed them off on any random day. 
---
If someone does something awful enough they'll become infamous on their server, but we don't need to persecute them. How many people hit need on everything the first time they started playing because they didn't get the need/greed system? 
---
1.12 itemizaton/debuff slots / talents feels like 2006 world of warcraft, which is what they are trying to re-create as per their panel at blizzcon.
---
Awesome!   Thanks for the detailed response  :)
---
Because he is being anal and selfish
---
I've never really liked the direction they've taken WoW w/ the retcons and various things they've "added" to the story, how they've developed characters and etc., so this post is actually quite exciting for me. That said, here's how I would've done things a bit differently, each bullet is to be an "expansion" of sorts (in order of how the story would evolve), with the over arching story as the main bullet and the "sub story archs" and various other details as sub bullets. 
---
* Go to Northrend, defeat Arthas, the armor is destoryed, no more lich king, no new scourge created, all that's left is existing ones
---
 * no new races for the first expansion
---
 * Old God presence is minimal
---
 * no flying
---
 * no Dalaran 
---
*  Illidan reaches out to faction leaders (after Arthas' death) asking for help in a plot against kil'jaeden, plot is found out by burning legion, we are pushed back to the gate, we must close the gate via Karazhan
---
 * Dalaran opens as neutral city
---
 * New races become available, same as in retail w/ Blood Elves for Horde (due to Sylvanas, I always thought that made sense) but instead of space goats the Alliance gets the Broken per WCIII, as Illidan favors the Alliance via his brother, Malfurion, who as woken up
---
* The magic used to close the gate (via Karazhan) awakens Deathwing
---
 * the shattering doesn't happen
---
 * Deathwing's actions cause the other dragons to become more present in the world (dragons would have factions you can gain rep w/, along w/ raids that go w/ them, caverns of time open [ this will also open a portal to "old outland", the one we lost access to when we lost it to the burning legion in the previous patch so that the old content can still be experienced], etc.), but weaker as we have to kill Deathwing
---
* Dragons weakening causes old gods to rise up and reach out through time portals via Caverns of time and emerald dream and various other locations around Azeroth (Uldum, Bael Modan, etc.)
---
 * old gods facing defeat, use last of their might to reopen portal to outland
---
 * IIRC, in the War of the Ancients novels, the Old Gods had a major influence in the shenanigans that went on because they wanted to bring the burning legion so that they could basically be set free by Sargaras, this is my logic behind them re-opening the portal, they wanted to buy time and regroup
---
* portal to Outland opens, fight legion, retake outland
---
 * The legions presence, since retaking outland entirely after our last visit, has diminished because there were no more foes for them to fight, thus much of the legion has moved on, this allows us to retake Outland and beat the remaining legion presence there
---
 * While fighting in Outland, the burning legion slip through the Portal and contact naga in the malestrom so they may make a new well of eternity
---
* New well of eternity is established, kil'jaden is summoned 
---
 * broken isles are opened
---
* kil'jaden is killed, but uses last of his might to push energy (from well of eternity) to reform Sargeras 
---
 * well of eternity breaking again, and the new threat of Sargeras causes dragons to reach out to titans 
---
 * While Azeroth has faced many a threats before, nothing really compares to Sargeras (save a fully powered set of Old Gods maybe), this is why the Dragons have never reached out to the Titans before now
---
* titans come to azeroth, all beings fight sargeras and the Burning Legion
---
 * all fighting allows Old Gods to gain strength again 
---
* fight the full fledged Old Gods with titans, finally defeated
---
 * titans leave mortals once again to their old devices
---
* left to fight amongst ourselves
---
Now that the story is wrapped up in a nice little bow (IMO, anyway), I think now it would be cool to introduce some of the other races that you could hire as heroes in WCIII(Pandarian, Orges, etc.), have them act similar to the Pandarian in the sense that, you can chose what faction to be part of, but all content after that should be PvP oriented. 
---
If only we hadn’t killed Whitemane and Mograin I’m Cathedral, would have been a cool double boss fight.
---
Auction houses will be linked by faction.
---
Sw,IF,DARN
---
ORG,UC,TB
---
Heh.
---
5% crit &gt; Sweeping Strikes + Axe Spec (5% Crit)????
---
interesting logic.
---
Yes, but it gets pugged by good players and usually alts from hardcore guilds, so people know what they are doing. Obviously a casual guild will also clear BWL eventually, but it wont happen for multiple weeks.
---
Dumped many girls for wow expansions.
---
Now I'm married and my wife doesn't care what I do during my hobby time.
---
I don’t find this to be reliable or beneficial.  I feel it would just hurt most normal player’s rep in a way akin to gearscore.
---
And I’ll refuse to deal with GS again.  Too many ways to punish good players even if it could be used to flag the bad ones.
---
Solution: stop using questie. You'll read the instructions whether they scroll by quickly or not. 
---
Personally I always have instant quest text on because of those sea monster quests in darkshore. There's always some murloc waiting to sneak up behind you if you aren't quick enough. 
---
Do you know what Orc's racial is lol?
---
He asked what the best leveling spec is, not for some shitty opinion of someone who doesn't even acknowledge Anger Management or Impale.
---
&gt;If you want to get to 40 as easy as possible 2H Fury is clearly the better Choice.
---
You were wrong. Now you are just calling me a retard for what? Being right?
---
I got my mouse just to play certain classes.  It has a free scrolling scroll wheel where I can just spin it and it'll freely scroll without clicks.  Just bind frostbolt to mouse down and spin it.  You don't have to do anything for around a minute if you spin hard enough.
---
No. Pre-raid bis tank gear does not give def cap after the defense nerfs. Which is most likely what the items will be in Classic.  And if you are wearing that gear, your mana will be trash.
---
It's not just itemization.  It's the talents also and threat/tanking changes.
---
Put it all together and you get one huge EZ mode.  
---
If you change threat to pre 1.11 levels, it would at least keep DPS in check.
---
Wasting even ONCE CENT on a single extra micro bit of server to provide a smooth gameplay experience for customers is a fire-able offense in the game-making industry.
---
You are under the misguided assumption that you are similar to normal people. So lets get it out of the way right now, something is WRONG with you. You are in some way broken inside to think about life and other people the way you do. Normal people are NOT interested in studying women to manipulate them, and there is a reason that people like you are relegated to fringe internet communities. That reason is that you don't belong in civil society. You don't have to hide what you are from the real world (in person) because you're misunderstood or "to real for society". It is because we understand what you are and are disgusted by you. See a therapist and get help. I promise that life can be better than what you're going through if you work to fix it. Please get help.
---
In my personal non-min/maxing opinion, vanilla is much more fun to play casually than the current game is. I'd even say that's what it's geared towards. All the small, everyday things you do feel challenging and meaningful whereas the current game has all the interesting content loaded at the end. 
---
Even on private servers you constantly run into new players, or old players who have forgotten how to play the game, and no one expects you to be hardcore unless you join a hardcore guild. 
---
Yes, excellent comment from /u/soupsoka
---
I was in a similar boat a couple years ago just looking for a reasonably priced pre-built PC since my old one was woefully out of date especially in RAM/processor speed. 
---
WoW will run fine without a dedicated GPU especially if you're OK running on low/medium settings.  The things you want to watch for are making sure you don't get an older or out of date motherboard.  As long as your motherboard is relatively current you can easily get updated processor (1 hour to replace a processor with perhaps $10 worth of supplies to do it), ram sticks, or hard drive.  DEFINITELY recommend the SSD + regular hard drive as it helps a great deal.  
---
You should be able to get a nice modern PC that runs WoW no problem for less than $500 all told.  Amazon/etc will sell prebuilt PCs with similar specs if you aren't the DIY type (this is what I did) and they have limited warranties for most in case something goes wonky in transit. 
---
Indeed. I plan to play Classic while wearing layered polo shirts, listening to John Mayer, and wondering what's going to happen this week in Lost so that I don't pollute the experience with my 2019 judgement.
---
Difference is you get cruelty maxed out at lvl 15 compared to everything you just mentioned at lvl 30+.
---
and sweeping strikes ain't that good, takes 30 rage just to use and then you're taking double damage, much better to just fight 1 at a time 
---
No you can get your av weapon/rings and 5m gear and stand on similar or higher footing than a lot of people
---
I'd be interested in what benchmarks you've used, i've been stalling a laptop for the other half because i'm uncertain what will run classic well enough. I'm also aware my own consideration of what is well enough if very different from her, I tend to go overkill on my builds and laptops.

Error 37
---
Login Successful!   
---
..JK Error 37 Error 37 Error 37 Error 37
---
This is an incredible assessment. 
---
They have a cellphone farm where they are testing Diablo, I am sure those phones can be repurposed as servers.
---
That wasn’t 1.2, evisc got updated shortly after
---
The influx of users would only be for about a month compare that to the months of setup and the months they have to pay for the servers even when their not needed.
---
Our whole guild, or most of them, will be trying out Classic together. I suspect that the majority of us will stay on the classic server if it's truly Vanilla.
---
[deleted]
---
In my experience people are *a lot* more forgiving and understanding on private servers than they are in the current game. The dungeons are harder which means people accept that accidents and wipes happen now and then. When they do the group works through it. 
---
The attitude people have going in is different as well; on retail they're looking for a quick run so they can queue up to the next dungeon; in vanilla people have put a lot of effort and time into the run before you even step into the instance. You'll be treated as a human being rather than a mute, faceless blob of pixels.
---
I'd be down for new classic-wise content, like classic Kara, Dragon Isles, or classic Emerald Dream.
---
At a high level?  Mana was always an issue - but especially if you progression raided.  MC itemization while bad, wasn't as terrible as people think.  Mainly because since spell power was practically non existent, you needed all that +int for mana.  Yeah, we had gems and pots and evocation.  But that wasn't always enough.
---
Compare that to now.  If private servers are any indication (and that's a big if), you have mages in greens going arcane power.  Pew Pew dead.
---
No resource management needed.  It seems like Classic will also go down that route.
---
I would gladly pay $15 a month for classic wow if it's near exactly the same content that we find on [Insert your favorite server] with bug fixes.
---
You should add multiple people drowning in that wave... then replace each of their faces with logos of all MMOs of the current market.
---
This little thread is exactly why I am glad to pay for Classic.
---
You said it was better than two tiers of Arms talents. Demonstrably false. Now you are making a completely different argument, which is true yes. 
---
 You can easily take cruelty and still go arms. 
---

---
I believe that the orcish axe in the side is meant to lead us to the conclusion that the sign was "retired" by horde troopers.
---
Exactly. Anything like this is usually pretty easy to script/spoof. 
---
That's incredibly lore unfriendly unless the Kolkar clan joined the alliance, which would be absurd.
---
“Something we want to avoid” != will avoid.
---
As a lawyer I really enjoy Ion’s use of words. 
---
What the fuck am I reading?
---
Whatever was in place at 1.12. It may not be the best system but if you have AV at 1.7, then people would want rogue at 1.5, UBRS at 1.1, etc.
---
Less is more.
---
I can’t tell if you’re being serious.
---
&gt; Yes, but it gets pugged by good players 
---
As someone who runs these pugs, we start with a core 10 players and bring anyone with appropriate gear. You dont need to be good. Infact most people who are attracted to pugs dont have a raid spot of their own and often arent very good at all. The encounters have 1-2 mechanics and everyone uses addons for those. The content is trivial.
---
&gt; a casual guild will also clear BWL eventually, but it wont happen for multiple weeks. 
---
Casual guilds that maintain a 2 day raid schedule per week have no issues clearing BWL within a month / month and a half. Keep in mind that because of the quicker content release cycle, guilds have less than HALF of the normal time to gear up in MC. So you can only imagine how much easier BWL would be if you had an extra few months to gear your guild up in MC. Yet casuals are still tearing through with no resistance.
---
Over the years, video games have gone from something that defined me (and my free time) to something that just allow me to relax.
---
* Sports/fitness are good, you still need 2-3 rest days a week (especially when you’re pushing 30)
---
* Work is good, but you can burn yourself out if you work too much
---
* School, but it can burn you out in the same way work can (especially if you’re doing both)
---
Sometimes it’s just relaxing to grind out some mobs with a beer and LotR on the other monitor.
---
Haha good thing I havn't had a girlfriend or really anyone close to me in a relationship since I was 16. Right, guys :')?

You're welcome! Please feel free to DM me if you have any extra questions down the road; you can also ask here again or on r/buildapc or r/buildapcforme if you decide that building a PC is ideal for you. As u/hippoofdoom mentioned, there are good prebuilts in this price-range, too.
---
How long exactly are your fingers?
---
WotLK was amazing... But vanilla was the real. I recommend a private server to prepare yourself. The difference is serious and usually catches people off guard.
---
Welcome
---
I am completely serious. 
---
If you think about it, it can be looked at as insulting towards the current devs as classic goes against a lot of what they feel is good design.
---
I know levelling was slower but it was also way slower it WotLK. I've played on a private wrath server to reexperience that nostalgia and the last 10 levels took waaaay longer than I expected. But what are some of the major differences? 
---
GOD I HOPE THIS IS TRUE. After Wrath of the Lich King all the lore gets dumped out. PLEASE make this happen.
---
I don't care what version they put in, it will be awful either way. Both sides will just do whatever they can to avoid each other, while whichever side loses more often will tell at each other to "let them win" so the raiders there can more quickly get their Don Julio rings. 
---
I was going to say add a bunch of Youtubers drowning while shouting "evacuating isn't Classiiiiicc!"
---
Historical recreation means making changes to counteract problems that are resultant of emergent behavior on private servers in the last decade.
---
And then add some people on the rooftop saying “WHY DONT YOU GUYS PLAY BLACK DESERT ITS BETTER”
---
Isn't that for Warcraft 3?
---
I have a few videos on YouTube about some of the final results, but I ran some extra internal stuff a few months ago when the Classic Demo was live. I have a really high-end PC, but what I basically found was that my minimum frame times and average FPS were consistently better in the Classic Demo than they were in any tests in identical locations on a Vanilla client. Generally, my average framerate was pretty similar, BUT, my 0.1% and 1% low frametimes were always better in the Classic client than in Vanilla. My theory is that a lot of the improvements to the code over the years have seriously improved performance of WoW, but then if you strip away all the extra fancy effects that are in Legion/BFA to the more minimal effects in the Classic client, you basically end up with a super well-tuned Vanilla game that has some optional graphic improvements that are still less demanding on a PC than graphics you'd find in BFA.
---
Sorry, that's a jumble of words. Hope it makes sense. The main caveat in my experiments is that I used a very high-end system, so all I could really say is that the Classic client runs better than the Vanilla client... and since the Vanilla client has *extremely* low system specs by today's standards, I've made the educated guess that a very low-end-but-modern system will be absolutely awesome for Classic.

So in that last picture i wonder where the best place to be is, in an attempt to stay alive. 
---
yeah and no fear of unwanted pregnancy all the time!
---
Getting killed by a random bear the same level as you.... That was my experience first time back.
---
Leveling is even slower. Much slower. Classes have less diversity and thus seem more OP/UP in situations, but also way more fun. Certain class means a lot more! Group Dynamics are everything.
---
Shit is hard. It's near impossible to solo for anything other than regular quests most of the time. Be ready to make friends and ask for help. That's the best part.
---
You feel small and weak (and you are), but that makes the world more fun. Be prepared to die and work together more.
---
On one hand, I want y'all to be able to enjoy the beta.
---
On the other hand, if I abuse my moderator powers to ban this post and all similar posts, there's a better chance that fewer people will opt-in to the beta and therefore a better chance that Blizzard will choose me for the beta... /s
---
That's a statement that's been echoed for a while, and why people thought classic was never made earlier.  It seems now that blizzard had either truly realized it's financial value or retail is donezo.
---
Lorewise it might be cool to see a "future" setting where the war is over. 
---
But that's only because they already ruined the lore.
---
I remember rolling a priest in Wrath and getting killed by everything. Ugh being a cloth wearer was the worst. But thanks for all the tips! 
---
I'm confused though, I thought back then classes were MORE diverse not less.
---
Very interesting stuff thanks for this. It may mean I can significantly reduce the spec, i was planning on something a little leas powerful than my rig but she wants small and light. 
---
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/97i3zw/patchwerk_wednesday_alterac_valley/) a post I made a while back about all the changes AV has went through over the years, if anyone wants a guide to help the decide. 
---
The answer to your question is also in the post, it's a bit of a mix of all the patches, the purpose was to keep the epic feeling the original AV had while also trying to not allow games to last literally days. 
---
Realistically speaking, though, we'll probably get 1.12, seeing how that's the data that they have, but if Classic is a success, and I think it will be, I hope they go back and examine these sorts of things and polish them. 
---
We'll see, though. 
---
Years old and still one of my favorite formats. Makes basically anything 10x more humorous. 
---
Did that 2 weeks ago :) But thanks for the reminder.
---
Gonna laugh if servers crash from too many ppl
---
You're right. I misspoke. Much more diverse!
---
And the post under it has about 10k less upvotes, so its the most upvoted by a pretty chunky margin 
---
My best advice is to wait for official spec requirements from Blizzard, but ultimately, I'd be very surprised if a modern, low-end, desktop PC can't run it extremely smoothly. I'm not as familiar with laptop and can't give advice for those, but any low-to-mid-tier modern gaming laptop I have to believe can run it extremely well, too.
---
Instance not dungeon.
---
I've been watching videos by YouTuber Kargoz to prepare. Lots of videos about preparing for classic if you are interested.
---
But it doesn't feel like vanilla MC/BWL. Unless you mean as a catch up mechanic for bad guilds who couldn't manage mc until 1.12?
---
Going from the bottom image up...  
---
"What r/wowclassic thinks it's going to be."  
---
"What they fear it might be"  
---
"Reality 2 months after launch"  
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see Classic be a massive success, but I don't think it's going to be the runaway blockbuster some people think it'll be.  Yes, we'll likely see a shitton of people at launch but it's very quickly going to taper out to what will be a small, but likely tight-knit community.  (Small relatively-speaking, of course).  
---
I would welcome being proven wrong, of course.
---
Hey now, I’ve leveled various Paladins on p-servers. I wear my leveling laziness badge with pride!
---
I mean I've never been a big fan of the faction divide. I get the logic behind it, but it's always been hard to balance out racials and it naturally divides your playerbase with almost zero interaction. And I get that that was the point, I've just never been a big fan of being pushed into that role. The freedom of deciding your character's interactions is also an RP element. 
---
The biggest problem however has always been story related, and I'm not even talking about the artificial nature of the Horde co-operation. Blizzard constantly has to maintain that enmity between the two factions, even when in several occasions throughout the world's history they've had to work together. Hell it was basically the entire premise of Warcraft III, where the races of Azeroth put aside their differences to face a bigger threat. So every time those two factions come closer to one another, Blizzard has to invent some reason to artificially flare up that enmity again by putting warmongers in charge. Because that is what it built its entire identity around. But not one faction can be seen as the bad guys, and not one faction can actually come out with an advantage, because it can't appear that Blizzard favours one over the other. 
---
It leaves no room for story progression and permanently stagnates the faction balance despite the illogical nature of that stagnation. I mean Azeroth has seen war after war after war, and yet just two years after a devestating civil war that the Horde would've taken decades to recover from if at all, Sylvanas somehow manages to wage all-out war against the Alliance. And we all know that at the end of this expansion, there's going to be some world ending threat that means the factions will have to put down their differences again, making the entire premise of the faction war a pointless repeat of the MoP arc. Sylvanas and her Forsaken turning batshit evil is perfectly in line with their character, but the story should acknowledge this by ultimately changing that world order, just like it did at the end of Warcraft III. Leaving things as they are just because players don't like change goes against the very core of the "RP aspect" of RPG's.
---
Enjoy it while it lasts haha
---
TL;DR - Playerbase should make the post-endgame fun and not rely on blizzard.  Just an idea.
---
I think that, in addition to rerolling, the playerbase should sort of step in to get creative.
---
Most pservers close quickly, from what I’ve read, and don’t get too far before something new and shiny comes along.
---
The prospect of player implemented challenge tracking and server events would one thing that could be done.  Like raid clearing leaderboards, player/guild-made “holidays”, raffles, tournaments, bounties, and so on.
---
Challenges to beat a raid where everyone goes offspec.  Make a server national holiday or something. (A bit redundant from what I said before)
---
I believe that community driven innovations will be the way to go “post Naxx” so that people can constantly stay engaged socially and never have to alter the game.
---
These things would have to develop naturally and who knows if it would even be possible.
---
Again, just spitballing.
---
I think fracturing an already dwindling player base could be extreamly detrimental to present and future retail versions of WoW, what they think will happen is people who play private servers or people who quit from all the QOL changes will come back but will be curious enough to give retail a try which would boost retails populations. My reasoning behind this is simply the Classic is included in the Retail subscription and to a very minuet degree this may happen, no matter what as you said this is just more money either way.                    
---
                  
---
What I think is going to happen is for every 1 return player who tries retail and decides to play it you'll get 50 retail player deciding Classic is a way more fun experience and to stick with it solo, you have to remember Classic was a enormous time sink, no way anyone can actively play both in a healthy manner, people will have to choose and as OP's meme suggests most will choose the more rewarding gameplay experience.              
---
             
---
Now this is still good for Blizzard, until that is the release of their next expansion which no matter how good will still be compared to Classic and with BFA fresh on everyones mind those sales numbers I think will be where the large wave fear comes in. With Classic people now have a very good alternative to WoW, it's WoW!             
---
               
---
Even in 3-4 more years people will still be striving to clear all the raids and unless Blizzard has some powerhouse expansion planned that treats players with a modicum of respect I think Classic WoW could be the WoW killer every ones been expecting for years. Retail is already bleeding out and Classic can temporary staunch that flow but I think the far reaching ramifications could be worse. even if only 25% of the people who try Classic stay, thats still a large amount of more lost populations on retail.
---
We really need to start a r/classicwow playlist
---
This jaina thing is getting out of hand. Five, fifteen every day.
---
I wouldn't blame you. You could also just put it in the FAQ and remove posts based on the fact it's in the FAQ.
---
Oh awesome. I'll check that out after I get off work. 
---
They use an internal cloud model.
---
They’ll just use the excess capacity vacated by Overwatch and HoTS if it becomes a huge wave.
---
They’re not worried in the slightest. 
---
Blizzard for the last decade has annoyed players with their "we know better than you" attitude that keeps rearing its ugly head. I'd bet a lot of money on their pride was at least a contributing factor.
---
It's for WoW Classic. Currently says this on the site: 
---
"There is currently no public Beta version of WoW Classic. For a chance at being selected if a Beta becomes available, make sure Warcraft is checked on the Beta Profile settings in Blizzard account management.
---
If you are selected to participate in a Beta test, you'll receive an email with information on how to install the client and provide feedback."
---
That's my problem with memes in general.  The first one, maybe even two are sometimes clever and can get a chuckle.  But this copy paste shit with people who just aren't funny to begin with trying their hand at it makes me sigh.
---
I guess I'd like to know if it's bad etiquette to roll for it still
---
Was instant in TBC. In Vanilla it's .5 seconds. Still good when facing mages and escaping a shatter combo in a nova. 
---
Which is also probably a more of a major issue for them than most people probably realize: If they Overestimate how big or strong the initial wave will be, they’ll likely have a few empty servers after a month or two. Underestimate it and they’ll lose out on a lot of potential revenue while also having it labeled a debacle and more evidence Blizz has lost their way.  
---
Which is why I am kinda hoping they’ll release a large BfA patch around the same time Classic launches tbh. That should relieve some of the potential launch pressure by giving some of the tourists from current WoW something to do for a month or two before trying Classic.
---
Tell that to nostalrius, rip
---
i thought you all wanted no changes?
---
It’s not instant in classic which makes it kinda meh but it’s still a halfway decent racial. I believe the cast time is something like .5 seconds. I’m not sure about the window you were talking about though by starting the cast early. 
---
Whichever version lets me get exalted the fastest so I don't ever have to go back 
---
Did you try it before?
---
I did with honestly lvl 60 pre raid bis level gear.
---
Its the only time ill recommend it. If you can get 4+% hit, krol blade/axe of the deep wood combine with trash blade. 
---
Ofc 2hand is a solid choice, especially on pvp servers
---
I apologize for making the narrow minded assumption in my first post.  That was definitely not okay—because yes, financial situation and country are certainly factors.
---
I do think that $15 for entertainment over a month can certainly go a long way though!  Can’t tell ya how many times a WoW sub has kept me from going out and spending even more money on less!
---
talent, then assume if you have your way just get other reflect items (not thorns related)
---
if you are going for some kind of have the enemy kill themselves kind of thing... best find a pally buddy and buff him they have some good kit items for aoe / damage reflect
---
Playing horde, so hopefully the version with the wall jump to Stormpike Aid....aka....won’t be in Blizzard classic bc they’re fixing stuff like that :(
---
The game isn’t even out yet. 
---
Absolutely
---
Here's the test. Was it in vanilla?
---
AV with no reinforcement counter and no mines.
---
It feels like vanilla MC/BWL in late 2006
---
Yep I'm theorycrafting the maximum damage return for prot pala / resto druid pair.  
---
Prot pal already has almost 100 damage per hit through various items (gnomer helm, ret aura, rag trinket, etc) , about 250 per blocked hit (shield spike, blessing of sanc, holy shield if it's up) , then adding in thorns + hots + hurricane + paladin consecrate it gets pretty ridiculous.   
---
The only thing I could add beyond that would be a warlock for imp's fire shield + rain of fire and you've got a 3 man group that can probably do any 5 man easily, albeit slowly.  Boss fights would stink too and might have problems doing enough damage to outlast based on how long the fight would take and potential mana problems for the healer. 
---
I mean people can want for whatever, but developers should stand their ground and make choices based on what will be best for the game. Though I do think it's likely will get a 1.12 AV :/
---
Only thing that is a must when levelling a warrior is to keep your weapon up to date.  Whenever you can try and get an upgrade. Whether it's getting into a dungeon that has one, making sure to do some quest for one or finding one on the AH.  The biggest struggle is when you fall behind on your weapon and wondering why everything is so hard to kill.  
---
Oh, I’ve leveled a Ret Paladin so I’m well versed in chasing that sweet, sweet 2H upgrade. 
---
That is pretty much what I said. I said it does not give rage while out of combat. You just said it gives +0 rage  while out of combat instead of -2. That qualifies as "not giving rage while out of combat."
---
Which is odd, as it seems there's a lot of people who seem to genuinely hate the concept of classic on retail. 
---
That's why the original versions would be preferable if you want to deter those guys. It's more difficult to avoid confrontation when you have to fight all the NPCs at their original strength. Just a handful of defenders could gradually wittle down a raid if it was trying to run through all the guards to an objective. That's what forced most matches into tug-of-war zerg battles, with handfuls of people doing side-objectives. 
---
Love you Julian,
---
Zephan
---
I got the Razer Naga MMO mouse specifically for WoW, came with the numkeys all mapped.
---
Found the buttons were too close and not easy to tell by feel what you were clicking, so ended up using it as a regular mouse :(
---
T1 and talents are pretty much it. 
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
I mean, if you have the balls to tell your players "you think you do but you don't" chances are that's backed up by the downfall of any egotistical person, fragility in that ego. 
---
If we're going for the AV that I think most people are nostalgic for, it's the days long AV. That makes it less appealing to people focusing on Honor grinding through BG wins, but it appeals to the niche of people who liked that feeling of being in a battle that's literally lasted days. 
---
This argument doesn't work when they already are having some progression in patches. **1.12 is only a a real argument for talents. Talents are what they are so PvP isn't screwed.**
---
Every post that says "It was in 1.12" is completely useless. Naxx was out in 1.12. The AQ event was done and over in 1.12. The CHANGED blue PvP set was out in 1.12 that was better than tier 2 for a lot of classes was out in 1.12. None of that is going to happen at launch of Classic.
---
That isn't the way this works anymore, they aren't buy physical servers and building a data center anymore.  They can turn up and down service as needed from w/e provider they use, and have likely prepared for the inverse of what the OP posted, hence sharding.
---
&gt;Yeah, maybe they should re-introduce lag and disconnects as well, and have that 4-6 downtime every wednesday as well for updates.
---
lol... this is retarded you realize that right?
---
Hunter weps :( Destroyer of worlds is a hunter wep...... :(
---
" I feel like it could be used well if the community is mature about it and doesn't down rep people for no reason "
---
Pretty much guaranteed to happen. A certain burden of proof must be required to make something like that work properly.
---
So in your situation, they could also think it's the bottom picture. It starts with a lot of people, and in a relatively short time most of them are wiped out. Those that rebuild will be a closer community because of it.
---
The TBC launch was magical. Still remember how incredibly cool it was to go through the dark portal for the first time.
---
Or well, there was a huge faction war waged outside of the portal ganking everyone who was trying to go through, so it was more like a "I only have four meters to the portal so if I Rez here I might make it".
---
As I said, magical.
---
Alliance huh? Sorry to hear that brother. The pain of the breakup is only temporary. You'll get through this.
---
Personal Blacklist and Kasas KOS addons do something like this for individual players. Not sure if you can share that list, never tried. There's also realm forums for this kind of thing. 
---
Lol well I played both so I don't mind. 
---
True
---
"We just need someone for cleanse next fight"
---
"Open the gate just a little!"
---
Play another game if you are bored
---
tbh at the rate this is going I'm not even sure wow isn't dead by then
---
I'd take this with a grain of salt. If I remember correctly Druids were pretty weak in PVP overall.
---
To be fair his gear is transmogged, hidden shoulders, but yea if you saw the names that's where the real issue is
---
I would want one of the earlier versions, but if they only have the data from 1.12 we probably don't have a choice.
---
&gt; You made the point the only "choice" was Borean or Fjord. I pointed to another choice. You just said it's irrelevant. 
---
I said this:
---
&gt; completely different level ranges
---
Now kindly piss off.
---
Still not sure if being serious despite explicitly stating so 
---
Best is when you find an upgrade but its a 2h staff.
---
Keep her forever.
---
Meanwhile he changed 8 buffs to 16 debuffs in early tiers, trivializing nerfed content even more and then manipulated the audience to always think it was like this (lawyer). He also made a 2 plus year game 4 patch cycles. Both of these completely contradict what he said.
---
1) Ion shouldn't be the lead on Classic. One of the passionate people who wanted to make the project in the first place should be. It's a conflict of interest and also feeds the narrative that they are taking resources fro the modern game, which is one reason the official Classic forums are a complete sh#%show full of trolls.
---
2) That lead should have QA's like Ion does with modern WoW. Having Ion as the lead makes the chat toxic towards the modern game as well and it's unfair to both audiences. This basically costs the company basically nothing and they can get real feedback outside polluted forums where people have agendas and who never wanted Classic made in the first place and doesn't set two very different audiences at eachothers throats.
---
When I saw Ion come out at Blizzcon as the "lead" my heart dropped. When I heard him give his usual lawyer double speak, deep inside I knew Classic was screwed and that it didn't matter how hard the people worked under Ion or how much they wanted this to succeed and how passionate they were. Him and Brack have power over something they never wanted to make or that can make them look bad if it's a success. Nothing I have heard so far has changed that. Every design decision Ion has made as far as DM at release, itremization, debuffs harms the game immensely and those were all things you just can't screw up that were in no way hard fixes.
---
At this point Ion and Brack have to prove to me they don't want Classic to fail and aren't just using it as a trojan horse to get people to try modern WoW on the same client. Itemization, DM, debuffs, AV are things they just can't screw up. It's simply not Vanilla WoW with those things. It's Vanilla timewalking.
---
Might just be a lag issue but the one or three times it happened I remember panicking about an incoming snare or intercept and mashing the key as fast as possible then realizing I hit it too early only to be pleasantly surprised when no snare got applied.
---
That prairie dog should be in Tirisfal Glades with some daggers for how edgy it is.
---
And getting a cat that can stealth too makes them awesome in wpvp. 
---
They are scared that their time/money investment on live will become irrelevant. Scared that skill and dedication will become more important. This is why they despise the fact that Classic and Live will be seperate entities, with nothing carrying over.
---
If things keep going as they are now on retail I think it might even get a more "truly active" playerbase
---
Shammans are typically healer end game some raids bring 1 enhancement wielding nightfall but enhance shammy dps is pretty much nothing compared to eveything else. Elemental shammy mess shit up pvp tho. Imo enhancement isnt the way to go.
---
Simple...  2H prot build.
---
They can just re use all the dead bfa servers since there will be loads of those 
---
As a passionate gamer I don't
---
this guy doesn't marriage
---
I didn't try it with 4+% hit but I would believe it. Just wondering how you got 4% hit while leveling?
---
I predict the largest drop in active players for any game ever. 
---
100% 4K Confirmed.
---
If snowfall GY isn't initially horde controlled I will be upset.
---
It's not all about that nostalgia. I just started playing on a private server, just check if I want to play a Priest or a Paladin, but the more I play the more addicted I get.
---
I really have to control myself, so I don't sacrifice to much sleep.
---
The arms wonky build i was trying on a *xxxxxxx* server was pretty fun and relaxing.  I decided to go for crit in fury, anger management right away, then for piercing howl.
---
In no way do I say this is optimal, but it was fun for me.
---
Why not both/all versions and let people queue for multiple simultaneously?
---
IIRC, fire shield + thorns don't stack. Rain of fire is still good tho.
---
I’m gonna hype this game so much. Best game of all time, bout to come out? Holla.
---
Seems it's turned into a bit of a social version of Diablo where it's all about getting better gear. But for what purpose?
---
Crazy chicks is always great sex tho, you really need to think this through, maybe she can play with you while you play wow
---
I don't believe you! There is no such thing.
---
Night Elves also control that island in Feralas. 
---
Except...they aren't.  They're both follow-ons to an entry zone into Northrend.
---
And I pointed that out, and you said it was irrelevant anyway.
---
Seriously though dont roll warrior if you wamt world of casualcraft.
---
Nope. Nice try though. Oh wait it wasn't.
---
Ion is a lawyer himself, that prolly why he talks like he talks quite often :P
---
From what I understand, the horde are fairly securely in the ‘bad guy’ category now.
---
Theres just a handful of loud ]ower users, is all. 
---
I'm not very fond of Ion myself but credit where credit's due.
---
I mean when I level a warrior usually I go dual wield (level 20+) arms because of imp overpower till level 34 if alliance or sweeping strikes + ww axe if horde, level 36 you get ww so 2h axes is the best after level 36. And if you have shit gear just use 2h axes, 5% crit from talents early is huge  
---
For the lazy repetitive grinding just go arms, get your rend dps and aa to death. If you want to press more buttons go for dw with imp overpower...
---

Correct, this is the company that decided to go SJW over a WWII based game and tell its customers that if they don't like it don't buy it.

Enrage in world pvp over.... Arms?! What? You cant even intercept if you dont have tactical mastery lol.
---
What the hell happened to "No Gatekeeping"???? /s

Flurry will be just as consistent. Not the others. And no Fury is not more damage without /sit. 
---
On vanilla servers it's a community and people tend to quickly identify and shun the problem children. No need for an addon.
---
I don't care about historical recreation. I want to enjoy playing WoW again.
---
It makes sense. Vanilla was Direct X 9 and that can only really use 1 CPU thread. DX 11/12 can offload some stuff to other cores (one is still primary but it helps). 8.1 and they actually have decent mulitthreading and performance skyrocketed on a lot of newer cards.
---
In addition a lot was also put on the GPU that used to be on the CPU. 
---
If performance is mediocre in LARGE scenarios that aren't just network (hopefully Classic works much better than BFA here) shadows set to lowest is the first thing people should adjust. It's something many people will do anyways as it completely changes the look of Vanilla WoW past there. WoW had static shadows and circles (lowest shadow setting on player/NPC is still higher than this), but all art was designed around that limitation. 
---
I though the demo looked nice on Ultra everywhere except shadows and it's always going to be the biggest performance hog in a MMO anyways.  10 might be too high for foilage to. I like the new element in that it's interactive but sometimes there is just too much of it. Barrrens needs to look a little more barren. :)
---
Lmao the best warrior in the game who levels a warrior in 5 days on average levels arms every time. But lets trust this random pleb
---
It depends on what you call mandatory. It depends on what item level you're pushing for.
---
You can gear up with PvP alone if you really want to. You won't reach Tier 2 quality gear unless you can hit Rank 13/14 though. It's a fairly minor difference, though, considering there's not really any competitive.
---
Aside from the PvP quartermaster in the City each battleground has its own reputation and vendor that grants access to gear (Warsong Outriders, etc).
---
I saw this happen with albion online at launch.  There were so many issues that really hurt the core game, and fixes took months.  The hardcore stuck it out, but most of them are gone now as well.
---
I can't wait to see how things turn out in the long term.  I plan to be playing all the way through so we'll see first hand how the drop will effect things.
---
But surely you can't be!?
---
Get Anger Management in arms then get talents based on what gear you want. You can even go prot and sword n board with anger management and still have a chill time.
---
Excellent strategy.  Don't make any points so I have nothing to argue with.
---
I recognize your optimism but unfortunately don't share it. I hope you're right.
---
By making friends with a Paladin 
---
Ok but du you enjoy Vanilla or not?
---
Hey I get it. For people who rely on queue'd content, hate having to go places, desire flying and find resource management or other RP heavy elements like bullets as 'tedious'.... classic is everything they should hate. Retail has catered to a lot of these people, and it seems like they want to see classic fail because it represents things they hate. 
---
I have a level 100 or something character (I used a free trial and free boost to get some cross promotional thing).
---
I can no longer log into it without a sub.
---
I can make a new lvl 1 character, though, as a "trial" or some such.
---
Are you saying I can level that char to lvl 10 and then post on forums?
---
This is a hoax, and very old news.
---
I mean it'll probably be possible, either with an option in video settings or through some kind of cusotm mod, the same way some folks make the Void elves have the High Elves models/skins etc.
---
Question is, would you need a weird custom WoW launcher to run modification to the game's landscape/graphics etc.
---
if activision held a gun to your head, whats the last thing or secret you would say about classic wow before he makes you unsubscribe from life
---
I'm having a hard time reading your post with you waving that white flag in my face. You're arguing with your own failed interpretation of what people are actually saying.
---
No doubt. Especially since it's linked to retail subs, I feel like a huge amount of the retail base that isn't really that into the idea of classic but want to give it a try will make a character, get out of the valley of trials or maybe the first zone and then realize this really isn't the game for them.
---
Shit, I might end up doing that too, depends if my friends play too
---
Most people who played back then barely did Molten Core.
---
One my alts was a mage with just Rank 10 set and a mish mash of dungeon loot and the only epics were from Alterac Valley.
---
Still did fine during and after 1.11 when Naxx came out and ran into Naxx geared folk.
---
I really feel like minor changes could be made that wouldn't affect the gameplay for anyone but these specs. 
---
Boomkin's biggest crutch, I'd say is the lack of hit available to them. If their 5 talent point thing that gave them 3% damage per talent (up to 15) also gave 1% hit, so they'd get 5% hit from talents, it'd help them so much. Who would be hurt by something like that?
---
Like I said I'm not arrogant enough to believe that my opinion is the valid one and everyone who enjoys retail is wrong.
---
Furthermore I haven't followed wow since wotlk. So I can't even compare them. 
---
Credit what? Every decision he has made so far harms the community and makes the first two tiers easier than LFR and much less accurate than things amateurs did years ago. Interns could put in the right itemization since people like Nost did all the hardwork, laboriously looking things up and comparing them on internet archives.
---
No comment on AV is a huge red flag and he very well knows people want to know this. That means it's going to be completely ruined and the TBC design which was built around BG's not even mattering. Again this is worse than what we had with amateurs and is simply not excusable for a product that we are paying for.
---
4 patches means it's going to be greatly accelerated and resemble HIS modern game more, which is just a horrible gear carousel with no space and time where you can just do whatever you want and actually \*shocker\* enjoy the world and game. All Ion cares about is raiding and he probably thinks all anyone cares about is racing to Nax. I couldn't hand pick a worse person to be in charge of WoW. Listen to the collector's DVD and raiding is NOT supposed to be what Vanilla WoW was only about. Kaplan flat out said that PvP is where you can "show what you got". 
---
Please tell me why I should have any faith in Ion or Brack. Every decision has harmed the game and community, by nerfing already nerfed content due to 1.12 and the modern client (heals will land instantly instead of on a delay on tanks) and accelerating a game with patches which had no need to be accelerated. 
---
I couldn't hand pick two worse people to be in charge or Classic than Brack or Ion. Both thought that game need changed and "fixed" and both give passive aggressive comments in every interview they give about how the game has "warts" etc. Both drastically changed the game for the worse when they worked at Blizzard. Both are patronizing narcissists who should never be in front of a microphone who actually think they can tell people what they "really want". Modern WoW is failing due to Ion and Brack in big part. I don't want Ion near Classic at all. I want one of the excited people who worked on the old game there and who understand why we liked it in the first place.
---
The fact THOSE employees have to say "modern WoW is what we would make if we were making Classic now" is a joke. That means they are complete yes men and Blizzard is a culture of fear where the modern game is all that matters. Every single interview and word I have heard from everyone involved makes me lose faith in this project more.
---
It's almost to the point the only thing I am excited about is that we will eventually get a Nost with accurate boss abilities that actually makes an effort to recreate all the other stuff that also mattered.
---
Hopefully they'll give access to players who actually played Vanilla first.
---
Airplane!
---
It's called sarcasm.  I did not actually think your post was smart.
---
I thought that was DICE/EA?
---
do you rush consecration for the grind or do you level ret?
---
&gt;Credit what?
---
The quote I posted.
---
&gt;want
---
I like to think that the old Blizzard wouldn't bother with this kind of double talk. They'd just own up to what they're going to do or not going to do, and at worst just stay silent until they figured it out.
---
And no one has fixed her hair yet.
---
I did yes, but the question isn't as simple as you're making it out to be. I'm not a private server player. Stuff like guild banks that apparently weren't added until BC but that I don't remember, stuff like that doesn't really affect me. Old vs new graphics...I don't care all that much.
---
But recreating patch 1.12, with all of its content nerfs and gear buffs, combined with ~15 years worth of player experience and modding...that could be a problem. Vanilla wasn't a cakewalk. But a simple "historical recreation" of specifically patch 1.12 might be.
---
The response I usually see from the private server crowd "well, of course it's going to be easy, because I've been running the same exact content over and over for three years." But I haven't been doing that, and a trivially easy experience isn't what vanilla was and it's not what I want from Classic.
---
1) This won't happen for two plus years, which is plenty of time to see if it should be continued.
---
2) If it does then Classic is a sabotaged, dumbed down, accelerated product that was only continued as a project after the old CEO and founder of Blizzard was ousted to get people on modern WoW by two narcissists (Ion/Brack). That means it's going to be a disaster anyways.
---
Grab some popcorn and enjoy the show. Either way we win. We will have 1.12 values now on boss abilities. We will have pathing. If Blizzard fails with Classic due to horrible leader ship amateurs will do it right.
---
That was EA, though it definitely seems that these mega publishers are actively seeking new and novel ways to disgust their customers. 
---
Well I hope it runs better. I had some graphic issues in two areas on the old client, which I could fix only with massive performance losses.
---
I like your plan for this, &amp; I agree this should be exciting for anyone playing the current game, or who have played many expansions. 
---
I personally like the idea of bringing new continents with a plan or need to return to them in future updates and expansions. You can tell they planned to do that in the first place, scrapped content for later use. The Dragon Shrine tower thing in Wrath could easily be utilized later. Anub'Arak could have been a lesser or behind the scenes bad guy to appear later. Zul'drak was supposed to have more to it...
---
I like your idea of Outlands being last. It's really difficult to go there &amp; have a reason to go back... With the prescense of Old Gods &amp; Titans being beneath the surface, you can go back to old continents to face new threats. I feel like there'd never be "new" threats in Outland. 
---
Sometimes there is little you can do.
---
So... people get three day bans for "gatekeeping". And this makes the front page? Coooool.
---
Everyone i know had that active since it was implemented and no one of them got a closed beta invitation ever. There are literally millions of people suscribed to that and we already know widely how blizzard shares invitations, which is youtubers and streamers first.
---
Id take these with a grain of salt. These are private server numbers. God knows what classic is going to come up with after they put 1.12 values into the retail number cruncher. 
---
Ok so you enjoy vanilla. You know this. So why would you risk making changes when you KNOW you enjoy vanilla but you don't know if you like vanilla with changes? Bear in mind, if they make 1 change you like they may also make 100 changes you don't like...
---
*"do not bite off more than you can chew"*
---
The shimmering flats will always have a weird soft spot in my heart
---
Im good with gold.
---
Past 30 in always rich from grinding the right beasts.  My last hunter I did 32-40 in desolace 75% grinding, past 40 theres a lot of spot I like to grind too. Its not really slower than questing but more boring for sure.
---
My last war I did have that LH helm at lvl 56, used the 2hit shoulder from brd at 55. Mara ring but I only had devilsaur leg whiles levelling.
---
You can get rune of the guard captain depending if blizz releases quest hub in hinterlands on release.
---
Satyrs bow is lvl 58+ if released too.
---
I did switch right at 49 and saw a clear upgrade from 2h with executionner’s cleaver. Some fights you just miss cauz of rnjesus but most times the dps is just insane. That was abusing /sit macro tough
---
I understand what it is &amp; I just think it's retarded. Time travel doesn't belong in the WoW universe, &amp; it was created as a way to pull people in via Nostalgia. "ooooh! opening the dark portal!" "wow, the purge of Stratholme!" "Awesome! the WC3 finale!" 
---
I'm not trying to be rude, btw. You're absolutely right about what you said. I just think it could have been utilized in a way that doesn't ruin the whole story. 
---
It could have been really cool to have the bronze dragonflight be more of seers than time-traveling saviors. They open up a portal to prepare adventurers &amp; heroes alike for the upcoming challenges. For instance, if Deathwing starts tearing up fools &amp; becoming a world-wide threat, the bronze dragonflight creates a dungeon to run that places you in a previous time where Deathwing was a threat, or was relevant. He may even be an ally at that point, but the purpose is to understand the enemy to find a weakness or avoid a devestating plan. Not necessarily predicting the future, but using history to succeed? IDK if that sounded dumb. 
---
Actually tje numbers wont be identical to 1.12. They have to massage the data to fit the retail engine. 
---
I'm super happy for Vanilla fans regardless of what my opinion on it is, and I will definitely be focusing on vanilla as a few of my friends and I are starting a guild on whatever realm we choose. I just wish there was more support for a TBC release as that is where I feel WoW was at its peak. It had everything Vanilla had and introduced more content such as arenas and made more specs viable as far as pvp was concerned. I love retail, even with all its faults as it has brought me just as much joy as it has sadness, but I'll be switching over possibly for good. 
---
Who hurt you? Jesus...
---
2h fury is definitely viable on horde.
---
A lot of the world textures are new in the demo. This is things like terrain, walls, books, potions on tables. The old character and creature models look better due to AA, HBAO+ (Ambient Occlusion). Character models and creature models CLOSE UP really don't matter because Classic is truly a MASSIVE Mulitplayer game unlike the modern version. You are going to be playing zoomed out pretty far most of the time and it looks fine.
---
Here is someone who got the demo and had some fun (maybe he used Ansel or something to do this) and who actually has a decent bitrate (1440p). the major changes to the WoW client have been lighting, shadows, Ambient Occlusion, Water (required a newer Direct X). All these things are an option in the demo. 
---
STV. Pay attention to the eagle/flightmaster which comes alive due to the ambient occlusion. That same eagle texture looks laughable in old WoW because it has no shadows/ao on the feathers face etc.
---

---
Graphics are the last thing to worry about with Classic WoW. 
---
With such a low bar to entry, the ones who remain will be the truly wretched.
---
It wasn't nice because he contradicted himself with 4 content patches and 16 debuffs in early tiers. He proved that comment means NOTHING within minutes of saying it.
---
Honestly? I think that TBC servers will be discussed not too long after Classic release. I agree with you, I think TBC was the best expansion, and I would 100% go back and raid Karazhan again (best raid in WoW imo).
---
It'll be interesting to see what Blizzard does after classic!
---
The private servers that are Blizzlike are only active because of legal loopholes that will be closed with Classic's release. This may be our last chance for a real vanilla experience without sharding and autobans for pvp.
---
This guy works for the mob. Trust me don't listen to a word he says.
---
The problem is that the understandably the no changes playerbase doesn't want anything that could possibly interfere with the vanilla experience. Do I think sharding is a great tool if implemented correctly? Yes. Normally it would be used without much backlash, but because it was not present in Vanilla they don't want it. I have no stance on it as I wanted toggled player models to be present, but the vocal minority is too strong and its not going to happen. It's a very damned if you do damned if you don't situation. 
---
It's not about being right. It's about sounding right so you get ez upvotes.
---
They'll lose more players on HoTS and Retail before they lose players on Overwatch, it's currently the only game they have right now will consistent numbers that don't rise and fall as massively as WoW has in recent years.  
---
Until people remember it's World of Grindcraft and quit. 
---
Blizzard had to be careful about adding mana regen items, since mana management is the primary mechanic for healers, and they didn't want to trivialize healing.  They addressed this in TBC with mana regen / cost reduction talents deep in DPS trees that were inaccessible to healers.  I think classic would be better with those changes blended into the 1.12 talent trees.
---
Lol this is perfect, thanks
---
I think most of the people working on this project are great, especially the tech people. I have lauded the graphics tweaks and options. I have lauded a new API being used, because DX 9 and old Open GL suck. 
---
Ion and Brack have done nothing in YEARS for me to compliment and Ion has already done things to harm Classic. There's nothing I can praise. The person who agreed to make Classic was the CEO. Blizzard no longer has a CEO. They have a guy who patronized us and a guy who patronizes the entire WoW audience.
---
They have yet to prove to me they want to make this or that they are making sure it's good on it's own and not just timewalking that is engineered to fail in half the time frame due to being dumbed down, just to get people on the modern game.
---
Let me know when they do or when Ion doesn't contradict every word out of his mouth. Lawyer speak doesn't work on me. ACTIONS do.
---
Just to be up front, I'm not for no changes, there are actually a ton I'd love to see, but on sharding I go both ways.  I understand it is necessary at launch, and I really do mean necessary, but I would also be completely against it being used in the game overall. 
---
That being said it's not going to matter how vocal people are, sharding is going to be part of launch, if it's not, there are going to be a shit load of dead servers 6 months after launch which no one should want.  Blizzards is going to want to turn up as few servers as they possibly can, not because of cost, because seriously, it's not far from trivial, but for the long term health of those servers.  Sharding in a limited manner can help alleviate having massive player caps for launch only, and let them turn them back down to more reasonable levels later.
---
That's DICE/EA. Activision added females to their WW2 multiplayer on CoD but not in the campaign so it really didn't matter. Not to mention, Activision also doesn't claim to make historically accurate war games unlike DICE so there goes that.
---
I doubt they will be able to shut them all down. However I did want to mention that but forgot.
---
Why wouldn’t they be able to shut them down it’s there product? Do you know how copyright works?
---
Rogue will probably be up there, same with mage since it's so good for farming. A lot of warriors in the beginning, few will make it all the way to 60. Hunters have always been plentiful, but a good hunter is like finding a needle in a haystack. The only one that isn't needed for anything in raids is probably rogues, might be one of the reasons so many will play them.
---
You apparently haven’t paid attention to the recent backlash against Overwatch. 
---
Nice!
---
I always played a shadow priest. Never played classic though (came in at TBC). Are shadow priests wanted in classic? My experience with interacting others was "priests heal!!!1111" back in the day.
---
My friend started in BC and never played Classic. We are going to have so much fun. It's going to be a blast. I have some other friends who want to come play too but i think they will get bored fast and roll out after they realize leveling takes a while. 
---
i think youre forgetting the whole point of classic.  this isnt for progression in the future its for classic.. the fact people have been playing vanilla on numerous different servers for 10 years tells you this.    youll have classic for like 2 years going off the timeline blizz said and after that you either re roll or you quit after finishing naxx or completing the goals you want, this game is not your fucking life career.
---
It was so much fun. I really hope they will bring us BC servers int he future as well. That would be awesome. 
---
*YOU THINK SOMEBODY SHOULD TELL HIM?*
---
*58 upvotes*
---
this mindset tells me classic aint for you mate.  the whole point is to play classic nobody gives a fuck about the expansions and future content
---
This might sound stupid, but I would be so fucking pleased with that. Go through vanilla all the way up through MoP and stop there. Rinse and repeat 
---
The literary musings of mark twen
---
I can't remember specifically, but I think I started AV'ing in, or close to, AV 1.12 version. I started played in the Spring of 2006 and 1.12 came out in August/2006. I have a lot of great memories of AV back the, while I was working towards the highest PVP rank title :)
---
The version of when there were airships flying over the map (unless that post was a spoof that I read a while back) would be really awesome so experience, as well. I'd love that!!  I just want the more immersive AV back. I miss seeing the AV bosses summoned. It's very rare to see that anymore in Live game.
---
On the private server I'm playing on, which is pretty vanilla, Mages are extremely popular. It's hard not to be in a dungeon group without one or even two each time. Factor in that they're supposedly an extremely fast leveling/gold earning class with AOE farming and bring good damage and utility, I would think that of the three they'd be the most popular by far.
---
Hunters are known for their EZ-mode leveling so expect to see quite a few when classic launches as people shoot straight for 60.
---
I've seen very few rogues, which leads me to believe they're not nearly as popular as the others. Still I expect rogue's reputation for being WPVP slayers to factor in somewhat on launch.
---
Even if I had no interest in playing classic I would still hope it did well. The reason retail is suffering so much now is because WoW hasn't had a proper competitor; the developers have become complacent. If classic does well and the playerbase plummets something has to be done, even if they share sub. 
---
Bringing in more subs would also lead to more money for development, and classic shouldn't need much unless they plan on making changes (which they've been clear wont be happening for at least a while), so all the new subs would pay for retail devs. 
---
So you're saying the instances would be more like the holodeck?
---
I think in the lore, COT wasn't about changing anything.  The Infinite Dragonflight for some reason started trying to change things, and the Bronze Dragonflight tried to keep it secure.
---
Now, in TBC and WotLK, that's how it was applied.  In Cata, you started using the past to change the future (i.e. collect the Dragon Soul) and you finally killed the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight.
---
I agree that time travel can be messy, but I think that was the point in WoW:  time travel is messy, and therefore we have to take out anyone who is affecting time.
---
Grinding makes the accomplishments mean more
---
I feel you, my gf broke up with me recently, I liked her, but hey my money will be saved my time and i can play classic. :D 
---
Holy-Disc would be to be a true healer/damage hybrid. I.e. I would plan to heal most of the time, but help burst down opponents when needed and possibly win a 1 on 1 situation as well.
---
&gt;Healing in PvP is kinda boring IMO as a priest but that’s because I know how strong you can become as shadow.
---
Yeah, I think I have to at least experience Shadow for myself. Thanks for the feedback.
---
I’ve had my Naga for almost 5 years now and it’s still in great shape and I love it :)....actually probably one of the better purchases I’ve ever made I think 
---
And at some point in BC they increased the CD
---
Yes. You can level up to level 20 for free.
---
Didn't you not hear? 4k is old news, it's all about 8k now.
---
Yeah but in my opinion Russel Hobbs has better speccs when it comes to multislicer campaigns.
---
Why aren't they shutting them all down right now?
---
&gt; So you're saying the instances would be more like the holodeck?
---
Just the Caverns of Time dungeons. I don't really know what a holodeck is. Maybe I should look it up. Yes, I'd say a magical holodeck. Kind of like how what's his tits in Ready Player One looked back at one dude's history, but this would be more interactive. Pretty much a "use this piece of history to learn more about your enemy."
---
&gt; we have to take out anyone who is affecting time.
---
The Infinite dragonflight should never have been made in my opinion. I understand it's a reactionary thing with the bronze dragonflight, but the concept was made by Blizzard and I think it was a mistake.
---
Nothing wrong with that. Modern gaming is all about 15-30 minutes gaming sessions where you're expecting to get some reward for your actions. Modern gaming is all about reactions and skill rather than character development. WoW transformed over the years to a completely different game and the fact that there are still millions of subscribers tells that developers did a great job keeping game alive. And yes, it means that those who liked old WoW largely were left behind. I feel like developers care about us, they are trying to make things for us, but, of course, it's not enough and they can't risk upsetting those millions who are jumping every day for a chunk of gameplay. Honestly I consider Classic as a gift and I'm grateful.
---
If you're not interested in being a FoM class or one that is extremely good then you should play the Druid and accomplish nothing with your life during Vanilla. You're outhealed, outdpsed, and outtanked on every level. :D Do what I'm doing and enjoy the life of mediocrity my friend. 
---
They run the servers on HP C7000 Platinum Chassis. THey are not some shitty weak cloud based servers. All those blades that they sold with the signatures and all that? That is a server. The newer ones can handle some serious shit. 
---
Executioner's cleaver compared to Krol Blade or Deep Woods is a bit unfair. I would say compare Ice Barbed Spear instead. Even then, deep woods and Krol Blade actually cost money where IBS is free.  Although for fresh, IBS may not be out so there is something to be said there. 
---
Good with gold is one thing. Making ~500 gold for LH Helm and another ~250+ for devilsaur leg just sounds like insane luck or youre handicapping your leveling speed to make money. And another what 50 g for deep woods ? 
---
Vanilla almost feels incomplete when you look at the limited variety of armor sets. If your class can be a healer then expect to only receive healing tier sets. If you are a warrior then you get only tank sets and you get *the* only tank sets.
---
Adding new raids to the existing tiers would be great for filling in those gaps. The new Legendaries they could bring would be pretty fun as well.
---
Sounds like this expansion is literally AIDS. 
---
Well, if you have a phone you can play DIABLO IMMORTAL!!!! No PC required!!!
---
In all seriousness, you could get away with a \~$500 PC for what you are wanting. SoupaSoka's suggestion would set you up just fine if all you care to play is Classic. You can also use PCPartpicker to aim a little higher if you want to have the option of playing other newer PC games on the market but since you have a console that may not matter to you. You can just follow someone else's build there if you want to go for something more beefy.
---
TBC is by far when wow peaked. Classic will be fun but I also wish it was TBC
---
Only if they give Taurens +10 dmg when fighting Centaur.
---
I hate vanilla because i can't pick a class.
---
Memes are the source and undoing of creativity. It's crazy. And every sub/forum is drowning in them. 
---
I'll admit, I might just be to old. But "in the good old days" forums was all about questions, answers, tips, tricks, discussions about the game. Nowadays it's cheap memes for "likes". 
---
This is it, f*ck it, It is what it is.
---
Don’t call me Shirley. 
---
Same for me. I consider sharding a principal point for myself, so I'm going to put myself into queue until sharding is completely disabled. Also want to avoid the initial chaos, not really like it.
---
Maybe next time
---
You can definitely get by with PvP and some light raiding. If you do not have the time to raid you don’t have the time to grind R14. You can get decent army through PvP and 20 mans or a raid guilds alt runs. Eventually you will be outpaced by raiders though. Even R14 fear falls off late AQ and totally by Naxx. 
---
Mage and Rogue are the most popular 
---
However Warrior and Hunter are more fun imo especially if you play PvP
---
Do they even use their own hardware at this point? You could rent thousands of servers in Amazon or Google cloud instantly and those servers will be powerful. With modern infrastructure scaling problem is gone.
---
No kidding. I would create an eternal Karazhan guild just to be able to run than instance over and over again.
---
I think a lot of points can only be made once we see the results of the release, but it gives you room to discuss them none the less. Such as how much it *could* change the gaming industry.
---
I think a lot of it comes down to companies wanting to make more money with less effort.
---
That then resulted in the change of audience. Don't quote me, but the way some features were executed, make me think it's directed at people with more money to spend on the game (pets and mounts having whole trailers on them).
---
But I'm like at least 3 years behind you in education, so I'll stop.
---
Maybe I just have fat fingers or something - I was always pressing multiple buttons.
---
Ungoro buff is reflect damage too
---
You had me until you mentioned Cata. Imo, that is truly where the game nose-dived 
---
His leveling vids are awesome.
---
&gt; So why would you risk making changes when you KNOW you enjoy vanilla but you cant know if you like vanilla with changes?
---
&gt;"opening pandora's box". Why risk it?
---
&gt;I'm a no-changer.
---
This is an issue that's already been discussed at great length. Blizzard isn't giving us vanilla. They're building some sort of of hybrid that uses Legion code with vanilla data imported into it. People can chant "no changes" all day long, but _that's what they're doing_.
---
It's silly and counterproductive to stick our heads in the sand and pretend otherwise. It's altogether likely that stuff in this hybrid monstrosity may need to change to _make it more like vanilla_, and Blizzard even acknowledged this ~6 months ago in that first dev watercooler post. Some of these issues have already come up. Like loot trading for instance. That was there because it was in the Legion code not because they "added" it, but now Blizzard wants it there because it makes life easier for them. Stuff like this might need to be changed.
---
&gt;&gt;a trivially easy experience isn't what vanilla was and it's not what I want from Classic.
---
&gt;I don't think anyone wants that...
---
But that may be what happens, if things are left as they are. Take a quick look at [this](https://i.redd.it/qq80ejtz0h921.png) from yesterdays' post about progressive itemization. Between launch and patch 1.12, that particular example item went from a chance to reduce targets armor by 300 to a debuff that reduces it by 700, that can be stacked 3 times...plus it gained +16 stamina. Multiply that out by hundreds of item changes, and it looks like me like the game is going to be a whole lot easier than it was for most of its life. People are going to be going into raids with all the late-vanilla class changes. Patch 1.12 had increased raid loot drops because Blizzard wanted more people to see end game content before BC made it all obsolete.
---
Here's a list of assorted [raid and dungeon nerfs and loot buffs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gbi-GkbuYup9XGbLI2YQPrjlRDZQRe5Dv5cUkmL-Nso/edit?usp=sharing). It's _eight pages_ long.
---
1.12 as it is with no changes could give us a game that's utterly easy-mode.
---
How does looting usually work for things like PUGs? From what I've seen a lot of guilds will be looking for random players to fill out their teams come rad night. If you're one of those randos, can you just expect to get shafted and not get anything at all for you efforts? I could easily see a disreputable guild funneling all the goodies to their guildmates.
---
Gladiator :P nice
---
No end game content? You strive to become a fucking legend, and feared by the enemy.
---
Why do people think that cloud servers are cheap micro? Amazon m5.24xlarge: 96 xeon cores, 384 GB RAM. You could rent up to xeon platinum (fastest server CPU in the world), you could rent up to 768 GB RAM. Those are not weak servers, those are incredible powerful servers, developers could only dream about those beasts in 2004.
---
A computer 
---
Thanks dude this sham is my pride and joy 
---
Why would they be a issue right now? Has blizzard released classic? Also a lot of reputable private servers have already closed.
---
To be fair, Tauren should get +10 damage when fighting Gnomes. 
---
If by MoP you mean WotLK
---
Holodeck is from Star Trek.  You should watch The Next Generation, Voyager, or Deep Space Nine to really get an idea of what it is.  (It's also used on The Orville, but I don't think they call it a Holodeck).
---
Most of the time in Star Trek it's used to bring to life long-dead historical figures.  They do a lot of Sherlock Holmes, westerns, and other things in the holodeck.
---
The thing I find funny is, you don't like that the Infinite Dragonflight exists, which makes them a perfect villain for you.
---
The guild would probably get a bad rap pretty quickly then no one would want to pug with them. 
---
But Taurens are squishy targets for the mighty centaur axes BWAHAHA. Every Centaur knows that from Kolk to Magram. BWAHAHAHA. Run and hide in your hills, horned one. 
---
I think he was just being cheeky.
---
Karazhan is still the king of raids
---
&gt; vanilla data imported into it
---
&gt;it’s there product? Do you know how copyright works?
---
Okay I don't understand what you've said then.
---
Anyway, bye.
---
That's chump change compared to all of Blizzard's other IP's. Until player count starts dropping like flies, it's still a fantastically successful IP and is very stable. 
---
Keep in mind that there are 9 classes and that recent polls have shown that ~16-18% is the cap for any class.
---
If warrior rogue hunter and mage (in no real order) are the 18, 16, 14, 12 roughly speaking, that would mean that around 60% of people are playing 4 classes. That means the other 40 are playing 5 classes. Keep in mind as well that Shaman/Paladin are less played due to restrictions, and that Druid and warlock are less played because they are simply less played and you have a pretty reasonable layout for understanding what will be popular.
---
Also, not surprisingly DPS classes are usually the most popular. If you pick a healer, you’re automatically more desireable.
---
Do you not understand, or were you repeating to try to distract me from the issue?
---
Seems to contradict adding sharding and loot trading. Those are literally modern solutions to old problems.
---
Honestly, I'm fine with trying for the most accurate version of 1.12, because that is the best chance at success. That said, though, the game isn't literally magic. It isn't some mystery why it was a good game. To me, the way it was setup to be more community focused is what made it great.
---
That's why I'm puzzled about how people approach this topic. The game wasn't amazing because of how it was balanced, so I wouldn't care at all about balance tweaks. The only reason people want them is pure nostalgia, no other reason. Yet I'll see the same people saying the game should have a much higher than release population, which has a direct impact on the community and is thus 1,000 times more severe of a change.
---
Maybe that is why we should change as little as possible, though. People will never agree on what should be changed, and too many people don't see the consequences of changes, especially private server personalities who never played vanilla retail and are asking for 10k pop.
---
You haven't even played it
---
I actually enjoyed the hell out of MoP and all of content changes it brought along except for the loss of our talent trees. The raids were excellently designed, Challenge modes were fun and pvp was equally great. The only problem I feel most people had were dailies, pandas and an incredibly long final patch before WoD. It was still a great expansion, as was Cata. Yes they weren't the best, but they are massively better than anything they've released in the last 5 years. 
---
I doubt Blizzard cares about the feelings of their developers. If one product is more profitable than another they're more likely to kick the developers in the ass for being wrong about what constitutes good game design.
---
Wotlk is much more widely regarded as the last expansion still worth playing. Mop was horrible in my opinion 
---
Isn't sharding a modern solution to a new problem given that the server architecture is different?
---
I wouldn’t know, stopped playing, but dungeon-finder in late wrath and raid-finder in cata completely ruined the game for me.
---
When you could just queue into things the world got smaller and more lonely.
---
I did this, got addicted and deleted my character after a huge rollback that wiped a huge part of my progress. That rollback saved me lol.

Doesn't matter if it is a game. If yoir girlfriend prevents you from doing the things that you enjoy doing in your life then you should break up with her. 
---
Vast majority of pservers are hosted in Europe because of a specific law that allows emulation of old games if the copyright holder does not provide the service. Once Classic is out, every server gets a cease and desist letter and every server shuts down. 
---
The only pservers that would be running would have to be hosted in third world countries that just don't care about this kind of stuff, so you'll have very limited options, most likely have to start from scratch again, and deal with really bad ping. 
---
Not to mention that a ton of players are going to just leave without any prompting as soon as classic is launched anyway. 
---
Considering that the upcoming Classic is being made to run basically on (7.3.5) Legion client, I think you may want to build a PC that would be able to handle Legion requirements well. So I'd recommend looking the recommended specs and aiming for that.
---
Perhaps we mean Cataclysm. The world dies... for real. 
---
Reading that made me angry at how true it is.
---
I understand what you are saying I do. But doing pvp and having your pvp guild and seeing Pve guilds owning everyone because raid gear is overwhelming Superior and being forced to do Pve in order the aquire competitive gear also sucked arse. Specially considering how specs worked then. And how pvp ranking worked as well 
---
I remember the complaints.
---
I'm not saying BC solution was good. But it was made for a reason, to try and fix an issue.
---
Hm yeah I like that better.
---
Okay thanks for helping me understand that.
---
I have played on a few private servers that I didn't realize are from third world countries, so that's why I was confused.
---
However, my later reply was that I don't think every private server will be banned. So to that, I think it comes down to preference. 
---
Not talking about a PvP guild but PvP server
---
There s a quest in duskwood totem of affliction.
---
Gives 50 armor and has a chance to inflict damage when struck.
---
Im testing bear aoe leveing atm with shit items. Lvl 31 so far and I could always kill 3 mobs level -1-2 usually.
---
You can go feral till lvl 27 and then switch to balance to eventully get omen of clarity and imp thorns. Then back to feral till 31/31 and 5 points furor late 50s in resto tree.
---
So far this looks like an insane grinding build :) quick for quests too ofc, druids are leveling beasts!
---
We did but blizzard didn't want us to have proper patch have progression
---
Mostly all ret. Single target is so efficient there's no recovery time. Consecrate can help pick up multiple mobs, but the LOW damage and high mana rate mean more time is spent recovery than gained in kill speed.
---
- 8 prot for Precision
---
- Ret the rest of the way.
---
I don't rush ret to seal of command at 21, since at 20, we get Verigan's Fist, which is amazing, but at 3.2 sec command isn't as crucial, and Righteousness (and maybe even Crusader depending on Classic math) does really well for faster 2 handers, especially given ~15 second fights. --- I'm dying waiting for Beta to test out math.
---
I'd go into holy from 20-30 for imp righteousness with Verigan's Fist, but at 15% bonus vs 25% more from imp judge, we just go down ret tree from 17 to 48.
---
Make an alt 
---
Pvp 
---
I love how you can't deny that you took a load of drugs 
---
I'm all for the game being time consuming and hard, like it used to be.  It makes your accomplishments more satisfying.  Retail wow doesn't really feel like an mmorpg to me. Everything is too easy, dumbed down, linear, and leveling really has no meaning (like leveling). I'm in my 30s, so I'm an older gaming generation.  To me, an mmorpg = time consuming to be elite, a long (non linear) journey, difficult, and full of choices to build your character.  
---
The reality is there will be a wave that dies out. I hope already existing communities (like r/classicwow) can choose a server that will exist mostly of longterm players.
---
I'm not 100% clear on the honor system, but Ion said during the Classic panel that they don't want PvP gear in the game until the second stage, to avoid PvP gear being better than PvE gear during stage one. I'm assuming that means there won't be a honor system, but maybe they will implement it and let you grind ranks even though the rewards aren't in the game yet. Not idea. I'd think they would release the honor system at the same time as the rewards, but that wasn't explicitly said. 
---
If by WotLK you mean WoD. 
---
Serves as a great reminder why I should quit.
---
Exactly my thoughts. I saw the panel + the roadmap and it specifically said "Honor **rewards**" in phase 2. I wouldn't mind having the PvP system in place for grinding ranks for anyone that wants to, and then whoever chose to PvP can get some gear once BWL is released.
---
Old? Don't tell me they messed with it by flooding it or some crazy shit like that...
---
I mean, not to sound like a dick, but I couldn't care less. A lot of people cried about the changes to the game which were insignificant when you compare the massive difference between Wrath and TBC. To each his own, but MoP still had a much larger playerbase than any expac after, and was enjoyable. You can stop at WotLK, but MANY people will keep going well into the next couple of expacs if they did that. 
---
I think this is the most understanding post about retail lovers ive seen on this sub. No attacking retail players or how the game is now just because it’s different from how it was. Its honestly refreshing. 
---
Imo you should go rogue. They're super strong in pvp. And the t1/mc gear is actually really good for rogues. And with MC being totally pugable, you can for sure farm the gear there. 
---
Good analysis. I do miss the old AV, when it wasn't a rush to the end boss with only a couple towers downed. You had to actually work together to do all these little side missions, that would strengthen your teams position, while trying to defend against the enemy doing the same.  You couldn't solo cap or summon anything, you needed a group for almost everything. It was a struggle start to finish. And if both sides held their own, and no more bonuses could be brought forth, you dug in and charged each other to see who outlasted the other in an open field conflict at the bottleneck. The wins were GLORIOUS, and losses were painful. 
---
I thought it was there to alleviate starting zone overcrowding
---
&gt;It's an MMO, nothing is mandatory. You could be one of those guys making PvP videos where you strip down to just your jimmies and a worn dagger and still go out and ~~kick ass.~~ get rekt repeatedly for hours on end until you get the one highlight you can post on youtube
---
The one that doesn’t take 3 days.
---
If we do get that version then I will stick with 24/7 WSG.
---
We are getting vanilla with the true actual data and we have no idea how classic will be. Nothing you say are relevant right now.
---
[Force Reactive Disk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18168)
---
You guys have way too much trust in blizzard to change, add or balance anything that wasn't in vanilla. Planed or not, it doesn't matter. Expecting people with totally different design vision to keep vanilla "fresh" by adding new content that doesn't take away from the old?
---
Heh...well call me pessimistic if you will, but just reading the things you guys write and the way you write it, you brains are like being back in 2005, where the actual team that made the game we are currently looking forward to was.
---
HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
---
Im deciding between a rogue or warlock alt that will mainly be used for gathering herb/mining and farming gold. But will also get some playtime in raids/pvp. My 2 choices are rogue and warlock. 
---
So basically what routes do rogues and warlocks have of farming gold outside of the gathering? I know rogues can pickpocket BRD, and warlocks can farm mara/DME. Is there anything else Im missing?
---
No PvP rewards at launch. BGs and pvp gear will be released with stage 2, alongside BWL. 
---
I loved vanilla because of the community. The game forced you to work together. That’s largely why I don’t play retail. It’s become a 1 player game. 
---
On progression they are going to go to people who are going to use them in raids unless you are the popular guy on your guild. Outside of progression you may have a better chance.
---
Also it depends what loot rules your guild
---
Is running, if it’s DKP they may let anyone roll on whatever they want, which is the kind of guild I will be looking for as I want a fat 2H for enhancement PvP but going to most likely end up healing raids.
---
Yeah, typing something will really prevent abuse...
---
Hunter is solid, and you can get some of the blue gear with that play schedule. The hunter blue pvp set might be the best blue pvp set of all the classes.
---
Consider pugging with a guild to be an application/trial.
---
People on trials shouldn’t be getting much loot over regulars anyway.
---
I directly replied to a comment comparing retail and classic.
---
Yeah that’s actually easy to prove too. Account creation date. Gotta set it sometime before bc though. Someone who started the day before bc obviously doesn’t count. I’d be down with that.
---
Because "meme" specs are bad...or something.
---
Can we skip cataclysm this time? Seeing Azeroth get wrecked sucked, Deathwing was a really stupid villain, and I doubt anybody would mourn the loss of Garrosh-as-warchief or SoO.
---
Hell, for that matter, can we fix TBC to not have Illidain and Kael’thas as villains?
---
&gt;Seems it's turned into a bit of a social version of Diablo where it's all about getting better gear. But for what purpose?
---
For me and the people I play with it's all about killing bosses. Or in some cases completing as high keys as possible in mythic+. Gear is just a means to an end. The guild is struggling a bit at the moment though, as we failed to clear all of mythic Uldir, got stuck for weeks on Zul, so people got tired of it by Christmas and either left or stopped playing. Mostly waiting for the new raid on the 23nd now, hopefully we can get a full team going then. 
---
The monastery was merely a setback.... 
---
The thing about druids is they are insanely good dueling if played right. Their mitigation, mobility, and heals make them the best class at outlasting people, and they can always get away and stealth to reset a fight. 
---
Their weakness is group pvp. Outlasting everyone isn't as useful when the extra burst and cc from other classes will make or break a fight
---
&gt; I think your denying the fact that bfa made a lot of people quit atm
---
How long have you been playing WoW? That has happened in every single expansion after Wrath. People have also claimed that WoW is dying since then, that's almost ten years. They still sold like at least 3 million copies of BfA, a not insignificant portion of those will come back with the next expansion unless they really fuck things up again. They might start to fuck things up repeatedly though, in which case, yeah, you might be right. But we really can't know if that will happen or not. 
---
I feel like the new added gear would be theorycrafted until we knew what was BiS. I love kara and I want its loot to mean something. 
---
It also has to do a lot with how you play the game. Purely anecdotal, but have been in 4 betas (non consecutive) and it was always only during a when I pushed gladiator in 3s or did high end raiding. The rationale I would assume being that higher tier players while not necessarily better by any means just are already willing to put in the work to min/max their characters, so the case should hopefully be the same in beta as far as how extensively they test as well. 
---
I feel like Blizzard is making Classic so that they can officially say they did it and C&amp;D the biggest private servers.
---
If they don't do this I'll be pretty surprised.
---
im going to wait a day or two to see what realms are populated. ive had a time where i started playing at launch and the realm was dead af months later.
---
That's some great input. I will definitely look into that Steve Jobs clip.
---
Of course we can't tell for sure how things are going to turn out. But I will add some speculations to the text as well.  
---
So it will be some kind of mixture between community studies and possible outcomes.
---
I appreciate your comment man, it's definitely a great topic to write about. Easy to get really into it as a fan.
---
&gt;  its pointless to continue a discussion with you.
---
This is unfortunately typical. Chant your mantra, and run away from discussion.
---
&gt;We are getting vanilla with the true authentic data
---
True authentic data and _Legion_ everything else, unless changes are made to make the Legion parts more like vanilla. 
---
Loot trading is not like vanilla. Sharding is not like vanilla. Dire Maul on day one is not like vanilla. Stepping into Molten Core for the first time with easy-mode "prepped for Burning Crusade" era itemization and increased loot drops is not like vanilla. 
---
It's baffling to me that so many people in the no changes crowd are so determined to have game play that's not like vanilla.
---
Why run kara if its loot is the same as naxx? 
---
If only more people looked at retail from this perspective
---
