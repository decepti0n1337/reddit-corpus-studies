Completely agree with the OCD!
---
---
---
I agree, 30-40 is the worst part of the game to me.  Huge zones with no mount and the zones that are reasonably good questing are gankfests.
---
Nice theory, but wrong. I have some inside information that says classic is released July 22nd.
---

---
(Family vacation reservations made and internet there is going to be le crap.)
---
Yeah that's my current plan, but was seeing if it was confirmed or not to adjust it.
---
Emerald Dream for sure
---
I don’t know I do consider myself very technical just not so much in wow. If you are familiar with dota then you would know meepo is a very technical hero same with invoker and they are to of my best heroes by I have problems with wow pet micro. Based on your advice I might go Sl nightfall or full destro and maybe respec later on. Thanks for the help 
---
Roll shaman first.  You can tank as you level and figure out if you would like to tank, you have healing to fall back on late game if you wish to focus as a healer.  shaman is great for pvp with instant casts and windfury
---
My old GM got very addicted to WoW. She was a hardcore raider and ate nothing but fast food. She didn't exercise and ended up gaining about 100 lbs (not exaggerating) and pretty much spent her life in front of a computer. Health started to become a problem but she didn't do anything about it. I had quit playing a couple years prior when we got the message. She had a heart attack and died while playing about a year ago. She took her gaming too far and did nothing to turn it around. I reinstalled just for our in game memorial for her. 
---
Was it as shit as everybody said it was? Well as I kid I was easily impressed. 
---
No they won't do it 24/7, but the strongest guild on the server will control most of the leather while the rest fight over the scraps.
---
Nice pixel
---
All the time, I’m jealous of people who can login daily and have a blast and just love it, I envy them.
---
I really do love my paladin from retail, but I just can't get over retail itself.
---
Im on the same boat. Sometimes I want to dps. But I think ill be a warrior or a priest and just fill an important roll to get dungees and dps when questing and pvp
---
Yes. 
---
They can tank the odd 5man but Warrior tank is always best
---
As a warrior in vanilla, first piece of plate gear. 
---
Honestly I've leveled a few warriors. They aren't that bad. Just a bit slower then others. Plus you can get easy dungeon groups if you tank and can choose whos in the group so you get the items you want
---
Will u help me find my dawgggg..
---
Well its an easy way to jump into a specific slot search. Once you are on the results you can add more or less filters to your hearts content. So yea. 
---
I still remember the first blue world drop I ever got. Zealot blade... I was a priest.
---
Shammy is nice with the free rez
---
There's nothing stopping you from saying that shit in /world. Witch hunts are a necessary evil to combat these assholes, and luckily, people do inform the world quite often of other people's behavior
---
(x) doubt
---
To this day in retail I will wait until the last millisecond on someone’s hearthstone/teleport and sap them.
---
Multiple times. 
---
source kids tho
---
Tusken Helm was on my hit-list for so long as a warrior. Once I got WW axe (did anyone ever choose the sword or mace?) you really felt like it was gonna be an easy grind till 40
---
This list is highly opinionated to my personal favorites. If you know any other useful item's feel free to tell me what they are! 
---
I think I am just super excited for the community aspect where your reputation with friends and guilds mattered. I had a crew of people that I rolled with and it was great. 
---
Guild raids
---
Pvp buddies. 
---
Knowing people!  Amazeballs 
---
I was looking at the PvP brawl dates for the rest of the year on retail today. 
---
The last Brawl listed ends on... July 16th.
---
It’s legit boys 
---
Awesome, thank you very much! :D
---
Yes.
---
It feels so good man
---
The problem with retail wow for me has always been tied to class design and how they somehow removed a lot of old tricks classes used to have, doesn't necessarily mean i only liked the vanilla design, but somewhere between tbc/wotlk was the best design-wise for wow IMO.
---
The only other issue I had outside class design was ease of access for everything, be it moving about in the world /porting everywhere or just super fast flying everywhere, it trivialized the world imo.
---
This legitimately makes me slam my fist into the disk and /s Are you fucking kidding me? GTFO of here ...
---
No. I don't want cancer.
---
First set bonus.  Doesn’t matter what it was.  
---
You think they're going to drop classic and a retail raid at the same time just to meet some wishful reading of a blue post and to intentionally aggravate and split the audience? 
---
Not really ... I've tried pretty much since Cataclysm to try and enjoy the game as much as I did with the previous iterations of the game, with brief spikes of enjoyment in MoP and Legion but those periods only ever lasted a month or two. WoD really put the nail in the coffin for me.
---
&gt; doesn't necessarily mean i only liked the vanilla design, but somewhere between tbc/wotlk was the best design-wise for wow IMO.
---
Agree 100%
---
&gt; The only other issue I had outside class design was ease of access for everything, be it moving about in the world /porting everywhere or just super fast flying everywhere, it trivialized the world imo.
---
If the class design was somewhat decent though, I could probably live with this.
---
Wow, thank you. Thats a lot of details :D Imma surely check up on that guide too
---
Killed an elite quest mob with an alliance guy using /e to talk. Stuck around and killed the elite for his completion too. 
---
Druid tanks are great in MC once your guild has AQ40 on farm 
---
We don’t deserve /e after some of these posts on r/creepyasterisks I’ve seen 
---
&gt; Zboard Merc
---
Merc Stealth was lord of all keyboards. Worth some money, too. Steelseries even did an April fools joke last year saying they would bring it back. Turned out to just be a contest for 3 of them that were found in a closet somewhere.
---
I missed too much plot and there’s no way to catch up because every expansion concludes in a raid that no one queues for anymore.  
---
Imagine waking up to just see this staring back at you:
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)‎

Warrior claim to tanks but they have tiny health. Beer has biggest health in game. People STILL don't understand.
---
Sad

Go by what you want to do most of the time. 
---
The video had plenty of content, it wasn't even just about the guides, title of this post could have been made better but I don't see the problem with someone promoting an informative/fun youtube channel. I like to learn by videos and reading posts, if this wasn't here I wouldn't have ever seen his channel. If it isn't something you like that doesn't mean others wont like it...
---
Any class with 8+ level advantage on you will beat you regardless of skill, unless you're absolutely twinked out but even then you might not win depending on how good the opponent is.
---
Also any class that severely outgears you at 60, say like two tiers and above , will win so long as they have a semi functional spec for pvp and know the fundamentals , this includes healers and tanks btw, although in very few cases and overwhelming skill advantage to the undergeared person can sometimes win, but very rarely so.
---
Same gear/lvl pvp is an entirely different story though.
---
but is it a 'classic summer' if it's 70% classicless?
---
Try them all out. No shame in blowing 10 hours making sure you made the right choice. 
---
hahaha
---
fucking loved that guy
---
Downvoting because I am right?  Kk
---
And yet npc beasts can. 
---
As someone that has leveled the majority of classes to 60 ( at one point or another) on non official servers, I honestly tell you it doesn't matter much, all classes are good, advantages/disadvantages for any class can be covered by clever use of professions/items/gear and obviously skill, so pick whatever comes to mind and go with it.
---
/poke
---
Exactly, you basically just learn the pulls from someone who has already done it or you go into a consequence free PTR or in my case you do both
---

---
Beer has no health once you drink it.
---
Spells below level 20
---
Casting a spell that is below level 20 incurs a significant penalty to the coefficient of the spell. The formula for this is:
---
     (20 - [Spell Level]) * .0375 = [Penalty]
---
Downranking
---
Downranking also has significant effects on the spell's coefficient. The forumla for this is:
---
  ([Level of next rank - 1] + 5) / [Character Level] = [Downranking Coefficient]
---
This is no longer the case with 1.12, in my current raiding guild on a non official server we have 2 shadow priests who raid as shadow ( no joke) , you are required to go the extra mile with consumables though but generally you will roll on caster offpieces and weapons just like locks /mages.
---
My guild isn't a casual guild either, we've fully cleared AQ 40 and everything prior to that ( naxx coming out soon ).
---
Write out the 8 items ya clickbaiter.
---
Man it depends on the patch.  With it being 1.12 I'm not sure. 
---
For most of vanilla it was shamans, because they have an off-GCD slow, self-healing, high damage, and can occasionally self-rez for the "you only thought you won!" moment.  Not positive they're the kings of 1.12, although they're certainly not going to be *bad* or anything.
---
Yep! They sure do!! ;-)
---
Didn't all ranks of offensive spells like frostbolt scale fully if they were the same cast time as the highest rank?
---
I give it a try every expansion but couple of levels in I begin to miss the way it used to feel, not just classic but; vanilla, tbc, wotlk - i miss having fun in this game
---
Exactly what I was looking for, thanks so much.
---
As a person that has played a shaman I'd say tanking on a shaman will not be very meta, you can tank some dungeons early on but the higher you go the less likely you'll be able to tank much.
---
I'm quite the opposite. I've been inspired to make rogues, warlocks, paladins, but every time I always go back to my Warrior. Until I lost my account in WoD and "resurrected" my warrior as a death knight of the same name. Becoming a blood DK. So, naturally, ill be playing a 2H fury warrior... Even if I "plan" for something else.
---
If it makes you feel better I'm gonna fuck around hard.
---
People shit on all sorts of specs and combos here but the best some of the best people in the best guilds had the ability to make unorthodox builds work. 
---
Oh fuck he's good
---
Warriors are starting to tank dual wield fury for threat, just to keep up with druids. where the fuck have you been noob.
---
I’ve been playing WoW since vanilla, and I play retail to this day. I’ve had my breaks for sure, but I always come back. Some of the hate for BfA is warranted but I’d say overall it’s blown way out proportion. 
---
Classic and retail are VERY different games, but both have their strengths and weaknesses. 
---
I am super super super super excited about Classic though! I imagine it’ll take over the majority of my retail playing time, although I might try to continue to play retail during Classic, even if it’s just to keep up with the story. 
---
I believe that is exactly what I just said lol.
---
We'll see.  I'd like to think the attitude of the Classic community will be more like Vanilla than the cutthroat bullying Private Server experience.
---
this dude is light years ahead... wood flooring, camera, 2 pairs of glasses...

Listen here, Mouse...

This right here. I had a few leftover from wrath and I found the same thing

Out of my whole mount collection, I miss my Zhevra the most. :'(

[removed]
---
There was a hunter guild leader on my server who ran the best alliance guild. They cleared everything first, but he got first dibs on all loot. There was something so douchy about seeing a hunter running around with Ashkandi long before BWL was on farm.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Personally, I remember helping my friend quest constantly to help him catch up to me, only to have him never help me once after he outleveled me... Those moments show people's real character hah
---
It'd be much more usable if it let you pick stats instead of class/spec. 
---
Each expansion had its own story that was pretty much separate from each other. The exception is right now. The ending of Legion kicked off the start of the BfA storyline. 
---
If you were to have a max level character, you can solo most of the old raids if you really wanted to experience the story of it. You can even still queue for LFR of Legion raids if you want 
---
Forgive me, I forgot to ask your permission to talk about the games I enjoy.
---
It was a lapse of judgement and I'll do better to remember in future. Please try not to be too upset.
---
" Druid can't really do anything great at the highest level " you are very mistaken friend, this old vanilla mentality developed prior to 1.12 when druids weren't great, but they're so strong with 1.12.
---
In my raiding guild on a non official server we have a feral off tank in AQ 40, yes he off tanks some bosses and a lot of trash packs, he flexes to cat dps when he's not tanking.
---
Also our resto druids are always in the upper meters of HPS .
---
And as for pvp I'm just gonna leave these for your viewing pleasure:

It’s funny you mention the portals because retail just removed a bunch of portals for that very reason and a lot of people lost their shit over it lol 
---
Omg I identify with the "work shits taking longer".
---
So pumped.
---
It is known. 
---
Depends.
---
They're modifying the current tick / batching processes of current builds to put spells on a lower tier to mimic OG spell batching, and have mentioned they're going to adjust current macro system to better represent how it was in the past (while eliminating macro exploits from vanilla)
---
I'd put money down that /castsequence won't be a thing, since it wasn't a thing.
---
My favorite were the paladins guarding a flag that kept casting max rank consecration and ran themselves out of mana. Then they’d stop to drink and of course that’s when you jump them.
---
Pick hunter for PvP they are really good in open world and BGs, their PvE is fine but only 2 raid spots are open for Hunter usually, Hunter can farm DM:N and Mara really easy and make a lot gold, obviously you can just make gold just through professions like anyone else, Hunter skill ceiling is through the roof, one of the highest this is true for most classes though.
---
The only easy time Hunter has is leveling up, anyone calling you a Huntard is a moron and not worth your time.
---
Hey man if he let him get away with it, other people would have started to push him over
---
Clearly you've never felt the power of wielding a Thunderfury. 
---
I just can't get over the constant, cynical ego stroking. The last time I tried doing relevant content, in WoD, some NPC told me how incredibly awesome and inspirational I was - just after I'd died pathetically, twice, in a pathetic quest. I logged off and couldn't muster the will to play again.
---
That, and the effective gear resets every major patch. It kills the reason to put in any real effort; feels like it's just about keeping up with the Joneses.
---
Last but not least, LFG/LFR. It crushes the single biggest practical reason for building relationships in-game, and turns dungeons and raids from challenges into chores.
---
The rest of the frustrating things, like class homogeneization and questionable lore... it's probably possible to put up with them. But those three are deal breakers. Can't possibly like modern WoW as long as they are there, no matter how hard I try.
---
I'm running an alliance guild West coast pvp sat/sun raid times noon to 4 if you are interested we can talk more!

When I was sick with lymphoma I had that kind of setup.  Boss let me work from home, what normally took a full 8 hour day to do at the office I suddenly found I could compress into about 3 hours and spend the remainder playing Skyrim/taking naps depending on how recently my last chemo treatment was.

Not gonna lie, chemo fucking sucked, but working from home was awesome.

We expect all members to be well prepared before raids with knowledge of the strats we’re going to use, as well as full consumes and world buffs. All this information will be posted well in advance for each class and role. 
---
Members will be expected to be helpful where possible and respectful to the rest of the guild, if we all work together we will be able to achieve much more, much quicker. 
---
We believe faction pride and PvP is an important part of Vanilla. As well as our achievements as a guild &lt;Earthsinger&gt; will strive to work with other horde guilds to secure faction dominance on the server. A friendly relationship between active Horde guilds on the OCE-PvP server will ensure we have a healthy and thriving community. 
---
Socials are welcome, having a small community of socials and friends improves the guild atmosphere. Socials will all be expected to be kind and respectful to ALL players on our faction as your actions will reflect upon the entire guild.   
---
Any questions don’t hesitate to contact me on Discord @Polyrhythm#5944
---
&gt; Dungeon finding - in retail, if you wanna run a dungeon, you can be grouped up in minutes.
---
This is not a positive. The way that the premade group finder works now is how the dungeon finder should have worked at introduction.
---
Moonkin is tier 1 erp material, bear falls somewhere between female dwarf and catform
---
It does not have to be an all or nothing situation.
---
Your question assumes that EVERYONE hates Live WOW. Thats not completely true. 
---
There are parts of BFA I loved. But I am not playing any more and more excited to go back to Classic. 
---
But you can do both.
---
Calling things cancer only sets up this 2 camps thing. Which does not help the community.
---
I have in diablo ;)
---
Could also use reflectors to counter pom pyro if you're quick enough.
---
After our guild finally finished the process to help our tank get the first Thunderfury he quit the guild to join a rival guild.
---
Free Action Potion = dead mage.
---
Yes, it is hilarious when it works. Also an easy way to tell who pvp’s without spell alert mods. 
---
Very cool 😎 
---
Roll dice 
---
This. You are my spirit connected human. I have such a hard time with the same things you stated in the original post, and these are my top three as well...in fact, I’ve already kinda of decided to try and pick three classes to start with. One to main when I play solo, one to level with a friend, and a single alt when I’m not feeling the main.
---
That functionality is already there. This page is just an quick start jumping off spot and will also be good for new players.
---
Totally read that in a Russian accent.
---
Tl;DR: Level 20 and up have legit spell coefficients. Don't downrank 1-19.
---
No. It all went downhill when they introduced Pandas. 
---
Druid tanks are actually fine though, not in all fights but in a fair few
---
“A trickster”
---
That’s a nice way of putting it. 
---
I’d do the same but on a max level rogue. I wouldn’t just gank either. I would regularly sap people while they drink/eat, or if they are fishing. I loved to distract people off bridges. 
---
The best though? Definitely using a bow to tag mobs right before they attack. 
---
The main thing I hate about LFR, is that it "trains" you for the real raid. And it also can become a requirement to get gear fast.
---
 I also don't like how small raids are encouraged in the new system I mean, who is going to go through the trouble to get 25 people when they can just as easily make it with 10. You have to give people an incentive)
---
I don't mind casuals being given a chance to see raid content, but LFR needs to be released near the end of a raid's lifetime, to be more of a special event than the main course.
---
Ranged DPS....PvE....Ele Shaman....
---
*cries in totem*
---
Yeah but to be fair a few portals mean nothing when people barely move much, everyone has 3 HS' , instantly teleporting to dungeons/raids/arena/ any endgame really, plus too many flightpaths everywhere + flight time reduced so you literally bounce from A to B without having to walk much this means less time on the ground ( not even gonna mention flying mounts).
---
poopsock it?
---
That's a new one I haven't heard before
---
You might actually start having fun again, there's that.
---
My apologies, didn't mean to make it seem click baitey. Will write out my whole list next time I plan on posting something similar. 
---
I remember a mage in out guild making portals for people after the raid. Problem was he'd start Darnassus, then Stormwind, then Ironforge. The portals were stacked, and it was completely random which city you went to when you clicked it.
---
ya twin emps, maybe 20 warlocks on the entire server tank that fight.
---
Generally speaking a good Hunter almost always has the upper hand in a 1v1. They're also strong 1vx so Hunters are definitely a top tier PvP class. One of the biggest upsides is that they're always useful regardless of what type of PvP you're doing whether that's solo queue bgs, premade bgs, world PvP or raid vs. raid.
---
In terms of skill ceiling Hunter is one of the highest in the game both in PvP and PvE. There's a huge difference between someone who's a decent Hunter and someone who's a legitimately good Hunter. It can be almost impossible to get up close to them if they know what they're doing.
---
If you are willing to tank, you will never have to wonder, "No idea if it will be needed". Everyone and their fucking mother is addicted to seeing big crits, killing people, and topping the dps charts. Thing is, they need *gear* to do it, and that gear is primarily located in instances...
---
It's not for everyone, but for those willing to tank, you and the healer are the heroes who allow everyone else to do what they love to do. There is a low supply of protection warriors tanking, therefore, there is a high demand for protection warriors tanking. The protection warrior is *the* PvE tank for World of Warcraft: Classic in the eyes of most.
---
Siege of Orgrimmar was really fun though. And the spellbooks weren't yet fully pruned.
---
Healer..... Horde, so I’ve eliminated the Paladin.
---
I’m leaning to Priest mainly, but Shaman still a potential pick. 
---
I think I’ll be passing on a Druid, as I will want rez. 
---
Any recommendations others have? Priest or shaman for healer?
---
It's so funny that this is where we are now, given that WoW was criticized during Vanilla for being too hand-holdy and theme-parky by the Everquest and MUD veterans.
---
I think that's just condescending. Blizzard knows more about how to launch an mmo than you do. 
---
I feel like a significant amount of people only gonna play classic for this very purpose Not that its bad, I personally enjoy that too :P
---
Completing content used to stand for something. 
---
Now it’s just a free handout with no skill required 
---
But moonkin don't even have opposable thumbs!
---
I usually just skip those quests. I think the default respawn timer is 5min, so unless Blizz changes that then it's xp loss sitting around.
---
im actually torn for what i want to play, i played lock in vanilla and loved it but i dont think ill play it again.
---
id do holy paladin because i loved paladin healing in later expansions  ut doing all the buffing for 40 people seems pretty annoying and im prob going to go horde this time around anyway.
---
i also like tanking and grinding but i hear warriors are not too great to grind on.
---
currently been playing around with a troll mage on a server because leveling a warrior is a bit annoying.
---
so lol even people who played vanilla can not be sure.
---
chances are ill end up leveling 2 or possibly even 3 characters if they dont fuck u0 cpassic. think ill end up going mage first for gold farming fun
---
The items are (in order of easiest to most difficult to obtain);
---
Azure Silk Belt: Passive swim speed increase.
---
Swift Boots: 15 second 40% movement speed increase on an hour cooldown. 
---
Hydrocane: Staff that gives the wearer underwater breathing.
---
Electromagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator: Shoots lightning in a very large cone (super useful for pulling lots of mobs).
---
Nifty Stopwatch: 10 second 40% movement speed increase on a 30 minute cooldown.
---
Skull of Impending Doom: 60% movement speed on a 5 minute cooldown at the cost of health and mana.
---
Olaf's All Purpose Shield: Slowfall shield, also included is Noggenfogger since so few can use shields.
---
Linkens Boomerang: Ranged, almost instant, attack for all classes. 
---
Muthafucking dworf worrior master race
---
I was thinking Jim Carey, actually...
---
Good shit. My comment was purely anecdotal and based on my own experiences dueling druids.  
---
Glad someone can be arsed to find the hard facts for us less educated. (or more lazy maybe?) +1.
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Are you speaking for me now? I never said nor did I think I was going to be either one of those in a week.
---
Why are you so aggressive? 
---
yeah unfortunately most developers like to chase the carrot on a stick and end up forsaking the identity of their game to chase current trends.  WoW was never meant to be the type of instant gratification game model that we see in MOBAs and BRs.  Hopefully Classic can help show Blizz what they are missing in the current IP.
---
Well by that then we should all stop suggesting things full stop.
---
In all seriousness, a Tarren Mill v Southshore stress test was just something I thought would be fun. Nothing more. 
---
You bring up a good point there. I fear that, when Classic launches, there will be two vocal groups between the two games. Classic players who despise everything retail stands for, and retail players who think Classic is a huge step backwards. This would just brew more resentments and tear everyone apart.
---
My hope is that this doesn’t happen, and that both communities can come to appreciate (or, at the very least, ignore) each other and love WoW equally for their own reasons.
---
Haha yeah true.  I was streaming early and was staring like a slack jawed idiot at some reddit threads while people entered and left the stream.. feelsbadman
---
money + auction house = win every fight regardless of class.
---
My hopes as well my friend. 
---
When we can unite, or at least try to get along, the game as a whole will benefit.
---
Or when you are 0,1 sec away from finishing this herb gathering cast and a snowball hits you out of nowhere.
---
One of the reasons why vanilla or Classic in this case is amazing, the fact you have (and I) trouble choosing what to play just means, that every single class is unique and has something to bring to the table.
---
Since vanilla / classic isnt homogenized like current wow, the balance is something other than making dps meters about the same. If your class lacks dps, it might bring something other than damage, like utility, buffs etc. One of the reasons I prefer the past.
---
It depends on the encounter. There are lots of encounters where rolling rejuvenation can be helpful due to periodic damage, particularly on classes that aren’t taking too much damage but are being worn down. Max rank regrowth and HT can be timed on MT’s and letting a max regrowth roll can be great for swiftmend.
---
Druid is really fun to heal as. Every class relies on a few consistent spells, but Druid brings an AoE heal, battle Rez, innervate etc. Also, there are a few fights where you use some of your other utility like sleeps and decursive skills. 
---
A lot of people crap on regrowth but with the +50% crit skill a lot of its mana inefficiency is dissipated, especially with lower ranks of the spell.
---
I played vanilla. Did warrior first to 60, druid second, mage third, then a bunch of lowbie alts/twinks.
---
In retrospect, here is what I personally plan to do.
---
Warrior made a poor first choice, I feel. Taking hits while giving out hits, having to sit down to eat, spending gold on food/repairs, very weapon dependent, etc.

Instead, I will personally main a frost mage *first*, with tailoring/enchanting. The frost mage is capable of AoE farming like no other, creates their own food, isn't as gear-dependent as the warrior, has portals between cities, and the Blink spell allows bursts of movement pre-mount. Making gold is efficient with AoE farming, but aside from simply gold, this will allow me to start collecting a small pile of melee weapons to set aside for my warrior to follow. Not only that, but enchanting as a profession will allow me to put stamina on their armor and maybe Fiery enchant on their weapon, making an otherwise slow leveling class *that* much faster. Can even have a friend pass my mage food on over to my warrior so I don't have to pay for food. 
---
^^ What I'm illustrating here is that your first 60 is the most important choice, because, given the right class and professions, it can set you up for success with the next one, and so on, and so on. Your first class, I'd argue, should be a top damage-per-second class, because rolling a healer first isn't going to give you the efficient solo world farming that a D.p.S. class would. 
---
Lastly, given your preferences, I would ditch the warrior being first for sure, *maybe* ditch the shaman being second, and do priest first. Shadow priest can get decent farming kills, and can also get a heal set to re-spec into. Heal set will make you highly desirable in PvE, while still giving you okay farm when solo so you're not useless. Pick whatever profession you feel will make leveling the warrior or shaman next easiest. Is it enchanting for a cheap-ish Fiery weapon for faster kill time? Is it alchemy for stacks on stacks of health potions? Whatever it is, think on it, and always be thinking ONE step AHEAD about synergy and efficiency with the next class.
---
Either are good and will get you invited along to raids. Their techniques as healers differ. I don't know shaman really well, but I can tell you that they mostly buff via their many, many totems and then just spam chain heal. So they are a little easier in terms of rotation and spell choice (you usually know which totems you'll be placing prior to a fight). Priests have fewer buffs, but more spell options, so you have more decisions to make on the fly. Shaman raid heal, priests generally single-target heal. Shaman have more utility, fewer options. Priests are the opposite. Which appeals to you?
---
In dungeons, the options are the same. With the shaman totem utility, I would guess you'd be pretty likely to give a little boost to dungeon clearing times (lots of melee DPS will definitely get a boost from WF totem, for example). Priests are really good with mana regen, so it's easier to recover if you get adds. But that's rarely an issue.
---
I suppose there are other things to consider as well. If you want to do some farming, shaman have really strong burst DPS whereas priests have Holy Nova and can do some good AOE farming. The leveling process is similar, though priests tend to be a little more efficient because they regen mana better. Off-spec is comparable if you want to switch to DPS at high end: shadow priests buff warlock damage so there is reason to bring one to raids and enhancement shaman bring solid DPS and the shaman utility. Elemental shaman are not optimal, but can definitely fill a spot if you're in a guild that isn't pushing new content.
---
OP has posted some nsfw content
---
Actual top 5
---
dylon dylon dylon dylon dylon
---
I chose shaman mainly cause I like the class fantasy a lot more, and cause I actually like totems. I think they break up the monotony of _just_ healing, which can be a little too whack-a-mole sometimes, and they allow you to contribute to your group in a whole other way.
---
do you work at Blizz?
---
You can tank by BWL but there is certainly a shit load of strong gear in AQ40/20 that make it easier. Having Malfurions Blessed Bulwark, PvP gear, Dragonhide shoulder pads, and one or two rings/trinkets is good enough.
---
The really good AQ gear is the helmet in AQ40 and the boots in AQ20. Otherwise a lot of the really significant gear you’ll have before then.
---
Hows their mana situation/dps on long fights
---
lul. hunters and mages stand no chance against spriests. warlock and ele shaman are your only real counters. rogues can be ass too. but i played troll so rogues arent that bad.
---
they are great for any content!
---
...except current raidtier
---
End game raiding was essentially spamming chainheal and cycling totems? 
---
I did a shaman in BC and I loved spamming chainheal. 
---
Have you not read the main pro-sharding argument? Are you serious?! Lmao The main argument is literally if we shard at the beginning it will A)Provide more server stability after a tourist mass exodus takes places B) Potentially make the launch “smoother” and retain more of said tourists. Both are an attempt to deal with or prevent. 
---
The problem is that those figure don’t actually prove anything. There is simply too much info not given. A Pserver with a fraction of the Classic audience playing, and a statement that doesn’t include all the info you need to draw a conclusion on anything. I’ll say it again and again. Sharding isnt the answer.
---
If you want to be impossible to kill in pvp just play a pve server, soul link warlocks aren't real players.
---
Biggest dick move I witnessed was probably by moi: I monopolized AB for 2 months or so with my premade to farm for my 1st and my brother's 2nd HW. Alliance naturally got pissed and organized a premade to gank me to 'teach me a lesson'. We were always outside AB's portal (don't recall why), but they found out. Allies showed up outside AB -&gt; started brawling -&gt; focused on me -&gt; 'enter BG' button appeared -&gt; I popped into AB -&gt; denied their gank -&gt; I was very pleased.
---
They got back at me though. Kind of. But it was weeks later, when I was in my last week and my HW was already a guarantee. They retook their monopoly, but it required a combination of the best Ally PvE guild on server (were in AQ gear), and the best Ally PvP guild (were lots of R12s R13s and R14s), while we were in our humble MC and BWL gear. Not to mention that they probably used voice chat, and we just had me spamming commands in caps in chat. So we were still better.
---
crap. shaman can tank any 5 man content just fine. my buddy always tanked our tribute buffruns in ele spec.
---
I'm in a similar boat. As soon as I decided to play Classic, I figured I'd remake my original two characters: holy priest and feral druid. But since I've been obsessively watching videos and reading this sub, I think I have switched to holy priest and elemental shaman. But I can't decide between them, so I'll probably end up basically co-leveling them depending on my mood when I sit down to play.
---
You mentioned you like tanking. Feral druids are less painful to level than warriors even if they don't tank quite as well end-game. Feral tanks are still perfectly viable and feral cats are definitely good at doing some grinding. Not as good at farming as mages, but they can stealth and then turn into hard-hitting tanks which can open up some options for your grinding.
---
op literally said there are things that are cool and interesting in their post.  they even said "for *me*" the bad things are too bad to be able to enjoy the good things.
---
they shared their opinion, and it actually seems to align pretty well with yours; why do you think they believe retail is cancer and everyone hates it?
---
Druid and Rogue play the same role in PvP, but on opposite ends. Rogues are offensive stealthers (kill with burst, then Vanish) while Druids are the defensive stealthers (outlast opponents, then run away if things go wrong).
---
I like the Druid better. They are much stronger in world PvP. They're a lot more dependent on gear though. You can't really play like a Druid until you get either the PvP set or the Dungeon 2 set, both of which have stamina, intellect, strength, agility, spell damage, and bonus healing on every piece. Gear with that kind of stat spread allows you to adapt - cast spells, heal, or shift into forms depending on what fits the situation in front of you.
---
On the other hand, Rogue damage depends a lot on their weapons, but their playstyle doesn't really change from blues to epics. They just hit harder as they get better gear.
---
God thing hunters are good at farming ;)
---
Holy shit, y'all ran the Dark Brotherhood. That sounds like a lot of fun!
---
"No chance" with a 41 yard range and Viper Sting? I know in reality it doesn't always work perfectly, but a hunter could theorically OOM a spriest without taking a single hit and there's not much the priest can do about it, outside of engi/consumables anyway - but then a hunter could use those too. 
---
I still have a few if anyone wants
---
Idk how this would be click bait, he didnt say
---
"You WON'T BELIEVE these AMAZING 8 items!"
---
What gives? 
---
Makes ya wonder 😏
---
Oh my god, there are *hundreds* of hours of content.  Now I'm sad my commute is only like 20 minutes.
---
Sorry. The cancer remark was not aimed at the OP but something else posted in the thread as well as a few other posts of late here and including the official classic forums.
---
Sorry for the confusion there. 
---
Thank you for this comment. I want to be a min/maxxer but since I have a family and kids now, I’ll have to casually be hardcore.
---
Which is best for wanting to get into groups for raids at end game content with mediocre gear? Or will both be welcomed?
---
Yessir. But there was also this whole element of positioning to it that wasn't really there with other (single-target) healers.
---
Instead of focusing on just one player, you have to target different players and move around for your Chain Heal to bounce how you want it to. You also have to drop your totems within the radius of the players that need it most (e.g. Windfury for melee).

---
I also asked another question here, I’d love your thoughts on that as well 
---
I feel this so hard. I thought I was set on Mage but my gut wants me to play a Priest instead as I love being of use and being helpful. Sure, Mage can do that too but Healers are on another level of usefulness. The only issue is that I've never healed before in Vanilla but I could learn. Then there's the issue with PvP. I'll solo level and on top of that I love scoring kills in PvP so maybe a healer wouldn't be right after all? Respeccing is an option I suppose but I want to raid every week so that would cost so much... oh the agony!
---
I hope I got it figured out by the time a date is announced. At least I know I'll be an Undead Female. I hope you can settle on a class aswell!
---
Hm. That I can't really answer, unfortunately. I think you'll probably need to spend a little time trying to get your dungeon set and either priest or shaman in tier 0.5 gear will be welcomed along to the early raids. 
---
God bless this TLDW
---
My earliest gear memory would be leveling in Duskwood on my first toon (mage) in '05/'06 and by shear chance my shoulders matched my robe. both white with a little gold trim.
---
I think it would have been my first screen shot, and I'm sure it was my wall paper on my win2000 1.3ghz celeron PC, but that hard drive is long dead
---
If anyone knows what robe and shoulders they might have been let me know, My warlock is going to need them in a few months.
---
i think ill go war if i tank , i prefer the more simple classes and not needing to re spec all the time.
---
with druid ill prob end up healing because i like healing then like i will always have shitty damage and tank gear.
---
i guess the ideal for me would be a holy paladin and either a mage / war or even rogue dps. im going horde so the paladin is essentially out unless i change my mind. i also pvped a lot during vanilla.
---
lol i guess i want to be able to do everything so i dont know what to pick.
---
i think warrior will be crazy popular in vanilla so even though i really love the idea of being able to war tank and dps id say tanks and melee dps will be in least demand.
---
i need to play around on my pserver or one of the insta 60 servers a bit, i should be able to tell how much ill like war and mage at 60 pretty easy and go from there
---
You forgot that sweet ass Minor Beast Slayer enchant for the weapon glow
---
Shaman fell off the longer vanilla went on. They didn't get the gear benefit other classes did. They won't be bad at all but they plateau a bit as other classes take off.
---
Too class regardless imo. 
---
It's pretty shit, they mostly just use mindflay to proc shadow debuff , no room for dots really. 
---
But on rare occasions they can shield/off heal if any disaster occurs , they're mostly there for the debuff and utility.
---
THE most informative and methodical content creators right now are to me MadSeasonShow and Frostadamus. If you want to get hype without feeling like a shitty car salesman is yelling at you, try either of those channels, because I find them a joy to listen to. Hell, MadSeasonShow released an 11-minute video about people being on both sides of the nostalgia fence an hour ago, because he noticed a lot of people who aren't sold on Classic quoting the reason as some variant of "You're just letting your nostalgia glasses muddle your perspective..."  Hah.
---
yeah cool theorycrafting. in reality hunters just die.
---
But definitely dont go prot until endgame or you will never get there
---
I made the switch to esdf a few weeks ago. It was so hard at first. I had to remind some abilities and I used little patches of medical tape and put them on these 4 keys for training my habits. I have so much more room for binds now. But I am still getting used to it 3 weeks later. 
---
I will be farming for a precisely calibrated boomstick just to have a machinegun with rapid fire
---
you're overestimating 5mans
---
The same can be said about the hunter, if the hunter is good enough he will feign the sheep then scatter and viper sting/rocket boots outside the mage's range forcing the mage to blink just to get in range to cast, nowhere near the hunter's dead zone, once blink is used the hunter can dip in and out of range while slowling mage/viper sting on until the mage goes oom or dies before then.
---
It can go either way since it's a skill match up but consumables do play a big part of it.
---
What so you use?
---
i loved whack a mole healing in bc and wrath so much on a paladin lol i just hear how much buffing they need to do and i dont think the same sort of 1 click addon pladins use in vanilla servers will work with modern wows addon system
---
this is funny but i still remember seeing a pladin in zg facing a wall throwing huge heals thinking shit that looks pretty badass , only got to try it later expansions and loved it a lot. but like when i was healing on a paladin i never really liked to quest on them or grind for that matter. 
---
i doubt ill go aliance this time around but if i did my paladin would be my first alt , dont think id main just because yeah all i want to do is heal on it
---
I work as a caretaker for a mentally disabled man. So I help him live as normal of a life as he can. I make 14 an hour, but get an extra $1.50 an hour on weekends and I get paid 1.5x for my OT. I'm up in northern Minnesota and houses can be bought for 100k here, So It's honestly reasonable pay. Normally, it was me and another staff that split 40 hours with him, but the other staff had a brain aneurysm (he lived, thankfully), so he can't work anymore. Winters are super harsh up here, so the job market dies down during the winter (we hit -65f windchill during the polar vortex). Because of that, we haven't found another good staff for my client, yet, as he's violent and standoffish, so he's difficult to find staff for, as they need to be big, strong, intelligent, and calm. Duluth is a pretty big college town, So the hope is that we get some capable students from the college that need a summer gig, and then I can use them to get some time off. So, the gist of it is that I am responsible for a very difficult (but sweet) person's life, so sometimes you just gotta man up and deal with the shitty situations :D.
---
&gt;Knowing people!
---
This is the #1 draw, for me. I played almost until the end of WotLK, and I didn't even realize why I was slowly losing my perspective until I heard someone complain aloud that LFG Dungeon was removing accountability to be decent, because ninjas, rage-quitters, and general sociopaths weren't as traceable, so blacklisting was exponentially less effective. Conversely, being as benevolent, philanthropic, and altruistic as one can be was likewise less traceable. 
---
Villains only get boo'd and heroes only get cheered so long as everyone in our collective story is on the same page of the book at the same time. Sharding and LFG auto-queue throw accountability into disarray.
---
I can't stress enough how much I truly LOVE teaching people about World of Warcraft. Even if it's mundane stuff like how to reply to whispers or why some weapons glow a majestic blue or red. I remember with clear lucidity myself wondering those same things and if I can sort of push those people closer to discovering the magic that is this game a little more then that makes my entire day. I wish I could be a WoW professor.
---
4. It's shaman. Everyone goes Shaman one day.
---
All true, but shared values are right up there in the most important factors for relationships. It would be one thing to start dating someone and then 2 weeks later they drop a 'it's your 8h/day WoW habit or me' then fine, more power to them - see ya, controlling partner! 
---
But if, in the intervening years between vanilla and today, a person has gotten into a long term relationship with certain expected parameters and all of a sudden ducks out of that to spend 30 hours/week playing WoW, then any concerns would be totally legit.
---
We had Druid off tank patchwork just fineeeee
---
How about BoP items like the hand of ragnaros?
---
RIP in peace to people with metered bandwidth lol
---
I mean apparently I’m an outlier but my main from vanilla through cataclysm was a gnome warlock and I loved it. I thought he looked like a cool little maniacal satanist. There’s a certain silliness to it but I liked the gnomish lore and aesthetic especially with engineering goggles.
---
PLEASE BLIZZARD. DO STUFF LIKE THIS AGAIN. It may have been frustrating, but damn it was so EPIC.
---
I'm almost ashamed to say my 13 year old self almost got my mom to purchase me this keyboard for my birthday. 
---
&gt;But definitely dont go prot until endgame or you will never get there
---
Fair point. In WotLK, I could simply spam LFG auto-queue dungeons from levels 20-80 as a tank or healer. In Classic, having to manually zone in means needing to traverse the landscape, fighting MoBs or opposite faction members along the way. Know that spec'ing prot and trying to level solely through instances will be exponentially slower in Classic than in later expansions. 
---
You'll probably want to go Arms with a two-hander while leveling so you have good solo damage-per-second output. Fury dual-wielding is too unreliable on hit rating while leveling when compared with Arms and a 2h weapon.
---
I don't know why ppl downvote you. I love it hahaha
---
*laughs in every other melee* 
---
So every class sucks and he's bad? That was my point. You made it thank you.
---
Do they still do the levels granted thing in live WOW? 
---
I plan on being a min/maxer. Rushing to 60 with my buddies, smashing through content with an old guild of ours.
---
That said, I have every intention of becoming friends with all my fellow hordies. It’s been too long waiting for this game to be salty about players rusty skills. We finally got what we wanted and it’s gonna be a blast. I hope to help out as many newbies I can along the way and make our server the envy of others. It’s gonna be great having a living community again and even though there is a lot of shit talk on here, I think once the wait is over everyone is gonna come to their senses
---
I will say that of the healers, priest feels like it has the biggest and most "full" tool kit. Different types of healing spells for different situations, etc. 
---
Only a small percentage of players fully cleared Naxx during vanilla. I'm willing to eat my own words in saying that no new content is ever going to be put forth for classic servers.
---
And you know what? That's fine.
---
We want classic servers to play the old WoW, not an alternate timeline WoW. When you've cleared every raid, done it on tons of alts, and effectively "finished" the game, what's so bad about that? People who've had their fill will move on, and because it's attached to live WoW's subscription, it'll always have people who want to check it out because it's part of the package.
---
I don't know the whole story but remember that our rogue in the guild got his Thunderfurry completed and than all the sudden was in the best guild on the server for our faction. 
---
Onyx? Xerethil?
---
Both of those specs will have laughable DPS. You really need a deep Feral build with 14 points in the Balance tree if you want to function as a damage dealer on a Vanilla Druid.
---
That said: If you go Moonglow, then you are limiting yourself to healing. HotW + Nature's Swiftness can tank or heal. If you want to play more than one role, then HotW + NS is the only choice.
---
T0.5 won't be available until a later content patch. Your best bet for gearing is dungeon blues, check a pre-raid BiS guide.
---
This post is purely sarcastic\* (I'm upset I have to type that) 
---
Anytime I see a hunter I think to myself, "what an idiot". Every hunter is clueless, and has an inflated ego because they can kite (not difficult idiot). They think they need gear, WRONG. They think they need to do dungeons while leveling, WRONG. Get out of my dungeon groups. Yes, shamans need agility gear as well. No, don't argue with my needing certain gear even though I'm healing; I don't level as resto. No, I don't want to heal your pet. Stop taunting with your pet. Stop, The only point of a hunter is to farm for fun characters.
---
It's not that I think you're wrong about shamans tanking, it's that the openings to tank dungeons happen in the earlier levels more due to most players in that level range being in leveling specs ( mostly dps), so there can be difficulties finding tanks.
---
At 60 the odds of a group getting a shaman as a tank instead of literally any other shaman spec is very low, you could do that with your friends obviously, but i'm mostly talking about a shaman trying to join a group of people they've never met.
---
Not to mention I'm pretty sure one of your friends is going to be a warrior or druid and they can all tank 5 mans better than you ( shaman), even in dps specs.
---
Thanks for the synopsis 
---
Only in speed runs... Its not necessary until you have the dungeon on farm status after a warrior has already tanked the entire thing and allowed everyone to gear up and are able to create enough threat in the first place.
---
Bear tanks are not viable or needed until well after the dungeon is on farm status and they are way overgeared.
---
Mages don't counter hunters. Sure good mage will try to abuse your deadzone, and good hunters have a lot of options to counter this strategy. If a mage blinks toward you to nova you, you can scatter right after the blink, get distance or cast an Aimed shot during the scatter, the mage has to block or he is fucked. He blocks &gt; you trap, he has to block again or he dead. 
---
There are many items and consumables to get out of a nova, and several ways to prevent the mage from casting on you if you can't/don't want to get out of nova. 
---
A mage with perfect positioning and perfect use of Frostbolt rank 1 and grenades would be tough for sure but good old "nova hunter and pet, sheep pet and burst hunter" rarely works. 
---
Yeah. It's all based on untalented cast time. Casttime/3.5. above lv 20 the cast times are the same
---
"tank as you level" = hope you have friends cuz no one is going to want a shaman tank
---
That damn code is what got me into this way back in college. I hadn't even heard of the game before my buddy gave me that
---
Similar story to me. Got through it by transferring my addictive nature Into obsession with my job. I stopped games for 5 years got married and had a kid and went into recruiting. I’m now more social than ever and make bank running multiple divisions at work. Don’t pity yourself. Ke yourself accountable and Improve every day. Fall in love with someone that pushes you to be better
---
Agreed
---
The Sulfuron Hammer doesn't require you to have Blacksmithing to obtain or use it. Neither does the Hand of Ragnaros.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSMzefQNATAD5wUk](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSMzefQNATAD5wUk)  this seems better. you don't need defense since dungeon mobs are usually 60 or below 60. you can even skip Anticipation an get 3 point into Iron Will. Last Stand is never bad and imp blood rage is really good both pvp and pve since you will lack in 5man content.  Your mitigation usually comes from HP and plate gear for dungeon.  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18168/force-reactive-disk](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18168/force-reactive-disk) aim to get this as soon as you can. Gonna help you ton with Defiance and Sweeping Strikes on multiple mobs. ZG is doable but you need to outgear other people and Dual wield tank sometimes for threat.
---
Nope.
---
Yeah but a MM hunter with similar gear can two shots this mage. Then use ZG trinket and two shots another mage. 
---
RIGHT!? We got slaughtered repeatedly and it was probably the most fun I've ever had in this game. I've enjoyed all of their launch events but this one has always been my favorite. Such glorious chaos!
---
CastSequence is about the interface API, and they're using the 7.3.5 API.  No 1.12 addons will work because its been changed so often since then.  None of the "Select a skill" options are there.  The API will still limit you to one push one action, with protected frames and actions.  So no, you won't be able to hit a button and flick between two spells, and most likely CastSequence will exist, along with mouseover macros and @focus.
---
Is it really a gank if it isn't at least 3 times
---
I don't want to be that negative guy but we as a community are not doing the new players any favors by constantly telling them Bear tanks are viable.
---
They are only viable well after the dungeon is on farm and the Druid is over geared. The bear tank is not going to be a main tank in any SERIOUS raiding guild, please do not set people up for disappointment with comments on how your guild had a bear tank and so on, it is helping absolutely no one.
---
The only guilds with bear tanks were the incredibly slow and nonchalant ones or the guilds who had the dungeons on farm and would speed through them. In those cases you could have almost anyone tank including fury warriors where the healing was good enough that the damage mitigation was not as important.
---
Be fair and be honest !
---
What can we learn here? How can we strive to actually be only casuals and not get obsessed?
---
It was definitely a work around that existed in classic for some time.
---
Yep pretty hyped myself was looking for an old video for a friend and eventually stumbled across an old video from a Hunter mate of mine of when we raided Orgrimmar and instantly hit me in the Member berries.

Tank...PVE...Prot Paladin...
---
It could be any number of things. 
---
1.) People generally just don't like reading, and I'm a lengthy writer.
---
2.) Many people promote faction vs. faction loyalty, are very..."patriotic" in-game, and denounce playing both sides.
---
3.) No one likes a braggart, and, even if telling the story of how I got even with someone who was initially the aggressor (stealing my node I was clearly working to get to), my telling a story of how I won a fight and then talking about how good it felt to win it is going to get /eyeroll from people who find it improbable at best and narcissistic at worst.

4.) Similarly, people dislike 1a.) People insinuating of themselves that they are now wiser than they were (comparing 20-year old me to 34-year old me), but also 1b.) People changing their position to one that isn't shared by many. 
---
In college, I took general psychology, developmental psychology, sociology, general philosophy, ethical philosophy, world religions, four English classes, and have read a slew of books and listened to an assortment of podcasts. 
---
Does this make me "right" or "correct", for certain? Absolutely fucking not. What it *does* mean is that I've considered far more perspectives than 20-year old me had, and that 34-year old me feels more sympathetic with people than 20-year old me, because I *believe* (not "know", but *believe*) that I understand a bit more about what makes people tick and why. 
---
In my mind, we fear/hate what we do not understand, and so more understanding leads to greater sympathy. But many people do not, as I do, believe free will to be an illusion. They do not, as I do, believe that retributive justice (revenge) makes little sense to value. I strive to view malevolent people the same way I would view a hurricane: a violent force of nature that is to be avoided or stopped if possible, but I would not get "emotional" or "angry" at a hurricane, as it is not a sentient thing with intent behind its actions. But, for most people, this absolutely flies in the face of all they believe in, with regards to "good and bad", "justice", and the like. So, if I say something that makes *them* feel like what I'm trying to say is, "Back when I was a dumb kid, I didn't realize this, but I'm now really smart, and I found out that things like free will and punitive justice are bullshit", people are going to hate me and all I stand for, even if they have a misconstrued perception of what it is that I was really attempting to convey...
---
Which, since I personally believe they don't have the free will *not* to feel this way, I try to purge my mind of frustration, and allow them to be in peace. They can down-vote away if they wish, but they must speak what resonates with them, as I am compelled to speak that which resonates with me.      : )
---
You should try picking a few themes: 1 caster, 1 melee, 1 healer etc
---
But they can strictly **remove** /castsequence from the options of commands in the current API.
---
If they're adamant about staying as close to OG vanilla as possible, as they seem to be trying to do, they can just remove it as an option of available macro commands. Removing the command from the table of macro commands should be an easy thing to do and would maintain their vision for the game.
---
I played hunter alot in Vanilla and also on a pserver a year ago. This is probably my favorite class in Vanilla wow. 
---
Its got a great feeling to it and I like it both in PvP, PvE and grinding. And yes, the skill ceiling is high. A couple of macros I would never give up on is feign death frost trap, and one that cycles between cheetah and hawk in one press button.
---
I would play it once more, but I want to try a whole new class this time in Classic. Also, it will feel great not to carry around food for the pet and ammo all the time!
---
The first r14 on REDACTED was a really cool guy. I told him it's really cool to see a troll warrior, and would chat with him whenever we came on each other in Org. Had no idea he was a hardcore player.
---
He ended up giving me the mage recipe for making level 55 food which was going for around 300g at the time.
---
I loved being jumped by rogues as a Holy Priest on the pservers, because I was full T2 and very practiced at fighting off rogues, so I could win most of the time. And after so many dbag rogues ganking me throughout leveling, it's so satisfying to put them in their place as a freaking Holy Priest. Unfortunately, the T2 rogues could usually burst me down if they knew what they were doing..
---
Must be a warrior.
---
As much as some wont like it. And as much as I like no changes. The fact is some of the meta of the game is going to change. AND as many have said, with YEARS of playing wow also comes a slightly more nuanced player base. 
---
I say all that to say.. Lets wait and see and not be the typical ME WARRIOR ONLY I GET TO TANK screaming. Until such time as its proven. 
---
I am holding onto a pipe dream that bears and pallys can pull some stuff off. We shall see how it works out.
---
And before anyone posts that guys youtube video who is some sort of "tank" expert. Save it. Again. Things will be close to 2.12 but hardware and not able to make everything perfect as well as network timings could give just the situation to make it happen.
---
TLDR: It could happen and please don't tell others what they HAVE to play. Thanks :)
---
Of course!
---
That's awesome.
---
Sometimes you just wanna share the love, and god, showing a new player something they haven't seen is so cool.
---
Good l0rd, I forgot about the dead zone. This just gets better everyday lol 
---
Highest threat(most important) even beating dw fury tanks. highest armor highest hp they will have their place in even the best guilds they are not a main tank but a tank for certain fights and scenarios.
---
I think so too. The one factor, is the non-communicator. What do you do with the 1/10 hunter who constantly pulls... Wanders into aggro of mobs in ubrs, doesn't feign death, doesn't put pet on passive, doesn't say a single word...
---
Lord give me patience
---
Haha why don't you? Start a guild while leveling and abandon it at 60, teach till then!
---
I've only leveled Priests and Warriors and a single Druid to level 60, next runner up being Mage at late 40's.
---
I stopped playing my Paladin "Gort" around level 33. I don't think I disliked playing a Paladin but the leveling was getting rough and I hadn't the will to commit.
---
Ahndiir, Peanutz, Dylun. These were my warriors. Night Elf, Orc and Tauren respectively. Each progressing more in PvP rank and Raid completion than the last. I've had a good time as warrior. I raided up to Twin Emperors with the help of my trusty Bonereaver's Edge. From my experience being a Warrior with BRE and Windfury at his back is like holding a sword made of pure power and chaos. It's a delicate balance of keeping your threat below the Tanks while also pushing it to the limits. More than several times when I first got BRE it procc'd more than expected, threw me WAY over aggro and I died. It's spec is called to be the most complex but your main worry is your aggro bar.
---
As for Hunters I leveled one to 30 and ran around STV and PvP'd with a human female mask on as a male troll. It was good fun.
---
I leveled a Shaman to 34 named Captndraenor or something close to it. I don't recall it being too bad.
---
The highest level rogue I've ever had was level 21 before I stopped playing him.
---
Druid was the first thing I ever got to 60. I exclusively played Balance and enjoyed how similar Wrath looked to Lightning Bolt.
---
The highest mage I ever got was level 42 and I disliked it wholeheartedly. I tried AoE farming but had the absolute worst luck ganking. I don't take myself too seriously in PvP but I almost cried it was so bad. I remember complaining in guild chat and seeing someone type out this stupid song about being ganked and it cheered me right up, making me laugh my ass off.
---
Warlocks. Oof. I've leveled a single Warlock to 41. My highlight of Warlock was using soulstones and Noggenfoggers to get to the hidden "Dancing Troll Village". I recall leveling as a warlock to be extremely easy but still time consuming. 
---
Priests are an interesting story. Although I've healed up to Blackwing Lair as Holy and reaching Legionaire as Shadow (and absolutely melting rogues. I recall even destroying a half  Bloodfang rogue with my dumb healing gear/shadow damage set and it felt amazing) I can't say I really enjoyed it too much. It wasn't bad and it was fun.
---
Now I love the idea of Shamans. I love everything about Shamans. I just don't know if I can commit to a class I havn't successfully leveled past 40 previously. My biggest fear is getting to 40, 50 or even 60 and saying "this sucks time to reroll". That's my big issue. Same kind of applies to warlocks except the only thing I like about warlocks is their tool set. Currently I'm torn between Shaman and Warlock.
---
Druids can tank dungeons just fine.
---
It's only raids they have a hard time with. They're one of the highest TPS of all the tanks, can tank aoe very well, and in dungeons, crits and crushes are much less punishing than in raids.
---
Trying to write a book. Its almost as exciting as a fun game.
---
Well regardless if they are a noob or not, if they don’t talk or atleast acknowledge a mistaken, then they are simply an asshole haha
---
Probably not. Loot-whores shacking up with the guild master happened all over the place.
---
The toughest mistakes to correct are the ones unacknowledged
---
i like classic WoW as much or more than any modern mmo's because imho it was a better game.
---
that said, nostalgia is as valid a reason as any to like something.
---
You make a good read.
---
But when you say sympathetic, I could understand you have to condition yourself to be that way? Alternatively maybe your personality or DNA playing a role of empathy for them changing perspective immediately, but not the case at early 20s.
---
I'm not really sure how to explain or whatever. But to ask bluntly. Do you think you used to lack empathy? But have grown into it consciously. Maybe not calling your new self empathetic, but sympathetic? As in a forced reaction because its prefered to most people, making you a better person?
---
If this is to confusing just say that. I know I'd think that way. I ask because I have very little empathy I've noticed. So just curious 
---
Early June will give us news about a release sometime in July or August.
---
I’m curious to see how they release WoW Classic with wc3 reforged. 
---
If it were 3 months ago I would recommend Path of Exile, but things are shit right now.  If it were 9 months ago I would recommend Stellaris, but development has gotten strange there also.
---
For now I suggest Stardew Valley, Subnautica, or Rimworld, but those are just my particular form of time consuming jam.
---
Also Rhadamant has a 100+ episode Kenshi series that I'm really enjoying at the moment.
---
Off-tanking naxx isin't viable? 
---
I’m also waiting for WoW Classic.
---
I spend my time training for WC3 Reforged (I’m also a huge WC3 guy).
---
I also play some HoN on the side 
---
Well shit. 
---
Pretty much all of Kalimdor south of Ashenvale excluding Azshara, Un'Goro Crater, Tanaris, and Silithus.
---
Pepper in some Grom'Gol quests with Swamp of Sorrows, Blasted Lands, Badlands, and the zones north and south of Blackrock Mountain.
---
Your social skills are very above average. You inquired about the other persons interest instead of just talking about yourself 
---
More viable than 2 of the 3 paladin specs. 
---
I played a hunter for many years, Spriests owned me
---
It's Classic Summer!
---
The Summer Solstice is Friday, June 21, 2019 at 3:54 PM GMT (9:54 AM Pacific Time).
---
NA Druid looking for raiding guild on a PvE realm. Raid times I'm looking for either END prior to 9 PM EST or BEGIN after 7 AM EST.
---
Horde or Alliance, just looking for a team in this niche time frame.
---
Don't gank lowbies.  Some do this.  Those people are dicks.
---
I'm afraid to google that.
---
There lots of busy parent guilds that will be doing Fri/sat night raiding. I've seen 2 of them on the lfg thread but can't remember their names. Pretty much guilds built off of the fact that they just don't have much time anymore due to kids or work.
---
Yes and quite ironically many of the biggest bug reports were actually bugs on private servers. Things like charge not putting you in combat and warlock summon mechanics. They went into some detail on these in one of the forum posts, which you're clearly aware of because you link it below.
---
The demo was clearly a very early build, and they said themselves that they rushed it out the door in order to have something to show the players. I'm sure much of the problems in it were already known issues internally that they just didn't have time to fix.
---
I have such a hard on for Arms spec im half tempted to raid with a scrubby casual guild just to play what i want after 10 years of try-hard min max'ing
---
Ah, I see what youre saying. See, I plan to have raids "on farm" after the second week. I will have fun tanking as a druid on horde because I want the game to be difficult because I'm not a pussy. That's were we disagree, I gotcha now.
---
Bear tanks are viable, get over your superiotity complex, gatekeeper
---
Played Druid primarily actually but later switched to a warrior. Its not that I don't want or hope for druids to be viable it's just that they are not for vanilla wow and I don't want to have a throng of mislead newbies who will no doubt feel duped. 
---
Play whatever class and role you want to play, fun is the first priority here but just don't expect to be main tanking initial raid runs as some may be suggesting is possible.
---
&gt; I think it's best to just enjoy what you're doing when you're doing it more than anything else. 
---
Exactly what I wanted to post after reading OP. I disagree with the notion that "I need a guarantee my save file will never be deleted." We play the game to have fun; if Blizzard goes under and it all vanishes, I'll still have had that fun. I don't need a trophy sitting in my inactive account when I move on, that's not the point of playing, it's to enjoy the experience.
---
Nice I remember you guys!
---
Is arms viable for raids?  I'm thinking I want to play an orc warrior, but I'm not a fan of dual wielding. 
---
You are correct for the most part. Even dungeons can be challenging without much AOE threat but it's doable. Raids are where things fall apart for the bear tank.
---
I just got my Zhevra a few days ago :D I picked it over the others because I have a cooler 2 seater flyer, and who doesn't want a unicorn zebra!
---
Do you take Nature's Focus talent points?
---
this made it better
---
Can almost guarantee, as a business, they won't drop a major patch and classic the same day.
---
Would make sense, drop 8.2 then after a month when interest drops / subs drop, then maybe release classic.
---
Time to work on 8.2 issues, then world on classic
---
Yes its different teams, but there is still a fair bit of interaction between retail and classic
---
If you’re bad or dueling I guess? 
---
Hunter has a longer range, priests cant dispel poison, those are facts, not theory. If you have room to kite the priest is fucked. If you don’t, in most cases you can flee. If you’re dueling, you’re fucked unless you use the right combination of trinkets and consumables to OOM the priest without getting hit. 
---
If you let a priest jump you in wpvp despite your longer range and tracking, yeah you’re in a bad spot but that’s your fault. Still, scatter trap and leave, dispel Devouring Plague if needed, he’s not killing you with one SW:P. Reopen from 41 yards 5 minutes later.
---
Still one of the hardest class to beat but you have tools. Warlocks are way harder to deal with imo. 
---
They'll happen and be just as good as warriors, or better, in many situations. 
---
Yup! I have an RaF going atm, XP gained was nerfed to 50% and doesn't stack with heirlooms though, so it's barely worth it anymore, I prefer buying heirlooms for the person so they can level toons without me too
---
Sure but what about the remaining raids and encounters ? If you want to roll druid just to off tank in Naxx if your guild ever gets there then that is perfectly fine. My fear is that the newbies reading these posts will believe they are viable tanks throughout all raids and unfortunately that's not the case.
---
These people are griefers.
---
I agree
---
If they are viable in naxx, they are viable before naxx. Also you seem to be confusing viable and 'optimal'.
---
Certainly everyone can and should play whatever class and role they want. It is not my intent to disuade anyone from their enjoyment.
---
My concern is only for new players who may be mislead to believe that druid tanks can be viable main tanks as their guilds progress through raids. this is simply not the case as we all know.
---
Once you have AQ on farm nobody gives a shit about tankiness anymore and the only thing that matters is tps so druid is even worse then.
---
I feel like I've had to actively try (to a fair degree) to adopt this attitude toward people who are rude/angry/unfair/et cetera. I truly believe that the natural reaction to people who are this way is to resent them for it, and that it takes a degree of self-training to make resentment less reflexive. 
---
I'm not especially confrontational by nature, and so where my focus on mindfulness has been most beneficial is in reducing "dwelling", i.e. playing out instances of a conflict in my own head a few dozen times after the initial conflict ends, and working myself up into a ball of anxiety and hatred about what went down. I had the control not to physically escalate 90%+ of the time, but the afterthoughts were where my mind tortured itself the most. It is self-toxic to do this, solves nothing, and deciding to consider it a problem is the first step in trying to alleviate it.
---
As such, I'd probably rank myself relatively kind-hearted by default. For example, there have been days I was so cynical and had so little faith in humanity, that I told myself, "I'm going to go out into the world and be a fuckin' dick today. People had better get the fuck out of my way,  I'm not stepping out of the way for *them*...and if someone starts a fight? Good. I haven't had a good fight in a *while*..."
---
Then I go to approach a store and find myself reflexively opening the door for someone. Then, another person is so close behind them, that I hold the door open for *them*, too! Then I laugh at myself, like, "What the fuck, Tom?! Didn't we agree that we were going to swing our dick, today? Why are we being courteous to people?!" It simply doesn't seem to be in my nature to try to fit the role of aggressive alpha, even if I once fantasized about having an outlet for my inner rage. 
---
I've been doing Brazilian jiu jitsu and Muay Thai for the past two years, and this has also helped to give me a setting where I can get that physical energy out in a (relatively) safe and respectful context, and I think having that outlet for that testosterone has made me less likely to want to start actual fights. I was also a binge drinker from 16-32, and have been sober for the same two years I've been doing martial arts. I told myself I was going to quit drinking and gaming and become a sober athlete, but now Classic WoW is around the corner, and I'm going to relapse like crazy back into PC gaming and probably gain a few pounds from running/lifting/sparring less...haha.   :P
---
Dont you mean you can't wait to Reincarnate him? :)
---
Actually ignorin the Shaman ability for a sec, reincarnation is the idea of being born anew, so it works perfectly here!
---
No superiority complex. I played both classes and loved them in their own ways.
---
If you read some of my other replies on this post it is my concern that new players may be mislead to believe that druid tanks could main tank raids as their group progresses. It is not really viable. Any group choosing to do this is just making their lives much harder for no benefit.
---
I'd rather take the bag space
---
Not if you use Ublock Origin like the rest of us :D
---
I remember not being able to play on BfA launch and just giving up for the day. I am aware now that only a handful of servers had this issue, so I guess it can't be called a disaster.
---
I think Legion was the smoothest of all in recent years; WoD was the worst, but that was almost five years ago.
---
How? Is Classic going to be a different game than the classic we all know and love ? I'm not sure why you believe this, but if it happens and something changes I think that's great for the game as a whole.
---
Bear tanks are better than Warriors for 5mans and can handle almost any relevant encounter if the healers aren't braindead. 
---
Now Paladin tanks are a different story
---
Fun fact, there's a few database oopsie daisies like the Sunstrider Guardian from Eversong Woods being in there. Also go to Zones and click many of those crazy named ones, they got reused in Wrath!
---
Having fun looking at these until they fix it all up
---
Isn’t 150 ping good or am I missing something?
---
They aren't main tanks for raids and i haven't seen anyone pushing that message on this sub or otherwise they are 100% viable in dungeons and as off tanks even in bleeding edge content. Bear tanks will happen.
---
I started on arrow keys way back in the day when that is what everyone used, moved on to wasd, then used esdf for a stint before going back to wasd. I did not experience a noticeable difference between wasd and esdf and I found it not worth the hassle of messing with keybinds in every game.
---
What really changed my game was using the mwheelup and mwheeldown for abilities rather than zoom or weapon swap. Then I got a mouse with a tilt wheel, giving me 2 more binds. 5 key binds on just the mouse wheel is powerful.
---
Yeah I'd never thought about dipping out of Anticipation to pick up Last Stand, but good call!
---
Any class can tank then in this case. Paladin, rogue, shaman, any of them are technically viable in the right set of circumstances. Let's not split hairs, my point is around tanking with the hope or goal of progression in a raiding guild. 
---
I have had some of the same issues actually. This April 12 will be 4 years clean for me. I probabaly have a lot of the same principles as you. Basically the 90% is taking responsibility for yourself, because you are an adult. No matter what the issue, problem is. From childhood to work, to your vehicle and everything else. It ultimatley is your responsibility and nobody else.
---
No not really. Viable means within a certain range of performance and includes consistency. Feral tanks have the mechanics and kit to tank and don't run out of resources say like mana. Also, they have more than just evasion for example. Completely different.
---
I hate how Retail is moving but don't call all us Retail Players "moronic". I love and will play both games, because they're VASTLY different games. Nobody would compare FarmVille to Runescape. I love collecting on Retail, and I love my Monk gameplay. But I want Classic RPG feels.
---
I'll play both, two itches for two games.
---
EDIT: I am an idiot and misread this, good night pals
---
Yah I'm using esdf atm. Started a few weeks ago. I  an play repetition fine. Like raiding. But pvp has really gone down hill for me
---
What if it awarded no XP?
---
I bet they'd be busy doing the same xpac prep steps to prevent DDoS attacks and stuff, so yea the interactions will probably be high
---
Yeah I don't get the whole "its just nostalgia, you don't actually like the game."  
---
Nostalgia is literally remembering something I liked haha. If the game was shit, I wouldnt be all nostalgic about it.
---
*smites you*
---
you're post makes no sense to me
---
this guy (above me, not crendor) sounds like a whiney troll from the barrens, but less funny
---
Thanks for the informative input. Speaking of an easy class to learn to heal on, if you have any experience with them, paladins seem to be another easy class to master with FoL and HL being the only spells you're using? I'm still leaning towards druid as the leveling experience and utility are much more appealing.
---
Very nice 🤠
---
Its fairly easy, the challenge is in not overhealing, and watching your mana.
---
Neither of these things really matter in modern WoW, bar for Mistweaver Monks who have at times mana issues.
---
It's pretty bad, they're just their to buff up warlock damage
---
I healed in classic. It's really not too bad, especially if you have an addon for decursing. Besides you'll get the hang of dungeons easily by doing the odd dungeon levelling up. If you want to heal, really won't have a problem. It's slightly "harder" than DPSing, but easier than tanking. 
---
Private servers proved its not just nostalgia. They went strong for years.
---
Well thanks buddy, I appreciate that. How you doing this fine evening? 
---
you sure got me good
---
Duuude. She sounds like a bitch. If playing a video game would incline you to divorce someone then they can fuck right off.
---
That’s kinda funny haha
---
I could understand this if it was back in the day, but now that the manual crowd pummeller trick has been figured out I'd say they're definitely viable, from what I've heard anyways.
---
Do it. 
---
The group dynamics in-general are different in classic (not just healing).
---
Like Stratholme --
---
- Gargoyles fear bomb.
---
- Guardsman silence (an 8s silence).
---
- Maleki drains mana.
---
- Baroness mind controls.
---
It's like -- almost every pull there will be a mob you have to watch out for. An 8s silence on the healer is no joke.
---
Some of this you have to watch as a healer. Like, don't heal the tank before they get a few hits in (so you don't get healing aggro). But you'll get the hang of this by the time you're 60.
---
I would say that -- compared to retail -- it's a lot harder to heal through stupidity in Classic. If a DPS goes ham and pulls a few mobs in a dungeon, they're likely dead. 
---
*But*, you also have more in your kit in classic. DI, BoP, LoH, Bubble, HoJ, Judging Light/Wis, Salv, etc. So while I do think it's harder to heal through stupidity in Classic -- it's a lot more fun trying. :)
---
I bet that was a weird convo.. 
---
"where do you live?"
---
"right near you..."
---
If bears are in such a dismal place then the new players will play resto or they'll reroll. Its not the end of the world. This has happened to everyone at least once. Its almost a rite of passage at this point.
---
Transfers can really fuck up a server though, I remember always rolling to the fresh servers on Vanilla since I loved the leveling to MC stage of progression. I quit doing this when a server "Andorhal" at the time had not even killed Ragnaros when we had several people from mid aq40 transfer over. Wrecked progression since a tank with aq40 gear made a lot of the lower level progression pretty trivial. PvP also quit being much fun getting stomped into the ground with a Warrior having Ashkandi while you still have a few dungeon blues on your rogue.
---
 &amp;nbsp;
---
Yup. Some people just can't get the concept that some people can like older stuff, even if dated compared to today, because of gameplay. To some, QoL is what makes a game good.
---
well you just showed you have no idea what you are talking about.  
---
Twinks were always a minority in BG's.   when queues were seperated you went from 100% of the playerbase of a bracket queueing in to the same battlegrounds.  to 10% of the playerbase of a bracket being seperated in to a different queue.
---
Because of this, queue times increased exponentially.  what used to be &gt;1 queue times went up to 1 hour queue times.   there was also a bug with queue times after its implementation which also increased queue times.    
---
people didn't want to spend 1+ hours in a queue. so when somebody drops queue to do something else, this increases the queue times even more.  rinse and repeat, queue times go up 5+ hours, and at this point nobody is going to even care about trying to get in to a match.    
---
some battlegroups who had higher amount of twink players were able to get steady games throughout the day for a while, but queue times were still long which made people lose interest.  and this was for the 19 bracket which was by far the most popular.  every other bracket was almost instantly dead because not as many twinks in those brackets to begin with.
---
Agreeable, I just enjoy the fact that bears are the most player friendly tank to hop on board with. Starting a group for any keystone will (usually) take it’s sweet time waiting for a tank to arrive. 
---
The game could certainly use more tanks &amp; im more than willing to show other players the ins and outs of the bear ways. It’s certainly not the greatest but if they take a liking to it, they may try prot or BrM.
---
I'm going to recruit for a leveling guild the moment we have a release date. I'm eager to go in with at least a dozen people who pre-selected which faction/server WE are headed to in order to found a leveling guild where we can take turns enchanting each other's gear, making one another's potions, etc. as we make the first step. I began playing back in 2006, and it was a blast. I hope other people on other servers are likewise thinking of doing as you say by either founding or joining a leveling guild and helping one another out.
---
Fair enough ! Perhaps it's for the best.
---
This is perfect, thank you
---
List does not include Carrot on a Stick from shimmering flats, by far the best item of all of classic.
---
I've never been infected, but it makes the website so heavy that it makes this small PC hot to the touch just to have it open in the background. 
---
No regrets. Past has happened. Azeroth awaits..
---
&gt; would chat with him whenever we came on each other in Org. Had no idea he was a hardcore player.
---
Lol sounds so gay
---
You can 2h fury, but no, arms is not viable unfortunately
---
Great to know, thanks
---
It won't? When will it be available?
---
Yup. They can do some 40 man as well
---
Loved these old events
---
That's reassuring to know lol, thank you
---
Sometimes you identify with what you already are. Most Dnd doesn’t have you pick horde type races and Lotr obviously has humans and the like as the heroes. Even to this day in GoT not much has changed. 
---
They can. You can have a priest main tank if you want. Stop gatekeeping.
---
If people want to be suboptimal, let them. Then sit in your guild and reeeee at them from afar
---
Did you mean "Dear god no"?
---
If you are gonna heal pick a shaman. You dont take to buff anyone, and totems are always needed.
---
Lol? Hi mr paladin my name is mr hunter. What happens when I vipersting you? Oh you lose all your mana and are a useless tin can? 
---
Derp 
---
No Warrior who has to mix in a bunch of threat gear is going to be able to match the durability of a Druid, though, who can also output an insane threat ceiling when necessary. Bears have great threat, survivability, and dps all at once even if they can't top threat or dps like a warrior can. Druids also contribute great additional overall raid dps through Leader of the Pack.
---
Avoiding downtime by pooping in a sock instead of going to the bathroom.  
---
Figuratively.  
---
Probably.
---
Where is it :)?
---
Cool.
---
That's right. You level to 60 and *then* you gank lowbies! 
---
2h fury is super viable on horde if you have a good weapon. But you HAVE to have a WF totem. If you dont you go from being competitive to being a feral druid that doesnt buff the group. 
---
The codes have never really mattered anyway. They used to give 3-5 of them in every Blizzard game box and if you wanted to try WoW you just had to go to the website
---
Oh no, mr priest came too!! He’s draining my mana in 3 casts...don’t worry I can run really slow and try to stop him. Oh he trinket my stun and now I can’t do anything...
---
Classic is my real Carrot on a stick 
---
As someone who is completely garbage at healing even I can heal in classic (played a resto shaman on *a certain servers that shall not be named*) 
---
Raiding is very relaxing as a healer and the only time you'll have to actually try is in PVP or a dungeon group that have no idea what theyre doing.
---
There's a big difference between playing WoW in your spare time and putting it ahead of everything else.
---
It definitely sounded like OP's dad went way over the line and neglected his responsibilities in favor of the game.
---
Not to imply I'm even slightly in a position to criticize OP's dad.
---
Know. Yec. Mayb.
---
I would second this. It took an embarrassing amount of playing to finally decide, but now I know. 
---
Nah it's more of I refuse to use them because they are knowingly infecting people with malware
---
I started playing Elder Scrolls Online a couple of days ago and it's pretty damn awesome. I see Classic as being the only game that could pull me away from ESO right now.
---
Boomkin.   Just go Boomkin.
---
 Boomkin Dance!   
---
It's debatable if that would be considered 'competitive' in tanking. You lose around 50% threat generation, 20% stamina, no fairie fire, less armor  compared to a pve tank spec.
---
At this point we could really say you can fulfill any role as a druid without any talent points. Yeah, in theory if the team is good, you can.
---
I'm right there with you!!
---
Not to be rude, but that's because they are being compared to different games. Back then Vanilla WoW was being compared to Everquest and its ilk. Whereas Vanilla WoW is now being compared to Modern WoW and other modern RPGs single and multiplayer. Both arguments are valid, but they're strictly speaking within different context. Vanilla WoW is handholdly in comparison to MMOs of its era, but in comparison to modern game design its the opposite. It's not so much funny as relative. They're both true.
---
if i ever felt this way, it was because all the cool shit was locked behind raids.  
---
new recipes, the mats for it, book to learn higher level skills...especially the difference in gap between what you can get from 5 mans and raiding.
---
Only shitty people gank lowbies 
---
Ouch
---
I think warrior will be a popular choice, but I doubt many people will be able to push through and level them all the way to 60. They're also the most common choice for raid main tank, so you'll always be in need. Actually anyone who is willing to play as either a tank or a healer will always be in need because they're a little slower to play / farm with and for many people they're less exciting than the DPS choices. (Side note: I hear one of the warrior DPS specs is becoming popular for tanking. I don't know anything about warriors but you might want to check that out.)
---
At the end of the day, you should focus on what you want to play because you'll be spending a lot of time with that character and you need to be happy. Anything can be viable so focus on what you'll have the most fun with. 
---
This isn't specific to classic. It's not even specific to wow in any iteration. If everyone practiced this everywhere the entire internet would be a much nicer place.
---
They can. In which case the OP is completely out of luck and the two spells have to be different buttons. 
---
TIL that paladins are useful in group PvP in vanilla. How bout that 
---
I never played Paladin but that class is as easy as it gets. Too easy for my liking.
---
Druid versatility is legendary for good reason. Yes they aren't as good as the natural class equivalent, but the fact is that at any time you can essentially be any class in the game other than Warlock and Hunter. The individual component pieces are still great, and are definitely more than the sum of their parts. There are lots of little fun things that break up the monotony of raiding and PvP like shifting into cat when you get blown up on Geddon, or just randomly popping into bear form to toy with people in AB while your group massacres people. I wouldn't trade it for the world.
---
Well I mean any instance of "wow ruined my life" isn't technically wow's fault lol
---
saved
---
The evidence is the guy in the demo is level 16 right and the name has something to do with July?
---
I’m probably wrong here but man I hope you’re right. That doesn’t conflict with anything I have going on in those months 
---
Had to recheck the sub. Iam still not convinced you are talking about classic. But if you acutally do - LMFAO
---
I started in Vanilla and stopped playing in MoP but it wasn’t until last year that a few of these things finally got tossed out. 
---
#NoChanges
---
Nope, not Stormrage. I've heard of this kind of thing happening a few times, though. I don't think it's rare.
---
Yeah I prefer older wow to the modern MMORPGs. I think I'm mostly nostalgic for the experinces I had back in vanilla and my old friends.
---
The run from rachet was so painfully long.
---
&gt;the only thing that matters is tps so druid is even worse then.
---
Since when does warrior generate more threat than a bear?
---
lol not Emerald Dream, either. I've heard of it happening a few times, but I think it's more common than I thought for people to be tossing out specific servers lol
---
You are not even allowed to have both Horde and Alliance characters on the same server if it's PVP, let alone be allowed to trade items and gold. On PVE servers you had to put stuff up on the neutral AH and have someone buy it and trade you the gold. 
---
Don’t give this troll the light of day. Keep up the great content, Thraex! I met you on a pserver a couple weeks ago and love your vids.
---
They cleanse it you dope. 
---
Out of curiosity, how many does engineering provide?
---
Kinda torn 50/50
---
Focused on Career so might play casually. 
---
Might be frustrated playing casually with slow leveling and bad gear .
---
If I focus less in Career can game all the time.....( bad idea)
---
And then you run into a paladin that's not braindead and realize that you'll be oom from spamming viper sting before they get to 50% mana because they can just dispel it right away. 
---
Are you trolling or actually this clueless?
---
HOLY SGIT!
---
*Holy* paladins. 
---
Expect there to be inefficiencies and imbalances in the game that have resulted in a very established meta as to how things go. This applies to everything, from what specs are "memespecs," to what trash mobs you can skip in Dungeon A and what pixel shortcut you need to take on the way to Boss B, etc. Basically, knowledge is power in Vanilla, much much much more so than there being an actual mechanical skillcap. That's not to say there is no skill involved; skilled players have ample opportunity to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack. But 80% of the game is understanding all it's quirks, how those quirks affect your character, and leveraging that to your advantage against static content or other players who might know less than you.
---
Honestly it's blast. I played vanilla back in the day but I remember so little of the vital gameplay knowledge that playing on a pserver has been something of a first time for me in many ways. It's an absolute blast. There's always something new to learn or figure out.
---
Not an option sadly, going to be playing Alliance side 
---
I appreciate you helping clarify the tone, and would edit it from "whinging about" to "remarking on", were it not for original post integrity. The people who have cast karma votes did so on the perceived merit (or lack thereof) of the original statement, and I'm quirky enough to not want to edit a thing once people have begun responding to it so that the record is accurate.
---
Good to know!
---
When you think about it, vanilla really was the blunderyears of wow toons
---
Nah he's trolling, he was doing the same shit the other day until a mod came and deleted his comment because it was straight up intentional misinformation.
---
&gt; You are a mana heavy class, so try not to use multi-shot unless there are 6+ mobs. Your main rotation should start with a aimshot, then you rotate between serpent sting, arcane shot and auto shot. If you see serpent sting drop off the debuff bar it’s a small bug in 1.12 so just keep reapplying it. When your mana is low, ask the Druid for an innervate...there should be minimum 6-8 druids in the raid because battle Rez and innervate are needed for every group. During innervate you can cast a few multi shots for more dps.
---
&gt; You need herbalism as a hunter. To get your Rhok-dolar you have to herb the “petrified leaf” off of a rare stone golem named “Golemagg”. He only spawns 1 in every 10 runs and you don’t want to miss the chance.
---
&gt;Other then that enjoy it! Your tier 1 set isn’t the best in stats so you will probably stick with your dungeon set for most of MC, but it does look pretty cool. Have fun :)
---
It's not just MS that takes a debuff slot, it's rend and deep wounds too. You know you can raid as a 2H fury as well though.
---
Viable for five and ten man stuff yes. May be a bit more difficult than doing it as a protective warrior but doable !
---
You know what's kinda crazy to think about? How Gnomeregan is such a gauntlet no matter the faction. I didn't even *know* that Horde had an easier way to get there (via teleporter from STV - a chain quest starting in Ratchet) and that both factions have immense repercussions in PvP stratem when it comes to the dungeon. Gnomish Discombobulator Ray will remain a #1 hidden article at this rate, and is absolutely amazing in WPvP
---
*laughs in hardiness*
---
I'm worried you are going to have heart disease.
---
TBC wasn't really that different from Vanilla, do you have any specific questions? I can run through some of the main things
---
* No flying mounts
---
* No arenas, competitive pvp is mainly doing premade BGs
---
* No heroic dungeons, there's a handful of level 55-60 dungeons
---
* No daily quests
---
* Paladins are Alliance exclusive, Shamans for Horde
---
Warlocks are a good choice for Vanilla in all aspects of the game. Leveling, soloing, gold farming, dungeons, raids, Bgs, world pvp, dueling,  they are good at everything.
---
Playing with friends?
---
I don’t know your play style wether you are a min/max raider, casual, or PvPer but I’ll give you my two cents on the matter and it may change how you feel or help you make a decision. The past couple expansion I’ve gotten very deep into the lore, in game, books, comics, etc but it has made me enjoy the different classes in a totally different way. Paladins and druids in particular have such deep rich lore and it makes playing those classes so much enjoyable. The quests in Legion really knocks it out of the park with the class halls. Being a Paladin main made me go back and play the old RTS warcrafts and just really just dive into that class. Also I recommend reading the Chronicles if you haven’t, it brings the game to a whole new level.
---
i was the king of  **recruit a friend**  back in the day.. i got each mount as they were available starting with the zebra i had like 5 accounts linked to my own
---
Awesome help you did above! If you're bored, can you help me decide on Rogue, Priest, or Hunter? Alliance for me so no shaman unfortunately. I would pick shaman instantly if I were horde. Sadly, all my friends are going alliance. 
---
how much?
---
Tbh, 1/5 were my first two.  I was originally going to play a Warlock, but i want to play a Dwarf more, so i had limited options.  Ended up deciding on priest because of it.
---
Of course they can do whatever they want. But imagine you rolled druid because you were lead to believe you could tank. You grinded to 60 only to ultimately realize no raid would take you as a tank and wish someone would have told you. That's not a pleasant feeling... 
---
I am only hoping to avoid that!
---
warrior!  You'll be both good DPS and the only realistic tank for raids
---
Whenever I see an undead rogue walk in my vicinity I immediately assume I'm gonna die, and most of the time I'm right
---
Fun stuff keep em coming! Finding and reading all the books is one of my low key long term goals for Classic.
---
Yep
---
Oh here we go, been waiting to tell this story.
---
I was in a pretty nice guild in cata, we would down heroic raids but we cleared normals pretty regularly.
---
I was in a guild group running 5 man Zul’aman when the Amani War bear drops after we successfully got to the last secret troll boss within the time limit.  I win the roll...  A tauren druid begs me in chat.  I feel my heart grow ten sizes and foolishly trade him the bear...  He takes it.  Doesn’t equip it, and leaves the party without thanking me.  I was outraged.  I called him out in gchat for being a selfish asshole who couldn’t even make it known to the guild that I gave it to him.  Nothing.  Silence in the guild.
---
Moving forward to MoP, I’m in the same guild.  This SAME guy asks me if he can have me make him a gun from engineering which used 2 or 3 days of my BoP daily crafting mats.  I AGAIN did ANOTHER favor for him, he never said thank you, never gave me a tip, just took the fucking gun and continued on with his business.
---
Moving forward further on in MoP, I am leading the rated BG group for the guild and trying to fill our raid.  People in guild chat all saying “inv”, when of course he decides he’s going to ask for an invite as well.  I made it a point to ping random PUGS and fill the group while ignoring him.  No one cared as he bitched in chat, just as no one cared when he didn’t say sorry to me.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Man, I really love Morrowind :D
---
Same here, I keep drifting off to mage, lock and rogue...but in the end it will most likely be feral again.
---
Personally I tested everything on an instant 60 server to get a feel for everything. And while my first 4k soulfire onshot, shatter cents or perfect stun locks were fun, nothing is as engaging and diverse as druid. Although I dread having to grind at least r12, exalted with the bgs and probably have to raid a lot to get where I want to be
---
One of the best parts for me will be that everyone is on equal footing. Playing as a new guy in retail sucks because you're the only one who doesn't have a flashy mount with amazing looking armor or sexy title.
---
The thing that keeps me in a head spin about class choice is...what if TBC happens? What would my class look like then?
---
Obviously this is hypothetical as we've heard nothing but it's the real voice on my shoulder atm that keeps me from just sticking with one class.
---
Currently I'm trying to choose between Priest or Paladin which is hard enough already.  
---
Imo Druids are better tanks for 5/10 mans because they deal a lot more damage than prot warriors which enables you to clear dungeons much quicker.
---
I remember a guy named Caber that was exactly like that: troll warrior, realm first r14 and really chill dude. He definitely had a different air about him compared to the other hardcore players.
---
I’ve read your comments in this thread. I think people are downvoting because you are ignorant and don’t understand software very well.
---
Thing is time makes you forget the bad parts, so nostalgia can twist the expectations unrealistically
---
The Division 2 will give you a good 50 hours of loot grinding as well as fun and engaging game play if you enjoy a more tactical shooter style. 
---
almost forgot about that classic bear form...obviously it hasn't aged well, but I think it was neat how they almost went for a were-bear look with the facial features being a blend of humanoid and animal
---
Once you’re all leveled out nothing really beats a pvp server for me 
---
If anyone else thinks this things comment is incredible you need to see its history. What an impressive specimen. 
---
what did you choose??
---
I use similar layouts across all pc games I play where possible. I base them off an old keybind layout I found a long time ago and liked.
---
123456 QETY  
---
ASDFGH ZXCVB
---
W and R are strafe left/right. I don't have a forward/backpedal bind because I can reach my arrow keys in the event I feel the need to use them and autorun is re-bound to middle mouse click. I also have no problem quickly mouse-turning sidways and strafing at an angle that still allows me to attack while moving out of something I wish to avoid. I also re-bind any UI elements that conflict with this layout (usually to a shift click).
---
Since I main healers almost exclusively I'm able to free up a lot of action bar space by binding my heals to mouseclicks. On non-healers I also bind some common spam or utility to mouseclicks if I need to free up keybinds.
---
1-5 are kind of free for all, my spammy damagers/basic rotation, OR buffs/support/utility, one or the other depending on what I'm playing. 6 is always a stun.
---
Q is always an interrupt. E is sometimes a guard, sometimes not. T and Y are my most commonly used AoEs.
---
S is a snare or other CC ability usually. D is for CC almost always. G is always my best "oh shit" guard like pally bubble, and H is usually food/water or some sort of self heal/mana regen.
---
V is always a sprint/movement speed increase. Ctrl+F is always a mount.
---
The rest are filled up with whatever I think is important for whatever I'm currently doing. Games that support macroing, I'll make conditional macros to free up some bar space.
---
"turn around"
---
this guy dwarfs
---
Healing is the easiest role in the game, by far. I can't even tell you what 90% of the bosses in MC or BWL do, but I've healed all of them.
---
Going in as a Druid tank: I have to learn everything.
---
Wish I could mage dwarf
---
There's a server I play right now who's name rhymes with Tight Scope and it has 4-6k concurrent users daily and every zone I've been to level 1-30 is swarming with people, and the 1-10 zones have 15-30+ people going through at any given time. They're still going strong and it certainly is not just nostalgia
---
Happy cakeday!

---
just gonna leave this here if you're interested in a deep dive
---
Yeah it was Caber. Pretty sure he took about 2 months off work for that grind. Super chill dude.
---
dude you and me both. the class creator kevin jordan basically said they had to cut mage class from dwarves because it was too op for dwarves to be everything; but that's why the blink spell icon is still a dwarf
---
Priests should carry consumables to clear poison then.  They should even for pve purposes, but if I was getting owned by hunters oomkiting me I would bring some consumables that easily counter that
---
Man you guys take these so seriously!
---
Dwarfs master race they should be everything 
---
Then what's the point? 
---
i want to see a dwarf druid where all the shapeshift forms dont look any different because fuck you im a dwarf you cant improve on perfection
---
Nah the dwarf forms would just be dwarf with different hoods on like feral would be a wolf hood and tank would be a bear hood and just use barefists
---
Your bait is very low effort yet somehow they still bite. Fascinating 🤔
---
new idea: nelf druid should just shapeshift into dwarves. so dwarf warrior instead of bear, dwarf rogue instead of feral, and dwarf priest instead of boomy
---
Hahahaha
---
Wow didn't know it was for horde too. TIL, thanks
---
[This comment chain in a nutshell](https://i.imgur.com/Qj4Vf5A.jpg)
---
You forgot to factor in Ally having 3. ret paladins who take up a spot
---
Well, it’s vanilla. 
---
Spriet owns hunter,  so hunter learns how to oomkite, so spriest brings anti-venom/poison elixir etc... so hunter farms DMN and buys shadow protection pots or forgot-its-name pot that dispels SW:P? Jungle Remedy/Stoneform for Devouring Plague etc. Priest could use engi items to root the hunter. Hunter could have a reflector... 
---
My point was, saying hunter has « no chance » is wrong. You have tons of options to beat priests, from two shoting them from 41 yd while they’re drinking to rotating cc/stealth/invisibilities/immunities to oom someone without being touched even within a duel area, and everything in between. 
---
Damn them.
---
Steel weapon chain to apply it you must be bs
---
Bad wording, I meant competitive as in you can represent yourself well on healing meters, and you're absolutely not carried. With good consumable usage and knowledge of when tanks will take damage in advance I was able to be top 3 on most fights in mc where druids are not required to decurse. Tanking in dungeons is a breeze, just make sure you have a full leather set(no cloth pieces) You'll pull good threat on aoe packs - and bosses for that matter - with pre-heals and your kit allows you to handle them well
---
desperately needed content but it’s not being made because no one has the necessary knowledge. it’s easier to make ‘what class should you play’ or ‘top 10’ videos that require about 30 mins worth of research in advance. 
---
I played every class a fair amount, did dungeons with all of them, etc. Ended up unexpectedly loving Lock. I just love the feel of the class. Didn’t even think I was in to edgelord stuff but turns out I kinda dig it.
---
Horde or Alliance point of view?
---
They were included with expansions and I think even game time cards. 
---
I still play Pokemon silver from time to time because it was my favorite pokemon game when i was younger and every time i play it, it still strikes that bit of joy from when i was younger. Wow classic has a similar feeling for me just at a different time in my life. And im hoping that same feeling of joy will strike in me so i can feel nostalgic and relive some pretty great memories. 
---
I call it stress test in the loosest possible meaning. Have a totally open public (PR) test period to promote the game, see that everything is setup correctly for loads. Would help the addon community too to test their stuff (IF) they launch the LUA changes before that...
---
It would give them some data of the general interest regarding the game PER region, how many servers to setup etc.
---
And a high end experience in vanilla. Can you tell the same?
---
druids watch stormx
---
My parents wouldn’t let me buy the game as a kid because they thought I would get too addicted, so I made tons of 10 day free trials and one time I got a 14 day free trial for Starcraft and saved that sucker for a solid year. Eventually I did buy the game and got addicted so I guess they were right 
---
People tend to dislike videos that seem to conveniently be just over the threshold for midroll revenue (this one is 10:08) that discuss something that's just as easily covered by a 100 word text post.
---
lol no one actually specs ret. 
---
they’re extremely good defensive healers in group pvp. one of the best additions to a premise aside from a fr druid in wsg. 
---
Actually vQueue just reads the chat so you can be the only guy on the server with the addon and it still works as intended.
---
I think theres also a degree of ego to it as well tbh.
---
Some ppl cant concede that anything they werent around to play, or didn't care to, could be worth playing even still all these years later. 
---
i mean druids can’t really become effective ranged dps either. 
---
Druids are literally the better tank for patchwork. Also better tanks early for MC. The list goes on they are a very valuable resource.
---
Orc/Stun resist helps against: rogue, paladin, shadow priest
---
Gnome/escape artist helps against: mage, hunter, warrior, shaman, paladin
---
Orcs: Warriors already stomp rogues and /bored them while stunned, and I'm pretty sure they own spriests too (not sure because just trolling), so 1 blackout proc probably won't stop the pain train anyway. Save paladins for later.
---
Gnomes: breaking out of frost nova is godly. Breaking a wing clip or frost shock or earthbind while your gap closers are on CD sound quite good. Save paladins for later. Overall, stun resist helps with matchups that warrior already does well in. Escape artist is a super strong tool that helps against bad matchups.
---
Paladins: this is gnome's best racial ability. Never have to fight a paladin, meaning 100% HOJ stun resist by default. + getting a paladin's support, especially BoF = gg.
---
By this comparison, clearly gnome = master race.
---
So all you could possible mean is the mighty blood fury, and access to windfury totem, for pve. 
---
So you admit it's not click bait you are just mad about... Nothing.
---
You say this about all you tube Vids or...?
---
You could just ignore Vids and read the wiki or something.
---
  Just seems like you are being a poppy pants bud. 
---
Different play styles in pvp. Paladin is king of defensive play and shaman is king of offensive style. 
---
I think the biggest advantage paladin actually has that 1 pally can individually buff a 40man raid per their BEST stat or requirement. Shammy is limited to his party and kinda one trick pony inside that party, too. 
---
It evens out when go beyond 5 shammys, since at that point pally buffs are maxed out. Currently playing a paladin in private server, going to make at least a alt shaman in classic, if not main.
---
Ps. And being a pally in nef fight is MUCH safer than a shammy. WF on nefarious isnt fun for healers.
---
Right! Man we are all so bored, ugh...
---
Thanks for the kind words man, hope we succeeded at whatever we were doing 
---
I never said it was clickbait or that I was mad about anything, I was explaining why some people don't like this content..
---
You will decide when the time comes
---
And you won't play that anyway

i haven’t bought a game time card in years so I don’t even remember lol
---
This is the real reason all those private servers die before naxx, not because of a new server coming along. During the early phases of progression paladins are tolerable, and even a bit pitiful and silly looking while they are stuck wearing gear that was originally intended for other classes. But once they are rocking T2 with lok'amir, and even more painful shit like meteor trinket later on... yeah, uh, when's the next fresh?
---
underrated comment
---
True hero mate. I hope things work out. 100k is very reasonable and you should be able to pay that entire thing off relatively quick. I live in one of the biggest cities of Sweden, and even a small run down house that could house a family is 300k+. I make a bit more than you though, so I guess it evens out a little bit at least.
---
Sounds like you deserve a month off for classic. :D
---
It always confuses me how Blizzard had this keyboard and the default controls/UI designed in a way that encourages clicking over key binding.
---
&gt;Elsweyr 
---
Is it any good? All the previous ones were so dumb, like quests written for a frost troll to read.
---
not to mention if youre on a multi-target fight (OR TRASH - DONT FORGET 2/3 OF RAIDING IS TRASH) the 3% crit also helps your fellow tanks build a ton of extra threat!
---
I bought it and played for about 2 hours. Kinda regret getting it as I don't feel engaged with it at all =/
---
That's egg on my face, enough reddit for me tonight
---
To be fair, I think even with sharding we will have to heavily compete with mobs. They can only have so many virtualizations as well. Which do scale well but you know right at the start it wouldn’t surprise me to see 1 million players hopping on in the first week.
---
Yo can I get a run through sm?
---
Numerous trinkets, bombs, rocket boots, mindcontrol caps, parachute cloak, engineering random stat heads in general...
---
I prefer my elemental shaman tactical nuke.
---
3K is still a change, the servers were capped at 2.5K.
---
As a person who has never play any iteration of WoW and is coming to vanilla as a complete utter noob who will probably suck ass for months but also take in the vistas and the epic ness of WoW in its most purest form for the second time in our lifetimes for those of us who has never played it and have been waiting on this day, you the REAL mvp.

This, get your 1-10 down pat though it won't be the same due to how many people will be in the starting zone ( even with 2-3k players between horde and alliance is a full house starting zone and impossible to get mob tags)  do the starting zone get a feel of the Quests, what you can and can't do, practice grinding mobs higher than you ( For example if the Human starting area is full, A Human Paladin can solo level 5 Defias at level 1 ) getting that level 10 early will help A LOT on release for getting ahead of the zerg and even getting professions up quicker since you will be able to nuke those lowbie mobs quicker to get nodes.
---
Doing this you won't burn yourself out either as you're not grinding to 60 just to have Classic drop. 6-10 is also some of the harder levelling for all the classes out there so getting that down pat will minimise your frustration come Classic.

In the Sims, you could literally box your characters in a four-walled room, with no food and no door to leave out from. So, essentially the reference he's making is bleak, dark humor.
---
&gt;did anyone ever choose the sword or mace?
---
On a private server as a human (alt) i did. Mostly because i had taken the axe so many times, i thought the sword looked better AND people lost their mind when they saw me with it. 
---
Yeah he is attempting a combination of strawmanning and moving the goal post when he takes your comment so abstractly that "technically a lvl 55 warrior can walk into MC so he could tank hurr hurr hurr how does it feel to be up against my invincible arguments"
---
Druids aren't a class you can walk into a raid and be maintank in every single fight, they can offtank probably most fights, they can maintank certain fights, and sometimes be the better choice but never essential. People will for the most part understand this when rolling a niche class.
---
Better tank for progression into MC, gear em up with AQ gear and everything pre naxx is on par with warrior as far as threat.
---
All that leather with dodge and hit has to go somewhere, might as well be your Druid tank.
---
Lots of things to consider outside of a raiding stand-point and so far druid is more than likely the class I'll pick up. Thanks
---
Everything can be a tank if your healers are brave (overgeared for the content) enough
---
Pvp servers absolutly have a plethora of PvE-guilds. It’s more a choice of what kind of lvling you want
---
Earthmother watch over you.
---
since we are starting with 1.12 the old 'rogue beats all' won't apply anymore. Plenty of rogue nerfs and buffs to the overall performance of other classes lead to the decline in the rogue population from AQ40's release and onwards
---
\-
---
That's something people often overlook when they watch the 3 episodes of world of roguecraft. They've covered the current patch states very accurately in them. 
---
&gt;I used to dominate my enemies with my eyes closed because I'm such a skilled ninja  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Now I can't kill anyone without using all my timers
---
exaggerated, but nonetheless a good representation of the typical 'rolled rogue because FoTM, but actually sh\_t at playing rogue' player
---
For BGs it always depends on the typical: how many, what classes are involved and at which location - to make a guess at who's side is going to walk out of that fight - and how many of them will be still alive to tell the tale
---
For world pvp it's all about who gets the drop on who. While a couple of pairings will be able to fight back it goes without saying that literally everyone is screwed if a hunter opens up from max range on you. You can't run away, you will never reach him/her if both put the same amount of engi-toys, potions or global gizmos into the fight
---
Then again a simple 1v1 in world pvp is not exactly something that stays a 1v1 for long on servers with a healthy population.
---
I gotta say I healed a lot in classic and I never enjoyed healing a guardian druid. DMG is just unpredictable and non linear. It's a gamble. They don't even had "oh shit" buttons if my memory serves me right.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
yeah its fury , i need to ask if anyone has videos of fury mob farming i want to see what it plays like. I doubt we will see much fury tanking before late bwl though 
---
Good thing you read the actual post...
---
When I was 11-13 playing Classic WoW, I didn't think that 14 years later I'd be turning 26 - anticipating the release of the same game I was playing then. Amazing.
---
Damn, seems everyone and their relatives are going to roll a warlock :ponder: I can't complain though, moar HS and summons 🥰
---
Right so as a rule of thumb for offensive spells with a cast time they dont want you pumping out full spell power scaling on a rank1 frostbolt, but your lowest level frostbolt that has the max cast time will scale because you are downranking for mana and not for cast time (which would increase dps without the reduced scaling in some cases). I suppose instant casts follow rules similar to the posts above.
---
When I first heard about private servers, I thought that sounds awesome, and then I thought maybe I'm just feeling nostalgic, then I tried playing on them. There was certainly an element of nostalgia in my enthusiasm to try playing, but once I got into it, I realized that the game was simply better than, more fun to play.
---
I met some cool people in WoW, turned out they lived in an entirely different country. Needless to say, I've never spoken to them since :)
---
This means it can be traded for and so wouldn't make his list, by that standard all enchants in the game are exclusive and not tradeable, just to name a hundred.
---
A really great video if you don't mind getting into some deeper psychology stuff
---
We used to bring pugs into our heroics in tbc.  Overgeared spriest tanking and my op holy priest healing.  The ones that didn't drop before we started got to see a show. 
---
Why on earth would we think you could want an Alliance bookmark? :O
---
But there's a big difference between mithril spurs and weapon chain. Blacksmith keys can be traded does that mean they should removed from the list?
---
So if weapon chain is considered usable on other people therefore not place able on this list all the keys should be removed. As you can use them to open other people's boxes/doors therefore you don't need to be a blacksmith to get use out of a key.
---
This list is either counter intuitive, or wrong. Either way that's fine, but enchants aren't an item which is what this list is asking about
---
Skinning is decent especially at the start. Some tailoring recipes do use leather and also you can sell the leather to a vendor to help with gold for a mount. You can always grab enchanting later. I’d mail most of the greens you make to a bank alt or a friend.
---
Enchanting usually goes good with tailor. 
---
I'm a big fan of MadSeasonShow, and this is one of his best opinion pieces to date.
---
It's like the examples he used of Mario 64 or whatever. I LOVE Jet Set Radio, I break it out once a year and do a full playthrough. I love the concept, the art, the graphical style, and the music. They remastered it on Xbox 360 a few years ago and it's fun, but it's not the game I love. It looks pretty, but the controls are clunkier and not as fluid as the Dreamcast controller, and they couldn't relicense the entire original soundtrack (though to give Sega credit, they did get like 90% of it). I had a roommate question me about it, as he saw the 360 version in my digital library while playing. He didnt get why I would play the "uglier game" and that it was just nostalgia. Alright dude, if you say so.
---
Sure thing bud! This one's actually easier than shaman v priest. 
---
Okay, first things first. How do you feel about healing?
---
Shadow priest and hunter are great and fun PvP classes with good survivability. Neither is that gear-dependant and can destroy several opponents alone
---
Do you care about pve, atleast a bit? I would go shaman and make it an end goal to get sulfuras :)
---
Are you EU or NA or something else?
---
PvP servers are just like pve servers but with added danger and the possibility for awesome massive world pvp!
---
No one thats actually good at the game will make fun of your lack of knowledge btw just saying.
---
People that are cocky are usually average at best.
---
Remember all the best gear for pvp is found in raids (aside from rank 13/14 but naxx gear beats that) so even pvpers raid :)
---
Aye but enhancement shaman is really an awkward PvP class, as it can be kited so easily, and if you dont get that wf proc at first, youre just waiting 4 seconds for your next swing and pray.
---
Existing communities seems very friendly. Never saw a case where someone would be discriminating due to his/her longer pserver/vanilla years played count. Super-hardcore players don't bother with bragging too, they just play a game they enjoy.
---
It's more likely to hear what Classic should be or not from other people that don't actively participate in the vanilla hype or pservers. I've already read on EU forums that addon users are cheaters, mass PvP organizers should be banned while participants force-sharded and raiders or people that level faster are "toxic elitists" and all could just go back to private servers. Because #saveplayerone . 
---
Yes and no, they can be kited but you can also use professions to help your downfalls. Speed potions, rocket helm, grenades....I only suggest shaman&gt;hunter because shaman offers more flexibility as a main character, healing and dps. If you aren’t 100% hunter you might not like them later on in classic and have to make another character anyway
---
Just pick one and stick with it to max no matter what.
---
Vanilla classes are designed so each is unique and brings something different to the table. Jealousy os inevitable so you pick one and stick with it.
---
It’s so weird to assume an “updated” art style is better, why not just an alternative? A game is its own entity when it releases, nobody’s thinking “I can’t wait to play the remastered version in the future when I can actually enjoy the graphics!” And do people express this about different media too I’m honestly not sure? Does anyone give fans of the original Star Trek a hard time for still loving a series with such dated “graphics?” Maybe that’s a bad analogy
---
Why is 6-10 so hard? It was frustrating 
---
All very good choices for virtually any situation. Human tanks are the vest for threat and nelf os best for tankiness but the differences are negligable
---
You must be present at all times to use blacksmithing keys, meaning they are useless when traded for unless it's to another blacksmith. Weapon chains are the exact same as enchants but you deny enchants (inc saying they occupy an inventory spot and that is when I throw up in my mouth at that level of semantics).
---
Yo thanks a lot man this looks great! :)
---
THE RET GANG WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU
---
It's not strictly BoP policy but you have to be a herbalist to use the herb knife from ZG to have chances for bloodvine, Skinning weapons to skin The beast, some silithids and draconids/Onyxia or mining with an enchant or mining helmet to mine Anubisats in AQ20/40. Profession  + special tool to unlock some feature.
---
Right, im just so used to these days when u can get good gear in so many different ways, the time frame i played the most was during mists where u do one or the other on a character
---
[O_O](https://images.app.goo.gl/WaJ4Gw4JB7NiWugs9) 
---
And with an even deeper appreciation 
---
Maybe like a mental gank, where you pace around your target, fully visible, maybe a single auto-attack that won’t kill them, but drain their HP a little bit. They start running towards where they think safety is, and you keep chasing them, giving another auto-attack to shave their HP down little by little.
---
Then, before they reach the threshold to safety, you finish them off with a strong ability, then you’ll be on your way.
---
That can be pretty ganky.
---
Why can't I raid - Sharm
---
Isnt carrot on a stick obtained from zul’farrak quest?

Hummm... I thought I’d write a line or two. Sorry for the wall XD.
---
Vanilla (or TBC, I’m a PvP focused guy so I prefered TBC) was/were the best MMO to date and nothing will ever beat these. 
---
Why? It’s simple. Every MMO releases now work more or less like retail and are built for dummies... They are made to appeal to brainless kids who want am easy adventure while collecting gear that has no impact on their progression.
---
Take ESO, for example, which is the best alternative to Wow for now. It feels like an action RPG and the fast pace of the game takes the strategy out of the game. It’s more of an action/reaction game rather than a Startegically hard/complex game. Just do the same mashing button combo in PvP and you will win.
---
Wow is a mix between strategy and reaction. You need to choose what to do and when to do it. Do I have time to cast a fireball or not? Should I pull this mob or not? Should I, should I, should I? You’re constantly asking yourself which is the best thing to do in certain situations. That’s what makes the game fun.
---
Also, class identity was kept in the game. Now, every MMO that comes out creates classes that can self-sustain healing-wise and that is probably the worst part of any MMO. If you can self-sustain, why would you want to group up/make friends...? You don’t need others to progress, it’s lame.
---
Wow is and will be/remain the best MMO ever made because I don’t think any company will ever dare create an MMO with classes that don’t sustain because the hardcore community for these kind of game probably come from Dungeon and Dragon pen and paper back in the 1990s... Kids these days would never understand why Wow was such a good game.
---
This is so wholesome. I can't wait to go home.
---
I would've said herb but you have a buddy doing that, so skinning. Vendor the low level skins, AH the better ones. Easy gold.
---
Enchanting will cost you a fortune and you don't *need* it.

FeelsAustralianMan
---
and you probably didn't viper sting once.
---
Yeah, it's kind of a pain to get too, and I felt like its such a well known item - I didnt even know the Azure Silk Belt existed until recently, for example. 
---
You understand that as an item it is meaningless without a blacksmith right? It only gains any value when applied by a blacksmith. Enchants are drastically different as they can't be traded, they aren't an item. You can get assholish about semantics but when making a list about specific items semantics are important.
---
If I say all created gear should be on here and you go no because etc I can say that's just semantics. Which it is, because semantics is the nitpicky of the interpretation of something and it's meaning. Which is what this post about, so if you are gonna get snarky then gfy.
---
Now continuing on, the enchanting trinket should not be included on this list according to you since "you must be present/blacksmith" etc bullshit. Which is wrong... but let's say it is. You can spec out of enchanting immediately and still use the trinket to full affect. It isn't an enchanting required item.
---
Lastly to prove your key thing wrong. If you open a lockbox you essentially enchanted that item to now be open. The receiver of the opening never sees the key but gains the benefit. So keys are very clearly similar... in order to get any enchant an enchanter just be present the whole time they cast the enchant, but afterwards the receiver gains full benefit. Something like opening DM doors, or lock boxes the BS spends the same amount of time as an enchanter and leaves a lasting affect that OTHER OTHER OTHER people can use and benefit from. Which makes them not required by everyone to get the benefit therefore they don't belong according to your bullshit logic. (Inb4 but keys are shorter term benefits than enchants. Lol... just lol mate]

Solo mara/dm seemed very tricky

---
I believe instant casts are treated the same as a 1.5 second cast time for calculating spell power. But if it's also an aoe spell then it gets reduced again by 1/3. 
---
Holy shit, FF7 and Goldeneye did not look that bad, this can't be real!!!
---
Man has time flown apparently.
---
Also the OP said items, and enchants aren't items so to claim that they are is just stupid. As well saying "this thing that isn't an item is an item, and if you try to correct me by using the definition of an item I'll throw up" shows your inability to actually debate something and your childish antics. 
---
I ran tbc, wrath and possibly some of the end of vanilla in Linux and it ran great.  In some patch cycles considerably better than in windows.  I also ran legion mostly in Linux with little issue and comparable performance.  You should be fine. Winehq is your go to website. 
---
Don’t think I’ve seen people like that. I was 3 years old when vanilla rolled around and now I can barely contain my excitement of getting ganked in duskwood
---
You have no pants though :o
---
How are they in mass pvp lile AV?
---
A good analogy might be paintings. 
---
Medieval paintings with their weird faces and stretched limbs are not worse than the Mona Lisa, they are just different. 
---

---
Bosch's depiction of hell is awesome, yet it's nowhere near as realistic as the Mona Lisa, still I prefer looking at Bosch's paintings.
---
I stopped playing after wotlk, my daughter was just born now I also have a son. Raiding would be out of the question. Maybe I’ll teach them how to fish though...
---
I think accountability is really important. Sure it would be fun to go hardcore at the release but I have a family to take care of and a full time job. I also recognize how important it is to manage my physical and mental health. I don't think I would have been able to prioritize these things 15 years ago but today I am confident that I can. 
---
Yep most guilds just want to fill the 40man so they wont be too picky tho memespecs are still meme
---
What I like is that this cool shit still found its way to the plebs. 
---
\+30sp, titanic leggings, lionheart helm, Teebus. All can be acquired by someone never running a raid once.
---
So a dungeon player can still get quite decent gear.
---
Did this in one of the dungeons in legion where you went off a waterfall before one of the bosses.  
---
&gt;Yes its different teams, but there is still a fair bit of interaction between retail and classic
---
Keep in mind [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;t=19m37s) of the Blizzcon panel does literally say
---
&gt;World of Warcraft: Classic is not a small side-project. This is a fully integrated effort, it has the full support of the World of Warcraft team. 
---
Its messy business trying to guess what resources are going where from the outside, but between the code and database expertise, the tools, the UI changes, it would be perhaps a little silly not to tap their existing team on an as-needed basis for various things given the way they're handling the process. 
---
U think hpallies are in bigger need?
---
Nice post! WF is so fun tho!!!  
---
Yeah while there are many fury and rogues there are also more raid slots for them cuz they should be top dps
---
Hunters are amazing. At everything. Don't worry, do what you're interested in! Don't stress the little stuff. Classes are not balanced perfectly, but considering that, hunters do very well
---
Omg I had this, for some reason I could never toggle walking with it (either the button broke or there was no button and it covered all the walk toggle keys). I was so upset even though I wasn’t on a RP server at the time. I just wanted to stroll 
---
Wait, for real? When did they nerf Raf? That buries any last glimpse of me leveling up a toon in retail. 
---
Custom /e emotes were never readable by the other faction in classic. It was always replaced with the "strange gestures" phrase.
---
Built in /emotes such as /no /ty and /lol were translated for the other faction.
---
I work from home 40-60% for the past 8 years. Its called distance/flexible work here  and its been proven that employees actually go the extra mile to keep it. And it lowers sickdays too.
---
Naah, the reasons they are better are, they have better aoe threat. Ppl tend to aoe and if the tank can actually keep all the mobs on him, easier healing, more focused dps. Druid has High HP -&gt; it gives the healer options to be efficient while healing because you arent in a emergency mode all the time. And he/she has innervate for the healer, aka you can chainpull until end of the instance. Especially nice, if you are a priest.
---
U think priest matters more on h or a?
---
The buff speed last 30s, you have 3 charges for a total of 1min30s.
---
Let's assume 3 minutes boss fights, we need 2 pummelers per boss.
---
10 bosses in MC, so we need a total of 20 pummelers.
---
5 instances reset per hour, 4 hours needed to farm just the pummelers for ONE raid.
---
And you still haven't farmed the other comps you need for raiding and you still have shit DPS on trash mobs.
---
No thank you.
---

West Coast of what? 
---
youre really judgemental arent you?
---
Warlocks are generally 4th
---
Hunters too sometimes but mainly preaq
---
Eh i guess i should of worded it better, Annoying would be a better word rather than Hard.
---
Warlock has no insta tag spells so its harder than others to get mob tags
---
Warrior  doesnt have Hamstring so it can't kite mobs and all you do is Heroic Strike + Auto, rend doesnt do enough 
---
Hunters don't have pets so you have to stutter step a lot for maximum auto shots, and if you're in a cave you are cactus.
---
Mages are the only easy mode. since you just FB spam and finish with a Fireblast
---
Rogues are gimped without their off hand and only having 1 dagger you do even less, have to gouge backstab as much as you can since SS just pisses energy and does jack all damage.
---
Shamans and pallys are pretty easy also at this level since you can pull multiple mobs and just auto attack with seals/rock biter and rank 1 heals.
---
Priests are awful here as MB burns a lot of mana with SW:P
---
( note the casters are taking into account no wands )

Have you considered writing this as a drama friday story to Preachgaming?

[I present to you the manual of war.](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903) 
---
Yah but rogues also care much for their class tiers so that limits competition. Same for priests and hunters.
---
Most warlock mage fury tier pieces arent bis for pve so they all fight for nontier
---
I played Horde on a PvP server and a friend played alliance. I helped him with a quest and we were talking in his guild's teamspeak. I didn't know anyone in his guild.
---
After the quest was over I stayed in his teamspeak channel and went afk while he and other guildies did other quests in STV.
---
I stalked them on my druid (different character my friend didn't know) and started ganking them all. Rinse and repeat x5. 
---
I could hear them swearing and calling in others to help them kill this asshole. I kept my silence. They thought it was ridiculous how this druid kept finding them and evading them. This continues for about 20 more minutes.
---
I introduced myself in teamspeak. Great prank. they were all quiet, but I did get a few laughs. I'm sure some of them hate me still.

what is the most effective specc to level a paladin and which other speccs are at least viable?

Shadow eh I’ll look into that, thanks!

Played warlock in beta and beginning vanilla.  Definitely despawned after 15 minutes.  I don't remember at what point that changed though as I stopped playing lock long before 60.

Alternatively ally warlock for dps

Raids are were you work to gear for PvP.  BGs and World PvP is where you show off your hard won raid gear.
---
**&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt; \[Horde\]** World PvP &amp; Semi-hardcore PvE | **EU** (mostly)/(NA)
---
**Introduction:** If you’re looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you’re a PvE raider who’s looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you’re at the right place.Everyone earns their roles here, whether they’re Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
**What we expect of members:**
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids (once a week).
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot.
---
**Guides:** A thorough introductory guide to structured World-PvP to show you how we get things done.[https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903)

Good luck finding a pally that heals others.  They're pretty rare.  Alliance would be the best PvP faction if pallys healed in random BGs.  Now if we're talking pre-mades where the pallys heal, then yes the alliance is better.
---
Yep! Between feral tank Druid and warrior...
---
Still not decided yet!
---
Same question for professions...
---
Well in the case of Jet Set Radio, the game is all cel shading like Borderlands. So it was really a matter of increasing the resolution. I agree that the remaster does look good, but it's the gameplay aspects that draw me to the original. 
---
You slow groups with traps and snipe out healers/clothies. Mages are godly in mass PvP, but hunter is second.
---
Even if you a pretty much set for live with your 6/6 pieces for some classes like warriors, you still want rings, trinkets, neckpiece, bracers, belt and back, so you will have to raid if you plan on being the most dominant PvPer.

Are just a few blacksmithing off the top of my head
---
They cannot "keep" it. They are not modifying retail data to produce Classic. They use Vanilla 1.12 data.
---
Been playing warrior from day one of me wow career! I didnt play wow for quite some time now ,but when they announced classic i already made up my mind and not lost one minute sleep over it so far.
---
Gonna tank al the way again,and probarly a mage alt for grinding mats. If you cant choose then dont,just level al three of them and see what you like more in the end. 😊
---
You will most likely just install the Classic Client which will install into a _classic_ folder. You’ll also be able to download Retail and PTR as well if you want, but won’t need to, which would install into separate _ptr_ and _retail_ folders.
---
So you'll tank either way? Thank you for your service lol
---
At least professions are a no-brainer for me. I enjoy pvp and engineering is just way to useful to pass it up.
---
Dont forget to breathe, buddy
---
You should check out the official WoW forums sometime. Just skimming the front page of any "classic wow" type thread on the general forums gives me a headache
---
The only thing I regret about rolling a hunter is that I leveled 3 60s before I rolled a hunter.  
---
"being an item" was not his only criteria, and I could tell you were going to be vitriolic from the start. Also if we want to get pedantic:
---
noun
---
plural noun: items
---
    an individual article or unit, especially one that is part of a list, collection, or set.
---
    "the items on the agenda"
---
    synonyms:	thing, article, object, unit, module, artifact, piece, commodity, product, bit; More
---
    element, constituent, component, ingredient
---

So here is how this works, you try not to pretend every last bone in your body isn't pure cold calculated autism, and I try not to mute you for being a manipulative liar pretending the OP made his post in written in blood ink and sealed with his soul. If he corrects me that's fine, excuse me for interpreting his words to mean exclusive "within reason" and not taking your 100% literal quoting of him about a 15 year old game.
---
In the context of spell ranks, would a lvl 1 curse of agony that costs 30 mana benefit 100% from spell power?
---
Oh I definitely plan to eventually level them all to 60! Heck, I'd be down to level *every* class to 60 - that's the beauty of Classic, we're not in a rush this time around.
---
However I do need to focus on one class for the first 3 months or so. I have a bad history of altism, I'd just level every class to 30 and then start all over If I don't restrict myself.
---
Played all vanilla as a priest and I've always had these "must be nice being a mage" thoughts.. but never rerolled.
---
I'm gonna be a mage this time. :D
---
Are you going to duo lvl mostly? If not, herb would be a great supplement for your friend to level alch faster and have more potions for both of you and AH.
---
Else any other gathering of your choice, either skinning, which is easier to use, or mining, if you like hunting for veins.
---
*Don't shit where you eat*
---
Do you consider 24 hours to be a few hours ? :D
---
Unless you want to be server first I don't think there is a major difference, I would say about 12 hours. However it's a guess, I don't have any data to back it up.
---
Same exact experience. 
---
&gt; Just fucking be a friend.
---
Gotcha
---
My first character that I commited time to, was an Undead Rogue that I leveled to about 40, I got tired of farming gold for the mount and just wandered in Ashenvale and Hillsbrad. I ganked low level but higher leveled characters also. It was one of the best time of my gaming-life fun-wise. 
---
Hoping this isn’t a bait thread, but as cool as it would be to have this in Classic it’s simply not in the reference 1.12 client they are building Classic off of. They would have to manually add that in. I don’t suspect this is something they’ve been thinking about, though if enough people began talking about it that might put it on their radar.
---
What's up with all these people making the combined crests of Alliance/Horde or rocking a computer rig with both colors etc? Pick one. 
---
Double spacebar, that's rare.
---
Never rolled a hunter to 60 myself but I played a lot with a friend‘s hunter when he couldn‘t attend raids or farm BGs himself. Must say I had a lot of fun and it was refreshing compared to my usually-healer mains. 
---
If I had to choose a DD class hunter would what I‘d go for. But I‘ll roll healer again anyway, screw me. 
---
14 years ago I created a Human Mage. He is still my main. He has always been my main. He will always be my main.
---
I’m looking forward to my main getting his true character model back in Classic. 
---
This is easy. Roll a Mage. 
---
&gt;need the profession to get and/or to fully benefit from
---
 Quoting the op there, I'll repeat for dramatic effect. need the profession to get and/or to fully benefit from  need the profession to get and/or to fully benefit from  
---
Do you need the blacksmithing prof to gain a weaponchain or fully benefit from it? You see his list was essentially "which items can I not buy my way into and actually require me to maintain my crafting skills if I want to be able to use them on demand". This list doesn't include flasks because you can buy them, keys require you to be a blacksmith at the moment of usage. Bandages could be on that list, you can't use them without the skill at the very moment you need them. Your strawman was stupid from the start because you wanted the list to be "these items require x skill to use" in *certain* circumstances. So about that "inability to actually debate something and your childish antics"?
---
Are you actually an idiot? You are saying "that wasn't his only criteria" and then proceed to blatantly ignore it as the first and primary criteria he states. Like sure you can use a google definition to get really pedantic but claiming im the vitriolic one as you throw insult after insult and use offensive slurs. I bet whenever a player says they can't melee you say "bro melee just means a skirmish hunters melee too. Melee just means to fight" like yeah google definition whatever you want you look fucking stupid when it comes to what it means in game. That's fine if you want to ignore the lingo, or being really anal specific about it. But an item in wow is defined as something that can go into your bags, or be searched on item list. Enchants are spells *gasp* I know you just got triggered reading that. And dont apply to this list which is defined as ITEMS.
---
This is easy. Roll a Human Mage. 
---
!remindme 90 days
---
First off, he says primary professions so bandages can't be on that list. Thank you for showing you clearly can't read or comprehend words that are in front of you. 
---
My pleasure!
---
Good choice for the professions! I think I’ll go mining engineering if I roll warrior, enchanting/skinning if I roll Druid as engineering is less useful for druids as you mainly need to demorph 
---
&gt;  I'll prepare for each of these choices and 5 minutes before the servers go live, I'll go to https://wheeldecide.com and let fate decide.
---
How many times are you prepared to re-spin?
---
bear druid is for tank!
---
I said I would throw up in my mouth and then you started insulting first, so you might say I threw the first stone but you actually started the insults were pulling the same overly literal exhausting arguments that I had to disprove with my post previous post with the quote. Those debate skills are failing again. 
---
 need the profession to get and/or to fully benefit from
---
Secondly you can get weapon chains or bloodvine  without their respective professions. But if you want to benefit from a weapon chain you need a blacksmith. You can buy keys and get them, but if you want to benefit from them you need a blacksmith. How is that hard for you to comprehend? You can pay a blacksmith to open shit for you, you don't need to be a black Smith to get shit open.
---
Lastly would you argue that rods such as copper, silver, etc used for enchanting shouldn't be on that list despite needing enchanting to get any use of them?
---
After 2 weeks LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Yes and please prove to me how someone without blacksmithing can benefit from a weapon chain in their bag? And if you say you can get it on your weapon without giving it to a blacksmith or learning the skill required you are an idiot. 
---
With auto attack...
---
Thanks. I was 12 when I started classic back in the day so I cannot really rely on my own experience. But I probably need like 2 months for 60 anyway - I guess one week more or less will then be irrelevant. 
---
I absolutely hate it, but I’ve play pve server since vanilla and don’t wanna miss out this time
---
The doubts will come back the first time you see someone from the other classes ;)
---
I'm going Druid to be everything! Me, my GF and our friends are like a good mix of DPS, healers and tanks. So I'm going Druid to switch people off a bit with everything, so one person doesn't always have to tank or heal etc ^^,
---
I'm not 100% sure about that one, but I don't think it does get the full bonus. But now I'm curious. I haven't done much warlock theory crafting. 
---
You are cornered, talking shit about my reading comprehension over "primary professions, hah just tipped my fedora on him". Which is ironic given you are now spiraling into semantics, see below.
---
&gt; But if you want to benefit from a weapon chain you need a blacksmith 
---
He didn't ask if there are weapons chains that exist without blacksmiths, he was asking if HE personally needs to be a blacksmith if he wants to ... and here comes the same quote for the third time to get it through your head.
---
&gt; **you** need the profession to get and/or to ***fully benefit from***
---
Nowhere in that question is he asking if somewhere in the universe does **any** blacksmith have to exist for him to get his weapon chain. This dude just wanted to know if he can buy blacksmithing keys(and use them) without being a blacksmith, or if he would have to have it at all times like an engineer with certain items, and you had to make it complicated. Shame on you, this is stupid. If you want to keep this going I am just going to clip from the earlier posts and place them in order and context and show you where you fucked up.(if I feel like going through the trouble)
---
A ret embracing his role in a medium skilled group is good enough really. 
---
Cleanse the shit out of your warrior, give him BoF and you should be good to go throw in couple heals. 
---
In prems holies are top dog, but roaming around the world wPvPing a retarding will do well enough if he supports his warrior properly.
---
If you keep your gear up to date, especially weapon, Warriors can even be quicker to lvl up.
---
Strawmanning the OP's question.
---
yeah, before level cap, world pvp is usually just about one person opening on someone who's half health/mana, and both players don't even have their full kits. and to me, that's boring as hell. 
---
and because all the recent pservers are pvp servers, i had to deal with low level world pvp all the time. usually, if someone started attacking me, i would just get up and get a glass of water or something and let them mindlessly attack me. no point in fighting back if it isn't going to be fun for me, and it meant i could get back to leveling faster, or they might just stop attacking me because it isn't fun for them either.
---
but at level cap, wpvp is usually more team-based, or about fighting over resources with both players starting out healthy, etc. it's way more engaging and interesting. and for that reason, i'll probably roll on a pvp server anyway, or at least put my vote in for a pvp server since i'll be playing with friends. it's worth the few hours i'd be delayed over the course of 20-60 due to being ganked.
---
Just make one paladin friend as warrior and queue as 2. One warrior and one paladin can break most BGs singlehandedly.
---
Yeah, mana burn has 30yard range, heals have 41.   
---
Does shadow reach increase mana burn range?   
---
You'd still be out of range and the paladin sits behind his warrior spam cleansing and healing.
---
It would be the true vanilla experience that they wanted to give us, but not the fauly ruined experience they delivered.
---
So do you believe jumper cables should be on this list or do you believe that paying people to come and use them on you satisfies his "I don't need to be an engineer to get rezzed by them" mentality you have projected on him?
---
Frankly I wouldn't consider the speed leveling of a class. Since you already have played Vanilla you're going to spend max 10 days played to reach 60, but you will spend many many more time at 60. So choose a class you will enjoy, even if it's a bit harder to lvl.
---
Oh they absolutely will, won't they?
---
It can't be helped I guess.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Curse you vanilla design team, for making more than 1 fun class!
---
Phasing is most likely the reason for that. 
---
Nah, I dont even thing we played on the same server. You guys was on Warsong correct? I was on Emerald Dream. I just remember seeing his posts on the warrior forum about how amazing daggers was.
---
I only started playing wow in december 2017. Im currently on a tbc server and I can say without my rose tinted glasses that this is the better product. its a bit rough around the edges but the leveling experience has been 100 times more fun than retail
---
Also the toxic Europeans will be stuck on their own servers.
---
Tankx was a good pal of mine pre-BC before I stopped playing.  Hope to see him again!
---
It wasnt directed at you but more a general statement for anyone planning to lvl a warrior in classic.
---
I play as a priest right now and the only time I use it is for farming Dire Mail lashers and for world PvP when heavy aoe is needed. I seldom use it in 5 Mans because it costs too much mana, and the groups I run with usually try to speed run everything so I can’t drink after every pull.  I never use it in raids except for maybe panther boss in ZG. 
---
You'll love hunter if you enjoy the following:
---
- Kiting
---
- Being tranq-bot
---
- Being the worst DPS class.
---
Wut
---
Absolutely based

#THEY CANNOT "KEEP" IT. THEY ARE NOT MODIFYING RETAIL DATA TO PRODUCE CLASSIC. THEY USE VANILLA 1.12 DATA.
---
Love this guys vids, may it be his tone or the way he edits everything together. Just always enjoyable.
---
__They cannot "keep" it. They are not modifying retail data to produce Classic. They use Vanilla 1.12 data.__
---
As a paladin?
---
Not challenging at all. 
---
Paladin is designed to be easy accesable. 
---
The downside is, if you mastered healing, there will be no difference between you and any other paladin on the server. 
---
Yes! Go for it! 
---
Try to buy the warden staff if possible.
---
Go enchanting to craft the heart of the mountain
---
Grab everything leather with stamina and everything that brings additional armor and agi.
---
Your threat level will be fine.
---
Priest is really smooth to level and quite fast. You have next to no downtime, provided you look out for reasonable wand upgrades and just wand your enemies to death once they hit ~40% HP. This will let your mana regen kick in soon enough so that you'll never really have sit/drink.
---
You don't have to level as holy - regardless of spec you're fine healing at least until the early 50's. Putting your first five talent points in +wand damage and the next five in spirit tap is pretty much a must for smooth leveling, after that it comes down to personal preference. Most would suggest staying in shadow or at least switch to shadow once you can obtain shadow form. But again, that's personal preference IMO.
---
For me it was level 42 because of ”Widowmaker” dagger. 
---
Global the clothies, feels good. 
---
I chuckle when stuff like this happens because it further proves horde are never mature enough for an honorable duel (see dark souls for examples of honorable pvp etiquette) 
---
I had a hard time between 3 classes.
---
Rogue, Priest and Druid. 
---
Decided on Druid and I'm happier each day with the choice. Druid will help me accomplish my goals the most out of the 3 classes. 
---
I still might twink a Rogue for maximum nostalgia. 
---
Super comfy, like frostadamus
---
I did a bit of research and I'm quite certain on the shoulders you mentioned. Silk Mantle of Gamn is a quest reward from Wetlands and is many a caster's first pair of shoulders. I couldn't find a lot of white robes but I found a matching robe that is a random trash drop from Blackfathom Deeps, it's possible that your character ran this dungeon and got this beautiful robe. Together it looks like this: [https://www.wowhead.com/compare?items=2034:2913&amp;l=100](https://www.wowhead.com/compare?items=2034:2913&amp;l=100) you can view in 3D on wowhead to check if this is what your char looked like.
---
Holy Nova is both a weak and powerful spell.
---
It allows you to aoe farm to some extent like DM lasher.
---
It has his use in PvP for sure when you're fighting a melee and need an instant aoe heal to avoid interruption, rank 1 can be used to unstealth rogue,...
---
You'll never use it in raid because it is very mana inefficient, the rank 1 is pretty good but after that the mana cost skyrocket while the heal/damage stay very low.
---
In conclusion, it's a fun spell to have, I always take it with my priests cause it's always handy in pvp and for aoe farm without having to respect but from a raid minmaxing point of view it's useless.
---
Spell coefficient for Holy Nova is +-7% so having 500 spell power will only increase the damage by 35
---
Go priest, don’t do the same thing you did before. Maybe make a dwarf hunter alt. 
---
I was a night elf hunter in vanilla. I loved hunter. But I’m rolling orc shaman this go round and making a troll hunter alt. 
---
Plaguelands hands down. 
---
it will never be that ideal. its all nice theory and the theory is right, but reality has taught, that in 95% the hunter will die, no matter who gets to open the fight. also if the priest is undead he obviously has a harder time, but thats another story.
---
Hunters are good in pvp.
---
They tear through cloth, especially with a good pet.
---
You're responsibility is basically "hunters mark rogues, and dps their cloth wearing healer".
---
Yeah just feels as you're listening  to a buddy talk, during vanilla.
---
You should have inserted "main" in the meme and everyone would be cool with it.
---
And still are 
---
Vael
---
he could be just a desenchanter though.
---
Seems a comment of yours was deleted by yourself or someone else, I have it SS anyways and here it was, I put my reply below it. I am guessing you deleted it, it was a bad argument.
---
&gt;So do you believe jumper cables should be on this list or do you believe that paying people to come and use them on you satisfies his "I don't need to be an engineer to get rezzed by them" mentality you have projected on him?
---
So do you think the phrase "paladins can't have the staff of the shadowflame" is false because they can LITERALLY have one in their bags? Going back and reading, this all came from you strawmanning my original post. I have dealt with this before, someone says something in a laidback conversational style, and people like you come along and use "well akshually". This was all you not liking that I said you were wrong, so you took it to semantics to try and win there, but lost anyways when I just went back to read the post and see if you were even correct on the overly literal side, you weren't.
---
The evidence is in his own list, bloodvine **SET BONUS**. Keys that can be traded but the **spirit of trading them is lost** if you aren't also a blacksmith which is his question in the first place. Phil stone being **BOP**.
---
By all accounts this dude **isn't concerned about which items need to be traded in the enchanting window** of a trade function. And now that you lost the overly literal battle that you drug this down into when I quoted him, you want to go to this crap. Also, I love how I "projected my interpretation" on him but you didn't when you were the one being an autistic spaz who reads and comprehends like a contextless inhuman computer.
---
Jumper cables might be a funny exception because they require 2 players regardless of scenario, but the logic is more or less the same here because if he is concerned with how he wants to design his character, he most likely isn't planning on people around him having engineering and having jumper cables to use on his corpse. I would put it on the list because he needs engineering to have this in his personal arsenal.
---
Same thing applies to 6 demon bag, do YOU have to have the item when an enemy player can just cast it on you in a duel? You benefit from the pvp experience of it, semantics matter you said?
---
Do you need to loot the rare mounts in order to be able to view them being ridden, or can you just watch someone else ride them?
---
The last 2 questions are obviously just trolls using your stupid logic.
---
This Shaman speaks to me on so many levels, he comes with this message for all of those rolling Shammys in Classic;.....  "[STORM, EARTH AND FIRE - HEED MY CALL!](https://youtu.be/I3qwcxLIzvM)"  ♫  \\m/  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  \\m/  
---
Ive seen exactly this so god damn often over the years since even before classic was announced and people were begging for vanilla wow re release. 
---
Bunch of teens and low-20's kids bitching and moaning about a game they never even played
---
I believe Ret is the best to level based on kill times, with tanking and healing both being viable as well. Honestly a paladin being able to heal and dish out good damage in any spec makes it decent with leveling. 
---
Savage
---
You only really need tailoring once you reach lvl 60. 
---
You could go with the tried and true miner / skinner to get gold while levelling then respec once 60.
---
Fastest levelers can reach 60 under 4 days /played. I‘d say evetything under 5 days is good for hunters, druids and other fast classes. 
---
Looking at slow levers like wariors staying under 7( maybe 8) days is really good. This ofc is assuming a fresh server, Where you cant boost your char with gear, cant get WW-Axe before 35-40 and so on.
---
I don't like to use it, but the word "Untermensch" fits best for people like you, who enjoy an unfair fight. I'm gonna enjoy to cleanse STV of you guys.
---
They have the original code and database running internally. They use that old back up version to check with their new version whether or not something is working correctly.
---
I'm jus trolling heh. getting rdy for barrens.
---
Yeah constant 5-10k pops is ridiculous, even with dynamic spawns. Dynamic spawns work ok in the open world but when you clear a cave and mobs start randomly spawning on top of you and behind you, it's not fun.
---
Okay I think I misunderstood, you said competitive in mc/ony (as a healer) AND tanks well with feral instict, not that it is a competitive tank in mc/ony. This I can agree with.
---
Yeah, in 5mans you can get by without many feral points. But with talents you get much better, so much so I wouldn't really do end-game instances without at least 20-30 feral points unless overgeared simply because it is much more trouble than respeccing. Of course you can do it in an emergency, but you really miss out on a lot.
---
For example I've done a Sunken Temple as a 54 beartank with 2 level 60 DDs and still managed to keep threat. I would've struggled without that 30 point in feral. Same thing doing BRD or BRS before level 60. It's doable but not comfortable with that spec.
---
I was a warrior in vanilla and ive seen alot of polls that ppl will level a warrior and rogue. I dont want to play another mêlee class after all these years, so lock it will be.
---
Real friends don't make you play alliance though :o
---
Pretty much this, come to think of it, priest is probably the most flexible leveling after wand damage and ST. Most people rush shadow as it’s absolutely disgusting 
---
MOOSE YOU'RE THE BOMB, GO AWAY QUICK !!!!
---
;-)
---
holy nova is awesome. its your only instant cast so it comes in handy when fighting for a tag. it can be used to find rogues and even has some rare pve uses, vael for example. it scales like shit though.
---
Wasn't  shadow  useless  in Classic? I'd  love tp be a spriest too
---
I often fight outnumbered or vs lv 45-50 so I dont care about what you think is fair
---
DKs were from killing civilian NPCs IIRC. Low level players and NPC guards didn't give them, but most rankers didn't risk it with guards either way....since they're spawned by civilian NPCs who give DKs.
---
As for when they were implemented? I do not remember! It could have been with the honor system right off the bat, or maybe later....would need someone else to answer.
---
Yes Hunters suck. Please play Mage. :))
---
I think the main reason why WoW Vanilla / Classic nostalgia is demonized is mainly because of the MMO aspect but I want to add more here.
---
As MadSeasonShow pointed out, nobody cares if you fire up a 20+ year old single player game, good for you if you still like it.
---
WoW being an MMO and constantly evolving means for many that the game became better over the years with better mechanics and less bug and more learning from the devs, so it must be better.
---
Why would you play a 14 year old outdated version when the devs didn't know what they were doing ? 
---
People firstly forget that gaming, laugh at it or not, is an art form. It's not about which game has the latest graphics and features, it's not like deciding to buy a first generation smart phone or a latest one from 2019. It's highly subjective and it's fully dependent on the individual if it is good or not. You don't say that the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie was shit just because another 4 "expansions" came out over the years and Pirates 5 is the best version. Nobody will stop you from watching an old movie even if it was a trilogy or even more because it's art and it's your choice if you like it or not despite it's release date.
---
That's the first issue. The second one has to do with WoW constant changing nature as an online game. Single player games released 20+ years ago remain the same (unless a remastered version is released but that's neither here or there), you can't say anything against it because that was it's final state and will remain that way.
---
WoW doesn't do that. And the problem with nostalgia and liking older expansions is something I see mainly from people that play or played exclusively Retail, as in always played the up to date version. 
---
They never thought about private servers and the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of people still playing older expansions and Vanilla. They disregard the fact that this is an option just because private servers are not made by Blizzard and therefore should be ignored.
---
They really forgot what it was like to exist in Vanilla, BC, WoTLK and so on, they always went with the tide of new content and thought "Ah yes, this is a better version, better graphics, more mechanics, more spells and more classes, how can this not be better than older versions ?"
---
I'm not disputing if an expansion is or was indeed better than others, that's still subjective. I'm saying that because WoW is always changing and people don't play on private server, they can only accept the current version of WoW and shun those that want to play older versions.
---
I can guarantee that if Blizzard released Vanilla servers when BC came out, BC servers when WoTLK came out and so forth, nobody would shun anyone for choosing to play a certain expansion. But because they do exist but as private servers, somehow they don't count.
---
And even so it doesn't matter, just enjoy what you want to enjoy. I loved most expansions over the years and what they brought new to the game, new races, new classes, new spells, new zones and so on. But each expansion also had something more unique to it that can't be coded and put in as a mechanic and that is the community and the mentality that comes with the Expansion's (or Vanilla's) features.
---
I can't experience the same dungeon experience in current wow as I did in vanilla or BC, it's just not possible unless you look really hard for people that want the same experience, even then the dungeons are too easy to even care to try and replicate the feeling, constant changes to the game made sure that such an experience can't be replicated anymore. So why is it bad that I want to go into Classic and feel like I'm actually part of something when doing a dungeon ? That it's not just about the XP and the loot ? I want to fail and learn, I want to talk about random stuff with the random people I waited 45 minutes to make the group and reach the dungeon. I want to see people get excited at level 20 for a green drop. This is something that I can't have in current wow because the game itself doesn't allow such an experience to exist anymore.
---
It seems ohgeehaptix is making a few guides. I thought it's videos about WSG and Arathi were quite good (I never played in a premade so i can't be a good judge, but it made sense for me).
---
Re-speccing costs a lot (as you likely know,) and some players like to use one spec for multiple things. 
---
This, naturally leveling enchanting isn’t a bad idea. 
---
wut? its one of the best specs.
---
This looks like the work of a 9 year old. 
---
T H I C C    T E N D I E S
---
Ive  heard it was bad on videos  on YouTube  but idkk, Id lile to be shadow and then  heal on lvl 60
---
That is some count of monte cristo worthy revenge story.

Saw the video length was 10:07 and knew it could be padded out

&gt;I got a 39 twink rogue on a ps just to gank in stv

&gt;gank in stv

&gt;gank
---
Your words not mine.
---
then do it, most youtube videos are straight up bullshit.
---
Well I dont think you need to be overgeared, take DM:W for example, it's a pretty tough dungeon to tank for most tanks, but I found it very easy using the same gear I was pvping in to tank the dungeon, you get great threat on what would otherwise be loose casters, and with your high bear health your hp wont spike as much as it would had you had a warrior tank
---
One game i remember as looking lifelike was Tekken 3. The first game that really blow my mind. Seeing it now. Well yeah hehe. 
---
I detect certain levels of sarcasm in your words :D
---
I don’t think you understand. I haven’t accepted *my* fate. I’ve accepted *the* fate. I know not all women are like that, but as time goes on, more and more women will become like that. I know the nuclear family is not entirely dead yet, but it will be eventually.
---
You say I’m negative but actually I think it’s you who’s negative. I’ll quote Nietzsche on this one: “hope is the worst of all evils, because it increases the torments of man.” In other words, you’re not really an optimist, you’re a false optimist. On surface level you seem positive but ultimately you create more negativity in the long run because you refuse to accept reality. I don’t have life figured out, and neither do you!
---
Again, I am not negative. Only you think that. My life has improved since adopting this mindset. 
---
Are you aware of abrupt exponential climate change? We have maybe 30 years max until civilisation collapses. It’s best to be honest with people about this so they can reduce their suffering in future. 
---
F
---
You're wrong. In Classic boss fights are going to be a lot shorter with pushing threat being a lot more important than it was 15 years ago. On p-servers Fury/Prot Warriors are able to main tank right away due to world buffs and flasks. With these apparently not being as readily available in Classic as they are on private servers, we could end up in a situation with Druids being the defacto main tank for a lot of boss fights until a month or so after BWL is out when Fury/Prot Warrior threat really starts to scale well with T2.
---
So I deleted the comment because he specifies engineering and I thought this guy would get really anal if I left this comment. Now I love how all the items you list to prove me wrong don't have to do with professions. You shit talk claiming im using strawman then chain cast it yourself and go "dur steel weapon chain is the same thing as some one else using a mount" you around fucking stupid dude...
---
Also buying weapon chains off the ah does the same thing as buying keys off the ah, it's worthless without a player with the skill required.
---
Also claiming you dismantle my argument over and over again while avoiding it and creating bullshit ones and disproving those is what strawman is...
---
My actual argument: you don't need to be a blacksmith to get the full use of keys, if they are on the list OP probably would like weapon chain added. 
---
Your argument: you autistic [insert first pronoun that has negative connotation here]. Enchants are the same thing as weapon chain and if you tell me they aren't because they aren't items I'll throw up.
---
Me: okay you clearly aren't following the argument. 
---
You: wow im totally destroying this guy he just gave up to my totally amazing argument skillz.
---
Me: yeah man you got me. 
---
Since this is what you want... yeah man when you apply my argument to something that is not what I said and get really pedantic about using Webster definitions over in game terms. You are totally more of an ass than I am. Gratz.
---
Haha fair enough, you're like a film crew making a nature documentary and you don't want to interrupt natural selection 
---
This isn't what strawman means... you use that word a lot, I do not think it means what you think it means. 
---
Damn.. I remember being a lvl 6 gnome and was like WTF is that, lemme kill it! Well that didn't work out. That was one of the very first experiences I had with retail WoW and it felt epic. It got me hooked solely on the purpose of me one day killing that thing. So glad to see someone still has some screenshots from this.
---
They'd have to modify 1.12 data to add it. It wouldn't be a simple switch to flip.
---
I just feel like it's a very different type of game than modern wow. Back then nobody had a choice, so it makes sense that a lot of people who probably would have always liked modern style better feel like things have improved and it's only nostalgia that makes people want classic so much. 
---
But for me, it so happens that this type of game is the kind I prefer. I've leveled 4 characters to 60 on 1X private servers in the past few years. I'm pretty sure I like this game for more than just nostalgia reasons. But I don't think it's better or worse than modern mmos, it just has different objectives.
---
True enough, though you could also just mail BOE greens to a level 5 disenchanter while still having skinning on your main.
---
Maybe you should have just learned the fights, to be able to predict incoming damage?
---
If you think healing a Feral Druid is bad and you plan to heal during Classic, you're going to be having a heart attack the first time you have to heal a Warrior without a shield on and Death Wish up. 
---
I wouldn't call it useless, but its subpar in a raiding environment. There's nothing wrong though with leveling as shadow or melting faces in pvp. 
---
- scroll up is the best interupt key
---
- mouse buttons are good for instant casts
---
- A and D are for striving
---
- ~ Left of 1 gets forgotten alot
---
- Z, X, C are overrated
---
- S is backpaddle, shift-S is a deffence
---
- Most used spells should be 1, 2, 3, Q, E
---
- Shift-F is always mount
---
- Shift-C is character panel
---
- B is open all bags. Opening a single bag is silly
---
&gt;but I found it very easy using the same gear I was pvping
---
Depends on what kind of PvP gear it is. Is that the blue pvp set late in the patch cycle? That is  much stronger than the default high level green/lower level blue items characters wear when gearing up in DM.
---
Especially since pvp gear tends to have armor and stamina, exactly what a bear needs.
---
Not rude, and I agree with everything you wrote.  The dichotomy is still amusing.
---
This guy knows
---
Great vid from my fave druid! Looking forward to more.
---
Nostalgia is poison.  It's a stultifying, corrosive force that warps art and cages artists.  It convinces you that things were better than they were and things are different now.  It lies.
---
Nostalgia is poison.  So is alcohol, and I have a nice glass of single malt every night.  Having a little is fine.  Just do so in moderation.
---
This is how I have been recruited &lt;3
---
Rank 14. Had no idea he was hardcore... hmm
---
The best raiding guilds will always be found on PvP servers so you will be fine
---
In /played most people will be 60 in between 8 and 12 days depending on class and knowlage.
---
Those who "rush" will be 60 in between 6 and 8 days.
---
Those who "rush" and know what they are doing will be 60 in 4-6 days.
---
There will be no new world record at start. But in 3-4 months people will get a new world record with some gold assistance from there main.
---
Around 30% of the people will main a new char after there char is above 30.
---
It will take 4 months on an active server before the first succesfull MC pug raid.
---
Ragnaros will be death within 4 weeks of release.
---
These are all random guesses based on nothing :)
---
I'm Triggered
---
The warlock hat isn't a reward from a long chain. You get a quest to pick a flower in Duskwood and in Wetlands, you bring them to SW and use it to get a guy drunk. Then you run back to warlock trainer and get the hat. You just made it long because you didn't know where to go lol.
---
Can you really duel the opposite faction? 
---
There is a nicely geared rogue in a pserver I play with nickname 'Evilscum' who ganks people, even lvl 60s in Stormwind. It's absolutely terrible.
---
Any time you're exercising your back and core you want to focus on jerking, twisting motions. If you feel sharp pain, continue that exercise more vigorously to condition your body.
---
Technically we can use 2 shards. One for EK and one for Kalimdor.
---
Good stuff :)
---
Best players in general tbf. 
---
Jesus Christ I'm the opposite rn on pserver haha
---
Sweet summer child...
---
You claimed the persons ability to do dungeons and raid were stopped by this mute.
---
Its factually NOT stopped. And of course you cant speak in public chat, thats the POINT. But it does not stop you from playing the game. Youll be just fine if someone invites you to a group or raid. Youll even be able to speak. But you can only PM friends.
---
Like I said, you tried to make this sound scary, as if it would impede your ability to play the game completely and thats a damn lie.
---
Haha think he was trying to sidestep the frostbolt :D
---
As long as you're at least full blue gear, grinding on an arms or fury warrior is very efficient. You rarely have to regen (assuming non elite mobs ofc).
---
It was the same cost in tbc but gold was far more valuable. I’d say the 5k flying in early tbc was easier to get than the 1k gold mount in vanilla, for some perspective. There’s no dailies in vanilla remember, so you can’t just go and collect 70g a day in 30mins.
---
This is one of the reasons I'm considering going paladin. 0 interest in dosing. Holy/prot bg breaker
---
I assume you never played any Vanilla since game evolved to TBC back in the day. 
---
Basically what you are saying is that people like me who have played it frequently along 10 years to stop using our brains and pretend we are dumb and didnt learn anything during our play time. Clever Mr.Clever. 
---
I have always tried other MMOs and enjoyed then only MMO I really hated was ESO, but none of them stuck with me and I was constantly a nomad. Then came FFXIV I loved it to death especially 2.0 but from stormblood onwards again ultra casualization has begun and it's too much hand holding. The raids in 2.0 where glorious and the entire world content was fantastic.
---
So now I await patiently for classic WOW, the original king of MMOs and my second home.
---
We are prepared! 
---
Use the programmed wheel who decides your class/race to make the decision for you on release.
---
Does someone have a link?
---
Nobody uses rend at high level, except when duelling a rogue.
---
Deep wounds slot is not a problem since it has the lowest priority and will be deleted by other capabilities.
---
All fury warriors go deep wounds btw.
---
Double mouse to move is a fucking godsend when you're hitting abilities like Cone of Cold in pvp, it allows you to do that jump spin. And my CoC is usually bound to "F" or "G" depending.
---
The best hidden alliance PvP racial is faster queue times.
---
Funny. I recovered my old account and I guess I never retrieved my reward for RaF back in 08/09. I picked the Zhevra
---
so it will be pretty hard to casually "dualspecc" in classic right?
---
I mean i do like warriors and good melee combat, but i also have this newfound love for healing. 
---
You sir are the hero we've been looking for, that is definitely the shoulders,  
---
not the robe though :(
---
you can also sap the guy
---
I never reached 60 in vanilla so the only nostalgia I can actullay have is leveling. The nostalgia I cna have is TBC and I dont want that expansion as there is so much shit in it.
---
Atm I've been playing pservers last year or so, and all I want is Classic. It's just a GOOD game, that's all. 
---
Oh its around. Check general, lots of retail players that claim they were around playing vanilla back then saying the game was terrible at the time.
---
I don't care who you are, calling WoW at launch a terrible MMO is such a hilariously untrue take that I immediately stop taking them seriously. Even the people that decided to continue playing DAOC/SWG or other MMOs back then over WoW wouldnt have called WoW a "bad game".
---
There was a missing dog quest in Mulgore originally, with a NPC with a voiced line that said "Have you seen my dog?".
---
So was there two missing dogs after this, or was the original just altered in homage?
---
That's just it: it's the Horde that have fast queue times on Private Servers because of the above.  It remains to be seen what will happen on Classic.
---
I'm very picky and this is a huge issue for me. I love resto druid in vanilla but tree form in classic is ugly as fuck and hides your armor.
---
o yah slow on bridges then poke from safety at the frontline
---
Mate, I'm not talking about blood fury. 
---
Hardiness reduces the chance to get stunned by 25%.
---
warrior always generates more threat than a bear unless bear farms 20 crowd pummelers for every raid
---
Ah I see. Thank you
---
Can't wait to free-base some vanilla wow and re-ignite my fatal addiction.

Sounds like a yummy snack for a small team of friends and their engineering bombs
---
I really miss the days when people took time to write great content rather than throw out videos every day, am I just being old fashioned? Does anyone have any text-based PVP guides? Watching someone play doesn't help unless they continually pause the video and break down their decision-making processes.
---
Fantastic book. My first from Sanderson and I really liked it. Just started reading the second one. Enjoy!
---
It will be more time consuming to get the gold for the reapec, for sure
---
I find having one type of heal for every situation without exception to be bland.
---
Literally this. 
---
As a hunter, i usually get my first full length cloak at around 30 from the auction house. I will take any stats I honestly don’t care. I just wanna see the cape sway on mybtauren tail
---
Not true. In MC BIS, bears have more health and take equal damage to warriors. In BWL BIS, because wrath set is so good, warriors do gain more avoidance. Druids can still attain meaningfully better physical mitigation and retain their health pool advantage. In AQ, warriors retain a slight avoidance advantage but the difference is small. In Naxx warriors again benefit from an extremely well itemized tanking set, but a bear in the best possible gear has an insane health pool and can hit the armor cap with buffs (totally unachievable by warriors). 
---
Being a main tank is hard. It requires commitment to the role and to the inordinate amount of preparation for the sake of the entire raid. The biggest hurdle to being a good main tank is knowing how to prepare for, and execute in every single fight. A properly geared and specced bear druid is just as viable as a properly geared and specced warrior. 
---
I am in much the same boat except I choose to view it as a pleasant thing. Gotta do my studies and other irl things, but when I have me time I’m allowed to be stoked about a game that’s not out yet. To me that’s a wonderful feeling, whatever I end up rolling. I can understand others finding it frustrating tho &lt;3 and sounds like you’ve found a reasonable solution
---
I need to know the release date so I can book my time off as soon as possible!
---
See you at the GY
---
Horde, but alliance has good/cool things in it too.
---
I want to at least try raiding.
---
id rather dps or heal, tanking doesn't interest me.
---
both are ok
---
orc, ud, nelf
---
From memory most tanks and healers ended up levelling alts that were DPS spec for farming and PvP, because paying respec costs several times a week was unsustainable.
---
Usually those alts would end up getting geared from whatever raids the guild had on farm. For example when our guild was getting into AQ40 we'd be quite happy to pile alts into MC runs (which we could knock out very quickly and easily) and maybe into BWL runs (which we'd cleared but it wasn't quite mindless-farming status, and some people still needed gear drops from it).
---
Our tanks and healers thus ended up with their Raiding Mains, which were in full BWL or BWL/AQ40 gear, and their PvPing/Farming Alts, which were in MC/BWL gear.
---
In fact most of them ended up spending more time on their "alts" than their "mains": the mains became raiding characters and their alts became their everything else characters.
---
Poop sock 🧦 what a speed 
---
&gt;I to this very day insist that invisibility mechanics have no place in PVP gameplay. I hate having to play PVP against invisibility classes so much that I judge negatively the quality and character of a person who enjoys making other players miserable in that fashion.
---
Me too, bud
---
And I got addicted so fast, I had to stop playing on p servers lmao. The game is like crack for real. 
---
https://discord.gg/classicwow
---
That's this subreddit's Discord server and there's a guild recruitment channel there.
---
Barrens.chat is also a decent resource: it has a guild list though it's not huge.
---
I know this is not really an answer to your question, but I played healers in the recent expansion and played a holy pally/resto shaman on a TBC private server. Since I plan to play casually I will play a gnome mage for a main and maybe level a priest. I think to really enjoy the vanilla as a healer you need to be part of a raiding guild.
---
I just wanna have a priest if we \*ever\* get TBC, so I can rock shadow there, since it was my favorite class/spec to play :D
---
I chose Druid as my first class because I loved the Druid in Diablo 2. Imagine my surprise when I finally got bear form. From a nightmare inducing gothic werebear to...some weird shaped beaver/bear thing.
---
Lmao literally me, definitely gonna spend that time grinding mobs or fishing in classic.  
---
Sometimes there's literally absolutely nothing to do
---
Ah I just realised I excluded quest rewards from my search for chest pieces. You probably got the Atral Knot Robe from a mage quest. The set looks like this: [https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0R0zJ89cMVzMM9m87MXd87cMdy87u](https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0R0zJ89cMVzMM9m87MXd87cMdy87u)
---
I must add the "distract people off bridges" skill to my repertoire. Thanking you.
---
Toc 25 was better for that. 
---
The infrastructure is battlenet, which you won't be able to avoid.
---
Classic is a completely different game from retail even though it's technically built on the same engine. There's nothing from the retail game that you would need to be able to run or install classic.
---
Is this a hunter kite pull all the way to IF or ?
---
I like how your comment shifts completely in the second part, lmao
---
People with that attitude will have a hard time in vanilla. In vanilla, Druids are Druids. There’s no such thing as “cat Druid” or “bear Druid”. If you spend the majority of your time in one form, you’re playing the class incorrectly 
---
It will be a separate installation.
---
wrong
---
charge saves you from falling off stupid things
---
We've always got the boars though
---
UBRS not on there? wasnt it a 15 man raid at the time of classic?
---
I remember a lvl60 human paladin on Trollbane-EU called Scanjet who started helping a friend and myself level in STV. My friend eventually logged off and the paladin told me to follow him 'somewhere awesome'. He took me up a hill to a waterfall and gave me a bottle of wine. A few seconds later he emotes that his paladin 'slips' and falls on top of me, 'his mouth a few centimetres from mine'.
---
Hand on heart I swear this happened, a paladin tried to sexually assault my little priest. Not all helpful strangers are being altruistic, some are just horny.
---
no, not wrong. but this sub is full of dumb casuals speculating so i can see why you think it might be wrong
---
wasnt naxx out like 2 months before tbc came out?   
---
you think we are going to get old expansions coming back to vanilla wow and in 13 years get a vanilla vanilla wow release
---
Heh oops
---
Can't wait to get away from the yanks telling about trump 247 in w chat. Believe me buddy we all feel the same about your lot. 
---
I will be multiple DAYS. Fuck no you are going to level a warrior without steady supply of blue weapons same pace as a hunter chews through the content, just by having a pet.
---
who was the dragon that you pointed into a corner and then LOS-ed his breath attacks .... i think he was 3rd but could have been any of them to be honest .... 
---
I just hope the release date is not like 2020 or 2021 something crazy
---
While you're right about age-old conversion sites, that was pretty niche and more often was just plain real money stuff, as far as I know.
---
What I don't understand in your example is where the gold in Classic is coming from.  So you're saying Player A's character in Live trades with Player B's character in Live to give him the gold obtained from the token selling, right?  And then Player B's character in Classic trades with Player A's character in Classic to give him gold...obtained from where?  I'm missing something here.
---
NO DAILIES
---
I did this in wotlk to get some easy achievements
---
Nah bro. That's just the nostalgia talking. 
---
/s
---
are we going to have to do the aq hammer grind again ... damn 
---
World Quests just feel like a mandatory "have to do this" before I can do anything else I want to do like dungeons or PVP.  They were a cool idea but became way too required.  
---
Useful in wpvp big fights where you really cant "heal", you just use shield, fear, sapper, reflectors and hope for the best. Holy nova is pretty much the only thing that makes sense after that. But main use ofc is doing DME grinding, the only real supply of gold (solo).
---
Does it tag? Because it doesn't put you on the threat table. 
---
True but I wasnt risking my raidspot for that
---
After having played some of the servers, especially Ascension, I am not sure that I will be able to go back to actual Classic :(
---
..right round!
---
I must assume you have some significant problems in your life that you had to find "fun" in repeatedly killing low level characters in a game who can do nothing to stop you. I presume you feel powerless in your own life, and project these feelings into the virtual world. If it helps at all, I pity you. 
---
Now you have to do them to even get better mount speed / flying mount. I didn't play Legion or WoD, so if I want to even be able to fly in those zones I need to go back and do their dailies for weeks to be able to do it. How insane is that?
---
It's obviously exaggerated, but it sure as hell had its major problems, strongly reflected by the fact that even the guys working on the game didn't know what they were doing back then. People acknowledging that and thus not wanting to play Classic themselves is completely okay. The problems start to pop up when said people try to stop others from enjoying it, whether they were or weren't around for it at the time.
---
!remindme 75 days
---
ofc, it does damage so it tags. threat has nothing to do with it.
---
I’m looking forward to no mythic plus which is worse than dailies in my eyes for content I need to do that I hate

All I know is I can’t wait for Classic and the old gnome models. The “new” ones in retail make all the gnomes look like they are depressed or detoxing 😝😝. I also can’t wait to work on getting exalted with SW on my gnome warrior so she can buy a horse mount 👍🏻👍🏻
---
I am also looking fwd to world pvp, dungeon runs, professions that actually mean something, talent points, class trainers, first aid... oh hell EVERYTHING 😜😜😜
---
After you played main healer for 2-5 years in vanilla, its nice to be healed for once. But the downside is that you are relying in others to actually heal you when shit hits the fan. Cant avoid all damage taken and as a dps if you want to be good at it, you have to push even at low hp. Get that healer "ill start fighting when im 100% hp" mentality out.
---
Just play Resto :P
---
If iam remembering correct, this was the pre tbc event. Kruul replaced Kazzak's place and visited the major cities to introduce himself 
---
I know it sounds stupid, but dailies is the first thing that kind of made me see how badly I was addicted to the game.  
---
Everyone else could see it clear as day when I first started, but it wasn't until dailies that something made me snap out of it and say "wow, this is getting to be a bit much"  
---
And then of course I played like an addict from then until the end of Wrath.  
---
Mining, and then when you have your Truefaith Vestments, you have the stuff to switch to Engineering
---
See I like to gank everyone because if I don't they'll just rush to 60 and gank lowbies. 
---
I'm really doing the world a service. (*vanishes*)
---
It was the expansion that started the process of destroying community interaction. People demanding you link the achievement before they'd let you into pugs for raids was a pain in the neck, compared to TBC where you'd always be able to bluff your way into groups, and LFG meant that all other players just became NPCs with better AI.
---
In TBC I had a friends list filled with good players, tanks,healers,DPS who could CC, etc. That list is long gone now because you're never going to see the other players again after an instance, and I wouldn't get any from raids because I won't get invited without the achievement.
---
Idk what classes you played but Enhance Shaman or Warrior should be able to easily handle 90% of shitty rogues that Ambush then SS to eviscerate then die.
---
Mages feel the same way, can confirm :D
---
At least a blue post for that temporary fix...
---
you know bears get crushed and warriors (mostly) don't. druids are not durable at all. druids are quite shit actually as they only have that niche ability to output sick tps due to crowd pummeler 50% attack speed buff.
---
There is no honor in war! But seriously, nothing is funner then killing everyone I see, till a guild or max lev has to come camp my corps for an hour. Or seeing someone power leveling a friend an kill ing the low lev, an /laugh till you die, knowing you've already won. Good times, cant wait for classic. 
---
&gt;I downloaded a private server
---
hehehe :D. (Connected to\*).
---
While i agree, did you ever read people on this reddit or the classic forum saying "classic was perfectly balanced" as an argument ?
---
That's what i'd call rose tinted glasses and nostalgia great enough to blind people.
---
No good guild will use an enhance shaman, some shaman might have that talent but they’ll still be using healing gear and healing, best way to know if a guild is good is by asking them if they allow any feral/retri/enhance dps or not.
---
Unlike warrior abilities that simply have a flat bonus to threat, Maul has a 1.75x threat modifier (which is further modified by bear form bonuses). This means that feral's TPS scales insanely well with gear. And if a feral uses [Manual Crowd Pummelers](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449), the threat becomes absolutely ridiculous.
---
I have never thought of september as a summer month.
---
The trick on a PvP server is to take a PvP leveling spec. 
---
Meaning take a specific that can kill mobs quickly or without spending over 20% of your mana and keep your health up.
---
So for a Rogue Subtlety is very good for PvO leveling and Chat is decent because even if you've popped Cooldowns you can get away. Assassin sucks because if you Open and Mutilate a mob then your fucked when somebody like a Pro mage comes along.
---
Played warrior in vanilla but i dont see metselde doing it all over again. I really want a caster class which i have to start learning from scratch.
---
I did Some research and i probably will play Orc Warlock. Even tho i always wanted to be a rogue, going in blind with the lock on the leveling journey. Ah can’t wait for it.
---
Happy for you. You have a lot to still read in the cosmere. Mist born and atlantris are amazing too. 
---
Exactly. During the early levels you may very well die if you pull more than one mob and it's very easy to do that on accident. Especially when you're talking about murlocs or kobolds that tend to stack up together, there are even areas where it's completely unavoidable to pull more than one mob. 
---
Hot as a motherfucker as well, hope it won't be as bad as last year or it will be tough to sit inside and play wow all day.
---
Only baddies let their mana go below 70% on a PvP server. Your supposed to take a spec that's defensive and capable of PvP because you have the understanding that this is a warzone and shit happens.
---
If you like deckbuilding games, Slay the Spire is definitely something to look at. That's what I've been addicted to lately.
---
Lupos will probably be nerfed day 1 in classic
---
&gt; it does damage so it tags
---
Pets don't tag, and I think some effects like trinkets/engi bombs might not tag.
---
Hey Guys, 
---
This is Woolworthtrolleys from OCE :D, I am really excited for classic, but I have no friends... So if you are overweight and sits inside your house everyday like me and wishes to find some friendly people to group up and enjoy classic together once it hits please consider joining my discord server and lets have some fun talks while we wait patiently for the release. 
---
Here is the link :D

---
Tanked mc bwl while it was current content. Now tanking Aq and its still fine.
---
It's not. I leveled a warrior in vanilla and it was difficult then I later leveled a rogue, which was also in vanilla it felt like a dream because it was so easy in comparison. As a rogue I had access to stealth to avoid enemies, I had several different cooldowns to either deal with multiple enemies or to disengage from combat. 
---
The hamstring/kiting strat will help a lot but still fighting multiple enemies at a time is usually a death sentence and sometimes you're practically forced to do so. 
---
I really hope I don't get into a server with a ton of private server players. Unless you're running a super hardcore top server guild, you'll be fine getting into a guild as feral/enh/balance/etc. Especially feral considering bears are actually pretty decent off tanks. Of course those specs aren't optimal, but it's a lot of people's version of fun to just go in with 39 friends and just have a good time. Not everyone cares to clear the content as fast or efficient as possible. I'd actually argue that most don't.
---
oh yeah the guides he has made are great. 
---
I think there’s a space for certain guides that still isn’t filled though, people want detailed breakdowns of advanced techniques (juking your opponent, deadzoning effectively, baiting certain abilities or actions, using reflectors and engineering trinkets, XvX class breakdowns and what to expect/anticipate from certain classics, lesser known things like antivenom to counter viper sting, etc) or even just refreshers on simple things the game doesn’t tell you (hit your opponent from behind, sitting causes crits, spell clipping, importance of using a swing timer etc). 
---
These examples are more pvp oriented though, I feel like pve content is a little bit more “solved” and the information is mostly out there. 
---
So you are saying a casual druid does more threat than a casual warrior, but a hardcore warrior generates more threat than a druid who does not use MCP (and doesn't otherwise)?
---
uhm what? pets do tag, idk what you're talking about.
---
The mt of my guild has to fury dualwield tank with full threat set to do the same amount than my druid without a pummeler.
---
Don't forget shamans, Chain lightning is just hilariously bursty.
---
The record without boost is from joanna with 4 days an some hours. Who leveled in less than 4 days?
---
So as a rogue whenever I see a warrior with plate and shield constantly spending all their rate I think "I'm about to educate them."
---
Then when I see a warrior with 80+ rage at all times I think "I'm not fucking with that guy".
---
It's similar when I see a Warlock using all their CC spells to kill two mobs at once. Like, did you not realize this is a PvP server? You should be playing it safe. 
---
I learned the hard way that any half-decent warlock can always beat a shit rogue by just keeping their shields up. I was actually getting harassed by a Demo lock when I was knew to rogue sonrerolled from Orc to Undead for Will of the Forsaken. 
---
And FYI I played exactly the same on my Warrior in BC both in terms of killing alliance and making sure they had to fight me at at least 80%
---
So I've been thinking. Most of the classes has hard counters. if you put a similarly skilled warror against a frost mage, the mage will always win (theoretically) for example. Considering equal skills it many times feel like a game of rock paper sciccors. But I've been wondering if druids has any counters? I kinda feel like a very skilled druid player basically unbeatable in 1v1. Or its a never ending battle between a very skilled druid and a paladin/priest? Is there any class that you can safely say you beat druids with?
---
Crush are fine. With the amount of armor a druid have it feel like a white hit on a war. Crit can be a real pain tho.
---
What bugs?
---
six demon bag was so useless but it was my first trinket
---
Why do you assume the rogue is toxic just because his class and spec is superior to the ret?
---
Regardless, that's completely strawmanning the arguement. In most cases, people will opt for optimal specs over sub-optimal; and sure, you can find outliers where that's not the case, but the overwhelming majority of cases will be like that.
---
If you're purely using CoC to farm harder packs, what do you use for your filler during the 8 seconds? Trying to get better grasps at what I can do for efficiency sake.
---
bingo!, thats the one;  
---
But thats kind of bad news, I mained a lock for the second half of vanilla and most of bc,.   
---
Lock is what I'll be going back too.
---
this is a Mage only robe :(
---
Are mages in short supply? On the lfg monday thread, it seems like everyone needs mages now. The classes I see most talked about atm seem to be druids, priests, and warlocks. 
---

I met my best friend in year 6 because of Fable, a year or so later another friend got me into WoW and found out my best friend played but had to share his account with his 2 brothers at the time so didn't play much. 15 years later we're still boys and have 2 other friends for the last 12-13 that I became good friends with because of WoW in our friend group too.
---
Currently have 3 long life friends who I talk to and game with almost every day because of WoW. Also we live 2 minutes from each other all 4 of us.
---
Why are they better in 5 mans?
---
more like, warrior who does plays bad will probably do less threat than druid (who can just spam maul/swipe) but optimally played warrior will do better. unless druid uses pummelers, yes.
---
Love the book, one of the best out there, I am a quarter through the last book. Definitely would recommend putting on some Two Steps from Hell while you're reading. 
---
ally? i just remembered i played horde
---
I hated the idea of dailies so much I just never did them. Gimped my progress so hard I eventually quit. Such a shame that the community just accepted them lying down and they never went away. 
---
As a holy priest in vanilla, I totally agree. 
---
Just slap on wounding poison, kidney shot out of stealth, kick the flash heal and walk off with an easy kill. Priest not having the ability to remove poison was a killer when all other healer classes could. Hate the rogues. 
---
It's usually Eastern Europeans or Southeast Asians.  I don't mean to sound racist, but I've really found that to be the case most of the time.  It actually makes a lot of sense when you think about how poverty-stricken those regions are.  I know their lives are probably both sad in the pathetic sense and very sad literally, but it's not sad enough to me that I don't still hate their guts when they do shit like that, that's for sure.
---
Fastest leveling is Joana at 4 days 20 hrs on a hunter, there was a video of some other hunter getting it in 3 days 20 hrs or something less than 20 hrs but he had XP values higher that was proven in a video by Joana - 1 quest gave Joana 3600 xp, in other hunters video he got 5000 xp for the same quest so almost a 40% increase.
---
Unless you're an experience priv server veteran who has planned routes and practiced leveling on the hard classes or arent duo or group leveling your gonna be days behind a hunter solo leveling probably even the most mediocre leveler just because how good hunters are at leveling.
---
Dude every other game right now just seems so boring since they said they were gone release classic. None of us could wait but the best we could do Is just prepare and pray that Blizzard will not disappoint us. 
---
They kinda fall off during BWL, they plummet by AQ/Naxx. If you like doing good damage and utility there are better options, otherwise you are literally there to tranq shot stuff and MAYBE kite a couple of things.
---
But would you rather take a toxic ret pally over a friendly rogue?
---
Grinding isn't really "up to you" if you care for the vanilla endgame though. Personally I like doing daily chores, I don't care if they are tracked or not, but either way there's a lot of pressure to grind in vanilla as well. 
---
Well, I guess if you don't care about raiding it doesn't matter, but the same can be said about retail. You can easily ignore all the world quests / dailes if you don't care about your characters power. 
---
Please use our What Should I Play Wednesday sticky.
---
Ele shaman will just one shot you with the best raid gear
---
Please see u/PoachTWC 's comment.
---
Swipe
---
No, but that has nothing to do with their class or spec.
---
It will absolutely be a mix of players much like it was in Classic and still is in Retail.
---
You *will have* hardcore raiding guilds that accept nothing less than specific specs, specific class quotas for raids, and expect high standards in terms of gear, attendance, and preparation for every raid. These will be the top raiding guilds on the server because of this.
---
Below that you'll have a vast throng of semi-hardcore and casual guilds that will offer far more flexibility and whose rules on what you can and can't have as a spec will be varying degrees of looser. These guilds will always be behind the hardcore guilds in terms of progress but, as you say, many players will find the community aspect of those guilds to be preferable.
---
No, if you attack with a pet only then a different player can steal the tag. 
---
I recommend using the Questie addon, it has been phenomenal in helping me practice/route while leveling on a pserver myself. 
---
I'm not assuming that the rogue is toxic. I was just simply stating that if a situation were to occur where I got to choose between playing with a rogue that I don't like vs a retri that I do like, I would choose the retri.
---
I'm sure there are plenty of friendly rogues out there, and nowhere in my comment did I generalize rogues or any class or spec.
---
I don't have time for dailys, I will have so much else to do. Like, playing an actual RPG game!
---
**Warrior Tank** looking for guild, prefer MT, OT possible too.
---
Region: EU
---
Faction: horde/alliance, pref horde
---
Realm type:&gt;&gt;**PVE**&lt;&lt;
---
Times available: 19:30-23:00 Server time any of the weekdays. More in the weekends.  
---
Guild type: casual/semi hc. I've a lot of patience and keep my cool. Wiping and being stuck is fine, such is the nature of the beast. I’m not looking for server kills. Most of all I think I am a decent guy and easy to get along with. I plan to go engineering and make use of consumables as far as time/gold allowances allow me to. 
---
I come in a package with 2 freebies! I bring a great rogue/fury war/shaman dps(undecided) and healer priest (dwarf/troll) healer with me. I currently tank 2 days a week for my current guild which I’ve been part of since 2016. 99% attendance throughout the raid tiers, if interested please contact me.
---
same here. i am glad i will not be forced to play every day to keep up my progression. some day i wont be able to play, some days i will be able to play 10h. and i am glad i will not be punished for that.
---
Try playing Goldeneye 64 now, it has aged horribly. 
---
No you don't, but you do need to finish all the story quest archs for flying etc
---
This is true. You have to reset talents which will cost you a lot and you have get different gears for different specs. Items don't transform into int to agi
---
Mages are very wanted but they’re not in short supply. They will be the second most popular class. 
---
They said it'll be summer 2019 and I hope they won't postpone it
---
Joana's 4d 20h is the best in vanilla, but on private servers people have pushed below 4 days. Joana himself did a 3 day 22 hour run not too long ago. Here's a [link to a twitch clip where he talks about it](https://www.twitch.tv/joana/clip/BadExcitedCucumberDoubleRainbow) 
---
Oh of course, but to say that the semi-hardcore or casual guilds aren't "good," in my opinion, is wrong. A casual or semi-hardcore guild can definitely be good enough to progress through the content. They just won't be server first or may not even be server 5th.
---
I know how it feels at that age, myself being 16 then, so I'm sure you felt bad, but honestly, I hope you didn't.  That was definitely on them to know how sort-of "easy" it is to loot it and to quickly say no to others.
---
Then again, maybe they kicked you as a joke?  It's not that big of a deal after all, and they did invite you back to the raid after that.
---
Hi, /u/MonsterHotDog
---
Unfortunately your post has been removed because it was thought to be low effort.
---
If you feel this was an error or have any questions, please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fclassicwow). Thanks!
---
Fyi, not everyone will play on a fucking PvP server.
---
They also already said they'd cobtain sharding, ic they do it, to starter areas. Starter areas in that context would be the 1-10 zones at a minimum or the 10-20 zones at a macimum.
---
I'm normally the group's healer, but one of my friends say he would like to heal this time, which is fine by me. But he is known for changing his mind, and reroll all the time.
---
So my question is, what hybrid class have the best DPS?
---
And will we lose a lot of DPS compared to a pure DPS class?
---
I know I will do less DPS, but is it 20%, 50% less or?
---
I would like to only level once, and it would be nice to have a backup healer.
---
We will mainly do 5mans, and maybe PvP now and again.
---
We haven't decided on Hord or Ally yet, so both pally and shaman is a possibility.
---
Honestly mythic+ is such a cheap ripoff of Diablo 3 and Diablo 3 does it better.
---
When I want to play an action RPG then I play Path of Exile or D3, not WoW mythics.
---
When you don't actually play the game. 
---
Seems Europeans cry about trump more than Americans even talk about him 
---
Honestly. Let me grind bugs in the hives in Silithus for the Earthstrike trinket for 16hours each day on Saturday and Sunday and let me be on the week days when I have enough other crap to care for. 
---
You could have ended the argument with "I'd rather take a friendly play over a toxic player" and left class and spec choice out of it. 
---
is it really that hard to lvl as prot ? How do people run low lvl dungeons if nobody spec tank/heal ? 
---
Esfand and McConnell
---
I like everything up to J (including F1-4), a 12 button mouse and use of all modifiers, and alt-scroll wheel for action bar 1/2 (good for lesser things like food, pots, pet management and less used down ranked abilities)
---
It is though. When I was in the army I had off from Friday 11am to Monday 7am. So I would just grind my mats and consumes on Friday, do whatever on Saturday, raid on Sunday and Wednesday and again do whatever on the rest of the days. 
---
The point is. I can do the grind binging for days on end if I feel like and then only raidlog for 2hours a week for 4weeks and I still am no further back then other semi casuals.
---
Druids are only better for AoE tanking a few mobs. Warriors are not limited to X number of targets and have superior mitigation via block/parry/miss, while also having cooldowns and potions available.
---
You got the bloodvine set bonus but not the corresponding blacksmithing/leatherworking ones. Granted, they are not as commonly used, so easily forgotten.
---
I never said they weren't good, I said exactly what you've just said.
---
On the "hardcore" guilds:
---
&gt;These will be the top raiding guilds on the server because of this.
---
On the "semi-hardcore or casual guilds":
---
&gt;These guilds will always be behind the hardcore guilds in terms of progress
---
I never said they wouldn't be good.
---
There should be guilds out there that match your schedule. The trick is to find them before Classic release so you can join their server. If you join a random server odds are you won’t find a guild with your schedule. 
---
Yes, I also expect Classic to launch with nerfed Lupos. Tough luck for hunters. 
---
Good warriors doing hamstring kiting (supposedly not working on classic) can do it in about 5-6 /played.
---
But thats really the crop of the top warriors having their leveling path, weapon upgrades and such laid out before heading into the leveling grind.
---
Feral dps on alliance side (because of Kings which helps druids and no windfury which doesn't help druids) will be the most competitive. With MCP (weapon from Gnomeregan) you can actually top meters on shortish fights where you don't have to move.
---
It’s cuz they don’t want people liking it. Plain and simple. 
---
Sorry, but this post was removed a private server gameplay video. Please try r/wowservers for private server gameplay videos.
---
Quick install and it will show up as a separate game in the launcher. Pay them the subscription fee and you can play the game. 
---
PvE fir me
---
Can I heal pugs whilst leveling as an enhancement shaman?
---
Generally, during leveling and end game, how do shamans stack up in pvp?
---
&gt; A ret embracing his role in a medium skilled group is good enough really.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Cleanse the shit out of your warrior, give him BoF and you should be good to go throw in couple heals.
---
Then why go ret
---
Thank you OP, really useful! 
---
But class and spec *do* play a role to some people in their decisions, and is ultimately the topic of this post.
---
I was stating that I would rather take a less optimal class that was friendly than a more viable class that is not, as opposed to taking someone just because of there class as if that's all that they are. The person I was commenting to seems to think that what class you are is everything and if a guild takes a less optimal class then they aren't good, or he/she is trying to say that guilds never take less optimal specs which just isn't true.
---
I was just further cementing my point that I, personally, as well as many others, would rather play with friends, *even if those friends' classes or speca are less optimal*, than to just take raid/guild members because they are a more optimal class/spec.
---
Hamstring kite did work on the demo. Only the 'modern' mobs behaviour was a little more reactive so you took more hits in the process but still less than facetanking. 
---
I check the forums every few hours at least... At least I can use this time to study up on raid bosses and playing my class effectively. 
---
Yes if you keep a set of int gear.
---
You've misunderstood. Whilst we all recognise that trump is a cunt, and sadly representative of the majority of American voters, we don't really care. Its Americans whining about him that's the truly annoying part. 
---
I know. I was agreeing with you lol. I was just further explaining myself more-so compared to the original commenter, not compared to your comment.
---
Long cloak! Ouuuff
---
Above average
---
\&gt; strongly reflected by the fact that even the guys working on the game didn't know what they were doing back then.   
---
Its funny when you look at how the game is today with all the experts that supposedly know what they are doing. What is also interesting is how pretty much every single one of my favourite games were made early in the career of the creators behind it. Its almost as if being ignorant and not knowing exactly what to do is actually a good thing.
---
Honestly I hated having lupos on my Pserver hunter because it took away what little choice I had in which pet to use.
---
I loved when in Cata you could do all your weekly chores (heroic dungeons) in one day. I hated it when they changed that so you have to log in every day to not miss out on something.
---
Let players decide when they want to farm for gold/rep and stop gatekeeping players who want to grind for 2 days straight to finish something.
---
Oh you weren’t trolling.
---
If you prefer Gnome, roll Gnome.
---
A well geared priest/pally/warlock is essentially unkillable for a Druid. Priest and warlock because you don’t have the burst to kill them between fear dim returns so they essentially have unlimited resets on you, and pally because they can literally regenerate mana and heal more than you can dps.   
---
Most other fights are tough as a Druid against good players too. Rogues will evade your bash, trinket roots and blind you before you can abolish up. Hunters can fear you if you stay in any form for more than 2 seconds so they can run you oom very quickly.
---
Watch them repost the orginal Vanilla trailer and just have the new release date at the end of it, I’d be happy lol
---
With decent offensive gear they can still contribute in the offense:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6IGw37\_YrA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6IGw37_YrA)

In wPvP duking it out in BRM, Dire Maul, BS etc. it's just fun taking a dump on people. Not everybody is interested in min/maxing in PvP sitting next to the warrior just enabling him by healbotting. 
---
I enjoy taking my big dick 1handers to the world and furying people to death as warr. Is this min/maxed and #1 arms PvP? No, it's still fun.
---
In the world if you dont get overwhelmed you basically do 2 things for your warrior. Give him BoF, cleanse a bit. This is enough in 99% of the fights in which the warriors disposes of the foe in about 15seconds. 
---
Leaves enough time running after people reckbombing them.
---
Probably not. (They already made the rewind trailer)
---
Daily's weren't bad as a matter of beating farming by grinding.  The problem was the game gradually moved from "Hey, we have this thing called rested XP, which means you don't have to log in every day to advance your character." to "Log in every day or see yourself fall behind the curve."
---
Tight Scope sounds dirty 😅....

---
I think I got the LW one already, but I am indeed missing the BS set bonus. Thanks :)
---
I'll try to find it, but do you remember the name of the set?
---
The thing is sharding hasn't just been in the game since BFA where the lag problems began. It has been in the game at a minimum since Legion launch(which provided us with the smoothest expac launch in a really long time) and there lag was almost never a problem even when huge amounts of people came together for world bosses.
---
Also, why do people keep bringing up world pvp with 40 man raids? Even on private servers, even the bigger ones with 3000+ population and sth like 10k peak at launch, don't have events like that occur outside of the release when basically everyone is on the same level and during AQ opening event. People here tend to talk about it like there will be daily mega battles of 100+ people in certain areas. That may be the case for the time before battlegrounds launch but afterwards that will vanish just like it did back then on retail.
---
As a mattwr of fact, most of the world pvp on private servers and retail looks like this:
---
1. Some betas want to jerk off to killing lowbies leveling in STV/Tanaris/Hillsbrad/Stonetalon/Ashenvale
---
2. People using the ganking of lowbies to lure out the people that want to do actual world pvp
---
3. And ofc the people that have actual balls and do world pvp where there are actually people on the same level, like Tyr's hand, any of the high level dungeon entrances etc.
---
The best you can do is wait. So far, the classic devs have made some good posts so that the commubity can take a peek into their ideas. The problem is that the current classic community is filled by a lot of people that have been disconnected from Blizzard for a long time. The death of Nostalrius(and the subsequent outrcy) was certainly one of the triggers for Classic. The communities on private servers are generally cynical and negative and most of the discussions that happen there regarding retail are based on rumors or false facts or even simple misunderstandings and lack of interest in further matters. Over at their own subreddit you can see that first hand as most posts have 0 or fewer upvotes and the replies in those don't fare better either with a lot of server bashing, shilling(I hate that word so much) and sarcastic and cynical remarks.
---
Fearmongering based on rumors, false and misinterpreted information is something this community shouldn't need. Especially considering how the biggest positive people claim for vanilla to be the community. Yet people don't realize how all of this makes them almost as toxic as the retail community - if not worse.
---
What interaction could there possibly be between the retail and classic games?
---
I was wearing the lvl58 version of pvp armors and likely greens as I was doing this on DM release on nd. Pretty sure I had not reached r10 at that point either so I wasn't in full set, I wouldn't doubt that being in full of the eagle greens(essentially ur pvp gear)would be a relative breeze compared to a prot warrior in early gearing stages if we're talking dm west specifically, although maybe you would want the 2h armor mace off tribute runs first
---
What do you mean how they release classic with WC3 reforged? Wc3 reforged is coming out in december.
---
Kiting makes ofc a difference but I doubt that 5 days is possible. The Dmg Output is just too bad for that. Its just s fucking pain killing mobs with a white/Green weapon. 
---
No dailies! Now I can grind mobs for less reward at my own pace. Yay.
---
Fastest leveling with accurate xp values was done on Northdale release with 3d9h.
---
For me the defining factor is utility: Both can tank the dungeon just fine, both can generate enough threat, both are resilient enough.
---
But a bear tank can buff each party members stats, can pull more reliably, can generate threat from range, can innervate the healer (or even rez him up) or can even do some clutch healing when necessary. (especially with HoTW spec).
---
A bear tank can hot himself up and tank half of the pulls without much intervention from the healer. This allows the healer not only to save mana, but the group can pull while the healer is drinking. This causes less downtime.
---
Doing 100 *different* world quest is required as part of unlocking flying in both legion and bfa.
---
Don't you need rep? Aka spam world quests 
---
Problem is that so many classes can turtle the fight against the ret if they play avoidance. 
---
You dont even really need much int gear till like 40 too, you'll end up drinking more though.
---
Kinda set on Human Warlock; I just prefer alliance.
---
However, warlock on alliance seems like its kinda weak due to tremor totem, undead rogues about etc. 
---
Would it be better to consider a mage as an alternative?
---
Crescent Staff (bit fast tho)
---
Bite of the Hydra
---
Corpsemaker
---
(Whirlwind Axe if you have a guildy helping you farm it, I did it as two level 30s, warrior and shaman)
---
Bonebiter
---
X'caliboar
---
Stoneslayer
---
Rockpounder
---
Speedlevelers do not necessarily level alone. Just on the last pserver launched a group of 4 leveled together and were far ahead of the others (though not first to hit 60 obviously)
---
Im looking forward to rushing to 35 - 40 as a lock, going to redridge and finding a nice rooftop or perhaps a quest heavy area to cast my curses from and giving them ye olde undead /lol
---
idk what game you are talking about, its certainly not the case in vanilla.
---
Side question: can we really still expect it to release this summer?  
---
It's april already, I would've expected them to announce the date before now if they still plan on releasing before september.  
---
Im getting woried the release has been postponed to Q3/Q4.
---
July 16
---
can you recommend a holy pala pvp spec? thought about something like this. 
---

---
Parents are super pissed I'm taking 10 months to play hardcore classic. It will be as soon as I graduate but I have a lump sum of savings.
---
I like to tank so I know that I am pretty locked Into warrior. I am debating between leveling a Warlock or a Mage first to help with my warrior leveling process. potentially duo-leveling with my paladin friend. Could some experienced warlocks and mages help make the case for one over the other at 60 for both pvp and pve. I am also open the general suggestion when It comes to leveling my ranged dps first or second. Thank you in advance.
---
What's a good Paladin leveling build so I can ret while questing while still being able to heal in dungeons? Can I do the same at the endgame?
---
I'm sure you remember all those times when the raid wiped from a dps overaggroing, don't you?
---
And no, telling L2P to DPS isn't the only solution, not even the best. Especially true with mages and warlocks who have a really hectic threat generation (shadowbolt crits and ignites).
---
Having higher threat while lowering durability is often desirable. Your healers  have to output more HPS and thus are using more mana per second, but the fights are safer and your dd's can produce more DPS, ending the fight sooner and thus overall lowering healer mana spent.
---
Easily. Part of Q3 is summer. The season itself ends September 23rd, fiscal year ends September 30th. 
---
So they still have over 5 months before they have to worry about a delay.
---
Not the heart disease statistic though. America is still the most obese first-world country out there, with an estimated 50% of the adult population being obese by 2030. People are lifting forks, not weights.

Well, today you learned

It's a little worse because of how crit-dependent it is. But go for it if you want.
---
Its usually better to just get a resto shaman to spec further down into the enhance tree for imp totem. Though its not usually done on prog as the mana from tide is better. 
---
If you want to raid as enhance you definitely still can, you're going to spend most your time totem-twisting and applying nightfall.
---
Same age! Man was it tedious to get gametime over my brothers and strict parents. Still managed to hit 60 with a troll Rogue and tauren shaman! This time however I'll experience the raiding aspect and will be one of those with the largest e-penis! 
---
Yup it was true in vanilla for a long time, Hunter and Warlock pets, if you don't deal damage yourself not only can someone else steal the kill but you can't loot the corpse. It was too prevent afk campers from farming a mob with pet auto attack.
---
But you can do what you want, instead of doing the same 10 actions 1000 times or fall behind
---
I understand that druids arent nuke machines, but my question was about if there are any hard counters for druids or just even soft counters for that matter. I just can not imagine a scenario where a skilled druid who knows how to powershift, switch forms, etc. and is equally geared to his opponent can not come out victorious or make it a tie.  
---
&gt; you'll be fine getting into a guild as feral/enh/balance/retri/etc.
---
I am curious. What makes you think this?
---
trust me there is plenty you have or need to do when you login to vanilla.
---
i was a lock so i went and did av every day and filled my bags with shards for a raid.
---
i also needed gold for stuff all the time
---
buy or create consumables
---
profession related junk
---
vanilla had dailies they just were not meanless busy work quests put in by blizz
---
i also love healers but i hate questing on healers so the expansions with no daily's were the best
---
Yes,  how is doing story line quests... Dailies?
---
Yes, there's also a requirement to do 100 different world quests as part of pathfinder in legion and bfa, in wod it's just rep grind.
---
Not too surprising. Without heavy hands-on experience, even as a developer it's very hard to know what the customer truly wants, and even then if you focused only on what they wanted *now* you'd see no innovation or improvements whatsoever (which is what BC brought to the table).
---
Imagine actually caring more about a completely pointless change more than a kid who used his Make a Wish to go to Blizzard and later died. Either You're a complete edgelord and need to grow up or you seriously need to reconsider your ethics.
---
it was patched out in 1.3 with the reason it being a bug.
---
Can vouch for Mistborn i just finished first book and i am hooked :D
---
Yes its true you are a very special snowflake and in fact feral druids can tank all current content better than a warrior! Wow!
---
No dallies, no being forced to be part of an endless grind for no reason. 
---
I'm not sure what you guys are talking about for vanhilla grinding move and reagents... I raided MC, BWl &amp; AQ with so much free time... It was an absolute blessing. 
---
You can heal any dungeon as any spec at any level as a paladin.
---
&gt;​
---
Literally they had to generate gold from mobs, by botting. Same goes for PS realms. They had to generate the base economy gold before people could buy it, and if they can rein in the bots there may be hope yet.
---
This will just affect the Price of gold, If its manually farmed.
---
Well, WoW truly evolved into an action RPG tho. It's not just MMORPG but MMOARPG now - see how all the combat, levelling, all abilities and dungeon runs work. A lot of people like it (more power to them), for the rest of us there is this old school RPG called Classic WoW.
---
Yes. I rarely succumbed to them when I played during MoP, but it will feel good to just *not* have them anymore. This will allow me to simply play an alt when I have done the stuff I want to do on my main for the time being, instead of doing the same shit every day. 
---
The wait will take care of this. Someone is probably making one right now.
---
This is getting stressful, I have work bookings in May and June already and more I need to lock in soon. Can't they give us a date soon. I can't stand the thought that they will give it at the last minute and my boss will knock back my leave.
---
I don't think anyone has gathered enough reliable data to tell you the differences between class level times. Hunters are the fastest and warrior is the slowest. If I had to make a guess, It's probably a day or so time difference between the fastest hunters (sub 5 days) and fastest warriors. I've leveled 2 hunters and 2 rogues to 60 and the difference wasn't staggering, but it was noticable. 
---
My friend leveled as a fire mage back in vanilla. Personally, I have also leveled mages as fire mages in BC and WotLK. It works and I thought it was fun. You will be better off killing single mobs imo.
---
You sound like a gnome.
---
I don't think you have what it takes to be a Majestic Horde Shaman.
---
Well isnt it a waste to put a full resto in a melee group? Mana tide does not so much for that group I mean. Note I only raided ZG on my shammy back then and was more into raids on alliance. So my knowledge is weak regarding shaman. Hence questions. :-)
---
You can heal as Ret all the way to 60, just bring a lot of water.
---
I had the "Bloodvine Garb" and "Primal Batskin" sets, but not "Blood Tiger Harness" and "The Darksoul". Those were added.
---
The "Bloodsoul Embrace" set seems to be available to anyone, being BoE and not requiring any profession skill for anything at all. Is this correct, or is this just something the database I searched got wrong?
---
So If people could buy vanitypets, like lurky or whatever that little murloc was called, you’d not play?
---
Totally different playstyle... PvP will be less fun as a lock on Alliance side but hey, at least you got Pally's backing you up!
---
If you like Warlock playstyle I wouldn't doubt.
---
I asked this in the previous thread but I never actually checked to see if it got any replies so I'll ask again.
---
When Classic hits, my plan is to roll either a resto shaman (so obviously Horde) or a warrior on a PvP server with a few of my coworkers, but I also want to maintain at least one Alliance character on a different server, most likely a PvE one. What would give a different enough (but primarily satisfying and fun in a challenging way) experience for me to be able to retreat to it when I don't feel like PvPing or otherwise playing with my coworkers? I'm primarily comfortable with single-target healers and melee DPS, but I'm happy to go outside my comfort zone so I'd be okay with anything besides maybe a hunter.
---
Play what you enjoy first and foremost. If the fantasy of a Human Warlock appeals to you, play a Human Warlock.
---
:( I feel like a Shaman just not a Majestic Horde Shaman
---
Never
---
We all have different ideal versions of the game, too. Of all the MMO's that I played, only old WoW and Guild Wars 1 ever hooked me. And it's not *just* nostalgia! The addition of certain features can be a negative to my experience of the game.
---
My ideal would probably be something like:
---
- Naxx patch 1.12 but with updated racial graphics
---
- Slightly altered classes or rebalanced items so that stuff like Guardian/Balance Druid can be feasible in raids etc.
---
- 10 &amp; 20 man raids, because I have no friends and always enjoyed 10-man groups the most.
---
Of course, this game has *never existed* in such a state. But I'll take ANY version of the game which drops LFD/LFR tech and much of the convoluted narrative of most expansions, that's by far the most important thing to me. I legit look forward to manually assembling a dungeon group while leveling; it really allowed me to engage my organisational personality, so to say. 
---
that requires farming dungeons. unless you have solid group already there is no way for that to be efficient
---
Roll Shaman and embrace your inner Horde!
---
Hybrids having more than one balaced role.
---
not shaman but im sort of in the same boat , always played alliance , ive tried horde a few times and the cities are so strange.
---
like if i need to get somewhere i know for alliance but i dont for horde 
---
and on vanilla servers half the time i walk into aliance guards because i dont know where horde fp's are.
---
maybe i can learn horde side but we will see.
---
i guess you have to decide if you care about being aliance or shaman more.
---
for what its worth we should have much better addons that help make it easier to navigate
---
If some guy is grinding something 10-1000 times, you're still gonna fall behind compared to him. Only difference is there's no daily limit to hold that guy back now.
---
Vanilla was really good at conveying what you were doing in the world through gameplay. A really good example of this is the Alliance Onyxia attunement chain.  
---
I intend to skip all quest text (outside of the few times I have to skim to figure out where to go), and just enjoy that part of it.
---
play druid. you dont have to play a paladin on alliance, druids are more similar imo
---
Vanilla had a sense of accomplishment and earning that is lost in today's MMOs. Everything today is instant gratification and instant rewards. I think it's a much more rewarding feeling to put a lot of time and effort into something than to just be handed it. 
---
If you reached level 60 and obtained epic gear in vanilla you were somebody, you felt good about your character, you felt accomplished. Today reaching max level and getting epic gear happens within a day or 2 of playing, you don't have the struggle or the time investment on your character. 
---
You lose the attachment to your character and to the world when you can replace your character in days as opposed to months or even years. There were huge personal achievements in vanilla that don't exist today. Getting a legendary back then was extremely hard work super rewarding. If you were a Scarab Lord and your character got deleted you would feel physically depressed because of all of the hard work, time, and effort you put into that accomplishment. Today if your character gets deleted you pretty much lose nothing and can just log on a week before the next major patch and get caught up. 
---
I played a priest back in vanilla, started a mage last year on a private server and made a priest alt there too (and am raiding on both, priest in pugs, mage in guild runs).
---
As a healer, you're a god. You're responsible for everything, you allow things like no-tank dungeon runs where everyone just pureley zergs through to work, the cleartimes depend only on you're abilities to properly heal while conserving mana, and in pvp you enable actual group play synergies.
---
On top of this, for me there is no better feeling than playing wsg on my priest, healing the flag carrier while peeling off half of the enemy team at the same time with fears, rocket helm, net and grenades.
---
You decide about life and deaths, and sometimes the better choice is to just letting party members without any mana die when you know the resurection times is just a few seconds.
---
Having such a huge controle over the battlefield, whether is pve or pvp, is really enjoyable.
---
I saw things differently last year, but now now I kind of regret mainly playing my mage on this private server over my priest. In classic I will absolutely play a healer again, but probably a paladin just to mix things up.
---
Ritual of Souls/Ritual of Refreshment.
---
Forcing everyone to trade to get healthstones and food was more shortsightedness than a design decision, and it made raid prep take so much longer than it needed to be.
---
So while I don't want them in Classic, I will severely miss them...
---
Then again, maybe they did it because it's the only action mages and locks get in raids outside of slamming their face onto the frost/shadowbolt and fireball key. After all, according to every mage in existence "Mages can't decurse, I have to keep spamming fireball."
---
I don't like dailies either, makes it an obligation to log in and do them like every day. World quests are much better though, since they don't really give you that obligation but accomplish basically the exact same thing (giving us an objective instead of mindlessly grinding mobs like in classic). They also make you travel all around the world instead of sitting in the same grind spot or whatever every time. 
---
I'm not sure exactly how much grinding is involved in classic end game, but from what I've seen it's quite a lot even compared to retail where there are more clear cut systems actually emphasising it (AP). And I honestly don't understand why you guys would prefer mindlessly grinding mobs for gold/rep/whatever over having dynamic quests pop up all over the world that you could do instead for the same rewards. That just is a much more satisfying system to me. 
---
To be clear, I definitely don't propose we somehow add this to classic. I'm just somewhat questioning your excitement about the lack of this particular feature. 
---
&gt;Each hit has a 20% chance of granting the attacker 1 extra attacks with 315 extra melee attack power. 
---
So Improved Weapon Totem gives a 30% boost to the 315 extra melee attack power. Meaning 94.5 additional attack power. Attack Power increases your base melee damage-per-second (DPS) by 1 point for every 14 Attack Power. So an additional 6.75 dps when it activates, which is 20% of the time. Overall then, 1.35 dps added. 
---
Given how pointless the Enhancement tree is for raiding, I don't personally think that's worth it. I have zero raiding experience though so maybe I'm missing something. But I don't see how missing out on 5/5 Purification and Mana Tide totem is worth that small of an increase. 
---
Well, tbh, there are a lot of things in vanilla WoW that I do not like and that I think can improved without losing the vanilla feeling.
---
Like the perpetual running around. Add a gazillion extra quests and quest hubs everywhere but not make mobs or quests itself easier and it wouldn't impact the vanilla feeling. 
---
There are dailys. Farming mats for consumables, farming 5man for runes,...... ;) 
---
You can rotate the target as a druid too. Only other multitarget that warrior has that druid doesnt is battleshout spam. Druids have better dodge, armor and more hp to start with.
---
Me, as a healer druids are the best 5man tanks at L60, because you are not going to cc on every pull. You dont have that option always and everyone just seems to aoe. Druids increased dps and threat make the runs much smoother.
---
Difference in kill speed is negligible for single target. The downside is the lack of survivability, in 5-mans you’ll still do more damage overall as frost because of aoe, for single target and boss fights fire does more damage.  
---
in wod there are no wq/daily, you need to farm mobs for rep
---
What's the most unjust thing about that - bears in the outdoor actually can parry.
---
Have you considered shadow priest? You can heal dungeons without needing an extra set of gear until 60, plus they're a decent PVP class (or you can switch to a PVP healer spec). Very little downtime while levelling since a big chunk of your damage will come from wanding. You'll never have to eat/drink unless you're PVPing or racing to tag as many mobs as you can.
---
I liked them in TBC where they were almost entirely optional. 
---
Due to my deep trove of Chuck Norris jokes, I make friends wherever I go.
---
&gt; World Quests just feel like a mandatory "have to do this" before I can do anything else I want to do like dungeons or PVP. 
---
Really? I just do them in downtime, while forming groups and that sort of thing. And compared to dailies it really doesn't matter much if I don't do them for a few days. It's not like I have a daily cap I feel like I have to reach or whatever. 
---
A true role-playing RPG game I would say.
---
Yeah no. The problem with Americans is that they have a completely different perspective about what an overweight human looks like. Let's say in Europe a little bit overweight guy would be considered, well overweight. Meanwhile in America he would be considered as perfectly fine. That part about lifting exercising, like really?
---
Well you can play something else on the alliance side, if horde doesn't feel right to you.
---
You don't have to play paladin. 
---
You dont want to roll on a faction you dislike already in the beginning. It will come back later and you'll regret it
---
You guys definitely kiss
---
Dailies of TBC and Wrath were fine. But what they made in MoP 5.0 was disgusting. When they decided that they should even get rid of 25 daily daily (I know) quest cap. That was a true shitfest.
---
True! Happen in my guild too, at least for people with a lot of time .
---
&gt; i was a lock so i went and did av every day and filled my bags with shards for a raid.
---
The invisible ghosts just south of Raven Hill in duskwood are perfect for relaxed shard-farming. Juust enough levels to get a shard. Easy to kill. Neutral until attacked. No competition from non-warlocks because they're invisible.
---
Plus, they're super easy to get to as Alliance.
---
Thanks man.
---
I added Signet of Expertise, and Mithril Insignia (under doubt). I didn't add the Broken Blade of Heroes since it is only used to produce the Reforged Blade of Heroes, which is BoE and does not require any profession skill. Therefore, it doesn't quite fit the bill.
---
Oooo my apologies!
---
A true Role Playing Role Playing game? :P
---
MC Raiders by Myndflame
---
Don’t change your plans for unreliable friends. If you want to play a healer, play a healer. There’s no point switching your class or faction to accommodate someone who is likely to quit or re-roll before 60.
---
Your plans for Classic should stand on their own two feet, independent of your friends, so that when they inevitably quit or re-roll you’re unaffected.
---
Do what *you* want to do, and try to get your friends on board with *your* plans, rather than the other way around.
---
Thanks, good to know! I was just thinking how much of a pain it would be to get two armor sets as a Paladin then I realized you got all the spell mail/plate for free anyways lol
---
Apologies I should have explained that with tide you would move the shaman to a caster group. 
---
To make it more understandable: A resto shaman with tide in a caster group is better than a resto shaman specced into imp totem in a melee group on prog.
---
When raids are on farm resto with imp totems can be subbed in as bosses die faster and you dont need as much mana.
---
Personally I prefer grinding over dailies:
---
\- It's more flexible (I can do half an hour a day, or 4hrs one evening)
---
\- It's possibly to switch off and just get into a rhythm with grinding in a way that dailies don't quite allow
---
\- I can achieve something as fast or slow as I want (exalted can take a couple of weeks or half a year depending on how important it is to me)
---
You can switch groups around mid fight. This means move mana tide to caster healer group then move back.
---
What's role of druids in PvP and PvE at lvl 60? I know they do well at carrying flags in WSG, tanking 5 mans and off-tanking (some) raids. But can they heal/dps somewhat competetively? I originally wanted to play mage, but I'm still not convinced.
---
Being able to queue for BGs while I'm farming and not having dual spec. Not the end of the world, but they're the two things I'll miss the most in Vanilla and they're linked since I'll have to farm to switch specs.
---
They were most definitely readible by the opposing faction for quite some time back in vanilla. 
---
I'd say about equal. But I'm no expert. Maybe due to fear ward allies want more? 
---
BTW it's one of the tryhard ways to min-max your char as a clothy guy - lvl up your tailoring to 300, craft the needed chest piece and drop the tailoring for another profession that you actually need like engineering.
---
It’s interesting to look at how WowCrendor has viewed Classic servers in the past vs. now. Just a few years ago he was saying that Classic servers would fail, and that people would realize that Classic wasn’t all it was hyped up to be.
---
Then Nost was shut down, and he had a change of heart. He started to realize just how much people truly wanted Classic servers, not just for nostalgia’s sake but also because of a genuine love for what many consider to be the best version of the game. Since then, has become very supportive of the idea, and needless to say he was happy with BlizzCon 2017.
---
Did dmg slow down that much in BWL? I thought they were fine for BWL. But I agree 100% for AQ40 and Naxx dmg falling off a lot compared to other classes
---
there were mobs in av that were pretty easy to farm, i also played av a lot so id do a bit of both.
---
tbh tho even full bags was never enough lol
---
id always end up filling bags on trash
---
The fact that you ever did daily’s is sad.
---
oldschool runescape is proof of this concept working well.
---
I'm honestly looking forward to spending an evening sitting in Lushwater Oasis, fishing for Deviate Fish, and reading /g.
---
Skinning/mining/enchanting. Any of those three will be best.
---
We were #1 on our server form vanilla to Wotlk and we ran an oomkin in vanilla.
---
I’ve leveled a few mages on 1x servers. I always say ‘I won’t AOE this time...’ but I always do. It’s really satisfying, a lot more satisfying than single target/drink repeat. 
---
I am playing on the pserver from time to time, helps me with that urge to play the OG wow.
---
As a private server player I cannot stress enough how ass-backwards you have this.
---
We're not burnt out and treating it like just another "F R E S H" launch. This is it, this is the big one. Hell we're probably more hyped than anyone else because we have been playing it for years and we know we love it without the nostalgia/rose tinted glasses factor. Seriously every single person I know from P.servers is hyped for classic in a way that your post tells me you don't understand.
---
An analogy: Absence makes the heart grow fonder, but I don't need to leave my wife for 12 years in order to be excited about seeing her. 
---
Get all the greens of +fire damage. Go find nagas. Pyroblast-tab-pyroblast. It's ok. You're gonna drink a lot.

No this was part of the pre TBC launch event. Doomlord Kazzak was the mob that hunters could kite to major cities at one point. The guy in the screenshots is Highlord Kruul, Blizzard spawned him outside of major cities a few days before TBC dropped. They share the same model though I think. 
---
I had so much fun on the private server leveling a hunter the world PvP was incredible. I was rank 8 by the time I got 60 and was consistently in the top 20 kills for the alliance each week. But once I got to max level and farmed my epic mount and my prebis and started raiding I got bored real bored. Their job in raiding is quite boring plus their rotation is very simplistic. Just like mage if one of your friends isn't already a rogue I would totally suggest going rogue. 
---
You can get a ww axe with a friends priest or paladin(better someone else too). It will be a pain in the ass, but possible.
---
It is fun, but as it's been already said, more reliable on RNG crits since you won't be able to cheese juicy Ice Shards + Shatter combo unless you go elemental in 50+levels. 
---
Also more mana consuming and you are very vulnerable in PvP situations unless you are attacking first with Pyroblast from the bushes.
---
Sadly RPG has devolved and needed emphasis 
---
Wait. Did we meet in game?
---
So in MC you're just above most mages and below most rogues/warriors. In BWL almost every other class sees a fairly large increase in DPS while hunters see very marginal gains. Its the first widening of the gap.
---
Obviously you aren't a true shaman if you're not willing to embrace orc master race for shaman.
---
Say you’re going on an overseas trip and then hermit up in the man cave for the month. Be sure to stock up on the “dew”. 
---
Good Bot.
---
You are correct! According to the timestamps this happened like six days before TBC dropped. 
---
Prayer of healing?
---
I agree with you, but I still think my point is valid as well. In a 5 man it makes a difference if your tank does double the dmg regarding clear time.
---
Don't forget first mount @ 40 😲
---
i think its more to help cover aoe heal
---
horde has shamans for it
---
Pets in defensive mode that respond to attacks will no longer flag their masters for PvP. If the master issues an explicit attack command, the master will be flagged.
---
You can issue pet commands while you are stunned, fleeing, etc.
---
Pets and summons no longer get stuck when you get on a boat or zeppelin.
---
Non-aggressive enemy NPCs no longer attack pets and summons.
---
Doesn't say anything about mob tagging. 
---
not confirmed though
---
Horde locks are definitely stronger in 1v1 but, as a group paladins help you out way more than shamans, your dots get dispelled much less, pets make for great totem stompers with the right macros, curse of tongues hurts shamans immensely, and with a little specialized gear, catseye + perception + paranoia etc you can get pretty insane stealth detection radius, wotf hurts for sure but it's not a death sentence in most fights
---
:(
---
thats the stereotype everyone parrots but it doesnt fit me
---
He did answer, something like a warlock is definitely a counter. That's why druids level blacksmithing for the anti fear trinket. With that you might have a better chance?
---
I've got nothing to sell, but the first thing to pop in my mind for you is a ***mage***.
---
1. Chill leveling, but lots of downtime spent drinking at higher levels
---
2. Awesome in dungeons with food &amp; drinks, Polymorph, great damage and portals.
---
3. Potential for AoE grinding (Dire Maul farming, for example) at endgame for a smooth stream of gold.
---
It's a step outside of your comfortzones, so it's something new as well. Just give it a shot up until level 20 or so. You can always roll something else if you don't have a feel for the class.
---
That dude summed up so accurately in just two words how everyone in Ironforge was feeling that day. I love how he's sprinting away from the boss while he typos it, always cracks me up. 
---
I promise you I stared at the picture for good 5 mins without noticing any difference.
---
I thought it was another April's Fool, till I read the comments.
---
The fuck kind of beavers ya'll got?
---
As fire being so gear dependant I would advise against it. Also the lack of survivability that fire lacks is another reason. Frost may be not as fun or burst oriented but you will shred in PvP! They dumpster warriors and hunters in PvP if you can dead zone kite them. But even at 60 fire isn't really viable until aq because you just won't have the gear required to maintain the crit levels for it to do proper damage and a lot of mobs in MC/bwl are fire immune. You know fire elementals and dragons.
---
Just because there are no daily quests doesn't mean you don't have "dailies" \^\^
---
My husband's stepbrother gave him one of these to get him into the game. I remember it clearly. It was for Christmas of 2005.
---
Really hoping it’s earlier in the summer. We have a lot of work to do. 
---
That's how enhancement shamans earn their raid spots by tricking their not so well educated RL's into believing that Imp. Windfury is a very strong boost (it says 30% so it must be big!) when in fact it is a minor improvement. 
---
1.35 DPS is a bit of underestimation, but it still usually floats around 10 DPS. 
---
I played throughout Legion and didn't have any problems in large scale wpvp, or in raids. Fact is, when BfA came out, doing world quests was almost impossible for me, and I wasn't the only one. There were many threads on r/wow about the crazy lag.
---
Now maybe Blizzard fixed the lag issues in a later patch. I stopped playing a few months into BfA
---
Just like the other guy said, Engineering brings A LOT. I excluded it from this post so I could just tackle all the other professions for now, and possibly look at engineering later. Compiling a list for engineering looks like it would be a chore, though.
---
Hard agree. They were perfect in that game. 
---
I am in a similar situation, My approach is going to be 30/0/21 Shaman.  Ele DPS in 5 mans, can backup heal if really needed.  Works for PVP.  
---
I'll be respeccing full resto for raid spots.  
---

Best of luck.
---
I have an operation due in October will be having 2 months of work, never thought I would say this but I am very much looking forward to my recovery by playing WOW classic.
---
But in regards to your question I think your best bet is to throw yourself in front of a car ;)  (Hope this helps)
---
Wow you picked a heck of a time to start the game! I remember some newbie dwarf there who had started the same day this happened and he thought this was what WoW was like all the time lol!! We had to explain that this was a very, very special day. 
---
World quests killed my pleasure in the game. Nowadays, you think "I've to do this before Wednesday or my progression of the week is lost". Before, it was just I'd like to do this and that.. Could be this week or another, who cares? 
---
I doubt it. They wouldn't have come up with all those blue posts this month if they had development issues. It's pretty clear to me that they have entered finalization of the project. Now they are working on internal testing and getting all the details right.
---
As a Rogue: Spam buttons win game with eviscerate.
---
private server BAD
---
Why take it all in one go?
---
Take a few one week holidays over a period of a few months. No excuses needed. They're just holidays.
---
Is your first character having tailoring/enchanting a really good idea? Wouldn't that bankrupt you? I'd say save the Enchanting (if ever) for an alt.
---
Fishing was one of my favorite things about the game. You can sit there fishing, make money, plan things out, and just relax. 
---
I want to enjoy a class where i can level up relatively easy and at the same time be a challenge in terms of world pvp and ganking. I prefer not to respecc all the time and would hope to some what be able to play a class with an efficient raiding build that is also useable for duels and world pvp.
---
Classes im interested in are as follows: rogue, Hunter, warlock and shaman. Maybe mage.
---
Any suggestions on what of above classes is closest to what im looking for? If any other classes fit my bill than the ones mentioned above im willing to listen. 
---
This 100% this! World quests were awesome for gearing up easily when that was what the game eas about. But vanilla isn't about that life gearing up is a journey. 
---
Say you're depressed and need some unpaid leave, if you're morally okay spinning that web.
---
Black lotus was BOP before patch 1.7, no idea how they will release it. Although its end products are flasks which are BoE.
---
Why do you need 3 months? Just treat your life like normal and play the game. If you literally no life and play 16 hours a day you will hit 60 in like 1 week
---
No need to apologize, happens all the time! Thanks for your understanding.
---
The dungeons are quite easy and tankable as arms or fury, even a shield is kinda optional until Scarlet Monastery
---
I'm similar. Been a Shaman since BC and it makes me sad thinking I won't be hanging out in Ironforge.
---
But Shaman takes priority over faction for me, so I'll be embracing my inner Horde.
---
Hi similar, I'm dad!
---
I don't know what you're working, but I guess a broken leg could give you an excuse to take that timespan off. Now the important question you need to ask yourself is: How strong is your *will*? 
---
^I'm joking, pls don't consider breaking your leg to play Classic, just take vacation and some sick days at max. Other than, you could pretty much just leave your job, which I can't recommend. 
---
I dunno I never felt like that. But I understand why people do, it does feel like falling behind if someone is already exalted for example and you are not.
---
But in the end it is basically rep grinding to me, when I feel like it I do some world/daily quests to increase my rep. If I fall behind and get that revered/exalted a bit later, whatever. I mean it gives you mount speed, or flying later on. Is that really that important, that you have to work on unlocking it asap? Flying is not even added to the new expansion for like a year after its out, so I don't feel like I am rushed to unlock it.
---
But thats just me maybe. I am not saying it is good or bad. I do wish sometimes that you could grind using other methods than dailys though. Like in vanilla, if i really wanted to grind argent dawn rep or something I could just go whole night stratholme, or grind some skellies in plaguelands etc. I do agree that type of time management is missing. Like if all I want is that rep, and I have 2 hours to play but I am out of dailies for that rep, I am shit out of luck currently in the game, and it is kinda annoying sometimes.
---
I expect that they will release it as BoE. Either way, I don't think it fits the list, for the reason you stated in your last sentence.
---
I bought Witcher 3 because I found myself spending waaay to much time watching classic YouTube videos and f5 this sub. The game is so immersive it actually took my hype for classic down to a more healthy level.
---
The quest is picked up in shimmering flats but it requires you to go kill a boss in ZF. 
---
Me too. I would play Simons quest every day even if I didn't do anything else. It provided a different way to earn gold.
---
I haven't completely changed my plans, as I'm still gonna pick a class that can heal.
---
But as I don't have a preference when it comes to vanilla healer, I'm gonna use this to narrow it down, by choosing a healer with a good DPS spec.
---
We are 5 friends who's gonna play a lot together. 
---
So I would like to be able to play with them, even when the other healer guy is on, or if he, as I suspect, rerolls.
---
&gt; they will give it at the last minute and my boss will knock back my leave.
---
Even worse, you plan your month-long holidays, and they say they're releasing it on the first day.
---
That's why I'm going in April this year.
---
Getting worldbuffs and all the grinding will be your dailies anyways.
---
Druid Nightelf was my first character to 60 I just can't do druid again.
---
I'm all for bear tanks, but bless whoever is willing for farm gnomergan for hours for a level 30 item over and over. I'll be rolling warrior myself.
---
but, didn't it require completing also all previous class quests, or something?
---
I mean.... I tanked Undead Strath one night on my shaman. Rock biter weapon + stone skin totem + earth shock + 5% chance to block attacks in the talent tree = super duper tanks goodness
---
I used to play healer and switched to dps, I love it but after playing hunter, lock and warrior I still prefer to play an hybrid dps like ele sham or balance drood because even if they do less damage than pure dps class the lack of healing spell is something I can't go through 
---
in STV
---
Hoping this happens for me in classic! I’m 35...
---
Draenei was shaman before Orcs
---
I always thought gnomes were for people who didn't care what their character looked like 😜
---
Perhaps the biggest issue is that Bears just flat out do more damage than warrior tanks, leading to quicker/easier runs.
---
Sunder Armor, Battle Shout and Demoralising Shout all do zero damage on application but are required to be spammed quite a lot. The only damage a Warrior tank does in an instance is basically auto attacks, the occasional cleave/heroic strike and Shield Slam if prot.
---
Bears tank almost entirely with Swipe and Maul, and scale much better with dps stats than Warriors. 
---
This may change of course if a warrior goes dual wield tank, and of course it's very dependant on overall gear selection, so it's not a universal truth. A super well geared warrior tank will likely outdamage a poorly geared Bear.
---
But in general your "average" bear tank will contribute a lot more damage to a run than your "average" warrior tank.
---
&gt; dailies end up being like logging in to Clash of Clans to clear away all the trees then logging back out.  
---
No. Dailies end up being a part-time job. With the difference that you don't get paid for it, and don't contribute well towards your resume.
---
I would argue that ever other melee suffers from a proper reck-bomb paladin.
---
Wow..
---
Thanks for sharing, these are excellent.
---
What is the point in no-lifing the game when your life will eventually restart and you'll be unable to no life it again. 
---
dont tank
---
Who's gonna tank ur dungeons
---
Mutilate? That is a TBC skill buddy :)
---
why nagas?
---
People who don't need convincing
---
12 btw
---
Okay have fun waiting an hour for a tank. I used to have to whisper warriors around the right level to find one
---
I think Warrior fits your bill, you can play arms all the time, be able to tank 5 man's, it's challenging in PvP but also is effecient in raids. 
---
Netherwing Drake was far from optional....
---
I've chosen my classes easily enough, but can't choose my faction :-( Properly stressed over it lol.
---
Mage is good, but is one dimensional in that you are a damage dealer. Druid offers a variety of spec's that you can play and although in raids they are generally thought of as healers and in PvP they are considered the best Flag Carriers, they offer a fair amount of versatility. 
---
I've read through the Mistborn series three times now. Love love love it. Rereading the first two in the Storm light Archives as well, then moving on to the third since I haven't read it yet. Sanderson is by far my favorite author! 
---
As another commenter said, Elantris is also a great read. Plus his novellas are very entertaining :)
---
what?
---
The dungeon daily quests in TBC was useful. Helped with getting a team together for the harder heroics which people tended to avoid.
---
I've played Hunter &amp; Warrior on Horde and really tried forcing myself to think *its not that bad*. Its not like I only tried till level 20 either I've raided on my hunter and got my warrior to high level.
---
But with saying all that I literally cant see myself playing anything other then Shaman, as you can see this is why its such a debacle
---
Nope.  Don't even know Preachgaming.  Retired from gaming after WoW, now just Fortnite a few hours a week.
---
It was my go to heal on vael on retail healing the rogue group. It was effective enough that when I missed a raid night due to work the priest that replaced me didn't do well seems the rogues complained. 
---
Other than Vael the only other useful thing I did was tag the invading enemies at the preopening of the dark portal before BC came out. I was able to get that tabard very fast compared to others waiting for tags. 
---
&gt; Now continuing on, the enchanting trinket should not be included on this list according to you since "you must be present/blacksmith" etc bullshit. Which is wrong... but let's say it is. You can spec out of enchanting immediately and still use the trinket to full affect. It isn't an enchanting required item.
---
OP's list has two conditions:
---
&gt; Items that you need the profession to get and/or to fully benefit from
---
The enchanting trinket meets the first condition which is enough to make the list.
---
And while I see your point about Weapon Chains and Skeleton Keys I still feel like Weapon Chains don't belong on the list and Skeleton Keys do because of *how* they are used. Being able to use a weapon chain wherever you are is far less of a convenience than being able to use skeleton keys wherever you are.
---
Yeah, the original trailer was so good, I wouldn't mind that.
---
But I'd be cool to see a ingame trailer for each content phase. They already have the Naxx trailer for phase 6.
---
Isn't this gonna be 1.12 ?
---
I personally haven't experienced this in WoW as I haven't played it, but this was absolutely the reason I moved from RuneScape 3 to OSRS. The game was and is riddled with dailies, weeklies, monthlies and everything in between. Having dailies etc. as the most efficient way to play a game really hurts my enjoyment of it.
---
Truly, I'm in the same boat.  I mained a Warrior on Nost, eventually became an OT for a Naxx guild... obtained a Nightfall and dps gear as well.  I was never able to keep up with our Fury Warriors though, even when I tried (probz a me problem).  I do enjoy tanking and I love me a Gnome Warrior with pink hair.  I also had a hard time farming gold as a Warrior (but I also didn't have a healer best friend - for Classic, I will).  But the idea of rolling a Mage and having it easy in terms of topping damage meters and farming gold is a huge attraction.  I'm really thinking of maining a Mage then making a Warrior alt.
---
This is the best time to be playing a prot war, they do crazy damage, as a tank, and they're still the angry pinball tank with an AOE stun that gets shorter the more targets you hit. 
---
It is the worst time to be playing a bear, they're both boring and not particularly strong, though they did get ursol's vortex. 
---
Hunters aren't particularly flash at the moment, unless you want to play survival, in which case, just play a melee. 
---
I have to say, it was FUN.  We had the whiners, and the "I'mma GONNA PWN U!" folks, but all in all it was just fun.  When we met in the BG's -- lordy, we all wanted the killing blow.  And Alliance ran it back to us as well.
---
But you have to remember, this was back when if you wanted an account on Horde and on Alliance -- you had to pay for two, separate accounts, so most of us just had the one and didn't have ways of 'spying' for locations.  When Vent became more popular, we would have folks jump on and state the location of XXX, but you had to move quickly.  Great memories.
---
It does matter a lot though. I can one full grinding enough demonic runes, night dragon's breath, elemental fire and gold for other consumes to have enough for a full months of MC/BWL raiding. With dailys, there is strong incentive to do them everyday regularly to be efficient. It's much less flexible than grinding.
---
I guess after trying you could get into liking another class, but faction always stays the same. Hope you’ll find a satisfying option!
---
i will very probably play rogue. i just played one to 60 on a private server cause i couldnt wait xD what i miss most is cloak of shadows followed by shadowstep. 
---
i just wanna get lit af and farm up some gold while listening to some tunes or catching up on netflix
---
That's nice but I'll be tanking. 
---
Skills &gt; gear
---
Replacing your T2 gloves with a quest blue from a silithus chain quest (#priest things)
---
yeah the bg queueing is a pretty big thing for me. but zen_gelactic said it very well. 'while I don't want them in Classic, I will severely miss them'
---
Jokes on you, I didn’t get my netherwing until WoD.
---
Hell, I didn’t get epic flying until I was 78.
---
This, plus I think class balance and class design in general were just better in TBC and Wrath. 
---
Look on the bright side, you'll have a ton of rested bonus xp
---
You're very optimistic about the release date, everybody knows it will be middle of September :p
---
not u
---
Definitely roll alliance - do remember that Vanilla Shaman is fairly different from BC-onwards Shaman due to the viability of certain specs so you may not even like the Vanilla version as much.
---
Main question - what is it about the playstyle you like. Tell me what spells you enjoy, which spec(s) you play. Is it the aesthetic or the playstyle? Do you see yourself as a pure DPS player, a hybrid, a healer? Do you like having huge amounts of buttons to press and lots of group buffing options or were you all about the smash/boom/explodey sounds of the elements.
---
Explain WHY you liked Shaman... maybe we can find elements of what you enjoy in a different class. Remember all classes in Vanilla were radically different to what they matured into later in WoW.
---
I hated dailies.  From the quests to the dungeons, I HATED dailies.
---
It was as if our own imagination on what to do and how to have fun was diminished and now we were being told what to do to get XXX reputation to receive XXX items.
---
Why would a warrior do such a stupid thing as MT? In PvP sure, been there, done that.
---
Thing is u cannot predict rng dmg. Ever heard of crushing blows and criticals? Druid has 1 way to deal with em 1 way only. Dodge. Have fun predicting a series of back to back crushings and crits because rng is fun.
---
In some ways it’s better than grinding mobs for hours for, let’s say tokens, to give to some npc for rep gains. In a perfect world the tabard system would still be available. That combined with whatever dailies are available for a faction was a perfect system imo.
---
I've been trying to force my self to think like that as well.
---
Roll a Tauren Shaman, Thunderbluff is probably my favorite Horde City and most aesthetically pleasing but every time I picture leveling in the Horde zones and running through the rest of the city's just leaves a YUKKKKK taste in my mouth
---
It's gonna be based mostly on the 1.12 data, but they'll be calling it 1.13.
---
This guide discourages Elemental shamans too much. They are really good (Although hard to call them actually elementals, they are doing damage more than healing, but more like a hybrid of Ele and Resto, you need Nature Swiftness in resto tree, doesn't mean it would stop you from disintegrating your enemies with enormous Chain lightning crits and being able to put a reasonable impact even with melee with ice brand weapon buff.
---
You will still need to carry two sets, there isn’t a whole lot of spell plate that I can think of tbh.
---
SM/Ruin Warlock fits what you are looking for. 
---
i assume thats a typo as theres no 1.13
---
can be shit if you're unlucky with pushbacks
---
Lok'tar ogar.
---
That is also true. I've regularly seen beartanks doing comparable damage as slacker damage dealers or okayish damage dealers with bad specs.
---
Not that big of a deal in a raid, pretty big difference in 5mans.
---
WSG medals coming at ya 
---
Horde isn’t so bad. I have no love for Orgrimmar but that’s where all the action will be. It’s no Ironforge, but it could be worse. It could be Undercity.
---
For Tanking:
---
- Easy to find instance groups.
---
- *Much* easier getting into raiding guilds and onto their main roster than as a Hunter.
---
- Probable support in levelling and gearing an alt from your guild, as most raiding guilds were sympathetic to the spec sacrifice their tanks and healers needed to make to make raids viable.
---
- Probable support (or more likely than Hunter) towards raid costs (eg repair, consumables) due to being non-viable in farming.
---
For Hunter:
---
- Easier to level even if getting instance groups isn't so easy.
---
- Raid spec is still a viable PvP spec.
---
- No need to level an alt for PvP or farming. Any alts you have will be because you want another class, not because your main has limitations.
---
- (This one strongly depends on whether the average age for Classic WoW matches the average age for Vanilla WoW) If you're even halfway decent at playing a Hunter you'll be substantially more skilled than the vast majority of Hunters, making it easier to stand out.
---
yeah forgot about that! ty
---
Balts Ank
---
idk, killing cyclonian with 2 lvl30 seems not possible. are you sure?
---
But by denying you access to something did it make you want it more?
---
Stage a kidnapping and hide at your best mates house in the basement with a poopsock
---
Especially now that we have so much digital media available. I can sit down for a long grind and binge a Netflix series/Podcast/etc. at the same time.
---
Why is this spec called Ele/resto and not “Restomental”? 
---
name checks out lmao
---
The transrace population has had it rough for a long time. You should organize a movement
---
I haven't specifically done world quests for a month now. I see them more as world events that I can do when I'm in the area and the task suits me. 
---
Still doing endcontent perfectly fine (HC raid + some m+ 11-15 dungeons). Cannot say they are mandatory to me. However I don't play the mission table. So I have no use for the war resources anyway.
---
You can surely find a few more people(even pay up if no friends|guildmates) for the boss, I was more talking about long ass grind of elementals.
---
Would be fun if they did the same as any other trailer for remastered games (show the old trailer with old graphics and shift them at every scene to the new graphics) but instead of new graphics it would shift to the same one.
---
And the last scene before the logo reveal it would say: (almost) the same game as 15 years ago!
---
Vanilla has all I need
---
Lol no, the Draenei didn't become shamans until after the fall of Shattrath.
---
You let mana regen. It’s actually 10 second CD but with permafrost the slow lasts 11 seconds. You constantly strafe a tight circle and keep them grouped up. Keep an eye out for resists because that’s when you need to pop frost nova. That’s why I recommend all the resist talents that help Frost spells.
---
So say you’re a relatively fresh 60. You can probably blizzard about 4-5 times before oom. CoC you can almost infinitely sustain. Blizzard farming is fast and effective if you’re well practiced on your spell ranges and freeze times, but only for normal mobs. You can’t really farm 6-7k hp elites like you can with CoC because you’ll oom. CoC averages more than one point of dmg to each mob per mana spent with the bonus of two mana regen tics. Blizzard  is close to same raw number efficiency, but you’re not going to get full damage out of every cast of it very often. It’s also just plan safer because you never stop moving to channel, so you can pull larger packs even when you’re learning the technique. Using both is optimal in mid levels. I wouldn’t say it’s an amazing method until 50, but CoC only farming is definitely worth trying.
---
I wish I was confident in my choice. I have a deep desire to be an Elemental Shaman in PvE and I know I'll have to heal at least the first two raids and very probably the last one.
---
True facts.
---
Oh, you want to get into raids? You’ll need to gain the trust of factions and do their attunement quests, not to mention grind mats all day for resist gear/pots.
---
Yeah, spending my game time herbing for hours was great fun. /s
---
There are certain aspects of WoW that may cloud our vision with nostalgia, but certainly not all of them. WoW has some real genuine strengths that are just as true today as they were in 2004.
---
Sometimes game design actually regresses for one reason or another. Let's not be blind to this by just saying "lol nostalgia". 
---
Anything 1lvl or higher over you clvl will be up in your face instantly. And forget about soloing elites :)
---
I can see going for Cresecent Staff, but its debatable if its worth regarding time spend getting it. 
---
Corpsemaker - sure. But then again you need ppl willing to pass the weapon to you and doing multiple runs just for you to get your weapon. The other weapons are fairly low drop % - there is no point in farming them. X'caliboar 20% from a rare mob - lul? Bonebiter is pretty good, alliance only tho.
---
Let's take them in the order you listed
---
*  Rogue - not really easy to level, have to respec for pvp and pve
---
* Hunter- THE BEST leveler, can PvE and PvP with the same spec MM/Surv. King of WPvP leveling, good but challenging at 60 
---
* Warlock - easy leveling, free mount at 40, SM/Ruin works for both PvP and PvE (not 1000 optimal for pvp)
---
* Shaman - terrible leveling experience, can use the same spec for PvP and PvE
---
* Mage - Good leveling, frost doesn't need to respec for PvP and PvE, top-end DPS, best quality of life
---
Based on the order you listed:  hunter, warlock, or mage.  Without respect to the order you listed:  Mage IMO.
---
Dailies... barf!
---
Good thing is you don't have to understand. You can bash private servers all you want but at least they gave me an opportunity to play the game I love not the crap that came after Vanilla and Burning Crusade. Blizzard threw away their own codes and claimed we don't want Vanilla for years so F these arrogant pricks. 
---
Now sharding, I don't trust them one second they gonna get rid of it after release time is over. If they do, I might consider playing on an official server, but it depends on how they handle it overall. 
---
My guys just flexing he has a SO XD
---
Shaman tanks arn't the best but also they arn't as god awful as paladin "tanks". I've seen shaman threat. I'd rather take a Shaman Tank than a Paladin.
---
Its crazy to think that most of us will have to spend 250+ hours just to get our character to level 60. Then to realise things are just getting started.
---
No changes! Bring on the original vanilla tailers!
---
No, I quite liked dailies. Rep grinds gated behind dailies were quite civilised compared to (Pre-AQ) Cenarion Hold, (Pre-Naxx) Argent Dawn, or Timbermaw, or Wintersaber.
---
The compulsion to play or fall behind wasn't caused, driven or exacerbated by daily quests. There are plenty of ways vanilla could trap you into that same mindset. 
---
Hell, look at the PVP Honor System that we're all so excited to see come back - the absolute ultimate in "cannot afford to take a singe day off" treadmills.
---
We were on emerald dream.  I honestly dont remember what weapons he used I think it might have been ironfoe.   But his dps was top notch.   
---

+1
---
The one problem with this is that you will be a decent way behind all the other warriors
---
They should turn into Bears... with Dwarf Heads.
---
Dailies are one of the worst innovations in the monetization of MMOs. By the time I finish them I'm bored but they design them to be rewarding relative to the amount of effort required. Some rep ones make sense but most are garbage that are designed to keep you logging in like a mobile game.
---
I can get behind thay
---
If i had to choose between friendly ret and toxoc rogue, id just find a different rogue tbh
---
Freaking definitely I'm excited about not having dailies. I mean you explained it spot on for me... dailies just simply were more binding than fun. I remember in Legion, when I hit level 110 and found out I had to keep doing quests my heart sank. I pretty much quit really shortly after that.
---
Yes I want to do quests, but I just pushed through grinding to level cap by doing quests...let me do what I want to do for one second before I go back to grinding quests every day for the remainder of the expansion lol. But of course at the point of Legion, the things I wanted to do didn't really exist anymore and I was too deluded to think the vanilla experience would return to retail wow.
---
I look forward to grinding the things I want to grind, world pvp'ing, getting challenged right away in dungeons, farming specific gear that 100% has the stats you expect, seeing living cities and zones again, no transmogs, tradeskills matter again, talent trees, and I could go on. Just can't wait!
---
They are both good, the question is do you want to have mobility and direct damage, or do you want to be more tanky, pet, and cast DoTs? 
---
thats nice pic
---
Do you playing for undead rogue IRL? 
---
&gt; I'd rather take a fun, funny, friendly retri than a toxic rogue
---
The real question is this. You have to choose between a fun, funny, friendly retri and a fun, funny, friendly. What do you choose? The rogue will do 4 times as much damage as the retri who is struggling to out damage the tank and will need on warrior pvp weapons.
---
I've always played Resto Shaman.
---
I like Shaman because its such a unique class and it provides things that no other class can provide.
---
Let me set the scene up for you,
---
You are in Gadgetzan you just leave the city, You see a Horde Mage he is killing a Human Warrior, The Warrior is almost dead you run up and chain heal him but then the Mage turns around to you and starts casting Fireball, You drop Grounding Totem BAMN Fireball gone, You Frost Shock the Mage, The Warrior charges him and starts attacking him, out of nowhere a Rogue pops out he back stabs you, You quickly chain heal the Warrior and yourself, You drop a Earthbind Totem and run away from the rogue while he is slowed, EarthShock the Mage BAMN! he is silenced, you and the warrior proceed to kill the mage, You and the Warrior turn to the Rogue but he has vanished into thin air to fight another day 
---
I guess I'm in the minority but I actually enjoyed doing the daily quests. Everytime they turned up being a huge zerg-fest with the horde, calling up friends and whatnot, escalating what would have normally been a "get X items, kill Y mobs" into a full scale war. I usually did them with friends and since they weren't hard at all, we used that time to chat and tell each other how the past day were, what we did and so on. It was like sitting down at a cafe with a friend telling each other the latest news. Plus, it was a nice way to get some extra gold for raid repairs.
---
Good points here and I agree. Horde has to deal with both Paladins and Priests dispelling/cleansing magic DoTs. You'll be fine as a human warlock. Remember, you can always recast fear 
---
That’s my problem with them. I go “okay I only have an hour of play time today.” And instead of doing something fun, I decide to do dailies, because there is an obligation to do them before any of the fun stuff. 
---
I’ll say I never did dailies in BC. They felt very optional, and I skipped them. In legion and bfa though...
---
Dont understand ‘hardware’
---
Just a system administrator I wouldn’t know exactly how this works.  
---
You act as if I do NOT want a beta so I can get my hands on it earlier.  I just stated that it will not happen
---
Those servers are ALL virtual machines.  Their infrastructure will not change based on a stress test or beta
---
The one good use of dailies I think was the daily heroic in TBC. Where other instances are easy to get groups for since you only have access to 1-2 instance at a given level, at 70 you had access to every single dungeon in the game as heroic. So the population was split over wanting to run everything. Dailys merged those people into a single pool looking to run the daily heroic and guarenteed you'd could at least get 1 heroic run in any given day you logged in.
---
It is the mobile game approach where you do a little everyday and get locked out eventually. Spend some money for boosts maybe. Only that you already pay for the game and pay every month too. 
---
I like healing so that isn't a problem for me, but i also like doing dmg.
---
I hope that you can find a guild that will let you be ele in raids without healing if possible.
---
Pff, casual, my favorite Elder Scrolls is Daggerfall alpha build.
---
I didn't really mind them in WotLK but every expansion after that they've been sort of a pain.
---
It was 100% optional. I got mine, though. I actually kinda enjoyed the egg hunt!
---
There's not really any healer that does great DPS to be honest, they get called meme specs. That being said, shaman get taken for their utility and probably is your best bet. After that shadow priest usually has a chance at one spot to help warlock damage. Then you have ret paladin and feral druid, and dead last balance druid.
---
In the end, play what you like and do the best you can and load up on consumables and be ready to rock. You'll have the most fun that way.
---
The thought actually did cross my mind xD, I work at a pizza joint.
---
I wouldnt do this at all! Everybody will after this in total different ways. You are brand marked!
---
True. Dailies are cancer.
---
Well it's down to which of the two you can live without. Is being a Shaman more important or is being Alliance more important?
---
They will remake the old video with better graphics, which you will see if you toggle updated graphics on
---
For years I wanted to see what everyone sees in witcher 3. I finally bought it on sale last year or so and played like 9 hours and something happened and I just hadn't had the urge to go back to it.
---
My first impressions were, potential for great storytelling but awful combat and controls. Then I was a little disappointed by many NPC's in towns having nothing or little to say. Maybe I just need to play it more and it opens up, but man 9 hours? I thought that was good enough to get into it.
---
The launch is worth no life, aftwards its mostly raid logging.
---
Show me where it was “patches out”
---
Theres much to do at 60, I have many plans ahead.
---
No, if your pet solo'd a mob you couldn't loot it
---
Balance.
---
Balance is what I will miss the most. Nowadays people cry out if we have a power-discrepancy of about 10% - this is just laughable compared to the non-existence of defined specialisations in classic.
---
I won't judge but really it's a game, it should be secondary not something you drop everything for 3 months. Good luck dude
---
Grinding, questing, professions, auction house, boosting. So many more options become viable. I get it though not everyone that plays WoW enjoys the gold farming elements so dailies cater to that group, and maybe they would be fine if they were TBC level prepatch 2.4 (IoQ) as it adds another level of farming that's not being abused to the point of causing server side inflation.
---
Magee are the most popular DPS class
---
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion here, but the only difference is that rep/rewards are not time gated via dailies instead you farm away as much as you want.
---
Hybrid mode would be ideal in my opinion, if you want mindlessly killing mobs for a few hours to gain some reputation, sure go ahead.
---
If you do the dailies you get a nice small boost.
---
That way you do what suits your needs best, or do both.
---
But who am I kidding, it will result in a min-max debate like everything. People will feel forced to do both to get it done as quickly as possible. 
---
I really want no breaks for atleast a month haha, I plan to run a top raiding guild. Many things to do.
---
Mitch?
---
Hmm, i may have dropped the ball and told my boss about classic. 
---
But i like this one. Since ive been depressed before, even went to the doctors for it.
---
Hm. I wasn't thinking about the vanity pets. I certainly wouldn't play if there were anything like transmogs in a cash shop. I don't know about the vanity pets. I would probably still play if the shop was limited to them, but the idea bothers me. It seems antithetical to the vanilla philosophy where everything your player has is something that has been earned in game.
---
Also a good priest can fear you into mana burn spam when you powershift
---
weird shaped flag runners
---
That's what I'm saying I can't live with out either.
---
I might just have to not play classic /thread
---
Maybe get my mate to run over one of my legs. Hmmm
---
Become a teacher. I get 2 months off a year.
---
Dailies killed the social aspect and "game"ness of it a bunch for me.  Friends would sign on, I'd whisper them saying "hey, let's go run a dungeon / farm stuff / gank Alliance / whatever".  And they'd respond along the lines of "I gotta get my dailies done".  It was depressing.
---
I like feeling I’m playing a game and not working a second job. Can’t wait. 
---
Aww man prepping the man cave has got me excited.
---
I am thinking of playing priest and do healing pve at 60. My concern is if I am still able to farm stuff for gold using my holy spec. Or do I need to constantly respec?
---
You kinda left off the part where he said I only have an hour to play today.... so yeh you have down time where stuffs done because you probably play more than him. He logs in and probably has a bunch of chores to do to make sure he doesn’t fall to far behind and so misses out on doing the things he wants to do. 
---
If you truly can't live without either then yes, I'd suggest Classic isn't for you. Maybe one day they'll bring out TBC servers, but if your current state of mind is "Alliance Shaman or nothing at all" then the answer is "nothing at all".
---
&gt;Hydrocane: Staff that gives the wearer underwater breathing.
---
Is there something that boosts your swimming speed too ? Farming stranglekelp is such a chore if you're not a druid !
---
Some laxative and playing stomach flu will probably net you up to a week. They can't risk someone sick working at a pizza joint I'm sure. 
---
It's certainly possible, but I think the best way to go is to respec to prot for some time. Just makes tanking more enjoyable.
---
You can´t HANDLE a release date lol
---
Thats sick! Too bad about pay though ;(
---
it will probably kill me but it will be a satisfying death
---
Imagine Blizzard trolling and making the release date  August 31st.
---
That would suck.
---
Now imagine that the release date would be June, first week or so.
---
Oh yeh playing the game and having to actually put forth effort rewards is fun and satisfying. 
---
Good rogues use CD's, great rogues use CD's and Iron Grenades ;)
---
Frost = kill 2 mobs - drink
---
Fire =  kill 1 mob - drink
---
Pets do tag mobs, but if you do no damage them you cant loot.  Simple fix to afk farming
---
Where I am isn't too bad surprisingly. Best of both worlds really.
---
And when the next season comes out your get to grind them more because azerite power. 
---
That sounds wonderful
---
Ive read about the sm/ruin but it is also no where close to the True SL potential of warlock pvp according to my understanding. I think i would just feel gimped knowing I can play a much stronger pvp build but in terms of compromising with not having to respec this might be a good way to go.
---
Mage might look better according to earlier replies tho?
---
Thanks in advance. 
---
I'm really considering that as an option stupid as that may sound, 
---
I'll see as the release gets closer If I can't make my mind up I wont even play
---
true story my friend got me WoW for Christmas because I asked for it previously after giving up runescape and my parents said 'we can't pay for another subscription!" but because I'd been gifted the game they ended up paying for sub. 
---
Very interesting, thank you. So two things leap out at me - either you're primarily interested in the PvP side and the wealth of options available to you, or you're a healer at heart but also relish having more "cool things to do" regardless of pvp or pve.
---
Three classes leap out at me that fulfill the above.
---
Warlock, and this would be my recommendation - although it's not a healer, Vanilla Warlock has an absurdly big toolkit when you factor in the cool things each pet can do, and you could easily fashion a tale like the above. Though said tale may end up with a very dead rogue too. Obviously Alliance warlocks have it a bit harder due to Will of the Forsaken, but that's not a deal breaker and there'll likely be far less warlocks on alliance side anyway so you'll get easy raid spots. 
---
An old acquaintance of mine from back in Vanilla (legendary gnome warlock Binkydawds from earthen ring EU if you're still out there) said one thing once that stuck with me to this day. "If Warlock wasnt so complicated and interesting I'd have quit WoW months ago".
---
If you're a pure healer at heart, the two classes that ARENT Druid (i saw your "not again" post below) are Priest and Paladin, and both mighthave their interest.
---
Priest is a bit more straightforward and likely wouldnt have quite as much utility but when you consider the sheer number of heals you have, the dispels, the fears, the Mind Control, a good priest with access to all their skills from Vanilla (especially if Dwarf but dont feel obliged to roll dwarf) has a pretty big and interesting toolkit.
---
Paladin you've decried but Holydins were the only truly viable spec for paladin back then, and maybe a healydin focus might get away from some of the stereotypes you dont like. For sure a paladin has a lot of utility spells in Vanilla and if you just enjoy straight PVP healing then you'll probably be best off trying the invincible platies. Stuns, Auras, blessings for days, maybe not as interesting a toolkit as the Shaman but if you consider the holydin's entire underused kit and not just the flash of light spam you may find something there.
---
Seriously though, consider Warlock. I think it may be your jam if you don't mind deviating from the healer role.
---
Low brain solution. You set up your computer in the bathroom.
---
Hey man, there's no dailies but those black lotuses, e'kos and worm meats aren't going to farm themselves. 
---
Thank you. From what u and others taught me thus far im leaning towards mage or Hunter. 
---
Don't worry about it. You just want to have a shield and 1h in your bank during leveling and later on you probably want to start building up your tank gear on the side. It just makes things smoother/safer to have some tank gear. But you won't get "rekt" in 5mans if you keep doing them regularly (every leveling dungeon once) and learn the game, regardless of your spec.
---
The part where dungeons get a bit more challenging is after 40ish. Scarlet Monastery is in my eyes the last "real" leveling dungeon in terms of difficulty and especially gear requirement. Then it starts to ramp up a little each dungeon and you should be start looking into keeping decent tank pieces in your bank for when you wanna clear a dungeon.
---
as a warlock, this is why i'm looking forward to vanilla. :)
---
rogues feel impossible sometimes, they felt even worse in TBC.
---
Take 3 months off to build your career and get a better job!
---
While that may be true for some, I returned to private servers and the bad things aren't nearly as bad as I remembered them.
---
Well Met
---
Yep, I recently re-logged in on the free weekend. And immediately hit with a big 'shopping list' of things to do.
---
Invasion quests
---
Emmisery quests
---
Daily Heroic
---
Weekly warfront
---
LFR
---
World quests
---
Resource hand in
---
Weekly azerite island invasions
---
etc etc....
---
Yes, it's 'content' but it's just a big old list of things to work through, time and time again.
---
Once I feared a rogue that was gathering a Black lotus, got the lotus and /laught, bastard was soo mad that he ganked me multiple times 
---
Im not to interested in tanking and will play a lot solo so I dont think warrior is the way to go for me. To my understanding the leveling is rough If u are solo and also the most gear dependant class. 
---
He said that a druid cant kill them since druids lack the burst, but that says nothing about them being able to kill the duid at all.
---
Be cause of multiple maths done since you last played 15 years ago.
---
[guide](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/) 
---
Just document yourself a bit.
---
don't you play with my feelings like that :(
---
Whatever you do, do not *cancel* that work trip. 
---
Professions and alts
---
Yes and no. I loved the feeling of having something daily to do in WoW when I wake up. Now I have to find that for myself. On the other hand it got pretty overwhelming at times.
---
Do you have the maths behind that?  
---
Not doubting you, just curious as to how you'd calculate its actual DPS boost.
---
• Work
---
• Top raiding guild
---
Pick one and you are good to go.
---
I’ve tried to not attack retail and have a live and let live approach.  I haven’t played retail since Cata so I’m way out of touch with it.  That said I reinstalled and booted up one of my old 19 twinks since I wouldn’t have to resub to do so.  I got to looking at the changes I could see and chatted with one of my old friends during it who still plays.
---
Are these spec locked out abilities viewed favorably?  I hopped on my priest and it appears healing spells don’t work at all in the shadow spec, and when I asked about where my auras were to my friend he said they removed most class specific buff stuff like that.  Not to mention my gear was pretty much unrecognizable with stats and such.....oh yeah and he said +hit isn’t a thing anymore since we never miss now?
---
Give me classic y’all, I don’t want what I was seeing in retail.
---
Yeah don't do it. You'll not only be slower individually, because it isn't a good AoE spec. But you'll also be less useful in 5man dungeons.
---
I mained a warrior in TBC without a farming alt (rolled on fresh server at release). Dailies were what I did to get gold for raiding expenses (and all to frequent respecs for PvP). I liked it fine and there wasn't really anything I could solo for a better return (at least once Primal Mana prices dropped, I made great money with those). Major plus was I got exalted with Skyguard by the time I could afford epic flying, so I went straight for a red Nether Ray!
---
Wrath was way too much though. Sometimes it felt like there was nothing else to do.
---
Interested in this too!
---
&gt;Blizzard Entertainment proudly invites you to experience Warcraft from a whole new perspective. Stake your claim; live the legend. A world awaits. The world of warcraft. 
---
It´s perfect
---
it is just so annying in bgs. you can kill a wl or spriest and rly dominate them, but if they just have 1 second to dot you, you are either dead, cause you cant stealth for 20 seconds and some enemies are near or you are forced to sit in a corner and wait 20 seconds while eating. 
---
Anything up to and including entry level raiding can be done as arms or fury with a sword and board and plate sta gear (take off that dps leather etc)
---
Scholo / Strath can be a bit dicey but every dungeon up to that point is a joke really
---
I'm in the same boat, planning on tanking on a warrior. I've heard others plan on selling dungeon runs like SM to others. Thats about it from what I've seen other than professions and leveling alts.
---
Tanks can always sell dungeon runs, either for gold outright or by reserving things like Righteous Orbs. Pretty reliable way to make gold &amp; contacts.
---
Yea hunters scale really poorly.
---
Just by and large be a decent person. A huge part of what made Vanilla great was a sense of community that has been entirely abandoned in retail. Communicate with others on the server, outside of your guild, make friends, and help one another out. Help out that rogue who has run Deadmines 20 times to get the Cruel Barb just to have a hunter steak it every time, group up with people doing quests so you can help each other complete them instead of stealing mobs from one another, ask and answer questions that people have - I’ve played a ton of Vanilla but it’s been years and years and a lot has happened in my life since that time so I know a lot and I’ve forgot a lot, be a community that works together off each other’s expertise. 
---
But most importantly, HAVE FUN. It’s just a game and let it be that, sure we may argue that it’s the greatest mmorpg ever made, but it is still just a game who’s purpose is entertainment. 
---
On PvE servers you could.
---
Indeed, people merely chain themselves to dailies.  Grinding is grinding.  You do it if you want to do it.  Hell, at some point I realized that even many of WoW's normal quests themselves, even in Classic and especially those with variable quest item drop rates, are modified versions of pre-WoW MMORPG grinds that took up 95% of MMORPG gameplay back then.  Of course, it's still nothing like pre-WoW MMO grinds, but still, it ends up playing out similarly.  The low drop rates for some quest items are very deliberate and not an oversight.
---
Based on what I've seen on here. Pretty sure you can do jump runs in dire maul for gold as holy.
---
You could farm Arcane Crystals or Dreamfoil/Mountain Silversage/Black Lotus/Plaguebloom/Ghost Mushrooms etc. Or just do dungeons DM:E jump runs, tribute runs but even BRD can be quite lucrative.
---
You don't really have to farm mobs to get money.
---
The better the group, the less points you need in prot.
---
For example:
---
you mark skull for maintarget, red crpss for 2nd killtarget, moon for sheep, green square for trap.
---
You are star for great visibility.
---
Now the rogue or mage may be pulling aggro off the killtarget, but you can just taunt every 10sec keep the mob on you.
---
If you have noobies attacking both skull and red cross while breaking a CC, things get hairy fast. Now you need to scramble for potentially 3 loose mobs while your inferior threat generation barely is enough for 1 mob.
---
In guild dungeon groups with good player you know: any spec goes
---
In pugs with potential noobs endangering you and the healer by overpulling: prot really is the better option.
---
Rest in peace in peace ? :D
---
50 g is the respec limit in vanilla wow
---
thats a fair amount of gold and it adds up quickly when you're doing it multiple times a week...especially only to respec 
---
i would just spec arms and wear a sword and shield to tank 5 mans
---
as a warrior you're going to need that gold for BOEs / consumables / enchants
---
I don't mean to sound racist.
---
_always sunny in philadelphia theme_
---
Proceeds to be racist.
---
Paladin: Brain dead, spam flash of light and buff 
---
Druid: Decent , timing healing touch can be tricky, innervate your best healer/dps and not much
---
Shaman: haven’t played but I heard is decent, spam chain heal and keeping the right totems
---
Priest: “hardest” in my opinion, even tho is not that hard, spam heal, keep renew, you have a lot of spell management, but at least for me is fun
---
At least on a recent private server I was able to farm gold as Holy. Probably wasn't the quickest route but I just farmed fire elemental's in Un'Goro one at a time for their crafting materials that they drop. A good wand is all that you need. You can also farm Dire Maul with Holy Nova but I believe you need a large mana pool so it's difficult to do as a fresh level 60.
---
Tagging /u/barue 
---
IQD on my server was a blast! Always group PvP going on.
---
Think of classic wow as a form of archaeology. If you do that, you'll realize how wrong you are.
---
We did it as a two man, rogue/warrior at level 34 (the whole chain). I don't think it would be possible to do it lower than that without a healer.
---
Forgot about dispells, pally can dispell magic, diseases and poison from friends, shaman can purge magic from enemies and some totems can cleanse, Druid can dispell curses and poisons, priest can dispell magic and diseases from friends and purge magic from enemies 
---
There always be more work and nobody ever said on his deathbed "geez I wish i spent more time at work".
---
However there will be only one release of WOW classic for at least the next 15 years !
---
Let's hope so! We should be in bound for a release date this month for sure!
---
Yea I know some servers had issues but in the grand scheme it was great afaik :) 
---
What attunement do you speak off?
---
Onyxia is the only long questchain and does not involve any rep farm.
---
For BWL you can just do UBRS once and that's it. (and you don't need it either, its just a teleport)
---
MC attunement is one BRD run. (and you don't need it either, it's just a teleport)
---
Only rep-related thing is the aqual quintessence for MC. But to my knowledge you don't need it yourself, only 7 people from the raid, correct?
---
Dailies are lazy content, and the reason why I quit. I want to do new stuff, that I decide to do. I don’t want the best thing to do to be handed to me on a silver platter, day after day. They broke my immersion so hard I realized that I was wasting my time with the game, so I quit. This is an MMORPG, not some cell phone game.
---
Endgame zones where you can farm mobs for loot may seem like lazier content, but it is emergent content that the player can choose to do, among many many other things. World pvp happens, min-maxing happens, and I can try to figure out what is most efficient for my playstyle. If the most efficient path forward is OVERWHELMINGLY the same quest I did yesterday, or the day before, or last week, even if they are switched up, that is not fun. Choosing to farm somewhere though, is still fun, because it is my choice. I’m out in the world, no one is telling me what to do.
---
I don’t want 10 similar choices to cycle through, I want 200 choices to decide from, each of which are different and exist in the world, and I want to feel special that I chose to do this rare thing. I want to do profs. I want to do the AH. I want to do pvp sometimes. I want to farm rep killing mobs. I don’t want to have a neon sign telling me to do a daily first, and make the reward so good I feel like I’m wasting my time unless I do exactly that, even if there is some minor variation day to day.
---
Sometimes I just want to grind a random mob for a random element or essence, because it’s expensive on the AH. That’s what an MMO can provide, a world where there are many choices, a market to let people interact with the choices they make, and prices to encourage you to do the hard/rare stuff. Free market is infinitely better than any rotated assortment of daily quests with stupidly valuable rewards.
---
Up to this day I rate daily quests on the same level of 'this is bad' as the addition of flying. They've caused about the same level to the game as a whole
---
Daily quests were the first tombstone for the game's economy. Here you can print 100-150g per toon per day for minimal effort. Oh look the gold prices for everything explode because everyone can print money - who would have thought? \~.\~
---
They also opened the gates for time gates on reputations
---
I'm a Healer at heart. 
---
I've always been Healer or Tank the satisfaction you get when playing them is through the roof compared to DPS. 
---
I like your Warlock Idea but I have never been able to play a Spellcaster in any games that I have played, I just don't fit the playstyle.
---
The Priest Idea I thought about but the class is pretty straight forward.
---
Paladin like you said is only Holydins and you are literally a buffing machine.
---
After reading what you wrote I am leaning towards rolling a 
---
Tauren Shaman and Alliance X and just playing them both at the same time, that way I'll truly know which one I want to play after a while with out having disdain for the other.
---
Classic WoW has been delayed until summer 2020.
---
Dailies were super useful for me in TBC as a warrior main without a farm alt, but I never had an issue grinding when it was worth it. Vanilla was my third MMO and WoW was *way* less grindy than what I was used to (EQ and Shadowbane).
---
&gt;nd misread this, good night p
---
Yeah I currently play retail as well.  I LOVE shadow priests and their design philosophy from legion so I definitely have invested interest.  Just wanted to explain why the games are different and why Classic fits the MMO mold better than retail currently.  
---
Except that it’s not. If you’re leading a top raiding guild, you’re going to need to be available all the time. It ends up being another full time job managing people, consumables, drama, raid set up. Believe me, I’ve done it.
---
Shaman can't as mana tide resto spec is dreadful for PvP.
---
I know they said they would contain sharding to starter areas. The problem I have is that sharding is (and has been for a while now) their answer to server stability.
---
I have doubts that they can make Classic stable *without* sharding when they can't even make retail stable *with* sharding. Lower tickrates will help but it's not a certainty until we see it happen.
---
The question is: what do you want from the game? Maintan or offtank?  
---
Especially maintank is fiercly competitive and the earlier you are 60, the better as warrior.
---
Furies will struggle with farming dal'rends, truestrike and other highly rolled for items.
---
Aspiring maintanks will struggle securing a spot if they are late to the early guild forming phase.
---
Also while farming dungeons for gear, you don't really need a farming alt yet, because you net a fair amount of gold by just grinding it for gear. 
---
If you prefer a farming alt I'd go warrior first, gear him, get raid ready, secure your raid spot, then level a hunter or mage quickly to 60.
---
Over the years this game earned its place as an mmorpg masterpiece and then devolved  into an all-accessible fantasy treadmill. 
---
The majority of good goold/hour methods are completely independand of your class/spec. In my eyes these are the big money makers from experience:
---
1. efficient 5 man dungeon runs
---
2. gear crafting makes tons of money especially in the first year or so
---
3. consumable crafting (alchemy/cooking/fishing) makes very good money all the time
---
4. herb/ore gathering makes consistent, good money
---
5. enchanting/disenchanting is probably the best money maker in the game but also the biggest investment
---
If you don’t like org, that’s fine, as soon you get to 40, set your hs in Kargath, at least in meanie private servers there was always a mage willing to do portals for 1g,
---
No one else misses rogues having those spells. At all.
---
It's really awesome, the downside on alliance is healing paladins seem to be more mana efficient in PvP, can handle melee attacking them much better with plate armor, and can dispell those annoying poisons like viper sting.
---
However, spam dispelling mages, warlock, and druid buffs is FUCKING LOL insane awesome
---
i bet i am not the only one ;)
---
Dailies make gold farming a chore.  Without them, players are free to farm gold in ways that make sense to them -- selling lower level instance runs, key services, or just going on Mining/Herbalism gathering binges.  These are examples of emergent gameplay at it's finest.
---
YES. Dailies are the main reason I stopped playing. If I am busy and can’t log in to do dailies every day, I can’t keep up with rep grinds that I want to, or whatever progress is now steered at dailies. 
---
You and every rogue player, yes. No one else misses those spells.
---
Hey Classic, I played Vanilla - WotLK, and now Legion - BfA, and quit in December. Used gold to buy a month over the weekend and now I'm dicking around with a Zandalari Rogue ahead of Classic (where I want to build a Rogue main). I'm not sure what the daily threads are, but I feel like this can fit in here.
---
I checked out the "Life at 60" guide for Rogues and saw some comments alluding to Raiding groups not taking in dagger rogues due to lower DPS, so I'm looking for help to build two optimal sub-classes to rotate between. One for PvP / WPvP that specializes in daggers and Subtlety, and a Sword build for raiding / dungeons.
---
I never played a vanilla rogue, so choosing the optimal path for dps is fairly tricky for me since I don't know the skill trees. It would be nice to have a bit of foresight going in, even though half the fun of Vanilla was stumbling my way through without guides. I'm 30 and don't have time for that now, lol.
---
Alright thanks for the answer m8 !
---
My priest will be a tailor/skinner until 60, then I'll swap skinning for engineering to help in PVP. You'll gain about 20g from vendoring leather by the time you hit lvl40. I'm expecting to send any greens I make with tailoring to a lvl5 alt with disenchanting.
---
&gt; Sure you can go grind whatever for gold or reagents, but its up to you. 
---
same for dailies tho
---
what makes my statement true :)
---
But if he cancels that work trip there might not be a WoW Classic release. 
---
You can /cry when your dead?
---
Brandon Sanderson is my fav fantasy author. Enjoy 
---
You are correct, I remembered Draenei teaching Orcs the practice. But it was used by the orcs first.
---
If you like DotA, try ability draft. It's super fun if you know the heroes in &amp; out. I may be biased since I played it in the WC3 days. My friends and I have made it our typical game to play together
---
Hmmm yeah it might be less true horde side with windfury
---
Prot and heal is a failsafe for bad plays. With no mistakes made you don´t need it. When you pull your mates from the friendslist and know what you get it will work. 
---
Sorry bud but you don’t have enough time to run a hardcore raiding guild.
---
Taking months off of work is just not feasible.
---
Exactly. I used to gem farm on my rogue in one of the area 52 dungeons so I never actually needed those quests. 
---
Best answer. 
---
we have no idea how lucrative dungeon farming will be
---
My comment original included that its not funny, just relative. But then I thought about it and realized it is funny..so very logically funny..lol.
---
The biggest factor I'd say is your own personal dedication to leveling and maintaining a good xp/hour. I know warriors who never ding 60 with more than 7 days played and hubters who struggle to get it below 12. If you follow a good guide, ignore professions, always log off in an Inn, etc... You can get 60 really fast on any class.
---
Why would they want to change anything about this?
---
&gt; If you prefer a farming alt I'd go warrior first, gear him, get raid ready, secure your raid spot, then level a hunter or mage quickly to 60.
---
when will u have time to pay for raid requirements when u level an alt? its not even worth leveling one for gold. the hundreds of hours it takes to level an alt is better spent farming gold with a subpar class.
---
I'm going gnome mage main, dwarf priest alt. Stoked!
---
You mean reading barrens chat. 
---
People still raid pretty much all the tiers of content, some people will be progging MC while others have already cleared naxx, and naxx guilds still frequently do older content because certain pieces are BiS forever anyway (stuff like Thunderfury makes MC kinda relevant forever)
---
warriors are just as capable of picking herbs and mining and skinning and killing humanoid mobs etc as any other class
---
slower? yeah
---
less efficient? yeah
---
but its not like its impossible
---
plus tanks make their money by selling their services to run level 60 dungeons and reserving righteous orbs and shit
---
Sure , let’s put a shaman in front of patchwerk /s
---
Look at the BIS items for druids before raids and in bowl, and you will see that druids are really powerful for raiding in MC, a bit less in BWL, regain strength in AQ in 2.5, and ok in Naxx. 
---
Once you are stuffed, TPS is more important than mitigation and druids become much more interesting.
---
Have a look at skarm videos, that tanks the 3 classes. It’s quite enlightening
---
To a daily task or tasks is just lazy game mechanics in any game, it is weird to me to think anyone on earth likes the idea of playing a game where you may see people online just to do a daily or two then log out, that isn't a game anymore is it? It is a chore 
---
For a Gnome, Barrens chat is usually pretty dead. :(

Yes it is that hard, don't do it. People run low level dungeons if they have the quests, otherwise the XP sucks BAD. How do they do it without being spec heal? They are careful and don't zerg like retail idiots. You are careful with pulls, you use CC, mark targets, wait for the healer to have mana before moving forward and the same for DPS that use mana like mages. If DPS act like dipshits then you kick them because they are a dime a dozen and good luck if you don't listen to the tank and they decide to leave.
---
This is not retail, this is vanilla. You have your shit wired tight or you wipe. Nobody wants to wipe. People listen to the tank and do their jobs correctly or they get a reputation as an idiot, will be on everyone's ignore list, and will never get into other instances unless they group with other idiots in which case they will keep wiping.
---
7.3.5 :(
---
Its not about progres, its about raid times and clear times. So-called HC guilds will be able to clear AQ40-BWL-MC within one night once its on farm status, Just because they are more efficient. Casuals will do this one by one and spent 3 X more hours... Who is HC then? 
---
I feel the same. As the game went on and people got older and got jobs, we didn’t have time to sit and play for 4-8 hours a day, so if I only had an hour, I wanted to do something fun, not feel compelled to have to do dailies to keep up with everyone else. 
---
They can't parry OR block. Nor can they get anywhere near defense cap. Hence they're way more susceptible to crushing blows than a Warrior.
---
IIRC someone compared Naxx logs one time and found that the Druid tank was taking somewhere around 30% more damage than the Warrior tanks were.
---
balanced because everyone is overpowered at their own thing :)
---
I mained priest in Vanilla, but last time I played on a private server i ended up rolling a lock and i fucking loved it lol. Not having to find a group to quest/ level was so nice :p
---
I highly doubt they give any recognition to Nostalrius when deciding on what will be/is a multi-million dollar project's release date.
---
i guess that makes sense :P
---
Heroic leap and charge in combat for warriors

First off, internet gaming disorder wasn't added to the DSM-5, it was added specifically to section 3 of the DSM.  Section 3 is for potential disorders that require more literature to support actually being added or not. 
---
You're right that video games can't CAUSE addictions physiologically like drugs can but they CAN cause behavioural addictions.  [This is a great starting point to read about this.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395614002027).  There are many theories for such addictions, such as [self-determination theory](http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory/).  However, the causal relationship between video games and addictions in terms of functionality isn't something to get hung up on.  
---
You also state that the inclusion of IGD is bound to cause misunderstanding and ignorance.  Serious, publishing psychologists are not the normal public.  [Psychological scales are required to be tested and validated using psychometrics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.12457).  It's math, not feelings.  You claim that requiring 5 of 9 criteria may result in over-diagnosis without acknowledging that clinical judgement plays a role in any diagnosis.  As with most (if not all) diagnoses in the DSM-5, there is a certain level of impairment or distress required for a given diagnosis to be made.
---
Your bias comes in again when you state that "gamers are as healthy as other demographics" and yet again fail to see the need for a diagnostic tool for those who AREN'T.  This isn't for regular people, [it's for those who aren't](https://www.newsweek.com/2014/08/15/korean-couple-let-baby-die-while-they-played-video-game-261483.html).  You seem to be new to the field, but psychology is never black and white and there is always nuance.  Black and white claims like "there is no such thing as WoW addiction" is simply not possible to support when the literature clearly documents addictive symptoms in internet gaming.   You would benefit from removing yourself from your bias a little and looking at this objectively, as you're clearly very unwilling to see video games as a problem at all.  I've tried to use sources that would be available without a subscription.  Feel free to use published literature to disprove my claims if you disagree, I'm certainly not an expert in this field and am open to admitting I'm wrong.
---
Yea, I misread ya because I see so many people whine about retail and how its literally the worst thing ever conceived by the human mind. I just get sick of reading it haha. I just don't play retail for the MMORPG factor, I play it for the MMOcollection factor. That wasn't the reason I started playing, but its the reason I still do.
---
DM:E jump runs are commonly done as fury warrior or rogue and a healer, you could do it as 3 man with a tank, but then you split it 3 ways instead of 2.
---
Dank 👌
---
This is a really good point. I think a warlock could probably manage it due to the free mount but it would still be hard. On a fresh server I suppose you could sell a lot of wands to make up for it.
---
Hey guys so i need small help to decide which class to play ,as many of us :). So far im looking for good support class in pvp/wpvp , decision will be on Druid or Shaman. Focusing on good mobility,heals and helping other classes, but option to respec to have solid damage also. And at last which alt class would fit with Shaman or Druid to have ?
---
Ah, the Quel'Danas days.
---
I remember asking a coworker what he was doing after work.
---
He said he had to do his dailies.
---
I started laughing hysterically.
---
I was a scrub though and thought his dedication was awesome. Nice kid. Hope he is doing well.
---
Do it like me: 
---
\- all bank alts in Thunder Bluff 
---
\- HS in Kargath
---
\- preferably inviting orcs and trolls over undeads (hate them wimpy little fellas). Obviously tauren are #1 pick for group invites
---
\- make sure to be remembered by pug leaders, so you don't have to go back to Ogrimmar for inspection, you whisper him and he invites you
---
\- get a warrior buddy to farm DM:E. Mages can make portals to Thunder Bluff without you having to set foot into Orgrimmar
---
\- visit alliance zones once a week and breathe the fresh air of Redridge mountains and Elywnn Forest. Duel in in the frozen streams of Dun Morogh or infront of the mighty walls of Stormwind
---
\-Be offline listening to raid comms to know when to log in in Orgrimmar to receive dragon slayer buff and immediately take off to more sophisticated zones like Jojamba island in STV for Hakkar heart.
---
TL;DR It's really easy to avoid the poo-ridden pigsty that is Orgrimmar.
---
Beeing exalted myself with ogri'la by grinding the 'Simon says' daily, i'm gonna say perfection might be a bit of a stretch....
---
What people always overlook is WotF has a 2min cooldown, 120 seconds is sooooo much time! Just get some space and recast fear
---
Also people in high end guilds are always raiding the content because it's so fast, there's nothing else to do raidwise and they're always gearing up alts :)
---
I think it is a little overblown when people say that mages are super popular. Sure, there will be a good chunk of them. Ones that are committed to raiding? that's a little different story. Guilds will be looking for good dedicated mages during all of classic. 
---
That is what is interesting about the class polls and stuff. They are fun to look at but it would be more interesting to see who actually makes it to 60 and then who is actually committed to raiding. There will be a lot of mages that just mess around in WPvP or just farm gold for a main.
---
Gotta love those thunderfury runs with 20 alts 
---
Ehhh, dailies are fine in small amounts.
---
Yes, and that blue post mentions several things that were reported but were working as intended.............so.....................
---
There's a point where the issues in Classic become so hard to notice that it's simply impossible to spot them without being able to compare them to the reference client. Blizzard will easily be able to reach that point with just internal testing alone. A public testing period would thus not reveal much of importance, just lots of false positives like the warlock pet summon and charge mechanics in the demo.
---
They should be able to parry and block when their face
---
1. Professions
---
2. Alts
---
3. Dungeon runs (just spaming, reserving stuff, or selling tanking service)
---
4. Respecing (takes 100 gold at worst to spec to dps and return to tanking which is usually about 2-3 hours of farm, depending on raid schedule can be doable)
---
5. AH manipulations
---
6. Good guids will help out their MT with consumables and/or gold.
---
7. Regular farming (just slower)
---
You won't miss a thing. You can get into a good raiding guild that is in BWL with just pre-raid bis. A BWL guild will still be doing MC for sure. 
---
Also, blue 2h weapons are like 12g at a vendor, so just get one of those and whatever other random blues you win. 
---
Fuck ya. Thanks for helping me kill the first few hours of work today.
---
The idea is that you defend your raid spot by 95% attendance and have some people help you level your alt from time to time. 
---
You can do it as fast 1day15hours with a dedicated helper. 
---
Obviously there are other farming alternatives like Strat:UD as tank, tank + healer strat:live reserve runs etc. etc., but mage or hunter is just very convinient, because you don't have to rely on the server population and peak times in the evening to get the farming under your belt. 
---
A farming alt can be great. Not to mention funneling professions into him like alchemy for an increased profit.
---
Don’t spec that far into resto and still get a raid spot. Go elem/resto.
---
I provuded evidence the public testung was necessary.  You typed a lot of periods.  
---
Hmmm.
---
But you are faster with 3 than with 2, although you might run into lockout if you are too fast.
---
You can MT UBRS as Fury if you get enough gear. Focus on getting items with +def, then either block/dodge/parry. But, 350 defense is more than enough for everything up to MC. 
---
That is a beautifully-worded and accurate metaphor!
---
Shaman! Yes! Nearly 100 episodes, ready for that milestone.
---
Nope. It's legit and there *is* a 1.13.  
---
Currently it's the version of Classic Blizz are working on and that players got to experience in the Demo (It showed '1.13' in the loading screen).  
---
1.12 will forever be the vanilla patch, 1.13 is that same patch but running on the new architecture Blizzard has today. Whilst it all should feel the same during play, the underlying tech is almost 100% different and as such it has a new tag.  
---
Tech wise, Classic will be known as 1.13
---
Thanks!
---
Hmm, faction sounds wayyy more important to you than class imo so definitely go alliance. You said in a comment you're a healer at heart, dwarf priests are said to be the best, plus u can spec shadow priest if u want to do damage, or if you want a more hybrid class then consider a night elf druid, their restoration spec is strong plus you'll have fun with the option to tank/dps
---
For PvP both shaman and Druid are solid. If you went with an ele/resto shaman build you would have both the support/heal options AND serious burst DPS if you found yourself alone. Best of both worlds in PvP. 
---
Druid has a good bag of tricks, too. If you do BGs your best contribution isn't really support. In WSG you'd be the default flag carrier and in AB you'd be a good defender. Both necessary roles, but not as fun (to me) as being a front-line support. Nothing as satisfying as standing behind your allies keeping them alive when they make a push. 
---
As far as an alt, it does depend on what you're wanting. Are you just going to focus entirely on PvP? Or do you want something to do some end-game PvE? It might be good to pair a support class with a more straightforward one that does something different. A mage would be good. Just a pure DPS class with good farming potential. 
---
I agree, Conccussion Blow and Improved Revenge are great for 5mans. Improved Shield Bash is also very good if you’re fighting a lot of casters, really helps reposition if you can’t LoS. 
---
Why did I not think of this, that's cool!
---
Ignore his suggestion for flat stamina gear, mitigation is much more valuable. 
---
May Water give me clarity, Strength give me courage, Wind give me speed, and Flames give me temperance. The Shaman WILL receive the respect they deserve.
---
Yeah they're definitely not basing major development decisions on Nostalrius. They will announce a release date when they know for 100% certain how much development time is left to deliver a completed product. 
---
&gt;You kinda left off the part where he said I only have an hour to play today.... 
---
If that's the case then you don't have to do world quests that day. It's not like dailies which have a cap you would try to reach each day. The technical "cap" of world quests would require you to spend several hours on them each day, which I don't think anyone really does.
---
&gt;He logs in and probably has a bunch of chores to do to make sure he doesn’t fall to far behind and so misses out on doing the things he wants to do.
---
Yeah, all the weeklies are pretty much chores if you don't enjoy that content (m+ chest, pvp chest, island expeditions, warfronts). But the world quests really aren't bad, the only thing you should probably make sure you do with them if you have limited time is AP emissaries, and that takes maybe 15 minutes and you have three days to do it. If you want to "keep up" your AP level you need to do a few more, but there's no time gating in that, you can just do it whenever you want, kind of like grinding for gold in classic. 
---
Been playing Breath of the Wild to hold me over. It's easy to sink a lot of time into that game. I can't bring myself to spend money on anything new because I see myself getting lost in classic WoW for the entire summer. 
---
Sup with that thumb 
---
The explosion of prices on the Retail AH makes it very daunting for new players too.  Low-level items cost tens or hundreds of gold, which is completely infeasible for new players at low levels.  I'm looking forward to a more balanced economy being developed again in Classic.
---
Well to be fair, GoT is much darker than high fantasy is. And even if certain DnD campaigns don't have multiple race choices, WoW still has.
---
Holy is hard to kill. You might not be the most efficient, but you can kill stuff on your own. As long as you take Holy Nova you can do some AOE farming of lower zones. 
---
&gt; Fuckhalf the servers because the other half don't care right?
---
That's what you said.
---
Sharding, actually, was a good answer to server stability. Funnily enough, but I remember a time called 7.0-7.3.5 where sharding, outside of people phasing in and out and in and out, made the servers so stable that we even had the smoothest expac launch in ages, if not since the start of the game. World bosses, which had more than a single 40 man group killing them were also stable areas. What causes those lags with sharding has only really been around since BFA and not since sharding existed, which has been apparently around since WoD even. And the Legion invasions with the pre-patch back then were also alright.
---
What I am saying is that the lags aren't an inherent problem of sharding itself but a byproduct that was probably caused by something during BFA development. Spaghetti code is probably the best answer we can get until that problem is fixed, if ever.
---
The best one can do is wait. Wait until they properly announce whether they use sharding in starter areas or not. The problem with the classic community(which has huge parts of the toxic private server community baked in) is the fearmongering and cynicism, which are results from being burned by Blizzard and lack of actual information and relying on weird rumors or even wrong information. The proof that is the toxicity in the wowservers sub. Most of the posts have 0 upvotes and most replies are cynical remarks(usually upvoted), shills(depends for which server) or unpopular opinions(usually get downvoted).
---
Same here. Ten hours in and I decided it wasn't the Skyrim-rival that everyone made it out to be. Not that I thought it was a bad game, but I never understood how it was put on that level. 
---
Why stop at a small group when you can get an entire raid of engineers? 
---
https://youtu.be/4go53HvtEGQ
---
I played mostly Druid, Priest, and Mage in Vanilla. I'm intending to play Warrior in Classic though, mostly because I want to main the Tank role. Being Rogue-proof will just be a side perk. :D
---
I envy you, most of my friends got:  
---
A) Done with WoW couple years/expansions ago
---
B) The ones that endured had BFA murder what little attachment they had to the game and moved on to other things
---
They won't be irrelevant, but it gonna make them a little easier and faster to do. 
---
Example : Stage 1 you don't have ZG or DM who are "small catch up" dungeon/raid. Few World buff won't be available etc... While in the last stage everything will be "unlocked"
---
Like I said, the demo build was rushed through the door (they said as much themselves) and most of the problems with it were likely known issues already. The blue post is also .-~eViDeNcE~-. for my argument:
---
&gt;Another issue players reported was that Warlock demon summoning was broken – lots of players said that you shouldn’t lose your current demon until the new one appears. We double-checked and in the original 1.12 WoW, and there, as soon as you started summoning a new demon, your existing demon disappeared. So the demo actually matched how the game played originally. There were a few other reports – such as “rare mobs do way less damage” and “Kobolds at Jangolode Mine run faster than walking speed when running away” – where we were able to confirm that the gameplay was the same in the demo as in the original 1.12 WoW.
---
🤔H🤔m🤔m🤔m🤔
---
Because text is weird and it may not have gotten across, I hope its a smooth launch with no lag or bugs and the above comment was written in jest.
---
Yeah its ridiculous to think Blizz would risk somebody paying $15 per month just to hopefully get a few to pay an additional $15 one time. 
---
Yes. It is basically impossible to do this casually in vanilla.
---
So which number is true now and why?
---
The 10 DPS one multiplied by 4 people would result in 10 raw dps, which can be enhanced by crit and other % based mechanics of each player in a Shaman's group. So we might be talking about a 50/60 DPS increase which is significant.
---
But for me the Enhance tree isn't actually all that beneficial *at all* compared to a build like this:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxi0dVZVzezVLqo
---
This looks *much* more efficient and useful in my eyes for someone who wants to swing a weapon and play Shaman. One could increase DPS or healing with appropriate gear and by switching from a healing focussed to a totem twisting playstile and back.
---
OK then he has to sacrifice himself for all of us. Thank you WowJesus :-)
---
From what you're saying here, it looks like hunter might be your best bet. They're very independent, solid in both PvE and PvP, and can play the same spec for both. 
---
Spriest is fine for everything but raiding.
---
Aye, you do you brother.  I hope you get as much enjoyment out of Classic as you do Retail and the best part - both are included in your sub &lt;3
---
Thank you :)
---
I never did them honestly. Quests are the most boring part of the game so why would I torture myself daily ??? 
---
Not sure why you're downvoted, you're 100% correct. Guild Wars 2 is a game designed around horizontal content. The gear you get from the latest raid has the same stats as the top-level gear that launched with the game.
---
Do people even want that for WoW? I doubt it. But either way, WoW isn't designed that way. 
---
People reporting falsely does not take away from correct reports.  Try harder, troll.
---
&gt; I really hope I don't get into a server with a ton of private server players
---
The feral hype has its origin in the private server scene as far as I know. Every "known" feral player that showed how viable and strong the spec is plays on pservers and tested these things there.
---
Is truefaith the only thing that you need from tailoring that is bis? I would hate to give up a profession just to wish i had it to make more gear for later tiers.
---
Druid heals are definitely good end-game. There are some techniques (look up "power shifting") that get feral DPS to a respectable place - at least enough to raid a bit. In BGs they do run the flag and defend nodes well but you also have the unique option to be a stealthy healer. 
---
Nobody is going to keep an azure silk belt in their bags at all times.
---
If you look at a Pre-BiS list, just pick the items in the easier dungeons and shoot for those. And make sure you keep Shield Block up!
---
Noice.
---
Well an optimally played druid would be using pummelers so that's what you should compare an optimally played warrior too
---
&gt; I loved when in Cata you could do all your weekly chores (heroic dungeons) in one day. I hated it when they changed that so you have to log in every day to not miss out on something.
---
You need to log in every 3 days in BfA, and that is only for emissary quests, which most of the time aren't that useful anyway. Everything else is weekly.  
---
There were dailies in TBC?! The first time I remember any dailies was in MOP and it made me stop playing by then... I guessed I totally missed a huge chunk of the game lol
---
I do remember daily dungeon things in cata(?) but I don;t remember it being like necessary at all, I just remember i was doing that on my tank if the queue gave some bonus
---
A true Role Playing Role Playing game game*
---
Dailies were perfect as a source of gold. They didn't need to change from that, well if they had not made gold worthless that is. 
---
How about chuck you in a world and figure it out, oh here is 1 quest, have fun!
---
You dont sell SM runs, you sell lvl 60 dungeon runs and solo SM to sell the loot
---
How is the life as Shadow Priest?  
---
As far as i know they can melt faces in PvP, they have one Raidspot (as Long there are 16 Debuff Slots). But how are they in 5 mans? How are they at farming? Can you heal 5mans when you hit 60 with a shadow specc?   
---
And how is your life as a Moonkin? (Pls only opinions form people who actually played an Owl)  
---
I know they are bad, but can you make them work with enough effort?   
---
thx in Advance :)
---
Oh lol okay
---
I hate dailies but I kinda liked quel danas. The gradual unlocking was kinda cool and it was a pvp heaven.
---
Loktar Ogar 
---
Will be harder without quick heal.
---
Or weekly chest of disappointment
---
The helmets just make it so accurate and relatable 
---
1. Content is being released in stages, so don't worry about this idea of everything below AQ40 being abandoned by the time you show up.
---
2. MC will never stop being an actively run instance. I played during Vanilla's time and there were guilds still working on clearing MC, BWL, AQ40, and Naxx when TBC launched. People will be active at every stage and in fact the reason Blizz moved away from "Raid Tiers" as a design philosophy post-Vanilla was because almost none of the players ever actually raided AQ40 or Naxx, and from memory I reckon even maybe even BWL was never cleared by a majority of players.
---
You will have no trouble finding lower-tier raiding guilds, none at all.
---
I would imagine they'll remaster the old trailer with 4k res and maybe make it look a bit cleaner. But no new one.
---
I miss waiting for MC and BWL runs with my priest, using Mind Control to throw people into the lava from upstairs.
---
&gt;pvp heaven
---
I still have PTSD from mace rogue ganks on my warlock...
---
The whole netherwing thing? With the bombing runs? Generated about 50g a day? Plus heroic dungeon stuff
---
Quel'Danas was the shit honestly with all the PVP going on, I remember farming the 10k there to buy the 280% mount speed.
---
You absolutely can raid with Arms spec. It may not be optimal but you're not going to be terrible
---
More like autoattacks everyone.
---
Where are blue 2h weapons 12g at a vendor?
---
Yes I hate dailies. Dailies (and my guild dieing due to a ninja looter) made me quit WoW towards the end of TBC.
---
Dailies are for people that want to be told what to do. That's not why I like sandbox MMOs
---
Helmets check out, yup.
---
RIP
---
Hi, /u/Silent_E
---
- Professions (particularly gathering ones eg mining, herbalism, skinning) are always profitable and can be done as a tank spec. Even low-level items remain highly valuable (for example the herb swiftthistle was always valuable and it dropped from herbs in level ~20-30 zones).
---
- Many tanks and healers eventually make alts for PvP, and these DPS-specced alts also turn into capable farming alts.
---
- Selling instance runs or boosting friends' alts throughdungeons dungeons on condition you get anything they don't need.
---
Because it hyperinflates the pockets of nolifers and leaves casuals even further in the dust economically in a fashion that has no pvp risk and no pve competition?
---
Don’t underestimate fishing!
---
I'll second u/bobhoebehop suggestion about the mage. They're pretty self-sufficient and the leveling process is pretty quick. Tailor/enchant or tailor/skinning would be good professions for them. Skinning probably more than enchanting as the secondary because you'll be alone and it's easier to get money that way. 
---
You might also consider a warlock. They aren't as strong as a mage, but they're a pet class so they level well solo. They also have some fun spec options and they aren't always straightforward to play. Same profession suggestions. 
---
Back in TBC and WotLK I used to do dailies ALL the time. I think the most intense is when I'd do everything at the trial of the crusader and then a bunch more until I hit the 20(25?) cap day after day. I guess it didn't bother me that much because I loved the game but I can't say I actually enjoyed myself 100% of the time. I recently tried BfA and got to the level cap and then all the world quests opened up and I just sat there and wondered "why? what's the point?". So I can unlock a new race and do all this content I didn't even necessarily enjoy again for...no reason? When the game is so utterly abhorrent to play as is? And the mission tables are just eugh. I stopped playing because of it. Classic can't come soon enough.
---
Funny comparison because I actually was one of the few people who also did not get into Skyrim. After playing Oblivion, I was really disappointed with skyrim.
---
Man I loved Oblivion, playing it again right now 
---
In Classic pretty much every raid stays relevant. That‘s because of different factors: 1. Gear is hard to come by with raids the only viable source. It will take a long time to equip 40 raiders and every guild has to deal with leavers/ quitters/... so you constantly have to equip new members again. 2. Every raid in vanilla has valuable items that people will use/need pretty much throughout vanilla, e.g. Thunderfury Bindings from MC, Onslaught Girdle for Warriors from rag and so on. Some classes will switch those MC, BWL and ZG items very late in Naxxramas as the gear gets better there but then again this will take a lot of time in Classic. 3. Even if a Guild gets to the point, that all raid members are fully equiped with the best gear during the given content phase (which probably won‘t every happen), people will start to run raids for alts. So the whole cycle begins again.
---
I think it's more "how well did pservers actually emulate this".
---
Bear tank can be done in all raids with the right group
---
That was the first and last time I ever did dailies
---
Yeah TBC was the first introduction of dailies. There were the Netherwing, Ogri'la and Sha'tari Skyguard ones first and the Shattered Sun Offensive was added with the Sunwell patch
---
Both being included is the best part &lt;3 free extra game yo, and a magical one at that!
---
I found a private server with instant 60 and 5 man raids. I went ahead and created one of every class and I'm trying them all out. Definitely a good way to decide which class I want to play at end game. 
---
Although, leveling is another story... 
---
But what exactly? The sell values of items were pretty easy to check, so I don't know what could possibly be incorrect?
---
I remember landing on stacks of skeletons and trying to run into town ASAP, praying to be safe. Then just dying in 1 second while the people ran away. CANT. WAIT. 
---
That was the case previously. But since the average skill level has gone up obscene amounts i think these specs will be more playable as the other members are much better.
---
Shaman, cant wait to give this one a listen!!!! so ready to play my Shammy in Classic. Give me a release!!!!!!!!!
---
There's no good use of skinner box. There are other, less intrusive ways to gate progress or boost casual play without using opportunity loss rewards, or make you feel handicapped if you're not following the game's arbitrary checklist tasks.
---
Rested XP is a great mechanic, it accumulates and you can use it when/how you want, the same thing should be applied to any kind of bonus or repetitive tasks the game wants you to do.
---
Even if the daily bonuses accumulated up to say 10-15 worth it would be a good start.
---
THIS! ^
---
He was just making fun of your "RPG game" or "Role-Playing Game game" :P
---
Hope you never annoy a bunch of salty nerds. Cause you're never going to talk in a public setting again. 
---
There are a great many variables such as mob stats, player stats, and drop tables that can factor into whether pserver strategies (for everything, not just dungeon farming) will be as viable or lucrative in Classic.
---
So when classic comes out, I plan on playing with my wife, and what class I choose also depends on what class she chooses. Currently she’s deciding between either a hunter or a healer of some kind. If she doesn’t go healer, I will play a priest, as I enjoyed being a healer back in the day but never played a priest. If she does go healer, I’m trying to decide on what I would want to play. We won’t have all that much time to play during the summer and fall, but should have more time come winter. In fact I wouldn’t be surprised if we don’t reach 60 until some time in the new year. We likely won’t be doing any serious raiding, but I would like to step foot in MC/Onyxia’s lair again if the opportunity presents itself. We will be rolling alliance.
---
Paladin/Rogue/Warlock: These are the three classes I’ve played before and as fun as they were (I especially enjoyed warlock), I have no urge to play them again. Been there done that.
---
Warrior: I’ve never played a tank and thought this might be an interesting class to play. However, we won’t have much time to play, and my understanding is that this class is very gear dependent, moreso than any other. My worry is that this will mean I’ll always be subpar when it comes to pvp. While raiding is far from a priority, I am not sure how likely a casual or PUG raid group would want to take me either. I’ve also heard leveling a warrior is a pain in the ass, but I assume having a healer leveling with you would make it easier.
---
Druid: This is another class that intrigues me as they sound very versatile, although my wife will already have the healer portion covered. But from what I’ve read about vanilla druids, they sound like a jack of all trades, master of none. It sounds like they aren’t great in pvp except for running flags in WSG. If we do 5 mans, I could probably tank but I wouldn’t be as desired as a warrior. If I do end up raiding I’m perfectly ok with just being a healer.
---
Priest: I’m thinking about rolling a priest anyway. My understanding is that shadow priests can be rather deadly in pvp, though I’m unsure how they perform in a 5 man dungeon. Plus if we do end up raiding I can easily switch to a healing spec once I reach end game.
---
Mage: This is the only pure DPS class I have any interest in playing. I’ve always liked mages, at least from the outside looking in. They seem cool. But I’m not sure if I really want to play a DPS class.
---
Dailies were incredibly prevalent in tbc.  There were the skettis dailies, bem apexis ones, netherwing drake ones, and then the isle of dailies(aka quel'danas). It was the easiest way to earn gold without farming mats. They were initially limited to 10 a day and by the end of TBC was increased to 25/day since the isle had so many. They gave like 10g per, so to save for epic flying people grinded them like mad.
---
Congrats on being an incel. 
---
I agree about dailies, I noticed it towards the end of my days in TBC too - I enjoyed the Shattrath ones but after Quel'danas came out it made it more obvious.
---
But it sure was taken to a whole other level with garrisons in WoD. What a terrible expansion to come back to retail to. This time I had a full time job with a very long drive and I found myself having to *literally* farm herbs from my Garrison, click on the stupid reinforcements crate, check followers, check crafters, do my missions, etc. Every time I logged in, before I could get to doing something new and interesting for the day, I had this routine like I'm some recovering addict in rehab and they put me through some busy work do I don't feel how monotonous the world is around me.
---
Impressive the way you tried to be overly literal in his definition, then the part where I bolded key words that you ignored didn't get a response from you. This is why you lost, you are now talking past every single important argument and even taking seriously the comments I openly stated were trolls. I do not care about abhominems because I think I was providing arguments in my posts, you're just ignoring all of your principles you talked about before. 
---
We went over this dude, he can get a weapon chain onto his weapon without being a blacksmith. But if he wants to use keys and bloodvine set bonus, he has to carry with him constantly those professions. Wait, you are trying to say you're sorry for making this about semantics? "you used webster ;(" well yeah we are speaking english and YOU said semantics matter in a videogame like this, what a hypocrite.
---
Dailies basically drove me to quit playing, I'm not logging in every fucking day to do chores
---
Not to mention deep in the feral tree you unlock a 3% physical damage crit chance aura 
---
This
---
that's how you get hemorrhoids
---
Its not when the ping is actually closer to 300 and you are getting constant "spell is not ready" error messages when you are clearly off Global Cooldown, or trying to not be kited by a hunter / mage when on your screen your are humping their leg.
---
That's some quality shitpost.
---
I used Fade a LOT as a priest healer in dungeons in Vanilla.
---
NO BRAIN AND NO HEART
---
Yeah, there might be some differences which might make some things more or less efficient, but I don't think it will be more than 10%-20%.
---
I mean I remember the dungeons from retail vanilla and also played on private servers and I don't feel there were huge differences.
---
Roll a shaman then go level in the ud zones.
---
Nostalgia plays its part, that's for sure. For me personally, the summers of '05 and '06 were the prime of my youth, i was playing WoW like a maniac but also having a great time irl.
---
It's just a period of my life that i remember very very fondly and i'm glad that i was able to be a part of this era, it felt like belonging. Being part of something that was unique and special. Humans are wired like that, we love this kind of shit.
---
That being said, this is not the sole reason why i love Vanilla. I've been playing on Private Servers for years now and i'm still not burnt out. Why? Because Classic is just a superb game. Yes, it has its lacking QoL Features, yes, it's not the most modern engine...I know all that but i simply don't give a fuck. Those are all minor inconveniences for me personally. 
---
I actually PREFER to actively look for groups and chat with people in order to get things going. That's the core of MMO design for me. I don't wanna be isolated in front of my computer and feel like my character is some amazing world-saving ultra hero. I love the fact that you get to know people on your server, that all the other players aren't just some random guys you'll never meet again. I've developed friendships on every single classic server i have ever played on. Even with players of the opposing faction because hey, you saw that guy while leveling and over the course of an entire year in some BGs, out in the wild or in front of raid entrances. Cool stuff happens.
---
That's the entire point of classic, it really captured the essence of what is important to me in an MMORPG. Collaboration, hard work, a large and mysterious world and this overwhelming sense of community. 
---
All those convencient QoL changes actually ruined WoW for me. Why else would i have quit before MoP was released!?
---
The "Game" itself became better and better but it lost core elements of what made it so incredible to me.
---
Madseason, frost, classicwinds best classic youtubers. Tips needs a new job.
---
Thank you! I’ll try and keep the feed shitty
---
I love Brandon Sanderson and the Way of Kings!! You have good taste in books!!
---
Ah yes, I enjoyed fishing. Jamming to some music and/or watching tv while clicking, kind of relaxing sometimes. It will be even easier now that I have a much nicer pc.
---
Loads of raids will take him. YOU might not, cause you're a creepy gatekeeper that cant handle something being anything under 100% optimal. 
---
Spoiler: People are going to raid without full preraid BIS. Retribution paladins will raid, chickens will raid, cats will raid. And they'll do it without world buffs and 400 consumables.
---
And just like the private server paladong with his thunderfury tanking, they will piss off all the private server mongos who hate their lives to do 5% more damage.
---
Stop. Being. A. Gatekeeper.
---
It honestly took like..... an hour or two before i started to notice people chatting a lot, and when i got to level 12 id regularly see people grouping in chat for deadmines. Flah forward to level 18 and i made a few groups, one which did the undead miner quests outside of the instance (no one does those in retail, not in 10 years). 
---
Private servers are a simple way to see how the game was (at least, the one i played on).
---
Certainly open to it. But don't want to be forced into it. I healed a ton from WotLK to BfA since I played hybrid classes mainly. 
---
I enjoyed Wrath dailies and BC dailies...mostly due to how they were varied and it has good rewards. Everything after that it felt mostly pointless. 
---
Classic is going to be 1.12. Not 1.2.
---
&gt;The Priest Idea I thought about but the class is pretty straight forward.
---
Just roll a Human Priest and be done with it. Priests are probably the most complete healing class and have some great abilities in their toolbox.
---
 Make a Shaman alt on the Horde side if you want to keep in touch with the Shaman class.
---
I used it in 5 mans when things went bad and the tank had no control of a pack of mobs and I didn't want any more damn aggro.
---
I have not read the third book yet either. Been a struggle to find time to read, but I love the Stormlight archives. 
---
Sanderson finished up the wheel of time series for Robert Jordan and he did such an excellent job at continuing the same narrative. I feel like that takes a special set of skills. 
---
Literally first item on the list.
---
For a public test the ratio of false reports to actual legitimate bugs would be like 50:1, or worse if they do the public test after proper private testing. It's simply not the kind of project where public testing is useful or needed.
---
THE LIGHT WILL PREVAIL! 
---
1.2? You mean **26 DAYS** after the game launched? How many 60s do you think there were then? How many of those 60s do you think were comparing their damage online and not just struggling to pull together groups? Hell, 1.3 was only 4 months after launch.
---
9 hours isn’t even enough time to get out of the introductory zone lmao. Once you get into Velen is when the game really picks up.
---
As far as i know classic will be running on 1.12.1 as a baseline but with certain items and content being gated so the game follows a more authentic progression but using the talents of 1.12.1.   
---

---
I suggest dont. Just go to work and play in your free time.
---
You know, dalies werent even *that* bad compared to the shit we have now (World Quests/Emissaries).
---
Dalies you were normally at least done with once you hit exalted.  Now with the constant treadmill of azerite, chances for upgrades (for those of us that dont raid at a higher level), rep for paragon caches (why the fuck do i still go for those things at all), gear on alts, etc....i mean, i dont *have* to do them, but it feels like a waste not to sometimes.
---
You need good gear to do well in PvP as a Shadow Priest. And getting good gear is going to be the hard part. The other caster DPS's will have priority over gear so it will take a very long time to gear up through raiding. 
---
In raids you're pretty much just a buffbot for the Warlocks and not a very good one at that. Dungeon's are the same way except you're not able to buff the damage for as many Warlocks so you're even more useless. The biggest problem Shadow Priest have in PvE is mana efficiency. They run out of mana very quickly.
---
You should be able to heal most 5-man dungeons as Shadow but you'll need two sets of gear and it will take longer. 
---
If you really want to go Shadow you're probably better off just PvPing to Rank 10 for the blue set and calling it a day. The Rank 10 gear is actually pretty good for Shadow Priest's. That set plus the epic items from getting to Exalted with the PvP factions will make a decent set. That's my current plan for Classic as a  Ret Paladin since they are pretty bad in PvE as well.
---
You can farm Dire Maul lashers with holy nova, you just need enough intellect to be able to cast it like 8-9 times in a row. The problem is that DM will not be released at launch and in this case I would recommend getting a gathering profession like herbalism or mining. 
---
Another method would be to do strat live round robin runs, but that requires a group. 
---
They SELL to the vendor for that. Weapons always vendor fairly well gold wise.
---
So he does a World Record, comes back 13 years later and breaks it on his first try by 22 hours?
---
I think that says more about the quality of pserver emulation than about his route.
---
Hello! I have been agonizing over which class to play.   
---
A little about me: I enjoy more complex classes. My main interest is PvP, but I am open to PvE too.  I am NOT interested in playing warrior, mainly because I don't want to be largely dependent on other people to PvP or PvE. I am NOT interested in paladin, priest, or mage either. In retail WoW I was mainly a healer and played high rated arenas, however, I am not sure how fun healing is in classic wow (both PvP or PvE).  I want whichever class I choose to be capable of making a significant contribution in either BGs or raid environments, while also being adept in handling open world PvP.   
---
I apologize for the vagueness - Just give me all of your thoughts, I would love to read how knowledgeable you are about the classes and how they are played!
---
But with WoW the better stuff is sooooo simple and overwhelming. I think what WoW looks like lately is kinda cool but none of it matters because no one talks in the game anymore. Retail WoW is a fundamentally different experience, period.
---
So even if there are a bunch of warts and pimples on the face of classic its still the face i like. Its still social. 
---
Retail WoW is like a beautiful face but with no hair whatsoever (not even eyelashes).
---
I don't want to get into an argument if changing anything about this would be good or bad, but changing this would definitely be regarded as changing core features of vanilla and it doesn't seem like the team working on Classic want to do that.
---
Wrath definitely had plenty of them as well, especially once the Argent Tournament opened up.  I know there were other ones, but im completely spacing on them now (i think there were some pvp-ish ones in Grizzly Hills, but im thinking of something else...other than just the daily heroic).
---
Im almost certain there were some in Cata as well, though i dont remember when they popped up.  I know there were the Hyjal (firelands) ones, but i think they werent out right away and came later on.
---
/slowly  puts shotgun away 
---
I feel like this has less finesse than the distract
---
That's not what the OP says, but okay.
---
Horde or alliance?
---
Rich rogues use thorium grenades :p
---
dwarf priest
---
You also need to be an experienced player who knows what he's doing. 
---
99% of people starting to play ret or elemental shaman or enhancer will regret it due to the absolute shitload of consumables one has to farm to become remotely seen in the raids DPS chart.
---
I for one am too casual for that. I raid BWL and such with my warrior, I will slack once in a while if I dont feel grinding every little consumable that week. 
---
No such thing for elemental shaman. Grind demonic runes for mana or your damage will be nada. No mana = no damage. I couldn't bring myself to grinding 20hours a week just to be 70% of a mages damage who just strokes himself while grinding half an hour for his basic needs.
---
You'll be fine with a combination of options like herbing, mining, live strat (with first other reserved before round robin), fishing, or a DM Hunter even.
---
Mage is probably the better compromise between the two overall, though SM/Ruin is a better spec for organized pvp than the SL spec that's best for solo in open world. So there is leeway depending what you want to do. I prefer Warlocks but that's entirely a personal preference. I highly doubt you would regret a mage, they can be monotonous in PvE (so can locks) but they're awesome in PvP.
---
I mean, to be fair...Its going to be what...a year before flying comes out?  You only need to average slightly less than 2 WQs per week (yeah, i know repeats are a thing, but theres a lot up at once) for the flying meta.
---
If anything youre going to do more than that getting the rep required, probably.
---
Probably the dumbest shit I've read in April, good work
---
Provide evidence for your claims

Robe of Power, lvl 33 BoP tailor chest. Requires 190 skill.

This is why I don't agree with people who want more content for vanilla 'as long as it follows the philosophy'. Vanilla was *not* the product of some practiced, dogmatic design philosophy; it was a specific set of dudes at a specific point in time with specific tech limitations doing their best to make the best game they could.         
---
        
---
Even if you retroactively took the game design choices they made, amalgamated them together, called it a 'philosophy' and then tried to design new content using it, it *still* wouldn't jive with the original content because that's now how that original content's creation was directed. 
---
I think you should talk with your neighbor about sharing the service (get the cable physically from his/her router into your house) in exchange chip in every month into the cost and maybe offer to upgrade to whatever is the highest package available so you can both do stuff without restricting the other.
---
Netherwing and Ogri'la
---
100% agree. Dailies are such terrible game design. Well, actually they're genius at hooking people with addictive personalities, that's why mobile games all follow that format. But they're terrible in terms of fulfilling, rewarding game design.

Hi, /u/OverKast78
---
It looks like https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346 is saying it's 1.2?
---
Is your neighbours ISP that DSL company that kept cancelling on you?  If so, they certainly should be able to continue running the line down the road and up to your house.  My friend lives in bum fuck Maine and Timer Warner did that exact thing when he signed up for their service.
---
i used to love dailys, from bc to mop, i loved all of them, but since wod, i hate them and its 1 of the reasons why i dont play them anymore, wq are not dailys for me, its a stupid system
---
When will you people learn that no changes mean no changes? That means no Scarab lord title, that means no Bloodlust, that means flying mounts and it certainly means no stupid dog quest in Mulgore. You can’t pick and choose 
---
Beyond that... you may be stuck with DirecTV's internet.
---
blue post says 
---
&gt;We’ll launch Classic with content from original WoW through patch 1.2.x
---
Am I mistaken?
---
Dailies were the absolute death of the World. It made it into an RPG where you could do whatever you wanted in this massive, sprawling world into this very much online game where you were led like cattle.
---
You won't be rogueproof ! Just bad rogues proof.  
---
[https://youtu.be/WtMsTlNowQ0](https://youtu.be/WtMsTlNowQ0) (Perplexity vs Monkeynews)
---
They don't tag for the reason you just stated. You can't tag a mob and not be eligible for loot. 
---
This is called a PVE server. Strangely way less rogues than on PVP servers, I wonder why ! :D
---
hardcore are classes that benefit from advanced things like totem twisting and autoshot weaving for hunters
---
im sure every class has something like this but alot of them sound very tedious
---
If she goes priest, I would suggest fighting off the temptation to roll one. You'll be rolling against each other for gear (especially the tier 0.5 dungeon set) and that's just ... not fun. 
---
Druids are fun, but you're right that they don't completely excel in any one regard. They can do some decent damage as feral DPS, especially in dungeons. I wouldn't worry about a warrior being preferred as a tank because 1) that doesn't matter in dungeons and 2) you'll be rolling with your own priest. LFG as a tank / heal combo will be lightning fast. 
---
I'm no expert in warriors, but you're right both that they're gear dependent and that the leveling process will be much easier than other warriors because you're duo-leveling with a healer. That said, there's a meta about a DPS warrior spec tanking (fury, I think) that you might want to look into as it could fill your needs to be capable in PvP, farming, and tanking. Just like the feral druid, you have the nice benefit of looking for group as a healer / tank.
---
Mages are mages. They're great for DPS and for farming. You'll have some overlap in rolling for gear against a priest, but not too much at level 60. 
---
Another thing to consider is that your pacing will be pretty slow so you'll likely be hitting 60 after the tier 0.5 dungeon sets are released. That's a pretty easy grind because you and your wife will need the same dungeons again and again to get the drops. Once you have a good fraction of that set, you'll be set for Ony and MC regardless of the class you roll.
---
My suggestion is to go warrior to her priest. No overlap in gear needs and no overlap in role in raids when you get to that point. If she goes tailor / &lt;something&gt; and you go mining / smithing you can be pretty self-sufficient with gear throughout the leveling process.  
---
They mean *content* from, not the actual spell/talent/etc data. They're talking about dungeon, raid, and gear that will be available.
---
&gt; As far as i know they can melt faces in PvP
---
They are god tier in solo PvP and PUG/random groups BG. Their strength is dimished in premade vs. premade but still good.
---
&gt; they have one Raidspot (as Long there are 16 Debuff Slots)
---
Probably one of the most boring things you can do is raiding as a Shadow Priest. But yes, we'll have 16 slots.
---
&gt; But how are they in 5 mans? (...) Can you heal 5mans when you hit 60 with a shadow specc?
---
Yes, you can heal 5 mans just fine. You will just sit down more to drink than a heal specced healer. For some encounters you probably have to drink a manapot or two.
---
&gt; And how is your life as a Moonkin? (Pls only opinions form people who actually played an Owl)
---
I know they are bad, but can you make them work with enough effort?
---
Yes you can "make them work", whatever that means. We have a Moonkin in our guild and he's doing ok. Their damage/dps is very high for a while, but they don't have the sustain of a mage/warlock obviously. They can also heal 5mans just fine like Shadow Priests. He is mostly wearing cloth items.
---
Just consider this: Both Moonkin and Shadowpriest basically limit their respective classes to a very straight forward playstile. I mean most of the time, raid dps is kind of boring with *any* dps class compared to tanking or healing, but pure DPS classes just have more tools and ways of dealing damage.
---
I didn’t actually up or downvote anyone here. If you know that it works like that you should also know that it will become problematic. Don’t you agree that lag and disconnects are bad? Don’t you think they should work on preventing this issue? And how can they test if they fixed that possible issue? A stress test?
---
That's probably the best situation that could happen out of wow aside from those that met their SOs
---
For that particular fight they are better tanks than Warriors.
---
you can't log on and grind dailies for however long you want, you can only do them once each and then you're artificially gated from doing them until tomorrow
---
I'm 99% sold on Priest. Someone reassure me that Preach is talking shit and that Priest healing in raids isn't incredibly boring.
---
This is an interesting idea, but I have concerns that it would severely throttle my neighbor's performance. I believe the highest option available is a laughable 12Mbps down/1Mbps up and it's more likely that they are on 6Mbps down/400kbps up. The houses are spread out so it may not be feasible to try that. My understanding is that the issues the company has with their infrastructure stem from doing this sort of thing anyway. Sort of daisy chaining all their customer's lines together.
---
Do you have any source on that? I can't find any blue post or blizzard blog that says they'll be sourcing the spell data differently than the 1.2 patch they plan on running off of.
---
Nah, just go mining-engineering and then get an alt to 35 and give him alch. You'll have ore to sell from farming, plus the arcanite transmute.
---
Which hunter spec would be best for pve and PvP? And what race goes best with it? 
---
I made the vast majority of my money as a tribal leatherworker, especially when resist gear was added to the tables. Don’t worry about money worry about playing the class you think is the most fun.
---
I for one am just happy to see a disagreement / misunderstanding on reddit resolved peacefully, kudos to both of you. 
---
&gt; Do they get their asses handed back to them in pvp?  
---
 Not at all. Watch Luptis for some inspiration.

Runescape is undergoing a similar renaissance of people going back to the older version.
---
It's true but you should also talk about the negatives of choosing such spec. If I'm a party leader for any type of content and I know my group needs a heavy hitter I'm going to look for the best class with the best spec for the job to maximize our odds of succeeding. Simply put, you won't be the first choice. Maybe not even second choice depending on what you're playing.
---
This was me.  A pve only elemental shaman on a PvP server grinding the isle of Quel dailies.  Life was suffering. 
---
i will play human but want to have ne mount. i read therefor i have to be exalted with darnassus. what is the best way to get exalted with darnassus as human? is there a reasonable way to do it til lvl 40 for slow mount? or does it make more sense to wait till lvl 60?
---
?
---
Druids are much better for MC during progression. They have superior mitigation over warriors at that point, as well as superior threat. Warrior tanks dont really start catching up until they have a good amount of raid epics.
---
Warriors will be ahead of Druid tanks during BWL progression due to lack of upgrades for the Druid. Once your guild get to AQ40 however, Druids will get a massive threat and mitigation boost from the gear dropping in AQ and will be pretty equal to Warriors again.
---
&gt;...except current raidtier
---
This is false.
---
If you have played the game from the last "reset" (patch 8.1, this winter), you only have a very limited amount of stuff you "need" to do. 
---
The only things most people who have played the expansion for a while does is: 
---
m+ chest (weekly)
---
emissaries (three days)
---
islands (weekly)
---
extra world quests (if they have extra time)
---
mission table (takes like 10 seconds)
---
And even then, after a certain point (when you neck lvl is high enough), the only thing you "need" to do each week is the m+ chest. 
---
Invasions is for completionists (getting mounts etc.). Heroics is for people who are learning how to play. Warfronts are a waste of time. LFR is for people who can't raid. 
---
Sorry about the arguing. But I don't like people spreading misinformation, doesn't matter if it's intentional or not (it obviously isn't in your case). 
---
Only BoP thing, at least. Unless you're planning on being Shadow at 60
---
It is the same company. I've talked to them and from the little bits of info I get from each representative, I've pieced together the conclusion that the box is full and they have no plans to add any more ports since my addition would not offset the cost of installing a new box. I can understand that, from their perspective, but I was promised service from them several times before being told it was not possible. I feel that they should honor that promise. But I guess that is not the way the world works.
---
This is called fear of missing out. It is a blatant psychological manipulation that they have gotten all too good at in recent years. 
---
cite your sources, as under the context you present your arguments in, it makes them seem irreputable. we can resume the discussion once you cite said reputable sources. not to discredit the argument you presented, but you are making some dubious claims and not backing them up with substantial citations, in this light, your argument is missing a merit.

Read life at 60 for a druid, it will either strengthen your resolve to play a druid or you will run away like hell :

Nost has no factor in when they release any of their content. Sure, Nost was a huge factor in making classic happen, but blizzard doesn't give a shit about Nost. They got them shut down... They aren't going to praise them by releasing something on something that would honor them. If it happens on the 10th it is NOT because of Nost. 
---
&gt;The really good AQ gear is the helmet in AQ40 and the boots in AQ20. Otherwise a lot of the really significant gear you’ll have before then.
---
Guise, Thick Qirajihide Belt, Gloves of the Hidden Temple, Qiraji Execution Bracers, Mantle of Wicked Revenge (if not AB exalted), Blessed Qiraji Warhammer, Mark of C'Thun,  [R](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=21601)ing of Emperor Vek'lor, etc etc.
---
Druids get massive upgrades through AQ. Its by far the best raid for them gearwise, and it makes them perfectly capable of tanking any content except a select few bosses for the remainder of the game.

yes

I'm a huge Warlock fan. I won't say they're better than mages, because mages are great and do some things better. But they are very chill leveling with very little down time.
---
They are not as good dps in dungeons usually (but by no meand shabby), and your CC is less often needed (Banish is great but less needed than Poly, and you almost never Fear in dungeons). But summons and soulstones are always very welcome! If you really want a particular instance, being Warlock near the entrance gets you high priority.
---
You can do a lot of neat stuff in the world with Fear, Enslave (works on elites!), and self heals. Instead of the mage aoe grind strategy, I would challenge myself by seeing how many mobs I could dot up and kill without needing to stop between pulls. Once I got Siphon Life, I could take three even level mobs at once and just keep pulling like that clearing entire camps as fast as they spawned.
---
Oh, pets and free mount are cool too! But you really can't go wrong with either mage or lock for trying out cloth dps. Locks level faster but mages end up being better at farming later on. Both have lots of neat tricks, absolutely try one or both out.
---
LOL
---
This guy dont have a clue
---
Are people excited for the honor system...? I feel like it's one of those deeply flawed things we accept because #nochanges. It's pretty much an objectively terrible design that rewards extreme time commitment over skill. 
---
The difference with dailies is they're essentially required to advance in the modern game, they are THE core content. Meanwhile most people ignore the PvP rank system or only worry about the first few ranks. If you get gear elsewhere, you don't need the PvP gear and it's only for titles. Far from necessary. Same with any of the real long rep grinds.
---
sons of hodir maybe
---
You think you can level an alt to 60 in 1d15h with a helper?
---
I think you are in for a rude awakening....
---
He's talking about having to grind rep in obsolete content like WoD just to get flying there.  I can agree with making you do it while content is current, but having to grind out rep on an expansion you missed is on obnoxious. 
---
I am really looking forward to working towards a certain goal, achieving said goal (and loot), and then MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ONE. 
---
You raid once a week, even if you need 4 hours that's not that much time and you top dps meters as a druid. Other classes need days to farm their pre raid bis gear and still need luck on the rolls. I don't see much difference. And even without them you do good dps like the mages and warlocks that can't off tank or combat rez. Lots of value. At least how I see it, being one of the few feral druids with top dps you will be insane in pvp as well and good progression guilds will take at least one for sure. Everyone will roll warriors and rogue or mages taking forever to complete their sets while druids look pretty. Play what you like of course, but druids are beast, underrated and much sought after. 
---
Probably, but he kept working on optimizing his route after the record, he just never did a run again. When he was doing the sppedruns he was also going for server firsts so it was very taxing on his body. He aknowledged that the PS values were probably off, but also said that he thought the route he ran now would've worked in classic (as in, quests didn't give more exp so he got to skip some grinding). 
---
But who knows, he wants to go for the record in classic as well so I guess we'll see then. 
---
Yes, and that is only possible on private servers where you can force a crit through sitting to keep up enrage. If the Warrior tank is not sitting, the Druid tank will be slightly ahead on damage.
---
Oh, and lets not forget the DW fury tank take aproximately 30% more damage than the Bear tank while dualwielding.
---
Is there a possibility that new houses or new customers (other than you) will pop up on your street?  That'd certainly offset the cost.  I'd suggest trying to contact their corporate office.
---
I hated doing dailies but during TBC, I got my full S3 armor/weap and just laid waste to people trying to do them in Nagrand. That was a lot of fun.
---
Im essentially playing blood DK as a 2H fury warrior. Alchemy for infinite healing pots. Lifestealing enchant. Maybe a Lifestone. Obviously a forsaken. 
---
12?
---
You need to keep in mind that Warriors cannot abuse /sit to generate enrage stacks in Classic. The result of this is that Druids will be on par with Warriors for threat even without Pummelers, and miles ahead if they use them.
---
Ummm no 🙄🙄
---
WE NEED TO PUT OUR VACATION DAYS IN. PLZ BLIZZ 
---
One guy got banned on a pserver for whatever and he got his mates together (he was guild lead) and one or two of them leveled him up in under two days /played.
---
Might've been 1d10hours or 1d25hours, so I just averaged it:

luckyyyyyyyyy..... :(
---
I think you will have no problems creating gold at 60 even in prot spec.
---
Keeping at least one gathering profession, along with fishing can make you a ton of gold already. Playing the AH and selling your tanking services will have you swimming in gold in no time. 
---
Hm. So no warrior, paladin, priest, or mage. That leaves rogue, hunter, warlock, shaman and druid. I know nothing about rogues and little about warlocks. Hunters are fun but pretty straightfoward. 
---
Druids and shaman are both complex classes, but both will likely be a healer if you decide to raid. I loved healing in vanilla; it was nothing like the snoozefest of healing in retail now. If you're doing BGs as a druid your best contribution will be to run the flag in WSG or to stealth camp a node in AB. That's not because you can't do anything else, but because druids are best at those two things. 
---
Shaman actually sounds like a class you'd like. They are usually healers in raids (and not incredibly exciting ones at that), but an elemental / resto shaman tears up PvP and dungeons. I say ele/resto instead of enhancement because that also gives the option to do some healing on top of your massive chain lightning crits. You have the support options of the many, many totems and some other utility (self-rez in particular). 
---
Leveling as a shaman is not the easiest, but the class itself is fun.
---
Crushed for 2000 damage on a 13000 Health pool. Yeah huge issue.
---
I liked cooking dailies. But dailies everywhere.. nah.
---
Thank you so much! I was certain I remembered this happening but when I recently searched for 'awesome events that happened in WoW' I could only find references to Kazzak being kited to IF so I guessed it was just that.
---
&gt; Some of my most poignant memories of Vanilla are being denied from  groups. I wanted nothing more than a Mace of Unending Life. I got my  Cenarion Circle reputation up to exalted just from grinding mobs in  Silithus and just needed the raid drops to finish it. I recall spending  weekends loitering in Ironforge looking for groups forming and sitting  on that rock outside AQ20 whispering people zoning in if they needed an  off-tank or secondary DPS. I never got that mace. I never even killed  the final boss. I'm still bitter about it.   
---
&gt; Make no mistake, druids are really fun. The speed and versatility is great. But if you have the misfortune of enjoying the *wrong*  spec then you're playing everything beyond UBRS on hard mode, and will  have to overcome the prejudice of players who'd rather have a warrior or  mage. 
---

---
When dailies came out in TBC, their core concept was good: optional questing that you could do if in need of some extra gold/rewards. I clearly remember a dev announcing dailies as the end of gold farmers (lol).
---
They since evolved into just a mechanism to drive daily participation and increase some metric, somewhere.
---
Original dailies were a cool concept.
---
Isnt that a bit like saying its unfair that you have to run MC/AQ before you can do Naxx?
---
Others did the work when the content came out.  You can choose to do that work as well if you want the same things as them.  Even if you dont want to do the work you can still level through the zones, just a bit slower than people that put in the time to do it.
---
FWIW, i didnt play for much of WoD and still managed to get it fairly easily.  
---
I'm still undecided but it gives me something to think about and get excited for.  Priest/hunter/mage top 3 with pvp being my main go to 
---
Yeah I think dailies broke my WoW addiction to be honest. It just became such an obvious, pathetic approximation of an actual job. 
---
There’s no need to go prot for any content in vanilla, at any stage in the game. I’m sure most guilds will require it for some reason, but unless you’re in that position, just stay fury.
---
If that’s not an option; go herb/arch or herb/mining and spend your time gather and/or crafting potions 
---
Just make a frost mage alt?
---
I think anyone who isn't planning on levelling at least 2-3 alts to 60 are severely handicapping themselves for no good reason. 
---
Being able to farm mats/gold/rep yourself is very important, being dependant on the AH at 60 is a good way to never get your epic mount.
---
Icecrown had some random ones all over the place (PvP, jumping to the top of the mountain, etc) Storm Peaks had the Sons of Hodir, Sholazar had the two opposing factions, there were profession dailies in Dalaran, and some other random smattering of dailies like Wyrmrest.  Wrath was loaded with them from day one.

“Hey everyone, in tribute to this undocumented server that we shut down (in addition to the others we shutdown, also other servers don’t exist don’t even bother looking for them trust us even if they did exist which they don’t you would rather enjoy a nice sponsored authentic Blizzard product) we are going to announce the release of our game wherein we try to get people on unauthorized servers which don’t exist and have never existed to give us their money.”
---
You are the wrongest wrong in wrong town.
---
Most guilds won't take a shadow priest until later raid tiers. You may have to heal until AQ or Naxx. 
---
&gt;Nor can they get anywhere near defense cap
---
Imagine thinking defense cap is necessary. Not even warriors care about defense cap these days. The damage in Vanilla simply isnt high for it to matter outside a few select fights.
---
Consider that Druids can reach armor cap. Getting crushed for 2000 damage and crit for 2500 doesnt matter at all when you have 13-15k HP, and healers can literally never run oom because of how short the fights are these days when DPS know how to gear and play.
---
No it makes sense because April 10th is my birthday ! Thank you Blizzard :o
---
"They will announce a release date when they know for 100% certain how much development time is left to deliver a completed product."
---
Have you not paid attention to the video game business over the last 20 years?
---
Ahh Shadowbane, now that's a name I have not heard in a long time.  That was a real MMO. 
---
Crowfall is basically Shadowbane 2 though. 
---
&gt;Bear tanks are not viable or needed until well after the dungeon is on farm status and they are way overgeared.
---
Fuck me, this subreddit has a lot of idiots.
---
That feeling when you accidentally click the wrong ability while respeccing for the 100th time...
---
If she goes healer you should def go warrior.
---
Rogue, Hunter, Warlock, Shaman, and Druid. Hmm.. 
---
Shaman definitely sounds interesting! I like that you have the versatility of doing damage, but also providing utility through healing. 
---
How viable is ele sham in PvP? What are some of the downsides of shaman? I have never played a shaman, not even on retail, so I don't know much. 
---
My instinct is for just leveling, locks combo better with paladin than mages. Mage leveling is all about frost aoe grinding, whereas locks just dot dot dot lifetap drain. With a healer, forget the drain. You will never run out of mana and can kill large groups and elites that would overrun other duos.
---
For pvp I have a bit less insight, but locks lack tools like frost nova, blink, and ice block. Paladins bring blessing of freedom, cleanse, and stuns. It really covers a lot of their weaknesses nicely. I would love to be a lock with a pocket pally in pvp. :)
---
It's about the the millionth time I see this question.
---

---
First you won’t be hardcore unless you are in high school , unemployed or retired 
---
Second just quit 
---
Well if they were following the typical convention then they would have announced it 3 years ago 
---
You don't need tailoring 300 to wear those items; you just need it to craft them.
---
I guarantee I'm not a shill, but TipsOut just did an 'in depth' guide for prot warrior and one of the specs was a hybrid DPS/tank spec where you pick up impale and go the rest in prot (with a few points in the +crit as well in fury).  
---
It was I believe 17/3/31.  The actual 'source' was a player named Skarm and he makes his own videos as well that deserve watching. 
---
If you have any kind of DPS gear, you can always just throw it on and stay as that 17/3/31 spec.  You still have shield slam, overpower/whirlwind, and tons of survivability so you can still effectively farm single target in a pretty safe, consistent way.  You could also wear a few pieces of your best defense gear as well and get hit like a wet noodle.  
---
You could also farm with a friend.. An end game tank could pair up with a priest, paladin/sham, or druid to pretty easily AOE farm instances like SM.  Cath is the easiest- lots of corners to make casters run to you via LOS and a shield spike + any kind of AOE / heals will do the trick easily.  
---
Druid would be OK, just use level 60 hots, thorns, and then a hurricane later in the pull.   
---
Shaman could also do it with stoneskin, magma totem / fire nova, and healing stream with lesser heals on you when needed.  
---
Paladin would be tough as you just have Ret aura and nothing else so it'd be a long slog, two Derp masters in thicc armor =P  
---
Priest would be easy- holy nova solves ALL problems they barely need you in the first place =P
---
Yes, I thought of this yesterday but wasn't brave enough to post it as a question.
---
That's part of a compromise the community wanted.
---
On one hand you had the people who did not want flying because it "destroyed the game".
---
On the other hand you had the people who desperately wanted to fly, especially those who had spent lots of time and even money to buy the shop mounts. It had also been in the game for almost a decade at that point in time. 
---
Both had valid arguments which resulted in the pathfinder compromise(flying). It basically just says: do all the launch relevant content and by the middle of the expac, after doing that relevant content you are allowed to fly.
---
They should have lifted most if not all the restrictions in earlier expacs, I agree.
---
There's a chance of new houses coming in. It's in the nicest area in my town and there is constant development going on. I have a friend who used to work for the company as a lineman. His explanation for how they increase the speed is that they have a box with several ports on it. Generally there is a house hooked up on each port. As a way to double a customer's speed, they can run a line from another port to the house and band the two connections together. So at that point, one house is occupying two ports on the box. If they have a box set up to host 15 houses on a street, but each of the houses is taking up two ports, there is not enough room for new houses without building a new box. I tried to imply that existing customers might be interested in using up some of the new ports if a new box was installed so that they can get the dual banded internet at their house. The people I have talked to kinda brushed me off as if to say, "That's not how it works." And that may not actually be how it works. It's just what I've been told. Maybe someone with more experience in DSL can offer more insight.
---
It's just an incredibly frustrating situation. I've dealt with them my entire life since they are the only option in the area. They have a monopoly so there's no real drive for them to do better. Perhaps I could get a petition together with some of my closest neighbors expressing interest in adding new ports. 
---
I read this post and was like “that sounds familiar” only to click it and see I commented on it lol.
---
If people want to be contrarian and inefficient, let them. But why you would want to suffer is beyond me. I really enjoyed healing, but even if I didn’t it is still the most efficient way to do what your class is designed to do then fuck around once you’ve hit a nice plateau.
---
This got uploaded just as I finished the prior episode my lucky day

Ouch ! Thank you :-)

Only 15%, druid is 50% though.

Omg this showed up on my Reddit homepage last night and I couldn't figure out what sub it came from. It drove me nuts looking for it. I feel better now that I've found it, albeit accidentally.

At some point they changed it to put your hearth on CD. Was that not in vanilla?
---
Mage always reminds me about instant pyroblasts
---
Priests are such good healers because they have options. Paladin heals are single-target spam, so they heal tanks. Shaman heals are chain heal spam, so they heal raids. Druids do a lot of non-healing things (innervate, decurse, etc) on top of the HoTs. Priests are the defacto healers because they can do all three: single-target tank heals, group healing with prayer of healing, and HoTs through renew.
---
I'm not trying to undermine the other classes because they're all good healers in different roles. I wanted to point out that priests are capable of filling *any* of he healing roles. With those options, priests are a fun healing class. They're only considered "boring" if you consider healing in general boring.

Honest question,

I started in patch 2.0 but didn't hit max until the last patch before TBC. (I started young and quite frankly I was terrible until wrath.)
---
I've only ever heard bears were terrible, are they actually valid in classic? If so I'm going to cry tears of joy

Dailies sucked, period.  I preferred doing a single daily with a single goal.  **Netherdrake anyone!!!?????**

if you like to heal then it doesnt matter.  he probably hated to be play healing roles.  for me i find dps in pve to be fucking mind numbing
---
My biggest complain with oblivion is the "dynamic enemies". No matter how much I level, I never feel stronger because the enemies are invisibly buffed to offer the same relative difficulty.

This goes against the very essence of a fantasy RPG.

Oblivion story and character creation were great though!

There are lots of exciting things coming in the broadband industry right now. There's T-Mobile, Verizon's 5g, and a local fiber company who is getting grants for expansion in the area. It will all be after the Classic release, unfortunately. I'll be the first to jump on board when it arrives though! Until then, I've gotta find a way to make due with what is available.

Napkin math for Deathbringer with average damage of 163.5 assuming we got a warrior with 1000 AP and 25% crit:
---
weapon_damage = base_weapon_damage + (X * attack_power / 14), 
---
where X is equal to 2.4 for 1h and 3.3 for 2h weapons due to normalization.
---
163.5 + (2.4*1409/14) = 405 WF damage hit with imp. WF 
---
163.5 + (2.4*1315/14) = 389 WF damage hit without imp. WF.
---
Let's assume that in a minute long fight we land 40 hits (Autoattacks and yellows) capable of proccing WF with this weapon. 
---
40*0.2 = 8 WF procs in a minute and 2 of them are crits with 2x damage, 
---
(405*6+819*2)/60 = 67.5 DPS from improved WF.
---
(389*6+778*2)/60 = 64.8 DPS from usual WF. 
---
Keep in mind that it is a terrible estimation, you can download the warrior DPS Excel [spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0K52-VEkRDTeWI3U3V2LTVVYUk)  for a better one which accounts for many more factors , but the results are still extremely low (10 or less DPS) even with all the consumables/world buffs etc.
---
If you are 100% bound on never respeccing then either choose Hunter or Warlock. Hunter raid with an MM spec that is good (not the best, but good) for PvP. Warlocks have a nice PvE/PvP hybrid spec in SM/Ruin (instead of DS/Ruin for raiding or SL or Destro for PvP).
---
However, I find this to be a unimportant restriction. In vanilla everyone has to farm and make money for both raiding and PvP anyways. Respeccing costs are just a fraction of what you want to spend on raid and pvp consumables etc. if you want to be one of the best in both.
---
Also keep in mind that if you are PvP focussed, then raiding casually is just fine for aquiring gear upgrades now and then. No amount of gear can make up for ability and coordination. Especially if you play a "high skillcap" class like Hunter/Warlock etc. A good Hunter in blues (PvP focussed gear with high stamina etc.) and a PvP spec can easily dominate full epic T2 Warriors/Rogues who spend most of their time doing PvE content and so on.
---
You think you want a release date, but you don't. 
---
Sounds like you're between a rock and a hard place my dude.  Building off of what Syntality suggested, reach out to T-Mobile, Verizon, and Google.... tell them about the monopoly and how shitty they are.  Fingers crossed man.  
---
Dailies in Classic equals Repeatables.  
---
Runecloth farming for hours. Before you know it, it'll be 3:30 a.m. and you'll be wondering if a daily really isn't all that bad.
---
The problem for me is that it's much more directed than just "farm gold". The game's telling you exactly what to do and when. It may not seem like a big deal, but it reduces player freedom tangibly.  I prefer a more open-ended experience. WoW was never exactly a "sandbox" MMO, but it became much more "themepark" in BC/WotLK. 
---
Depends whether blizzard rolls with true progressive itemization or if they are gonna pussy out and only do the easy part.
---
no
---
I've got about 15+ of these laying around
---
Only naxx really makes other content irrelevant, but you will still be clearing MC weekly and miss that one item or whatever all the way up into AQ.
---
In a way, it was an investment house that I've made improvements to. I should be able to sell it and make plenty of money off of it, which is a likely scenario. It's a shame though because I really love the house and the location.
---
Elemental shaman are beasts in PvP! That's actually the main reason people roll elemental. 
---
The downside to shaman is the mana issues. They are monsters of burst damage but they go OOM very quickly, which is why they don't show up in raids much. That isn't a problem in PvP and dungeons because the fights are much shorter. Aside from the mana issues, shaman are not great solo levelers so getting to 60 might take a little longer than you want if you're in a hurry.
---
Let's use names for an easier understanding. 
---
- Me, Blubbstrahl, is your average classic player. I will only play classic. Let's say on average I will make about 1000 Gold a month. With professions, dungeon runs and so on. 
---
- You, Kosouda, don't have that much time to farm 1000 gold a month through professions or other means, but you still want to cover your costs for raid consumables or even raidboosts.
---
Now let's say we both meet each other in game by chance. We do some dungeons and quests together and become friends. As I'm only interested in casual content I don't need that much money, but you are heavily interested in endgame raiding. So we make a deal: I give you my 1000 classic gold in exchange for whatever is deemed the equivalent in retail gold. Let's assume ~200.000 gold, the price of a token.
---
Now Kosouda effectively bought 1000 classic gold, and Blubbstrahl can use the 200k retail gold to buy a token himself (which he can use to buy other Blizzard games or simply convert it to gametime).
---
The gold is not leaving the system, it just switches between those with a lot of time to play to those who don't play as much or don't play as effectively. The 1000 classic gold stays in classic, only the owner changes (to the benefit of both players). Over time the exchange rates will obviously change, but the system will stay. 100%. 
---
And this is where third party sites come into play: they connect players who want to sell their classic gold with people who want to buy it.
---
I'm not going to link to any of those sites, but they usually operate through some sort of "forum gold" scheme. Where people simply sell their virtual items (in this case classic gold) for Forum Gold, and other players will buy that classic gold with their Forum Gold.
---
And there is no way for Blizzard to effectively combat this. There is no chinese gold farmer they can target because he/she has a dozen heavy goldtransactions a day. The community itself will make goldbuying a thing, just like in retail.
---
And as for maintaing a "core ethos for Vanilla", well good luck with that. People on private servers are already willing to pay for gold, and in their case they even actively harm the realm economy because the gold is generated out of thin air. What makes anyone think that those people will abide to any sort of special ethos for Vanilla...
---
Dailies in TBC were okay. I've never played beyond that so I'm not sure what they became. I think what people are overlooking with daily dungeons, at least, is the fact that they keep dungeons alive. Once the server is a bit older and the population is more geared overall, it becomes hard for new players to find groups for lesser liked dungeons like LBRS or full Scholo.  The dailies give incentives to end game players to keep running lower content which in turn keeps the server much more active. I didnt mind them so much. Choose to do them or dont; nobody is forcing you. 
---
So you think Greens are likely because it is easier?
---
Lmao.  I have linked a blue post.  You have done nothing but make shit up and then this crap when I ask for your sources.

Hi, /u/Frostedflex

I live outside of Chicago and have a Sprint plan with unlimited data on my LG V30+ that becomes our backup internet connection using the built-in WiFi hotspot.  Speedtest gives us 26.2 down/3.7 up.  I use it frequently at work on my lunchbreaks for online gaming without issue.
---
It all depends on where you live, but maybe changing carriers &amp; plan can give you better performance built into your phone for use just with WoW.  Just my suggestion!  Simpler is better :)
---
True progressive itemization is a waste of time and resources.
---
We're getting 1.12, with some items gated with content.
---
just roll a nelf druid. forget about those savages and their totems.
---
UC is probably the easiest city to get around in for either faction. UC and org are connected via zeppelin so avoiding org for the most part shouldn't be too tough.  Its a big circle and the hub is in the center. Its very easy to get to every corner of the city from the entrance so you can get through your to-do list quickly. Its going to be difficult to stay completely away from Org. Its the SW of the horde, but UC is a pretty popular city as well. Trolls and orcs don't have to run across the barrens to get to org and take the zeppelin to tirisfal glade like taurens do. Just food for thought.
---
It was just over 10 by coincidence. I don't make any money off of Youtube (no ads on my videos) 
---
If you’re a casual, you’re hardly spending gold as it is. 
---
How is 4g/lte service around you? There is a service that will allow you to use 2 unlimited data plan sim cards side by side to increase the data banwidth. For example if you get 20 mbs on 1 sim.a d 20 mbs on another you can.merge them for like 30-35mbs internet speed.

Couldn't wait to show you his hammer of justice

As I look it up, most 2h weapons vendor for 6-8g. Barbarous Blade which drops from King Gordok quite often, vendors for 7g30s. But, only like 3 classes will use a 2h weapon, and they vendor quite well, so that’s why I recommend them. 
---
What exactly do you think farming is? Killing random mobs in the world?!
---
There's tons of ways to make gold using professions and doing dungeon runs that you don't have to be a dps to do. 
---
No it’s like you have to grind BWL for the sceptre quest before going in to AQ40 at Lv80 (wotlk). 
---
Where you could solo some of the bosses depending on mechanics.  (I soloed half of MC a week when I was boored back then).  
---
When wotlk was released they put a skillbook up for sale in starting zones.  Same for wotlk once cats begun.  It’s like saying sure here it is for some gold.  
---
Even better is just sending your pet in and gathering while the pet takes all the aggro.  
---
I entirely misunderstood what you were saying.  I thought you were telling him to just snag a cheap blue 2h and whatever blues for dps, so he didn't have to worry about fighting actual dps for dps gear.
---
I know ff7 has block characters but I dont think it looks 'bad'. Just dated. To me the game is still fun to boot up and play every couple of years
---
Which items are you talking about?
---
What it came down to for me was what I would be most satisfied playing. On retail I would change mains every new raid release and expansion release. But even after be mythic geared I was never satisfied and kept going back to shaman. I realized I’d much rather make it work with a class that might not be the strongest at that moment than be top of the meters with a class I wasn’t invested in. 
---
So for classic I’m rolling shaman again even though they aren’t the most amazing in pvp. Because if I roll rogue and dominate pvp I just won’t be nearly as satisfied than making it work with my shaman. 
---
If you play a class you aren’t emotionally invested in you will regret it. As cool as that hunter looks in dragonstalker. Or as much as you want to play a rogue and be top of the meters. Will you really be satisfied.  
---
I liked dailies when they first came out in BC because there were a few spots that became PVP hotzones while everyone is trying to get them done. I wouldn't mind if dailies made an appearance in a low key way like maybe just a few in a certain area.
---
Waste of time and resources implementing the item changes that has already been figured out way in advance that we have a full database about? 
---
Progressive itemization with time gating is terrible, I've seen it myself on K3 and it was an absolute joke. 
---
I didn't mean to imply Blizzard would verbally credit Nostalrius, I meant, Blizzard probably doesn't even think of Nostalrius on a day to day basis. They aren't going to do anything at all relative to Nostalrius going forward, IMO.
---
This is true, but as a healer with no good way to kill people normally in world PVP on a PVP server... it felt good.
---
You can do all dungeons ez pz in fury spec. Hell you will have piercing howl for kiting and breaking auto attack timers if you need to, something I sometime can miss when tanking with raid optimal fury build.
---
Just have a sword n board +full plate set ready and you should be good. 
---
Played all vanilla as a warrior and I've always had these "must be nice being a priest" thoughts.. but never rerolled. I'm gonna be a priest this time. :D
---
You would define me as a casual almost assuredly.  I still raid and pvp, and I still need consumes, enchants, repairs, certain boe pieces, and an epic mount....
---
LTE is not bad most of the time. I usually get at least 2 bars inside the house, sometimes 3. Outside, I can usually pull 4 bars in the yard and 5 on the road. If there was a way to consistently get 3 or 4 bars I think I would be set. The 2 sim card thing sounds interesting. I wonder if this is available through Verizon. I'll have to do some research.
---
It will be easier yes, which one is more likely I do not know.
---
Bears are very viable. People never looked too closely at them during Vanilla and this idea that they are not viable tanks has prevailed ever since and been passed down like truth ever since.
---
The fact is they are very much competitive tanks for almost every single bossfight in the game. On the bosses you cannot tank, you usually have other things you can do which a protwarrior just never can. Decurse/Abolish on Chromaggus and Viscidus f.ex, or just shift into Catform and use catDPS gear and do way more damage than a protwarrior could while buffing 3% crit aura.
---
yep, it is really strange. i recently leveled an alt on a different server to level 5 so that i could buy some cheap low level greens and transmog them (i know, i know). while it wasn't a big deal for one of the higher level toons i had on that server, i was shocked to find out just a level 5 gloves, boots and legs were adding up to 80+ gold when i honestly wouldn't have that much until like.... the 60s or 70s.
---
Breaking an arm isn't that bad compared to losing a leg...
---
I play with Xbox controller. Did you play with mouse and keyboard? I used mouse + keyboard for 5 minutes before I went and plugged my controller in and never looked back. I really like the combat controls. The camera can be a bit wonky at times though. It turns away from what I'm fighting and shows me a wall.
---
The storytelling is fenomenal. I hardly ever appreciate story driven games (generally much more a fan of mechanic driven games), but in this case I was just blown away. It's pretty linear, so you can't talk to any random villager, but I have yet to encounter a "kill 10 bears" kind of quest. They always come fully voiced, with a backstory and thought put into them, which is impressive considering the amount of quests in the game.
---
I read in reviews that the game is much more fun to play on harder difficulties, so I booted it up on Death March (hardest) from the beginning, and I love it. You accually need to care about what potions to get/use, need to look at your beastiary and figure out the weaknesses of some enemies, and be careful when fighting new monsters while figuring out their abilities and attacks.
---
Playtime has nothing to do with being casual. 
---
Depends on your faction.
---
But Night Elves in general make good hunters for PVP and PVE.
---
Shadowmelding with a stealthed cat is a great way to watch a flag and get the jump on someone.
---
I meant it more in the sense that some classes need a million types of gear, warriors will need to be able to tank which takes practice and not only that the commitment of farming ALOT of consumes etc 
---
I didnt know this.  Interesting.  I always thought there was no cap.  
---
TBH shaman changed so much with TBC that you can't really compare it. Maybe you won't even like vanilla shaman.
---
/camp to return to the entrance was not in vanilla, and I could swear this was nerfed several times during vanilla already.
---
My friend does it through Verizon cause he's in bumfuck nowhere and there's no internet available like in your case. He said once he started doing that he gets like 100mbs unlimited for like $100 a month or something. The problem I only see is that when I used to use 4g to play wow in MOP you can play the game, but for some reason you can't download/update it due to the way mobile internet packets work. IDK if blizzard ever fixed that 
---
Yea because people improving 13 years later is unlikely. Have you watched Joanna’s WR videos? He has the entire run uploaded. Not even considering the time saves from improving his route, his mechanical play is terrible by today’s standards.. he can literally save hours by strafing instead of back pedal and using auto loot.
---
My brother is a stubborn idiot who didn't want to learn to read.
---
So I plopped him down in front of my account, loaded up a new Dwarf Hunter, and told him to figure it out.
---
He's going off to be a CPA.
---
To add onto this, MC had 2 legendaries as part of its loot table. You will have people constantly running for tfury (best tank/sword rogue 1h in vanilla) and two handed mace classes trying to get sulfuras. 
---
On top of that, the t2 pants drop off rag, and the weapons available from him were very good (especially the perditions blade).
---
In addition to MC, BWL was frequently run due to the gear just objectively being better. Not enough time passed between AQ and Naxx's releases so you had guilds skipping many of the bosses in AQ40 in favor of getting naxx gear. So progression might look like: dungeons -&gt; ZG/MC -&gt; BWL -&gt; AQ20 (for the ability books)/naxx.
---
the hardest part about pally healing is remembering your blessings only last 5 minutes.
---
also early leveling is imo fucking awful on a pally.
---
That's a really problematic way to speak to someone. Why are you so toxic? Who hurt you? 
---
this is a gatekeeping I can get behind
---
You don’t need to go prot for any classic content, at any stage. Anyone who tells you differently doesn’t know what they’re talking about. 
---
No, your post is about them deciding a release date. OP's post is about *when* that release date is announced. But yes, I also doubt it'll have any influence. Just a fun theory.
---
That's what I'd always assumed, that the utility alone was valuable. But I'd always been told in retail druids were only good for healing and abolish :c as a druid main it made me sad 
---
I'm open to either faction honestly. But say I want to roll Horde, am I obligated to be orc? For the pet damage? 
---
Oh no, that's a scary thought. I know I'm having some trouble with connecting to devices like my smart thermostat and NAT issues with xbox's. Hopefully that doesn't apply to the launcher.
---
Another reason to roll Shaman then...
---
If money isn't really an issue, you should be able to contact the ISP and ask them to install a business line, gonna cost a decent amount but you'll have internet after that.
---
other option is to "accidentally" break the box where the ports are at. 
---
The download issue might be a carrier imposed restriction as well... Could get an extra phone and jailbreak it to work around that
---
So you said in another comment that you work at a pizza joint. 
---
Assuming you’re not management, just tell them you need to be taken off the schedule for a month. If they ask, say you’ll be out of town or something. 
---
As a one time manager of a large pizza delivery chain, we never really fired good employees, and since it was a college town people left during the summer and we would welcome them back in the fall. Delivery drivers were pretty much always needed. In store people, not as much, but the turn over rate was high anyway since it’s a minimum wage job. 
---
You might be given less hours on return, but you also might not. 
---
If you’re management, you pretty much can’t do that without losing your job. 
---
The other question you need to ask yourself is if it’s even worth doing this. 
---
Answer: No. 
---
Kinda seems like using cellular is your best bet at the moment.  There's definitely signal boosters you can buy... I was looking at a roof mounted one for my RV awhile back.
---
I fucking loved the crystal simon says...
---
I hold onto a lot of items and wait until someone does this, swoop in and undercut them by 1 copper.
---
I mean, warlocks pretty much cast shadowbolt nonstop, and mages cast frostbolt/firebolt nonstop. There's several bland classes in raiding, priests aren't the only ones. 
---
The ones listed under Tailoring.
---
Also idk if the internet company has looked into it but if you are located like 25 miles from their main branch or where ever they are located there is a possibility you can  Recieve wi-max which is a wireless signal they send out and is even better than dsl. Just most call center employees won't know about it.
---
I've looked into a couple of these as well but I'm a little hesitant to drop a lot of money on a project like this without knowing if it will be stable. Have you had any luck with your RV?
---
just go play on a pserver. If anything its hyping me up more and i cant wait to do it for real.
---
Nope I asked blizzard support and they said it was on their end, and that they didn't have plans for it at the time.
---
I got a fire mage to the 50s in vanilla. While I enjoyed the spec, I think frost would've been better in the long run for survivability and utility (played on a PVP server). 1 for 1 I was killing single target about the same as frost, I just had some more aoe options as fire. 
---
Just keep in mind that you actually had certain mobs that are immune to your elements and others that take extra damage from you. For example: the tar beasts in un'goro take 50% more damage from fire abilities. Might be worth speccing fire if you're leveling in that area. 
---
It was Garrisons that did it to me. When I was logging in for ten minutes each morning before work to tic off missions and start up new ones, I kind of had a "am I really taking time out of my morning to do this...?" moment.
---
But of course now I've gotten into some mobile gacha games, so scrubbing off dailies is just sort of my norm now.
---
Thanks for all your replies, I don't feel worried at all now. It's gonna be fun experiencing all of that magic that I never got to be part of. See you in Azeroth! 
---
I am within 25 miles. I'll ask about this and see if it's something they offer.
---
Real vanilla heads go to desolace and feralas. 
---
I ended up not buying one (RV is currently in storage)... but I have folks that I follow on IG that use signal boosters for their RVs and they swear by them because they love going out in the woods for awhile and just chilling.  So it'd definitely be an option, albeit a little pricey.
---
Good luck man, all I know is sat internet is really expensive and not worth it unless you are shelling out huge amounts of money. I hope you find a work around cause it's not just for classic hahaha internet is needed for basic tasks nowadays
---
It's been so long that I forgot. Was there even degredation on respec costs? I'm pretty sure if there was it was a long time before it dropped the cost of respeccing. 
---
In Gadzetzan I would line up aimed shots/ multishots on my hunter on lowbie clothies so I could kill them and FD right after before the guards killed me.  AFK mages were the bested because it guaranteed crits.
---
I remember helping my downstairs neighbor learn english when i lived in sweden and he'd ask me to occasionally translate a word on quest text.
---
I miss that guy, cant help wondering where he is or how he's doin.
---
Fredrick Erickson i think was his name.
---
Karazhan.
---
Just Karazhan.
---
Preface: I don't know what the actual fuck I'm talking about.  
---
Would it be possible to build a receiver tower on the roof to grab that wireless signal? Dunno if its feasible, cost efficient, or even possible but yeah I'm dumb but just a thought.
---
&gt;	accepted them lying down 
---
This is a generalization. Some people really like daily quests, myself included. It’s one of the things I’ll miss in Classic.
---
I watched a super interesting documentary on people addicted to WoW called "/AFK" on youtube yesterday. The whole time I was like "shit that could have been me..." my marriage almost ended because of WoW... then I got my wife to play it.
---
Not at all, Trolls are actually better for hunter with their passive and Taurens are underestimated as hunters, because Warstomp allows you to get away from the enemy if they get too close.
---
Hi, /u/Jester2008
---
Priorities haha.
---
For the amount of money you have to dish out for satellite, you'd think it would be phenomenal. You're right, it's not just for games. That's the angle I tried to approach it at with the company. I'm a software developer who sometimes has to work from home. They made a promise to me that I would have their service at the house and now I cannot work from home because of it. 
---
I agree. When i hear people around me speak english i usually speak it much more fluent. Then i start to think why that is and the only explanation i have for it is playing wow for years. Reading, hearing and speaking it all day. Without thinking about it you learn a LOT. Im actually studying swedish right now and hoping to join a swedish guild in Classic just for the learning purpose (and for playing the game ofcourse) 
---
I'm that friend he's talking about :) Love you bro
---
I stopped playing TBC around the sunwell patch, and it was directly related to burnout from dailies.
---
I didn't mind the stuff like the nether drake grind. I did hate doing those quests daily, but at least there was an end to it. You get your drake, you never have to do one of those again. Dailies now never end.
---
All Raids in vanilla stay relevant for different reasons.
---
You will be fine. 
---
&gt;Because it hyperinflates the pockets of nolifers
---
This will always be the case no matter what. You can never make a system that dont greatly benefit the people willing to spend much much more time investing into it than others.
---
Not sure what your solution is here.
---
Montreal is a great city. But it did always surprise me how resistant residents there were to learning English. Glad you learned. 
---
Purging / frost shocking mages while they have 20+ mobs around them, causing them to get a durability loss.
---
ITS NOT MY OPINION THAT COUNTS BUT YOURS
---
I'll take what I can get. ;P
---
Was it vanilla when it often ported you to the nearest GY and put your HS on cooldown too? Or was that a later addition. 
---
Really its only useful for DM farming and Vael.  Its also great to have when attempting to get Benediction - drop the rank and use as your "oh shit" button when you're out of holy waters.  
---
&gt;/camp to return to the entrance was not in vanilla
---
Proof?
---
My biggest fear about Classic is the mindset from live or seemingly from private servers will bleed in; where the game has been "solved" many years and everyone will be expected to min/max with stuff that wasn't known in the original Classic.  A big part, from what I have read, was that since a  lot was not known and you could experiment, without the modern "Use the recommended raiding spec or GTFO" mindset.
---
It's a scary prospect for someone who has never played Vanilla to consider being told you're doing things wrong when in 2004 it wasn't considered wrong.
---
Where do I get a hunter pet like that?
---
Yikes.
---
You do have more flexibility with dps specs in 5 mans due to fights being shorter and mana issues not being as much of an issue.  
---
Thank you for this post my friend.
---
The THERE IS ONLY ONE way mantra from our past is still alive and that saddens me. These are the same types that created the gearscore addon later. Lots and LOTS of people where shut out by non bending elitists.
---
As much as parts of the live game now tore away the fabric of social and overall enjoyment of the game, the one thing Blizzard did in trying to change the community by trying to make it where you "Bring the player, not the class"
---
Before I get jumped, I am aware that mechanics, player skill, and the items at the time of classic did indeed give certain specs and classes more viability, but that does not mean it is or will be the only way.
---
You think you do but you don't 
---
There's an array of antennas on the market, but there's mixed reviews on them. I would love to find a company that would be willing to let me try one for a few days. I've sent emails to a couple of them but have not heard back yet. I'm a software guy, so not so strong on the hardware/electrical side of things, but I would be down to try a DIY antenna when I get some free time from working on the house.
---
I never even considered Taurens. Mostly because I forgot about dead zones. I've mained hunter since I started playing at the tail end of BC. Always been Orc. Thanks for the info!
---
Every DPS spec is usable in 5-man content (Ret pallies and feral druids included). Obviously the top tier is still going to be best but I've never had issues bringing sub-optimal specs into 5-mans. Your tank and healer determine your success in dungeons. The biggest difference is the length of fights, importance of CC and difficulty of bosses, all of which differ from raids.
---
&lt;3
---
Structured dailies? YES I am glad!!
---
Let me make my own check list for the day!! 
---
The thing is that 5man is not a challenge, as soon as you have a minimum of stuff. so basically, you can play whatever you want, even if non optimal, it will not be an issue in 5 man.
---
That’s why all the videos do not talk about this
---
I quit just before wrath came out, and dailies were a part of the reason why I quit. It was a very obvious grind that I didn't want to do. Sure I didn't *have* to do it, but it helped me realize what a grind the game had become for me and I didn't want to do it anymore. If they got even *worse* after that then I made the right decision to quit when I did.
---
To me it's not good to require more than 9 hours to grip someone into their game. I got into vanilla wow in less than an hour and was already hooked. 
---
I'll pick Witcher back up sometime but just saying it got off to a rocky start with me. 
---
Playing Warcraft III and its expansion is what I’m doing to refresh myself on story and try to satisfy my hunger for classic WoW. 
---
Obesity.
---
But you can though.
---
Pserver progressive itemization is not 100% accurate, and blizzard does not have all the data for non 1.12 patches.
---
Depends on your definition of boring. At the end of the day all healers are doing roughly the same thing but some have a lot more utility or have to keep timers in mind to be as mana efficient as possible. People can find these traits fun or tedious depending on how they want to heal, and that's what I love about Classic. Even then your spec, the people you meet and what content you are participating in will dictate whether you enjoy it or not as well. So take some time to look at the spells and learn if the class is active enough for you to stay engaged.
---
Personally, in order from least fun, to most fun: 
---
Pally, Priest, Druid, Shaman. Others will disagree with me, and this isn't in order of which is the strongest healer, but that's just my personal preference because I enjoy micromanagement.
---
Now you have to level one toon to 120, complete every questline, and run a couple of dungeons...just to create the new toon you really want to play.
---
This game is designed by morons.
---
Why is fire crit-dependent? The crit bonus with fire is only slightly larger than with frost.
---
they dont share CD?
---
That wont send you to the entrance it will send you to your hearth location.
---
Well, that was basivally WoD until 6.2 when **three** more dailies were added.
---
But WoD had fundamental problems with its content outside of raiding.
---
Yeah it's one of my biggest complaints about modern wow but I didn't notice too much in Oblivion. I agree though.
---
Oblivions strong point is definitely the side quests and guilds, as well as the main story. Where I feel like Skyrim looks better and plays better but isnt fun because I felt like nothing changed when I did big things. The guilds were so underwhelming when you are the leader or something and people don't care lol 
---
&gt;What exactly do you think farming is? Killing random mobs in the world?!
---
Should be pointed out that this is the worst and most inefficient method to farm gold by any class, including DPS.
---
Thanks for calming me, Walt
---
It's a tale as old as time!
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3KgEqQWCZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3KgEqQWCZM) 
---
Enchanting 
---
Elemental is fantastic in PvP, but if you don't mind rolling some dice Enhancement Shaman can be just as ridiculous.
---
I think you should roll priest as well.  I don’t know how good Resto shamans were in TBC PvP but in vanilla I couldn’t stand how gimped they were.  There’s no way you are getting chain heals off with a mage and rogue on you.  Priests have a much greater toolkit for healing in PvP.  You will be extremely disappointed when you PvP as a Resto Shaman in classic.
---
Watch Warcraft speedruns on youtube and you will be set! Fast and a fun way to get into the lore.
---
Actually, going to do so myself now! 
---
ROFL.. Ok sparky. Glad you got life figured out.
---
I see, I played Warcraft II and III when I was little but didn't get was they was saying at that time xD  
---
But the question remain, should I look for the story before the release or discover everything during the game ?
---
HATE dailies, bullshit grind fest of "HAVE TO" events otherwise you're half useless. Lazy game design, good riddance. 
---
It was the idea that you didn't have to use your own imagination or thought process on what you should do in-world.  We were becoming zombies, log in, do the dailies, sit and wait for the daily heroic / daily dungeon -- and GET BORED.
---
We used to encourage world PVP by taking over BRM, taking over a zone, etc.  Then we're zombiefied and told to do dailies for prizes.
---
And that's pretty much when a lot of us began to leave.
---
Horde
---
I think I did controller. I just am picky with combat in games. Most games have really bad combat imo. But the movement was a clunky experience for me so I remember Witcher being particularly annoying with combat. 
---
I really wanted to enjoy it for some of the quest lines I heard about so much. I'll play it again some day.
---
Yeah, I try not to think about Crowfall because I'm scared it will suck! Last I checked it was still in early development but that was monthd ago. Any news?
---
Nah fuck friends I'm in it for the sweet purps
---
And then what did you do?
---
Did you invite your friends / group to another dungeon?
---
Did you world PVP?  Or just stand / ride around capitol city and scream in /world /trade?
---
I've decided I am multiboxing. 
---
I keep changing between a "Warrior + Priest", or "Druid + Rogue".
---
The warrior and priest would likely be optimal in a leveling and raiding point of view, but I dont really see myself duoboxing while raiding... more I am planning to duobox to ease the leveling and also getting to have 2 lvl 60s without leveling twice.
---
The druid rogue on the other hand has my mouth watering with the prospects of camping STVietnam.
---
Having 2 stealthables that can sneak up and gank people will be amazing. 
---
The leveling should be pretty decent as well, because I'll have the melee/healer combo going. I might have issues with tanking and keeping aggro, but with Sap I should be alright.
---
Are there any gold earning advantages to either of these setups? I havent put a ton of thought into it economically, and would appreciate that feedback.
---
Well, after 13 years of not doing a single run, yeah, I kinda think that is an unlikely improvement.
---
Pservers are just an emulation. Everything that's not in the game files itself is based on either guess work or a game of telephone, with no live reference being available for 13 years.
---
I know people here hold pservers in exceptionally high regard, but I don't know why everyone pretends they are perfectly accurate when even devs and often the server admins don't claim that.
---
But we'll see. These runs are just warm-ups and the real competition will be on official servers.
---
Dailies were alright at launch for Wrath, but the ToC ones were really bad imo, it was the start of the whole daily quest system as we'd come to know it for the next few expansions.
---
Hunters have a real problem with stat scaling and their armor sets past t2. The 54agil to crit is absurd considering what rogues and warriors get. The stats on 2.5 are horrendous, and the set bonuses on 2.5 and 3 are awful. A raid with multiple full t2 hunters is basically peak hunter dps since that 8/8 450AP proc is so strong 
---
As a completely poor scrub player who was in debt to a guildie several hundred gold for 60% flying I loved the addition of QD. 100g from dailies every day which was huge at the time
---
Nolifers will always have more funds than casuals, yes.  However, allowing something to exist that only benefits them widens that gap.  Casuals aren't farming DM at instance/hr cap....most of them don't have time to make it lucrative IF they even know it exists and IF they have the gear and spec to pull it off....and even if they did that would turn into using their *entire* playtime just to try to keep up with inflation on the server.
---
I'm not saying I have a solution.  I don't, and I freely admit it.   I also don't really care if they leave this farming method in or not.   I just see why they may decide no bueno.
---
Make sure your 'buddy' goes first and gets nuked, you are then free to deal with an oom shaman.
---
Dailies need to be compared to their vanilla counterpart, which was mindlessly grinding mobs for gold at cap so you could buy the resources you'd need for your next raid.
---
Not saying dailies are good, but the alternative ain't so great either, it's one of the things I'm least looking forward to for classic
---
Strap in boys:
---
Back in the day when I was a starry eyed paladin on my first romp through Tanaris, I ran into a ?? Undead Spriest. Being a total noob, I had no idea what to do so I tried my best to just ignore her and move about my business. After a few /laughs were made in my general direction, the horror begun: she feared me ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF TANARIS THEN KILLED ME. 
---
Determined to not give up, I corpse ran all the way down to find her dancing on my corpse. I resurrected, bubbled, and mounted up. My foolish brain thought my recently acquired carrot on a stick would give me an edge. Boy was I wrong. She quickly caught up to me and sent me right to the border of Ung’oro. And killed me again.
---
Dismayed, I took res sickness and ran to gadgetzan. After a 10 minute break I came back and peaked out both exits....all clear.  Feeling comfortable, I ran out into the desert to begin my quest when out of the hot, shimmering horizon I see that bloody horse romping my way like a wraith from LOTR. Terrified, I began turning around but it was too late. Off I go, like a crazed lunatic, running down unwillingly to the Uldum gates. Needless to say, after she was done playing with her food, I was swiftly murdered and left to rot under the scorching sun.
---
I did not play the rest of that week.
---
That kicks you to your hearth point not the entrance iirc.
---
His voice is really monotonous... yet so soothing. I always enjoy his videos as well.
---
O.o
---
How in the heck does a speed run give you the lore?
---
But to the OP. Should you? Only you can answer that for yourself. 
---
WarCraft War of the Ancients Archive is a fantastic place to start. IMO.
---
Go to Paris... And please let us talk again over resistant residents... French speaking people don't speak English at all. Most European Countries are good at English nowadays, but not France... 
---
Yes! I really really hate daily quests and world quests!
---
This meme is being over used pretty fast. 
---
&gt; nostalgia is as valid a reason as any to like something.
---
Nostalgia kept me playing retail longer then I enjoyed it.
---
I mean ss a deleted post to shit talk it is extremely petty. Also you still refuse to accept that you get full use of blacksmith keys without being a blacksmith. In the same way you get full use of weapon chain. What do you consider use of a key? I consider it open doors/lock boxes which can be done without ever being a blacksmith in the same way you can have a weapon chain without one. All you do is ignore my argument then insult me and claim you are some argument god... it's actually quite funny
---
This is a good idea thanks.
---
Fo...For the Horde?
---
Honestly with a Mouse+Keyboard mod while emulating it shows that the game holds up pretty well. It's mostly only aged poorly due to the control scheme at the time. 
---
Rise of the Horde is a requirement if you play Horde and are even remotely interested in the story.
---
I met a guy on a trial last week and told him I came back to check out the game and get familiar with the key binds, interface, etc.
---
I told him I can already taste a divorce in my future and see my child going through therapy, wondering why daddy only showed him the back of his head when he spoke.
---
Here's to the grind, the tears, the joy, and the dead Alliance bodies I will be sleeping on top of peacefully every night.
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!

It is tagged if no one else can tag it after your pet.  
---
It is tagged because you can whack it once and get loot

I’m taking a marijuana break so I can get blasted when it’s released
---
Skeleton keys benefits can be gained without being a blacksmith the same way a weapon chain can. The only difference is convenience. Shouting for 2 minutes for a bs anytime you want something open vs shouting anytime you get a new weapon. 
---
Like a record, baby!
---
You'd be surprised. The guildies i run with are just awful at the game, but they're the best people, so they're the ones I enjoy playing with the most. We were struggling with doing season 1 Mythic 2s when they all had like 370 ilvl gear. I got frustrated and joined a "better" guild. We were clearing 11s and 12s pretty easy, but I just missed the players too much, so i had to switch back.

Stroke beard right to match...

There is a distinction to be made first of between a psychological addiction and a chemical addiction. Even if you argue gaming to be in the first, it certainly is not in the last. I'm sure you can see that.
---
Now can video gamers have a psychological addiction? Certainly, an underlying pre-existing one can be had and brought with them when they game. Video games themselves cannot cause a psychological addiction in a person who does not have an underlying one. That is what my studies and teachers tell me. My conclusion (and i am just a student, long while yet till i am psychologist, so seek one if you feel you need it) then is that you already had an underlying pre-existing condition, independently of playing games. WoW is deeply dangerous - to those with a pre-existing condition, not to all of the players who play it. Does that clear things up?
---
This is true. I have a public function in Amsterdam and have to daily show a lot of tourists the way. Almost everyone speaks english because this is kind of the main language but not french people.. they just walk up to me and start entire stories in french and expect me to reply in french and are offended when i dont!
---
Not all french people ofcourse
---
Does this ruin the overall experience? The feeling of suboptimal damage outpit in a raid can be really bothering and demotivating in my experience. What would you say? Is it still worth it to roll a Hunter?
---
Hi, /u/instagibsontv
---
5 mans tend to actually emphasize your class kit more than raids, where you are "just" DPS. This means that even if you don't excel in a traditional raid role, you have other (niche) opportunities. These are usually CC-dependent:
---
DPS druid: LBRS, UBRS (Hibernate)
---
Shadow Priest: Scholo, UD Strat (Shackle)
---
Mage: &lt;Basically everywhere&gt; (Sheep)
---
Ret Paladin: Scholo, UD Strat (Turn Undead)
---
Hunter: &lt;Basically everywhere&gt; (Trap)
---
Sub Rogue: &lt;Basically everywhere&gt; (Sap)
---
Obviously the "good" classes will do well, and as you get into things like 10 man UBRS they tend to be a bit of an AOE fest and CC gets (slightly) less emphasized.
---
This is one instance where I could see making a change to soul shards.
---
Why not let them stack to 20 or so? Is that so game breaking and terrible?
---
That wouldn’t ruin MY classic experience.
---
I liked TBC - it was rich with new content and ideas - but I hated the introduction of dailies. Somehow in Vanilla you always have something to do but for organic reasons that weren't as narrowly defined as chores on a checklist.
---
Same here, I'm from Denmark, and I don't think I learned anything from my English classes other than the few initial ones, just the necessity of having to communicate with other players helped me stay way ahead of the curve. I eventually got top grades in it as well, never got that in anything else, so all the times I skipped homework to play WoW weren't so bad after all.
---
You're not in love with a release date, you're in love with the IDEA of a release date!
---
That extra money went to potions ;)
---
If you’re serious just quit, get a new minimum wage job after
---
Are the heirlooms not gated behind levels anymore? Like you can buy a level 60 heirloom without having a level 60 character already?
---
My first time I had no idea there were talents until L30+. Was it talents or something else. Anyway, I didn't know about something significant for quite a while.
---
&gt;Casuals aren't farming DM at instance/hr cap....most of them don't have time to make it lucrative IF they even know it exists and IF they have the gear and spec to pull off farming it at all....and even if they did that would turn into using their entire playtime just to try to keep up with inflation on the server.
---
Your lack of understanding of economics is mind boggling. WoW's economy has infinite potential supply. It doesnt matter if someone can farm a lot of gold, because all that means is that the amount of gold in circulation goes up.
---
If you are casual and dont have time to farm DM to the cap every hour (Riddiculous example anyway. If you cant find the time to play for an hour straight you wont do good in this game regardless), you can just go out and herb or something instead. Because of inflation, your herbs will sell for a lot more.
---
Inflation actually BENEFIT the casual players. Casuals wont need that much consumables, which is the main thing which will fluctuate in price. On the other hand, every static goldsink like repairs, respec, epicmount etc, will be drastically easier to obtain with inflation.
---
and i said AMEN
---
me too. the pvp was the only thing that made it worth it
---
Oh yeah.
---
I was 9 when I started playing and I remember being ahead of my class in english because I knew words like finger, legs, feet, or key.
---
English education sucks in my country so I'm literally the only one in my group of friends who can watch a tv show in english without subtitles.
---
Wow (or games in general) really make a huge difference.
---
I learnt english by playing minecraft mainly
---
The truth is we just dont know. You might get ported to the HS location, you might get ported to the entrace of the dungeon. No way to know.
---
It’s obviously a success. Many successful private servers and old school RuneScape is proof of that, join us or not that is your choice brother. 
---
I used to MC lowlevel characters and buff them. 
---
Unless it was from a guild that frequently ganked lowlevel chars.  
---
Then I MC and ran them in to a bunch of mobs.   
---
(Where they got equipment cost loss).  
---
nah , can drop from steel lockbox, slimes in EPL cave, AND rings drop from heavy junkbox
---
This whole subreddit is full of old addicts, me included haha.  
---
Yeah, that's what I mean when I say it has aged horribly. The controls are so bad, but I haven't tried it on an emulator with mouse+keyboard, so I can't speak to that, but I'm sure that pretty much fixes the aging quite a bit. It's not an ugly game at all imo, just that the controls are horrendous on the good old N64 controller.
---
"Only one way" wasn't how vanilla was at all besides. It was "we couldn't find a tank so we got a hunter, a warlock, and a crazy shaman. Let's plan well and kick this dungeon's ass."
---
Because you have to crit them and kill them before they get up on you, start pushing back your spells and pushing down your health. Frost keeps them at range for the entire fight so no issue if it takes a little longer.
---
Trying to deduce what's on the right.
---
Not even denying it lol 
---
Goddam this sub likes to down vote and never explain why they disagree. 
---
It’s absolutely still worth it just because how FUN and engaging the class is
---
You should MC them and then force them to kill other players of the same faction. Or MC them and try to run them off a cliff (like in felwood to darkshore). 
---
Or make them delete their account, ninja loot from raids, cause guild drama.
---
That’s not how it works mate, just try on any server 
---
Aha! It's the outstretched hand of a Male Tauren skeleton.
---
In 10s there is not enough time. But sure I killed quite a few ppl with MC jump.  BRD chain and path down to ungoro is good places for that.  
---
what exactly are dailies?
---
This reminds me of when I used to divine intervention my brother on wipes instead of the healers.
---
Hmm it seems people disagree. Why?
---
That's not griefing. That's dedication.
---
In terms of content &amp; reward. TBC was the best IMO. 
---
Swimming belt is super useful as alliance when jumping off that boat and swimming to Onyxia’s lair. You will thank me after you have went to that place every week for 2 years.
---
no, they go oto Stormwind
---
You can buy hotspot Devices from cell phone carriers that provide decent internet. 
---
It's still going along afaik. The animations look janky though, but that doesn't mean it won't be fun. 
---
my fondest memory of WoW was on the queldanas island. Mained a combat rogue and the WOTLK prepatch just came out and the killing spree talent was added. I tried it out on a ally priest that was sitting down drinking, killing him pretty much instantly. Was a massacre on the island for the rest of the day for anything not wearing plate armor lol.

Reddit is being a bit weird, refusing to show our msg history, so i may a bit confused on some points. Did i mention which DSM it was part of? Perhaps i did, though i do not recall. Could you link me the msg you are refering to perhaps? It may be that it is no longer showing because of some individual i choose to block, this is apparently a topic worth cursing over to some.
---
In any case mr Spidehwebb, please follow me here: Your points are well and good to be sure, and if you'd like we can discuss the academy side of it plenty, but my msgs were never aimed at fellow psychology students - or whatever you to happen to be. I do not expect them to misunderstand the DSM (though no1 is perfect to be sure). What i expect to happen is that regular joes, who have no education on the matter, will draw wildly inaccurate conclusions from it in its present state.
---
Let me put it this way: The misunderstandings and ignorance the adding IGD to the DSM is bound to cause is in the everyday folks. People who will now think much more harshly on the amount of playing time they have at the screen, about their children or themselves. Now you can certainly argue for this being a good thing, everyone should do so, but there is a difference that is like to escape their notice: Playing a game for a good many hours because it is compelling, and playing a game because you have a compulsive disorder (or whatever you'd like to call it really), is not the same thing. Headlines such as ''Its digital Heroin for the kids!'' (an example i had in class, i believe it was the new york times or some such) are ridiculous, I'm sure you'd agree. It equates much to the notion that school shooters were turned into violent murderers because they played GTA. Make no mistake, gaming will be used as a scape-goat by the ignorant to excuse away everything from murderers to bad parenting, and adding it to the DSM with its current name gives them the ammo to do so. That is the sort of ignorance and misunderstandings i seek to combat and criticize, not the actual work of scholars (well short of the chosen naming. Imo it would be much more apt to call it a compulsion disorder and then list obscene gaming times as a symptom, but i am certainly not trying to pretend to have any authority on the matter, nor do i believe its a matter that dont deserve attention - just has to be the right, educated and transparent sort of attention.)
---
It was mostly a joke, I guess I hadn't looked at these games in a very long time, I didn't remember what they looked like.
---
I live in the city with gigabit speed service.
---
This doesn't help you at all, I'm just an asshole.
---
If you haven't played a vanilla shaman. You haven't really ever experienced the full shaman experience. You've just come close. Go Tauren and live in Thunder Bluff, it's the nicest Horde city (not for convenience but for aesthetics). Horde has a lot of other good hearth options, like Grom Gol or Kargath.
---
Ive been leveling characters to around level 25 on some undisclosed server trying to figure out what I want to do.
---
\-I know im going to want to heal, I always do.
---
\- I'd rather roll alliance so shaman is out
---
\- Paladin leveling is not really something I want to put myself through, but is arguably the best healer in the game
---
\- Priest,  wanding annoys me, im not totally down with the aesthetic but id be *the* staple healer and shadow is legit for pvp
---
\-Druid, NO OOC REZ, arguably the fastest leveler in the game, stealth is awesome, can level as feral and tank 5 mans and still heal if i want and even cat works for pvp.
---
So ive pretty much decided on nelf druid but not having a rez really feelsbadman
---
I didnt mind the dailies in Isle of Quel'danas either since it promoted an active hotspot in the world  which resulted in a fuckton of world pvp and such. 
---
Also didnt mind the Skettis/netherwing stuff because it made sense and also wasnt a must.
---
Thats about it tho. Fuck dailies/world quests lazy ass concept of trying to replace actual content.
---
Use soulstone on yourself...rez...use jumper cables on priest...they fail..."Sorry bro you had like a 50/50 chance of them working"  I'll be here when you guys get back.
---
I mean it in the sense that you aren't just spamming one button over and over again, a la Rdruid, Hpal, and Rsham at times.
---
Run Strath live, reserve the first orb. If you are a real jew, you can try ressing all the orbs but you will get laughed at, or only get green geared guys joining you.
---
Another thing I can recommend is getting a key to UBRS and always keep tabs on /world, you can make an easy 10g from a quick trip to BRM. 
---
It's because dailies in TBC were a lot more limited and handled in a much better way.  It was OK in Wrath until ToC, then it got a bit overboard, I can't remember how they were in Cata as I didn't play it much, but MoP definitely took them to a whole other level from what we saw in TBC.
---
LOL 
---
...lol
---
When I played private servers I leveled a second account first (60 rogue) who I then had stealth behind all my main account characters while they leveled. Aparently gankers dont like being counter ganked by your stealthed 60 rogue. The amount of hate messages I got and people making alliance characters just to complain was hilarious. If you cant take being counter ganked then maybe stop ganking people in the first place, you but hurt fucks.
---
Yeah, until there's like one or two other druids in the group, at which point you can't really HOT anything ;p. With say 5 raid group members getting damaged, each having one (and only one) HoT per class on 'em. 
---
I'd reaaaaally wait for TBC for a thrilling Rdruid experience. Granted, I'm talking strictly PvE here. However on Hordeside a priest is the only healer who can dispel magic debuffs, which is pretty big.
---
Level 70 pvp during TBC as a shadow priest had me hating rouges 
---
Yup! They were never gated, but they used to cost Justice Points (which is technically a gate :P). As of I beleive MoP they've costed gold. (except the honor ones)
---
For any new people to this sub, you must give this podcast a listen! Josh does an incredible job bringing in top notch players, and in this case old developers, to give their insight on Vanilla.

I'm on the fence about playing Horde in classic (I've always been Alliance). If I were to go Horde it would be to play Shaman, so I'm excited about what Kevin has to say about Shamans this week. 
---
People dont disagree i think, just that what you are saying is obvious. Of course the official version will be more popular.
---
It sounds like r/leagaladvice might be a better place than r/classicwow. It doesn't really matter what you're using the internet for--the company mislead you.
---
Disagreed. Most guilds will. Just not most hardcore guilds which is 2-3 guilds per server or so.
---
Oh God.  Same.  I was a PvE only RESTO shaman on a PvP server.  Life was suffering AND pain.  And lots of death on Quel'Dalas...
---
I've actually never read the Wheel of Time, but it's been on my list a while. Part of the reason it's been a while is because I can't seem to find time to read either!
---
Standard PVE spec 31 in marks, and 15-18 in survival depending if you need the hit talent. If you don’t need hit you can put 5 in BM for imp hawk. Great thing about hunter is this build is very good at pvp also. If you wanted to be full PvP build, I prefer 21/21/9 for the BM stun and scatter shot.
---
Troll is best pve for horde, NE for ally. But for PvP I believe Orc is best for horde, then dwarf for ally. 
---
I once managed to soulstone my Voidwalker...

Dailies is a malicious and manipulative shit mechanics. Being rid of them is almost the best part of classic, and there are so many good parts. I played years of /played during the vanilla-wrath period, yet i doubt i have more than a 100 dailies done playing since. It is meant to take advantage of those with addictive/compulsive tendencies or even underlying conditions, and its foul business practice (and boring besides). Glad you snapped out of it! Did you ever go see a psychologist to get evaluated for a condition?
---
I simply didn't do them so I guess I won't notice much of a difference.
---
bears are impressively strong and people are just now starting to finally realize it. if people made any sort of bear druid post several years ago, itd be downvoted into oblivion automatically. a lot of the stigma is from terrible players in actual vanilla + almost every private server up until recent times completely gutting druid mechanics/abilities which only reinforced the stigma
---
Get a real argument :)
---
I think it would be a fun little wink/nod to recreate the event, with 1 dropping ever before it gets patched back out.  But I don't expect it to be available, realistically speaking.

Heroics were a big problem too...

What do you do for a living? I have to make security rounds every hour. If your not sitting behind a desk have someone break your leg. Good for a month.
---
Yeah, WF procs are insane. They're a little too unpredictable for my tastes, but I mostly recommended elemental to the OP because they wanted something with more versatility and the ability for elemental to toss out heals in addition to the damage seemed more appropriate.
---
Every1 complaining about being forced to do boring grinds like daily quest each day before being able to do anything fun cant remember vanilla realy well. 
---
Standing in a city all day looking for group to run the same instance for the 20th times this week because you need that blue ring from last boss.
---
Or grinding demons for runes and farming herbs for pots or gold for 2 hours before raid starts.
---
etc.
---
I never did them. Especially as a healer, it was such a pain in the ass and boring as hell. I was in a pretty hardcore reading guild in TBC and Wrath and I remember my raid leader getting so annoyed that I never had the proper shoulder enchants and whatever else from daily grinds. I just couldn’t fucking do it. 
---
I would so much rather grind for 5 hours in one night then 30 minutes a day over 2 weeks. 
---
Same. Dailies was like the last activity i did, when every other possibilities were exhausted. 
---
It was removed from the loot table on the same day that it dropped. It was never intended to be in game.

Honestly while the fresh feeling of adventure in 2005 was certainly a powerful and wondrous thing, i almost feel like the one here in 2019 will be even better. We'll go into it knowing we earned it (through the long struggle to get it), that it will (hopefully anyways, never know with activision blizzard these days, do wish we had the blizz of old still) stay true and be the kind of game we want it to be. As a community we will all be old, and all madly in love with the game, which will bring us close i think. It will be a different sort of magic, but magic all the same, and in a way an even more satisfying one.
---
happened to me, shit internet for a year couldn't play games. I survived you will too.
---
The worst part about people like you is when I don't bother chasing you, then realize it is a rogue actually ganking me who I let get an easy opener
---
On one hand, a little sad. I liked the BC version of dailies but on the other hand, absolutely; the current version that exists just became way too monotonous without any story or reason behind it. 
---
I do like daily questions at max level since I'm primarily a quester and completionist more than I am raids (mostly because I have to deal with kids and can't devote the time).
---
But I'm just happy to be back in Classic and it won't bother me too much. There's plenty of exploration and quests to do. :) 
---
I liked how the QD and Netherwing dailies went but some of them got to be too much too often.
---
I thought that was in Vanilla as well.
---
Well, I see you point then ^^
---
Therefore, what I recommend the most is a class that can CC, even if it’s not the best dps.
---
Frost Mage is for me the better class for cc, as you can polymorph, nova, ice block if something goes wrong, ice barrier for a better survivability. Rogue can be useful for the sap, hunter for the frost trap... warlock rarely ban, but the can seduce with the succumbs if required (last resort)
---
But overall, you must have a good tank/healer. Vanilla can be very punishing if you take the aggro of the tank and if people don’t know how to focus... 
---
but if there are two hunters you can protect eachothers deadzones
---
Now I know where to go to camp your grey screen. Unless you role Horde then we will quest together.
---
That's an easy statement to make, can you provide any proof that it is not 100% accurate? 
---
And even if it is not, it is certainly better than 1.12 itemization, and the argument that blizzard doesn't have all the data isn't valid as it's simply changing some numbers not actually providing something new.
---
Same, started playing the same year I started learning English in school (9-10 years old), it's amazing how easy it is to learn languages when you are younger. I remember talking to people I was doing quests with in my broken fucking English but they still complimented me on it when I told them my age and nationality lol. 
---
Now, telling people that you're 10 years old in an online game... I never said I was a smart kid.

As a Bloodsail Buccaneer, the amount of mindless turning in cloth I did still haunts me to this day.

heres the thing: theyre not good for healing or abolish
---
i get flak for this opinion but i honestly think resto druids suck so much overall that its illogical to insist on every druid being resto
---
there have been almost no times in my life in which any vanilla guild ive ever been in has wanted to take more than one single druid, and even then, its almost always been just to have a motw bot. mages should be decursing immediately. paladins can cleanse and shamans can clear an entire group of poison at a time. every 
---
other class of healer regularly has higher output and almost all healing records so far on all bosses are claimed by paladins/priests, not druids. restos often are expected to give their innervates to priests, not themselves - which is saying something. the battle res isnt important if your guild does fights correctly, and so on
---
i would rather have a bear druid any day over a resto

Combat is good, not great. Its not a sandbox in the way skyrim is, but a deep story telling machine. Its lore and story are absolutely top notch imo, but if one does not feel the same i could understand not enjoying it.
---
It was never intended to be in the game.
---
I wouldn't mind if each region got one and then it was removed though as a fun little easter egg.
---
I know my typing to way better during vanilla. 
---
Yes but it was in the game files, and someone had it during Vanilla. Thats the whole point of wanting it in MC as an easter egg.
---
Progressive itemization would mean than that I would not only have to check whether a piece of  equipment is useful now, but also if it becomes useful with a patch?

Sounds like quite a hassle.

Yeah, I was a middle school kid when Classic was new. I’m almost 25. I’m more excited for a re-release of a 15 year old game than I am about almost any other game in the last few years. 
---
Hi, /u/888Kraken888
---
As others have said, dungeons are much looser in terms of spec because they aren't as difficult and the fights are shorter. You're also looking at places where CC matters more. If you're going to focus on that content, I'd look at the rarer builds to see if they appeal to you: ret paladin, balance druid, and elemental shaman all hold their own in dungeons and are fun because they're not as common. Shadow priests and feral DPS druids are not as rare in raid scenarios but they aren't common and they're fun in 5-man content.
---
Of course that is true, but trust me nostalrius had that "mainstream" feel to it aswell. My HS friend convinced me to play, then we convinced our best friend, and then as 3 we convinced a couple more to try it though it never really stuck.
---
The most likely reason it did not grip you after 9 hours is perhaps that you went into expecting different things. I went in myself expecting a more skyrim like experience, but Witcher has an entirely different focus - storytelling. 
---
You could ice block or I think a restoration potion will remove a harmful magic effect

This always baffles my mind, not being able to speak English in Europe doesn't just mean you can't communicate with the rest of the world, in most cases it means not being able to communicate with your neighboring countries.

Absolutely this! IQD dailies was like a carnival game run by a sadistic clown: at the end of this path is a pile of gold. All you have to do are these simple tasks hehe! Some days it was a quick hop to the gold promised. Other days it could start with a caster standing just outside of NPC aggro range messing with you and turn into a 20v20 cluster fuck that lasted 2 hours!

Outside of raiding / gold farming I really am kind of looking to be "that guy" that invades low level cities killing lowbies until they have guildies come and help and fight them too. I would like to have pretty good 1vX potential and am looking at hunter, rogue, and warlock. I haven't really enjoyed leveling a mage (highest I've gotten to is 35) but if they get more enjoyable later I'd be willing to push through with them too. Any ideas on what would be the best at that kind of wPvP?

Anyone who goes into Witcher expecting Skyrim is not gonna find it. Skyrim is a make your own adventure, witcher is an interactive story. I enjoyed both, many many hours in each, but in terms of quality i easily think Witcher &gt; Skyrim, to the point where Skyrim is like a puddle compared to the ocean that is Witcher 3 in terms of depth.

It also means that you get worse items in dungeons so you actually have some upgrades over time in raids instead of getting better than raid gear from dungeons because the dungeon loot was buffed later as a "catchup" mechanic. 
---
I honestly don't know what I was expecting. I knew nothing about it except a bit of gameplay footage and thinking the combat looked bad. Years later I gave it a try and this was my experience. The story seems great which is why I'll probably try again but it will be a push just so I can see the story development. The game part is what I didn't like. 
---
&gt; maybe even BWL was never cleared by a majority of players.
---
Considering that most players never raided at all that would be correct. There's a reason why ZG and AQ20 were introduced as 20 player raids, and 40 player raids discontinued altogether with TBC.
---
I can't find it right now but I've got the number of 10% of players with level 60 characters who raided in my head. 
---
allows more time for alts! The game should be about character progression, not chores! grinds are supposed to be difficult &amp; reward hardcore play. Dailies simply require "a minimum of X days in a row." It's nice to know that if you put the pedal to medal on a grind, you can get it done in a certain amount of time.
---
Damn, dead at 24 hours? I've gone 50+ hours playing wow...
---
Well said and a very interesting view
---
That was my experience on pservers as well. Even rogues seemed to be more in demand than mages.
---
The class doesnt really have any weak points. Strong at leveling, soloing, dungeons, raids, pvp, farming etc. So it's not surprising to see so many people choosing it.
---
You're probably right. I hate fighting paladins, I hate playing paladins, but having them buff me is pretty ok.
---
God I hated that daily so much. 
---
If you can tank, you won't be one of 1 million warriors; you'll have near instant group invites for any 5-man. From a time stand point Hunters provide more fun than warriors if you can't play lots every day since Warriors scale with their gear whereas Hunters can be fun at 60 with less than optimal gear.
---
FWIW, you don't need tailoring while leveling. You can pick it up at 60, get your robes and some bags, and then drop it.
---
If you do decide to go with Enchanting, you should take that from the start.
---
I'm likely going to be rolling a Priest and starting skinning for sure, and then either herbalism or enchanting. If I go enchanting, I'll drop skinning at 60 for tailoring and then eventually drop tailoring for herbalism. If I start off with herbalism and skinning, I'm not certain what I'll ultimately use as a second profession when I drop skinning, but I'm currently leaning toward the former approach.
---
It's worth noting that everyone should go Engineering, and the only logical exceptions are healers who go enchanting or alchemy. My thought though is I cna have an alt go alchemy, so it's less useful end game than enchanting.
---
It kinda balances out though. The things you sell and even the quests give a lot more gold. Just leveling my baby hunter up to 20 netted him 350g from 2 dungeons and auctioning mats/greens I found.
---
The catch-up items were introduced in patch 1.10. Those items won't be released until phase 5.
---
Other item changes were not intended as catch-up. Some were just mistakes that were fixed.
---
&gt; Ever heard of crushing blows and criticals? Druid has 1 way to deal with em 1 way only.  Dodge.
---
This...end of story.  Offtank and 5 mans is your bread and butter.
---
About 2 days played I'd reckon is the difference between slowest and fastest.
---
Mage &amp; hunter is fastest(mage is actually the fastest btw) and rogue and warrior the slowest( rogue is actually the slowest btw)
---
&gt;Ever heard of crushing blows and criticals? Druid has 1 way to deal with em 1 way only. Dodge.
---
This...end of story. Offtank and 5 mans is your bread and butter.
---
Yeah I legit do not remember doing any daily quest till maybe the ToC, and I must have done them the day they were out only, IIRC I could get the rep by doing dungeons with a tabar and that was enough.
---
I vaguely remember in MoP a lot of the content was daily gated, like a kind of garden (?). After the first patch that nerfed my spec pretty hard, I decided it was time to stop wow for the first time since vanilla.
---
This is actually what almost killed Path of Exile for me. I'm glad they killed off dailies in that game so I can have more choice in what I do with my hour of playtime.
---
Or frost mage fire mage warlock
---
Some pvp trinkets 
---
I agree. WIth no dailies you can easily log on to roam elwynn forest and saving poor warriors from dying to murlocs. You can fuck around much easier and have *fun* instead of feeling like you're wasting your time not doing dailies.
---
most of those dailies didn't exist for the bulk of tbc tho. 2.2 and 2.4 added many dailies
---
Fear:
---
Warrior has 2 abilities that remove fear, fear ward prevents it, there's a blacksmithing trinket that makes you immune for 30 seconds to fear, restorative potion will remove harmful magic effect. Some pvp trinkets can remove fear.
---
Charm: Some pvp trinkets can remove charm, a selfdot like skull of impending doom and I suppose restorative potion. 
---
If by noobs you mean flag carriers, then yes. 
---
Having one drop would be ok.
---
There are maybe 6-7% shamans on Horde and raids can take 20% Resto Shamans ;)
---
&gt; You need good gear to do well in PvP as a Shadow Priest.
---
Shadow Priests have one of the leanest gearing out of all caster classes next to SL Warlocks. They literally only need +spelldamage, stamina and some int. They need less/no +hit than other classes/specs and defnitely no +spellcrit. They can soak quite a bunch of damage if geared and specced smartly.
---
Many of their top tier PvP utilities are independand of gear as well: Dispell, Manaburn, Silence, Shadowweaving, improved Psychic Scream, Shield, perma slow from Mind Flay, Stun proccs from Blackout...
---
So I would say they are not at all gear dependand. In fact Shadow Priests are known for their power in openworld PvP because of that.
---
&gt; Dungeon's are the same way except you're not able to buff the damage for as many Warlocks so you're even more useless.
---
In 5man Dungeons Shadow Priests can heal just fine or DPS in shadow form. The reason they can't keep up with pure DPS in raids is simply mana problems which you don't really have in dungeons because you can sit between pulls. Actually their dungeon utility as a DPS is quite good because they can lessen the healing burden on their healer with shields and group wide regeneration.
---
Yeah that’s completely fair.
---
Tanks for dungeons are always need. The majority of the warrior you speak of will be DPS. Also at least a quarter or more of them will flake out due to leveling speed or realize how gear dependent and scaling of DPS wars are.
---
Hunter is the fastest to level however groups will be harder to come by as everyone prefers mages for sheep.
---
That being said play which ever you believe you will not regret. Bring the player not the class 
---
Yes, so much. I can't understand ppl asking for dailies in games, this is such a cancer model... 
---
Dailies were fine back in the day when they represented an *optional* grind for a non-progression reward, such as the TBC Drakes, or as a supplement to other means of rep grinds. But this current style of "content" man... I just can't deal. Especially now that all the rewards are RNG. 
---
I had been playing WoW for about 15 years with the exception of one year when I was abroad, but 4 straight weeks of grinding dailies for random items from loot boxes pushed me away for good. It was like having a second job, except instead of a paycheck I got a single pull on a slot machine each week, and another pull on the penny slots each day. No thanks. 
---
I'm soooo stoked for Classic.
---
I think it is interesting to see how he does on an official server. It will give us a good look on the sctual accuracy of private servers.
---
I did a fair amount of research on retail and on the Demo engine that Blizzard gave us. I simply wrote the same as above in my own words to make the concept understandable. 
---
The following is how GCD’s should work in Classic. 
---
Any weapon or item that is labeled as an “Off Hand” does not trigger a GCD upon equip.
---
    -this includes shields
---
Any weapon that is labeled as a “One-Hand” or “Two-Hand” triggers a GCD when equipped during combat. 
---
A GCD that is started by equipping a weapon during combat, causes no other weapons to be able equipped until the GCD has completed. 
---
If a spell or ability is used while in combat a GCD is triggered as always. However ANY WEAPON can be equipped during this GCD. 
---
The act of equipping the weapon disregards the ability/spell GCD and begins a new weapon based GCD during which no action can be taken. 
---
Any weapon swap can take place during a cast and causes no GCD.
---
The following is how GCD functions on the Demo Engine:
---
Weapon swap during cast is impossible
---
Offhand swap causes GCD
---
    -includes shields
---
If you use an instant ability such as Hamstring, and swap to an “offhand” or “one hand” during the GCD. The weapon is equipped instantly. 
---
This last one seemed very broken but was how the game responded. 
---
Going to do much more research but it’s High Time that a conversation gets going about this. We can’t let this slip through the cracks
---
I say just go for it.  It’s what you want to play, and you should t worry about a hypothetical population.  
---
levelled mage and rouge to 60 and can attest. 
---
While I didn't have luck with a signal booster, it sounds like you might since you have at least *some* baseline signal to boost. When I was testing it out it was very easy to walk around outside with the external anntenae and do tests. 
---
In other words, you could buy one of these and easily test it without having to do the install. If it doesn't work then return it. 
---
I'm 100% with you and had been bouncing back and forth for months trying to decide.  Watched every youtube class breakdown video i could find.
---
I recently came to the conclusion that i'll be maining a priest this time around. A few things that helped me make my decision.
---
1.  Do you have any friends coming back to level/play with regularly? If so, what are they playing and what role can you step into for questing, 5-mans, etc..  Also professions - if you play with a group of people and plan professions properly it can cut down on a ton of farming time later levels.   My friends coming back plan to roll mage, lock, hunter and warrior so all that's needed for a 5 man group is a healer.   No resurrect among those classes so eliminate druid. Shaman or priest came down to preferring shadow offspec to ele/enhance when not healing, and i feel really weird wearing cloth as a shaman.
---
2. Watch youtube videos of people leveling various classes in vanilla or on private servers. Not an exact replica of your gameplay of course but it can help with the feel/progression of each class a bit. I feel this helps more than the class guides i mentioned previously.
---
Best of luck!  i don't personally recommend the alt of every class route but odds are you find something you like fairly quickly while on that path and just stick with it anyways
---
I'm not talking about catch up items.
---
&gt;Other item changes were not intended as catch-up. Some were just mistakes that were fixed.
---
Whatever the intend was, they were significantly buffed which served to help people get gear faster thus catching up faster.
---
Examples: 
---
The entire deathbone set from scholomance went from garbage to having a million +def rating.
---
Gladiator chain vest went from a tank item to an amazing hunter and warrior chest. 
---
Ban'thok Sash went from being useless to being a belt that gives spellpower and the very only item to give spell hit
---
Brigam girdle went from being a mediocre item to being the an amazing warrior prebis belt.
---
Rosewine circle went from no stats to being a ring with 5mp5 and 29 healing, best in slot for a while.
---
Demonshear went from a shitty 2hander to the best 2hander until arcanite reaper.
---
It is undeniable that the itemization massively changes how people gear up and the power level of players in dungeon gear.
---
Netherwing, Ogri'la, Sunwell Offensive, Sky bird dudes. 
---
I didn't mind them since it was mostly for cosmetic stuff but the push for exalted was a bit grindy. 
---
Sadly it's really impossible to know. The best info we have is the [survey results on class](https://i.imgur.com/6B7MoNc.png), where 14% of players indicated they plan to main a mage, which would not be too bad.
---
The problem is that we don't know how representative this is of the people who'll actually end up playing classic.
---
Dailies in classic are farm tons of fucking herbs so you can raid.
---
Indeed! It was basically max level STV :D
---
Warrior. 
---
You don't sound hardcore so slow leveling is no problem aslong as you enjoy leveling. Being able to dps and tank gives playstyle viarity and fast groups while leveling. You are always wanted in 60- 5man dungeons. Meaning if you have a free night and want to do a dungeon, you can get in a group fast.
---
I always advise classes with multiple roles for those that havn't made up there mind because it always has multiple playstyles. 
---
And if you are bored with warrior after a while you can always "fast" level a hunter. 
---
Prot Warrior / Healer
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I leveled a warrior to 60 on Nostalrius but it shut down before I could see any of the raid content. Hunter would be much easier, but I just like the tanking.
---
Here's what I'm going to do: Roll an Orc Warrior, tank any non-raid content as fury building my own groups (that way I can ensure I'll get both the DPS and tank gear over time), then raid as fury / OT (I don't have enough time to be a MT). 
---
What about the 50% healing reduction from Blood Fury for Orcs?  I havent seen this mentioned?  Isnt this a huge negative?
---
That does sound nice and I do prefer the horde, but I also remember trying to level a shammy was a bitch when i tried it on private server.
---
But the *entire point* of skeleton keys is convenience, the convenience of not having to ask a rogue to open your lock. So if you have to ask a blacksmith to open your lock you've lost the entire purpose of the skeleton key.
---
The point of weapon chains is not the convenience, it's the effect, so even if you lose out on the small amount of convenience you would have if you were a Blacksmith you still have access to the majority of the point of the item.
---
Yup it sure is. I burnt out by level 47 in a private server :) but i think ill go for it to 60 this time around
---
Yeah, no useless dailies, no massive AP / azerite grinding. Classic can't come soon enough... 
---
I advise not playing WoW if you goal is to piss levelers off....buuttt if you intend on pissing people off, you already should know what the best class is
---
Yea, without dailies there are actually very few sources of liquid gold for a max level TBC player that doesn't have any quests left.
---
You can farm and cycle gold around on the AH but that removes 5% from the economy each time. And many specs aren't good at farming efficiently. If you don't have epic flying even gathering (mining/herb) is painful.
---
TBC dailies filled that gap and were there basically just for gold, so if you didn't need gold you simply didn't do them.
---
There was a guy in my TBC guild who was a Chinese national living in New Zealand that learned English primarily through playing WoW. I really miss everyone from that guild.
---
Mostly used for farming lashers in dme and demonic runes (if you have enough mana) in felwood. Rank 1 is great in PvP to interupt in ab and av, and to unstealth rogues. 
---
I have symmetrical gigabit at my apartment, you don't see me bragging.  See what I did there? 
---
Exactly this! Some specs are definately harder to pick up and try to compete with other classes. But the specs are there for a reason, they have a place. Traditional PvE isnt the only way to have fun! And I'm sure some dude is gonna take the challenge, make a video about it and have f. ex boomkin druid appeal to alot of people! Even elemental shaman in raids! 
---
Me: Hey, wanna play?
---
Her: Sure.
---
I stated WoW in March of 2016 and I had a similiar experience. Didn't really like retail, tried out Vanilla private servers and loved it!
---
&gt;Elder Scrolls Online

---
is this the game?
---
That bombing run was the worst, always someone else same or opposite faction bombing around the same time.  RARE was the time you could do the whole thing in one go but it was possible.
---
Yep, definitely.
---
For PVE
---
Go Warrior, 
---
Raids need 7-8 warriors and only 2 hunters are desirable.
---
For PVP
---
If you like group fighting, go warrior.
---
If you like defending flags, go hunter.
---
Eh...yes they were, in the heroics really did kill off a big part of vanilla. But on the other hand, the gameplay of TBC heroics was fucking epic. TBC was just such a different game, more focused on Blizz-driven content and less on player driven content, but man the Blizz-driven content was so good and there was so much of it.
---
Mages are the best class in vanilla.
---
Because pushing threat allows the dps to continue doing damage instead of stopping so they don't pull aggro and significantly shortens  the fight. 
---
 You can't predict a crit/crushing blow, you just prepare for the possibility of it by always keeping you tanks health bar full so a crit cannot kill them.
---
Being crit is not as big a deal as you think it is, and in Classic Warriors won't be sacrificing every single other that  to be defense capped like they were in Vanilla so everyone will be getting crit.
---
Another useful item: [Lei of Lillies.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=1315)
---
It's a BoE epic neck, and most people sell it cheap because the stats are kinda garbage (stam/spirit), but the Use effect is what you're after. It spawns a [Lily Root](http://classicdb.ch/?item=14894) that restores health/mana, and is not on the same cooldown as potions. (it shares the "secondary" cooldown with things like dark runes, healthstones, etc)
---
So basically you can use it to get a free small healing/mana item, that can be conjured every hour. Although yeah that's kinda the downside, is that it has an hour long CD, and the spawned item will disappear if you log out for more than 15 minutes.
---
Still somewhat useful for healers, as it provides a free mana-restoring item.
---
The problem was not, and has never been dailies. You could completely ignore the dailies in TBC, and WOTLK, and be just fine.
---
The problem has always been dailies that are mandatory for progression (MOP, WOD), or, even worse, never-ending dailies that remain mandatory for progression, long after you maxed out your reps. (Legion, BFA).
---
I got divorced.
---
My wife plays very casually and she’s by no means “a gamer.”  She likes pet battles, questing, etc.  it’s hard to say,  sometimes too just gotta be like “hey play this, see if you like it”
---
Im sure they will! May the elements be with you! 
---
They do have it. Watch 2018 Blizzcon and the patch stages we're  going by. 
---
As much as I agree with you, there may be some attrition of players after a few weeks so I wouldn’t worry *too* much.  Or it’ll be a massive success and you’ll be fighting for spots like me cause I plan on playing a mage as well ;)
---
But there's really not much point in going faster unless everyone else in the raid is also using that belt. You'll get ahead of everyone else....and then just have to wait for them anyway.
---
Do you have proof it is 100% accurate? 
---
Yep. This was me too. It didnt matter how repetitive the dailies were, but I had to get up and login to make sure I got all my dailies done. The worst thing was after getting my Netherdrake, I was so relieved that I was done with them, but I realized I never enjoyed them in the first place. I just did them because I was addicted
---
The only good that could come out of including a single drop of this item in Classic WoW is for everyone to enjoy the massive guild drama when the GL masterloots it to himself. Someone please record that on discord.
---
I wouldnt be surprised if they remade the classic cinematic honestly. I think thats the smart thing to do.
---
Was a lot easier when the game was fun
---
Doesnt seem to be working out that well tho lol
---
The topics are always on point with this podcast, super job!
---
Why do you like it ? Honest question, I'd like to understand. 
---
go druid they can tank heal and dps while lvling. they're fast asf at lvling and they have great pvp survivability. 
---
Just say this is something you’ve spent time with and care about - something you had fun with and made friendships through. Something that makes you work as a team and adapt. Something that’s fun and exploratory and immersive. And it’s something you’d like to do with her. If she doesn’t want to, you can’t force her. Gotta accept what she says either way. Cheers!
---
Gadgetzan AH alt got lost in the desert?
---
I got to around 40ish recently with a shammy on a private server and it wasn't too bad. As long as you take care to always get good 3+ sec speed 2h weps with windfury, levelling's not too slow.
---
This (doesn't) fuck(s)
---
Was 12 and learned english in this game, thotbott and screenshots was my friend for most of the quests
---
Now we have to postpone the 100th episode, so it lines nicely with the  Classic release. (:
---
When they stop saying boi.
---
Is a healing priest with pve raid gear usefull in pvp (BG), or will I just get bursted/stun locked all the time? I want to do raids but also be strong in pvp...
---
I have tried multiple times to get her to play wow. But she does not like the story. I had better luck getting her into swtor. 
---
Skinning is a shitty money-maker, doubly so if you are a shitty tank spec that can't grind efficiently.
---
'Even low-level items remain highly valuable'.
---
3g for a stack of a rare lvl20-30 herb is not highly valuable.
---
&gt; Selling instance runs or boosting friends' alts throughdungeons dungeons on condition you get anything they don't need.
---
People don't pay much for low-level dungeon runs (5g for a 30-minute low-level dungeon, including travel time...  Is shit money.)
---
People will let tanks reserve righteous orbs in strat live, but there's only so many groups in need of a tank for strat live at any point in time... And many of the ones who do need one would rather not pay the tank.
---
&gt; Guild group farming runs of instances, selling off things like BoE blues, gems, recipes etc and splitting the profits.
---
People don't group-farm instances for money, except for DM:N. But there's often demand for tanks for guild runs, so you can make a fair bit of money this way.
---
If you want to kill shit more efficiently, you can always respec as dps for a while. 
---
&gt; i mean they can do melee combat too right
---
They can and they're really good at PvP
---
I think if they do it at an event it would, but if they don't do the announcement at an event then probably not. It would be really cool though!
---
Yeet
---
I also recommend listening all the older episodes too, so much content and quality are put to those. Really interesting gem of interviews in there including former lead design Mark Kern for example, a must listen.
---
More attic junk
---
I hate dailies with a passion
---
Thats fine and all, some people just want to get shit done. This is respectable aswell. However, as I remember back in the days I would remember the names of good people I've encountered throughout Azeroth. I even heard of people before I saw them. They way servers work you are able to gain a reputation. If you gain the reputation of being a beast of a feral druid, ele shaman or boomkin the entry level gets lower. This is what I mean when I'm talking about being bold. Gain that reputation from showing that you know your shit even if you are an "underdog". 
---
Mage is fastest assuming you can aoe farm reliably, meaning not being contested on those high value spots. We'll see how that goes on launch lol vut definitely fast.
---
I mean, those aren't healers, but yes those do press a button a lot.
---
The quest for the teleporter doo-hickey is from sovik in the engineering house in org. Note that you have to at least pick up the other guy's quest (rig wars I think) in the same room to see sovik's yellow exclamation point. 
---
Did it this last weekend.
---
LOL I just saw this
---
It was Runescape + Vanilla that did the thing for me!
---
No one ever said it was a 100% accurate replica.  You got downvoted because you’re the type that has to point this out every time someone says anything regarding ps or repack..
---
If you seriously think that a 4 days 20 hours time from over a decade ago won’t be crushed just because ps have slightly wrong armor values on some mobs then you’re delusional.
---
No external supervision
---
The community needs to take care of itself 
---
I recall that guy always sitting outside the Orgrimmar AH with his High Warlord staff
---
You are ignoring my point, dude. Re-read my post if you want to engage. I'm asking why you care about this "worsens pre-existing condition" vs "causes addiction in a vacuum" distinction.
---
Good luck with your studies. I hope you question everything each teacher tells you every day. Institutions (of thought or otherwise) are far from infallible.
---
This has been a dream of mine for some time now, good luck on this mission! I’ve always dated girls that are just too cool for the fantasy realm let alone playing games like wow. It sounds like you have a solid platform for building your case as to why she may be interested though. Keep us updated 
---
I hate dailies but didn't mind the fishing ones either. 
---
FWIW, if you want to tank Engineering is better. blacksmithing is only better if you need to craft your own gear, or you get the pattern for Lionheart Helm. 
---
Thats good. There is just something about hitting an enemy with a melee weapon. Spell crits are nice too, but its not quite there for me.
---
Maybe shaman is the one for me after all.
---
French canadian heres, i live where no1 speak English at all, at work they call me to communicate in English or German to technician or salesman. I learned English by playing video game since the educational systems used to be so bad in quebec, back then your first English class was in 4th grade (10 year old).
---
Edit: horrible english due to horrible french mobile keyboard/autocorrect
---
He has a lot of shaman episodes but I’m most likely gonna main one so I’m happy:)
---
This podcast just cast bus shock and crit me HARD
---
No wow but I’ve convinced her to play Botw which is a good start 
---
4 hours assuming that it drops everytime, which it won't. Also wipes happen, so you'll want to bring a few spare ones just in case. 
---
It's just not worth the effort no matter how you spin it.
---
Asked my wife if she wanted to try it with me on one of those servers that shall not be named. Played together until about level 20 and she said she'd give it ago once the game releases. 
---
To be avoided or to be played?
---
Don't push it. Don't bombard her with info. Just ask if she wants to give it a shot, say it's something you both could do together and have fun with. And let her play. That's it, no rocket science. If she likes it, she does. If she doesn't, there's no use insisting.
---
In that case, you may wanna check out the War of the Ancients trilogy. Lots of lore on Night Elves and the Burning Legion, great for a setup for a possible night elf main.
---
You could also check out Warcraft Chronicles volumes 1 and 2. They elaborate on all of the lore from the beginning of time up until the events leading up to WoW’s launch. However, they are very recent books and rely entirely on retconned lore and stuff introduced in the MoP, WoD, and Legion expansions. Lore on the history of Pandaria; the true origins and nature of the Old Gods; the endgame of the Burning Legion; the prehistory of Draenor, the list goes on. If you prefer to keep things simple and relevant to Classic lore, you could consider avoiding these.
---
I'm not denying that it doesn't change gearing up. All I say is those changes were not intended as a catch-up.
---
In any case, I prefer #nochanges in this case. What you say makes sense, but if we go down that route, wouldn't we also have to introduce progressive talents, reduce the debuff limit, reimplement bugs? All those have much larger impact on raids than some healer having a nice ring. And as a bonus, fewer garbage items!
---
It's not like this means that you don't need to do dozens or hundreds of runs if you want to get all your pre-raid BiS. I really don't get the problem.
---
His content is good, the only off-putting thing about him is his voice

I'm in a similar boat, OP. Internet wasn't really a significant factor in where we bought property, though. That said, we called the local providers and Frontier assured us they had service here. When they came to set it up they realized that the road we live on has service, but our power and phone lines come from behind our property, not from the road, and they don't have service to those lines.
---
I can throw a rock and hit the frontier box from the end of my driveway, but they will not provide service to the houses connected to the lines we're off of. People say "oh they can probably set it up to your house, just ask" or "well X cable company just extended their service to cover a friend of mine in the same situation" but that isn't a guarantee and they have told us flat out "no, they have no plans of servicing this area in the forseeable future" and that's that.
---
Mobile data doesn't work where I live because our property is down in this little valley, this little black hole where cell service goes to die. We tried a jetpack, it worked great at first but over a few years service progressively deteriorated. Verizon bent over backwards trying to help us with new sim cards, re-activations, and even free hardware upgrades to try to resolve it. I'm betting tree growth slowly cut us off.
---
There are other internet options that might work for you but were not an option for us because they require a direct line of sight to a signal tower. There cannot be trees or structures blocking direct line of sight, though.
---
Ultimately we went with satellite internet. Hughesnet gives us roughly the same amount of data we were getting from Verizon plus 50 additional GB of data from 2-8 am (we're usually up by 4 am anyway) for about the same price we were paying Verizon, AND there are no overage fees. Even when throttled down after running out of data I can still Facebook, stream youtube at 480p or less, and play MMOs like WoW. It's not a viable option if you play FPS games, though, due to a permanent 700+ ms latency due to hardware limitations (beaming a signal to a satellite in orbit and back again isn't fast).
---
It isn't perfect, and people expecting Hughesnet to work just like their high speed Time Warner/Roadrunner connection did are in for a world of disappointment. I appreciate it for what it is--literally the only viable option I have, useable, and latency-friendly games like WoW are playable.
---
You have the burden of proof my friend.
---
Okay sure, let's say strictly the convenience is the point of the item. If you are a rogue or a good friend of a rogue keys then don't have any convenience... idk I don't think keys should really be on the list, since they are barely used and when used a rogue could have done the same thing. As someone who has played a lot of blacksmith and brother played rogue the times when he wasn't around having a key was convenient but not more convenient than shouting any rogue wanna make some money.
---
My biggest problem is the enchant of the weapon chain and the item the weapon chain are different. To use the item you have to have bs skill. To be enchanted you don't have to be. The number of times I've seen "LF blacksmith to put weapon chain/ shield spike/mithril spurs on me" it's absurd. Because you need a bs to get any use of the item. Once it's enchanted yeah you don't need a bs anymore but it isn't an item anymore. 
---
Wasn't that bad as a Resto shaman. Most of the gear is just as good for elemental as it is for Resto. It's slower for sure but it's by no means terrible.

[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_2.0.10](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.10)
---
Don't get me wrong people are in for a hard shock when all the private server warriors realize that 1.12 doesn't have the 2.0.1 normalized rage generation - especially off warriors will be rage starved massively because of that.
---
But a druid can not compete with an equally geared and equally well played def tank.
---
True of course. Mage is a lot harder to make work and also has higher skillcap, but I think world first 60 will be a mage.
---
I don't generally think fire would have enough damage to kill most mobs before they get up in your face without crits. Thus I said you have to crit them. 
---
4 hours is not much? 
---
Maybe if all you do is farm and raid or have no life at all...
---
I’m doing the same as you, only as a Tauren. If a casual guild needs a MT that only plays 2-3 days a week, I’m game, otherwise I’ll go Fury/Prot and OT if needed. 
---
Imo at the amount of hype going on here I can't help but feel farming for consumables won't be that boring. Say an enemy player shows up, this is no longer farming, it's a competition, it's engaging. Sure it will be somewhat slower, but it's based on fun yeah? I feel bad for people if they won't enjoy anything else than raiding. 
---
Yes, dailies were the addictive thing 
---
Too much spoilers then xD 
---
I see, in what way? Honestly i feel you are ignoring mind. It happens. 
---
I care about that distinction because of the negative impacts it is gonna have - people will misunderstand the source of their compulsion disorders, and the ignorant will seek to use gaming as a scape-goat for all manners of matters that it has nothing to do with. There are plenty of tabloid headlines heralding games as the latest heroin.
---
No i really don't. Pirate servers who try to give authentic experience of someone elses product have the burden of proof.
---
The problem is the ease at which people get gear the ease at which people can clear raids with stronger gear (already made stronger by 1.12 talents and what not), and how stronger dungeon gear means items from raids become less valuable. 
---
After becoming Crusader in Wrath, fuck dailies. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to be chain running for Baron's mount from now until the servers end.
---
Thank you kindly &lt;3
---
Healing and Tanking are both much more exciting and skill expressive than dealing damage because you literally just press buttons in a predefined sequence.
---
Healing in raids is more about multitasking, mana management and about predicting damage spikes. You have to be aware of your surroundings and the encounter, the rythm etc. to make the best predictions.
---
People who find healing boring just don't try to be the best healers they can be or they simply use semi-cheats like healbot.
---
We also have a friend who was a lineman for Frontier. He told us the same thing, getting service down the lines to our house would probably be inexpensive. He's serviced the area before and doesn't understand why they won't do it, but Frontier patently refuses to extend service to the properties that shoot off the main line.
---
I forgot to mention, I do not want to tank, I've tried it and found it too stressful for me.
---
Okay how do you suggest that one prove something is completely authentic ? 
---
Show them the Hunter class and Petopia website.

Ya I definitely agree with this, if she does give it a shot I'll tell her what she asks me about or just the basics of how to play, but other than that she should play however she wants. There's really no wrong way to play classic wow and it's best to let people discover it for themselves.
---
That's evil :D  But then if the shaman is serious he use some consume and still nuke you. That's why you need 2 buddies :)
---
Too bad this fellow had a bad experience. However as I stated in another comment, make it your business to be portrayed as a good player. 
---
I can relate. I knew nothing myself, but i did play skyrim, so thats where my expectations naturally came from. Perhaps some mods might serve you well? There are a number of them that spice up combat or take away some of the tedium, like sharpening your weapons, making oil, getting good gear etc. (They all genuinely do add to the epic feeling of the game, but it is certainly fair to do so if you please)
---
Basically my experience.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#coZViohthtI0mVoh
---
Here is what you can use if you lack hit. A few of the points are flexible depending if you want to grab some PvP stuff along the way. If you have hit, just remove the hit talent and grab more imp hawk. 
---
Yes i can see that happen, we'll see.
---
Yeah, on your shitty private server maybe, but not in Vanilla or Classic. Why would three bind on pickup items with no level requirement (clear indicators that they're quest rewards), that are all called Hakkari something (a Troll tribe) randomly drop from regular lockboxes or slimes? They don't is the answer. Drops from containers have always been notoriously inaccurate on private servers.

---
They are contained in a quest reward box from a quest in Sunken Temple, an instance which, oh wonder, is completely full of Troll enemies of the Hakkari tribe. Good luck if you wanna get these items from somewhere else, you're gonna need it lol
---
I'm too obsessed with wanting to roll on rare enchanting recipes, but too courteous to need-roll on something I cannot learn on the spot.
---
I loathe when people roll 'need' because they "plan on dropping X to go Y at 60". 
---
Tailoring for bags equals more loot. Enchanting for wands/cloth hopefully raises my damage and shortens kill time, increasing farm efficiency. 
---
We shall see...
---
Everyone has their own reasons for being excited for classic. In my case, it's seeing the old zones again after all this time, and hearing those old familiar tunes in places where they used to be (like the Plains music in Mulgore, for example). 
---
There's more than just that of course, but it's definitely something that's going to cause a massive nostalgia overload.
---
For priests, don't forget dispel or purify or w/e it is to remove magic debuffs from allies.
---
Other than having a good amount of NR that will mo impact on your ability to clear AQ40, the items is not even that good. May as well let 1 drop per server for fun.
---
Well, there have been a lot of runs before touted as "new WRs" that had the increased TBC exp values, so it's not exactly a fringe idea that we just can't rely on Pservers. If it's on a pserver, it can't be a world record.
---
The point remains correct. It's not even remotely controversial. "Blizz-like" is an aspiration and no one but people here deny that emulation without any access to the server side is a difficult task that must involve a lot of guess work. Not just armor values, the whole lot of mobs spawning, drop rates, aggro ranges, mob AI, how spell works, etc. The most accuracy pservers have is in raids where the encounters have been analyzed to death and we have video footage, combat logs, some of them even useful (i.e. dated). 
---
And no, I don't think that the WR won't be crushed. I'm just a little wary that someone returning after 13 years breaks his own best by 22 hours *on his first try*. If that doesn't raise your eyebrow even slightly, maybe you are the delusional one.
---
Tell that to Thrall
---
I love pally from an RP perspective, but i traditionally carry my group a bit from a dps perspective, and I've been worried that if i went Ret I'd go from pulling them up to dragging them down, which I'd feel bad about. Pally would also allow me to tank or heal if necessary too. Probaby the right way to go, but i'm not excited about leveling ret haha.
---
I'd love to MT but I just don't have the time anymore. It's not just being 99% available for at least two raid evenings a week, but farming consumables / gold as prot is just too time consuming. I reckon it's easier on time to just go fury as farming is easier and it's not a big deal to miss raids once in a while.
---
You’ll miss shadow word: death too 
---
Look up Kargoz’s in depth shaman guide, lots of good pointers and leveling tips/talents. 
---
Take shield prof instead of mana (it’s a tiny amount until you scale with gear) and always keep a shield/1h to swap into, even if you’re best weapon is a 2h at that time. This should help you in a few ways- warrior/rogue/hunter ganks, accidentally pulling aggro in a dungeon, weaponswap into your windfury prepped 2h for a StormStrike and swap back, etc.
---
I personally loved leveling 1h/shield and flametongue with imp lightning shield, throw your searing or a nova down and auto away. More consistent leveling speed but your mileage may vary.
---
Shaman isn’t too difficult and I had a ton of fun getting to 60 on mine! Always nice to have healing gear on deck for quick dungeon groups; Fuck that water totem quest tho.. 
---
Did you miss the part of that presentation where they explicitly stated they do not have all the data for non 1.12 patches?
---
&gt; since it was mostly for cosmetic stuff
---
I think that must be why I never even bothered to look at these things at the time. My play time was limited and I was focusing on arenas and dungeons
---
Pathing is one thing I'm really curious about. Farming DM:W as a Warlock involved heavy use of how mobs pathed up &amp; down the ramp to the first boss when you jump on and off the raised sides. With Classic being built off of a modification of the current engine, part of me keeps wondering if I'm going to get slapped by a pack of treants walking straight to me the first time I try it.
---
I did it too. It’s what really put me off. I was just doing it for the sake of it - absolutely no enjoyment at all 
---
damn, really? they must've really upped the gold amounts + i will admit i don't usually ah things while leveling, which i'm sure contributes. i'm glad to hear that!
---
Yeah only in ENDGAME raids with close to bis gear buddy!
---
Yeah yeah, can you put down the windfury totem now? We're about to attack the boss 
---
Inb4 a hunter smashes everyone
---
I think most people know about the extreme cases, the media sure like those news.
---
Yeah, that’s why one of the first things I’m going to do is level a hunter with herbalism/alchemy. I don’t plan on pulling Black Lotus, but being able to farm gold and transmute Arcanite will be huge for me. I want a Lionheart Helm and Force Reactive Disk as quickly as possible, and mats for health pots, rage pots, elixirs, etc. will be huge. 
---
I'm gonna miss Human Hunters. I know that it's kinda dumb but it's easily my favorite race/class combo.
---
Dailies are the worst thing one can imagine as a concept for this game. It turns the questing and grinding aspect into a sunk opportunity cost scenario. As one comment or said above, their coworker had “to go home and do their dailies” transforms the act of playing the game into a chore. 
---
This is completely different from simple grinding in two ways: First, if I grind for loot I can do it as little or as much as I choose, regardless of what day it is. If I want to sink ten hours a week grinding for Ironfoe that’s on me. However with dailies you have to check in every single day to do your quests, and it’s not about the search for a drop, or the role play experience, or just the reward of killing so and so in the world. 
---
Secondly, it turns questing into a straight math and opportunity costs scenario, in that now it’s simply “okay, I need one months worth of the quest for x item, then three weeks for y, and if I miss a weekend it delays my whole grind that many days.” There is no catch up, or get ahead mechanic, it’s just like doing chores because all the fun is gone. It doesn’t really matter WHAT the quest actually is, the content become irrelevant- now only the clock and the days matter. 
---
I would rather grind Baron Rivendare (sp?) or Ironfoe a billion times than do dailies because how they are experienced are completely different. Also the fact that there is no guarantees for Ironfoe to drop is actually a bonus here as it adds variety to the world, and nothing in life is guaranteed. Well, except dailies apparently- excuse me guys gotta go do my chores and take out the trash, I mean, do my dailies.........
---
Unless a warlock and a couple of buddies are wearing the belt. Then everyone can complain that the warlock didn't farm enough shards to summon all of their lazy asses.
---
That's impressive, even though it's not enough to be Armor capped against bosses, I believe. Since Bosses are considered level 63, the formula  DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 \* (AttackerLevel + 4.5 \* (AttackerLevel - 59))) gives, for a 75% damage reduction (cap), an armor of 21 090 (I might have done a mistake typing it on my calculator, but I think it's the good value). 
---
Against level 60s it's indeed 17 647 armor to be capped, so you got it.
---
However, there's no way you reach 18k armor without Greater Stoneshield Potion/ Pala buffs/ Others, though :o Even with BiS items it should be hard to get past 14k. Could you show us a screen of how much you got unbuffed ?  
---
But what is the problem when a raid can progress one weak earlier? It's not like content can be skipped or becomes trivialised.
---
The raid group that can kill Ragnaros and the one that can't aren't differentiated by one slightly better blue item per character.
---
So personal experience &gt; video proof from major live streamers. 
---
Yeah that sounds about par for the course here on reddit...
---
That is not my problem to solve. Either you have enough data to create authentic servive &amp; you know it or you don't. One thing is for sure, if any of the Pservers would really be super accurate they would shout it from the rooftops. Software &amp; reverese engineers know when they have done good job &amp; have enough data to say something id near original.
---
Whoa I guess ive been wrong the whole time! How could I have been so uninformed to know that druids are simply 100% on par with warrior tanks! I hope you roll a tank druid and come back to this post at 60. Clearly you are a BFA player or just never played Vanilla 
---
I thought you turned into a skeleton when you released spirit or is that only when you revive?? Nice screenshot 
---
Mage, fury warriors and rogue will be dime a dozen (though it might be argued that you need plenty of them but yeah, for loot, it will be hell)
---
Hunters population is hard to predict: hardcore players tend to avoid it but maybe more casual players will still pick them a lot as it’s always a popular class so... we will see
---
DPS Paladin/shaman/Druid/priest will have hard time to be taken seriously and only a few will manage to find a place in the sun
---
Warlocks can maybe be the smart choice for DPS (especially on alliance side.
---
Druid are likely to be the least played class so in demand even though you don’t need a lot of them.
---
Finally, healing priest, Paladin and shaman are likely to be those with the less difficult to find their spot
---
Please tell me you are trolling. Crushing blows and crits is something not even warriors care about, and they have much lower HP/Armor than Druids.
---
&gt; keks / burs while spamming 2500 threat battleshouts in a melee group every gcd 
---
Alright you are not trolling. You are just an idiot who dont fact check.
---
People also want to be able to raid, and with mages/rogues/warriors that can be a seriuos concern due to how many of them there are. 
---
So unless you're a really good player, it can be hard to get into a raiding guild if there's too much competition.
---
Oof, that's a long time. I was planning on that for my pre-raid BiS. Guess I'll go look at a guide. Thanks for the note.
---
I played skyrim a little bit, but wow I've never tried forcing myself to like a game as much as I did with skyrim lol. Steam says I have 101 hours in Skyrim and I never got past a quarter of the story I'd guess. Most of the time is spent on the guilds sidequests and starting characters over year after year haha.
---
&gt;Perhaps some mods might serve you well?
---
Not a bad idea! I usually have no interest in mods, but for the sake of enjoying the story more I might do this. 
---
Gold farmed from instances only inflates the economy as a whole. It requires no outside world interaction or pvp, and therefore is easier, faster, and more bot-friendly. Now that stuff has been min-maxed to death, gph from instances has become insane private servers. If Activision leaves it as it is, we all will feel it.
---
Dwarf holy priest, holy paladin on alliance will get you into almost any group
---
Yeah, it's pretty nuts. Just sell everything you find. No point in equipping greens that you can sell for 60g when you'll be 5 levels higher in half an hour.
---
I'm 27 and stopped playing literally the day the pre-Cata patch came live and trashed the world. Haven't played since. I'm too excited. I played from Vanilla thru WOTLK.
---
Prot Warrior or any healer. 
---
I am a native born English speaker, so WoW did not teach me how to speak English, but, I can attest that playing WoW finally taught me how to type without looking at the keyboard. Any KKona brothers with me in that? 
---
That's one of them. Nefarian class calls are another. There are a few others where I drop Tremor Totem + Fire Resist Totem instead of my usual Strength of Earth + Mana Spring Totem, but for the most part, I just target a tank and press Rank 1 Chain Heal.
---
Downvoted for telling the truth though.
---
These are some great points, I think what could be the main hook for her are the community aspects. If I can get her to try it just long enough to do a group quest and even join a guild she will probably be more likely to keep trying.
---
I gotcha, just wanted to bring up the option. Never know what people will enjoy.
---
This. If she wants to play with you, you also have to make sure your goal is not to play the game for you, but rather use it as a way to spend time with her. If she wants you two to grind leather for 15 minutes to get her a pair of white bracers, you grind that leather, even if you know it would be much more efficient to just keep questing. I hope you got a feel for your girl on how far you have to bring this. My girlfriend likes to know what she should do, so she wants me to show her the "best" paths in games we play (emphasis here on that she asks), but she gets really frustrated if I rush things and she can't keep up. She hates it when I am higher level for example, so I try to stay at least a few bars behind so she doesn't feel stressed out.
---
That is a pretty handy one, but I tried to keep BoE's off the list because the chance is what makes them iffy to grab. 
---
If it was just useful items without the ease stipulation then I'd totally add that in 
---
the class you want to play will be desired/wanted
---
Holy priest. Big reason for druids in raids is to Innervate a healer.
---
Heh perhaps you are just not much of an RPG guy? Don't have to be. Even vanilla is only half RPG, and maybe thats more to your liking. Skyrim is as much fun as you make it imo.
---
Go for it! Mods are meant to customize your experience to suit your wants, so i do think it might go a long way to letting you enjoy the game. Sounds like you realize it has great potential but somethings holding you back. Remove that and you might just enjoy it as much as us big fanbois.
---
omg totally forgot about that but ur right 
---
tho ive been playing games since i was 3 years old, wow really helped me understand english a lot better
---
Play mage
---
Farming up until AQ40 is a breeze. You only need about 50-100g worth of consumes in BWL, so its easily done in an hour or two.
---
But in the later part of AQ40 and especially in Naxxramas consumable usage really gets out of hand out of necessity. Loatheb, Sapphiron, C'thun in AQ40 just need a shitton of protection potions and it really can wear on you. Even more so on classes that need double the consumes to start to barely scratch the lower ranks of the DPS charts.
---
that's a good point tbh. it's been a while but i seem to remember greens not dropping for me as often, tho i admit that's bc i mostly did pvp and some dungeons towards the end, i bet somebody doing a ton of questing and dungeons would be rolling in it
---
Learn english but always remember where you come from... 
---
For some people, In here learning english is like being assimilated... and quebec has a big history of resisting the english invader haha.. so that may explain why some people are reticent in learning english.. but it severely impacts the amount of jobs you can do.. and to be frank its almost impossible to work here without knowing at least a VERY basic english.. since most things are now written in english
---
Mained priest through vanilla raids up through AQ and find it more interesting to me than dps. You can think of it the same as dps only your enemy is your teams health bar. You will have 40 people to throw lh/gh and hots on as well as dispelling if you are on that duty. DPS targets the boss/adds and goes through their rotation and manages their fury/energy/mana. You will have to manage all of the same things as the dps as well as trying to predict the damage spikes that tanks will take, healers will gain some aggro as well as bad dps(or dps looking over healers) will get aggro and you will have to either predict it or let some die. Love healing
---
This. Stratholme living is a gold mine if you can reserve them orbs.
---
Yes this will be the case in Classic as well. 
---
You're not going to get the same feeling 
---
You were young
---
Internet was fairly new
---
Everything in the game was new and unexplored
---
I'd say the genre, mmorpg genre itself is dying but classic will initially be a success but around bwl we'll definitely see stagnation followed with sharp drop in active players, if not earlier
---
People today want immediate rewards and constant gratification, that's why so many games have achievement system in them 
---
Not to mention community centered game will not be a option since everyone gets offended by everything today and blizzard has decided to moderate it and it's not really fun to play with people who get offended by slightest stuff and you need to tiptoe around them
---
WoW did not, as I wasn't playing it when I was still learning English. Videogames in general did though. Working through games like super mario or final fantasy while in very broken english trying to figure out what every option did was the best for my development of the language!
---
On our drivers plates is written Je Me Souviens... for I Remember.. where we come from.. european France la mère patrie
---
Couldn't agree more. Retails "log in to complete x, y, z so you don't lose reward a, b, c" daily/weekly systems are a total slog. They're nice to have for the first few weeks of an expansion, but then the constant repetition just kills the game for me.
---
In classic I logged on to see what people in the guild were up to, would join in a run or a 20 man raid on off days. If no one was doing anything specific I'd go farm. I kind of MISS FARMING JUST TO FARM. Now, if I just go farm somewhere I feel like I'm wasting my time, if there isn't a world quest bonus or something I'm completing.
---
Exactly. It became pure torture, and if you missed a day, that's another day more until you could be officially done with it... on one character.
---
Honestly, if you want to have the biggest impact on helping your friends progress, you want to be tank or healer, not DPS. 
---
See I've been lucky and pretty much exclusively dated dorky girls. It's wonderful, I can just talk about whatever I want to talk about :p one day I ended up spending like a couple hours with her in the park just talking about the warcraft 3 story, and she just kept listening because she was so interested haha
---
God forbid people who put in time get rewarded more than people who don't...
---
It's the entire reason this game is appealing to so many people.  You get out what you put in.
---
Fear is not the reason why Mages are countered by warlocks and Spriests. A good warlock will never try to fear a Mage. And you don’t use a succubus against a Mage either because that’s a certain loss. 
---
&gt;I'm not lying, every raid there was AT LEAST 8-10 mages.
---
Well you want *at least* 8-10 mages in every raid. So that's hardly surprising. 
---
Usually things work themselves out. There are more mages, warriors, and rogues, but raids also want more mages, warriors, and rogues. And while there are less warlocks and hunters, raids don't want as many of those classes. 
---
For dungeons only warriors have an easier time gearing up than mages, out of the dps classes, but they will have to tank. Rogues for example have a much tougher time finding dungeon groups than mages (every group wants a mage, but no one gives a shit about rogues, they are just filler). 
---
About the only form of policing that is needed is a moratorium on name, race, faction, and server changes. Who you are in game is who you are, forever. There was a troll on my server back in the day who was on ignore by just about everybody. Eventually he was just screaming into the void, alone. No need to ban him; just prevent him from changing his mask.
---
Great in 1v1 pvp. Goes oom fast. Not desirable in raids 
---
I always liked the idea of a paladin, but the class itself never worked for me. If you're worried about filling a gap that your friends are dropping, I'd suggest the other uncommon options. Druid lets you do DPS, heals, and tanking as well, but it tends to be better than a paladin at all of them (in my opinion). Shadow priest and elemental shaman are both better DPS than ret paladin and can fill a good healing role if you ever need to switch.
---
Blizzard is not creative enough for that. Leave it to the private servers. 
---
When Sims 1 was released my father got it for us, in English. Took a few months but we knew soo much English after that. Was a perfect game to learn.
---
Me: "How about we play wow classic together?"
---
She: "Who will take care of your son while we play?"
---
Me: "Yeah.. you are the best wife under the Sun"
---
I understand that it's not a huge thing yes. It won't make or break guilds/raids. But it is important enough for blizzard to make a quick swoop in and fix things.
---
not sure what any of that means but any setup will do for 5mans
---
&gt; pserver 
---
Your first mistake
---
Elemental Shamans are very strong in 5 mans but utterly useless in raids. 
---
Warrior hunter and rogue are fun. Warrior is everyone's favorite.
---
They’re not the best DPS, but Hunter rotation is quite fun, mostly because it changes based on the attack speed of your weapon, and you get to stutter step between shots. 
---
Played in a 99,9% Swedish guild. We had 1 guy from the Netherlands. He picked up quite a lot of Swedish after 2 years :D
---
Warlocks were rare :(
---
I didn't really have a concept of ranking at the time. He just seemed to be on when I was.
---
I had Lionheart before I even hit 60 on Nostalrius (cost me my epic mount though). Alchemy / Herbalism worked really well in terms of making profit / transmuting arcanite ... but bear in mind the server already had a very established economy by that point. Also: Force Reactive Disk and Lionheart Helm plans are really rare so it might take a while for them to drop (if they're even in the loot table on release? not sure). So don't stress yourself :-)
---
This is just my experience with pservers, so take it with a grain of salt.
---
While there are a lot of warriors, a lot of them will never make it to 60 and those that do will give up once they realize just how much farming you need to do to be competitive, plus it's the worst farming class. 
---
Good fury warriors are hard to come by, especially if you're trying to stack them. 
---
Rogues are only popular on pvp servers imo.
---
It's a common knowledge by now that healers have the easiest time to get into raids, to the point that too many people are going heals. 
---
And with the new strats you don't even need that many, so you end up with an over abundance of healers.
---
My experience was different. I spent a month studying in Bordeaux after ~7 months of 8 hour days learning French at DLI. Any time that I was speaking with the locals, I'd absolutely give my all at getting through the conversation entirely in French, but on several occassions a shopkeeper, waitress, or museum guide would switch over to English for me if it became apparent that I was struggling to get a word/idea across.
---
The biggest thing for the French is that you *try*. Assuming that they'll respond in English is pretty rude, imo - you're in *their* country, so it's important to try and speak *their* language. 
---
"non bending elitists"?? I see you. Please join my dream guild, "Order of the White Lotus"
---
Or, get the fastest dagger possible and use flametongue. They get about the same DPS (with a white dagger).
---
I never said 100% on par. They dont have Shield Wall, so tanking Maexxna, Chromaggus etc will not be advisable.
---
That being said, if you refuse to inform yourself on how the game works with all the available information in the world, there's nothing I can say that will help you. Ignorance is a choice. It's that simple.
---
&gt; Let me guess you watched some druid in bis naxx gear offtank stuff in raids on youtube private server? :D 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/6cRP6mJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6cRP6mJ.jpg)
---
This is me. I know what I am talking about and I have the experience to back it up. Can you say the same, or are you just copy pasting some misinformation from a 13 year old forum post?
---
If you are trying to imply that somehow after spending 13 years trying to closely emulate private servers, we ended up with a game where Druids can tank almost every boss in the game perfectly fine when they somehow wasnt able to do so in the real? You have to be a complete idiot to believe that.
---
I did dailies like 5 times maybe before I realized the game sucks now. 
---
Shortly after moving in together, I showed my (now ex) wife WoW and helped her make a character. The next day, we bought a new comp, desk and chair. It was glorious... until I became her alt dungeon running slave, quest helper, and raidbot. It was miserable and made me hate playing for years.
---
Not saying you're going to have the same results, but be warned. Sometimes it's better to have your own activities instead of being joined at the hip.
---
All the best to you and hopefully it turns out well if you get her converted.
---
I always enjoyed my corruption lock. Even if it isn't top tier dps. 
---
Yeah, Lionheart Helm drops from raid bosses, so it might be a bit. 
---
I definitely think she should play the game however she wants. If she asks me about some things, I'll tell her, and I'll probably tell her the basics of each race and class, but other than that I'll let her organically play the way we all did back in the day. 
---
I do want to power level a mage so if she does play I'll make a druid alt to level with her. Druid because no matter what I can heal/tank if situations start to get out of control. 
---
Yes
---
This. I still remember when they nerfed SM and farming library as a rogue. They nerfed the vendor value on the blue items. 
---
*-Enters STV from Duskwood-*
---
* [Rogue's Ambush strikes you for 2830 damage.]
---
* [You have died.]
---
*-Goes out through Booty Bay entrance.-*
---
* [Hunter's Aimed Shot strikes you for 3002 damage.]
---
*-Gets pissed and swims to the back of Gurubashi Arena, thinking stealth is boss.-*
---
* You aggro a wild rare elite level "??" along with a plethora of other mobs, instantly killing you.
---
Better alt-F4. Yep, that's enough ST:Vietnam for today.
---
Doesn't matter, if you're a healer you'll find a group and a guild 
---
Except that tbc values for quests beyond a certain level was already known and fixed prior to his run on repack at 3 days 22 hours. You also act like this guy has not played WoW at all in 13 years. This is his first run of 1-60 in a while, yes, but to my knowledge he’s been testing things on ps to work on his guide for a while now. Why are you surprised that he made improvement on his time after 13 years of on/off researching routes etc? You’re also forgetting that on a repack he’s playing completely solo (not competition for anything early on like you would see for a fresh launch)..
---
I also don’t like how people try to umbrella everything into “world record”. There’s a WR for vanilla; it’s Joanna’s run at 4d 20h. Vanilla is done, that record can never be changed. That doesn’t mean that there can’t be new WR for ps...
---
This was probably my favorite class &amp; spec to play, but wasnt really viable for a long time for raid DPS.
---
Ironically the classes with the most complicated rotations are also the ones doing the least DPS (Hunters, Ferals). Hunters are always wanted in a raid, however, at least a couple of them so that's probably a solid choice.
---
My favorite RPG has been Mass Effect 1-3 through the years. I played the trilogy completely through 3 times so far. I love that games storyline, and all the characters were super interesting.
---
Absolutely love Divinity series, morrowind and oblivion, pillars of eternity, Dragonage:origins, all the fallouts but FO4 the least, final fantasy, probably a lot more but those are the ones I do love off the top of my head.
---
I just didn't feel anything at all from skyrim. I felt a lot of potential from witcher like I said, but for whatever reason all the pieces didn't fit together right away for me. The moment I knew witcher had potential was the quest to investigate a banshee at a well, and you find it in the daytime etc and your bestiary explains the creature in detail and lets you know how to approach. Was a very cool thing for me. 
---
That's not at all what I'm saying.  People that put in more time *should* be rewarded more...that's foundational to the MMO genre.   What I'm saying is that people that put in more time *should not* be rewarded at a faster rate-per-time, which is what happens when *the most lucrative farming* isn't accessible to casuals.
---
I highly recommend playing Warcraft 3 before WoW, a lot of WoW is based on it. It's a bigger source of the background of  than any of the books.
---
Come check out the Hunter classic discord and ask any questions you have and we have plenty of people to answer em in depth
---
Here's the link: https://discord.gg/Zn9JB3u
---
Welcome to the dream-club. Especially when you're married.
---
So since i stopped playing 10 years ago, just before cata came out. Not sure how much of this would or wouldnt have happened if I would have kept on playing but I'll share anyway. 
---
I moved to a different continent, almost ended up homeless, got married to my wife &amp; started studying at University. Quite alot has happened in 10 years!
---
This is the classic wow sub so I assume he means classic, when it releases..
---
Just go alliance so I can get faster BG queue as horde :D
---
Honestly I would rather not have racial slurs being thrown around in trade chat, stuff like that really turns me off from a game. But as long as the filter catches it I am all for Blizzard letting us moderate our own game.
---
Oh shit sorry got them mixed up 
---
Witcher 3 is a long ass game. You can easily reach 100 hours played before even finishing the base game, let alone the expansions.
---
I find it bad design that in Classic leveling is extremely boring until 40 when I get to the last talent in the tree, and that takes a lot longer than 9 hours.
---
If you’re not into storytelling you’re gonna hate Witcher 3 and pretty much any RPG that focuses on it. You’re playing as an established character, so you can’t do whatever you want like in Skyrim. If you want to play but the combat bugs you get the Combat Enhancement mod. 
---
Is that the one with Grom escaping the concentration camps and grabbing a broadsword by the blade with his hands?
---
Just be the best mage
---
Then just play WC3...
---
Unfortunately true. I'm not sure how different destro would be in classic vs wrath (which I also played a destro lock in raids). I'd have to look at the old talent tree again.
---
I do it all the time, I do agree with your original comment though lol 
---
It's good for WC2, maybe not WC3 though.
---
I'm doing Daily quests in Tera Online right now and while it felt bad at first I've slowly accepted that the grind is real and to just enjoy it even if I never get the best gear. I play when I'm bored and stop before I get sick of it. 
---
Back when during the WoW dailys it just felt so much worse than this. 
---
Like, in Tera the daily stuff is just for when you need a break from dungeon farming and gives the same rewards as dungeons at a greatly reduced rate and not all of them.
---
Don't get me wrong, Tera had grind. It feels like I'm walking across Texas and instead of imaging the ocean I have to just keep my eyes focused on what's close by. With that said the WoW daily questsadd me feel pathetic. 
---
Like you I was super addicted to World of Warcraft. Back then I was a teen who wasn't allowed to date. I wasn't allowed to drive. If I were to work I'd have had to travel 2 hours a day and give you half my pay to parents, and always be sleep deprived. My parents were growing apart and us kids always felt the seperated we inevitable. The divorce still crushed me hard though. 
---
The alternative to that work arrangement news to to not do anything. And because I resentednmt parents for being controlling and denying me freedom that all the other kids had.... even the freedom to expr as my frustration was forbidden... I just escaped. I played Vanilla starting about 4 months before BC then kept paying till end of Wrath. 
---
At one period of time we Still had Internet but my parents couldn't afford the WoW sub so I got Guild Wars original for my b-day. 
---
So I always wanted some escape.in WoW I ganked the shit out of lowbies for awhile because I wanted to identify with somebody who felt like me. 
---
Eventually though I realized how mad I was making people so I stopped ganking except for when somebody tried to kill me. 
---
Anyways back to the daily WoW quests.... It felt so hollow and fake. It was the fakest shit I'd ever seen. 
---
I lost a lot of respect for Blizzard when they did that. Instead of making real content or creating incentive to craft they gave us that fuckimg Island. 
---
And really Rift and Tera along with nearly every other MMORPG followed suite years later. 
---
I guess I'm biggoted against Enmasse Entertainment because I have low expectations of them. I still compare other companies to Blizzard while saying "oh well we can't expect them to bail it like Blizz did".
---
And at the same time I think Tera is better than Retail WoW in many ways. Idk... Isle of Kewl Dino's or whatever the fuck it's called was such a dissapointment. 
---
Also the fact that it took them years to do a graphics update on WoW. It's like the guy who invented the toaster making an2.9 version with a glossier finish and going up to Elon musk like "aren't you proud of my toaster?"
---
Fucking no I'm not! Make a better toaster. It should be at least 3x that shiny.
---
Yeah, definitely worth pointing out. It's always better to play a class you'll enjoy. 
---
A lot of different reasons. 
---
Doing quests is fun. Dailies always gave me a sense of satisfaction and completion.
---
Also, my schedule for a lot of my WoW career lended itself to only playing 45 minutes a day, so dailies helped me feel like I was still progressing on my character even though I could never play for hours at a time.
---
I don't play retail anymore, but when Classic comes I'll take advantage of the double subscription to occasionally hop on my main and work on BC/LK rep and loremaster. I'm halfway to exalted with Ogri'la and looking forward to finishing my last BC rep!
---
ISLE OF QUEL’ DANS- I NEED MY GOLD
---
Ten minutes of private server World chat was enough for me to fully support moderation of chat channels. I go to games to escape politics, not to discuss them. 
---
I take issue with the automated "customer service" options like right-click-report for the following reasons:
---
* I'm not convinced the thresholds are set appropriately high enough for a massively multiplayer game. Granted my opinion is based on when I still played and a guild offering *free* Moose Mount achievement carries was auto-silenced by a rival guild trying to *sell* carries, but the fact that this could even happen tells me the threshold for automatic action was not high enough.
---
* As far as I understand, Blizz cannot actually see who right click reports. Your name and account info are not attached to the report. So if you and your friends right click report somebody for stating they voted for \*insert the "wrong" candidate here\* in a recent election or a group of players undercutting your side business, Blizz cannot identify you and cannot action you appropriately for your blatant and wonton abuse of the report system to harass and troll other players.
---
* A simple right click is a simple, thoughtless action. The ticket system at least makes you pause to consider if you are outraged enough to stop what you are doing in order to fill out the ticket and describe your grievance. If it isn't worth stopping what you are doing for just a few minutes, it isn't worth reporting at all in my opinion. Right click reporting removes that consideration from the equation entirely and people might potentially be actioned for shit people don't *really* care about.
---
Unless some huge changes have been made/will be made to this system, I think it should be left out. I would almost prefer utter lawlessness and wild west where we police ourselves via exclusion and ostracizing of problem players and using the old-fashioned ignore list. I take issue with people who say deliberately offensive things, deliberately intending to provoke a response with deliberately incendiary statements who turn around and whine "but muh freeze peach grow a thicker skin!". But honestly I'd rather put up with that than risk people getting banned for stupid knee-jerk impulsive reactions to "he said something I don't like  and I don't believe in using my ignore list".
---
What exactly is the issue with K3 its still going strong, I haven't heard a single complaint in the last year. 
---
Yeah once you realize you're grinding stuff out of some sort of feeling of obligation rather than because it's something you want to do... Also for me, the reality of the gear treadmill in WOTLK was the nail in the coffin.  I came back and got to 85 on my druid and rogue when Cataclysm dropped but it was extremely forgettable and I wasn't really having any fun.  I think I did 1 run of a dungeon at 85, logged out and never felt like logging in again.  So I didn't.
---
Having played through most expansions, Cata is by far the most vilified, and under-rated expansion. Cata was amazing during the first two tiers. It was really just the shitstorm that was the dragonsoul patch which ruined the entire expansion. 
---
This wouldn't work very well with my gf. She would feel behind because I had a main, and only playing with her as a "side-thing". In our case, she is totally ok with playing on her own though since we leveled to 50 on a pserver a year or so back, and she have been a gamer for the past 6-7 or so years (like 2-3k hours League of Legends I think, mostly solo), so I don't have to "nurture" her when classic is released for her to have fun.
---
But looking back to when we met, about 5 years ago, I would absolutely have to spend a lot of energy, and probably cripple my own experience to keep her interested for long enough to become self-going.
---
I'd rather play with a fun ret pally than an elitist warrior. I may be perpetually behind 1 tier but having fun with cool people is more important that world firsts. 
---
Yeah, questing while waiting on dungeon queues is arguably the fastest way to level and it seems to generate a LOT of mats/greens. Being able to upgrade from 6-8 slot bags to 16-18 slot bags by level 20 is pretty grand.
---
Those tabloids are 1000% right to do so imo. Setting aside the mechanism for a moment (please let's set it aside), "play very compelling video game with every waking moment -&gt; life shit-spirals" is a thing I have seen over and over and over again. I don't know what words you would be happy with me using but according to language as it is used in the world, that is an addictive, habit-forming, damaging brain drug.
---
Anyway, this is exhausting, I'm gonna stop replying. Thanks for being so civil and sorry about my snappiness.
---
Can't play mages/rogues/warriors due to overpopulation. Can't play druid/paladin/shaman for DPS due to better options being available.
---
So I guess that means the only viable DPS is Warlock.
---
Nah, play what you want. 
---
Full destro wasn’t really a raid spec but was great for pvp.
---
Raid as SM/Ruin that isn’t as gear dependent or DS/Ruin which let you sacrifice such for 15% shadow damage.
---
Same.  I raised my typed wpm from about 30 up to 120 just by playing wow during vanilla.  Gotta try to fit a whole sentence into that gcd after all.
---
I love you. For the Horde!
---
You are very useful once properly geared, like after T2. However it’s hard to BG as holy without decent dps or a premade
---
I love you both
---
Well I suppose it depends how much lore you want. 
---
If you want to know broadly who the main actors are in the world, the motivations of a few of the races, and how they’ve ended up in their WoW ‘starting locations’ Warcraft III and TFT will suffice. 
---
If that’s not enough for you and you want more depth and detail on the above then I guess the books are a place to go (disclaimer - I haven’t read any as I am happy with what I know from Warcraft III). 
---
If you’re someone who wants less detail than Warcraft III gives then just get it straight from WoW. When WoW was at its height it would have drawn in plenty of people with no prior knowledge of Warcraft III and they still would have had a great time with the game. 
---
While I am a native English speaker, one thing that WoW helped me with tremendously (as well as RuneScape) is typing speed.
---
In middle school, I took keyboarding class where I'd learn home-row typing (is that what it's called)? Anyway, my practice for what I learned at school would be playing WoW when I got home. 
---
Actually, now that I think about it -- even as a native speaker, games such as WoW and RuneScape helped my vocabulary immensely. Even just the names of zones, NPC's, skills, and items. Words like sepulcher, patriarch, matriarch, and countless others. 
---
You don’t want to man. Trust me. Keep it your own. 
---
To address your argument, assuming the OP has a pocket blacksmith jumper cables engi is a level of projection greater than when you falsey accused me of projection..... It is beyond any REASONABLE interpretation.
---
Gank them all!
---
My memory fails me -- are there any truly worthwhile quests that make going to Desolace and Feralas worthwhile? I only recall doing a few quests in either of those zones. 
---
I'm a Horde main who is considering playing Alliance in Classic to see the other side of the narrative. We'll balance each other out.
---
I remember the screenshot contests!! Does Blizzard still do those current-day?
---
Wars are super fun. Once you get your pre raid and you actually gain rage there are a lot of buttons to press.
---
There is also the noncommon slam spec which feels good to play.
---
I think there will be closer to 12-14% Shamans on Horde, which results in about 6-7% Shamans overall on a server (assuming a 50/50 split between the factions). The data of the recent surveys say as much at least.
---
With these two can be god tier or shit tier. The choice is yours when you want to be it.
---
Hunter: God tier leveling and gold farming.
---
Warrior: God tier endgame tanking/dps.
---
In later stages of the game, you will always be wanted as a warrior, but not so much as hunter, while early game warriors look with envy at the Hunters breezing through in no time and farming devilsaur uncontested. 
---
Does a full time job after college count. I'm still going to play the shit out of classic 
---
At this point I don’t think I can give up playing through the Alliance starter zones and dungeons. I might make Shaman my “main alt” though 
---
Man, that's one of the best things about him.
---
To each their own, I guess.
---
Usually, among these crowds, we had voice chat and they gave feedback on what was working against them and what wasn’t. 
---
You adjust and try again. Typically I had the rule that I must beat them when they use cool downs and I do not, at least once. 
---
Just in time to delay mowing the yard by another 2 hours.
---
That sounds like a really good compromise to be honest. 
---
Of course the people that don't like flying mounts can always just not use them. I could understand their trepidation on old PvO servers but from what I understand in modern WoW you can't be randomly ganked even in a PvO servers so those noobs who don't want to fly should *just not fly*. 
---
&gt;Witcher 3 is a long ass game. You can easily reach 100 hours played before even finishing the base game, let alone the expansions.
---
There's plenty of games that fit in that category but take less than an hour to set the pace. Not saying people don't get hooked sooner than 9 hours, but I personally didn't, and you replied like it was a normal thing. I love leveling in vanilla wow, and think it is one of the best things about it. As I said, vanilla wow had me hooked in less than an hour and it kept expanding and making each hour I put into the game more worth it. The Witcher just didn't do that for me. But I hadn't played W1 or 2 beforehand since everyone told me it didn't matter.
---
I love RPG's so of course I love storytelling. I've said a bunch of times now to others that the story seemed like it had great potential and would be the main draw to come back despite the negatives for me (combat, controls, simple npc's in towns). Skyrim wasn't good either IMO, and I have no problem with playing an established character. In fact it's preferred for me. I didn't mind Geralt (except for the fact how it's pronounced lol). Just the pace of the game felt off, and the combat was not up to my standards, which is a large part of the game I assume. 
---
I'll look into the mods, someone else suggested some too
---
There’s also something satisfying and immersive about choosing what your character needs and then going out to explore the world to gather and collect those things. As opposed to just following the same quest path every day. 
---
What professions should I do if I'm planning on lvling as a balance druid. Will mainly be duo lvling with irl friend and we plan on doing wpvp, dungs, and getting to end game content. My guess is herb and something else. My buddy will be playing a melee dps class if that makes any difference.
---
" she's never played a game before and sees them as a waste of time. At  the same time she's willing to binge watch a series on Netflix "
---
basically ever female human on planet earth
---
You'll especially enjoy windfury procs in that case.
---
Literally the opposite for me. I was on a bus reading the manual for TBC (I bought the expansion late) in late 2007 when this utter beauty tapped me on the shoulder and struck up a conversation with me about min-maxing in TBC. Right out of a fucking movie. We broke up later because long distance sucks, but man. Love of my life, that one. Haven't met one close to her since. I met her husband last year. Nice bloke.
---
The most important part of being good at Classic WoW, and good at being a hunter, in particular, is getting gear.
---
As a hunter, you are very lucky in this respect - you can use every item that drops.
---
So, if you are in a group, and you see an item drop, you need to click need. Always click need.
---
It depends... Are we talking about raids? What raids? In what patch? What about progression? Do you have on use trinkets? Do you have that raid on farm? Does your GM allow you to take some risks? What about your gear?
---
Sometimes, you are a mage in MC and you just spam frostbolt. Other times, you are a mage and have to manage a lot of AoE spells, trinkets, consumables... and lets not talk about how difficult it is to be efficient as a fire mage in naxx, which most bosses have a lot of mechanics and you gotta move a lot, while not fucking up the stacks.  
---
About warlocks, yes you spam a lot of shadowbolts, but again, trinkets, pots, AoE, curses... There are many variables.
---
It depends on how you want to play.
---
lol no one cares. 
---
Yep! I even prefer rockbiter over windfury for leveling until you get more crit lvl 45+. 
---
Luckily we should have dps addons by that time to help make decisions, OP should remember to factor armor/ fire resistance too when choosing.
---
This video made me legit cry. I'm an old man.
---
Played time doesn't prohibit you from doing DM:E  jump runs or lasher farming though.  You just get to do less of them.
---
Uhh, you do know shamans are only Horde, and paladins are only Alliance right?
---
    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)
---
While wanting to relive past heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared.    
---
Off nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over rate of players.    
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.    
---
Leaders of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.  
---
**Raid nights will be:** 
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)  
---
    
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!
---
**Loot System:** 
---
    Loot Council
---
**Our Goal:** 
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.
---
**Requirements:** 
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)  
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)  
---
    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

Perfect. Only thing missing is the dead flightmaster.
---
It's not even a matter of Disinformation it's the fact to me that *they don't have to do this shit* but they still complain. XD 
---
I think it's just overload. It took me awhile to get used to this sort of thing but it's how all games are now days. 
---
It's like going into a restaurant with a buffet and being presented a menu. You can still be free to just go to the buffet and do whatever you want. Don't piss all over the place because you got offered a menu! XD

In my experience people who don't see the difference between watching TV for 4 hours straight or playing a video game for 4 hours straight aren't going to start seeing that difference, you can't convince them.

Tried to get my ex boyfriend into WoW when we were together. No dice. He tried it once to shut me up and never touched it again.
---
Tried to get my husband into WoW back in Wrath. He rolled a Tauren something-or-other, did 3 quests, and never touched it again.
---
My brother tried to get me into WoW when it first released. The cartoony, kiddie graphics had me convinced utterly that it was a children's game and I didn't see the appeal. I tried it when I learned you can kill other players. I don't know why, I just thought that was hugely amusing and wanted to try it myself.

If she's into Lord of the Rings, you could tell it's a fantasy setting loosely based on Tolkein's creations i.e. elves, dragons, orcs, magic, etc. When it launches just casually ask her if she would like to try it. If she's not interested, she's not interested, though.

In the same news, baby boomers who watch TV 6 hours a day think internet is a waste of time.

The worst part about that was probably thinking you're finally going to do something new and interesting for the day, and then realizing you're in WoD.

I used to play like 5 hours a day when I was younger. Frankly, I thought I was being quite responsible when I would "limit" myself to 5 hours in a given day. Yikes. Hahaha. And even then, I'd often times fail. "Just one more quest." You guys and gals know how it goes. That said, as a child, though I would play for far too much each day, I wouldn't be able to block out like three straight hours for the game. I'd usually get interrupted. My parents would eventually make me take a break, or call me to dinner -- all things far more important than WoW, obviously. So no biggie.
---
However, now as an adult that lives alone and supports myself with a good job, I'm excited about the prospect of being able to get home and go, "You know, it's been a tough week. I'm gonna get dinner delivered and just play WoW for the next five hours because I feel like it." Not every night; I have bigger fish to fry (though don't think that I don't want to!). But for the nights that I just want to take a load off -- I can play for like five straight hours. And that's exciting.
---
Everything will be needed, just remember that classes that can heal are usually expected to heal in raids (Shamans, Paladins, Priests, Druids) as their DPS and Tank Specs (if any) are sub-par to pure DPS classes (or Warriors in terms of tanking). Warriors are actually the only exception. They are good at both their possible roles, DPS and Tanking.
---
So play whatever you think you will enjoy, but keep in mind that it might be (a lot) harder to find raid groups for certain Specs.

You can just ignore that shit. 
---
Just like how in Vanilla instead of spending 100% of time dedicated to raid prep and dungeons/raids you had the option to go do the auction house, level raids, or world PvP. 
---
If classic WoW is a buffet then modern WoW is a buffet with a menu for the people to lazy to go to the buffet.
---
You can seat the menu out of the way and go to the buffet.
---
Uhh, yes I do ... what did I write to suggest otherwise? I am kinda baffled by your question
---
It is viable as OT.  But until AQ your in a rough place.  You deal less damage then furry warriors.  And your gear is highest armour (75% reduction) and highest hp.  But your evasion is lower and your not crit immune.  The healers should be able to heal you fine. But you don’t got the same reactionary tools to survive.  You can’t drink hp in bear form. You can’t use health stone.
---
But most of all you need to convince the rl your viable.  I tanked Mc once we started running bwl as a bear.  But your compete with rogues with gear and rogue is often priority over feral druid.  
---
Kid in that photo is vonhelton
---
I think you mean 12-14%. The polls that go around on forums end up being 6-7% but you have to remember that isnt divided between horde and alliance like the other classes. So you have to double it, or halve the others to have a more accurate representation. On pservers right now shaman is 2nd most played behind warrior. That being said there is still a large demand for shaman. A lot of people prefer them for 5 mans, and there are plenty of spots in raids. 
---
In my experience, mages are flakey raiders. We had 3 solid mages on lightbringer, the rest came and went.
---
Then again, people who want to play void elves deserve worse.
---
The info that there are probably only 6-7% shamans on Horde is probably wrong. Do not make your decision based on it.
---
Meh.  Having the option of dailies doesn't mean they're mandatory.  I never struggled with feeling obligated to complete them.
---
Hello Josh, I have a question for Kevin in part from conversations with the folks on good morning azeroth. There is some confusion are the hardness racial trait for orcs, some believe it only increases a base 15% resist of stuns (3.75%), when others believe it's the additive 25% straight, whether the base is 5 or 15%. I would love it Kevin could answer this question for us because the verbage leaves room for speculation.
---
Thanks
---
They've never been not optional...
---
Nice thank you !
---
thank you !
---
Dailies were the first thing I met in Wow that I truly disliked and couldn't see the purpose of. The whole mechanic felt forced to me, like addiction was something to be fostered and rewarded. 
---
You don’t have to do dailies lol
---
Wait, people is that mercenary in classic? Speaking of the "social" aspect of the game... 
---
However, what about healers? I mean, their spec are even less posed to do damage I guess...
---
Probably green. They said they won't be messing with most minor item changes like this. Just the major ones around gated content.
---
If you know the right spots, not even gadgetzan guards can save them. 
---
I came back from quitting at the end of wrath to play BFA. I had a bit a fun, enjoyed the story (to apoint), the updated graphics.  But holy shit how i hated the "dailyness" time gates on everything. Want to unlock High-mountain tauren? oh just do these 6 random quests everyday for a few weeks, EVERY DAY. In the old days I could sit down on a single Friday night and pound out 8 hours of farming mobs while i watched youtube. They catered the entire experience it seems to forcing you to log on every day instead of being able to tailor my play time to say one long session on a friday and Saturday night.
---
After my raiding guild kind of died after killing normal gahuun I kinda lost interest. Its amazing how fast it sort of petered out at that point. 
---
Played time doesn't per-se no...but as I was so "helpfully" informed people don't consider played time to have any bearing on whether or not you're casual anymore...supposedly :P  It can't be both ways....
---
All I'm gathering from this conversation is people don't actually CARE if there's a legit reason for it to be nerfed, they will *always* find a reason for that to be incorrect...probably because they want to protect their ability to farm massive amounts of gold without any chance of pvp interference or having to contest camps with their own faction.
---
&gt;Without them, players are free to farm gold in ways that make sense to them -- selling lower level instance runs, key services, or just going on Mining/Herbalism gathering binges.  These are examples of emergent gameplay at it's finest.
---
... because the mere existence of dailies somehow make people unable to do any of that other stuff?
---
Yeah it surprises me that nobody ever talks about it, this was easily one of my favorite events the whole time I played.
---
most accessible raid, fun boss fights with fun mechanics, not too much trash, mount drops, decent loot (zinrokh etc), fast to clear. i would clear it multiple times each week on my alts, but i much prefer BWL for the boss fights.
---
I would argue that the difference between Hunter, Warlock, and Mage are negligible 
---
This is what worked on my end.  She saw me playing, rolled her eyes, but showed her the hunter class.   I left for work that day and showed her how to make a character in case she wanted to give it a try.   She hit 60 before I did.
---
Optional quests you can repeat every day for gold and reputation that people in this thread seem to think were mandatory for some reason.
---
Well that doesn't make me feel any better. Thanks, Frontier! Literally the worst company I've ever had to deal with. 
---
Let's set it aside and make of reality what we will. No I'm sorry but thats rather asinine. You or someone you know may be unable to self-regulate, and no person is perfect at it, but neither is everyone you. Not surprised by your last bit, you never did intend to have a conversation in the first place. You are merely one of the many who treat reddit as their personal outlet and get offended when anyone threatens that.
---
What a shame we'll never sit down and talk in person.
---
No, but it took over as an efficient manner of making gold.  So rather than having lots of people doing lots of different things, you have the entire population just doing dailies to save money, rather than farming and interacting with each other.
---
Later, even more things got tied to dailies in the form of rep grinding, making them even more chore-like.
---
Thanks.
---
Vanilla definitely had moderation. I legit question anybody who says they played in vanilla but somehow doesn't remember the snappy, prompt GM staff response to tickets.
---
Can we get that in English?
---
You should always AH things while leveling, especially crafting materials, and that'll be true on Classic as well.
---
It's applied economics.  In any edition of WoW, max level characters make vastly more money than anyone else, so the value of items to them, which is the value of the time that they'd require to farm the items themselves, is the value on the AH.  For example, if they're trying to respec a trade skill on their main, or powertradeskill an alt, and that trade skill requires, for example, copper ore, well that ore would still take them a while to collect if they did it themselves. So they'll be willing to pay what that time is worth to them to a level 10 character who's selling the ore.  And what that time is worth to their level 60 is completely another world to the economics of somebody with a level 10 main.
---
So, for those level 5 gloves, what you do is farm copper ore (or whatever), sell the copper ore on the AH to the alts of people with max level characters, and that'll give you the absurd amount of money you need to buy the level 5 gloves.
---
People talk about choosing which skills you'll learn because skills cost money in vanilla, or the grind to buy your level 40 mount.  But those things will only be expensive for the first people to hit those levels.  Once people with level 60 mains are buying things on the AH for their alts, the prices you'll be able to get on the AH for selling lower-tier trade goods will dwarf the prices of lower level skills and mounts.  (The max level mounts will still be brutal, though.)
---
Just looked it up, that's pretty funny!
---
WoW is the reason I am a fast typer.  I was too scared to talk on vent so I typed everything!
---
Never said that you can't play any of those, just that raid spot availability is a legitimate concern when picking a class. 
---
Good, dedicated players are always in demand, regardless of class.
---
MMO's didn't teach me English, as in the language, but they've helped my grammar immensely over the years.
---
I credit a lot of online games for teaching me. Sure, I knew things, but they really refined my intelligence, if you will.
---
This is not true at all. Shamans are among the most popular classes on Horde right after warrior, on par with rogue.
---
Literal exact same story for me. French-canadian as well and having people joke about my accent helped my english pronunciation so much.
---
We are almost at 550 signatures!
---
He’s an old man who does youtube videos now.
---
Shamans are among most played classes after warrior on horde side. This guy doesnt know what he is talking about.
---
Can't wait for that. But can enchantment shaman also be useful in raids or do i need to respec at that point?

I would do herb/skin. You can sell everything to help afford your epic mount at 60.

Alternatively, you could bank them and level Alchemy/Leatherworking at 60, but you may run out of bank space.

Lasting stats, and a single use item aren't comparable. A steel weapon chain is a 1 USE item, and key is a 1 USE item. The effect can be as lasting or as short as you want. You are running a raid a OEB drops you weapon chain it cause why not, you kill rag and a BRE drops. You upgrade weapons re-chain the BRE and you effectively never used the OEB and the weapon chain did nothing, had no lasting effect. You get a blacksmith to open a lockbox, you get whatevers inside you move on. Or you decide to have a blacksmith open the door to library in DM North. You go in, you get a libram done, boom you have a permanent enchant thanks to a single key from a blacksmith. Similarly to a single chain from a blacksmith giving an enchant.  
---
My point is no longer that weapon chain should be on the list, its that keys shouldnt be.
---
Hint: The demand for low level items is from transmog. Now even people leveling up have a use for the AH
---
Unlike the other guy just said, shamans and paladins are really popular for their own factions, usually right after warriors, around the same with mages. 
---
Macros help so much, especially with pet management. You can google guides to help build the macros, although currently with little information on how macros will work in classic its tough but learning the theory behind them helped me a ton. 
---
Also get a shot timer addon. It is a must.

Mass effeect is a phenomenal series to be sure! I did enjoy divinity series aswell, but dropped the first one after a little bit and only barely finished chapter 2 of the latest one. The shady behavior of the devs did kinda color my view on the game negatively as well -My understanding is that they effectively marketed 2 games, then pulled all money from the ones combat system - dragon commander or some such - and put it towards the main series. (It is easily seen in the quality of dialogue vs combat) I find that a tad malicious, and a shame besides as it could have been a good game, but i do suppose they did what they thought best.
---
I've not tried pillars of eternity yet. Is it worth picking up? Dragonage i couldn't get into, i think its because i tried during the bad one, 2 was it? Fallout is stellar but not great imo, but then i prefer scifi or skyrim/witcher aesthetic over post-apocalypse.
---
Witcher has immense potential, definitely hoping you decide to try the mod thing and give it a go. You are missing out on one of the greatest games of this decade imo.

You would 100% get a temp suspension for swearing in game in vanilla if someone reported you. 
---
I just hope it drops before mid-August now, Borderlands 3 is out on September 13th, I don't want to have to choose between leveling and playing one of my other favorite franchises. 
---
No changes. 
---
Feral druid, look at some old videos and be amazed by how much utility, decisions, and buttons to press. It's what I'll be rolling especially for Wpvp. You will be flag carrier and BG's and you can get into raids because I honestly think people arent going to be shunning ferals from PVE anymore.
---
Interesting, why do you think that is?
---
If you want to invade cities then play a rogue because stealth. 
---
I must admit I'm starting to get a little worried about how much people are putting on this release. It feels like some people are going through a 1/3rd - mid life crisis and are expecting classic will cure that. 
---
I'm a bit confused here as well. Since Shamans are Horde-only, if 12-14% of class population was Shaman for the Horde, then it'd be 12-14% of class population for the entire server is Shaman too. There's no division because there's no faction split, since only one faction can be the class.
---
My gf is actually the one who got me into playing wow again :D
---
Yes I was a warlock hah
---
My brain hurts trying to decipher...
---
Usually respec :(
---
extreme time commitment DOES TEND to translate into skill, it's LITERALLY why the phrase "10,000 hours to mastery" exists...
---
It's why the guy with 10,000 hours beats me in PVP almost every time, because he's literally done it THOUSANDS of times and knows most of the tricks.  They usually only lose if they miss a click or lag out...
---
Sounds like the exact same issue I'm having, same company and everything. They can do it, they just won't. If they would've told me from the beginning that they couldn't, I would be totally fine with it. I just wouldn't have bought the house.
---
Because Paladins exist for the Alliance and Shamans exist for the Horde, when talking about server population, their % would be lower when just talking about faction population
---
LAN party at this asshole's house!
---
So meta.
---
Alright, then I'll elaborate. Most recent data showed a pick rate of about 6-7% as OP said. But taking into account that only Horde can pick Shaman, it should be about double. The 50/50 Split between factions is important so we can actually double it. Otherwise the factor would be different, but so would be the overall percentage.
---
So the server-wide rate of Shamans might be 7%, but if the split is 50/50 then we know that the percentage of Shamans is 14%. Is it clearer now?
---
I don't get how discord can be compared to any other VC software on the market. It's easy, accessible, has a nice UI, allows you to have a profile and identity and you can create your own server for free in 5 seconds with 0 limitation.

Hey man! I listen to your podcasts every day and am constantly checking for new content. Love your show. Keeps me stoked for Classic. You are one hell of a host!

Yeah I got it now, I read it too fast lol and forgot to account for alliance %, instead of the only the entire horde class %.
---
My fault! Sorry

---
They don't want them to stack too high because the fear is you'll never kill a warlock. Now I don't necessarily think that's true, especially if they have a CD (I don't remember) but if there is no CD it make a lot of players unable to kill them before they get wander to death.... 
---
I remember having a simple macro that cast hunter's mark, send pet, auto shot, but I never got too in depth. I'll definitely get a shot timer to optimize DPS.
---
I don't wanna know anything negative about divinity devs! I haven't picked up original sin 2 yet, and was looking forward to it lol.
---
Pillars of Eternity is fantastic man. The writing and immersion is top notch. If you love Baldur's Gate you'll love PoE. So much depth to it.
---
I didn't play any of the newer Dragonages as they looked too different from what I wanted, both 2 and 3. I played through origins twice and both times were awesome. I love how that game gives NPC's so much dialogue, which is what I compare all games to now days for a standard. I recommend Origins for sure. 
---
I really dig the post apocalypse theme a lot, so I had fun with every FO game. I can get into guns a lot more than swords and shields etc too. It also helps that the gameplay of fallout versus elder scrolls is a better feeling to me, since it's easier to give a good feel to a gun than it is to a melee weapon.
---
Deciding between warrior, Druid, and hunter. Worried that Druid tanking is boring, can anyone elaborate?
---
this fuck doesn't fuck?
---
Yeah, I remember seeing some hunters who seemed to excel at basic movement, but I was (and am) sausage fingers. I need to work on that.
---
I'll check them out. Thanks.
---
&gt;IIRC someone compared Naxx logs one time and found that the Druid tank was taking somewhere around 30% more damage than the Warrior tanks were.
---
Funnily enough this is the complete opposite of reality.

Underrated comment.
---
Priest warlock Paladin shaman mage
---
I would say warrior for sure. Dynamic rotation based on rage. Decided when to pool or not, pushing heroic strike use for dps but not too much to pull threat, CD usage, etc. Rogue is still combo point builder, snd, eviscerate in between. There are things that certainly separate the good rogues from the great. But I would still argue warrior is more fun.
---
Plus getting pre raid bis is probably the easiest to get since you can reserve anything you want as a tank. People will be desperate for tanks and you can have a lot of say with the group composition. I know this sounds scummy but its going to happen. Likewise if you refuse to tank at all pre raid bis will be a nightmare.
---
If you are playing a healer. They can all AOE farm herbs from DM when it comes out. Money might be a little tight till then though.
---
&gt; Dude every other game right now just seems so boring
---
Try Sekiro if you like Action RPGs. I'm legit hooked on it and haven't pined for Classic as hard as I was before.
---
alternatively, if you pull a bear indoor they are extremely vulnerable and lose the abillity 
---
ah i see, should i go with healer/ele for raids then. Tho how well does windfury work if i would be specced ele, healing or both?
---
facts dont care about your feelings triggered druids *brofist*
---
Yeah, as I said before, I went back and reread the entire convo, I thought you guys were only talking horde class population, not entire server. Sorry
---
If tanks are as hard to find as one private realms. I would gladly surrender my orbs to not have to wait on a tank. I don't think it's hard to res anything while playing a tank. Their will always be intelligent players who see the benefit of saving time is worth far more then a 1/5 chance of getting an orb.
---
Discord or mumble 
---
Replying to the edit- you arn’t wrong at end game with item scaling and the second you have good flurry uptime as enhance. Rock biter only competes early due to a high base ap value, scaling poorly with gear and flame tongue has a terrible spell power coefficient causing the same issues
---
does she know nightelves are basically bastardized trolls?
---
Really?
---
Vanilla chat was pretty wild thorough vanilla and tbc and it could be different in US though?
---
I am currently leaning towards Mage or Warlock, but open to anything except tanking I think. 
---
Really I just want a character that I can farm/make gold on, while also holding my own in raids and some pvp(not very experienced here) preferably without respeccing too often! Also a bit of role playing.
---
From what I hear Mages are the best farmers, but I think need different specs for farming/pve/pvp? Also I prefer their aesthetic for role playing.
---
Warlocks I know for sure can use the same SM/ruin for pve and pvp, but I am unsure of gold making potential? I don't really know about role playing a warlock since I don't want to be an edgelord.
---
Divorce wife and marry a cis male chadliance player.

Real vanilla heads went to all three places, as skipping STV would mean hours of hours of endless farming to take back that lost XP.

Also, STV is super good for leveling. Those STV chapter quests are super nice to complete
---
#nochanges troll the shit out of newbies 
---
I want to go Warrior just because I hate waiting for groups to form. However my biggest concern is gold. Is there anything warriors can do to earn gold outside of reserving items in dungeons to sell? (Also do people even join groups w/ tanks who do that?) 
---
Also I know warriors are supposed to scale really well in PVP. However, with everyone being locked into just MC gear at first, will I just be stuck getting rolled by other classes waiting for the next raid to release?
---
Daily's refers to repeatable quests that you login and do once a day every day. 
---
In Vanilla there are no quests with a once a day timer. There are some that are repeatable as soon as you turn them in. Of course there were still daily tasks you did in Vanilla. 
---
Raiding was on a weekly timer. Dungeons on a daily. 
---
I think the issue is that Vanilla had lots of amazing hidden gem like items that came from random old dungeon you out-leveled and world mobs as well as once only quests. Also farming was a valid thing. Farming is boring AF to most people but some enjoy it. 
---
The main thing is classic WoW felt like a very diverse ecosystem with lots of diff types of plants and stuff. The daily island while great seemed artificial to some which isn't necessarily bad. But it also was such a good source of gold that other methods become worthless. 
---
Wealth is relative of course. So this meant crafter's and grind-farmers were worse off than somebody who logged in once a day for an hour of playtime 
---
As a pvp rogue in TBC, you should have speccer disk :D
---
well taurens are op becouse you can warstomp + trap, and save your scatter shot plus the extra hp, in the end they are pretty good for pvp, but orcs are simple OP, the stun resist in vanilla was way diferent than tbc or wotlk it got nerfed it used to be 25% to resist stuns instead of stun duration reduction, resisting a warrior's charge or a rogue's stun is just godlike.
---
I wouldn't say "nothing"...
---
I'll try out TS5 for about 12-13 seconds, close it down and open the Discord tab back up. 
---
I think rogues tend to do very well against shamans....
---
i would say your time constraints are a good reason to go warrior if she goes heals. Won't have to waste time twiddling your thumbs hoping to find a tank(or heals) - you have the meat and potatos of a group ready to go. Theres always a million dps around, which cant be said for the other 2 roles.

have another tank rdy to go? cool u can just dps, nbd

Alright, added pillars to my wishlist. Hopefully it'll be on sale soon (it is 40% atm but thinking it might go lower ?) Should i go for #1 or #2?
---
I gave origin a go and stuck with it far longer, it was a bit dated tho. Aye i did pick you for having that preference, i can get that, even if i have the opposite ^^ Hey speaking of RPGs, what do you intend to do come vanilla? PvP server? Class/faction? You eu or US?
---
You have a lot of things I don't think are really good for end game PvE or PvP:
---
* Deflection and Riposte are not needed, as you will always want to stand behind the enemy anyways, same goes for dodge
---
* I don't think improved kick is really useful. In PvP you want to keep your victim in stun lock anyways.
---
* Dagger Spec is probably better than dual wield. You mainly just want to apply your poison with your off-hand anyways.
---
* Sleight of Hand is not useful. If you do pull aggro in PvE, just vanish.
---
* Ghostly Strike is probably more useful for a sword spec, where you actively duel agains your enemies. With daggers you want to stunlock and burst down, no Ghostly Strike needed.
---
* I am always undecided on improved Sap, but I think there are more important talents to pick.
---
Overall, this is what I came up with, when keeping your big milestones in mind: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AQwE8zzJBATzwwxE

I am not exactly sure if Camouflage 5/5 is necessary, if 3/5 is enough then I'd put the two points into Dirty Deeds.

---
This is more than close enough. Not that its really relevant if they can reach armor cap and not, because Warriors suffer from the exact same issues vs higher level enemies. What matters is that Druids can reach a much higher direct damage reduction than Warriors in similar tier gear.

What is the best spec of Rogue for killing lowbies?
---
Youre lucky enough to have a gal that will play wow with you.  Suck it up and play alliance.
---
I was on the opposite side of this as I usually beat close to everyone as a shadow priest (awesome for duels). Had a rogue that was really good try like 20 times before he won and then he didnt want to do it anymore :)
---
The game has had moderation, but it was largely left up to players to ignore and use profanity filter
---
You wouldn't get muted, suspended or banned for cussing like you get today
---
Ultimately in community centered game I think enforced supervision will end up withering the community, no one likes to tip toe around when you feel bit naughty, more so in subscription game where you need incentive to pay and play, if you end up just thinking it's tiresome to tip toe around when *that* guy comes to your raid or even the same zone
---
I mean we're talking about a community centered game. Spamming NEGRO in chat is good way to get yourself isolated from other players, which I think should be part of the game
---
You're just making me realize I had no idea what I was doing as a 17 year old idiot wow player
---
have another tank rdy to go? cool u can just dps, nbd  
---
say, for example, it takes you 20mins to find a tank. then takes 20 mins to find one for your second run.  
---
after 3 hours you ran strat(or w/e) twice  
---
or, if you choose tank, there is no 20 minutes wait.  
---
in this case, after 3 hours, you could have ran it three times
---
Resto shaman please.  Can never find enough 
---
Feral druid sounds great! I am worried about the relatively low damage output compared to some pure DPS classes. Do druids struggle to secure kills in PvP?   
---
Also, I am a bit of a min-maxer by heart, so if I were to play druid in raids I would opt to play resto. Will acquiring gear sets for PvP and PvE be a struggle considering I would likely play feral in PvP?   
---
Thanks for your help!   
---
Resto sham, collect elemental raid gear, blow people up

LAST week on my OTHER podcast the CINEPHILES
---
Boooo
---
I keep hearing people say it's an action RPG now but I'm curious when that kicks in. I tried a demon Hunter once and it felt like that but my rogue stioo felt pretty old-school tab-target-like. 
---
Tell her she can make a nigh elf on horde, and then just make her character as *that one* pretty face troll.
---
I was going to play undead priest but all my friends are playing alliance, so now I'm having a really hard time choosing a class to play on alliance. My top 3 choices right now are Priest, Hunter and Rogue but can't decide. Any suggestions? I'm planning on primarily doing PvP
---
brilliant 
---
Unpopular opinion: your unpopular opinion about my unpopular opinion about "unpopular opinion" not actually being unpopular is not actually unpopular, isn't actually unpopular.
---
Feral druids can kill any cloth in 2-3 hits from stealth in pvp. Look up a druid named Seeker on YouTube. As for pve resto would be best. And no gearing feral shouldn't be hard because of the lack of people who will be playing them. Also raids won't have more than 2 druids cause fairy and innervate
---
What would a spec like that look like?
---
Does this come close?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0xZGcVbbEz0boEMh
---
Are you saying there is an error? Because if so, I can't see it.
---
The three items at the top are listed as "Crafted BoP". Are you saying that is not the case? The last one is a set bonus that requires Tailoring to become active. Are you saying that is not true?
---
You do what your wife wants.
---
It will go. . a very. . very .. long way.
---
Yea, blizzard didn't actively go after people but if someone reported you, you would recieve a suspension. 
---
A rogue on smolderthorn got several people in my guild suspended multiple times just following them around at a distance in stealth and reporting anything bad they said.  Got to the point where people in my guild just stopped speaking in /say.
---
Someone in my guild also got a like 1-2 day suspension for using an asian racial slur in party chat in an all guild raid, someone in his party got mad and reported him.
---
I was shure it was more of a Blink at one point. I remember using it in the alliance auction house.
---
They should add voice chat to bgs/parties/raids. I don’t see why not. 
---
“Christ...How the hell am I gonna get outa here now”
---
&gt;bruh u triggered bruh???

---
It seems you have two decisions: (1) gank wife in game or (2) give in then roll a Gnome (because Gnome's are the master race).
---
good, glad his """suffering""" is real then
---
Amusing.
---
you do realize that warriors don't care about crushing blows because as long as the swing speed of their target is slower than 2.1 (1.7 with a thunderfury in the raid)
---
reason being that shield block carries 2 charges and sits on a 5 sec cd. They don't care about them because they can completely prevent them whenever they want or need to.
---
Now tell me when flip hits the fan. Where is that 'you can't crit me and you can't crush me' button on a druid? Oh wait. It doesn't exist
---
Planning on doing a bt of everything (including RP), but will be focusing more on PvP than PvE. Thoughts between Dwarf Warrior, Gnome Rogue, or Alliance Warlock?
---
Obviously Discord.
---
Yeah that’s a simple and basic macro that will be great for levelling. 
---
I'm not sure the answer to granular questions like that, I'd talk to people who have a bit more experience as shammys. I've been horde at level 60 and raiding and seen shamans, but I haven't been a level 60 shaman so I wouldn't be the person to talk to there. 
---
Yeah, I mentioned in my own reply to OP that the old ticket system at least made you pause to consider if it was worth stopping what you were doing to fill out the report form. Usually it wasn't. I don't like the knee-jerk potential right click report has.
---
You make your own dailies. Usually that daily is farming the highest GPM method available to you 24/7, but at least you have a choice. 
---
Haha
---
This is the greatest post I’ve seen in sometime. I’m going with option D as well cause I love BTTF and WoW so it combines 2 of my most favorite things. Just watch out for your parents you don’t wanna have your mom fall for you and end up erasing yourself. 
---
You sound like your girl is a cunt
---
I think this decision tree is pretty straight forward. How much time do you want to spend in Azeroth? If the answer is all of it. Pick a warrior. It is the most rewarding class for the investment. That being said if you would like to have a real life. I would go with hunter. Warrior class is hardcore as hell. It has the most hardcore adherents. It will be by far the most difficult class to play as a casual.
---
As a hunter you will find a raid pretty easy. As a warrior. Becoming an MT is very hard and again means you will live on Azeroth. To be a warrior DPS means you will be competeing in a class that needs it's bis just to work and oh gee will all the other warriors get it. Warriors are not the type to go half measures. So only go warrior if you plan on diving in with both feet. 
---
the good thing about facts are... they are correct whether you believe them or not
---
I can usually torch rogues as an orc shaman. If you have some cds like pvp trink and ns then it can be tough for the rogue. There are times rogues get me but if I have that pvp trinket rdy then I can usually get out of range and sauce em
---
honestly, you can worry about the guides later and they'll only be 5 min reads or so. Classic wasn't all too deep in that regard.  
---
if you are raiding hardcore, you'll just respec often.  
---
otherwise, sure daggers are better in pvp but swords work too.  
---
swords work better everywhere else, classic has a lot of farming after all.  
---
i guess what im saying is, don't worry too much about all that at the moment. you'll figure out your exact needs once you are in the middle of it and those needs wont really matter at the start. raiding will take a little bit to get to and min-maxing can come along as you go.
---
40% seems pretty good to me. I think its certainly worth it if you got the time to put into the game. As for 1 or 2. I have only played 1 so far but I think 2 is supposed to be a sequel to the first, so I'd say go for PoE1 if continuity is important. 
---
The combat isn't turn based like in PoE2 though. So maybe research that a little to see if it will bother you or not.
---
Yes, I like guns in pretty much everything except in wow lol. We talked a bit yesterday! :D I said I was rolling another rogue (Night elf this time) on a US based PvP server. Was gonna do LW/Skinning first and switch to Eng/Mine after a while.

"Legit" reasoning varies greatly from person to person.  
---
Blizzard has stated their guiding principle is to remake Classic as close to the retail version as possible.  I don't foresee them making changes to gold farming strategies.
---
I'm working my way through my old library, not too much more to go but I'm not trying to dump and have some of it be ignored.

I see, thank you nevertheless. I guess ill level as ench and then wonder what to do when ill get to 60.

Now i just have to stick with shaman.

I was in the same boat as you, being a little french canadian from Montreal as well. At 8 years old, I had to learn English to figure out how to play. I distinctly remember asking my dad a few times what ''soulbound'' meant and he got tired of telling me over and over so he told me to figure it out myself haha
---
Gotcha. I'm a WoW noob who could use the advice, so thanks for the info!

But discord in all seriousness. 
---
Sadly, the Night Elves have suppressed this chapter from their history.
---
I want to roll a druid but heard a lot of bad things about them come lategame. Mainly I want to either heal or tank. Will I find a healer spot for raids as a druid or should I rather go for a shaman/priest?
---
Doubt it, maybe a an old commercial with higher resolution from 2004.
---
I got warnings and temp bans for chat violations in vanilla. They enforced the ToS, it's just that it relied on reports just like it does today.
---
The only difference is that it used to take longer to fill out the report than a simple right click report so if the outrage wasn't sufficient enough to stop what you were doing, it probably didn't get reported.
---
But Blizz had a very well staffed, highly responsive GM team back then, and they absolutely did respond to reports.
---
... there is no Monk class in Classic

When Bilbo first went on his adventure, he didn't know what would happen. Gandalf prodded him, to be sure, but the decision to take that first step out of Bag End was his own. Tell her you'd really appreciate if she took that first step like Bilbo did.

It's actually  generation thing. I'm 25 and pretty much 95% of females demonize games. However I just started teaching middle school, and pretty much every single girl not only plays video games, the introduce themselves as a gamer or a streamer. When I told them when I was their age 0 girls would have played video games they were all shocked.
---
I feel like that this post by that title should be about rogues' Distract.
---
I see, well it could be that I was too young at the time and didn't follow anything but what was in my immediate vicinity and what guild chat had to offer
---
But I think the moderation today and during vanilla stand world's apart, even if we forego the system completely and only focus on how blizzard intervened, which didn't end in punishments
---
I remember being a naughty boy myself and questioning the sexuality of number of players and worst I got between vanilla and tbc was gm saying that it's not nice behavior

As a casual (due to wife/career) i'm rolling with Warlock. This is because on a FRESH server, it will help with ease of solo leveling, ease of mount acquisition, and give me a good char to blaze a trail on an account with 0 in game currency. To me this means with all the money I'll save I can bankroll other chars!
---
Ele/Resto shamans in group pvp, dungeons, and to a lesser extend raids to give melee totems while still being able to heal.
---
Also, if you are eleM instead of NS, you can get a couple SP trinkets and global people at will in world pvp.  It never gets old deleting people with a guaranteed trinket boosted crit chain lightning.

So you're saying to go with the PC approach?  Hmmm...she is very strong willed, and I doubt that I can shame her into going Horde.   In fact, she may even take pride in her Night Elf racism.  Cest La Vie, "the Alliance are meat, and the strong do eat".

Or in other words, why I'm not rolling a healer this time around as a main lol

Listen Josh, just a quick thank you from the other side of the small blue dot. I have to say that the quality of the content has increased since you stopped killing yourself with three podcasts a week. Buy the sinner boys a beer when you get the chance. Cheers mate, stix.

I only saw the first pic when I posted this. Ops. Warriors can offhand books if they are RPing though. 
---
What kind of UI addon are you using? I like the look of it
---
Don't play my main; it's awful, you'll hate your life, and your dog will leave you.
---
^^^Go ^^^away! ^^^There's ^^^too ^^^many ^^^of ^^^us ^^^already.
---
It's 2019, it goes both ways
---
You should have little to no problem finding a group as a druid healer. Tanking or DPS will probably be difficult though.
---
Idk I had a 6-7 day played toon with very little STV from what I remember if there was any at all. 
---
I thought I settled on mage, but the shaman is calling to me now. 
---
I probably wont commit until I actually am on that character creation screen.
---
*unequips all gear*
---
*ganks low level*
---
So what would you suggest a warlock should do fighting a mage? (e.g., which demon)
---
Oh, you sweet summer child....
---
You raise a good point, GnomeWarlock69.  I am SOOOOOO lucky to have a wife who shares my passion for WoW.
---
But what you suggest is blasphemy.  I can only assume that, given your user name, you have been driven mad by the horror being born a gnome.  
---
Idk I remember my Nelf rogue 1-60 in less than two weeks real time over summer break. Around 6-7 days played. 
---
Right, raids... I was replying to the guy who said they can only run 5 man's are you fucking stupid? can you pay attention before replying to me?
---
Bro you know my struggle. This is why I am not #nochanges. I never thought I would say this being raised a proper neck bear but, we need our blood elves. WE NEED THEM MAN!!! This is the same argument me and my GF are having. She want's to be a filthy allie because all our models are ugly. Please Blizzard give up blood elves so girls will play with us!!! 
---
I am lucky though. My girl friend pretty much wears the pants in our relation ship. It's almost pathetic how much a 6'3 245 pound gorrilla gets dominated by a girl who's 4'7 and 110 pounds. Frankly it's unfair. All that being said I was able to parley my myriad losses into one victory. This god damn midget has her little hands grasped around my heart but, not this time. This time if you want me to be a god damn knife ear you are gonna have to squeeze until I die woman. When I shrieked this at her. She relented and will now be playing a female orc.
---
So here's my advice. In the lead up to classic. Take all the loses. Just take L after L. Then when the time is right. Spring the reversal! A girl can only dunk on you so many times. 
---
r/wowservers
---
If the goal is to kill people considerably lower level than you, when you already start out as invisible, does the spec really matter? 
---
Let me guess... warrior?
---
HUNTER

I told her there was a class that collected different pets that needed love and food and training and she jumped on the game faster than a fat kid jumps on cake.

fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb, summon water/food, fb fb fb fb ok everyone needs a portal
---
Warrior: Probably has the highest skill cap in PvP, is very gear dependent, but can be really strong.
---
Rogue: Where the Warrior can just rush in and wreck face (with a healer to back you up), you'll want to pick of single enemies as a rogue. It can be a lot of fun!
---
Warlock: Remember that you have all those undead with WOTF against you. Otherwise Warlock is pretty strong in PvP, although I am not sure on the spec is the strongest in vanilla. I assume Affliction, but I'm not sure.
---
Ugh. This is a shitty situation to read about bro, I can't even imagine being in it. I'd just divorce and gank. 
---
There's nothing stopping you from rolling a horde as main and having an alliance character too. Unless of course it's a PvP server. Then it looks like your up excrement creek without a paddle!
---
This is just my experience on two different classic servers.
---
&gt; Good fury warriors are hard to come by, especially if you're trying to stack them.
---
Large over abundance of fury warriors majority of which are bad and few people will have the patience to get the gear for it. For every good dps warrior I deal with I deal with 20 mediocre and bad ones. Plus most of them outright refuse to tank anything. 
---
&gt; so you end up with an over abundance of healers, especially priests.
---
Yup literally never seen someone needing more healers especially priests. I saw a joke comment someone made about LFM need tank and good to go and the response was so you are looking for an entirely new group? Which wasn't much of a joke because of how replaceable everyone else is compared to how hard it is to find tanks. 
---
Mage, clearly. 
---
Only if the dowry is high enough.  I'm talking at least a Staff of Jordan, minimum!
---
&gt; Well, ideally you want at least 8-10 mages in every raid. So that's hardly surprising.
---
no you dont need 1/4th of the fucking raid to be mages
---
I find it so soothing. Most chill voice out there.
---

Earnestly, the only WoW players I've met that are this fanatical and/or proud about their faction are Horde players. I don't know why.

He is talking about demand though. When on earth is rogue more in demand for anything compared to a mage excluding those rare lockpick/disarm situations
---
Have an upvote.

Just wait for the 1st expansion, I hear Horde might be getting some kind of elf race
---
Way of Kings was the best book I ever read.....until I read words of radiance.  
---
I dunno, man... if you've been horde since 2004, isn't it about time you experience the other side of the game? Think about it, it'll lead to some new experiences in a game you've already fallen in love with. Plus, alliance has way better leveling zones. 
---
I've been alliance since 2006 but I want to try horde with classic. 
---
Yes I found it boring. Warrior has many more tools, abilities, cool downs etc. Druid tanking is almost entirely maul spam and or swipe spam.
---
Oh yes you will.

I mean that's not unpopular that's just the thing I never wanted until I thought about it and now I want it
---
Tauren nature robes when

Good problems to have
---
Bro i remember my guild mates calling me frenchman for obvious reasons :)
---
I'm in a same situation. I recently played a warrior and a hunter (both at 60) on a pserver to get the feeling.
---
Back on retail vanilla I actually started my journey with a hunter but eventually dropped it and leveled a warrior instead.
---
Thing is, back then it was all new and you didn't know the whole picture. So I didn't feel that a warrior was such a pain to level because I had no other class experience past 20-something. Obviously later on I figured it was more or less hard mode.
---
Some time along the journey I got to know that my life will be a nightmare at sixty with no gear so I started doing a lot of pvp and eventually it became my main interest in the game. 
---
I made it to rank 8 (that's 4/6 of the rank 10 blue pvp set) even before I was level 50 and I also hit exalted with WSG and AB in mid 50-something so it kinda boosted my confidence - I had the most slots covered with some decent stuff by the time I'd hit 60.
---
If I knew it would be possible to do it like this again - I'd roll a warrior. But my retail vanilla server had a ton of pvp in 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59 brackets, we even had a r12 or r13 shaman sitting at 59.
---
But private servers show us the example that people rush to 60 and then build some lowbie pre-30 twinks and that's it.
---
TL:DR: If there's no way to get ok gear prior to sixty via mid level pvp - I'm not rolling a warrior again. I had a taste of a warrior on a pserver with a fresh 60 start — no thanks.
---
I mean it's all warm and fuzzy to know you're more hardcore than the rest but we're all not the same as we were 15 years ago. Pick something that fits your real life nowadays. I'm sure I can invest even 1/3 of the time I had back then so I'm likely getting a hunter.
---
Godspeed op.... godspeed.
---
Not always, I have a coworker who went in ontario 1 month to perfect his english and let's say he came back with a minor difference. Having fun while learning is key ;)
---
BFD a long long run? I don’t know if we’re remembering the same instance. Deadmines was longer. 
---
Troll is bad.
---
I rolled gnome lock and loved PvP.  Just kept out my puppy and paranoia put speed on your boots and kite rogues fairly well.  Always a tough fight but WotF was less of an issue than people make it especially in BGs.  1v1 was tough but doable if you time things well.
---
&gt; Plus most of them outright refuse to tank anything. 
---
As a recruiting officer, that's one of the first things I ask any warrior "Are you willing to tank if needed?".
---
You don't have to like it, but it something that you'll have to do from time to time if you intend to raid as a warrior.
---
Sinner Files
---
That's rude.
---
I had an addon that allowed a short line associated with entries on the friends, ignore, and guild lists. 
---
Search for “note” on any vanilla/legacy wow addon site, should give you multiple options. 
---
No not trolls the non BC races
---
I absolutely get what you mean bro, at the time I knew the basis of english grammar but I came across so many new words and I was like ok... what is that word and what does it mean in that particular context. It really really helped widen my vocabulary
---
I have to disagree. One of the first experiences you go through during vanilla is having to make this choice. Removing it contradicts all the reasoning behind bringing back the game. Just my thoughts.
---
Yeah 3 months is extreme, i will be dropping everything for 1 week with no regrets however.
---
Something like this?  [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info17406-CharacterNotes.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info17406-CharacterNotes.html) 
---
Mind you that is for Live. But might work in Classic once the API is out.
---
Still searching for something we used to have back in the day. I have a foggy recollection that there was an addon.

HUH?????
---
Ret paladins might not have the deep numbers but they bring heart and soul into a raid
---
Classes already are so spread out with such a wide array of strengths and counters, this happens naturally. 
---
Shaman: Astrall Recall. While being one or the best ability imo in the game it could also be name of the Steven Seagal movie. Case closed.
---
I instantly think about changes and how we should not do them
---
It was also 4th grade.. thank wow because I wouldn't be talking to yall without a major push for understanding english
---
Wow PVP has always been Rock Paper Scissors. No one specific class dominates always all the time. That’s the beauty of it. 
---
If my friends went alliance I'd definitely go Night elf Hunter just for the shadowmeld alone. It saved my ass
---
Alliance Rogue boy-GANK TIME- WHERE THEM
---
CLOTHIES? ALLIANCE GETTING WHOOPED? NONE OF MY BUSINESS 
---
*casts stealth and runs*
---
My typing skills went from bare minimum to top in class due to this game.  Real educational stuff I got from it.
---
I played a dagger rogue in vanilla too. One of my toughest opponents was an elemental shaman too. Granted he had rank 13 gear while I had just MC/BWL and a lobotomizer/glacial blade, but he was pretty much unbeatable.
---
I also remember seeing a pvp video by a naxx geared rogue who dueled a naxx geared ele shaman, and it was a close fight even with CD's and thistle tea. He barely beat the shaman. My memory isn't perfect but long story short, I think they're good against dagger rogues lol :P

Can never have  to many vending machines/Kargath travel agents.

Roll Horde and let her roll Alliance on the same realm. Then "gank" her IRL ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Surprisingly this is still a thing: https://www.warcraftmovies.com/
---
Yeah, but you never know until it happens.
---
Gank wife, then divorce her in game
---
There are SO MANY MORE outplay mechanics and potential in classic wow than current BFA. BFA is pretty straight and streamlined, the only variance you have is different 3s comps, that's about it. Really aren't any outplay mechanics. In BFA you have everyone running the same comp, same trinkets, no variance at all apart from rmp/tsg/turbo/lsd/etc, but they all play the same.
---
New strats are always being found in classic, even after 14 years. Just watch perplexitys youtube vids where he duels certain players, mainly Goth. The shit he does there literally NO ONE else has done up until that point.
---
What does your buddy think only shines at the top end? I guarantee he's wrong. This is an education issue. Engineering, the profession alone, adds more to the game than what is currently in BFA pvp.
---
No way! First server i ever played was on gorefiend and I can swear I remember ember guild
---
I want to die.
---
I mean, since you like to play ugly character models you could roll dwarf or gnome. I don't see the problem.
---
NOOOO
---
I'd kill literally any person on this subreddit for a hot wife that played WoW with me so just play whatever faction she wants.
---
That was Classicast who had Mark Kern, he hasn’t been on Countdown! :P
---
But why, when with one simple click of your mouse you could *see more dab gifs*?!?!
---
Yeah the French Canadian GM was a mage named "Hellmage" if I remember correctly, and the GM when I was there was a warlock named "Xer".
---
Everyone begin combat with op right now. 
---
ts3
---
Not attacking OP directly but people like that is who Blizzard tried catering to and look where the game is now.
---
Lack of choice is sometimes the motivation to find more meaningful and special things to get excited about.
---
hordelets are pathetic creatures 
---
Your position comes from the idea that Blizzard should make a change to help retail players. Why though? Classic isn't an extension of retail, it's a n entirely separate game. This is fact because things in classic wont be linked to awards etc. On retail. 
---
It'd be like saying blizz should make changes to Heroes of the Storm to help ease Hearthstone players into the game. They're separate games. 
---
Yes Classic looks like retail in that it's an MMO AND it is what started retail, but they're just different games. Thus, no there shouldn't be alliance shamand and horde pallies, because the faction specific classes are a Feature, not a bug, and the devs dont need to make changes because honestly classic isnt coming about because they want the people already subbed to play a different MMO, they want the people not currently subbed and on Pservers to sub and jump on their new product. Those people would hate such a change as ALL faction classes, it'd be like a slap in the face. 
---
HYPE IS REAL
---
Mage is the safest class pick in classic. They excell in every aspect of the game. So not only do you have a lot of people playing them, but unlike warriors/rogues people actually stick with them.
---
Rogues are mostly popular due to wpvp/ganking, if you look at some of the polls, rogue make up a much smaller ٪ on pve servers than pvp.
---
So while both rogues and mages are very popular, mages tend to be more interested in raiding then rogues.
---
And just to be clear, this my personal experience from playing on a few pservers, things might play out completely differently in classic, though I doubt it.
---
Words of wisdom, N00bTaco, and so I've been told many times.
---
But, in the immortal words of Forrest Gump, "Ahm not a smaht man, but I know what lunch is."
---
I can't help but imagine your mustache is somehow involved in the act referred to here.  
---
Every old movie needs premium though :/
---
Isn't the free mount part of Dire Maul which won't be available for a bit?
---
Really good idea!
---
I will roll a goblin demon hunter anyway so it doesnt affect me... look forward to flying around on my spectral dragon in orgrimmar at lvl 60!
---
I'd say give it time. They take a while sometimes before it seeps into their sub subconscience. 
---
what kind of changes exactly
---
I have the same situation as you mate, I agree
---
It didn't teach me English but it did help me learn a lot of vocabulary at a young age. As well as 2 of the main guides on my server ended up being word on a spelling test in like 5th grade. Insomnia and notorious.
---
I charge extra for mustache involvement
---
Ive got an indistinguishable english accent despite being swedish and never having set foot in the UK thanks to raiding with a gang of english blokes for years 
---
For me its that Ive mained horde Prot pally since wrath but my friends are rolling horde in classic so Ive got to play something I dont enjoy or not play at all
---
Yup! They halved the price of all the upgrades in the most recent patch, thank goodness, as there's so many now it got kinda ridiculous in the gold price.
---
Depends how hardcore your guild is. Most guilds will be fine with taking 4-5 druids for healing. It's just the really top ones will only take 1-2 and prefer shamys/pallys for healing to stack buffs.
---
LOK’TAR OGAR! FOR THE HORDE!!
---
*Signs Divorce Papers*
---
it's like gambling. better stop while your ahead or else they could prove it was a fluke 
---
Take one for the team and roll Alliance.  Enjoying classic with a significant other is probably going to be the best gaming experience you'll ever have.
---
Also, you've got a few month to persuade her into rolling Horde.  The female horde models all have their own charm.
---
I dumped her and found a new one which actually appreciates wow.
---
delete this nephew
---
I mean for me personally its because ive mained horde prot pally since wrath because its what I enjoy the most, but my friends are rolling horde in classic.
---
locks are always in demand and fun to play , you have to farm some shards every tome you play its no huge deal.
---
with 40 people in a raid just being a lock can get you into good guilds
---
Nobody cares about Crushing Blows because Crushing Blows are not dangerous. They do 50% more damage than a regular white swing. Crits do 200%.
---
When your health pool is 12k+ you can get crit 4 times in a row before you die as a Druid. The bosses have a 2 second swingspeed meaning the shortest time you will live before you die is 8 seconds. Add in 30% dodge, and the fact that taking 4 crits in a row is extremely rare and you should never ever die from crits as a Druid.
---
If you do, it's a healer issue, not a Druid issue.
---
Here's some material you can read if you actually have an interest in informing yourself. Which I'm suspecting you dont.
---
Gnomes are good 
---
Druid tanking is definitely simpler than Warrior tanking. I would suggest you don't pick Druid if you *just* want to tank, Warrior is a way better choice then. Pick Druid if you like the versatility of the class.
---
Hunter is a great class and kind of its own thing and quite skill expressive, but also very active. You basically move around 2 characters and you have fantastic aggro control with FD, Distracting Shot, Growl and very good CC with your traps and shots. Also very versataile for PvP. You can see from a mile away if someone is a good Hunter or not (granted they aren't semi afk). They don't top the DPS meters in raids (anymore) but in PvP this is a different story because it is much more mobile, and this is where they excell: Constantly dealing damage while moving.
---
Warrior is one of the most group dependend classes (unlike Hunter/Druid) but they really excell at that. People falsely claim that this class is gear dependand. Well, for main-tanking a raid this is true. But outside of that they really aren't any more gear dependand than other classes. They just kind of suck solo and gear helps them to counteract that a bit. The big payoff as a Warrior is when you are grouped with a good healer for dungeons/pvp or just for questing. They are in my experience also one of the most sought out classes for raiding guilds, 5mans and PvP.
---
Druids are very mobile and very flexible. They can easily remove slows/roots, have dash, charge and some good CC abilities. That in combination with their strong HoTs makes them super hard to kill. There are many cool specs for Druid and each of them lets you fulfill 2 roles formidably (tank/melee dps, tank/healer, caster dps/healer), with an appropriate gear swap in raids. Outside of raids you are always a true hybrid. In vanilla they are less shoehorned into just one role than in later expansions.

Demon Hunter in classic confirmed by box art
---
I finished the first book into the mistborn series and was hooked. I'm currently reading book two, then on a whim I bought Way of Kings since it's been recommended to me by a lot of people. I'm loving the world building so far.
---
Oh don’t worry, I’m still killing myself over one episode per week! :P Haha thanks very much for the kind words, I’ll be having a relaxing beer with them this weekend!
---
And still people keep spouting the same nonsense while having done zero research.
---
I also have what looks like a Crest symbol as well as a large black and white "blizzard" name on the same page. My webpage kept flashing the symbols and I managed to stop the page loading to get a couple pictures. Tinfoil hats?
---
That's a neat % you got there
---
Hehe ye, it was all fun though. We played a ton of instances together and eventually did some 2v2 arena which I guess were in TBC.
---
Follower
---
Well the Hordes blood runs through me forever! Also because I'm reading another book and decided to have her make the pair.
---
Kill the horde
---
I feel you, fearthepib.  Bank those losses, and she grows ever more overconfident.  And thus she births her own doom.....
---
Wait, what was that?  She played the "nookie" trump card?!?  Curses!  To wit:  I once threatened to grow a beard, and insisted that nothing she said would deter me.  Then she spoke these words:  "You can grow that beard, my dear -- but you ain't gonna get no nookie."
---
Needless to day, I remained clean shaven.  And she's held that card ever since.
---
For the horde!
---
Well I sort of understand but that just means you'd like to have a horde paladin because that's what you're used to playing, which isn't a real reason in reality.
---
You just gotta accept a new  experience and try something different. Literally any other class will outperform the paladin anyway. Just roll a prot warrior if you want to tank.
---
Why a 60-Hz monitor though? The best thing you can do to make classic look and feel great is a 144hz/1440p/IPS monitor. You can fit that into your budget, spending that extra money on the monitor will increase your experience 10x more than wasting money on a laptop or i7 CPU or whatever.
---
she wants to be a cute night elf, you will live horde boy just suck it up 
---
just play human and pretend your playing some sort of undead prequel
---
YES! They seem like a good idea, but I feel like I'm penalized for not doing them every day. It made each day a chore. Back in Vanilla I set myself a goal (like AV exalted to get pig stick) and worked towards it. That's how it should be; pick your own 'daily' grind.
---
I only roll PvP servers, as they are much spicier.
---
Thanks! I bought mistborn a long time ago and never read it until just recently. After I finished the first book I bought Way of Kings on a whim. It's honestly peer pressure from my co workers and friends.
---
Hey, what are you, off-brand me?
---
You couldn't roll horde and alliance on the same server? Wow, I like the design behind that choice. 
---
unwife her, corpsecamp till she quit and realizes horde is the superior faction. 
---
seek out true wifey material in top raiding guild on hordeside and build up a new, hopefully better, life.
---
How are 3 classes you can't hope to kill not a counter? I mean a rogue can blind/sprint/vanish away from virtually every fight - does that mean they have no counters as well? 
---
&gt;I just can not imagine a scenario where a skilled druid who knows how to powershift, switch forms, etc. and is equally geared to his opponent can not come out victorious or make it a tie
---
Well at naxx gear level a druid is very weak. Bis geared mages and warriors will usually beat a druid, in fact I'd say they are the single weakest class in full bis gear. I'm not sure there's a single class you could actually beat in a duel when everyone's in bis gear.
---
For a progression guild, not really. 4 hours is a bit over inflated anyway for 20 pummelers. But it was for sake of argument. You have a whole week to prepare for raids unless your guild sucks, that's like 30 min a day, so what else you gonna do. You gonna be pretty underachieving playing less than 4 hours a day. And that 4 hours is saved by not having to wait on any dungeon group since you can perform all roles really well, lvl faster than almost anyone but hunters. And require to farm less bis gear.
---
You only look at the 4 hours (which is more like 2 hours) but neglect what other classes have to do. Time saved on other stuff. Anyway if you don't farm one thing or the other in wow you gonna be a nobody stomped over by any dedicated players. That's just wow classic, sure you can play it casually but I wouldn't do it on a pvp server and still get wrecked in BGs.
---
Again not saying how you should play just what to expect and all factors not just the amount of time it takes getting the pummelers. 
---
Felhunter 
---
Phone auto corrected it to that...wtf
---
You must be new here...
---
Appreciate your in-depth analysis on this and your help in keeping this alive I think there maybe an error in what you said is how it should work in vanilla but it may just be my tired brain not understanding correctly
---
In vanilla you could go from a two-hander to dual wield in one gcd and change stances or go from 1 set of dual wield weapons to a to a different set of dual wield weapons
---
Is this different from "A GCD that is started by equipping a weapon during combat, causes no other weapons to be able equipped until the GCD has completed." I believe it would be allowed by "Any weapon swap can take place during a cast and causes no GCD." though.
---
Please post your analysis in the official classic wow forums and take the upvote you more than earned.
---
Then it's time to try something new, or play Alliance. If you don't like those options, retail is there waiting for you. 
---
Yeh you say that then they introduced the shitty azerite system and the artifact power system before that. Both systems punish players for ignoring them earlier in the expansion. At least artifact power level really didn’t matter by late expansion. Now if you played before the last patch then came back after it you can get azerite gear requiring more BS grinding. Modern wow has a lot of check this off my list shit and it makes the game feel a lot more forced than it used to be. Used to login see what your friends were up to maybe join them maybe go do your on thing. Now you login after 3 days off it’s go do 12 daily quest you’ve done 100 times or more for the daily rewards you missed. 
---
i cried 
---
Oh my god, she is a Night Elf player.
---
The humiliation.
---
There is nothing worse than Night Elf players.
---
I think it would completely ruin the lore/immersion and class identity. Please remind yourself that the Sunwalkers had not yet surfaced and that the Dwarves in Ironforge are still not too keen on befriending the Wildhammer Clan.
---
My girlfriend sounds similar to your wife in this case.
---
When I still played an vanilla classic server I once jokingly asked her “Hey you wanna play with me and drink a bottle of wine”
---
Unexpectedly she said “sure if you really want to”
---
So in seconds I whipped out my laptop got a bottle of wine and we started playing. (Normally I never drink wine)
---
To be honest when playing she seemed a bit overwhelmed by the game. It was more complicated for her then I thought it would be. I didn’t enjoy it so much. A few days later she said “hey you wanna drink some wine and play that game again?” But I said no thanks.
---
I think the thing she cared about the most was us having a drink together.
---
Maybe your experience would be better. But I just felt like sharing mine with you. 
---
There's also an element of "if I admit this previous version is good, I might as well admit the current version that I play isn't as good". A lot of retail players view the success of Classic or private servers as an attack upon their game of choice.
---

---
You don’t want to sell me death sticks.
---
You want to go home and rethink your life.
---
That was definitely one of my top ideas, especially if I can get my hands on a pet with stealth as well and be able to jump people in world pvp
---
The first year if Classic was way more fun. It is what most remember and acclaim.
---
For those who played at launch, I can imagine that the first half of classic was much better than the second half. Classic spanned about two years. I sorta left about a year in. I mean look the first year was amazing, but apparently the classic servers are launching at 1.12? I think that patch came out a bit before tbc? Not totally sure why they don't just release the patches in order.
---
The second half of Classic was kind of dull from what I have experienced on private servers. Theres no new dungeons and AQ is kinda lame. Then you have naxxramus, which basically nobody even did back in the day, which was probably a good thing considering how overpowered the gear was.
---
Alot of players who joined WoW during the second half just leveled characters, they didn't do end game. I am just sort of wondering if there is gonna be major burnout after BWL is over. Blizzard was obviously focusing their attention on TBC, which is why there was such little content added after the first half of Classic. There is like farming in Silithus I guess? Weather effects? Dishonorable kills? I just think this is something that the community tends to overlook a bit. You read this subreddit and basically all the content discussed relates to the first half of Classic. Sure that initial rush with reaching 60, Onyxia, UBRS, ZG,MC BWL is exciting, but after that what really is there? It was kind of boring for many players after that. Battlegrounds were also cross realm, and the content sort of catered towards raiding guilds. It was kind of bizarre in hindsight. Basically what I am getting at, is that I'd love to see Karazhan.
---
Her comment that horde races are ugly is the exact reason why blood elves were developed for the horde.
---
How is creating dailies taking advantage anymore than any other feature designed to take advantage of those tendencies (like the leveling up animation)?
---
The only thing dailies do differently is restrict you from endlessly grinding in the hopes to save you from yourself. 
---
I'll tell you why, lolastrasz.  It's because we Horde take PRIDE in our faction.  We take pride in our leaders, in Thrall, in Sylvanus.  We take pride in our capital cities, in Orgrimmar, in Undercity, in ....ummm... whatever the name is of that Tauren high rise you don't visit after level 30 or so.
---
Yeah prob play warlock thats what I rolled in vanilla and bc
---
Gank away, it's the right thing to do
---
Yeah prob roll warlock since thats what i played in vanilla and bc
---
Strongest spec for 1vs 1 is soul link, group play is different, affliction is amazing for BGS, throwing dots everywhere, stepping back to life tap mana and go back in. 
---
Why not gank, corpse camp while sobbing "You made me do this to you!", then divorce?
---
Yo dawg, I heard you like unpopular opinions, so I have an unpopular opinion about your unpopular opinion. 
---
Holy Paladins bring heart, soul and healing
---
Gotta stay Horde! Lok'tar O'gar!
---
&gt; you can get a couple SP trinkets and global people at will in world pvp.  
---
Spellpower trinkets can't be activated at the same time. That was changed during ZG due to ToEP+ZHC, iirc.
---
I'll be relieved to play a game in general that isn't filled with gameplay mechanics blatantly meant to exploit addictive behavior. I mean I realize classic is obviously addictive but at least it feels like it was designed by game developers instead of some first year psych students trying an experiment.
---
Even though this doesn't pertain to me, I hugely appreciate and admire your thought out, personal response. Sounds like you've had fun mulling this over and are happy helping people out - maybe you should start a "I'll help you settle on a class" service! We get so many posts every day in that vein, I'm sure your insight would be valued.
---
Yeah, I heard something about that.  It's sad that Blizzard has chosen to pollute the Horde with elves.  At least they'll never introduce paladins, or allow Alliance to become shamans.  They'd never do anything like that!
---
I was like this until I gave alliance a try... it's really nice experiencing the game from another perspective, especially since you get to play with your wife. 
---
I prefer alliance nowadays but since most of my friends want to go horde, I will be making that sacrifice because this is an MMO and I would rather be having a good time with friends over playing whichever faction I prefer. If I was married and my wife played WoW too, the choice would be even easier, play with her.
---
Oh I was undead I dont go in for that loktar crap
---
You can always drop $15 (At the end of the day, it's just half a tank of gas, or 1 delivery meal :p), make a Shammy on one server and an alternative on another server... if you find yourself hooked and happy on one, keep it up, if not, drop the sub and pray for Chocolate (TBC classic, if that wasn't clear)

E) Play as a NE druid for the bear ERP potential.

It was, but that was changed fairly early, I think.
---
so droods takes almost twice as much damage... thx for providing more facts that droods are trash tier tanks for current raidtiers

You had med until you shamed the coolest city in WoW :(

That is reddit as an entire whole. You don't come to this site for discussion any more its all about the circle jerk. Reddit sucks now
---
My god did that smell good
---
[Natural Alignment Crystal](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19344) + [ZHC](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19950) I believe still stacked
---
Undead also, but I fully support our green-skinned friends.  
---
Hunter here: Silencing Shot's a biggie... but I'll do without! 
---
Trap launcher to some extent - though I prefer the feel/challenge of having to lay it locally over the QoL of the launcher (Vanilla in a nutshell there).
---
Same with me. I am an immigrant and was only in the country for 3 years when WoW came out. It solidified my English skills and taught me how to type better and faster than the typing classes did in school.
---
I'm the child of immigrants and grew up in a home that predominantly spoke my parents native tongue. Playing games I was able to immerse myself in English and learn it without being at a disadvantage. Playing games has expanded my vocabulary, helped my grammar, and accelerated the pace at which I learned the language. 
---
To add to that: for what it costs to level blacksmithing you could easily just buy BoE gear and level another profession. A server only needs 5 to 10 active blacksmiths per faction, whereas you could run a raid with 40 engineers and it would be useful because of sapper charges, green lenses of resistance, grenades, etc.
---
I just didn't do dailies because I didn't care about gold lol
---
Now that I'm older it might be different 
---
Yes they were in vanilla. I used one a couple of months ago levelling in TBC.  
---
It had a list of all nearby characters and you could put them on a watch or alert list and enter any notes against them. So I would be levelling in hellfire peninsula and it would say *Alert lvl 62 troll rogue Zyzz -&gt; Camped me in STV when he was higher level than me*  
---
The one I had was mainly for keeping track of enemy faction players. I'd imagine a same faction one would be much easier, or maybe not even worth doing considering you can just put them on friends list with a note in there.
---
Honestly I think dailies in modern wow serve 2 purposes:
---
firstly a way to inflate the active player numbers so they can show their shareholders "look we have X million daily active users" even though a lot of people are probably logging in for 45 minutes to do dailies then log off
---
and secondly a way to artifically gate content and stagger progress because certainly the current expansion is really light on content compared to older expansions. 
---
Both of these are super lame.
---
There's an argument for dailies to be for people to earn money, to catch up if they've been out of the game for a long time and get some easy good loot etc. I think that was possibly the idea at first, but we're now looking at like the Ray Kroc McDailies after all the fun and nice intentions were stripped back and its now just a fix in more ways than one.
---
\*shush\*, don't tell anyone, but I actually spied on the Alliance on the PServer Which Shall Not Be Named.  Disguised as a night elf, I leveled from 1 to 60.  Gonna have to give you that point, their leveling zones are a heck of a lot prettier than Durotar or The Barrens.  One would almost think that the Blizz devs had spent more time designing the Ally side as compared to the Horde. ..

It's not bait in the slightest. The quest was really personal for me as I have lost quite a few people in my life to cancer. I also find it genuinely heartwarming to see blizzard memorialize him in a way that people can still see 11 years later and in his own voice no less.  
---
I didn't understand how the client was getting built up, so I didn't know that that portion of the game simply did not exist. I hope this gets some traction to get added. 
---
I don't think there is any class that can just wear the exact same stuff in PvP and PvE. Stuff like Spirit etc. is much less important in PvP than it is in PvE but Stamina/Armor/Resistances are. For example the Tier 0.5 and the rare PvP set gives you much better bonuses and stats for PvP than Tier 2 as a comparison.
---
Also your spec will differ. As a PvP healer you want to grab as many defensive talents as you can. As a PvE healer you only care about healing efficiency.
---
But don't think that Priests are fodder in BGs. A well *played* Priest is very hard to kill.
---
Try playing the "nookie" trump card.  See my post above for details.

Was dropping from a group while in an instance that teleported you to your set hearth location regardless of your HS cooldown in Vanilla?

Saw a early post. A dudes wife beat him in a duel once. She never let go.
---
Sorry, but I have a weak stomach, and can't handle playing a gnome.  I'd vomit instantly upon seeing his horrible visage in the character selection screen.
---
The WOLTK pre-launch event was quite fun, it's a shame that Blizzard didn't really do anything like that afterwards.
---
You could play a pre-Forsaken (aka Human).  
---
Or, you could make her a Forsaken so she can be a human, too.  
---
Or faction change her most favorite toon to a Belf.
---
And the other character's name is that of a guild which did some world first kill on July 16th.
---
Honestly, your best best long term as a Warrior main is to power level a Hunter alt and get good at solo trib runs.
---
If it's possible in Classic, that is. Over time, you'll make so much more gold for a lot less hassle.
---
Ended way to early lol
---
Have her create a character on your account and take her time with everything.  Let her spend forever on the character creation screen if she wants.  Be patient and expect to spend a few hours each session just sitting next to her and coaching her. Let her take as long as she needs to get certain aspects down. 
---
I had stopped playing for a long time and one day just started reminiscing, reciting all the amazing things about the game to her. She is also a fantasy fan so that sparked the interest. I started playing again and convinced her to give it a try on my account if she wanted, without being pushy about it.  She started and didn’t want to stop; the only reason she doesnt play now is because my account isn’t active either. 
---
Unless you have a role set as a shadow priest in a raiding guild, your best bet of the three would be to go a resto shaman.
---
Agreed, my ex used to play pretty hardcore. The only "me-time" i had was gone, which kinda sucked. Having different hobbies is healthy imo. 
---
Did they?
---
Bloody Shaman!
---
My gf at the time rolled a hunter, then we flipped factions, and she rolled a Warlock and never looked back.
---
Good tanks are always needed so I'm sure some have no problem allowing you items or straight out pay you. But people with friends of course won't go for it.
---
Well warriors don't do to bad with the initial content. Arcanate reaper is solid. But yea you probably will get beaten by most classes of equal gear without a pocket healer. I mean sure depends on skill and knowledge of the class, but good rogues will beat you, sl/affliction warlocks, mages especiely, hunters unless you get lucky, druids with all their mobility... Shamans I think you have good chances unless the shaman gets lucky procs/crits...
---
during TBC i had to compete with my dad for playtime which sucked becuase he literally rode around (and eventually flew around) for hours on end farming mining nodes to get money for flying and epic flying.
---
i just wanted to level man
---
It's completely antithetical to what Vanilla is. Absolutely nooooooooooooooooooo.
---
I think the mage class trinket gem just like reduced your mana cost or something.
---
You don't choose Orc for pet damage but for their stun resistance, which is quite a big advantage in PvP.
---
\*\*ITS NOT SUMMER\*\*
---
Also, \*hype hype hype hupe hype hupe hype hupe\*  I also want it, but we know its not out.
---
Roll an alliance character, then join lots of BGs and be absolutely awful - do whatever you can to let Horde win; misreport incomings/EFC locations, pretend to AFK whenever alliance scum come near your flag, never help or heal anyone. You'll be our guy on the inside and we'll love you for it.
---
&gt; Gnomes believe in biological warfare.
---
Pure projection from the Forsaken.
---
Release date announcement needs to have 1 month and 1 day notice.

The real question is: should Death Knights be added before or after the Naxx comes out.
---
I got a good laugh out of your comment, -Atlan-!  Wit like yours is in short supply.
---
However, either character model would be vomit-inducing, and I lack the funds for shampooing the carpet in my study more than once a year.
---
Dont be afraid to try a class wich is said to be overpopulated. You can rogue and warrior and have fun. The secret of vanilla. Not all endgame is one single raid. 
---
I’m so glad I only found out about classic recently, these few months have been torture 😢
---
Well all of the scum encrusted girls play horde so looks like you got yourself a keeper. I’d suggest just joining the good side and putting your dark past behind you. 
---
Nah, it was actually amazing.
---
[Mind Quickening Gem](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19339)

Not quite as good as NAC for PvP, but still an amazing trinket. Especially for trolls who know when to use Berserking.
---
Mana bateries
---
As you have said yourself rage is gained from damage taken. In berserker stance the warrior takes 10% additional damage which results in a tiny bit more rage gained.
---
The formular is like so:  
---
Rage Gained = (Damage Taken) / (Rage Conversion at Your Level) \* 2.5
---
Rage Conversion at level 60: 230.6

Yeah, I did not notice a difference between warlock and Hunter. I leveled a mage on a private server and it felt extremely fast as well. Priest is also quite fast from my experience. Rogue felt the slowest. That's why I compared Hunter to rogue. 
---
Female Dwarf?
---
Fear ward
---
&gt; that Tauren high rise you don't visit after level 30 or so.
---
Well now you need to roll Alliance. Worst Horde member confirmed. 
---
You can Youtube gold farming for any class. Princess runs or dire maul is possible with warlock np. Warlocks are stronger for pvp imo but with raiding might want to go mage since the frost pve spec is decent for pvp as well and sl ruin isn't that great for pve in return. 
---
is she deciding to play with you or are you deciding to play along with her?
---
there are decent looking undead and troll female customizations, I'd put in more effort into convincing her. If you do join the 'sparkle goody two-shoes it's my fantasy to be pretty weenie hut jr club', will you be happy?
---
I'm thinking of playing a healer for the first time in raiding and going a dwarf priest. Probably the main tank healer. Glad to see you enjoyed it!
---
From my perspecive, I've largely played mage since Vanilla and have loved it. I love min-maxing and competing on meters. That said, for Vanilla, there weren't really rotations for mages and locks -- you'll be spamming the same spell and your damage will largely be reliant on gear and consumables. If you found paying shadow priest in MC boring, I'd imagine you could feel that way as most DPS.
---
dwarf priest, no question
---
Broke up with her....errrr i mean. Ask her politely to try playing.

I once saw a poster that showed a very attractive woman walking across a stage.  The poster also had a man sitting in a chair, watching her.  The caption read, "Behind every beautiful woman, there's a man who's tired of putting up with her sh--".

It's very useful even in pugs you can always heal warriors to benefit your team greatly, but 1vs 1 you are toast. 
---
Oh yeah me too. Never liked TBC Outland so I dont really want to have to transfer to TBC servers.
---
You gank that little NE wench until she can't walk anymore, then you do the same thin IRL later in bed  :)
---
Play on them same server. Break ToS to farm nodes or something. Killing the competition without leaving any in game evidence. *Insert 1, 2, profit meme I'm too lazy to create here*
---
Ice Fire and Arcane? pfftt. Join the true masters of the elements!

I could swear has was in one of your episodes too... My bad!
---
I use a SIM card modem and it’s fine for gaming.  Ping matters more than download speed for games - you’ll be fine with 40 ping.  It just takes a long time to download stuff.
---
You can get all your pre raid gear from 5 mans in about 2-3 weeks after hitting 60. Even if you're missing few pieces, they'll get filled with raid gear soon enough. And it's really not that difficult to get into 5 mans if you're in a half decent guild.
---
You'll be farming gnomer even after MC, when no other class has any use for mans anymore.
---
That "extra 30 minutes" every day could be spent doing things that are actually fun, or even thing that don't involve sitting in front of the computer. 30 minutes per day adds up really quick.
---
You'll still have to farm the same amount of consumables as any other class, so this just adds even more time to that.
---
If you're willing put up with all that, then by all means, more power to you, I'm not here to tell you how to spend your time. 
---
But you're trying to make it sound like farming pummelers is not time consuming at all and everyone should have time for it. 
---
Hey, don't knock RAF.  I still dualbox with the two seater flying mounts today.  And have like 6 accounts that were never used for more than a month.
---
Roll a pally to play with her. 
---
Then also roll your preferred class on Horde and relentlessly gank her until she switches faction. 
---
No, this is peasant shit right here. The only legitimate use for a steam link is a wall mounted articulating monitor and a keyboard desk on for your bathroom. Server first 60 aint got no time for shitting.
---
Cities have high lvl players as well, better to gank in SV or tarrens mill. City and high lvl player will find you unless you are super lucky. Especiely hard vs alliance with the human racial. You might kill a few but then you are toast.
---
Go druid for World pvp, best class for that. Can tank, heal, dps with all the mobility. 
---
One of the (among many others) reasons I do not want TBC.
---
I didn't have to. My significant other already plays retail.
---
They're gonna give Classic a try when it's out.
---
*"Dwarf women can't grow beards."*

This alone makes me glad I'm unhindered going Horde.
---
If you're experience with prot pally is wrath and beyond...you're not gonna like Classic prot pally
---
By #Changes, I'm referring to the movement to have post-Naxx content patches instead of TBC servers.
---
With that amount of time to play, I would skip warrior. Nightmare to level that slowly.
---
I agree, I'm a school teacher and children always gawk in amazement at how quickly I can type without looking at the screen (to them, in reality it's about 110wpm). They always inquire about how I learned and I always just reply "lots of time spent indoors" 
---
It's a Parisian thing. On the whole the French are a warm welcoming people, but Parisians are a different breed. I lived in Paris for 2 yrs, and whenever someone detected a scent of a foreign accent when I spoke, they'd also switch to terrible English (and probably try to charge me more). Also having lived there for 2 yrs I made loads of them, but not a single one was  Parisian, plenty of Magrebs, plenty of expats, but not a single Parisian....
---
There is also a big thing in France around preserving the integrity of the French language as a matter of pride, which I sort of understand, but they take it too far.  The Académie française in particular consider themselves as the "official custodians of the French language" creating their own versions of words like Internet and Sandwich to "preserve the integrity of the language". 
---
As a Horde or nothing player I am happy to see that divorce is on the table
---
I guess? Idk. Seems like looking a gift horse in the mouth, to have a hot WoW wife and not want to play the same faction as her.
---
Oh yeah that one was awesome! I still have that necklace that makes the ghost follow you around from the WotLK launch.
---
I know Cata isn't very popular but I thought the launch event was fun. I remember being SO happy when Deathwing finally showed up to murder me while I was out picking flowers. BC was definitely my favorite though.
---
Well, as stated, I dont mind slow leveling at all. I enjoy questing tbh. 
---
^(Sylvanus pre-Warchief)
---
Agreed!
---
Sounds like you should go mage.  Mages can farm gold so well that respeccing really isn't that big of a deal for them.  You can farm gold as a mage in your raid spec too btw, just not as efficiently but still better than most.  Warlocks can farm gold really well too, but it sounds like if you roll Warlock you will regret it.
---
Hunter dps, druid powershifting and rogue timing is not that easy at all. Healing is much less timing dependant. Don't underestimate what good dps has to do.

You shouldn't have any issue with finding a raid spot healing.  Bear tanks are almost noon existent in raids but in 5 man's they are very good.  I recommend being a tank to start your 60 journey and pick up healing pieces until you have half a set before swapping to heals.  With the lack of ressurect an undergeared druid healer is almost never wanted for dungeons.
---
Sorry but there is some misinformation here and the guy above is mixing stuff up about Druids.
---
Flag carrier Druids are mostly *not* pure ferals, but resto (healing) specced or tank/healing hybrid specced. If you snatch the flag against good players you won't be getting away without Nature's Swiftness, no + healing gear and just a single Rejuv ticking on you.
---
You don't have time to autoattack a ton when people start to pile up on you. All you care about is movement and survival.
---
This also means you  won't be 2 shotting "any cloth". And even if you would spec feral you won't be doing that except you are heavily overgeared and juiced up or you have some incredible crit luck. Also that is not a Druids strength or even job in PvP. Leave the zerging to warriors/mages/priests etc. Survivability, mobility, utility, crowd control, those are your strengths.
---
Also do you know why Druids get stealth detect on PvP gear? Because Rogues are your worst enemy.
---
Sorry.
---
Holy priest will be easy to get a group. You'll still have to wait for the tank to come though. You will be a slow leveler and quester solo. Mages get groups pretty easily as well. Good damage Cc and some group perks. Much better leveling and solo experience. If you mostly want to be doing dungeons I'd go priest. If you think you'll spend more time lone wolfing it around Azeroth I'd go mage.
---
I've had tons of fun on the Retro WoW private server.
---
It starts you off at level 60, with all the blue dungeon gear available from vendors in the designated starting area. 
---
The raids are scaled down to 5 man, so if you got a friend or two interested in playing you should be able to have alot of fun. 
---
Its far from the perfect vanilla experience, but its a great opportunity to try different classes and specs at max level.

You are already dead.

Alliance warlocks have a different role then horde side.  Ally locks are more burst oriented since pallys cannot burst.

I was originally leaning towards option D. but yes, divorce and gank
---
You'd be surprised. Look at the Onyxia comment above. That thing comes in cluch once in a while 
---
Rogues are cowards 
---
And thats why we don’t die 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Problem with shaman is that only healing is viable in pve until you get enough gear that fights don't last long enough for you to go oom. In pvp they are pretty damn good. But switching specs all the time sucks. 
---
the h is silent.  
---
Not even a 7 day notice? rip
---
Everyone wants at least 1 mage in dungeon.
---
Demand is huge, mage is beast. Period.
---
If you play it good, you will find groups and raids.
---
I never minded dailies. I only played through WotLK so I’m not aware of what dailies are like in current wow. 
---
Ghetto hearthing
---
That's so true about vocab improvement!  I just took the GRE a few months ago.  I scored very highly (on verbal at least... lol), and I didn't particularly study or anything.  I just know a fuck-ton of words from Everquest and WoW.   I always get excited and nostalgic when I see them irl, also.   "The Revenant" movie made me think of an armor set from EQ.  Anytime something is described as "arcane," etc. :D
---
Thank you for the input! 
---
You could, if you were willing to pay for and maintain 2 separate accounts.  On the same account, on a PVP server, you couldn't have two factions.
---
Some of the "king pin" players had more than two accounts, paid for their vent server(s), and even helped out some of their guildmates with their monthly fees.  I think it was one of the top American MT who couldn't pay his monthly fee and was helped out.
---
What? 
---
As a woman who played “ugly” horde characters since vanilla, the reason I went with this side was because my friends were Horde, then I grew hating alliance because i got ganked a lot while questing, Also I love the lores!  
---
You can definitely try to convince her!  Let her play few undead or female troll characters then she will grow to love the horde! 
---
It's true, shaman have 1 more spell type so they are superior. It's just math people.
---
I used to play on my friends account and he had a night elf Hunter with Rhok delar and full dragonstalker, I remember absolutely destroying people. As a hunter it's so easy to get away and restealth and eat/drink. 
---
It was super fun, and the fact that hunters are one of the only classes to actually use their tier gear is pretty important to me aswell.
---
If you're both planning to play the game long term, could you no just have a character on each faction?
---
As someone who also rolled alliance because the horde was ugly, your wife is absolutely right and I applaud her good tastes. Please reconsider your life choices, ugliness is a sin.
---
In all seriousness though I got good laugh out of this! My husband and I went through the same thing in vanilla and now again with classic. Good luck to you guys I hope you're able to find a happy compromise!
---
PvE will be popular on both servers -- even hardcore PvPers will want to raid for certain gear.
---
Keep the dog, ditch the wife.  :)
---
yeah?
---
1. I play horde, no comment.
---
2. I'm not sure if the amount of rage you receive is calculated before or after the damage mitigation/bonus from stances. You might be thinking of the Berserker Rage ability, which according to the tooltip, grants additional rage when you are hit by an enemy. I don't know the details of how that is calculated, but it's not very significant iirc.
---
Rogue druid is very strong. Stealth and open up on some poor soul and good vs 2 or 3 people at once. Rouge brings the cc and damage and druid the tanking and healing, requiring a good group to beat the due because the druid can just kite or tank as the rogue kills them, or dps and heal if your rogue body is being attacked. 
---
&gt; Ive got to play something I dont enjoy or not play at all
---
There's your answer.  
---
I'm with ya.  Got to level 56!  As a NE huntard!  First TIME!
---
Dont forget about dwarves unleashing the end of the world via BRM
---
THE H IS SILENT  
---
The option is obvious. 
---
e) Turn your wife into an alliance double agent. Have her infiltrate the very social fabric of the Alliance on your server. Use her to plot alliance movement and Alliance raid nights. Use the neutral AH to funnel hard to get items to one another, and grow rich. And finally, start a Horde guild and *gank.* With your wife spying, you can snipe raids, ruin world bosses, camp resources...simply, take over the world (of warcraft)!
---
&gt;Thankfully nowadays my life is so empty that I welcome the addiction of Classic.
---
I second that.
---
Yeah I completely forgot about the drop rate !

They say it's 40% on [http://classicdb.ch/?item=9449](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9449)

Your 4 hours just became 10 hours in average. I hope you don't raid every day !!! \^\^
---
If it was BOE there would be a great market for them.
---
mine was when I have got the full Shadowcraft gear and 2 epic daggers , I went against someone talking mad crap about beating people in IF outside of course. He was another rogue in full T2 and epics, I remember he opened up on me and I managed to get out of it and both unstealthed running at eachother I ended up jumping turning my char 180 to show my back as his move to gouge...his mistake, when he turned around after I BS, cheapshot stun lock, vanish, ambush, dead. 
---
dude couldn't believe it...but that jump show ur back trick saved me a lot of times. 
---
I can't hear you over all this awesome flipping I'm doing.
---
I'm a native English speaker, but WoW taught me how to type.  I did Mavis Beacon at school but hated it and was terrible at it. It wasn't until MMO's like WoW that I was forced to learn how ot type fast.
---
look at it this way. whenever you would want to take a break from your wonderful wife and play some WoW, she would still be there. there would be no escape. sometimes its good to have different hobbies.
---
I see, but why wait until after naxx to make changes
---
While leveling you can just stick to shadow as a priest - while still being able to heal dungeons somewhat comfortably if you want to
---
We've always had dailies.  They just didn't have a quest marker or time gates attached to them.  Much better design imo.  In classic we will be able to grind like hell on a day off work to get stuff done and actually feel like we are progressing in the game.
---
Daily quests are the pinnacle of scum design.  Some have purpose here and there as extra bits to do, but in general the entire concept is way overused, especially if they are used as key progression points.  Even more scummy in a pay-to-play game.  Like, I'm paying your company to allow myself the opportunity to experience your game, the least they can do is come up with some engaging content.
---
Unless I make a complete u-turn and roll a paladin, I will be horde :p
---
But I will still need it if I want to farm stranglekelp.
---
Lol this is a wonderful comment
---
Only noob friendly guilds will take resto shamans without mana tide, just stuff to expect. 
---
Poison cleansing totem and tremor totem tho 
---
If experiencing the other side is a consideration for you, as it clearly is, I'd go Alliance. It's renewing to see the game from the otherside.
---
I played through Wrath as Alliance and since Cata as Horde and it's great to see both sides.
---
Demon hunters can fly
---
Berserker Barrage! 
---
A good shaman can turn the tables on a rogue. They have lots of tools. A prepared and unnoticed rogue can get a shaman too. It's anyone's game.
---
I mained alliance forever and am going horde to duo-level with my roommate cause wants horde. Suck it up and play with her if she wants to chill with you in game
---
I'd be happy with a black screen with a wow classic logo and a date.
---
If your wife only wants to play PvE you'd have a simple solution of not being on the same server at all! :-P
---
Iirc it's just a CSS error that occasionally pops up. Has been happening for years on other blizzard forums.
---
It's great in PvP, near useless in raiding (aside from buffing warlocks).
---
No offense to OP, but he never mentioned she was hot.
---
1. Yes, but you will very rarely downrank FoL because rank 6 is so cheap to begin with. (+Illuminate)
---
Likewise, rolling on an RP server especially, i was struggling hard to just keep up with everyday chit chat.   
---
I was lucky to play with patient people, who didn't mind me taking a few minutes to put together a coherent sentence, once you got into it and started meeting new people you also increase your typing speed aswell as your vocabulary on a daily basis.
---
Thanks for the content.  We can all hope that great talent like Kevin find their place in our evermore corporatized industry.

It took a long time for us.  First my girlfriend started watching me play heroes of the storm, then I got her into twitch, then she discovered some wow streamers with good personalities to follow, then I brought her into retail to level some lowbie tunes and really walk her through it, then I built her a gaming pc so she could play right next to me, then I purchased the game for her and away we go now she raids retail every week and this week I got her on a private classic server practicing leveling routes.  I would say it took a full expansion before she got comfortable.  She got in around end of WoD so there was not a ton going on and it was a good training environment.  She was very much a newb all through legion but then she went all out for BFA and is a pretty hardcore raider.  Every step of the way if she was not having fun we stopped or tried something else.  Also had her play some single player RPGs and action titles that got her deeper into gaming concepts.  She is a very girly girl type....hot blonde American girl.  I never thought I would get her to this point but now she is super passionate and even went to two Blizzcons with me.  Good luck!

Human warlock kills rogues easy with the racial and felhunter out you see rogues miles away. If they can't open up on you they are super easy to kill WotF or not. SL warlocks are the strongest class for 1vs 1 pvp in the game and still good in grps.
---
Mages while strong get melted by locks and spriest. 
---
There's just one huge issue with this.
---
There will be sharding and a limited amount of servers which means that most grind spots for valuable stuff will be camped 24/7.
---
That means some people will have to find an entirely different way to make gold.
---
People hear what they want to hear and see what they want to see...

I'd like to piggy back on this to ask a question about BWL &amp; NAX recommendations.  I have watched a handful of videos dissecting the potential damage output of hunters post MC, and the consensus is clear.  My question is more theorycrafting - but is there an opportunity to prioritize talents &amp; stats that would allow for a 'spell power' hunter of sorts?  I understand that white damage is the bulk of overall damage, just curious if it is/was possible in Vanilla.   
---
Or just don't fear undead at all, rather use immolate and with two dots on top just tank them with SL until they they. SL warlocks are beasts in pvp. 
---
Slam warrior. 
---
This is literally what I'm going through. I played both, prefer ally, dumb friends want to play horde. Guess it might be fun to see how the shaman instead of paladin plays out in raids since I never raided as horde.
---
Both tanks and healer druids are more than viable options, don't pay too much attention to the min-maxers. Even dps druids can find raid spots, if you are good enough. One of the first guilds on a certain undocumented server to clear Naxx had a balance druid in their core raid group.
---
Min-maxers are basing their numbers on what the best people within respective classes are capable at doing, which is not even representetive for what the average player is gonna amount to. Another point is that if you don't enjoy what you play, you are most certainly gonna do a worse job even if you are super chad warrior masterclass.
---
Now I want to play an Orc rogue! 
---
Thanks! Bub!
---
Yeah, he started as Avatar and he was a legend among early Vanilla hunters because he had a fucking Vis'kag and a Felstriker. Lmao, total waste. Anyway, during server x-fers when his guild Corp Hur abandoned him so he changed his name to Serennia and joined 1 of my old guilds, Drama. There he played with some of my IRL friends, including my old healer, Tigerlady. The legend of Serennia continued because of all the shiesty shit he did like disbanding multiple rank1 arena teams and stealing people's Ipods etc. Psychopathy aside, he was a legitimately good player and definitely wasn't trolling in his video, he was whooping people's asses: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvx1sJyXhBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvx1sJyXhBg) It was just early in his, and everyone else's, WoW career so there was still a lot of room left for improvement. In the years following this video he obviously got way better and I'm sure he ended up binding all his keys(especially since switching to warrior would require way less binds than hunter) but at the time he filmed this video he certainly wasn't bad compared to everyone else.  
---
And I'm not trying to say that backpedaling and clicking wasn't bad, just that early on in the game there were many other more basic ways that players could be bad in. I mean I went over to one of my IRL friends' houses and found him playing warrior without ever switching stances because no1 told him to, lmao. Today the average player is almost automatically taught all those basics through exposure to a more skilled community. Plus, early on, there were almost no videos of truly mechanically skilled players. Hell, it took digging through forums to even find videos of bad players just teaching people the most basic shit. So anyone just using all of their skills, a mouse, and some key binds had an advantage. And the players with fast reactions probably didn't stand out yet because they were busy learning the basics like everyone else and didn't think of shit like quick taunting a hunters pet before stepping into his freezing trap, or using the skull of doom.
---
It's crazy to see what the game has become, how the meta has evolved over the years. Classic should be wild this time around.
---
Given your outspoken willingness to kill me, I am not exactly your biggest fan rn
---
You could always just stock up on Noggenfoggers and pretend to be undead. Dunno how you'll make peace with slaughtering your fellow Hordies though.
---
Lvling pretty decent. Wolf Form is great, amazing in pvp if played well. Managing totems properly and the shocks at perfect timing is key. 
---
There are plenty of very attractive women that play video games nowadays tbh. Having a mindset that you'd be so lucky to be with any of them is how you get none of em lol.
---
Think of yourself higher homie.
---
Spite her. Divorce her and play alliance live to win.
---
There are four different ways to auto attack?
---
Mages will be really common. Most players don't really do take part in such threads I think. 
---
Hi, looking for friends.
---
His Caer Darrow art is awesome.
---
I like your dumb math days, always an entertaining read. 
---
I know nothing (John Snow is that you ?) about pallies but isn't shockadin the endgame raiding spec ?
---
Now you know the DPS of each spec, you should calculate how much time each spec would take to lvl 60, assuming grinding but don't forget to account for drinking !
---
I too quit after hitting 85 and I find it odd how many players were in the same boat. There wasn't a major change in the game or its mechanics, and yet, I had absolutely zero motivation to play any longer. The immersion seemed to have broken.
---
I remember hating the underwater questlines that came with Cataclysm, and to be honest nothing was memorable about Cataclysm's levelling in a good sense. It was very dull, and nothing got me interested in the lore of Deathwing or any of the events of the expansion.
---
You stole my comment...
---
Why don´t you say see you on the battlefield?
---
I just don't find it difficult to press buttons in a predefined way. There is almost no variability at all. The classes I played the most are Hunter, Druid and Priest (mostly shadow). And no, their rotations aren't challenging. Because they are "rotations".
---
Yes with some DPS classes you have to be a bit more attentive, but healing is much more timing dependand because their timing is variable and dynamic, unlike DPS rotations.
---
Just roll Alliance with her. I've never understood the obsession people have with certain factions. I mean it's cute, but you're a grown man, haha. Also, if you've always played Horde, it's worth switching it up to see the game from the other side anyway.
---
Yes!! Relatable!
---
Mind if I ask which one you use and which provider you are on? Does it work better than a jetpack (if you’ve tried a jetpack)?
---
Well there's certainly no shortage of fun in \[classic\] WoW!
---
Was pretty sold on either Mage or Priest, but I feel like there’s going to be so many of them, it’ll be harder to get a raid spot/gear. Feel like maybe Warlock/pally are more desirable alternatives, but I have so little interest playing them. 
---
I'm torn between Warrior and Rogue. I'm looking to focus on PvE dps. My biggest issue is gold farming potential. I know how Rogues can farm, but how do warriors make their gold? I'm looking to be mining/engineer on whichever I choose. 
---
Did you create that specific build yourself or did you look at an online guide? I have a feeling you did it yourself. 
---
For leveling, I'd say go with the SW:P talents. You'll get more mana efficiency, which will reduce your downtime. You won't need the hit until later. 
---
You won't know until you try, you'll know at some point between 20 and 30 if it's right for you 
---
Sad face, I don't charge at all but still don't have any business going.  I'm jealous
---
It sounds like you two are discussing two separate specs for druid. One is more damage focused, another is more healing focused. It is more intuitive that the healing focused spec would perform better in FCing. 
---
I have like 30 of these
---
Too Few:
---
1. **Healers Shaman/Paladin**
---
2. Healers Priest/Druid
---
3. Tanks
---
Too Many:
---
1. Melee DPS Rogues/Warriors
---
How about it, heathen? Join the light of the Alliance. Leave behind the savage ways or the Horde. Join us, raise steel, and strike down our enemies with the strength of lions.
---
Lol @ option (C).  I just pictured you as undead rogue (classic ganksters) just stunlocking her mercilessly.   Which would obviously lead to being the victim of (A).
---
But brotha.  I have a deep love of the Tauren, but I can NOT play Horde.  Which would I prefer in my capital city:
---
(1) Cobblestones and warmly lit alleys, castles and cathedrals, cozy taverns, towering statues of stone, a quaint "old city" district, a spiraling mage's tower, a dusty and thriving dwarven district surrounding the Golden Keg alehouse.
---
Or
---
(2) Some squat huts.  A barracks with a red thatched roof.  More wooden hovels everywhere you look.
---
I have to agree with your wife that Vanilla WoW Horde was damn ugly. That's why they had to add in the Blood Elves and later add in a "pretty" face for the Female Troll.
---
But I vote option E - find your inner love for the Alliance and play with her on that side. I've played Horde for most of my WoW career but played enough Alliance as well that I can appreciate it.
---
Besides, in Classic I'll be going Alliance as well for the more attractive races lol. 
---
We're talking about Druid in whole nobody asked for a specific spec
---
Question about Improved Shadow Word Pain - for **LEVELING**, would you take the extra two ticks (+6 seconds) or rather take 5/5 for Shadow Focus (+10% hit).  
---
Can't hope to kill? How does a warrior or rogue even catch a druid in the first place? Mage is good, but druid can outlast them as well. There are no players of the exact same skill and all classes have ways, just some advantages here and there. Warlock is probably the hardest for druids, but then warlocks best anyone 1vs1. First everything depends on skill, next consumables and engeneering, then class choice. 
---
You spend a *lot* of time with your characters just getting to 60. Play what you like. If you're stuck between priest and mage, I'd say priest. You can DPS and priests are the defacto healer, so you will always be able to find a group. 
---
The lagging out in combat and Barrens chat bits were gold.
---
I didn't even remember the underwater stuff but you mentioning it does sound familiar.  I mained druid anyway though so breathing underwater was already a thing I could do :D
---
&gt; I know nothing (John Snow is that you ?) about pallies but isn't shockadin the endgame raiding spec ?
---
Shockadin has always been a fairly niche memespec (outside of TBC 5v5 arena. 5 shockadins = immortal team) - Later game (T2) it's a pretty viable PVP spec due to damage + healing plate and set bonuses - but most raiding specs opt out of holy shock because it's not a good healing spell.
---
B then C
---
Troll women ugly? PSH. 
---
Uhm, yes. If i got a cent for every woman who calls gaming waste of time but spends all free time watching serials, bobby kotick would be my butler long time ago.
---
Tricky my dude.  I use T-Mobile, but the unlimited hotspot feature it needs to work is no longer available.  :( 
---
I use a Netgear cellular modem
---
Ok thanks.  In classic, do you know what the base hit chance is to hit mobs 2 levels higher than you?  Trying to figure out my miss rate.    
---
I found this page, but it appears outdated:
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow\_Focus](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Focus)
---
&gt; ~~bastardized~~ highly evolved trolls
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Play what you like and have her play what she likes.  Play in the same room and enjoy each other's company while playing the game you both love so much.
---
Well if that doesn't make me a sad panda. I'm still not going to take my hat off though...
---
If option C is truly out of the question...
---
I say give Alliance a go. I myself have primarily always been an Alliance player, however later on in my WoW career I rolled Horde and got a Mage all the way to 80 (WotLK), and I had a blast because I got to try out all these new zones and cities I otherwise never got to experience prior.  **Tl;dr:** It's fun to try new things. Give it a shot.
---
Also, to second /u/GnomeWarlock69: 
---
&gt; Youre lucky enough to have a gal that will play wow with you.  Suck it up and play alliance. 
---
You have a wife. That will play WoW with you. The significance of this cannot be understated.
---
Back in Vanilla time, a colleague of a friend was playing Saga Of Ryzom and convinced his girlfriend to play.
---
She became addicted to the game (he was too).
---
Their house became a mess, they cut contact with IRL friends, my friend only knew about this because the guy was still coming at work and telling him about it.
---
It lasted about a year, then the boyfriend started to loose interest in the game and was trying to convince the GF to play less.
---
However she had met someone while roleplaying, they even married in game.
---
A few months later she was quitting her BF to go live with the roleplayer ... I don't know what happened after that.
---
My own build.  Seems pretty optimal to me, except the choice between SW:P and Shadow Focus.  
---
time for a divorce 
---
This is Classic. Use the right meme format, peasent.
---
Deal breaker imo. 
---
DIVORCE IS THE ONLY OPTION.
---
I loved how the dungeons weren't brain-dead aoe fests that you rushed to complete in .8 seconds. That is, until people cried enough and they nerfed those too.
---
I’m at a similar dilemma - plan on playing with a friend who has always played Horde. I’m Alliance all the way at heart but in later expansions switched a couple of times to play with friends who were Horde. Now for Classic, he said he would be happy to play Alliance and experience the other side, but then changed his mind and said he’s gonna go for a nostalgia trip and roll Horde. I completely understand that, but then what do I do? I really love the Alliance side of the story, quests, and zones, and I hate Horde scum!
---
Another Gorefiend guy here -- was in Eclipsed on alliance side back in the day
---
Roll need on everything, make us proud 
---
That's not Classic, good sir.
---
Makes sense, but why not use fear?
---
Dailies were the death of Classic and the birth of retail imo
---
He was joking...?
---
I played both dps and heal on very high lvl and found both demanding if used to full effectiveness. Watching your position, threat meter and getting the timings off perfectly is no easier or harder than the same thing healer does. I think you have some subjective opinions about dps for personal reasons tbh. If you talk mage and warlock/spriest dps I agree. But feral druids, rogues and hunters require just as much attention as healing. Adding to that, if you have a great raid team healing is even easier because you will rarely have o shit moments and just fill the empty bars up. Please do respect both sides for their effort and don't throw in shit dps in the same group. Or even worse thinking healing makes you superior to dps. 
---
&gt; just play human and pretend your playing some sort of undead prequel
---
Lmao I love this
---
"... but I know what ***love*** is"...?
---
UDPATE: So I found this.  Looks like all I need is +6% so 3/5 for Shadow Focus.  Good to go!
---
[https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Spell\_Hit\_Chance](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_Hit_Chance)
---
 *If the target is +2 levels compared to caster: 94%*  
---
Too few: priest paladin and shaman healers. Usually short on warlocks.
---
Too many: hunter, rogue, mage.
---
So was I...?
---
You can’t and won’t. It will be different , new and special all the same. 
---
I've yet to watch a single video Madseason has made that I  do not like. His content is great.
---
Yeah but alliance gets paladin and being justice incarnate is pretty great      
---
play 2 servers? Unless you have the same amount of play time, there is likely to be times you are playing and she is not. Play horde then and then alliance when she is playing.
---
I've heard RFD is a good source of pickpocketing + boss loot.
---
Probably the only comment I'm with you on, you filthy horde scum.
---
Is it possible to be a dedicated tank in vanilla and still have a full time job?
---
I see two options:
---
If your wife is willing to play a melee class, have her taste a good horde-made WF totem, crappy alliance paladins blessings will seem so annoying to her afterward, she will do the right thing and embrace the right faction!
---
If it's not the case, you can start lobbying to have one day The Classic Burning Crusade become a reality, be prepared to wait for a few more years and you should hopefully be able to united in game too, just hoping she has nothing against Blood elves and their nasty magic addiction!
---
2.1 is when dailies were added, which was only 4 months after the expansion launched.  That had most of the reps from TBC in it.  2.2 only changed it so you could pick up (but not complete) more dailies even if you had hit your daily limit.  The only dailies that were added in 2.4 were the Isle dailies.
---
Happy Wife, Happy Life. 
---
Not to mention, alliance is the best.
---
Same exact story as you. Je suis aussi montréalais.
---
Don't worry, as a priest you wont need that +hit till Razuvious
---
You want 2 hunters max in a raid. I expect there to be way more mages/rogues/DPS warriors to choose from, now that people understand the try hard meta class DPS breakdown. So, I'd expect getting a raid spot as a hunter to be a little tricky honestly.
---
Yet it is Trolls who have Regeneration.
---
You thought of it 2nd.
---
They want to be pvp gods but they need some raid gear to get an edge. Once they get said gear they leave the raiding scene behind until aq40 when they can't compete with full 2.5 players anymore 
---
Its not really a concern, those classes are played more because there are so many more raid spots for them.  
---
See, these aren't time-gated though. You can just sit down and do them as you please, instead of "log in daily, do thing, log out"
---
josh got a bigg buss
---
You are misinformed, which is fine, but I would stop digging this hole if I were you.
---
I’m going to order a 144hz 1080p monitor. Is 1440p much better or only a small difference? 
---
how are the chances with epics/blues? out of my time farming brd TOTAL i've seen 3 boe blues
---
I'm just saying that druids give enough time saving in return from gearing up that the extra time saved will last you a long time. You don't have to use pummelers once your guild has them in farm, you will still do better dps than the mage classes without the pummelers, so you can just get a few for the harder bosses. The guild will already have you in high regard.
---
Im not trying to convert you, just saying that you don't lose much time compared to other classes if you do it right with the mobility you have, the multi role filling, the stealth. Heck if you have a good guild and proven yourself you don't need to raid every week since you will gear up faster than any other class but warlocks, saving a whole lot more time in the week. 
---
Drill claw!
---
Play according to your own desires, no of others.
---
I have read this entire thread, and I want to make some clarifications.
---
"Items..."
---
b4y4rd is correct that it only says "item", and I guess that is an oversight on my part. I do not mean to exclude things such as enchants just because they are not items, provided they are profession exclusive (which I don't think exists in vanilla). I will update this to say something along the lines of "Item or effect".
---
"...that you need the profession to get and/or to fully benefit from."
---
The way I see it is that enchants and Steel Weapon Chain do not qualify for the list, while Arcanite Skeleton Key and the rest of the keys do qualify. My reasoning is that the full benefits of enchants and SWC are entirely divorced from the presence of the professional character once they have been applied, while keys require the presence of a professional on the site of the lock. I see how this is a fine line to draw, and how b4y4rd arrived at his conclusion, but I think this is the best way to draw the distinction. SWC is not a "perk" of having BS, but the keys are. When 1776nREE said "which items can I not buy my way into", he hit pretty close to the mark.
---
Primary professions
---
Since everyone can get every secondary profession, even if items are profession exclusive they aren't really exclusive in any real way, so I decided to stay within the realm of the primary professions.
---
Engineering
---
Since putting together a list for Engineering looks like a bigger undertaking, I decided to focus on all the other ones for now. It will sure be annoying to try to compile a list for engineering. The information available seems to be a lot worse than what I expected.
---
Here's my main point to anyone who may say it's just nostalgia and hates the classic community for whatever reason.
---
You can go to twitch right now and watch people play classic games from Atari, nes, snes, sega, N64 etc... They play these games all the time. Some of these people do not desire to play any of the new AAA titles being released. So is it just nostalgia when they play these games daily? Are they dilusionsal just because they like classic 8 and 16bit games?
---
Another thing is to look at Everquest Project 1999, it's still going. 
---
So to the retail players who hate the classic community. You can have your hand outs and your dress up competitions. I want to work for my rewards and I can't wait to look like a hobo with all my mix matched armor. 
---
Of course. You might not hit any server-firsts, but other than that you will be fine.
---
Having not really played WoW for a long time, I had happily forgotten they even existed.
---
Even if you hate shopping... when your wife asks you to go with her to help choose new panties.. you say yes.
---
Same thing applies here.
---
Also roll an alt and corpse camp her.
---
Yeah, was that in Vanilla? I remember doing it in BC.
---
Everything of Level 70 ETC
---
Just tell her to roll Horde,  if you want to play together.  What's the difference how the char looks vs not being able to play together.  Alliance is boring,  would never play them,  so I feel ya. 
---
My girlfriend joined me in T.B.C. back when it was present-day. We married at the ten-year mark of dating. 
---
I asked her, "Hey, how did you even end up creating your priest back in the day?", and her answer was that she saw that it was something that I was super into, and so she saw it as probably the most reliable way to spend time with me. 
---
She also loved Lord of the Rings, *also* binges Netflix, and decided priest for whatever reason. I pressed her as to why she made the class choice, and she said, "So I could heal you." When I asked why choose heals over D.p.S. or tank, she claims that she recalled either me complaining or me remarking that *others* were complaining about a lack of willing healers, so she "wanted to be whatever was in short supply", quote her.
---
Anyhow, I wish I had more details, but it was the better part of a decade ago. Did I let her first create an alt on my account? I had two accounts, and so perhaps I just let her create her own little corner on my second one? How did that particular exchange go down? What was the "first step" of initiation? I cannot recall...
---
I notice good hunters in dungeons a lot when they do stuff like ice trap mobs, feign retrap, and know how to kite mobs. I remember being really impressed by this hunter in Maraudon. I was healing and the dinosaurs with aoe silence where causing havoc. Our warrior couldn't shout and couldn't hold aggro well, so as soon as I got off a healer deep into combat the dinosaurs would all beeline me and silence then eat me alive. Also the other DDs were bad and wouldn't get them off me or would lead them to me. Our hunter saved the day a few times by siccing his pet on one, ice trapping another, and putting on Cheetah and kiting another to good know where before feigning. Our group had limited CC so he basically cut the number of mobs in half. Saved the day when a rock elemental pat came through. It would have been really rough without him and it was probably the first time a saw a hunter and the we like "this guy's good".
---
Now that this topic has been brought up, are they going to limit your playable factions the same way it was on release? I’d assume so, but I try not to spend my time reading up on every classic update because it makes me sad waiting for the release. I don’t recall seeing anything that’s mentioned this yet. 
---
This is why as an old as man I will be playing pve. I just don't have time for that.
---
Female troll and female orc models don't look bad. Just persuade her to the correct side.
---
Okay that's all fine. I just have one confusion, you don't need a blacksmith on site once a door is open. Just as an enchant no longer needs the enchanter. At the time of use both require a BS which is where I misinterpret how you want the list
---
Women don't usually like men who put them on a pedestal, except the crazy ones, in my experience.
---
You can start playing in the right side of the war. 
---
Sorry, Orchish Is my first language
---
I didn't mind dailies, but when they raised and then removed the cap it was ridiculous. Probably one of the only examples of,  "you think you want that but you don't, " that blizzard ever said that was even close to accurate. 
---
"No Warrior who has to mix in a bunch of threat gear is going to be able to match the durability of a Druid, though, who can also output an insane threat ceiling when necessary. "  
---
This isn't true. Warriors have the superior mitigation baked in to their abilities. Nothing a druid can do really matches the mitigation of Shield Block, Shield Wall, and Last Stand. 
---
I'm between Warlock and Hunter. I'll be leveling with people most, but not all of the time. I feel like they are pretty similar. What would be the factors I should most consider between the two?
---
It would also depend on the gear class of my friends.
---
Just dont Play warrior/rogue as they scale quite a lot with gear
---
Exactly! I was that crazy shaman that tanked half the dungeons while leveling and even at 60 because we couldn't find a warrior.  I even remember trying to OT one of the bosses in ZG. 
---
So we had to come up with some tricky plans, use cc and so on. And most of the time it really worked. Was it optimal? Of course no. But it was FUN
---
I hate sponge bob but barrens chat is funny
---
There are 3 factions: The Alliance, The Horde and The Night Elves. The reason is simple. The Night Elves are superior to all other races and to top the racism with a bit of sexism, you have to pick female unless you're a Druid as is tradition.
---
Same way they level quickly, with a healer. But it's much easier to find similar level healers at 60 than it is while leveling.
---
Gnomes are for stepping 
---
Rogue has the highest potential reward for complex rotation if you take into account the timing of special attacks to maximize bonus swing efficiency along with energy pooling and keeping up SnD with CDs.   Wars have a couple buttons you mash on cooldown, keep from going rage capped, managing cooldowns with procs, then execute spam.  Hunters have to weave shots/trinkets/gear swaps between auto shots.  None of them are really that challenging or fun imo.
---
I think I got my girl because I caught her by surprise. I normally have a very laid back and mellow attitude. I am normally super calm and never emotional. Well when she said we had to play allie. When I say I yelled that at her. What I really mean is I shrieked at her like a mouse cornered by a lion. It may have been the genuine panic in my eyes that swayed her lol.
---
I do not care about a lot of things. I grew up poor as shit. I wore used clothes from the thrift store. I ate food I hated. Shit I didn't have much to brag about. My point is I don't really care about most things but, for some reason. I care about wow. I care about it more then any 30 year old adult has any right to. If I had to play allie. I may actually cry. Sad as it is. I'm not lying. This shit is in my veins. I simply can not play an allie. Maybe that makes me an idiot. Meh I can live with it lol.
---
Too short ☹️
---
Assuming it's the same as Vanilla, it's only limited on PvP servers - Normal servers allowed you to play both factions.
---
I can't imagine Classic will be any different in that regard to Vanilla.
---
" Unlike warrior abilities that simply have a flat bonus to threat, Maul has a 1.75x threat modifier (which is further modified by bear form bonuses). This means that feral's TPS scales insanely well with gear.  "  
---
You aren't wrong, but a fury warrior's TPS is largely dictated by his damage output, not the flat bonus threat modifier.  Fury warrior dps scales insanely well with gear. So fury warrior TPS also scales insanely well with gear.   
---
They can pop recklessness or death wish to essentially apply a 2.2x+ modifier to their damage. That damage is all buffed by their 1.45x threat gen in def stance. So, yea, we can play the same games with numbers for warrior threat and make similar arguments.
---
Play alliance, then when one day tbc classic comes out strong arm her into rerolling a blood elf. Check and mate.
---
Do you know how long you have to grind to get an epic mount in classic...?
---
&gt; Not totally sure why they don't just release the patches in order.
---
1. That would be a logistical nightmare
---
2. Early vanilla patches were broken beyond belief, even by vanilla standards
---
3. 1.12 is the most complete and polished version of vanilla.
---
&gt;Blizzard was obviously focusing their attention on TBC, which is why there was such little content added after the first half of Classic.
---
....you sound like you have absolutely no idea how videogame development works, to be completely honest.
---
One thing to note. Blue gear is very good and will keep you competitive. If you want to smash people, you will need to get either ranked PvP gear or raid to some extent. Gear is much more rare in vanilla, so it takes longer for raiders to gear up. If you just want to PvP, you will be fine with doing blues/crafted until the PvP rewards/ZG come out.
---
I like the horde races better, but I have to give dwarves credit, their lore and personalities are pretty cool.
---
Ashenvale. 
---
While I agree with the overall thrust of your point, regarding the last paragraph, I'd like to draw your attention to [Pantheon] (https://www.pantheonmmo.com/). It's being developed by Brad McQuaid, lead developer of EverQuest, as a spiritual successor thereunto, and it's explicitly eschewing self-sustaining class design in favor of defined roles and interdependence.

...damn, I sound like a shill here. Honestly not trying to advertise the game, least of all on this sub, I just felt it worth pointing out. WoW Classic, and Pantheon before it, didn't come out of nowhere; as your own post demonstrates, they're very much a response to an increasingly vocal segment of the market who've been dissatisfied by the options available to us for several years now and wanting something different.
---
Sure, it's something of a niche segment - even in my wildest dreams in which Classic eclipses the popularity of BfA, I harbor absolutely no illusions of it being in anywhere near the same weight class as the battle royale or MOBA colossi currently dominating the industry. That said, it being a niche market doesn't mean it's not a profitable one if done right. Oftentimes it's better to be the big fish in a small pond than to try to take on the orcas and hammerheads in the open ocean.
---
In Blizzard's case, they're simply going back to what they know works; Pantheon's being a bit more ambitious in trying to blend the old with some new. Either way, as an old-school immersion gamer I'm as happy as a pig in excrement that *someone* has finally started to take notice of us and they're working on building something that gives us a reason to give them our money.
---
Also, I disagree about kids today not understanding/liking what made Classic great. I've every confidence a fair number of them will try out and fall in love with the game just as we first did 14 years ago. Sure, the landscape has changed a lot since then, but great game design is great game design regardless of era. The game's still fun, and that's still ultimately what draws people in.
---
Id rather there were some.  You aren’t obligated to do them at all.  It was an easy way to farm cash without competing with the chinese.  I was a 2 boxer so I earned double.  It did get crazy if you tried to do them all.  
---
I always thought those orc rogues in UBRS looked awesome, the ones right before the beast. Every time I did that dungeon I wanted to change mains haha.
---
Kalu'ak fishing dailies as well :) 
---
LOL tanking dual wield fury has NOTHING to do with keeping up w druids man.
---
I seriously hope they fix this exploit. When I heard about people doing this it made me so angry back in the day.
---
Blizz can easily flag accounts that use unstuck often. It should only be used very rarely for legitimate reason, not a couple times a day.
---
&gt;I'm not a smaht man
---
Just because they were solution to a problem does not mean that they were a good solution.  I'd much rather do it the classic way, where you had to make a decision about how you would obtain money.  Professions were one way.  Grinding mobs being another way.  Running instances that were still relevant at max level and selling BoPs were another.  I'm not saying that these are the best / most fun, but they allowed you to make a decision, and I would have liked to have seen a better idea more in line with the values of classic.  Dailies inflated the economy and became something that you HAD to do if you needed cash to buy anything, because everyone else was doing them.  They were an optimal way of obtaining money and why wouldn't you slog through the most optimal way?

I do respect my fellow players!

Hello!  
---
If you never step foot in a raid or a PvP instance ever your entire WoW career, you'll end up in what's referred to as pre-raid Best in Slot. For Holy Pallies (as in, healing only gear), that's mostly blues with green wrists and an epic cloak. You'll also probably pick up a mostly blue/some crafted epic Ret set, for soloing stuff.   
---
The pre-raid gear is PLENTY to heal 5/10 man dungeons consistently, especially if it's properly enchanted (you can save up your gold to get enchants from the people who ARE raiding and will thus get the recipes!), but in mostly cloth you'll be a bit squishier than normal healing PvP, but still very effective since Pallies have such a wide range of utility.  
---
Good news is, even if you spend most of your time working on yourself irl (which is a commendable and good thing to do!), if you get to that level of gear you'll absolutely be able to jump into pug MC/BWL runs as a healer eventually maybe every other weekend when you feel like it where you can possibly pick up some new pieces if you're lucky! You'll probably never seriously see the inside of AQ40 and Naxx while casually playing, but MC/BWL/AQ20/ZG are totally within the realm of possibility without taking 4-5 hours every night, if you feel like it! :)  
---
[Here's a BiS list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1246215761) for every tier, done up by Pingaan, it only has Holy listed for Paladins, but this will show you those pre-raid BiS lists I mentioned before, as something to aim for if you want to. :)
---
Nostalgia doesn't come from nothing, or I would feel nostalgia from other MMOs or wow expansion/other games is general. Wow classic was great mostly because gear mattered, took time and effort. Also the social aspect was the best, with every expansion after the social aspect (good and bad!) suffered and now wow very anti social and you can do all the content without ever speaking a word. Expect the 1% top performer for the highest difficulty, which means nothing since everyone looks the same with transmogs and the benefit of the gear doesn't give you much if any advantage in pvp. 
---
&gt; Gnomes are for ~~stepping~~ punting
---
FTFY
---
LOL @ the Scarlet Monestary hat.
---
You're missing out on the biggest benefit to Reckoning: A /sit macro.
---
You don't pick up reckoning while leveling only for extra hits every once in a while. You do it so you can /sit on every mob swing and chunk them down faster than an arms warrior. It's without a doubt the fastest leveling spec until you're high enough level to pull off AoE prot.
---
Of course she his hot.
---
Haha holy shit boys. I was in their guild, Knuckleheads. I was the original hunter before they joined, Tallem. I got to R11 and almost ruined my life.” Chasing Rokk and Rolled.
---
That’s amazing, small world.

As a mage/warlock player I can't really relate, gear means nothing until 58 :}

You... hate Spongebob...? To each their own, but damn - maybe one of the best comedic cartoons ever made.

Honestly, the video was perfect length. You did not drag it out too long. You quickly explained how the item works, and how to get it. Perfect explanation video in my opinion. Also, bonus points for the puns with 43 runs and hunter killing you in Winterspring!

Wait, are you telling me those weren't scripted parts of getting the items? :p 
---
There is no dungeon in vanilla that I hate as much as DM:W.
---
My guess would be the 20-yard range. Puts you at risk for the Mage to get even closer during your cast and hit you with Frost Nova. Then he uses Ice Block to break the Fear and hits you with a Shatter combo. 
---
Much safer to just put Curse of Tongues + pet + Corruption on the Mage from max range - he won't be able to scratch the Warlock, and Warlock wins eventually.
---
If they want to be MT they will. No guild that wants to do content seriously takes a Tank that is not min/maximizing. And not many, if at all, guilds will take a Guardian Druid as MT because it is more than suboptimal.
---
1st - 1g

I'd go for professions but as a rogue I recommend herb. Easy income and you can get your reagents for your skills yourself. While grinding, remember to pick pocket every mob, if you're not too far away from a vendor or have enough bag space. It will yield you a good extra income. If you're going daggers, you can team up with a rogue perhaps a third depending on your gear, and kill The Barman in BFD. If you get better geared, you can team up or even solo the succubus' demon elites in southern Winterspring for Eye of Shadow which I'm sure a lot of world first priests wants for their Benediction. The drop rate is fairly low, but if you put in a few hours, the hourly gain is still quite high. I've gotten a couple of Eye of Shadows myself.
---
I earned a good deal back in the day from selling wholesale elixirs and potions to top guilds. 
---
Being able to raid once or twice a week would be enough to raid casually. Even probably a step above casual if you could find a little additional time to farm. I played on private servers for about 3 years and never played at all on a Friday or Saturday and we cleared naxx. My social and personal life wasn't affected at all.

Exploit will not be exploitable in Classic.

You should add after the options where the ninja is kicked:

Most gave 4G20s apiece. I used to do all dailies on my warrior and hunter. But, IQD was really cool to me. Can't wait to play Classic again!

That's been my desktop background for several weeks now.

Sounds like she only want to play the superficial “pretty” class and does not understand the true beauty of a female orc. 
---
Gank her mercilessly on an undead rogue, then feed on her corpse until she recognizes the errors in her way. 
---
&gt; I was in a pretty hardcore reading guild
---
Nothing says hardcore like a big stack of books.
---
Haha that’s crazy. I was in Eos, we were the PVP guild that the torch was passed to after a lot of Knuckleheads stopped. I was the next warrior to get GM after Rolled. PVP’d with Ayrll and the 2 hunters. 
---
Time to get the gang as well as the horde we used to play against back together. 
---
This is what makes me skeptical about classic. 
---
People want "challenging" content. Blizzard releases perfect amazing challenging content. People whine and complain, and it gets nerfed. Cata normal raids weren't completed until like the 3rd or 4th week, and there was like only 3 or 4 guilds that actually completed heroic raids. It was really great. 
---
Having dailies introduced instead of just being able to grind a rep/faction whenever I wanted was the downfall of WoW for me, I worked solid 5 days a week and just didn't have the energy to go home and play WoW, back in Classic - this was fine, I could spend all the time I wanted on my weekend grinding through Timbermaw Hold for as long as I wanted without anything stopping me. When I had dailies introduced to me, I basically got shafted as it meant I could really only get a small capped amount of rep rather than being able to go at it how I wanted.
---
Blizzard always talk about catering to the casual but Dailies to me feel anti-casual, maybe it's just me but they screwed me over anyway. That's my two cents on them!
---
I’ve got a 49 twink orc rogue. My favorite character haha. Those shoulder pads and that sprint animation.  
---
What do they do with the healer assuming they can find one? What kind of routes / farming zones do they hit ? 
---
&gt;There's a reason the top post of this subreddit is where it is.     
---
         
---
The fact that that post was so popular blew my mind, not only because of how vehemently and adamantly I *disagree* with it, but because of how positive of a reception it got.          
---
            
---
It made me realize the classic "community" is not nearly as monolithic as I had thought, which is actually quite saddening to me because I *do* want a perpetual time capsule, I *don't* want to progress, and the fact that others do when I thought they didn't means that, maybe 3 maybe 5 years down the road, I might not have my Classic anymore.       
---
       
---
It's probably stupid to dwell on hypotheticals before the game even comes out, and I've got at least a good few years of the content I *do* want ahead of me, so it's not a total loss in the end.
---
Play some multiplayer games and then try a single player then wow. 
---
Its a pretty easy progression to get into the game. 
---
i used to really like that logging camp pvp daily, since i played late at night and i could use it to get Honor points without actually having to get ganked every 5 seconds because I sucked.
---
If a mob is alive long enough for the extra ticks from imp SW:P, you're failing.
---
Sounds a bit like VanasKoS - I'm using it on pservers still.
---
Gorshun has the right values and you are correct 5g a month reduction to a minimum of 10g.
---
My original character was a priest and I switched to warrior because finding a competent tank for dungeons was tough. Leveling as a warrior solo does suck, but dungeons ease the pain. 
---
Possibly the aspect of Classic about which I'm most excited is getting the *Horde* back. The one without those prissy, prancing point ear cusses who rolled in like a craft-herpes tsunami and ruined it all back in '07.
---
Gnomes are for punting.
---
Elves are for eating.

The only good pointy ears^1 is a dead one.

Lok'tar ogar, brothers! *For the Horde!*

That’s awesome. Those were great times of Horde AFKing because paladins. Wasn’t the Hordes main warrior a Tauren Vaako?

Lol I’m in.

He may be right with regards to dueling outside IF/Org, but in the world not everyone you encounter is gonna be perfectly METAing all the time. People aren't *that* good across the board - and even then, you'll have the environment to work with, different CD's up etc. The situation is always changing.
---
 In recent WoW, health pools are so big that people generally can get settled into their META routine. But classic will have faced paced fights, where small errors will matter alot. People will fuck up. The best will shine even if everyone technically knows the META.
---
Female undead is pretty legit as well.
---
And the priest was Taco I think
---
“What the hell do you need those healing legs for?!”
---
“My mend pet set.”
---
Just to be a little pedantic, you cap out at 99% hit so 3 points will put you at 99% hit and 2 points puts you at 98%.  You can weigh the value of that 3rd point yourself, but just letting you know it won’t put you at 100% hit.
---
The name rings a bell but they must’ve hit HWL or stopped before I ended up facing them. We spent a lot of time fighting Rawr and Rendz, both undead.

I know but the jaina thing is getting boring.

/sitting against a mob for auto crits is an exploit? Since when?
---
gank her until she rerolls horde, ez
---
I can't say for all classes of course but protection paladin for example I just hit buttons literally all the time, just thinking if the one GCD is not wasted/inefficiently used for this lower level ability than some other. I have 2 abilities that hit multiple targets in front of me with multiple charges both, one single target nuke, one AoE, one stun and one freaking avenger's shield that I just throw like captain America, smashing four targets for like 1/3 of their health (my lvl), so I can usually pull like 5 mobs and just AoE them down.
---
Compared to vanilla prot paladin is uncanny.
---
What you're saying definitely has some merit. Somewhere in this thread you said that the box or door could be seen as having been "enchanted" into an open state, and that isn't an unreasonable way of seeing it.
---
Here is another way in which I would make a distinction between an enchant and the use of a key: The benefit of the enchant manifests over time, as the character gets into combat and uses relevant abilities. The benefit of a key manifests only in the instant when it is used to open a lock. In that moment, it can't be separated from the character with the profession.
---
Maybe another way of seeing it is that a non-professional character can take an enchant with them to another place and benefit from it, but if a door or box has been opened by a BS with a key, a non-professional character can't "bring" that opening to another box or to a different door. IDK if either of these explanations make sense, but hey...
---
I am trying to avoid appealing to "the spirit of the list", since clear definitions are better for everyone. Like I said, I deffo see how you could land on your interpretation of this. If you want to contribute any more to the list, feel free to post even if you aren't sure whether I will want to include it.
---
Rawr sounds familiar. Man. I need to see if I have my old hard drives from back then, I know I have some screenshots somewhere.
---
Now just need to figure out the server hosting locations for that precious ping.

Sap him, destroy his totems, reset the fight. GG

Hope no one calls you an asshole. It’s was happened to me the first time I posted asking for thing a that already happened.

Sure to Classic Cata or whenever it was.
---
I don’t see why you’d be downvoted (like I’m sure to be now.). Not against any terms and really only helps add an additional vote to the Classic WoW success pool.
---
I wish I could give advice on Classic more, but I can only offer an outside-looking-in perspective having come from late TBC.
---
I think dual stealthing would be AWESOME and give great dungeon running potential.  Lots of “solo” play diversity with the Druid/rogue.
---
I’m partial to the priest/warrior route because I love the warrior and think being your own heals while nonstop smashing would be a blast.
---
Warriors and Rogues press more buttons, if that’s what you want. I suppose Feral Druid would also go here if you are willing to put in a ton of work for less damage.
---
Play to our strengths, show her how many Horde men run around shirtless on a daily basis.
---
What do you mean? People are going to get mad because someone is looking to meet new people. 
---
If she chooses healer I would probably choose mage. My reasoning is you will smooth out a healers deficiency in leveling allowing a smoother leveling experience because healers are noticeably slower killing monsters imo. Also for dungeons mages offer one of the most rounded toolkit with cc, buffs,decent dps,water and food. I think a pally mage or priest mage would be the better choices if you went that route. 
---
If she chooses dps as a hunter i again believe the two healers I listed above would be fun. You mentioned warriors which are my personal class choice being gear depending and your not wrong. A well feared warrior is great at every role they play but with limited time it may take you a while to get to that point. But even an average geared warrior can be a lot of fun to play. In a duo group I imagine you will want to run dungeons nothing makes it easier than already having a tank. 
---
My english is still crap but I learnt it from WoW for the most part.
---
Play a warrior. You don’t have to worry about saving for your epic mount because you’ll never get it. Plate repair bills are awesome. 
---
Also you’ll get longer breaks because when it hits the fan you’re the first to die. 
---
Lmao aegwynn was my server for like 7 years GGs
---
Other posters said it, but basically: Classic is a role playing game. Every class has a distinct and defined role that is different from every other class. No one is overpowered because everyone has a job and that job is necessary for success.
---
Except Shaman. Instantly killing someone as soon as they pop their cooldowns is pretty fucking overpowered. But that's never changing, so get used to it or play Horde so you don't have to fight against them.
---
that's pretty cool. It wasn't wow specifically but we've had a guildie from Mexico for years and over time his English has improved significantly. 
---
Pretty sure most hunter spells are instacast so they dont get max benefit from spell power. Theres plenty of arcane damage drops from mc and bwl but they are considered trash loot
---
There's one cute face for troll in vanilla though
---
&gt;I never thought I would say this being raised a proper neck beard but, we need our blood elves. WE NEED THEM MAN!!!
---
Anyone who refuses to play Horde because it doesn't have any prissy cussing pointy ears prancing about doesn't belong in the Horde in the first place.
---
I already lost my beloved Horde to that noddle-limbed pink tsunami of anthropomorphic craft-herpes once before. I'll be damned if I'm going to let it happen again.
---
I'm not saying there's not alot of women who mean that, I'm reacting to you claiming every human female means it. While I obviously can undertsand that it was a exaggeration, you are kinda undermining the big amount of gamers who actually are women. There are ALOT of them; stop hanging out with idiots.

1.10ish. A sit will still 100% crit, but will not cause a crit-proc'd ability.

https://youtu.be/eM1ZzyUh-ls Here is the pvp video of a guy on my server. He really showed people what is possible for skilled hunters. Keep in mind this is very early vanilla.
---
There goes my one and only reason to play Classic.
---
Asshole.
---
I've never had an issue with dailies as stuff to do. What I've always hated was dailies that were "mandatory" and especially how "mandatory" they felt.  I never had a problem with TBC dailies because the factions that had dailies were, almost completely, just for fun/benefit.  All the factions that had "essentials," like enchants, good gear, or recipes were not done with dailies, they were done with dungeon rep or turn ins. You could ignore dailies completely and, other than gold, be perfectly fine.  That contrasts to Legion/BfA, where ignoring dailies will leave you so far behind that you wouldn't be able to be a part of nearly any progression content. 
---
If I compare expansions and lookat the "feeling of being mandatory" versus just ways to spend time:
---
TBC: There were some great gear options (including some BiS items), and enchants from reputation, but most were locked behind reps that did not require dailies, or at least not much (Aldor/Scryer, Cenarion, etc). Their rep was primarily obtained from simply playing the game (running dungeons, turning in drops, doing PvP, etc). The dailies grind was primarily for cosmetic stuff like mounts or just for gold making. This changed a bit with the Isle, but if you were a raider, you could still largely ignore them.
---
Wrath: Dailies became a bit more mandatory. You needed rep to get those shoulder/head enchants, and some quests didn't unlock until you had a certain rep (up at ToC, at least).  However, since Wrath had the tabard system, you could still largely ignore dailies for most things if you wanted. 
---
Cata: Much like Wrath, the daily system could be largely avoided once you could get a tabard, which you almost always could by the time you finished questing in that zone.  This changed with the Molten Front system, when some of the best gear in the game at that time was locked behind the reputation and you had to do the rep grind to unlock more of the Molten Front zone.  However, you still *could* largely ignore them and not be that far behind.
---
MoP: Real end to the "optional" daily system.  You had to do dailies to unlock rep, you had to get rep to unlock other faction's rep, you had to get rep up to buy badge gear. You had to get rep up to progress storylines.  Rep was basically mandatory for anyone not wanting to fall behind.
---
WoD: No dailies!  Well, one (until the end). However, they made the factions so pointless that it wasn't even worth doing them.  
---
Legion/BfA: "Dailies" (aka WQs) are 100% mandatory if you want to compete, as you have no other way of getting enough AP to keep up otherwise.
---
Isn't resolution a bit too low?

If she doesn't like games, she doesn't like games.  Give it a rest and stop bothering her.  If she eventually wants to try it out then set her up to try it out.

You don't have to have WoW in common to be with each other.

I play horde, husband played alliance. I just ganked him until he switched. He mostly did it to "play with me" I found out later. I was at the point to where I was getting bored with the game and he gave me something to look forward to. (This was in BC before achievements)
---
Im assuming he was looking for past wow friends and there is a vanilla friend finding thread so you can see everyone who has applied to be on it, however you are looking for anyone to play, not sure why people would be pissed 
---
Warlock imo. Just a bit more utility to offer groups and they actually scale decently at endgame with gear. 
---
Obviously it won’t happen BUT I wish the respec cost capped out at 5g. Only because the price can make switching between raid and pvp specs a pain.
---
You know what would really show your horde pride? Making a gnome with no facial hair, no hair, and the grinning face.
---
Oh didnt know that , new to redditt like i said ill remove the post
---
Nah you should be fine to be honest.
---
Yeah exactly lol.  I used to have a stack of these when I bought 60 day passes, except when I started playing (end of vanilla) you could just go on the website and click "10 day trial" without a pass.
---
Honestly I get it. about 95% of my body mass agrees with you. The other 5% wants girls to play too. The problem I have is the 5% that wants girls. Is not in any way quiet about it. He's loud and unreasonable. 
---
What meta? there is no arena, there is no rated BGs.  You can premade BGs for honor grinding and in that every class has a role to play and shine at between warsong and AB.  You don't always have the right people on to make an ideal comp so team comps vary based on who is online or available. The nature of the vanilla honor system is quantity over quality.  You don't wait around for those last 2 people to log on and form the perfect comp and then que up for a few games to make sure you get every last win and no losses, you take what you can get and spam the que to maximize honor per hour because even losses push you forward and even a mediocre premade is going to stomp non-premades of which you will que into plenty.
---
In a vacuum some classes match up poorly against others but the shortcomings can often be made up for with engineering and consumables.  At the highest levels of play match ups are almost never 100-0 in favor of one or the other and depend largely on if both are willing to blow through consumables and no 1 sided RNG (assuming equal skill, gear, and cooldowns being available).  
---
The "OP meta classes" that will matter for most people are the ones that are strong in solo que BGs with a bunch of randos running just looking for some cheap thrills.  Most people in this setting won't have endless consumables, team synergy, or situational awareness.  You will see mages dumping on wars and rogues, hunters dumping on anyone who doesn't get in their face, SL locks living for ever while melting people without a healer, rogues jumping people at low health, the odd warrior with a healer babysitting him trucking through people, some 1-shot meme specs recording crit videos, then a bunch of back and forth chaos baring any exceptionally skilled player being present.
---
Why would I want to use a program owned by a corporation that harvests and sells my personal information?
---
Lol fair enough.  
---
Play both faction. Problem solved. 
---
Nice!  What was your character name / class?
---
I was later in Dawnbreakers in Vanilla, then Thanatos / Prestige / Deus Invictus / Mana Tapped in TBC as Finagle/Soulleech.
---
I think it'll have its own trailer to go with the release date announcement.  They're definitely going to put out another trailer.
---
the gold sink helps regulate the economy tho 
---
Yeah, and thats fine its your list. You have the final say on what you want in or out of the list. And thats dandy, I am glad you could see where I was coming from. I included more items that I could think of off the top of my head. And broken blade I used since when it becomes reforged that is a different item, technically. In order to get any use of a broken blade you have to be BS. Which I understand with your perspective given how that doesnt appeal to the spirit of the list. When I look at a list I think of everything that fits under the prescribed ruleset for the list, not what the lists spirit is saying my apologies.
---
OMG GET THAT GIRL AWAY FROM RON JEREMY!
---
I dont think its a great idea. Just another ”no changes except this one”.
---
I guess for her sake you have to play the superior faction. Hopefully she brings you to the light
---
Been there done that. Long story short I lost. We play alliance now...
---
Stop being a wuss. Grow a pair and let her play the game the way she enjoys it

What personal info are you entering into discord? 
---
People will literally pick hunters because they need people to take the gear.  I guarantee every guild isn't going to min-max.  It's not even close to necessary.  All you need is like 25 guys doing their job in MC to progress.  You have 15 other spots for shitty DPS to take as long as they don't take gear from your bottom line.

Hey! Those green alien invaders deserved way worse than being locked up! That was mercy I say!
---
Oh I totally agree. I was just stating that it’s a bit of an annoyance, especially if you want to raid and be active in BGs. An unnamed server I’ve played on for the past year capped respec costs at 5g and it’s been sweet. I’d rather deal with respec costs than a bunch of minuscule changes though 
---
I appreciate the info dump. Thank you
---
They're the best DPS, but doing that makes gearing a bitch.  You can't possibly gear up 10 mages at the same time when bosses drop 2-3 items that aren't even guaranteed to be cloth.
---
Mortal Strike....
---
Pantheon? Nice, I’ll look into it. At the price game costs, I’m usually reluctant to buy random games that I don’t know are good already. Wow being a Blizzard product so many years ago, I knew it was going to be an epic game. Pantheon being the little baby of a dev from Everquest is definitely worth giving it a shot. I’ll look i to that. Thanks for the tip. :D
---
To me, it really shows you how we act as humans. You could do a task every day and not care but attach a daily to it and it suddenly it becomes an obligation and lose the desire. 
---
No worries at all man I’ll def check it out, appreciate the reply and the video; I’m at work as well but ofc browsing Classic WoW like it’s my real job
---
Not sure why you're saying that to me.  
---
I also hated dailies and never did them.
---
I'm sure they added some bullshit spell that gave you a goldfish bowl around your head or something similiar to give the non-druid/lock classes to breathe underwater.
---
As an Undead Rogue wearing full PvP gear I felt my badassery waning as I rode around on a seahorse like the Little Fucking Mermaid!
---
Yeah, I understand where you're coming from. But I look at it like this:
---
The alternative to 1.13+ is TBC servers. My issue with this is that it will split the Classic community into half: those who want Vanilla and those who want TBC.
---
Most will transfer to TBC, even some who dont like TBC but want to play with their friends or communities will have to make the leap as well. What happens to the Vanilla servers? They'll stagnate away, having lost so much of their population to TBC, and they'll become ghost towns. It will become even worse if Wrath releases and further divides the community.
---
If you prefer Vanilla, it becomes a choice of what you want more: a modified Classic with more stuff but not really trying to be exact to how it was in 2006 or a Classic that is almost entirely accurate but has no players in it, no soul that makes the world come alive. And, in my opinion, I'd rather have 1.13 if it meant that the dungeons, raids, and Azeroth as a whole stayed as relevant as they were before TBC released.
---
It's unfortunate that no matter how Blizzard goes about this issue: adding TBC servers, adding new content past Naxx, or adding nothing at all and simply keeping the Vanilla servers as they are, at least one subset of Classic fans is going to end up getting the bum end of the deal.
---
Bears can do 5 mans and off tank really well.  They generate more threat than a warrior.  They can't take the big hits, but they do more damage straight up.  They're the ones you want chasing down trash during a fight.
---
Agreed. This was DEFINITELY a thing in Vanilla. I made use of it often.
---
Is this one of the few instances where it's *the rogue* doing the fight reset?
---
Wrong. You used to be able to to talk to the opposite faction with /e.
---
Part of this is just natural selection.  The most popular of the "unpopular opinions" get upvoted because they are actually reasonably popular.  If you actually post a truly unpopular opinion it gets down voted and most people don't see it.
---
Ex:. I once said I thought mods/add-ons were cheating and that all buffs should get wiped when you enter a raid dungeon.  It was not received well.  
---
Part of the reason the game seems so easy on private servers is people stacking world buffs and the mountains of add-ons you can get.  I just found out there's even an add-on now that will basically do a Hunter's shot rotation for them!
---
Obviously we had add-ons back in 2006 but they were less refined (and even then I didn't use them.). I just think the game would be more fun/fair if everyone was playing the way blizzard intended.  
---
Also not saying world buffs weren't intended, as those are an in game mechanic.  I just think they shouldn't work in raids.
---
I healed up to Sunken Temple pretty comfortable as a shadow specced priest, started to get a little uncomfortable in Dire Maul (don't remember which wing) - did that with two different priests so it's perfect for a casual player looking to maximise they're limited playtime - you can solo quest pretty well and sill be able to heal when needed.
---
Can confirm. Wife mains a hunter on both Alliance and horde. 
---
You just haven't been googling "best warlock spec vanilla" for the last 15 years.
---
I’d actually say it’s the opposite. If things are dying before non talented swp finished you’re using too much mana killing things and will be leveling much slower than you should be.
---
Alliance...because you will find the best places to log on your horde and gank those newbs.

I got married last November. My wife is very "shallow" when it comes to games - if it looks pretty, she'll like it. So she enjoyed watching me play games like Last of Us and God of War, but says games like WoW are not her cup of tea (and that's putting it lightly). The only game she likes playing herself is Sims, strangely enough.
---
I convinced her to let me FORCE her to play the game when Classic comes out by appealing to the fact that I do all kinds of stuff with her that I don't enjoy, but I do it because I know it's important to her. I leveraged that and asked her to put forth at least a fraction of the effort I put into the stuff SHE enjoys. She tried the retail version, literally did one quest, leveled to level 2 and had the most miserable look on her face doing all of it to the point that I just told her to stop. I will try again come Classic - I told her she can quit when she reaches level 20. I have tried explaining to her all the reasons I enjoy the game so much, including the social aspect of it, but it still doesn't seem appealing to her. When Classic comes out and she plays to level 20 - if she still hates it by then, she's never gonna like it, and I will stop asking her - it will simply be my separate hobby (which is difficult because she wants to spend every single free moment she has with me, but doing stuff SHE enjoys). She may just be one of those people who hates games. My best friend is like that - he could enjoy a game, play it for half the day, but then feel terrible because he "wasted" the day playing a game instead of going out, hanging out, or partying or drinking (I don't see how THOSE aren't wastes of time). I think it's partly a stigma issue, where people don't enjoy incredibly fun things because it has been ingrained into them that it's a waste of time or an uncool thing to do, which is extremely irritating to me as a gamer.
---
Sorry for the long post and vent, but the last thing I wanted to mention was about "bombarding" with information. I figured if I let her discover the game on her own, she would enjoy it more. But that's not the case - she simply has no interest in discovering it. If your GF is anything like my wife, nudge her toward playing a simpler class (something with less abilities/buttons) like Rogue, Mage, Priest - I would not recommend anything with a pet and anything that has lots of situational spells. Don't hold her hand through everything, but do help her out. If you can, find a way to convince her to play with you at least through level 20ish (explain to her that it's important to you, that you enjoy the game very much and only want to do the thing you enjoy very much with the person who is most important to you - just ask her to tough it out for you for a little bit and if she doesn't like it by the end of it, you won't force her anymore). The reason you want to go to 20ish is because you will have done a dungeon by then, come across PvP, and experienced social aspects (asking to join a group for a quest, etc.)
---
Hope my information is at least useful to you, if not helpful.
---
This has been discussed a lot. Common ideas and thoughts:
---
1) It's too early to worry about this, wait until Classic comes out at least!
---
2) No new content, Classic stays as Vanilla content only but new servers open every now and then starting with the original content that we'll get day 1 in Classic.
---
3) Servers progress to TBC and so forth.
---
4) New content based on existing zones/locations in Classic is created (Hyjal, Caverns of Time, etc).
---
5) New content unrelated to current zones/locations is created, essentially new expansions.
---
I think that hits the main points that usually come up in these posts.
---
Never play Alliance.  
---
I mean, I really do like high/blood elves, they're one of my favorite races in the game if you're talking about pre-TBC lore. But I feel like Blizzard really dropped the bucket when TBC came out, blood elves just dont fit the Horde all that well. They belong under the Alliance banner more than they do the Horde banner (and blue eyes are a lot nicer than fel green eyes).
---
Yeah, I disagree with the hate on dailies in this thread. The addition of World Quest in Legion has been an excellent way to get people out in the world more often, which the game desperately needed.
---
Why is this so oddly amusing...
---
Dailies in pure technical terms differ in that they put you in a timelock. A daily is up when it is up, once you do it or miss it is gone - rep grind done, or wasted, putting you that much closer of further behind on getting your exalted status. It might not sound like a lot, but that is a difference that speaks to peoples tendencies. If you miss a day of dailies, you feel you are now behind by that day.
---
Thats the mild bit of it. The other side is the psychological part - it preys on the habit-making nature we all have. Once something is a habbit, we are far more like to keep doing it. The bottom line becomes that blizzard can do less content for longer subscriptions, nevermind that good gameplay suffers. The others side is player incentive - rather than deciding to grind for something specific, you have a set laid out path that you are meant to do. Might make things more intuitive, which some will appreciate, but player choice is diminished.
---
Have you not had friends who refused to come do an activity until they were done with their daily chores? I certainly have. Even a friend i was boosting for his elite pvp set wanted to get those done first. (This happened here in beta for ass a lot and legion both) It might seem innocent enough, but it is perfectly possible - and being widely done - to manipulate people psychological with these differences.
---
BLIZZDERSNATCH

1. The penalty of +healing applies to spells under lvl 20 (so really low ranks of Holy Light). Since the earliest Flash of Light rank is obtained at level 20, I'd assume there wouldn't be any penalty. You don't really want to touch Holy Light outside of really heavy burst or when using your 100% crit spell anyways.
---
2. You take more damage in Zerker stance, which means you'd also generate more rage. You're thinking of the ability Berserker Rage, which makes you immune to Fear effects and increases the rage you gain from taking damage.
---
Plot Twist: Classic wow is a daily.
---
The way I see it, you really have two options.
---
One, pledge your life to the Horde, go with with C.
---
Two, maintain your Revered or Exalted status with the hardest faction in the game, Wife. Don't forget you even earn the title "Husband". It's easier, cheaper, more time efficient to roll Alliance than start that rep grind over.
---
Are you asking if you need to buy anything else before the monthy sub? If so, no. The sub gets you all of Classic.
---
Healer or Tank, 
---
Priest - Level as show / wand spec to bubble up and wand stuff to death and easy to find groups dungs. 
---
Tank, Warrior - Level as fury / Tank as fury until 55+ 
---
While leveling just make sure to have a really good shield and +Def items / +Stam to switch when looking into going for a dung. 
---
Filthy alliance.
---
I prefer night elf druid models and animations compared to tauren, but whenever I think about not having Org... I realize I can't go alliance
---
You dont spam mind blast on cooldown while leveling. Dot, 1 mb per mob and then wand city so I usually take those points and put a few in blackout just for the stuns because although unreliable they are clutch AF in pvp and always fun.
---
Force Reactive Disk is the single best AoE tank item in the game. If you ever want/need to do a 45 minute strat run for T0.5, you need that AoE threat.
---
True 
---
Yeah when im on private servers it seems like 80% of the player base is warrior, mage, and rogue. 
---
She may take pride in racism? Sounds like option C
---
Not if it hasn't happened yet in the world of classic wow &gt;.&gt;
---
But they can't read, tho...
---
Sum druid is 4 fyte
---
I was coming here to say this.  Fishing is low hanging fruit for cash.  If fishing pools are in the game it'll be easy money.

About as low as any other mob you'll farm

It's indeed a smaller %

It was def still a short range blink during tbc/wotlk cause as a kid i got banned using it to exploit over ab gate a few times lmao
---
40 characters? Wut 
---
This. On the last private server, I raided with 2 chars, one a rogue one a fury warrior. Sure, these classes are played quite a bit, but you also want to have quite a lot of them in your raid because melee dmg is king in MC &amp; BWL at least.

Damn suck to be you, i have been playing horde aince release of the game, and my gf/wife only want to roll a troll female hunter to gank ppl in stv . she could gank ppl for 2/3 hours a night only to trigger ppl.

Daily activities were fine when they weren't the only thing to do. I liked farming heroics in wrath because I thought the gearing system was cool but after I felt I did the dailies that I wanted to do, there was plenty of other ways to have fun which actually involved other people. Nobody goes and fucks around in tanaris with me anymore, they just want to do their  14 weekly invincible run and then spam m+ having a bad time with their rng gear system. 
---
Ah great! So you only create an Account, pay 13€/month and Play?
---
Yeah this is a really good point.  Back to the drawing board!
---
ugh horde fanbois are the worst.
---
No, that's what Moonkins are for. At least they can dance!
---
what do you mean? do you have some druid threat maths? i dont really see them doing more threat than wars without pummeler
---
But if they're dying in 12 seconds of an 18 second SW:P or dying in 12 seconds of a 24 second SW:P **the mana's already spent** for 0 benefit.
---
Why waste 2 talent points on something that has no benefit?
---
Have fun gearing 40 characters :)
---
Warlock is too cool. Only bummer at launch is no epic mount, but it's *some time* to 60, and it will be out only what, 4 months after launch? How many people actually have enough to buy the regular epic for other classes by then?
---
I just got smoked by a shaman on my paladin. Fucking ret and no slow kills you completely vs earth totem. BoF don't last long enough to burst them down. We were lvl 30'ish.
---
If there are nigh elves in alliance and undead in horde what is the issue with blood elves being in horde? However I guess a case can be made for them for either faction. Green eyes are important part of blood elves since their wc3 campaign.
---
Congrats on having a wife who also wants to play WoW Classic. I'm in the same boat, well sort of. I played back in the Vanilla days as an Alliance Warrior, but don't currently play. After I heard about classic, I had to somehow convince my wife to give WoW Classic a chance. 
---
My plan was simple.
---
Step 1: Convince wife to play video game.
---
Step 2: Convince wife to play on Alliance.
---
Step 3: Enjoy life with wife.
---
Ah ha! Step 1: Convince wife to play video game - Complete. To my surprise and miraculously I might add, she was "open" to the idea of playing WoW and actually somewhat excited. She had never played.
---
Now for the next part of the plan, Step 2: Convince wife to play on the Alliance... Fast forward a few months, she plays the BlizzCon demo and falls in love with a... SHAMAN! Now she wants main a Resto/Elemental Shaman. Well that threw things off a bit for me.... Step 2: Failed.
---
Step 3 really got me thinking... enjoy life with wife. I mean, I was already so lucky that she even wanted to try this game out anyway. After much soul searching and self bargaining I decided to bite the bullet and say "fuck the Alliance". I never played as the Horde and in all honesty I am now more excited now that I was before. We are going to Duo as a Warrior/Shaman tag team and I couldn't be more excited. We have even planned out all our alts together too. Also, we are rolling on a PVP server and didn't want to split time between the two factions. 
---
My advice would be "Enjoy life with wife". Roll on the Alliance and play with her. You may find you like it, especially if you've never played on the Alliance anymore. I'm rolling Horde so you can take my spot.
---
Yeah, you won't need to buy any expansions or anything, only make an account and pay the subscription. (At least, that's the current monetization model)
---
Try to convince her that, eventually, Blizzard may do TBC as well and that means BElves! Cam Clarke voices the males!! 
---
sure but a lot of guilds won't be tryharding...
---
DME runs with mining or they charge people to run dungeons 
---
If you plan to pvp more then Dwarf hands down. 
---
Night elves are just unevolved trolls.
---
If your wife doesn't recognize the superiority of sen'jin genetics then it is clear she isn't a worthy mate.
---
And that makes it just the more worthless to try to find over a decade later. 
---
No. In classic, your faction actually matters
---
It won’t be as bad as it sounds. I can gear my 35 clothies in mostly crafted stuff and be fine. Leveling will be the painful part lol
---
 I hadn't considered measuring the dailies on a loss/gain binary but after reading what you wrote I can see how that's a subtle but impactful difference. Thank you for taking the time to type all that out.
---
... and learn how to play effectively ...
---
Alright. I do want a game to fill the time till classic, but everything i try just has me unenthusiastic. End up just watching classic videos and kill a few mobs on a private server :P
---
Oh right so we did! Sorry a lot of threads on reddit ^^ i started talking about some psychology stuff in another and boi did that get replies. I'm EU and i'll prob go RP-PVP if it happens, else PVP. Still deciding, but loving warlock at the moment.
---
guys i was ret paladin main since wotlk. i love paladin lore , playstle, everything... but ppl told me that ret paladins suck in vanilla wow. is that true that only paladin spec is holy in classic? ill roll warrior or rogue then...:( its really sad for me. 
---
If you can't raid then pick what you like cos it won't matter.
---
And pre-dire maul release ?
---
Ive mained blood elf holy pally since release of tbc and love the horde. Unfortunately my love for paladins is stronger so im going alliance 
---
Nah rogues usually do the fight resets. Re invis and re engage is bread and butter vs warriors.
---
You will probably know your realm's price by the time you manage to level/gear up all your characters
---
O hell ya chicken in a raid is dope. Hook me up with that 3% crit baby
---
What makes me upset is that this isn't a troll post.
---
If you're leveling on a PvP server, you 100% want improved Psychic Scream and Improved Vampiric Embrace.
---
I did some math on it a while back, you can build for spell power and it shouldn't be way far off from the normal build. Actually "if" you could use serpent sting in raid spell power might even edge out using normal weapons but that isn't going to happen.

---
I might try to build a hunter this way for pvp at least, even if it isn't raid competitive, could be cool. 
---
Bro. Farming flask reagents and consumables is your dailies. Enjoy
---
It won’t matter because I won’t have the gear from raids to be competitive in PvP? So does that mean I must pick human to play combat swords in order to be brought into raids to get the gear to do well in PvP? 
---
Its about Tauren and Dwarves
---
Yeah this is correct.. and i also dont want them to reduce the cost of it... Vanillia is a game that makes you commit to your spec your roll... if you want to change you gotta pay a pretty penny, People dealt with it back then so can us.. 
---
IF they did Manage to lower respecing costs (which i hope they dont) it should decrease a small amount over a medium time like say 5g every 2 weeks so its still costly... but not as much! my opinon 
---
I didn't know that face was around in Vanilla. I thought they only added it later. Or maybe it's a different one in Vanilla.
---
Yeah I feel you. My druid has been tauren since vanilla, but I race changed him to zandalari after the patch hit, and I can't honestly say all of his gear doesn't just plain look better on a more normal upright character model.
---
I'll miss Org too, and all my Vanilla Horde nostalgia, but I guess a part of me also knows that you can't... REALLY play it all for the first time again, not truly. But I barely touched the Alliance side of the game in all the years then and since. Leveled an alt to 20 and race-changed to Alliance at 80 in Wrath, but all the leveling content and storylines from the Classic ear, the Alliance perspective on it is mostly unknown to me. I'd like to give that a shot.
---
Unfortunately, I'll be playing sub-optimally build wise, but that's just how the cookie crumbles. I know I want to play a Warrior because I remember dungeon tanks being stupidly hard to come across in Classic. But when it comes to Classic Alliance races, the only one I enjoy playing... is Gnomes. So a three-foot tank is in my future, I guess.
---
Yeah. Wouldn't even want my wife on my [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) friends list, let alone actually in game the same time I am. We have enough shit to argue about like dinner, please for the love of god NOT watching The Bachelor, and who's responsible for cleaning up after the puppy when it takes a dump on the couch. We don't also need to be shrieking at each other in arenas or raid wipes, thank you very much. 
---
Tolerant of yet removed from WoW is half the reason I married my wife in the first place!
---
Mad bc fat or ugly or both?
---
Misconception IMO. Warriors/Rogues don't scale any more than most other classes. Raid stats show that Mages and Warlock scale the most with better gear and Hunters the least. Rogues and Warriors are middle of the pack in terms of scaling.
---
u mad bruh
---
600$ a month. Seems like a dumb Investment for the hassle and very very little pay off. People won’t have and will not be paying those prices for a MC / Ony carry.

I can't believe no one on alliance wants to roll shaman...

---
Blizzard will ignore this feedback and later when the servers crash and they have to use cross realming, they will blame us for not letting them know in a constructive manner like their forums ahead of time. 
---
You're not good enough to succeed as a Shaman. Don't even try.
---
Well I know for warlock vs. rogue, as a personally known example, the rogue usually opens on you and you have to usually get a Void Sac shield on, or perhaps just Death Coil, into a possible Fear attempt, or most likely just Charm. Then you go to max distance, bandage/potion and reset the fight, restarting it with a Shadowbolt or Soulfire into DoTs.
---
Like many others here, I hate dailies.
---
The rep grinds in vanilla were a little more bland then daily-based rep grinds, but _I could do them on my own terms_. If I had a little less time one week, I could grind a bit more on the weekend. I could _catch up_, in many senses, to where I wanted to be with a particular rep.
---
The grinds were measured in hours, but I could do those hours whenever I wanted. Daily-based rep grinds are measured in days.
---
Dual-specc would make more sense than reduced cost. Anyway, it will probably stay as it used to. Otherwise people will go mad.
---
Cyka blyat?
---
Depends on what you mean by can't pvp well. Because they pvp just fine. They are exceedingly good in fact as you can use cleanse just as easily as a holy paladin. All of that being said. They are not optimized for dps. Which means while they are good and viable in pvp. They are not Optimal as a holy paladin is simply better. That being said if you get the gear. You can destroy people. 
---
No one cares about your race for PVE, unless you’re a dwarf priest. Pick dwarf though, stoneform is amazing. 
---
Soooo, what are you going to name your gnome with pink pigtails?
---
I posted the same thing like a months ago and that and a few other posts had a guy who just said, “get a life asshole hope no one responds to you”
---
nahh i can't stand dual spec.. i believe it should never be in the game.  so pay a price to do it. Maybe it makes more sense than lowered cost but still makes no sense to have i dunno i just think if any of the 2 are in vanillia its gunna hurt
---
I don’t see a need a for that
---
Do you mind just using auto-attack? That's pretty much what Ret Palas do in raids and that's why they're bad.
---
Don't worry, we treat our barmaids with respect here in Stormwind. The dwarves can get a bit rowdy, but that usually comes with better tips. Deep pockets those dwarfs have, figuratively speaking.
---
I would not expect anyone to pay anything for a carry because u have 3 choices
---
1 be in a capable guild which isn't asking much
---
2 pug which isn't asking much except might be harder to win the /roll
---
3 stop playing on a server if it doesn't have either of 1 or 2
---
But you might see people paying guilds (who take pugs to fill their last raid spots) for specific items if they happen to drop so that price depends on the person and item, etc.

---
It’s just slow paced and very repetitive . It’s not that bad. As long as you make your peace with that early you’ll have no issues. 
---
It’s the fact that holy is so good that retribution looks bad in comparison. It’s also the fact that warriors and rogues are indeed way better than a retribution paladin for the same effort put into the character. 
---
Sure, but if you can't kill gnomesz are you really a forsaken? Sounds more like dying  on the inside rather than being undead.
---
&gt; The alternative to 1.13+ is TBC servers.
---
I guess I disagree with the premise that there *has* to be something after Classic to move towards. I genuinely don't think there does. To me the alternative to 1.13+ isn't TBC...it's just doing nothing and letting Classic continue indefinitely - a museum/historical recreation of sorts with the knowledge and comfort  that we can always return and see it again when we need it.

Have you ever 69'd with a gnome? Pure Bliss.

I’m not doing it to make gold. I enjoy turning wow into an rts and I’m sure I’ll have no trouble making gold when I can just farm mc trash all day. Just figured if people are willing to pay for it I’d be happy to take their money 🤷‍♀️

Lok' + tar = Ogar

I'd say it's a good choice if you dedicate all your time to it. If you're split between multiple games I'd hold off till you can focus on it, but it doesn't sound like that's the case.
---
PoE's combat is like dragon age! It's all happening in real time, but you can pause anytime you like too. Some people don't like that, but they stay for the story anyway. Kinda like my qualms with witcher :P
---
My big three classes are Rogue &gt; Warrior &gt; Warlock
---
I wanna try tanking out for once, but I also wanna go Arms and be a BG god lol. And warlocks I've always kinda hated, but i want to try them out again and see if things changed.
---
I zug where I wanna!
---
Yeah, at least buy him dinner first. Can't imagine what his wife would think about it.
---
Regular mount is not on the GCD, pvpers or min/max players will want a reg mount
---
For some reason I love it lol, I don't  mind it. I leveled one pally like that on early WOTLK

They won’t be. I’d look at other options pal.

Farming strat live for orbs is always a good one, can usually reserve first orb as tank and then chances at other expensive shit too.
---
I too am strictly no changes, not in the sense that I don't think any positive changes can be implemented, it's just knowing where to draw the line and if everyone starts having their input then things can get wildly out of control. (slippery slope and all that)
---
But if I was allowed to make a few changes to the game and nobody else could then I'd up the server cap to 5k along with buffing end game content to make up for the fact that we will be starting with 1.12 talents and have a vastly superior knowledge of the raids, mechanics, gearing, talents etc on top of the skill level just generally being higher than it was 14 years ago. Although these are non blizzlike changes they would actually help make the game feel more blizzlike as the raids would be as challenging as we remembered them and we'd still have a strong dedicated playerbase well into the games life cycle once the tourists leave and the initial drop off that will inevitably happen happens. And no I couldn't give a fuck if buffing raids means that little Timmy can't raid as a moonkin because it's too shit and hampers progression.

YOU HAVE A WIFE THAT CAN PLAY POCKET HEALER PALADIN GO BE A BIG DICK WARRIOR 
---
Popular opinion: OPs opinion isn't unpopular.
---
I can't fault this cause it would be interesting how you automate these various things. Is it all macros? Is there programming to it? I have so many questions and follow ups.
---
IIRC, it was a short blink if you threw your hearthstone away first
---
Yeah I feel you. I can see how it would be nice to get every piece of loot without competition though. If people aren’t interested I can charge less since all that gear is going to get disenchanted if I don’t bring anyone.
---
Option C
---
yea! in classic theyre still working on creating the new plague
---
Popular opinion: Your "unpopular opinion" about OPs unpopular opinion about unpopular opinions not being actually unpopular, is not actually unpopular.
---
I think your little project will run into stiff competition from GDKP runs unless you sell a hefty amount of gear for a decent price.  
---
Lol what’s with the attitude?
---
Reroll to Alliance.
---
Make a Dwarf, be generally grumpy.
---
Refuse to talk in anything but Dwarvish
---
I just hope you record or livestream this because I’d watch for sure.  
---
 You are so going to play alliance. Welcome to being married :)
---
I used to use something like ElitistGroup, it was able to do notes and much more. It was kinda useless after lfg became a thing though. 
---
If you want to be a real gold farmer then you need to assess the needs of your server. Maybe felcloth is your best farm this week. 
---
But if you just want easy guaranteed solo gold farm that will be enough to get you by but not get you tens of thousands of gold excess, I do suggest something like those instance pickpocketing and chest looting routes.
---
My pleasure, thank you for being open to what you read - not a thing to be taken for granted, and speaks of character. Hopefully the industry will realise how fed up we are of malicious practices like this (did you know belgium is pursuing legal action towards loot boxes? On the argument that they are basically gambling for minors), and we can go back to getting good games - another thing is that they very much change the design of their games to subtly influence you towards spending money on micro transactions or premium editions. There is a lot to watch out for as a gaming consumer really
---
You can play alliance as well lol. Suck it up why play a fucking ugly looking character anyway lol. 
---
Sucks about not wanting to tank. I understand that it is stressful, but Warcraft YouTube content creator Frostadamus remarked on a survey filled on this sub-Reddit by 11,000+ people, and 61.3% said they'd D.p.S., 25.6% said they'd heal, and 13.1% said they'd tank. As a normal 5-player dungeon is one tank, one healer, and three D.p.S., that's obviously a 20/20/60 split, not 13/26/61 (rounding up). 
---
Some of those healers ought to come tank, if these numbers stay steady. Then again, projections are projections, whereas actual is actual. There's no telling how many people get bored and quit the class they claim they'll main.

That's not no changes, you took 5 mages 
---
Why is this nsfw?
---
Exactly why I cannot play on a PvP server, though I do see the appeal to some people.
---
Thanks for the story, that was a fun read!  Sorry it was at your expense.  :(
---
Now compare the zeppelin with the Deeprun Tram...
---
I love horde as much as the next guy, short of a for the horde tattoo, but vanilla horde kinda sucks. Aesthetics suck, towns suck, leveling sucks a lot of the time although not always. 
---
Play ally with her then when she's not playing play your horde.
---
Some of the absolute best guides still exist on the older and popular private servers.
---
Always keep written guides available for reference. Youtube videos are good too, but you will be able to reference and retain written guide information easier. Tons of macros listed as well in any good hunter guild so written guides will be your best source.
---
I won't post links to private server forums though.
---
How dare you marry someone who prefers Alliance ?!
---
This should be your very first question at any date.
---
D, option should work out.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
It is boring if you treat it as the other classes imo - i took the risks with the paladin and it paid off, those prot specs with mass pulls? Do them, you can simply ask your healer how they would like to the pace to go. 
---
Ret/prot specs for solo mass pulls are fun. It is the risky stuff you can do and basically just get away with anything once. 
---
Yeah, my thinking is that ppl with lots of gold to pay for a carry probably don't need a carry. Good luck, though!
---
I mean, Trolls ears are pretty pointy.
---
I was going to say human would be amazing at least for dueling other rogues, for stealth perception, but then again stone form or whatever would clear poisons and drop damage taken by 10%, so that is pretty legit.
---
All of that just has to do with dueling other rogues, lol.
---
For min-maxing pve, human has that sword specialization, which is nice and non-trivial.
---
Multiboxing software just sends my key presses/ mouse clicks to every window. In a world where dps rotations are literally one button I can basically just bind that spell to everything and play my tanks normally. 
---
Healing in the early raids is super simple so I’m just going to have one priest in each group and cast prayer of healing whenever I need raid healing and constantly spam tank heals.
---
Time is money, friend. It may take slightly longer, but you'll be fine.
---
I main'ed a warrior in vanilla. Do plenty of dungeon runs. You'll make friends, and get plenty of things to AH for funds. You get plenty of runecloth, greens, BoEs, and if you're lucky, your runs will frequently have an enchanter who can disenchant the greed items.
---
faKE nEWs
---
If you ever find the time to attend a raid here and there, you will do just fine as a Dwarf. A good NE/Dwarf/Gnome rogue will do better dps than an average Human rogue. The only guilds that would turn you away are super serious hardcore guilds that have, let's say, only 2 or 3 more slots to fill and they want only min/maxers.
---
If your focus is PvP, then really humans are arguably the worst choice on alliance. Night Elves with the bonus stealth level, highest base agility and 1% extra dodge, Dwarves with stoneform and Gnomes with escape artist are all superior to Perception.  
---
Stoneform only removes bleeds, poisons and diseases (such as Devouring Plague from an Undead Priest). It does not remove standard magic DoT's (every Warlock DoT, SWP from a Priest, Ignite from a Mage, Insect Swarm from a Druid, etc...). It's best use is against Hunters, Warriors and other Rogues and can be the difference in 1v1's against those classes.
---
I'm in the process of making my own nostalgia playlist of songs i listened to back in the day! This will help me loads in the quest for finding my favorurites! Thanks alot! 
---
What is the pserver druid playstyle compared to vanilla?
---
Nice work. I plan on having my own nostalgia inducing 04-07 playlist ready. My own personal one with memories tied to zones. Can't wait. 
---
Are you red shirt guys dad?
---
Thanks man a lot of great tunes are from this period ! 
---
sucks ass, you wont get groups unless you are healer, mages steal your cloth gear, warriors steal your plate gear.   
---
respeccing from holy to ret is 50g a week   
---
lvl your first few points into ret untill you get the movespeed buff, then put the rest into holy and pug dungeons as much as you can, it is faster than solo grinding because after 4 mobs you run out of mana.   
---
at 60  in naxx gear you are unkillable healer, and can memespec aoe farm or ret dps but dps will still suck.   
---
reckbomb will be nerfed in retail so lvling prot is useless. 
---
I did some post processing investigation guys, confirmed my suspicions. [Illuminati](https://i.imgur.com/s8wLR0z.png)

Nice, 9% upvotes. Haven't seen that yet! :D

More Warriors than Mages, but wouldn't be far off that's for sure. 
---
What makes this so funny is that the basic strategy works, doesn't it?
---
No what's cringy is saying people like asmongold, a regular nerd that does twitch streams, is the reason wow is shit is the real cringe.  
---
Wow is shit because blizzard is shit.  
---
Blizzard is shit because Activision has poisoned them over the last decade.
---
Sounds like total madness and I can’t wait to see how you pull it off mate. 👍 Please give us all an update in a year. 
---
It’s not an attitude I’m just being honest with you. Your confusing your defensiveness with an attitude. I’m simply disagreeing with you. 
---
I liked the dailies in WotLK. Argent Dawn story was good.
---
Cost?
---
Your; girlfriend, job, social life, health. Etc 
---
🙈
---
Pally in wotlk was the most OP class. Was very fun to level 
---
Me it was the other way around. It was my ex wife which convinced me to play WOW. I lost a bet and that bet  was to play wow for one hour back in vanilla. Err that last until i quit wrath of the lich king lol. I was FPS type person back then i didnt play an fps game for 4 years whilst playing WOW LOL.
---
There are indeed counters in 1v1 pvp. This is softened a hell of a lot due to gear progression and tons of consumable options and of course Engineering.
---
You will always hear those vocal pvp'rs playing the normal pvp solo classes like rogue and mage, talking about how easy they kill most other classes. Then they face rare class builds played by good player and they get cake walked.
---
Mage/Rogue and Feral is one such example. There was 2 occasions where I could not convince a couple players of those 2 classes that Ferals were a good counter to their classes. They just rarely encountered well geared and well played ferals and considered them easy kills.
---
I quickly convinced them that they were mistaken once we dueled.
---
You're glad because someone you know nothing about has been dealt a tough hand?  
---
Your own life must be really dogshit to take satisfaction in that sort of thing. You should probably quit video games, get off the internet and do some self reflection to improve your own situation.  
---
Hey guys i think i have settled on a hunter(Horde) but i cannot seem to decide between tauren or orc.... My main focus will be pvp with a side order of dungeons/raiding. I really like both of these races lore wise, please let me know what you feel would be a better choice and why. 
---
hahaha you think asmongold has a hard life
---
legit cringe bro
---
Would listen to this on repeat for farming for raids back in the day - the music is built to calm nerves and pass time
---
Feared? I'm sure you're thinking of Mind Control
---
Two stories.
---
1. I just hit 60 with my NE Hunter and was feeling good. Saw a level 51 troll hunter around the plague lands and tried to gank him.
---
He continued to repeatedly either kill me, or kite his way away just enough over the next few hours.
---
It was really a wake up call, and led me to respec from BM to MM, learn to kite and jump shoot effectively.
---
2. The second is just every duel against any paladin ever. The only success I ever had against a paladin was with viper sting and trying to OOM them. They have just far too much health, armor, and healing to bring down. 
---
In a real duel you cant run away, so Paladino's are pretty much the best. In world pvp though, they need to be able to catch your kill.
---
Has your wife not heard the good word of Thrall?
---
I saw the survey graph down there indicating about 13.6% of the 11,000+ people declared mage main, but I'm for sure going mage to begin with. The primary reason for me is AoE farming in order to fund the rest of my alts. I feel like a frost mage AoE farming can influence a fair share of the auction house economy, as well as wanting to be one of the first enchanters to fill out their book. A mage's ability to portal from capitol to capitol makes selling enchants easier. Creating the first decent wands/cloth armor for myself and others will also be satisfying with both enchanting/tailoring combo. The ability to portal around will eventually be solid for commuting to quest, and creating food instead of spending silver/gold on it is appealing, as well.
---
I am hoping that the two crafting professions, though gathering professions equal certain gold, will allow me to deal damage faster and farm harder to compensate. We shall see, but mage is looking 90%+ to be my first choice.
---
Cool thanks.  This is a huge gold sink.  
---
How? I thought priests only have one fear with a 60s cd? 
---
You don't need to apologize, you aren't supposed to need a lawyer present to talk about wow, but it does happen sometimes. I will mention any other items I think of that meet your list. Engineering is obviously bigger than all other professions combined, maybe start with looking at actual lootable recipes? All in all there really aren't too many items in a given profession to sort through if you are confident it's a full list.
---
Solo target healing yes. All around Priest from Aoe healing. 
---
Gank her in real life IMO
---
&gt;Improved Vampiric Embrace.
---
Each his own, but  Improved Vampiric Embrace looks like a waste given the cost vs benefit.  I remember this too back then.  
---
What I desire/want is to not have a hard time finding groups because there are 20 of the same class also vying for the group in trying to get into.
---
Disregarding his own health issues, he has to take care of his mum every single day. He's had to watch her health deteriorate every day of his life, that would wear anyone down.
---
Legit, I once saw a guy on mmochampion claiming he plays since Vanilla, and "Vanilla was absolutely horrible game, TBC was even worse, WotLK was better but still bad, Cata was horrible again, and only with MoP it started getting good".
---
Meanwhile I'm like: Bruh, you are saying you kept playing absolutely horrible game for 8 years? Wat? 
---
just play a dwarf cos they're hilarious, and then duel alliance all the time.  best of both worlds
---
Gnome! 
---
jk, Dwarf is a little above human but both are very good choices. 
---
We should play together as all I will be doing is trying to hit R14 and be a pest on ganking/camping
---
Lol it works in molten core and Ony since the mechanics are so basic. The only challenging thing people might run in to would be decursing, but I’ll have 28 mages so I can decurse the entire raid in 2 globals.
---
Is dwarf also important for holy paladin?
---
Let it out and know that many of us (myself included) are right there with you! I think that's the most helpful thing at this point. Much better than my coping mechanism which is endlessly watching wow classic YouTubes at work lol
---
yeah with infinite money
---
a direct upgrade and easier than everyone who has to do that with low funds
---
keep yourself safe
---
I believe stuck in vanilla just ported your character forward after like an 8 seconds cast time. It's how you were able to get passed invisible walls like getting behind org AH
---
When did he say he had anything against centipedes?
---
Ventrilo was quite popular in Russia somewhere between 2008 and 2012. Not sure about rest of the Europe. At least in guilds where I was playing.
---
:o true tho
---
Being loyal to a faction is part of the fun.  
---
Howl
---
Anyway this is a waste of time, good luck with whatever you have going on.
---
Well, when dual spec was first introduced it cost 1000 gold just to unlock the ability to use it. So in a way, people paid a very hefty sum to have it. Aside from the obvious benefit of being able to have two specs from that point forward at no additional cost (individual spec respecs still cost 50g at cap), it also allowed players to load their bars/icons instantly with each, rather than have to take screenshots and swap out all their macros.
---
That aside, this is definitely NOT a feature we will see in Classic, so the #nochanges crowd can rest easy.
---
40 Characters? $600 a month for WoW?! Are you hoping to make actual money off this or just really want to solo raids?
---
You’re in for a fantastic journey my friend.
---
bye bye cringelord
---
Professor PLUMS
---
I can't stand paying to respecc, so we differ there. I won't be respeccing more than once or twice after I hit 60.
---
Ah so it doesn’t remove all dots but it does remove Devouring plague. Not as strong as originally thought. But as you said, it’s good against hunters and warriors which can be tough for rogues to beat so that’s nice 
---
Show me footage of a vanilla priest killing anything within 2 levels of it in levelling gear in under 12 seconds ( over level 20 of course). 
---
Okay I am just going to ask this neutrally. You seem to be ignoring that not everyone has a rogue, and not every lock can be carried with you to the capital cities. Doors and chests in blackrock depths are one example. In those cases you absolutely need to have keys. It matters for people rolling feral and hunter especially because they might be actively avoiding rogues to make loot easier to share. Keys are consumable, why would anyone use keys in a city full of rogues who often advertise needing skillups, but this seems to be your primary example of when and where keys were used?
---
anime tiddies
---
If you are stuck in combat you cannot mount up.. and she did not use any dots to harm me. As lvl 60, there’s no way I can fight here. This process was not short. We are talking several hours of my day.
---
Live to win 100 hour version
---
Downvoted? I WILL SHOW THAT GUY! *upvotes and nods in satisfaction*
---
I must be a weirdo, I like all the female races of the Horde. (Though Troll only has that one pretty face, rest are ew.) 
---
I mean I'd stay on my private server. Sure it's not the *real* thing but it's pretty close. And I'll be in tbc soon enough. Plus it's free.
---
I understand where you're coming from in regards to splitting the player base up, but this is what a lot of anti-vanilla retail players said would happen if Classic servers were to be released to begin with.
---
TBC is my favorite version of the game. I know a lot of flawed design philosophies we're introduced in TBC that ruined the game for a lot of Vanilla diehards; e.g flying, arena balancing, and dailies. But none-the-less, I love the lore, the class balance, the raids, the dungeons, all of it.
---
When classic was announced, I was definitely on the #changes team, but after talking to people on this sub-reddit, I changed my mind and fully embraced #nochanges. I fought for that, and believed those ideals, even if there were things I would have like to be introduced (raid tuning, class adjustments, guild banks). I fought so that players like you could enjoy Vanilla WoW the way you remembered it, despite some of it's flaws.
---
All I want is for each of to enjoy the game we love from our past. Please just leave TBC alone.
---

---
Oh yeah, I just remembered some of his stories about stealing shit and showing up on lan houses totally stinking.
---
Damn, the stories vanilla wow gave us lol
---
I’d make oatmeal.
---
Orc has 5% stun resist, which is why I’m leaning toward them as well. 
---
Do Tauren have the aoe stun in classic? I love them aesthetically, so that could be viableish. But if you’re min/maxing, the stun resist is super OP and only makes you more of a pain for rogues to deal with
---
1. Yes
---
2. Yes with help from 2 party/raid members. You can only summon outside or inside a dungeon, not from outside to inside. You either run out or get teleported to entrance if you leave group.
---
3. No
---
That fear with a long CD that runs around in any direction? Haha, made more sense with Mind Control in my mind
---
I take it when I'm leveling PvP only because in PvP you need every advantage you can get. When I engaged in PvP on my priest, I'd throw up every dot I could, including Devouring Plague, then burn them down with Mind Blast and Mind Flay. Improved Vampiric Embrace can straight up win you a fight against a warrior, because of how much it takes to kill them. 
---
If by endgame you mean Naxx, sure. I say play what you want. You also need hunters for certain bosses in naxx to kite mobs. It can be done by a shaman but weaving frost shock and earthbind is a pain and waaay easier for a hunter to do
---
Nah, just for fun
---
From what I've read, you do need to travel to the entrance of the dungeon, yes. Warlocks can summon you there though, but meeting stones don't have that functionality in vanilla. 
---
I also don't know if there is such a thing as porting out. I suspect, but don't know for sure, that lock summoning is a one way ticket. Should they summon you into an instance, assuming that's even possible, you'll have to simply run out and end up at the entrance if you want to leave, and would probably need to make your way back to where you were before the summon on your own.
---
Not sure about the group finder tool though. From my TBC days all I remember was using trade and general chat a lot...
---
Same, I was so invested into the game I kept playing because it had to get better eventually right? Never did 
---
Check the video on Frostadamus' YouTube home page.
---
I'd make a post on here asking if anyone ever wondered 'what will happen after naxx?'.
---
1. If there is no Warlock in the party to summon, then yes.
---
2. Yes, but they require two additional party members present for a successful summon. So in reality, only two party members would ever be summoned.
---
3. When you finish a dungeon you can either a) hearthstone out if off cooldown, b) ask a Mage for a portal to a major city IF there's a mage in your party AND they are over level 40 (the level required to port other people), or you can run out of the dungeon, which will place you on the other side of the entrance in whatever zone that dungeon is in.
---
4. Blizzard introduced a very weak pairing system where you could talk to any Innkeeper and that NPC would show you some dungeons around your level. You could "queue" for these but the system itself, to my recollection, never worked.
---
Zone chat, general chat and/or trade chat are the primary ways to find pickup groups outside of your guild.
---
yep definitely
---
Hoping they remake the opening trailer like WC3 Reforged.
---
Then why are you even here if you don't want to play Classic?
---
Yeah, she did mind control too lol.
---
Because I'm playing vanilla on my private server. I don't see the issue.
---
R14? Yeah I won’t be on your level! But I am up for some world pvp/fat ambush crits and then vanishing 
---
1. There were "meeting stones" but you couldn't summon anyone, they just marked a relatively safe spot you could gather before heading into the dungeon.
---
2. Locks can summon.  When you "port" out of the dungeon, you end up at the appropriate place in the world (the dungeon exit).
---
3. If I remember correctly usually there is a chat channel you can join to make groups, but people use trade chat too.
---
This subreddit isn't about vanilla on pservers. It's about Classic. Go to /r/wowservers if you want to talk about that.
---
I've done it on private servers.. i mean Vanilla is super slow paced anyways so i played a Rogue got to 39 decided to swap to pally (well because i don't wanna farm the gold) and yah you white damage EVERYTHING got to level 43 and was just burnt out.. didn't really wanna quest anymore it didn't help i did it as holy but i got instances to heal much faster... its NOT that bad but honestly it isnt that great either. Just Boring cause your not using any spells.
---
Awesome playlist dude!

---
Keep in mind leveling in wotlk you were probably killing mobs much faster. They have low downtime and are hard to kill, but they really have horrid kill speed in vanilla.
---
I'm also on that reddit. But I'll still be here because regardless of where I play, I still love the game and play the game.
---
Fine, here's an actual unpopular opinion:
---
They should change Molten Core to make it harder and then compensate for it by giving players access to tier 0.5 at launch.
---
This thread triggered me.
---
Memeing but: equip nightfall and spam wingclip. Congrats!
---
But if everyone does it, are downvoted posts really unpopular?
---
Was paladin from vanilla start to end, raised through naxx. Can confirm, Ret is not fun in raids, nor optimal . I was holy for raids, then I would respec Prot/Ret for PVP to have a change and more active skills. 
---
Holy - you cast flash of light nonstop in raids. That’s it outside of the occasional blessings 
---
Ret- you auto attack in raids, judge and re apply seal. That’s it
---
Prot- you don’t raid, no taunt and terrible threat gen. 
---
Prot/Ret - you love pvp, you can 1v3 rogues and warriors that outgear you. And you have more active abilities 
---
I loved my pally, but I won’t be rolling one again
---
Honestly?  Except for bathroom duties, I don't do the same thing every day.  That includes reddit, normal work, driving, chores, etc.  
---
All those dailies were to players were money making and online time sinks for epics / mounts.  They got old after the second day, and unless I specifically wanted something from it, I didn't do it.  
---
I have run Scholo 5x daily for drops; BRD and Strath, DM Tribute runs, etc.  But we were a group of friends then, helping one another out, not just strangers in the dungeon finder doing a daily instance -- in complete silence.
---
I plan to follow the route over on http://www.vanilla-questing.me/
---
That has you going through Duskwood, Ashenvale, STV, Hillsbrad, and then Arathi.  Nice and easy to follow.  
---
I can't comment if classic or retail is the better "hook", as I started in Legion. Did get my BFF hooked within a week though. Honestly I just excitedly told her about how much fun I was having and the little discoveries like mounts and talents that were cool, and the selling point was the "free to play" up to level 20 so her own curiosity sold it.
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Hi. I'm doing something like that too. Do you wanna exchange playlists for songs?
---
It's pretty close.
---
Stun resist on the Orcs is great, but you're also a Hunter, sort of considered the Rogue-counter in BG's, and that's where most stuns come from.
---
Tauren have the War Stomp, which is great when anyone gets on you.
---
I would go with whichever you prefer.
---
Lol, this depends a LOT on how many tanks there are. Also any group with a druid healer should want a pally.
---
I fail to see how you ever run out of mana while doing dps.. Are you spamming conc on singletarget?
---
Sorry you either have no clue, or you are just plain bad
---
My God it was so obvious the whole time...
---
1. There are meeting stones but you can’t use them to summon other members. I think that was introduced in BC
---
Brought to you by: original thoughts. 
---
As mentioned in a similar thread, also posted today, you should introduce her to the gym and then step back as just let her play. Answer questions that she has but if she’s going to enjoy it, it’ll just be on her terms. 
---
I’d level a main and then play the alt when she’s playing. 
---
Also watch out because she might break up with you and move across the country to bang the guild leader 
---
I always play RP-PVE I like to do BGs, I like to flag up and attack south shore but I also like to fuck off and do other things without people fucking with me.
---
Play exclusively female dwarves, they are so vile she has to change her mind. 
---
&gt; I'm afraid there are alot of people who will get caught up in the hype but not have the attention span to stay around.
---
And where exactly are you getting this from? The vast majority of people I see post here know that it can be VERY grindy and rewards take effort to get.
---
Nah man, it’s worth every penny. 
---
Veteran players from said unnamed server are in for a rude awakening on official Classic. What's going to happen is folks PvPing in their PvE spec during raid progression, and then raiding in a PvP spec once the tier is on farm. Respeccing likely occurring in this cyclic manner. This is however a very large part of what made Vanilla...Vanilla.
---
Even the most hardcore of players who attend raid nights two or three times a week, will not be able to afford to respec four/five times a week. Anyone going for rank 10+ is in for a very long grind.
---
I’d be happy with a hastily scribbled date on a faded post-it note :/
---
Plottwist: I'll be the guild leader
---
See you in Classic!

Also, "a lot". You're welcome.

That's not true.  Three is the most common: one hunter in every melee DPS group to buff them.  Also provides flexibility with tranq rotations and kiting.
---
Here's your answer.
---
Roll both. When you play alone, play your horde toon. When you play together, play your night elf.
---
/bow
---
Sure maybe this is not the target audience for this but I'm pretty sure there are people here too who are gonna be super hyped for months untill it releases and then play two weeks. Downvote if you want I don't care 
---
I'm sorry but you are completely misunderstanding what I am trying to say. Warriors in high threat gear or Druid tanks with Manual Crowd Pummelers is min-maxing. A necessary tradeoff for this min-maxing is sacrificing mitigation.

Lok’tar ogar. Gank her.

Ah yes you are right. Forgot about warlocks and Pallas TBH. Wasn’t that many good locks that I remember on the alliance side but the few I remember were really good! RIP wotf tho haha

Check to see if there are any Wireless ISPs (WISP) in your area. They're popping up more and more in rural areas thanks to being relatively inexpensive. Latency is actually pretty good, prices are usually pretty good, bandwidth is most likely going to depend on if they put too many customers on too few radios.

Break up with her, move across the country and bang the guild leader?
---
The game only gets better during the second half, you can do everything you did before and new raids. Tons of people who jumped in the second half raided, they just started at MC and worked their way up.
---
Holy shit talk about first world problems. Support group for people too hyped for a fucking game 
---
Back in my day I got mine to play by asking for her help. I told her I needed to level fast to be able to play with my friends and hunters level very fast. I then told her I hate playing hunters and asked if she would help me level. Well being my significant other she may not have wanted to play wow but, she did want to help me. 
---
Also I selected hunter knowing women gravitate to hunter and warlock for some reason. Also and this is very important though I know it to be heresy. Your gonna need to pick a pve server and play Alliance. Girls generally don't like it when people attack them without consent and they hate the ugly horde models.
---
With these conditions met. It wasn't long before it went from her helping me to her constantly asking me for help. She forgot pretty fast the whole reason she made a toon was for me and fell in love with the game. The key was not to force her to play a game she didn't want to play. It was to convince her to help me and to let wow seduce her on it's own.
---
I'm considering to play a Feral Druid (Cat) in PvP. Are they any good? Can they burst? Are they overshadowed or countered by other classes? 
---
Then they shouldn't be casual and expect top tier rewards? 
---
Madseason makes some good videos. A lot of this one is just rambling and saying a lot of the same things over and over.

Roll priest, mind control her over to horde, save her soul.
---
you talking my language yoo! add me! Fearz#1153
---
It's not a serious concern. It will be fine. Breath
---
But they weren't the optimal way? All of those things you mentioned still exist and the right spec or group can make more from them per hour than doing dailies.
---
And even if dailies were optimal all it takes is a number tweak on the rewards to change that. Dailies were limited as well, farming is endless.
---
The existence of dailies doesn't mean there is no decision about how you would obtain money.
---
I remember a group of horde trying to gank me, but they were my level and my level 60 friend was coming to pick me up for a dungeon run.... it didnt end well for them.
---
Lemme go over to r/classicwow to tell people that they're not gonna enjoy the game. That'll show em.
---
Trust me, we know what we want. We think we do, and we do. Years of asking for Classic has proven that point.

To be fair, TBC desperate-mana-addicts enslave-and-torture-a-Naaru blood elves fit well with the Horde’s theme of survival.

Justizcar 29 twink Pally.  I just couldn’t ever get enough dps to consistently down him. As a combat rogue twink that was pretty hard to swallow.

I’m playing on a new pserver that was released over the weekend and the nostalgia is definitely there and it’s awesome to see a whole bunch of lower levels running wailing caverns and questing in the barrens. With that said, leveling is very long and tedious but I have come to realize that it’s a good thing. You are much more excited to get a piece of green gear and even more ecstatic or cruel barb drops for you as a rogue since it’s a weapon you’ll keep for many levels and you’ll definitely notice the upgrade.
---
Retail has conditioned us to try to reach max level as soon as possible to experience the end game content but vanilla was more about taking it slow and questing and doing dungeons along the way. I am barely level 20 with 18 hours already played and it’s definitely going slow but I have more attachment to this temporary private server character than I did with my boosted lvl 110 on legion. 
---
I leveled a shockadin as my first toon to 60.... was awesome. Exorcism was my second favorite spell after holy shock 😊😊😊
---
she sucks your dick, dont be stupid. Play Alliance.
---
I came in to ask what the hell that is 
---
Didn’t someone solo Azuregos with mend pet once? 
---
An easy fix is to just manually assign stuck locations around the entire world map. Where a player gets ported to a pre-determined location when the unstuck function is used. I.e use it anywhere in the Ironforge throne room, and you get ported to the middle of the room. Use it anywhere in the crossroads, and you get ported to in front of the inn. Use it anywhere in a battleground, and you get ported to the initial spawn location.  
---
Make a few thousand port points across the map to combat any attempts at exploiting the system.  
---
Remember, the players are utter bastards and will exploit anything exploitable.
---
Exactly, that was what I was trying to say just it came out a bit non diplomatic..oh well
---
U know about something called know ur threat? DPS has threat lowering skills. Threat is never an issue with good players. Outside of a few encounters.
---
If you have kids with ADHD who need to reach max level as soon as possible to get gear that is all shiny and glowing without any effort, they will have retail for that. Vanilla is slow and a big part of the game is to progress through different zones and dungeons. You will actually get excited when you get a new blue weapon drop from deadmines or scarlet monastery because you’ll use it for days , whereas in Retail, you dump it in hours.
---
Sylvanas**
---
Played as Alliance since day one and I can still remember the name of your traitor Banshee Queen and current goddamn Warchief better than you. 
---
Not to mention you've just disrespected the most stoic and responsible of all of the Horde races by attempting to shame their capital city. Thunderbluff, Baine and Cairne Bloodhoof will always have my respect, as do the Darkspear tribe.
---
Were it not for the reckless actions of the Forsaken and the Orc's stubborn hunger for glory and fame, feebly disguised as 'honor', the Horde and the Alliance may have seen peace. 
---
Your pride and thirst for revenge is what makes you outcasts. 
---
Coincidentally, both of your volatile races are not of this world. Trolls and Tauren are native to Azeroth and surprisingly enough, they are the only two races in the Horde that have the sense enough to be civil.
---
Aww thanks babe! For the Horde!
---
And to OP- here is a plan. Tell us all her character name. We will pose as alliance scum and make fun of her pointy ears, steal her mobs, etc, then you can be like "Love of my life, alliance ppl are snobs, let's go play Horde and kill them all."
---
Or.... just tell her she is so pretty irl that she needs to be "ugly" in wowbalance the universe.
---
That was not my intention. Just trying to calibrate the expectations a bit. We will for sure have a bunch of hyped people playing for two weeks and then never logging. I'm not saying everyone here is like that though.
---
That sucks bad. I once went over a year without internet in Winnummuca Nevada, living just a mile outside the coverage. I got through with offline Skyrim. Two weeks before we moved we were notified that the local ISP was expanding to include our house. 
---
So, maybe contact the local ISP and pick their brains on thetheir expansion plans? You never know.
---
I don't see a reason to get mad about using this occasionally. 
---
Elemental was a viable pvp option for vanillla? I thought only ench was. How does it play?
---
No, the specific reason people say Dwarf Priest and not just Priest is that Priests in Vanilla had specific racial spells that were unique to each race, and Dwarf's Priest racial skill is far and away the best Priest racial in the game. 
---
Gonna listen to bandas and cumbias 
---
^ There are never enough tanks or healers, a lot of that has to do with Classic both tanking and healing was a lot more challenging.                     
---
             
---
If you 100% want to DPS maybe play a Mage, they are always highly sought after because of having ranged good CC + Water/Food and they are almost always top DPS.             
---
              
---
If you want to play a highly under played sought for class, pick Druid, just know youll sooner or later wind up healing
---
all of alliance is racist, change my mind
---
Brings me back to my noob days when I legitimately had to open a stuck ticket.
---
I jumped into the Great Forge. Then I went back in as a spirit. No option to return to graveyard back then...
---
why warlocks especially on ally side? How does ally side differ from hored ethere?
---
Open her eyes and let her see the truth. Elves are just ugly trolls. They’ve moved away from their true forms and therefore aren’t cute in the eyes of Azeroth herself anymore. What’s cute in carrying meat knives taped around your head?
---
If non of your options work: A human is just a Forsaken in the making. Think of it as waiting to be harvested, like a good wine but with organs instead of grapes. Train to be the best, because the Forsaken demand the best. It might take a long time before you join the ranks of the master race, but remember: patience, discipline. 
---
Just go alliance, you can’t capture some of the new to the game nostalgia if you never played alliance back then.
---
looks like poop sock and fapkins

Meming aside, has anyone noticed trends of the types of players that play each race? For the upcoming vanilla re-release sort of on the fence of which faction to pick. In terms of starting areas / racials / looks of races, they all have strengths imo and none that really draw me.
---
Moreso, if I'm locking myself into a faction, I would rather pick one for a specific type of players I'd be playing around.
---
I know this is broad and maybe not answerable, but if anyone's played on both factions on a server and can say which they prefer for reasons, let me know
---
Because I consider it 100% cheating and I think you should get banned for using that exploit.

When I hit 30 on my Druid, I was like, "Fuck ya!  I am a lightning bolt of speed!" I had been waiting for that moment for so long.  I had said, "I'm going to run from the bottom of Kalimdor all the way to the northern tip at Mach V.  It'll be a great celebration".
---
It was just 40% faster, of course, haha.  Though I felt faster, going from Tauren to a low-to-the-ground cheetah, I did not make it much past thousand needles before giving up and telling myself that I would do it later ;)

I like the way you put that. 
---
Best thing you can do is become proficient at what ever class you chose, be courteous and patient and stand out amongst others of your class. Be social, make friends and it's a cake walk, just about every time I logged I always got whispered by people I've ran with before asking if I was busy.               
---
This isnt retail, dont play like shit or talk shit and it shouldnt be an issue 
---
Island Expeditions are fine and even good... in PvP mode. 
---
They are kings of flag carrying in WSG. They are also great in the hands of someone who plays them correctly, but pretty easy to kill when played badly.
---
Lol when you put it that way...

Get her to try a Tauren. She'll fall in love with Mulgore.

I honestly liked playing as alliance more in vanilla because I liked the earlier zones more.  They felt more “alive”, I guess.  
---
Though I do prefer the horde classes.  But sadly, I can’t have both. 
---
people always gave me shit for playing an orc rogue because they weren't rogue-like so my 14 year old self remade it to undead and i always hated myself for that lol
---
So he learned to count instead?
---
I won't hate on you, because I know where this is coming from.  In truth, it will never have **all** of the mystique of the original, because we've done it before.  However, my hope is that it's like a good book that always gives something new to its reader, even if they've read it many times before.
---
My only hope is that I don't get distracted by others *racing* to 60 and world-first Rag kills and who have already leveled to 60 30 times on a private server.  It will be *really* hard to just enjoy the process with the time that I have, but that's the goal.
---
Well said!
---
It was added in Wrath.
---
Yes.  I want to be able to as much or as little as I want in a given day without feeling obligated to complete a prescribed number of daily ~~chores~~ quests.
---
PvP-minded people are less likely to roll warlock on alliance due to WoTF.
---
I wasn't pointing out any specific specs it was just a short non-structured paragraph about some feral stuff. Also, in some specs faerie fire and bear is a direct counter to any rogue making druids their worst nightmare. And as for clothies a pure feral spec in vanilla could very well 2-3 hit an unsuspecting cloth in world pvp. Here's a pvp video demonstrating the true potential of feral https://youtu.be/djzrjTyJsPI and it's 1vX capabilities.
---
Don't know why this topic is coming up so much today but, here is my answer. Firstly talk to her if she plays it's almost 100% she will want to play Allie and as this is her first rodeo. She will almost 100% want to play on a pve servers. These two things may be uncomfortable for you but, I do find being Allie and being Pve tend to be the biggest factors in having a GF play.
---
As far as class goes. Every girl I have ever met in game with the exception of 1 has played a Hunter or Warlock. I would start there. As far as getting her to play. Rather then pressuring her to play. Ask for her help. Ask her if she would be willing to play with you to help you level. I find girls are far more willing to help men they love. Then they are willing to play games they may only hold a passing interest in. Then let classic work it's magic and seduce her.
---
I didn't even make this connection when I read the article earlier, but I think the general argument against the dungeon finder is it ruined the need to communicate and the sense of community, and not the fact it made things easier.  
---
There's no such thing as over hyping the best game ever made, sorry. Of course, there may be millions of ppl who try it and don't like it but the classic community is only expressing their love honestly. We aren't lying and saying that you don't have to work long and hard to achieve. We are saying that we liked it when "the grind" was that way. If u do try it and dislike it, u can't say we didn't warn u, lol.
---
Hybrids shine in 5 mans. Druids, Paladins, and even Shaman can actually off-tank mobs and keep them off a healer. Multi-target tanking is tough for Warriors so this can be really useful. Hybrids also throw out heals when people take unexpected damage or when the healer runs out of mana. Plus, everyone loves Innervate, Blessings, and totems. 
---
If I had my pick of classes: I would always take one single-target damage dealer, one multi-target damage dealer, and one hybrid.
---
Me: Hey, wanna play?  
---
Her: Well I have no choice because I'm your hand.  
---
Nice b8 8/8
---
Because fear is just a crutch new warlocks lean on. Once you learn your class you’ll hardly ever use fear. And you certainly never use it against a Mage, because now you’re just asking to get locked out and shattered on. 
---
Idk despite the naysayers I can see people paying for carries. Theres some really competitive items in MC that warriors die for. BRE and onslaught girdle come to mind. Both being bis for arguable the entire game. But I really cant say what people would be willing to pay. Imo youll get more people buying later in the game when theyre fed up sleeping through the raid and losing the item to someone else. Or maybe they want it on an alt and have the capital to finance it.
---
If I had the gold I would pay to have an alt that used a lot of gear from mc just get it all. Classes like hunter, rogue, priest all use full t1 happily. Perditions blade and core hound tooth are also the bis daggers till aq. Theres a market there for sure. 
---
Make a dwarf character and constantly mock the elf, but play Alliance with her. That's how I would go with it.
---
Time to join the dwarf master race my friend
---
He is talking about LFR specifically I believe
---
When I was a we lad, a pal ( dwf rogue) and I (ne hunter) wandered to Scarlett monastery and got jumped by a group of horde. I realized I could Rez above them. They searched and searched for me and my friend, when they scattered I rained arrows upon the scattered flock and one by one murdered each one of them.
---
In Wotlk yeah, but this is a Classic WoW subreddit. In Classic WoW threat is the biggest mechanic that you have to deal with. Even bosses that are tauntable you still want to be pushing threat because a taunt can be resisted.
---
And then of course every boss in AQ40 and Naxx is immune to taunt. 
---
Corruptdad - Gnome Warlock - TBC
---
I had killed everyone onsite before him but I decided I'm not bothered and let him live as I enjoy winter spring, I was planning on this being a zone of cleansing for my character. My mistake as he turned on me when I was pulling, sprinter and gourged his felguard and finished him within seconds but the lingering dots and mobs finished me.
---
For the next several hours I would predict where he'd respawns and kill him the instant he sat down to drink as I wanted to waste his time and resources.
---
After he stopped respawning, waited 30 minutes whilst doing some studies I decided to move on. But from that moment, I created a /tar macro that was my generic kill list of people who I'd hunt.
---
Whenever he would appear everything else would cease and I would camp him for hours. Eventually he would call his 70 guildies to assist, then it was a different game all together.
---
Wait for the 70 to leave, then for him to start questing to kill him and escape before the 70 returns.
---
TL:DR I let a gnome live once, it backfired and camped him for the end of vanilla &amp; tbc.
---
The real brand vs. the Costco imitation challenge?
---
Most specs were viable in PvP. I'm not actually aware of any of the original 27 trees you couldn't Excel with, even survival was viable. 
---
Dwarf rogue don't be that try hard. Go daggers and enjoy the loot
---
Ah in that case I would disagree about letting more players see the raid content makes it worse, but it certainly is a far cry from vanilla and that experience folks are looking forward to in Classic.  
---
Just play Dwarf. They are easily the coolest race on the Alliance in vanilla
---
https://i.imgflip.com/2bdm8a.jpg
---
I’d still stand by the fact that it was the lack of communication, although LFR IS so easy it’s retarded. When raid mechanics don’t need to be followed to win, the raid is pointless 
---
The world's longest recorded living bear was Debby, a female polar bear born in the Soviet Union at some point in 1966. She died on November 17th 2008 in Canada at either age 41 or 42.

I'd doubt it, but I'd appreciate it.

---
If you really love a class and its lore as you do, you should go for it.  Ret pal in vanilla is *not* shit, and *especially* if your main interest is pvp, you don't have to worry as much about a guild leader telling you to respec for a Ragnaros fight or something.
---
You'll be more than fine.  You can watch some vids and kick ass and practice.  Better that than rolling a warrior and then running into a Ret pal in a BG who is living the life you wanted and doing great while you settled for something else ;)
---
That's what everyone closes with **even in the min-max videos on YouTube about "what class should I play"**
---
Hi, /u/Oreoloveboss
---
Ret leveling is not that bad. You don’t do crazy damage but you never die and have very little downtime. It’s typical hybrid leveling: Faster than rogue or warrior but slower than casters and pet classes. 
---
My gf loves fantasy and etc, but she stays away from multiplayer games cause when she tried to before she was greeted with so much toxicity. It took her awhile but when she watched me play wow she eventually wanted to try to play.
---
They're low key the best horde race for Rogue. Stuns are a Rogue's biggest weakness, resisting a HoJ or a 5 point KS is so satisfying.
---
You shame the wholesome Taurens by mocking the greatness that is Thunder Bluff.
---
Please reroll as Alliance you traitor &gt;:(
---
Yea there might not be any map quests, etc but there sure will be some major time and effort required to just play the game. I hope you are ready. Caches and Blue exclamations were a walk in the park considering all "must do" things needed to progress through Classic. Attunements being the major one.
---
It's all about revenge.
---
I think I was around 30-40lvl huntard getting his ass handed over in STV by undead rogues on a PvP realm. I had enough of getting killed tirelesly and hopped in a group heading to Scarlet Monastery. I was a noob back then and didn't even know where the instance was, and to my surprise it caused terrible triggers from my experiences in Stranglethorn Vietnam. Hundreds of undead rogues leveling on their starting zonr just was too much and in rage I slaughtered every single one of those that had flagged PvP on. I was feeling so good, the satisfaction of giving back was enormous but at that moment I unknowingly made tens of future STV bad boys - just to keep the cycle going... 
---
"Create your own server", nice joke. Discord owns all servers and all your conversations pass through a centralized service. Hard pass. There's a reason they don't even offer self-hosted servers, because their business model relies on everything padding through them. 
---
Stock up on wood and camp her
---
Gank her. Get your honor. If you do it often enough, the divorce thing will happen on its own. (Seriously, don’t)
---
Yea, as an Alliance lock, that move set worked well on an *Orc* rogue, but not the Undead ones (and Trolls were rarer in my sightings). However, even against the Undead, you have a (small) chance to be able to get your Succ to charm the rogue, they pop WotF, then you Death Coil then, since it does not count as a Fear, make some distance, and hopefully have Succ re-Charm, or maybe switch demons and Fear instead. With a rogue it's a tougher call than a warrior bc you can't just Charm-spam them, you need to keep DoTs going so they can't Vanish. Hence, I'd probably try to Fear, get a couple DoTs going, and make some distance, bandage up, and pop the 0.5 sec demon summon for a Void against a rogue. But all that is still very tough if you don't do it all fast enough. 
---
On a Horde warlock, I imagine the sequence is easier more of the time.
---
To be blunter than the other 2 comments - you cannot force someone to enjoy something. You can give them help and opportunity, but if the interest isn't there it cannot be produced by stockholm syndrome. Trying to is a recipe for disaster.
---
I can only go off the little info in this post, but I'd recommend curating encounters that will appeal to her. Would she be most attracted by exploration/seeing the world? By socializing in guilds, or in parties? By the grind, or the end-game potential? Once you know what she needs to see, you can tailor a way to expose her to it. Set things up &amp; invite her to sample a couple of them, but be prepared if classic just isn't up their alley. 
---
If you want to DPS Warlocks always have lower numbers than hunters/mages/rogues/warriors on private servers, and they’re always in demand due to the huge utility they bring to a raid.
---
They’re particularly underplayed on Alliance as WOTF is a massive annoyance if you want to PvP so Horde is more attractive to a PvPing Warlock (IMO, the advantage is massively overstated, Warlocks are beasts in PvP whatever the faction).
---
It would be very cool, but if they don't the subreddit could always take up the mantle.  
---
I agree with you. It's both and it's correlative. When you don't have to try to win, be it in a group or raid, you don't take the effort to develop socially and because of that the game feels empty
---
Haha yeah that’s what I was thinking. 
---
Selling bwl carries would be way more lucrative but I’d probably need some friends to come in on razorgore to do the orb for me because I don’t think I have enough fingers for that.
---
I'm a full horde player, BUT:  
---
I love Vanilla Alliance.

Iron Forge and Stormwind are amazing cities, the Alliance racials are super cool, the starting zone of the Ne are in my opinion the most beautyful in the game.  
---
You can become a Furbolg(!!!).  
---
And you have damn beautyful starter leveling zones, not to mention the first dungeon, Deadmines.
---
You will not regret it, swapping sides.
---
Particularly you won't stick to something as superficial as factions in a videogame, I know so because:  
---
You chose to spend your whole life on the side of a woman, which has much higher sacrificial value then the former!  
---
I never thought it was the easy mode that was the problem, it was LFR.
---
I’m all for people being able to see the end game content.  I thought the raid wide buff for ICC balanced that well and let otherwise bad players kill LK (the ultimate goal of the xpac).
---
However, LFR and LFD take away so much interaction in the world and community.  Seeing masses of guilds outside of BT/Ulduar made the zones feel insurmountable.  
---
Each server had individuals and guilds who were known for leading successful PUGs.  It made community reputation matter.  It strengthened social bonds; you had to beg your raiding friend to bring his healer alt to fill out the raid.
---
Overall, that was the no1 thing that bled out the WoW community for me.

The shitty Horde leveling zones are precisely why I corpse camp Alliance whenever I see them. Well, one of the reasons anyway. 
---
You think you do, but you do. 
---
Depends on gear level. Early 60 this is for sure true. Moving into AQ40 though. As a Shaman you should win against a rogue most of the time. You simply get too much armor, killing power, and HP for them to deal with you.
---
It will be a while before Tribute runs become a thing because Dire Maul won't be in at launch.
---
okay, incel
---
Only the most autistic guilds are going to give you shit about being a non-human rogue.  
---
I've thought about this some as well. I REALLY REALLY want to play Shadow Priest but I also want to raid. I'm concerned with the extra amount of gold I'll have to have just to keep up with all the respecing because as everyone knows no one brings a Shadow Priest.
---
Easy modes dont ruin a game unless it empeds the normal mode or hard mode
---
Eh... They fit well with the edgy emo mustache twirling of the Royal Apothecary element of the Forsaken. They fit much less well with Thrall's seeking-redemption-and-a-new-way-forward-in-a-hostile-world Horde. They never really had any interest in redemption or reformation, all they were looking for was a new fix to feed their addiction.
---
All of which is beside the fundamental point that *elves don't belong in the cussing Horde.*
---
troll females are pretty hot.
---
I realized that I never seriously leveled a Horde in vanilla, or even played a Priest, Shaman, or Druid. Part of me wants to roll a Human Warrior for old times sake, but the other wants to roll a Troll Priest for an entirely new experience.
